Millions of people worldwide have adopted WordPress, and its popularity  continues to increase. In February 2011, WordPress.org reported over 32.5 million  downloads of WordPress version 3.0. When you combine all the WordPress users  that haven't yet upgraded, it's obvious that WordPress is firmly established as one of  the most popular web publishing platforms.  Its popularity is well-deserved. WordPress is easy to use, fun, efficient, and, as we  will learn in this book, creates search engine-friendly websites.  This book offers a practical, hands-on approach to installing, building, and  optimizing a WordPress blog or website in a way that search engines will love.   We'll unlock the hidden and not-so-hidden elements that search engines look for  when they return search results for their visitors. We'll also look at a wide range of  new ways to market your website or blog through secondary channels such as video  sites and social media, and we'll learn that WordPress is particularly well-suited for  extension into these other channels.  We'll learn about Google's recommended best practices and how to implement the  best ranking strategies when planning and executing your web marketing plan. We'll  learn to identify and safely avoid a host of forbidden black hat techniques that search  engines frown upon.  We'll learn the full spectrum of search ranking factors and techniques: keyword  research, title tag optimization, link building, site architecture, and more. Finally,  we'll take everything we learn about search optimization and learn how to  implement it on the WordPress platform.  With the tools in this book and the inherent power of WordPress, you have the  opportunity to create a high-ranking website that can compete with any search  engines in the market.  [ xi ]  www.it-ebooks.info   What this book covers Chapter 1, Getting Started – SEO Basics, covers the basics of SEO from start to finish,  introducing topics such as on-page ranking factors, how search engines work, and  link building. Chapter 2, Optimizing WordPress for SEO, helps align your SEO strategy with the  WordPress platform and solidify your plan. You'll need to set realistic goals and  timelines for your business or website through educated investigation and analysis.  Proper and thorough planning will ensure that you'll succeed even in competitive  search markets. Chapter 3, Researching and Working with Keywords, begins by building a keyword list  based on what you have to offer consumers. We'll examine whether it's wiser to  focus on a few high-value terms or to build a broader keyword list and rank for a  wide variety of phrases. You'll learn how to group the keywords into manageable  groups and how to leverage the grouped keywords for maximum SEO benefit. Chapter 4, Understanding Technical Optimization, covers how to take what you've  learned about keyword research and implement a ranking strategy. You'll learn  how to build a perfect web page: a web page where all the elements work together to  achieve maximum ranking power. You will also learn how to craft a domain name  that is well-poised to rank for primary keywords. We will examine how to create an  effective WordPress permalink structure. Chapter 5, Creating Optimized and Engaging Content, shows you how to better engage  visitors with your content. You'll learn how to write effective titles and headlines— how to grab readers' attention from the start. Chapter 6, Link Building, covers some general topics in link building such as how and  where to get links. You'll learn about PageRank, Google's trademarked and patented  process to count the inbound votes that we receive as links from other websites. Chapter 7, Using Social Media, shows you how to harness social media in order to  promote your company or website and supplement your search strategy. Chapter 8, Avoiding the Black Hat Techniques, takes you on a tour through the seedy  side of SEOs. We'll examine a wide range of black and gray hat techniques—and  why it is imperative that you avoid them. Chapter 9, Avoiding SEO Mistakes, examines the errors in keyword research that  can lead to ranking trouble in the future. We will look at the complex challenges  surrounding site architecture and some common mistakes that webmasters make.  [ xii ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10, Testing Your Site and Monitoring Your Progress, covers a range of tools with  which you can monitor the quality of your website, learn how search spiders interact  with your site, measure your rankings in search engines for various keywords, and  analyze how your visitors behave when they are on your site. Appendix A, WordPress SEO Plugins, discusses some of the most helpful and powerful  plugins that can help you take your WordPress site to the next level. Appendix B, Other SEO Resources, provides you with some resources that can help  you stay on top of search engine optimization for your website.  What you need for this book Some prior knowledge of WordPress is expected but no prior knowledge of search  engine optimization is required to use this book. You'll need to begin with a working  installation of the self-hosted version of WordPress.  Beyond that, you'll need little more than a web browser and your wits. All the tools  in this book—including the installation of powerful WordPress plugins—can be  accessed through your web browser.  Who this book is for This book is written for anyone using WordPress, ranging from owners of business  sites to website developers and blog owners. Any WordPress user who wants to sell  products or services or send out a message to the world will find that getting better  rankings in the search engines will help them reach their goal faster.

[ xv ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started – SEO Basics  Welcome to SEO for WordPress! This title is intended to take you through the  steps required to make your blog or website rank in popular search engines such  as Google, Yahoo, Bing, and more. If you've selected WordPress as the platform for  your site, you have made a good choice. WordPress is both powerful and easy to use,  and ideally suited for both large collaborative blogs and small business websites.  Even better, WordPress has innate characteristics that search engines love: simple  navigation, SEO-friendly URL naming conventions, easy publishing, and more. With  the tools in this book, you can take your WordPress blog or site to the next level.  Whether you want to increase the reach and broadcasting power of your blog, or  edge out the competition in search results for your small business, you'll find the  tools and the guidance within these pages.  In this book, we will take an in-depth look into how to apply sound and tested  search engine optimization techniques to the success of your WordPress website   or blog.  So, let's get started.  In this first chapter, we will cover the basics of SEO from start to finish. This chapter  is not intended as a complete search engine optimization guide; we simply won't  have the opportunity to cover any individual topic with the depth that it requires. It's  more important at this stage just to explore a general overview.  For some of you, these concepts will be a review while for others these concepts will  represent the foundation upon which your more advanced knowledge of search  engine optimization will be built.  [ 1 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Introducing SEO Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, is the process and discipline of improving the  quality and visibility of a website in order to increase its ranking in search engines,  thereby increasing visitor traffic. That's a simple definition, but it captures the  essence of SEO.  Webmasters started optimizing websites in the mid-90s soon after search engines  began cataloguing the growing number of websites that were appearing on the  internet. The term "search engine optimization" is believed to have come into   use in 1997.  The roots of modern-day search optimization actually began decades earlier with the  original database query technologies of the 1960s. The first search technologies were  much simpler than today. A typical database query in the 1960s might search a few  hundred thousand records for a specific term, such as, a city name or zip code. At the  end of 2014, Google had indexed 30 trillion webpages using 920,000 servers.  SEO can be quite powerful: it can mean the difference between hundreds or  thousands of engaged and relevant visitors to your website or nearly no visitors at  all. In almost any marketplace for goods and services on the Internet, you can see  businesses with top rankings enjoying financial prosperity.  The first 10 search results for a query—the first page of search results in nearly all  search engines—is now universally seen as a highly desirable target placement.  Indeed, statistics generally show that a very small number of search users ever look  beyond the first page of search results; most studies reveal that only between 6  percent and 3 percent of all search engine queries result in a visit to the second page  of search results—a meager portion.  SEO levels the playing field. Access to media such as, newspapers, magazines, and  television used to be reserved for those willing to pay for the privilege. Nowadays,  a small home-based business can compete for new business—sometimes quite  effectively—with the largest Fortune 500 company.  Google doesn't care how big your office is, how many trucks your business uses in  its distribution chain, or how many high-definition cameras you employ to produce  your blog; Google has no way of knowing, and they probably wouldn't care. What  Google can do, however, is apply its sophisticated algorithm to the content of your  website's pages and the content of the sites that link to you.  [ 2 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There is a common joke about two campers in a forest that are approached by a bear.  One camper reaches immediately for his running shoes. The other camper asks, why  are you putting on those running shoes, you can't outrun that bear? The other camper  replies, I don't have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you. That's how search  placement works: you simply need to do a little bit more than the next guy. There  is no minimum threshold for obtaining a search ranking other than the threshold  established by your search competitors. Do a little bit more, be a little bit smarter,  and your rankings will rise. SEO has several close relatives. SEM, or search engine marketing, is a broader term  that refers to SEO as well as paid search placement, contextual advertising, and paid  inclusion advertising. It is also important to think of SEO as including conversion  optimization—the study and practice of improving the conversion of visitors to  customers after they visit your web page.  Always consider that a search engine's core purpose is to deliver relevant search  results to a user entering a query.  Older readers will recall using the Lycos search engine at one time, but almost no  one uses the service any more. Why not? Because the Lycos search engine didn't  return very good results for users. Either the results were not relevant, or the results  were diluted with ads. For whatever reason, Lycos was not as good as Google at  delivering a relevant set of usable results in response to a query.  It's important to keep in mind the role of the search engine. Too often, webmasters  think or say Google is against them because Google appears to rank lower-value sites  in favor of their own. The truth is the exact opposite: Google wants you to rank—as  long as your result serves the needs of its user base. You need to give Google what  it's looking for  or Yahoo or Bing, as the case may be , and Google will rank your   site higher.  Improving your rank on all search  engines While Google is the leading search engine in the Western Hemisphere, there are,  of course, alternative search engines such as Yandex in Russia and Baidu in China.  The fortunes of the various search engines ebb and flow, with Google maintaining a  commanding lead. Comscore.com is a well-regarded analyst of search engine metrics  and reports that in 2014, Google's share of US search queries at about 75 percent, Yahoo  at about 10 percent, and Bing Microsoft at about 10 percent. The remaining field is  made up of a handful of 3rd-tier search engines like Ask.com  http:  www.ask.com  ,  Blekko.com  http:  blekko.com  , and hundreds of smaller search engines.  [ 3 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   So, how does one rank for all search engines? The answer is easy: optimize for  Google. Google's search algorithm is the most advanced, and is certainly the best at  detecting disfavored optimization techniques such as keywords stuffing, paid link  arrangements, and the like. Furthermore, Google's technology is so dominant that  the other search engines imitate most of Google's innovations.  And so, if you rank well for Google, you'll certainly be well-positioned to rank well  in the other search engines. Keep in mind, however, that Google is also the most  responsive search engine. Google crawls  visits  your site more often, and indexes  websites faster than the other search engines. So, as you work on optimization, you  might see positive changes in Google rankings in a few weeks, whereas the other  search engines might take months to respond.  Exploring the changing nature of search  engines Keep an open mind about what constitutes a search engine. The traditional definition  of a search engine—a destination website into which desktop-based users enter  typed search queries is already eroding. For several years, Google has been testing,  tweaking, and improving its voice recognition system. It was clear early on that  Google had already envisioned a day in the near future where search queries would  be voiced rather than typed. Sure enough, the increasingly popular Android mobile  device platform has voice recognition technology integrated into its architecture.  The near future will bring further progress in the types of devices on which users  perform searches as well as the input device into which these searches are made.  Near term trending shows that we'll see growth in both mobile-based searches  and voice-input searches. Staying ahead of trends in search can help you best your  competitors in search rankings.  While the type of input device doesn't necessarily change the fundamental nature  of search, the increasing variety of specialized search properties does. In recent  years, an increasing number of specialized sites have emerged for special-purpose  searches. Yelp.com is a destination site for people seeking highly recommended local  businesses and hot spots. Dedicated apps like Restaurant Finder on popular mobile  platforms help users find restaurants near their current location. Goby is a recent  search engine specifically designed to help users find activities in a local area. This is  a trend—the first search engines were either directories, single search boxes, or both.  Now, there are thousands of individual properties employing hundreds of different  approaches to search.  [ 4 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding a search engine's inner  workings One of my favorite academic questions to ask people about search technology is,  when do you think internet searching was invented? While the exact date is elusive, the  answer is nearly always wrong—by several decades. Routinely, people reflect the  common understanding that search technology was invented in the 1990s.  Actually, a search engine merely employs search query and indexing principles  that were conceived and implemented decades before in a mainframe environment.  Indexing, coupled with search queries, allowed early computer operators to quickly  select relevant information from large databases in the infancy of the computer age.  The Internet is simply a much larger database and a modern search engine is simply  a much more robust and sophisticated search query tool.  Preparing the index A search engine does not store your web pages, it stores an index of your web  pages. For your page to appear in a search engine's index, first that search engine  sends a search spider to visit your site and read your web pages' content. The spider  returns the information to a document processor that processes your web pages into  a format that the query processor understands. The document processor performs  several formatting tasks—it might remove stop words, lower-value terms that bear  little relation to the page's topic, such as the, and, it, and many more. The document  processor will also perform term stemming, where suffixes like -ing, -er, -es, and -ed  are stripped from search terms. In essence, a document processor trims the content to  reveal the contextual elements of a web page and prepares the entry for indexing.  The index contains much of the information from your pages, along with other  data that the search engine uses to evaluate and categorize your pages. As a highly  simplified example, Google's index of your page will contain the text of your page on  a date in the recent past when its spider last visited along with other data which are  as follows:     A table of terms in order of the frequency in which they appear on your page    called the inverted file      The page's PageRank    A term weight assignment: a numerical value that reflects the frequency of   appearance of particular terms on a page     The page's meta tags    The page's destination URL  [ 5 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This description is grossly simplified, but illustrates that what the search engine  attempts to match is not your page itself, but a processed and analyzed version   of your page.  Querying the index Once the index is prepared, the page is available for querying. The query processor,  along with a search and matching engine, performs the nuts and bolts of the search  function—matching a user's query to stored entries in the search engine's index. The  final element is a sound methodology for ranking the query results. If all works as  planned, the search engine returns a sensibly ordered set of results to each user's query.  Peeking into the mechanics of search gives us a few guidelines to follow. One core  principle that emerges is this—words are the food upon which search engines  feed. Without relevant, contextual words on your pages, the search engines cannot  accurately index your pages. The other important idea is that a search engine  searches an index—it doesn't search your pages directly. So, if your pages aren't in  the index, they aren't going to be found. These concepts will re-emerge as we work  through the chapters in this book.  Exploring on-page search ranking factors SEO professionals lump search engine optimization techniques and thought into  three categories—on-page optimization, off-page optimization, and conversion.  On-page optimization is concerned with all of the text, images, code, words,  navigation, structure, and so on that appear on your website—all of the factors you  control that appear on-page. Off-page optimization refers to all of the material on the  Internet concerning or pointing to your website that does not appear on-page; for the  most part, off-page optimization refers to inbound links on third-party websites.  Conversion refers to how effective your website is at making users take actions,  once they appear on your site. A high-performing website needs all three elements  working together.  On-page factors include the following:     The body content—the main text of the page    Title and meta tags    Heading tags  h1, h2, h3     The quality and complexity of the HTML and CSS code that generates    the webpage     The images, their filenames and alt tags  [ 6 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Text attributes such as the use of bold and underline    Outbound links—their number and the anchor text used in each    The use of either dofollow or nofollow attributes on any of the links    The internal navigation and link structure    The size of your files and the speed at which your website loads    The total number of pages on your website    The rate at which you update or add content to your website  But how important are each of these factors? How do we know that one factor   is more important than another? The software or programs that Google and the   other search engines use to determine rankings are referred to as an algorithm.   While the behavior of search engines can sometimes appear remarkably intuitive   and almost human, the science underlying a search algorithm is ultimately reduced  to complex mathematics.  Weighing search factors Not all on-page elements are as important as others—search engines must assign  particular importance or weight to various on-page factors. A webpage's title tag,  for example, is widely considered to be a strong indicator of the subject matter  of a webpage. As such, a title tag has a very strong influence on search rankings.  Conversely, the filenames of the images on a webpage, such as texas_web_ marketing.jpg, would not necessarily be a strong indicator of the subject matter  of a webpage. So, search engines apply much less weight to image file names in  their ranking algorithms. The basket of on-page factors that influence search engine  rankings are afforded a wide variation in influence in search engine rankings—this  variance is referred to by SEO professionals as weight. Title tags and heading tags are  afforded greater weight, while image filenames, alt tags  text tags that accompany  images , and bold text are given less weight. That is not to say that bold text and  image filenames are not important. In fact, it's the use of these lower-weight attributes  that can give a webpage the extra push to higher rankings. When all of the ranking  factors are present and utilized effectively and combined with a sound program of  developing inbound links, the effect is almost supernatural—the combined effect of  all factors working together can develop tremendous ranking power.  [ 7 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding the search algorithm The details of Google's search algorithm are not disclosed to the public. Google's  public statements, Webmaster guidelines, and patent filings give us some general  insight into the overall approach of its search algorithm. But the details are closely  guarded secrets. For example, how does Google's algorithm treat a title tag—how  much weight is afforded to this important component of a webpage? Is it 30 percent?  20 percent? Even if we did know, Google's search algorithm is subject to constant  tweaking and updating. So, we know that a webpage's title tag is important, but the  actual numerical importance within the Google algorithm, we will never know.  So, if the relative importance of different ranking factors isn't publicly disclosed,   how do we even know which ranking factors are more important? The answer lies  a little bit with the search engines' public statements, a little bit with logic, a little bit  with experience, and a little bit by the consensus developed by SEO professionals  and hobbyists.  We will examine each of these ranking factors in turn.  Ranking factor – body content Body content simply means the words on the page, actual ASCII text readable by a  search engine. This important factor is too often ignored by webmasters. Some of   the most egregious examples of webmasters that miss this important factor are  sites with little or no text, sites that rely on image files to display text and messages,  and flash-based sites. Search engines do not read the text in pictures or effectively  read the text in flash files. So, if you are describing your service in an image file,  JavaScript, or a flash file, your message will not be read, and you will not rank for  those terms.  A search engine needs to be able to find text on a webpage in order to make an  evaluation of what your page is about. The text on your pages should meet the  following rules:     Size: A webpage should have at least 250 words of readable ASCII text    Focus: A webpage should be focused on a reasonably narrow set of   keywords     Keyword Density: A webpage should not have keywords repeated,   so that the density of the keywords is too high in relation to the total   number of words  [ 8 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A webpage should be of a reasonable length, at least 250 words. A page length of   400 or 500 words is better, but one can get by with shorter pages in some cases. In a  more competitive search market, 250 words may not be enough and you'll need to  increase your page length to rank effectively.  A webpage's body text should be focused—the page should speak to a narrow set  of keyword phrases and not try to cover too much ground. If your webpages cover  too many separate topics or keyword phrases in one page, you'll dilute the ranking  power of each individual phrase and you'll rank for nothing.  You need to stay on-topic. If you are creating a page describing your expert IT  services, don't fill the page up with 60 percent testimonials; those testimonials  may have value to your readers—and testimonials certainly have a place and a  role in creating websites where your target readers are potential customers—but  testimonials will not necessarily contain the keywords for which you want to rank.  So, keep your webpages' body text focused on the topic of that page.  Similarly, don't cover too many topics within your body text. For example, say  you want to create an Amazon affiliate page on your website and try to rank for  WordPress books, Joomla books, and books on web design. If you try to rank for all three  keywords on one page, you'll have to divide your content among a discussion of  these separate topics. You'll dilute your ranking power for the phrase WordPress  books by repeating the terms Joomla books and books on web design within the body text  of your page. The better approach is to build three separate pages, each with a focus  on one related family of keywords. Conversely, if you wanted to rank for WordPress  books, books on WordPress, and best WordPress books, you could create a single page  to rank for all those terms because you can easily write body text which includes all  those phrases. Your focused page will rank quite well.  Serious ranking power – title tags and  meta tags Title tags and meta tags are strings of text that are inserted in the head section of a  webpage. These tags are inconspicuous to a user, although not entirely hidden. The  title tag appears in the top bar of the user's browser window, but does not appear  on the webpage itself. The meta tags do not appear to the user, they are intended for  search engines to read. The principal meta tags for use in search optimization are  meta keyword tags and meta description tags.  Title tags are the most important ranking factor on an individual webpage; they are  highly weighted by the search engines.  [ 9 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Often, a simple change to a title tag alone can yield significant changes in rankings.  Again, remember the role of a search engine to determine the topic of a webpage  and return relevant results to its users. The title tag, logically, is perhaps the greatest  signpost of what a page is actually about.  Title tags serve another important role, when a user enters a search query into a  search engine, the first line of each entry on a search engine results pages are taken  from each page's title tag. So, now your title tag presents an opportunity to attract  searchers to click on your result out of a field of other websites on a search engine  results page. Not only that, both Yahoo and Google bold the words used in the  search query within the title tags that they display on the search engine results page.  So, if you use keywords effectively in your title tag, Google will highlight your entry  in the search engine results page and that can help increase the click-through rate to  your website pages.  Making perfect title tags Keep in mind, space on a search engine results page is limited, so Yahoo and Google  don't show title tags longer than 56 to 60 characters. Try a search for almost anything  and you'll see that if the title tag of the destination webpage is too long, the search  engines truncate the title tag. Keep your title tags to 60 characters or less.  Also keep in mind that search engines measure keyword prominence in title tags.  This means that the first word in a title tag is afforded greater weight than the last  word in the title tag. Put into practice, this means you should put your company  name as the last word in your title tag and save the valuable and more prominent  area of your title tag  the first 30 to 40 characters  for keywords related to your  business or industry.  Your business' name is not a high-competition keyword Don't use your business' name or slogan in valuable on-page positions  like the first five words of your title tag—you'll likely rank for your  business' name even if that name doesn't appear in your title tag at  all because there's little competition for your business' name as a  search term. Save those key positions for high-volume, competitive  search terms, and use your business' name in less important positions  like in the body of your text or at the end of your title tag, after the  keywords. For example, an ideal title tag for a pet grooming service  would be Pet Grooming & Pet Care,  New York  The Pampered Pooch.  [ 10 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Meta keyword tags are the subject of some confusion and remain misused and even  abused. Some uninformed webmasters erroneously believe that stuffing keywords  into a keyword meta tag will help rank for those terms. That hasn't been true since  about 2000 or 2001, yet the myth persists. In fact, Google and Bing are both on record  as saying that their algorithms no longer takes into account meta keyword tags.  Similarly, meta description tags are no longer very relevant to search results.  However, meta description tags, like title tags, are used by search engines when they  display search engine results pages. On a Google search engine results page, the  description tag comprises the second and third line of each standard four-line entry.  This presents an opportunity for your description tag. Your description tag can  serve as a hook to readers to invite them to click on your result in lieu of all the other  search results.  Sell with your meta description Meta descriptions are not merely repositories for keywords! Your  meta description can hook customers and bring them to your site. Because search engines display the meta tag in search results  pages, that text may have quite a lot to do with whether a person  clicks on your link, or one of the 20 or so other links on a search  results page. Don't use tired, stale descriptions, give your meta  tag life and fire. See the following image for an example of an  expertly drafted meta tag.  Google will nearly always display some text on the second and third line of each  entry on its results page. What does Google display on search engine results pages if  no description tag is present? If Google finds no description tag present, its algorithm  will select some text from the body of the page and insert it as the description on its  search engine results pages. For obvious reasons, this result is not ideal.  The following screenshot of a Google search result demonstrates Internet company  SEOMofo's expert drafting of its meta description tag, which even includes a  message to Google employee Matt Cutts:  [ 11 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using heading tags  h1, h2, h3  The earliest specifications for HTML included provisions for document headings  and subheadings, elements known as heading tags. Heading tag elements begin at  h1 and progress to h6, each level is intended to represent an ordered and organized  taxonomy. These tags serve multiple roles.  As mark-up tags, these elements conveniently format the text elements to which  they are applied. For example, an h1 tag will generate large text, in a bold font, with  margins above and below—much like the headline in a newspaper article.  As HTML standards matured and CSS formatting became available in browsers,  many web designers abandoned heading tags in search of prettier formatting for  their headings. True, you can make text big and bold with CSS mark-up or with  HTML formatting; you can make any text look like a heading without utilizing  heading tags. However, in the world of search that is a blunder because you will  build almost no search engine ranking power from simply formatting text.  For search engines, heading tags serve a supplemental function beyond formatting.  Heading tags serve as signposts, that help search engines determine the context and  topic of a web page. Heading tags are certainly part of search algorithms, and are  given moderate weight in determining search position.  The best methodology for employing heading tags is to do the following. First, your  page should only employ an h1 tag once. The text of the h1 tag should describe the  main topic of the web page upon which it appears and should include the high-value,  high-volume keywords for which you want to rank. Next, at a minimum you should  employ both h1 and h2 tags. Your h2 tags should repeat your important keywords— but with additional terms to give context to the section that the h2 tag covers. For  example, if you are writing a page about air conditioning service and repair, you  might employ h2 tags with text such as, Your best choice for air conditioning service, and  Licensed and insured air conditioning service. The h3 tags are optional, but can come in handy for organizing longer pages. The  search engine ranking power of heading tags decreases as you progress from h1  down through the lower orders of heading tags. Thus, h1 tags are mandatory,  h2 tags are highly recommended, and h3 tags are necessary only in the most  competitive markets. Heading tags have a complementary effect when combined  with an effective title tag, body text, and meta description—when these elements are  in accord, a search engine can more comfortably determine the main context of a web  page, and can more confidently reward that web page with higher rankings.  Remember also, that keyword prominence applies to heading tags, so greater weight  is given to the words at the beginning of the tag.  [ 12 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Optimizing code quality and load speed Code quality is an often overlooked element of search ranking. Because it's  overlooked, it represents a great opportunity to edge out less alert or less informed  competitors. Code quality refers to the quality, amount, and load speed of the  code and image sizes underline your website. Search engines like quality code and  fast loading times; poor quality code and slow loading times mean a poor user  experience for searchers.  HTML is an open source family of mark-up languages designed with fairly strict  specifications set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C . These standards  are updated every few years and result in new versions of HTML, such as the  upgrade from HTML 4 to HTML 5.  When the code quality underlying a website does not meet the specifications of the  HTML standard, the website may not display properly in all browsers. If the code  is filled with errors or lacks proper elements such as an HTML doctype declaration,  then that website may actually perform poorly in search engines. To test your code  for validation, visit the W3C's free validator at https:  validator.w3.org .  The amount of code underlying the website can affect its load speed. The proper  use of CSS can help a website reduce mindless repetition of attribute statements like  font-size and color. Users of WordPress can worry less about code quality. Assuming  that the WordPress template employed by a website does not contain coding errors,  WordPress generally delivers very lean code that validates perfectly. You can test  your website's CSS code by using W3C's free CSS validator at https:  jigsaw. w3.org css-validator .  Image size can also affect load speed. Always be sure you are using a compressed  image format whenever possible. For example, use the JPEG format for photographs  with an appropriate amount of compression. The faster the images load, the faster  your webpages will load.  Menus, internal navigation, and link  structure Link architecture refers to the way a website's menus and navigation links are  constructed. Link architecture can be very powerful and it's also one of the hardest  topics in search to truly master.  [ 13 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The anchor text  the blue underlined text  of a website link is a ranking factor  whether that link is from a site linking into your site, or is simply a link on your  own site leading to another page within your site. For that reason, you have an  opportunity to rank for certain terms by carefully selecting the anchor text that  you use in your navigation menus. The most perfect example of the misuse of this  principle in practice is the common employment of the term Home as the anchor  text in navigation menus to point to a website's home page. A website's homepage  has more ranking potential than any interior page on a website. For that reason, the  anchor text pointing to the home page should be carefully selected. For example,  instead of Home, consider employing keyword-rich phrases such as Austin's Best  Carpet Cleaning or VW Repair as the navigation anchor text. Another common mistake in site architecture and site structure is the use of image  buttons for links. A link comprised solely of an image has no anchor text. It's a  missed opportunity to include a keyword in a text link and send a signal to the  search engines about what the topic of the destination page is. It's curious to see that  this practice is still employed so often.  Other issues arise in link architecture when the navigation menus are written in  JavaScript or Flash—search engines don't read those languages effectively. The safest  approach to constructing navigation menus is with HTML. If you require active  navigation—dropdown or flyout sub-menus—make sure they are constructed with  search-friendly code such as CSS. Or, the problem of shifting navigation, where the  navigation menus change as the user moves through a site. A good rule to follow  is that if navigation is confusing for users, it's probably confusing for search engine  spiders as well.  When securing inbound links from other websites, you would never want high  number high proportion links that all use the exact anchor text—you'll likely trip a  search engine filter if you do. Google wants to see natural linking patterns. A website  with hundreds of links that all have the same anchor text  that is, New York Dentist   does not look natural to a search engine, so a ranking filter would likely be imposed  by the search engine to knock that listing down a few pages. The anchor text you  choose for your site-wide navigation serves as an opportunity to use anchor text in  higher numbers and in higher proportion that you wouldn't use for external links.  The search engines have no anchor text penalty for your internal links, you can point  100 percent of your internal links to your front page with any anchor text you like.  [ 14 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, the great opportunity with link architecture is simply to make sure the  number and quality of links are pointing in greater numbers to the high-value pages  such as your home page and product pages, and are pointing in lower numbers  to your low value pages such as your privacy policy, your contact form, and your  return policy. An easy way to accomplish this, is to simply have your standard  navigation either horizontally at the top of your website, or on a left or right sidebar;  then, to send extra link power to your most important pages, create a footer with  links to your home page and a few other high-value pages. Additionally, you can  always create extra link power by creating text links to your key pages within the  body of text throughout your site.  WordPress handles link architecture well. WordPress presents very simple site-wide  navigation menus by default. In fact, many have criticized WordPress for not offering  users as much control over navigation menus as they would like. With WordPress  releases beginning with 3.0, however, WordPress users enjoy the ability to customize  navigation menus with the new menu feature, available under the appearance tab in  the WordPress dashboard.  For users less experienced with SEO, we recommend sticking with WordPress'  reliable default navigation.  The customizable navigation is flexible and powerful—but that flexibility and power  in inexperienced hands can yield poor search ranking results.  Image filenames and alt tags Image names and image alt tags are an example of a ranking factor that is afforded  lower weight in search rankings, that is, wordpress-expert.jpg as a filename in an  attempt to rank for WordPress expert. Certainly, image names alone will never make  anyone rank for any term or phrase that is highly competitive. However, image  names and alt tags can be effective as supplemental weight for search terms when  the more important elements such as title tags and heading tags are highly focused  and in accord.  [ 15 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text attributes – bold, italics, and  underline Emphasizing text with the use of bold and underline has long been known to have  a marginal effect on ranking. Search algorithms follow predictable logic—do the  elements of a web page serve to reliably indicate the subject of the web page, and if so,  to what degree? Text attributes do tend to indicate the subject and context of a page  but rarely to a great degree. Rightfully, text attributes are not given much weight.  Again, this technique is best used as a supplement to other stronger ranking factors.  This technique is commonly misused by inexperienced webmasters. While the effect  of the technique is slight, overzealous designers often employ the technique on  dozens of phrases on a web page. This technique will yield little to no effect, and will  almost certainly undercut your user experience.  The best practice is to employ text attributes for a maximum of two phrases per web  page—your primary keywords only.  Ranking factor – high page count There is a general rule that larger sites outrank smaller sites in search engine results.  Consider the collective effect of a large website: larger sites cover more topic areas,  and therefore more keywords and garner broader traffic. The broader traffic yields  larger numbers of inbound links from broader classes of other websites. In turn, the  site earns trust with search engines more quickly. Meanwhile, each individual page  within a site generates a small thimble of PageRank that can ultimately contribute  to the overall site PageRank. The collective effect of a large website can bring  tremendous ranking power.  The power of this simple device is available to everyone. You need not be an expert  at SEO—you simply need to start writing.  As a webmaster, you should always aspire to create a site that covers broad topic  areas. That does not mean have a blog about soccer, baseball, guitar greats, and  web design all jumbled together. It means that if your blog is about web design you  would have a range of topics discussed within that discipline, such as sound coding  practices, logo design, navigation tools, and web design trends. To a small business  owner employing WordPress as a Content Management System  CMS , that means  building a page for each city in which you offer services as well as offering free tips  and tools within the WordPress blog section.  [ 16 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In my web design and SEO business, I employ WordPress as both a CMS and  a blogging platform. I maintain pages for the main areas of interest to potential  clients: one page each for my service offerings  the pages are intentionally separated  for ranking purposes: SEO, web design, WordPress development, social media  marketing, call tracking, PPC management, and more , a page for a design gallery,  a page for SEO case studies, a page for testimonials, and some service and contact  pages. However, I utilize WordPress' blogging functionality to write  hopefully   helpful and valuable tips on SEO, such as How Does Google Local Order Its Search  Results, and Top Android Apps for SEO. Each month, I take the time to write about  three or four such posts. My site ranks highly, but more important to me is the high  number of search phrases for which my site ranks.  Anyone can rank for one search phrase. The truly exceptional sites, however, are the  sites that have broadness—the sites that rank for wider classes of keywords.  When your site has broadness, other benefits follow. First, you'll garner greater  numbers of inbound links—and you'll earn them from a greater variety of sources  more quickly than you normally would. Say you've are a web designer and you  write a blog post about an innovative CSS trick that you invented. Your blog post  will be of interest to other web designers and bloggers. With WordPress' innate  tagging functionality, your post will be easy for other webmasters to find. Those  other bloggers and designers might mention your post on their site with a link back  to you. Congratulations, you just earned a link to an interior page  links to interior  pages are usually harder to get than links to your front page  from a website within  the same niche as you  links from same niche sites carry more power . You just  earned a link that you otherwise would not have had.  Consider also the PageRank effect of that single page. PageRank is part of Google's  search algorithm; Google assigns a numerical value to each indexed page on the  Web. When an indexed page hyperlinks to another page on the Web  including  your own pages , a portion of that numerical value is passed from the linking page  to the target page, thereby increasing the target page's PageRank. Inbound links  increase your PageRank and in turn, your search rankings. The amount of PageRank  generated by a single page is admittedly slight—but it adds up quickly.  One of WordPress' most singular advantages as a search-friendly platform is that it  offers simple and speedy publishing of new content. If you have 15 minutes and a  good idea, you can create a decent page of new content. If you have 3 hours and a  great idea, you can create a great page of new content.  [ 17 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Fodder for search engines – fresh  content Search engines respond to fresh, original content. Even more, search engines love a  steady stream of fresh, original content.  I am sure we have all heard people talk about the website they are about to launch,  saying I am having a website built and it is almost finished. When I hear that exact  phrase—and I hear it a lot—I cringe just a bit and feel like responding, Really?  Well, my website will never be finished. That's because a website should be alive and  constantly changing. The old way of thinking about websites is that when a website  was finished, it would sit frozen and immovable until the next redesign. Even the  word site implies something fixed in the ground, not something constantly in motion.  A search engine sees a website for what it is. If a website has static content that never  changes, the search engine knows it. Over time, the search engine spiders will come  less often. Why send a search spider for content that doesn't change? The site will  not be seen by search engines as high-value to its users. On the other hand, publish  regular content to your site and the search engines will know it. In fact, search  engines are moving toward real-time search results, although this technology isn't  yet fully developed. The search engines will send spiders to your site more often  looking for both new content and changes to old content. Your site will rise in the  rankings. And, if that wasn't enough, new content will get a fresh content bump.  The fresh content bump refers to a supplemental boost in ranking power that search  engines assign to fresh content served up from blogging platforms like WordPress  for the first few weeks after the published date.  WordPress began as a pure blogging platform and the search engines see new  WordPress posts as timely, topical, and potentially newsworthy items. The search  engines reward new posts with a little boost in position. As time passes, the posts  will settle down in the rankings. You can use the fresh content bump to cleverly  schedule prime rankings for matters of seasonal interest to readers. For example, you  would write a post titled "Spring Activities in South Florida, 2016" where you deftly  advertise your scuba diving service along with other activities. If you time it right,  you'll get a boost in rankings right when the last tourists are having their vacations.  Your fresh content need not be entirely free give-aways with no benefit to you.  Your new content can be a post or page about how you now serve a new area; put  the name of the new town in the page as a keyword, and you'll rank for searches in  which that town name appears. Or, how about a page announcing a summer sale?  Google likes new content—but it doesn't have to be completely fantastic content  every time.  [ 18 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Another benefit: new content is great when it is new, but new content is also pretty  great when it is old. A site with continually fresh content becomes a very large site  very quickly. We discussed the benefits of a large site in the previous section.  If you are reading this book, you likely have a WordPress site or are considering a  WordPress site. With WordPress, your ease and speed of publishing is unmatched— you'll create new and better content faster than other webmasters, your site will be  alive with regularly fresh content and your site will grow up quickly.  Using the subtle power of outbound links You can also gain ranking power by making outbound links from your site to other  sites. The theory goes something like the following. You have a website for your  gardening business and you want to rank for the phrase "gardening service San  Diego." If you have an outbound link to other sites about gardening services and the  anchor text of that outbound link is "gardening service", then that link can serve as a  signpost to search engines that your site is about gardening services.  This technique has a potential disadvantage  there's disagreement within the SEO  community about this point that remains unresolved : by linking to other sites, you  are directing valuable PageRank away from your page to the page to which you are  linking. So, you lose some PageRank, but gain ranking power for the keyword. You  may not want to overdo it—maybe just a few outbound links on a few pages, and  always to reputable websites. This is a technique that requires some finesse, so you  might employ some testing to see where outbound linking can be most effective.  Understanding off-page ranking factors Off-page ranking factors can be summarized with one phrase: inbound links.  Inbound links from other websites are the real power that makes sites rank. In the  competitive search markets, links might comprise 80 to 90 percent of the work that  goes into a website.  Links are the power The best way to think of the relationship between on-page factors an off-page factors  is this: on-page factors are like tuning up a car for a race to make sure all the parts  run reliably and strongly, off-page factors are the fuel.  So, if your car isn't running right, all the fuel in the world isn't going to make it  go. Similarly, if you don't have any fuel, even the most highly-tuned car will go  nowhere. In the world of search optimization, you need both.  [ 19 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating natural links Google, more than any other search engine, was the great innovator with respect to  measuring inbound linking power and then adjusting search results in favor of sites  that enjoy high numbers of inbound links. The reasoning is sound: sites with high  numbers of inbound links are most likely superior websites, to those that have low  numbers of inbound links. This innovation that links between websites are votes for  the quality of the destination site, is now employed by all major search engines. And,  for the most part, the principle does ensure superior search results when users search  for information through a search engine.  What Google wants, ideally, is for inbound links to be natural links, not artificially  generated links. If a website owner earns inbound links through paid link-building  schemes, then the methodology is skewed—the lower value site that has paid for  inbound links now enjoys higher ranking power than a superior site with fewer  links. That result is not what is intended by the inbound link component of the  search algorithms.  The search engines know that in the real world, not all linking between websites  will be natural. They are fully aware that webmasters attempt to game the system  through a variety of linking practices that range from relatively innocent reciprocal  linking to more sinister practices, like automated forum spamming and hidden links.  Google forbids link schemes in its webmaster guidelines, and penalties are common.  The task for the legitimate webmaster is to secure links naturally. Natural linking  will ensure that your site will never suffer a penalty, and links that you obtain  naturally will carry much more power than links obtained through any schemes or  artificial means. We cover specific line building methods in Chapter 6, Link Building.  Avoiding over-optimization Over-optimization occurs when a website's elements are present in too high a  proportion or too high in power for a given keyword phrase. Over-optimization  yields poor search performance. An example of over-optimization would be the  incessant use of keywords on your website, so that your keywords represent 50  percent of the total density of words on the page. Another example would be a  website with 100 inbound links, all with the same exact anchor text. First-time SEO  hobbyists tend to be ensnared by over-optimization as they zealously pursue the  new elements of SEO that they learn; they stuff keywords into title tags, meta tags,  body text, and secure links all with the same anchor text.  [ 20 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Over-optimization is difficult to quantify, and can be difficult to detect and repair.  The best way to think about over-optimization is that websites should never be too  perfect. Remember, a search engine ultimately must employ mathematics to its ranking  criteria. It's easy for a search engine to mathematically determine that a page with a  keyword density—keywords as a percentage of total words on the page—exceeding 8  percent is attempting to game the algorithm and therefore should not be ranked.  Thinking about over-optimization in this way, repetition is often the main culprit. To  avoid over-optimization you'll need to be vigilant to watch for excessive repetition  of terms in the main elements of a website and in inbound links. In other words,  just do good writing and the rest will follow naturally. You wouldn't keep repeating  yourself in good writing.  Converting visitors to customers – the  third spoke of SEO Too often, people think of SEO solely in terms of ranking position. They forget that  if your website cannot turn that casual visitor into a customer—your ranking did  nothing for you except send a visitor to your site for a moment.  Conversion science is the discipline of making sure the visitors to your site take some  action to bring them closer to being a customer. Successful websites have specific  and effective calls to action. A call to action is a phrase, graphic, or a section of your  website that urges the visitor to take some tangible step toward becoming a customer  or user of your product or website. The call to action can be a box that says Call Now  for Immediate Service, Shop Now!, or Subscribe for Free! Get Updates by RSS.  A call to action doesn't necessarily mean that visitors purchase something right there,  but that they take steps toward becoming a purchaser.  Your call to action will differ based on the space in which you compete. If you are a  blogger and want to expand the reach of your blog, you'll want users to sign up to  your RSS feed, or follow you on Twitter. In more traditional business environments,  like retail and home services, you'll want people to call or e-mail to make an  appointment. In a full e-commerce environment, you'll want to immediately drive  people to make purchases.  [ 21 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The following screenshot shows an aggressive call to action in the home services   pool construction  niche:  For your calls to action to be effective, you need to keep them prominent, above the  fold  on the upper part of your web pages that are visible before scrolling down  is required , and persuasive. Above the fold is a term from the newspaper industry,  meaning above the halfway point where a newspaper was folded.  Another rule of conversions is to have fallback positions, a second best option. In  other words, if your users don't purchase something today maybe they'll sign up for  your Twitter feed, which lets you keep them updated to new products. Perhaps later,  these new contacts will eventually become customers.  [ 22 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating conversion-based websites Each competitive space is different. However, conversion science does teach a few  absolute principles that can help you create highly effective conversion-based websites:     Don't hide contact information. About 30 percent of all websites do not   display contact information prominently. In a business environment, this  mistake is pure suicide. Put that phone number and e-mail up top where  users can find it.     Put the meat where the eyes are. Use the "above the fold" portions your   header and sidebars for conversion tools and messages. Studies show that  user's eyes typically scan the top and sidebar areas for information. Don't  expect users to scroll to hunt for your phone number.     Mix it up. Some users like to call, others like to e-mail. Give users more than   one choice.     Don't frustrate your users by directing them to non-functioning elements. For   example, don't use Chat now buttons that lead to dead ends, that is, Chat is  not available right now. If you utilize a call to action, make absolutely sure the  action is available, even if it's a voice mail, that is still better than wasting a  customer's time.     Don't broadcast your poor service. Don't say To reach sales, call between 1pm  and 5pm. That's just begging your customers to go elsewhere. If you must be  out of the office  all of us must leave work sometimes  just send folks to a  friendly voicemail and return the call later.     Give fewer choices. Don't confuse readers with too many selections. If your  viewers get confused or overwhelmed, they might slip into choice paralysis.    Always give the next step. Don't lose your customers along the way. If they   don't buy, get them to sign up for your newsletter. If you convert them to  watch your video, make the next step an invitation to purchase.     Sell benefits, not features. Your car will run faster! will convert better than    Our fuel additives are the most powerful in the industry.     Use testimonials. Tell your customers what other users say about your service.    Guide their eyes and attention. You can literally point users to your desired   action with arrows and buttons.  [ 23 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The following screenshot of Google's Cloud Print service shows several elements of  expert conversion science at work. The user is guided visually to the call to action  with a clear and simple button in a contrasting color. The benefit, Print anywhere, from  any device, is short and clear. The page is uncluttered, which enables a clearer path to  action for the user. The placement of the conversion tool is above the fold:  Truly effective calls to action are going to differ widely depending on the space in  which you participate. You'll want to try different approaches and measure your  results. In Chapter 10, Testing Your Site and Monitoring Your Progress, we'll cover   how to measure the performance of your website.  Summary We covered a wide range of material in this first chapter. We covered all the major  disciplines within on-page optimization: body content, title tags, meta tags, heading  tags, and code quality and load speed. We examined lower-weight SEO factors such  as image filenames, alt tags, text attributes such as bold and underline, outbound  links, and discussed the benefits of larger websites with regularly freshened content.  Finally, we examined over-optimization and how to avoid it, and delved into the  fundamental principles of conversion science.  Now, we are ready to put these core concepts into practice, as we learn to take  WordPress' innate functionality to the next level.  [ 24 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Optimizing WordPress   for SEO  In this chapter, we'll align your SEO strategy with the WordPress platform and help  you solidify your plan. You'll need to set realistic goals and timelines for your business  or website through educated investigation and analysis. Proper and thorough planning  is needed to ensure that you succeed in the competitive search markets.  We will begin by setting up the goals for your Internet presence and determining  how to best leverage WordPress' flexibility and power for maximum benefit. We'll  examine how to best determine and reach out to the specific audience for your goods  or services. Different Internet models require different strategies. For example, if  your goal is instant e-commerce sales, you strategize differently than if your goal  is a broad-based branding campaign. We'll also examine how to determine how  competitive the existing search market is, and how to develop a plan to penetrate  that market.  It's important to leverage WordPress' strengths. WordPress can effortlessly help you  build large, broad-based sites. It can also improve the speed and ease with which  you publish new content. It serves up simple, text-based navigation menus that  search engines crawl and index easily. WordPress' tagging, pingback, and trackBack  features help other blogs and websites find and connect with your content. For these  reasons, and quite a few more, WordPress is search ready. In this chapter, we will  look at what WordPress already does for your SEO.  Of course, WordPress is designed as a blogging platform and a content management  platform—not as a platform purely for ranking. We'll look at what WordPress  doesn't accomplish innately and how to address that.  [ 25 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, we'll look at how WordPress communicates with search engines and   blog update services. Following this chapter, we'll know how to plan out a new   site or improve an existing one, how to gauge WordPress' innate strengths and  supplant its weaknesses, and learn how WordPress sites get found by search   engines and blog engines.  Setting goals for your business and  website and getting inspiration A dizzying variety of websites run on the WordPress platform, everything from  The Wall Street Journal's blog to the photo sharing comedy site PeopleofWalMart. com  http:  www.peopleofwalmart.com  . Not every reader will have purely  commercial intent in creating his or her web presence. However, nearly all  webmasters want more traffic and more visibility for their sites. With that in mind,  to increase the reach, visibility, and ranking of your website, you'll want to develop  your website plan based on the type of audience you are trying to reach, the type of  business you run, and what your business goals are.  Analyzing your audience You will obviously want to analyze the nature of your audience. Your website's  content, its design, its features, and even the pixel width of the viewable area  will depend on your audience. Is your audience in the 65+ age group? If so, your  design will need to incorporate large fonts and you will want to keep your design  to a pixel width of 800 or less. Senior citizens can have difficulty reading small text  and many use older computers with 800 pixel monitors. And you can forget about  the integrated Twitter and Facebook feeds; most seniors aren't as tuned into those  technologies as young people. You might simply alienate your target users by  including features that aren't a fit for your audience.  [ 26 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Does your audience include purchasers of web design services? If so, be prepared to  dazzle them with up-to-date design and features. Similarly, if you intend to rely on  building up your user base by developing viral content, you will want to incorporate  social media sharing into your design. Give some thought to the type of users you  want to reach, and design your site for your audience. This exercise will go a long  way in helping you build a successful site.  Analyzing your visitors' screen sizes Have you ever wondered about the monitor sizes of the viewers of your  own site? Google Analytics  http:  www.google.com analytics  ,  the ubiquitous free analytics tool offered by Google, offers this capability. To use it, log on to your Google Analytics account  or sign up if you don't  have one  and select the website whose statistics you wish to examine.  On the left menu, select and expand Audience, navigate to Technology,  then Browser & OS. Then just under the graph, select Screen Resolution.  Google Analytics will offer up a table and chart of all the monitor  resolutions used by your viewers.  Determining the goal of your website The design, style, and features of your website should be dictated by your goal. If  your site is to be a destination site for instant sales or sign-ups, you want a website  design more in the style of a single-purpose landing page that focuses principally  on conversions. A landing page is a special-purpose, conversion-focused page that  appears when a potential customer clicks on an advertisement or enters through a  search query. The page should display the sales copy that is a logical extension of  the advertisement or link, and should employ a very shallow conversion funnel. A  conversion funnel tracks the series of steps that a user must undertake to get from  the entry point on a website to the satisfaction of a purchase or other conversion  event. Shallow conversion funnels have fewer steps and deeper conversion funnels  have more steps.  [ 27 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When designing conversion-focused landing pages, consider if you want to eliminate  navigation choices entirely on the landing page. Logically, if you are trying to get a  user to make an immediate purchase, what benefit is served by giving the user easier  choices to click onto the other pages? Individualized page-by-page navigation can  get clunky with WordPress; you might want to ensure that your WordPress template  can easily handle these demands. Let's have a look at the following screenshot:  The previous screenshot shows the expert landing page for Netflix's Video  on demand service. Note the absence of navigational choices. There are other  sophisticated conversion tools as well: clear explanation of benefits, free trial,   arrows, and a color to guide the reader to the conversion event.  If you sell a technical product or high-end consulting services, you rely heavily on  the creation of content and the organization and presentation of that content on your  WordPress site. Creating a large amount of content covering broad topics in your  niche will establish thought leadership that will help you draw in and maintain  new customers. In sites with large amounts of educational content, you'll want to  make absolutely sure that your content is well organized and has an easy-to-follow  navigation.  [ 28 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you will be relying on social media and other forms of viral marketing to build  up your user base, you'd want to integrate social media plugins and widgets into  your site. Plugins and widgets are third-party software tools that you install on your  WordPress site to contribute to a new functionality. A popular sports site integrates  the TweetMeme and Facebook connect widgets. When users retweet or share the  article, it means links, traffic, and sales. When compounded with a large amount of  content, the effect can be very powerful.  Following the leaders Once you have determined the essential framework and niche for your site, look  for best-in-class websites for your inspiration. Trends in design and features are  changing constantly. Aim for up-to-the-minute design and features: enlightened  design sells more products and services, and sophisticated features will help you  convert and engage your visitors more. Likewise, ease of functionality will keep  visitors on your website longer and keep them coming back.  For design inspiration, you can visit any one of the hundreds of website design  gallery sites. These gallery sites showcase great designs in all website niches. The  following design gallery sites feature the latest and greatest trends in web design and  features  note that all of these sites run on WordPress :     Urban Trash  http:  www.urbantrash.net cssgallery  : This gallery   is truly one of the best and should be the first stop when seeking design  inspiration.     CSS Elite  http:  csselite.com  : Another truly high-end CSS galleries.   Many fine sites are featured here.  1.  CSSDrive  http:  www.cssdrive.com  : CSSDrive is one of the elite classes   of directories, and CSSDrive has many other design-related features as well.  For general inspiration on everything from website design to more specialized  discussion of the best design for website elements, such as sign-up boxes   and footers, head to Smashing Magazine, especially its inspiration category    http:  www.smashingmagazine.com category inspiration  .  Ready-made WordPress designs by leading designers are available for purchase  off-the-shelf at http:  themeforest.net . These templates are resold to others,  so they won't be exclusive to your site. A head's up: these top-end themes are full of  advanced custom features. They might require a little effort to get them to display  exactly as you want.  [ 29 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   For landing pages, get inspiration from retail monoliths in competitive search  markets. DishNetwork and Netflix have excellent landing pages. Sears' home  improvement division serves up sophisticated landing pages for services such as  vinyl siding and replacement windows. With thousands of hits per day, you can bet  these retail giants are testing and retesting their landing pages periodically. You can  save yourself the trouble and budget of your early-stage testing by employing the  lessons that these giants have already put into practice.  For navigation, usability, and site layout clues for large content-based sites, look for  the blogging super-sites, such as http:  blogs.wsj.com , http:  www.politico. com , http:  www.huffingtonpost.in , and http:  wikipedia.com.  Gauging competition in the search market Ideally, before you launch your site, you want to gauge the competitive marketplace.  On the web, you have two spheres of competition:     One sphere is traditional business competition: the competition for price,   quality, and service in the consumer marketplace     The other sphere of competition is search competition; competition for clicks,  page views, conversions, user sign-ups, new visitors, returning visitors, search  placement, and all the other metrics than help drive a web-based business  While this book is concerned with the search competition, you'll naturally want to  consider both as you grow your business.  The obvious way to get started gauging the search marketplace is to run some  sample searches on the terms you believe your future customers might use when  seeking out your products or services. The search leaders in your marketplace will   be easy to spot, they will be in the first six positions in a Google search.  While aiming for the first six positions, don't think in terms of the first page of a  Google search. Studies show that the first five or six positions in a Google search  yield 80 to 90 percent of the click-throughs. The first page of Google is a good  milestone, but the highest positions on a search results page will yield significantly  higher traffic than the bottom three positions on a search results page.  [ 30 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Once you've identified the five or six websites that are highly competitive, you want  to analyze what they're doing right and what you'll need to do to compete with  them. Here's how to gauge the competition:     Don't focus on the website in terms of the number one position for a given  search. That may be too lofty a goal for the short term. Look at the sites in  positions four, five and six. These positions will be your initial goal. You'll  need to match or outdo these websites to earn those positions.     First, you want to determine the Google PageRank of your competitor's  sites. PageRank is a generalized, but helpful indicator of the quality and  number of inbound links that your competitor websites have earned. Install  a browser plug-in that shows the PageRank of any site to which you browse.  For Firefox, try the SearchStatus plug-in  available at http:  www.quirk. biz searchstatus  . For Chrome, use SEO Site Tools by Sitexy  available  through the Google Chrome Extensions gallery at https:  chrome.google. com extensions . Both of these tools are free, and they'll display a wide  array of important SEO factors for any site you visit.     How old are the domains of your competitor websites? Older sites tend to   outrank newer sites. If you are launching a new domain, you will most likely  need to outpace your older competitors in other ways, such as building more  links or employing more advanced on-page optimization. Site age is a factor  that can't be overcome with brains or hard work  although you can purchase  an older, existing domain in the after market .     Look at the size and scale of competing websites. You'll need to at least   approach the size of the smallest of your competitors to place well.     You will want to inspect your competitors' inbound links. Where are they  getting their links from and how many links have they accumulated? To  obtain a list of backlinks for any website, visit the Open Link Profiler at  http:  openlinkprofiler.org. This free tool displays up to 1,000 links  for any site. If you want to see more than 1,000 links, you'll need to purchase  inbound link analysis software like SEO Spyglass from http:  link- assistant.com. For most purposes, 1,000 links will give you a clear picture  of where a site's links are coming from. Don't worry about high link counts  because low-value links in large numbers are easy to overcome; high-value  links like .edu links, and links from high PageRank sites will take more effort  to surmount.  [ 31 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      You will want to examine the site's on-page optimization. Are the webmasters   utilizing effective title tags and meta tags? Are they using heading tags and  is their on-page text keyword-focused? If they aren't, you may be able to best  beat your competitors through more effective on-page optimization.     Don't forget to look at conversion. Is your competitor's site well-designed to   convert his or her visitors into customers? If not, you might edge out your  competition with better conversion techniques.  When you analyze your competition, you are determining the standard you will   need to meet or beat to earn competitive search placement. Don't be discouraged by  well-placed competitors. Around 99 percent of all websites are not well optimized. As  you learn more, you'll be surprised how many webmasters are not employing effective  optimization. Your goal as you develop or improve your website will be to do just a  little bit more than your competition. Google and the other search engines will be happy  to return your content in search results in favor of others if you meet a higher standard.  Knowing what WordPress already does  for your SEO Now, we will turn to what WordPress accomplishes naturally for your SEO efforts.  Luckily, WordPress handles much—but not all of the nuts and bolts of search  engine optimization naturally. WordPress has an innate economical architecture  that generates lean and fast-loading code that search engines love. It enjoys respect  and familiarity among search engines, which aids in search spidering. It is a speedy  platform that lets you build bigger and better sites in less time. RSS feeds are built  in, so you can reach more readers quite easily. WordPress automatically builds  keyword-rich URL strings for further SEO benefit. And WordPress effortlessly builds  reliable text-based navigation. We'll handle each of these elements in turn and learn  how to harness these strengths for maximum benefit.  [ 32 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding WordPress' economical  architecture WordPress employs sound economical architecture to display pages reliably  and quickly. In the early days of HTML, each display element on a web page  was displayed through the use of markup tags such as <font face="verdana"  color="green">This is some text!  to display a string of green text in  the verdana font style. One of the inherent weaknesses of this approach was that it  led to the incessant repetition of markup tags. WYSIWYG editors  what you see is  what you get  compounded the problem by tending towards excessive repetition of  markup tags: a web page with 20 paragraphs might have 20 font declarations, one  for each paragraph. Repeating markup code makes websites display more reliably,  but it makes them far less efficient because they take longer to load and longer for  the browser to process the markup.  There is another inherent problem. If you wanted to change the text on your website  from green to black, you would have to edit each individual font color declaration  throughout your site.  With the advent of CSS  cascading style sheets , the declarations for every element  on a web page could be made either at the head of the page, or ideally in an off- page text file called a stylesheet. This answered the issue of both the uneconomical  repetition of the markup, as well as giving webmasters the ability to change a single  element sitewide by changing one declaration. With well-crafted CSS, pages display  more quickly and hence rank better.  WordPress' internal architecture is entirely CSS-based. Unless the WordPress  template is poorly coded, WordPress uses off-page CSS stylesheets to define  elements. A WordPress page might display with 180 lines of code, where the  equivalent page created by a static WYSIWYG editor might display 350 lines   of code. Pages load faster, so the search engines respond with good rankings   and users enjoy a good experience while visiting your site.  WordPress' inherent economy doesn't end there. WordPress pages are generated  quickly and neatly by a simple and quick processing engine. WordPress sites generate  proper, valid HTML code that search engines love, although a poorly-crafted  WordPress template can undermine code quality.  [ 33 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building large sites quickly with WordPress WordPress began its history as a blogging publishing platform. Even as WordPress  has matured into a capable content management platform, it has retained the  features that make it adapt as a speedy and agile publishing tool. WordPress will  enable you to create content more quickly than other platforms and certainly more  quickly than with static HTML pages.  Search engine optimization relies on content. The more content that appears on your  site, the more opportunities you will have to rank for the wider families of keyword  phrases. Also, each page of content on your website contributes to the whole.  Remember, all indexed web pages generate PageRank. So, even a minor page on  your website generates a small thimble of PageRank, which contributes to the overall  ranking power of your site.  Earning respect with search engines WordPress enjoys both respect and familiarity from search engines. When a  search engine encounters a website with unusual or non-standard navigation, the  search engine must do its best to follow the navigation to the deepest files within  the website's organizational structure. If the search spider cannot reliably and  confidently follow a website's navigation to discover the deepest pages within  a website, then those pages are unlikely to be indexed. Because of WordPress'  reliability and familiarity to search engines, spidering errors almost never occur.  Because of the sheer number of installations worldwide, search engines crawl and  index content on WordPress sites with ease. Faster and more thorough crawling and  indexing means that more of your content will be placed in the search engine indexes.  Leveraging WordPress' blogging capabilities This capability almost goes without saying, because blogging is the historically  core purpose of WordPress. WordPress has retained many of the features of a pure  blogging platform, such as the presentation of articles in reverse chronological order  as its default setting and built-in RSS feed capabilities. The great power of WordPress  comes into effect when its inherent blogging capabilities are employed within a  commercial site.  [ 34 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding Pages and Posts WordPress publishes two separate classes of documents, namely,  Pages and Posts. Posts are traditional blog entries that are displayed  in reverse chronological order and are assigned to categories and tags.  Pages are static documents, not listed by date, and do not employ  categories or tags. A business' website will typically use WordPress  Pages for static company information, such as a Contact page, About  us page, Home page, and will use Posts for blog entries and updates.  A sound and standard approach to a commercial site on the WordPress platform is  to have the main services pages for a business published on the front page and in the  Pages section of WordPress, while the educational articles, product updates, general  blog posts, and commentary are published to the Posts section. The Posts section  of WordPress is traditionally where blog posts appear. With this dual capability, a  website owner can outpace competitors that aren't employing a blog.  Displaying RSS feeds RSS feeds come standard with all WordPress installations. RSS stands for really simple  syndication, and refers to a family of formatting standards that allow for the timely  publication of freshly-updated web content to other websites and devices. In a practical  sense, the RSS feeds of your site can be utilized by users to follow your content in an  RSS reader such as a Google Reader  now as a Chrome Extension  or an RSS reader app  without necessarily visiting your site. When a user subscribes to your RSS feed, they'll  receive regular updates of all new content you generate. RSS represents another avenue  by which users can remain engaged with you and your content.  You need not do anything to set up your WordPress feed—it's already there.  However, you may wish to take a few steps to ensure that users can find your feed.  You do this by using a link, which in common practice, is represented visually with  the familiar orange RSS icon.  Finding your RSS feed If you need to submit your feed to the search engines or feed engines, you can use  any of the following four standard feed locations. Each one represents a different  feed standard, but they all accomplish the same thing and search engines can read   all of them:  http:  yourDomain.com ?feed=rss  http:  yourDomain.com ?feed=rss2  [ 35 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   http:  yourDomain.com ?feed=rdf  http:  yourDomain.com ?feed=atom  Promoting your RSS feed Many webmasters make the mistake of not promoting their feed. The single best way  to promote your feed is to make sure you have clearly visible RSS icon, with a link to  your feed visible throughout your site. If the RSS feeds fit within your strategy, put  your RSS icon prominently in the header or sidebar. You can also submit your RSS  feed to special search blog-only search engines; we'll learn later how to submit your  blog to blog engines.  Automatically creating descriptive URLs with  WordPress permalinks WordPress seamlessly and automatically handles the creation of URLs through its  permalink feature. A permalink is simply WordPress' way of describing the URL  for a particular page. Because keywords in the URL of a page are a ranking factor, if  you want to rank for WordPress Development then this URL mysite.com wordpress- development will perform better in search than mysite.com index.php?page=5.  WordPress' permalink functionality gives you the descriptive URL strings for search  engines to follow, with no effort at all.  First, you'll need to turn on permalinks within the WordPress dashboard— permalinks are not activated in a default installation. To turn on permalinks, log in  to the dashboard and follow the left side navigation to Settings  Permalinks. At the  Permalink Settings page, in the section titled Common Settings, click on the radio  button for Post name or Custom Structure, and enter  %postname% . This permalink  structure will automatically generate URLs from your Page and Post titles—but  you'll still be able to manually change them if necessary.  Because the titles of your Posts and Pages are relevant to the topic of your content,  the permalinks based on your titles will be relevant as well.  With the adjusted permalink setting, the WordPress page editor will automatically  construct a well-formatted permalink from your Page title. This feature aids in search  rankings. The permalink can be customized if you desire a custom URL.  [ 36 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating reliable and text-based  navigation WordPress automatically generates simple, text-based navigation that works well  for both users and search spiders. Site visitors employ your website's navigation to  browse your site and find content. Search engines use your navigation in a similar  way, with a twist. Search engines follow the links in your navigation to find and  index your pages. In addition, search engines use the text in your navigational links  to reliably determine the topic of the destination page. In other words, the text you  use in your navigation is a search engine ranking factor.  Avoiding image links in navigation It is possible to create a navigation menu that employs images instead  of text. However, when a search engine spider encounters an image link  with no anchor text, the search engine has no text to define that element  for the destination page. So, for search optimization, it's clearly better to  use text links rather than image links in navigation.  Luckily, WordPress generates text-based navigation menus based on your Post and  Page titles. WordPress accomplishes this automatically. For the most part, this is  an effective approach to search optimization. There was some criticism for earlier  versions of WordPress because the navigation menus that WordPress generated  were difficult to customize—they were truly automated, in the sense that they were  very difficult to adjust manually. For example, if you wrote a page with a 30-word  title, WordPress would display the entire 30-word title in the navigation. For some  users, the better approach would be to allow customization of the navigation entries. In response to this limitation, a host of third-party plugins such as Exclude Pages,  and My Page Order emerged to give webmasters more control over menus. With the  release of WordPress 3.0 and continued in WordPress 4.0, a complete menu control  area is now fully integrated into the dashboard. With WordPress 3.0 menus, you can  now control the following:     The title of the Page need not be the text of the navigation link; you can enter      You can create custom links to other websites or pages and include them   custom text for the navigation.  within your navigation.     You can place entire Post categories within your Page navigation. This wasn't   possible with WordPress versions before 3.0.  [ 37 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There is one limitation with WordPress 4.0 menus. The full functionality is available  for Pages, but not for Posts. However, there is a slightly clunky workaround. To  make a post appear in the custom menu, grab the full URL of the post and enter it  into your custom menu as a custom link. That way, you can mix your Posts within  your Page navigation, as well as create custom text for the navigation links.  One warning goes along with using custom menus: when you are  using a custom menu for navigation, new Posts and Pages won't  automatically appear in your custom navigation as they would in  traditional WordPress menus—you need to remember to enable the  new content in the custom menu for the Pages or Posts to appear.  Engaging visitors with built-in  collaboration, contribution, and  community building WordPress is ready-made for collaboration, contribution, and community building— the 3 Cs that can transform a stale, static website into a vibrant web-based community.  Two key collaborative features, User Roles and the Commenting System, keep both  new and returning visitors engaged with your website.  When thinking about search optimization, it is tempting to focus only on the  competitive grind of search ranking positions, and not focus on user retention and  user loyalty. A strong position in search results will certainly bring new customers,  but always think of ways to keep your visitors engaged to your website, and hence to  your products and services. A first-time user of your website is a visitor, but on their  second visit they become a potential customer.  WordPress incorporates several collaborative and community features that can   help you engage your visitors, interact with your customers, and even procure   free content.  [ 38 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Employing user roles to get your team  involved The first feature is User Roles. User Roles are simply the system by which you can  approve new users and set their administrative level. Higher administrative levels  mean that the users have more authority and power on the site. Here is a summary  of the available User Roles in WordPress:  User Role Administrator  Editor  Author  Contributor  Subscriber  Description Full access to all the administration features. By default, one  administrator is created when WordPress is installed, and that  user cannot be deleted. Keep in mind that an Administrator  has the authority to upload and delete plugins and themes. An  inexperienced Administrator can damage a website. Editors can publish pages and modify pages created by others.  Editors do not have access to full administrative functions, so they  cannot change themes or install plugins. Authors can publish and manage their own posts, but cannot  modify posts published by others. Contributors can write and manage posts, but can't publish  content. Subscribers can only manage their profile, but can't publish posts.  With User Roles, you can easily and safely open your website up to all the members  of your organization. More writers mean more content. Collaborative websites grow  larger and quicker with more interesting content.  Improving ranking with user comments Here's where WordPress really starts to leave static websites in the dust: the  commenting system. WordPress' commenting system is simply a feature that let's  any visitor to your website leave comments  good or bad  about your Pages and  Posts. You get the final say on whether a comment gets approved or deleted, and  you can turn commenting on or off for individual Posts Pages.  [ 39 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The commenting system brings your website's visitors into the dialog. You can learn  a lot from the comments that users leave on your website. Some customers might  point out a design flaw in one of your products, or pose a question that benefits all  your visitors.  Page Post comments are great for SEO; your users are now generating content   for you. When your users comment on a page they create new content with   almost no intervention from you, except to click on the Approve button in   the WordPress dashboard.  When the search engines visit your site, they'll find the new comments and index  your new content—the search engines have no idea if you wrote it or not, and they  wouldn't care anyway. When a search engine discovers periodic fresh content on  your website, your site now gets treated differently. As a site with regular new  content, you get more visits from search spiders, faster indexing, and higher ranking.  An extreme example of faster indexing through the creation of fresh content is  Craigslist. Craigslist is the ultimate content site: millions of new, original pages are  created each week. Google knows that Craigslist is constantly updated by its users,  so they send multiple search spiders to Craigslist to constantly index this flood of  new content. That's why while ordinary websites might wait 12 days for a new page  to be indexed by Google, a new page on Craigslist might show up in the Google  index in 15 minutes.  Commenting is a powerful device that you should keep implemented on all  your Posts. Commenting on Pages doesn't always work as well, because Pages  have a different character  your Home page, your Contact Us page—sometimes  commenting on such pages isn't a fit . If you do turn commenting on, be prepared   to moderate some spam comments.  [ 40 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   WordPress' commenting system at work makes good pages into great pages. A  popular blog post that offered a WordPress tutorial generated user comments,  with suggestions for additions to the list. We periodically add suggestions from the  comments to the Post itself. It's a win-win scenario; the Post gets free content from  our visitors, and the visitors feel engaged and empowered. Let's have a look at the  following screenshot:  [ 41 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using update services The final element that WordPress contributes to your SEO efforts is the Update  Services. Update Services are tools you can use to let other people know you've  updated your website. WordPress automatically notifies popular Update Services  that you have published new content on your site by sending an XML-RPC ping  each time you create or update a Page or Post. Then, the Update Services process  your ping and index your new content. Users on sites like Technorati or Weblogs can  discover your new content. This means more traffic for your site.  WordPress is set up by default to ping only Ping-O-Matic's server at http:  rpc. pingomatic.com , but you can manually add other ping services by navigating in  your dashboard to Settings and then Writing, and enter ping services in the field  labeled Update Services.  Understanding what WordPress doesn't  do for your SEO Now, we will turn to some ways in which WordPress does not automatically further  your SEO efforts, and some ways in which it can potentially undermine your efforts.  Note the term automatically—because WordPress can be made to do anything with a  little bit of effort.  The best way to think of where WordPress fits within the universe of the major open  source platforms like Joomla! or Drupal is the following: WordPress is easier to use  and more automated than Joomla! or Drupal, but with that simplicity and automation  comes restrictions in the ease with which it can be customized. Both WordPress'  strengths and its weaknesses as a search platform flow from its simplicity. WordPress  doesn't easily offer a lot of page-by-page customization, either in the body of the  document or in the navigation menus, WordPress generally wants to generate one  style of page and one menu structure for an entire site. Also, in its default setup, it does  generate duplicate content that can confuse search engines. We'll examine each of these  limitations in turn, and discuss a few clever workarounds.  Tackling duplicate content within WordPress In the default setup, WordPress will generate some duplicate content. Duplicate  content within a site undermines SEO efforts because it confuses search engines   which page of the duplicates is the page that should be indexed , and it may make  your site appear low-value to search engines.  [ 42 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Here's how duplicate content is generated in a typical WordPress setup. Say you  or another webmaster creates a Post titled Great Ways to Save Money on Beer,  selects two categories  beer and money  for the Post and one Tag for the Post  saving  money . When the Post is published, WordPress then does the following:  1.  The Post is published as mysite.com great-ways-to-save-money-on-beer. 2.  Category pages are created. An entry for the Post containing its title, a link   to the Post, and a 55-word excerpt  called the excerpt in WordPress parlance   is created on two category pages here at mysite.com category beer and  mysite.com category money.  3.  A Tag page is created. Another duplicate entry of the Post with a title, link,   and 55-word excerpt is created on a Tag page here at mysite.com tags  saving-money. If that wasn't enough repetition, WordPress also creates yearly and monthly  archives that contain another copy of the title, a link to the Post, and the  excerpt. The archives display in this format mysite.com 2010 and mysite. com 2010 07.  4.   We don't want to disable these pages because they help users find content—but we  have to find a way to control duplicate content to maximize our SEO efforts. There  is one other wrinkle at work in this scenario. The 55-word excerpt that WordPress  generates automatically for each Post  unless we create an excerpt manually for each  Post , is generated from the first 55 words of the Post! So, the excerpt itself is a partial  duplicate of the actual content! So, we have two problems:     The excerpt is a partial duplicate of existing content    Multiple archive pages with duplicate content  If this duplicate content isn't controlled, a search engine might index your Tag index  page instead of the content on the Post page itself—not an ideal scenario.  The answer is simple and solves the problem completely: a custom robots.txt  file. Our custom robots.txt file will tell search engines not to index our category  archive pages, our tag archive pages, and year and month archive pages. In the next  chapter, we'll create the ultimate WordPress robots.txt file. With our robots.txt  file, you'll solve these duplicate content issues and secure sensitive areas of your site.  We address the duplicate content in the excerpt by going the extra mile and taking the  time to write excerpts for all Posts. To write an excerpt for a Post, simply scroll down  from the main edit window when composing a Post and find the box titled Excerpt.  [ 43 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Overcoming landing page customization  limitations WordPress does not offer a simple and elegant way to create custom landing pages.  It's helpful to understand the nuts and bolts of how WordPress creates pages. When  a user browses your site, WordPress generates a few different sections to compose  the page. With 99 percent of all WordPress sites, this works as follows: WordPress  generates the header, then the content area  the actual content, such as your blog  post or contact page , followed by the sidebar, and finally the footer.  In some cases, a WordPress site will have two sidebars instead of one, or an  additional element such as a fancy slider under the header, but the method remains  the same. Generally, only the content area changes from page to page, the other  elements remain the same regardless of what page is requested.  Increasingly, with more advanced frameworks and templates that have emerged in  recent years, the WordPress admin area will offer the ability to rearrange and edit  individual sections. Your template or framework may offer increased capabilities.  Essentially, the decision to use an advanced framework for your WordPress site will  boil down to the following: more powerful frameworks deliver more features, but  have a higher learning curve.  WordPress ships with a default template, and this default template changes every  year. For the year 2015, WordPress shipped with the Twenty Fifteen template. It's a  good idea to play with this default template on a sandbox installation  a throw-away,  temporary installation  to learn about how to manage a WordPress installation.  With Joomla!, by comparison, pages are constructed with a far more flexible  and complex system based on modules. This module-based system means that  webmasters can create and utilize different components within modules on different  pages. For example, a Joomla! sidebar can have, say, a newsletter sign up box only  on particular pages—the webmaster designates the pages on which the sidebar will  appear. WordPress' approach is simpler, but less flexible.  WordPress obviously allows you to change the appearance of the content area page- by-page. Page-by-page changes in the other elements of your website, the header,  footer, and sidebar, are possible but require the coding of custom templates, or the  use of an advanced framework or template.  This limitation can limit your ability to easily and quickly create fully customized,  highly graphical landing pages.  [ 44 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding the limitations of   page-by-page navigation In addition, WordPress limits the flexibility with which you can create page-by- page navigation. You may have noticed this effect when browsing WordPress  sites: the navigation menus remain fixed and constant as you browse throughout  the site. Generally, WordPress will call your sidebar when it generates a page.  That sidebar is defined by the choice of sidebar widgets you make, within the  appearance section  from your WordPress dashboard, select Appearance, then  Widgets . Furthermore, the use of the nofollow attribute is generally not possible  with WordPress' dynamically-generated navigation menus. Multiple variations of  sidebars are certainly possible, but require that either custom templates to be coded  or a framework template with drag-and-drop capability be employed. There is no  menu selection that can accomplish this.  There is a hidden benefit to these limitations, you can't mess up what you   can't customize.  Tinkering with a website's navigation can be dangerous:  you are tinkering with the pathways by which search  engines find and assign a relative value to your content.  That said, with experience, customizing your navigation can bring great optimization  benefits. The goal with navigation architecture is to sculpt the flow of PageRank to  increase the flow to your highest value pages, and to restrict the flow of PageRank  to low-value pages like your privacy policy and contact pages. In larger sites, dead  zones can develop, areas where search spiders have difficulty crawling and indexing.  While this doesn't occur often in WordPress sites, customized adjustments in  navigation will generally fix the problem.  Some users will find the restrictions in customization inconvenient, others will   never notice.  [ 45 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary While WordPress does have a handful of limitations, it's generally a superb platform  for search optimization. But that's all it is, a platform. No platform is going to write  good content, contact other webmasters and ask for links, do your keyword research,  or gauge the relative strength of your competitors. But, what WordPress does is  economize the presentation of content so that you can focus on the day-to-day tasks  of building your website into a vibrant destination.  In this chapter, we learned how to plan your website strategy in a manner by which  you can harness the power of the WordPress platform. We learned how to gauge the  search competitiveness of competing websites, and adjust your plan to participate  in the search market. We discovered ways through which you can gain inspiration  for your site and discussed resources where the freshest and most advanced design  ideas are presented.  We discussed WordPress' strengths: its inherently economical architecture, its  blogging capabilities, and its ability to build up large sites quickly. We learned about  RSS feeds and how to harness them for greater visibility. We covered WordPress'  built-in collaborative capabilities.  We also covered a few areas where WordPress won't instinctively assist your   SEO and learned a few workarounds for these limitations. In the next chapter,   we'll dig deeper into the nuts and bolts of technical optimization by looking   at the role of keywords.  [ 46 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Researching and Working  with Keywords  Keywords are the currency of search optimization, and hence the currency of the  new business environment. They are the words and phrases that millions of Internet  users employ to find goods and services they need. They are the signposts that  search engines use to store and retrieve web pages for search users. The search  engines run on words. Success in a search environment depends greatly on sound  keyword research and skills. Capturing search queries for the right phrases can bring  phenomenal success. Likewise, capturing the wrong search terms might yield only  lukewarm success.  Keywords are the foundation upon which the house  your website  is built.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:     We'll begin by building a keyword list based on what you have to offer   consumers. What keywords and keyphrases will purchasers use to identify  your products or services?     We'll examine whether it's wiser to focus on a few high-value terms, or to   build out a broad keyword list and rank for a wide variety of phrases.     We'll look at some keyword qualifiers such as best and expert that can help   boost traffic and edge out competitors.     We'll learn how to group keywords into manageable groups and how to   leverage grouped keywords for maximum SEO benefit.     We'll look at popular keyword tools that can show you what phrases    are being searched in high volumes, and how to spot regional and  seasonally-based trends.     Finally, we'll learn how to expand your keyword empire.  [ 47 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The goal of this chapter is simple: find high-value and high-volume relevant   terms for your business so that you'll ultimately secure that search traffic with  superior rankings.  Building your site's foundation with  keyword research Your keyword strategy is the foundation of everything you'll do in search optimization.  Your page titles, navigation menus, content, even your domain name itself will all be  dictated by your keyword strategy. Just like a building's foundation, if your keyword  strategy is flawed, the house that sits upon the foundation will be flawed.  In the world of Internet search, the term keyword can refer to single words, or word  phrases. Word phrases are also sometimes called keyphrases, keyword strings, or  keyword phrases. In this book, we'll use all these terms interchangeably—regardless  of how many individual words comprise a keyword. When implementing your  keyword strategy, the family of keywords you incorporate into your strategy will  likely be a mix of single terms and multi-word terms. Keep in mind that single word  keyphrases are nearly always more competitive than multiple-word keyphrases— that's because single word searches are generally searched for in higher volumes  than longer strings.  One core principle in keyword strategy is this: when you rank  well for high-volume keywords, you may expect that ranking to  generate a high number of visits to your website. That's not the  whole story, but it's obviously a major part of it.  But will ranking for single word terms bring instant success? Not necessarily, single  word phrases have relevancy problems for nearly all websites. For example, the term  coffee is searched nearly 19,000 times daily throughout the world on Google alone.  But is a web user in London searching for coffee necessarily a perfect customer for a  coffee shop in Los Angeles? Of course not! Keywords must be relevant in order to be  useful to you. Search volume alone is not enough. You need to find the right blend of  high-search volume and relevance to your product or service.  [ 48 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding relevance and the effect  of short tail and long tail keywords It's important to understand the distinction between short tail keywords and long tail  keywords. The difference is simple: a short tail keyword is a short, one or two-word  search phrase. A long tail keyword is a three, four, five-word, or longer keyphrase.  An example of a short tail keyword would be Dallas restaurant, where an example  of a long tail keyword would be Top-rated West Dallas pizza. As you might suspect,  long tail keywords are almost always searched in much lower volumes than their  short tail counterparts. However, long tail keywords possess important and valuable  advantages over short tail keywords, as we will learn.  Examining user intent through keywords To understand the value of long tail keywords, we need to think about how a chosen  keyword reflects the intent, as well as the motivation of a web user. Let us examine  a typical customer awareness cycle. First, a customer becomes aware of a product,  or expresses interest in a product. Next, the customer seeks information about that  product. In the final stages before a purchase decision, a consumer will evaluate  choices and make a buying decision. That typical awareness cycle brings a customer  closer to a purchase decision as they progress.  Ideally, you'll employ keywords that capture a customer when they are closest to a  buying decision. Imagine two potential customers; one who searches for Top-rated  West Dallas pizza and one who searches for Dallas Restaurant. The long tail searcher  has expressed a greater degree of commercial intent and motivation than the short  tail searcher. This user has most likely decided that he or she would like pizza. The  user has also decided that he or she would like to eat in West Dallas, rather than  some other part of the city. Finally, the user has tried to qualify his or her search  even further by searching for Top-rated pizza. This customer is farther along in the  customer awareness purchase cycle, and is overwhelmingly more likely to buy  quality pizza in West Dallas than a person searching simply for Dallas Restaurant.  [ 49 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The graph below illustrates long tail keywords at work; short tail keywords are  searched more often, but long tail keywords enjoy a higher conversion rate:  And so, the power of the long tail search comes into focus. The Internet searcher  in the previous example, is pure gold to a business owner. The long tail search  expresses motivation, intent, and specificity. Sure, the search volumes will be lower,  but it'll be much easier to convert a higher number of long tail search users into  customers. Now, here comes the bonus: most of your competitors are not going to  do the extra work to capture long tail searches. While the competition is focused on  the high-volume terms, you have the opportunity to secure high rankings for high  value, easy-to-convert long tail searchers. Generally, the deeper you go in pursuit of  long tail searches, the less search competition you'll encounter, both in natural search  and pay per click. You'll need to know where to stop though; if you pursue search  phrases that are too rare, you'll have no search traffic at all.  [ 50 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing a powerful long tail search  strategy Here are some tips and rules to follow to develop and maximize the power of long  tail searches:     Geographic locations are great qualifiers that turn general keywords into   long tail searches. All the towns near your business location that fall within  your service area can make great long tail search terms. In Dallas, for  example, smaller communities like Plano and Carrollton can become air  conditioning service Plano, and air conditioning repair Carrollton.     Manufacturer names can make great long tail searches, for example, Volvo   repair Fairfax VA and Honda motorcycle parts Fairfax VA.     Don't get too specific in your long tail strategy or you'll rank for keywords   with no search volume. Monitor your web analytics to see if the search  phrases you are chasing are too esoteric.     Additional qualifiers like Top-rated and Best can help form effective long    tail searches.  Researching keyword search volume with  online keyword tools As we've worked through learning about how to build a keyword strategy, one  central tenet always emerges: the overwhelming importance of keyword search  volume. If keywords are the foundation of your entire web strategy, then keyword  search volume data comprises the bricks that make up that foundation. Find the  high-volume keywords and rank for those keywords and the customers will come.  Keyword research is done primarily with free and paid online tools that maintain  databases of keyword search volume. In the following sections, we'll cover three  popular and effective free tools: Google's search-based keyword tool, Google Trends,  and Google Suggest.  [ 51 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Google's Adwords Keyword Planner The Google Adwords Keyword Planner, formerly the SKtool, is designed to help you  determine the best keywords to target in your Google AdWords campaigns. This is  the grand-daddy of all keyword tools, and should be the place you start. If you only  use one keyword tool, this is it.  You'll need to sign up for a Google Adwords account and create a basic campaign,  before using the tool. Google Adwords is Google's paid advertising system, whereby  business owners can bid to have their ads show up concurrently with search results.  If you aren't ready to start spending big money in Adwords, that's ok, simply enter  a daily budget of one dollar for your initial campaign, and one cent bids on any  keywords you store in the campaign.  To get started, point your browser to https:  adwords.google.com  KeywordPlanner. You'll need to log in to your Google account to use the tool. If the  site you are trying to find keywords for is not being advertised in AdWords, this tool  may not return any results based on your actual website content. You'll be greeted with two choices, Find new keywords and get search volume data  and Plan your budget and get forecasts. Start with the former for a simple and easy- to-understand first look at keyword volumes. With Find new keywords, select Search for new keywords using a phrase, website  or category. Now you are ready to run the tool. You can enter one phrase or several;  the tool will expand your list to related phrases which you can then evaluate. This  screenshot shows where you'll try your first query:  [ 52 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Note that you can set your geographic targeting by selecting the edit icon next to All  locations below the query fields. You can ignore this for now; you want to gather  large swaths of data and then drill down into what's specifically relevant to your  business or goal.  [ 53 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The query results page will show a graph with tabular keyword data below, as  shown in the following screenshot:  Let us break down these results. The graph at the top simply represents changes in  the keyword volume for each of the last 12 months. Pay attention, because the tables  below show average monthly query volume, but seasonal terms spike in particular  times of the year.  Below the graph you'll want to make sure you've selected the Keyword Ideas tab to  get to the display shown above. We entered a single search term, google analytics  training, and we can see in the first table average monthly searches of 4,400 queries.  The graph above shows some monthly variation, but a relatively steady volume. The  second table shows us more—these are queries that Google has suggested as close  variants of the query we entered. Our screenshot only shows the first few entries, but  Google typically replies with dozens. This feature lets us discover new keyphrases.  [ 54 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Understand the purpose for which Google provides this tool to help customers  build keyword lists and ad groups for its Adwords product. So, you will note that  the tool's purpose is you entice you to add keywords to a paid Adwords campaign.  You can simply ignore the Suggested bid and Add to plan features within the tool  and use the Download button to export your keywords to a spreadsheet. Of course,  if you are running an Adwords campaign in parallel to a search strategy, your  keywords data serves both purposes.  Google's dominance in search, and the thoroughness and effectiveness of its  Keyword Planner tool, makes it hard to suggest other tools for basic keyword  research. However, we do want to cover a few specialty search tools that extend   and supplement the Keyword Planner.  Spotting keyword popularity patterns  with Google Trends Google Trends is a useful tool when trying to determine the timing of a marketing  campaign and setting long-range goals. It can also give you a bigger picture than  just looking at the traffic for the most recent month or monthly average, which could  help you avoid seasonal keywords that have had a high traffic volume recently, but  may be getting ready to drop significantly in the near future. You can also avoid  keywords that are fading in popularity over time. You can find the tool at https:   www.google.com trends . Some keywords are obviously seasonal, such as Christmas recipes and Super Bowl party  tips. However, not all seasonal keywords are so obvious. Typing a keyword into  Google Trends allows you to view a graph that shows the spikes in search volume for  a given term over the past ten years. With such a huge amount of data available, it is  easy to see whether the search volume spikes at the same time each year.  [ 55 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let us take a look at a keyword that has both a seasonal variance, as well as a   long-term downward trend in popularity; the keyword is plasma tv. Now, if you  think about it, it's easy to see why this keyword is seasonal. A lot of people formerly  bought these expensive televisions as a Christmas present for the family, so it makes  sense that there is a huge spike in search volume for this keyword at the end of every  year. Let us examine a screenshot of Google Trends for the keyword plasma tv:  Two clear trends emerge. First is the confirmation of the end-of-year spike in  keyword popularity. Second is the waning popularity of this search term. Plasma  TVs, once the rage, were ultimately beaten out in the market by the emergence of  LED TVs. plasma tv is a dying keyword. Would 2016 be a good time to launch a  blog featuring reviews of Plasma TVs based on the data that Google Trends shows?  Probably not. Google Trends is a powerful tool to see seasonal trends and make  measured predictions of the future popularity of keywords.  If you want to narrow down the trends even more, you can filter the results  in Google Trends by geographic region. You can also view data for each year  separately, instead of viewing everything at once. Google Trends also gives links to  the top related news stories and charts the location for each on the graph, so you can  see what effect these events may have had on the search volume.  [ 56 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Keyword discovery with Google Suggest and  Ubersuggest We've all searched using Google, and we have all noticed that Google.com shows  us a waterfall of suggested search terms that attempt to complete our query. This  screenshot shows this popular feature:  Google Suggest is a specific feature of the Google search service, but you'll have to  use it manually as shown above; there is no web-based interface for the service like  with the Keyword Planner tool. The Google Suggest results are delivered in order  of popularity, so it is a valuable tool for keyword discovery. Keyword discovery is  simply the process of expanding your universe of potential keywords.  A more powerful variant of Google Suggest is Ubersuggest, which you'll find at  http:  ubersuggest.org . Ubersuggest simply compiles Google Suggest data  and then delivers it in a web-based format, with a range of additional features.  Ubersuggest makes it faster and easier to leverage to the keyword discovery  potential of Google Suggest. Remember that Ubersuggest is a keyword discovery  tool that displays the relative popularity of terms, but doesn't tell you the exact  numbers of search queries for each term. For search query volume data, you simply  return to Google's Keyword Planner.  [ 57 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Placing your keywords and corresponding search volumes  into a spreadsheet makes it easier to sort keywords  according to which terms garner the most traffic.  Identifying and developing your initial  keyword profile Because keywords play such an important foundational role in the development of  your search strategy, you will obviously want to spend a good deal of thought and  effort developing a sound initial keyword profile. Keep in mind, though, your initial  keyword research is merely a foundation. You'll work and rework your keyword  profile throughout your campaign.  Developing your keyword list has several phases:  1.  Collection: In the initial collection phase, you will simply collect large   numbers of keywords and dump them on to a list.  2.  Analysis: In the analysis phase, you will attach relative weight to terms and   cull undesirable terms. For example, you'll undoubtedly collect terms for  services and goods you don't sell. You'll obviously not want to put effort into  ranking for such terms.  3.  Expansion: The expansion phase will take place after your campaigns have   been running for a while—this phase is a reaction to what you learn from the  performance of your campaign, and from competitors in the marketplace.  Creating your keyword matrix As you progress with your keyword research, you will want to develop a keyword  matrix. A keyword matrix is a simple data set based on all the keywords you think  might have value. Your keyword matrix is your front-line tool in analyzing your  keywords.  Spreadsheet software is particularly well suited to  developing a keyword matrix.  [ 58 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Your keyword matrix should be organized as follows: you should have a row  entry for each potential keyword, with the keyword in the left column. In the next  row, you will record the reported monthly or daily search volume for that specific  keyword. We learned earlier how to pull data on keyword search volumes from the  Google's Keyword Planner tool. In the following column, you will assign a relevance  score to the keyword between 0 and 100. The relevance score is a numerical  measurement of how valuable that keyword phrase will be to your business. We'll  discuss relevance scores in the paragraphs that follow. The following screenshot  shows a simple keyword matrix built around terms related to WordPress SEO books:  Calculating relevance scores for keywords Let us examine how relevance scores are calculated. A high-relevance search term is  a search term for which the commercial intent of the searcher is a sure match for your  products or services. Let us examine the figure above showing a keyword matrix, to  illustrate how to come up with a relevance score. The keyword wordpress seo book is assigned a relevance score of 100. For a writer  of WordPress SEO books, that search phrase is perfectly relevant to the goods  offered. However, the relevance score for wordpress books is 15 percent only. That  is because this key term is much less desirable and only about 15 percent of those  Internet searchers would be potential customers. The other 85 percent are looking  for something else; someone searching for wordpress books might be looking for a  beginning book on WordPress, not necessarily an SEO book. Likewise, an Internet user searching for wordpress seo plugins is not searching for a  book at all, they are obviously looking for a WordPress plugin. That searcher has no  relevance to what we offer, so we assign a relevance score of 0. The relevance score  should reflect your best estimate of what percentage of the search volume represents  actual potential customers.  [ 59 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We then use the relevance score to arrive at a weighted value for a given search  term. The weighted value for a search term is the search volume for a given term  multiplied by the relevance percentage to arrive at an adjusted number of monthly  searches. This adjusted number represents the real value of the search term. And  so, in our example, the search phrase wordpress books has a strong search volume:  720 monthly searches. However, at such a low relevance score of 15 percent  which  might even be generous , this phrase has a weighted value of only 108 searches. On  the other hand, the phrase wordpress seo book is perfectly relevant and yields a  weighted value of 220 searches. And so, you can use a keyword matrix to analyze  your keyword list, to prioritize the truly valuable keywords.  Gathering keywords – thinking about your  customer's  imperfect  intent Now that we have our keyword matrix in place, and an emerging understanding of  how to approach our keyword strategy, we will want to continue to build out our  keyword list.  Collecting keywords is relatively easy, just throw everything into the pot. We'll  continually expand and narrow our keyword list throughout the life of our  campaign. To build out your keyword list, you want to think about the services and  products you offer and think of every possible word and combination of words that  people might use to find what you sell.  It's important to think of not what words you use to describe your product, but what  words your potential customers use.  Your customers might not use the same terms that you use; they might use  derogatory terms, abbreviated terms, misspelled terms, or lingo terms. One  illustrative example is cosmetic surgeon plastic surgeon. Doctors who work in  that field refer to themselves as cosmetic surgeons. The term Plastic surgeon does not  enjoy the same prestige—but in search volume, Plastic surgeon is far more commonly  employed as a search query, and so, the family of phrases including plastic, rather  than cosmetic will be the better performing family of keywords. Even if it's not a term  you would use, if any potential customer would use it, you should put that term on  your keyword matrix.  [ 60 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building keyword lists with common  qualifiers When you build out your keyword list, you should also build variations of the popular  terms with common keyword qualifiers. A keyword qualifier is simply an additional  term, usually an adjective, that the search users employ to further narrow their search.  For example, some Internet users might search for Expert plumbing repair, rather than  Plumbing repair. Qualifiers might not always represent desirable searches; qualifiers  like Free and Research tend to indicate folks looking for a do-it-yourself or free solution  to a problem. The most popular qualifiers generally fall into one of the few categories.  Some common categories and corresponding search qualifiers are the following:     Price qualifiers indicate searchers looking for a low price: cheap, free,   discount, sale, bargain, and so forth. Although you should consider whether  bargain hunters are the customers you want in the first place     Quality Experience qualifiers indicate searchers looking for Best in class   providers. These searchers can make great customers because they might be  prepared to pay a premium: best, expert, experienced, professional, licensed,  bonded, and certified Informational qualifiers might indicate searchers that do not have  commercial intent: research, info, how to, DIY, help, and so on     Time qualifiers indicate searchers looking for businesses open outside of   normal business hours: 24 hour, all night, express, late night, and so on Intent qualifiers are employed by searchers that expressly want to see  commercial sites: buy, shop, store, online, and so on     Category qualifiers could mean any type of product variation: green  that is,   Green furniture , natural, energy-efficient, recycled, eco-friendly, and so on          Employing the human touch in keyword  research With all keyword research, you'll need to apply a Human touch. Keyword research is  not an entire objective undertaken purely based on statistics. You will need to follow  your instincts as you build and hone your keyword list and strategy.  [ 61 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Analyzing customer's search behavior It's important to think about how users search for the products and services that they  seek online. There has been a wealth of research undertaken on the subject, and our  own patterns and techniques as search users can teach us much about how others  use search.  Most of the research on user search patterns leads to a few basic conclusions. First,  new users seeking information online tend to enter either longer search strings or  shorter search strings than experienced users. A new user might enter a query such  as The hospital nearest to Oldham Road in Oklahoma City. If you ever have  the opportunity to observe an inexperienced user make use of a search engine for the  first time, it can be a fascinating exercise. As these new search users become more accustomed to search engines, they learn  how to enter more economical queries—and research indicates quite strongly  that this education happens nearly immediately. Users quickly distill their search  patterns to the shortest possible phrase that will return what they are seeking.  The other mistake that new search users make is that they enter queries that are  too short. An example would be a search user entering the query Pool clean,  when seeking a local pool cleaning company. Such a search is far too broad to  yield relevant local results: it will yield some educational content, a few national  manufacturers of pool cleaning equipment, and some national online pool supply  stores. And so, users very quickly learn that phrases that are too broad will not yield  focused and relevant results. The searcher tries again, this time searching for pool  cleaning in Las Vegas and the search engine returns a list of solely local pool  cleaning companies—exactly what the searcher intended.  We are all users of search, and we have all passed through our informal education  on how to use a search engine. Because all search users become accustomed to  using search engines very quickly, as website owners, we can depend on a certain  reliability in the way search users utilize search strings to find what they seek.  Building keyword lists with location names If you are in a local market catering to a local clientele, then location names are going  to be big money keywords for you. Internet users seeking products and services  near their home or business quickly learn that a search phrase with a location name  returns more relevant results than a search without a location, just like the Dallas  pizza restaurant example earlier.  [ 62 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning how customers engage in local  search Search volume statistics demonstrate very reliable and common search patterns for  locally-based searches. In nearly every niche, from medicine to lawn mowing, the  high volume, big opportunity local search keywords follow the following patterns:     Product service description followed by city name  Dermatologist      City name followed by product service description  Jacksonville   Jacksonville   dermatologist   Sometimes, but not always, searchers include the full state name or state  abbreviation  dermatologist Jacksonville FL . Let's take a look at some   actual search volumes that illustrate these principles.  Daily Search Volumes for Dallas Dermatologists:  Keyword dermatologist Dallas dermatologist in Dallas Texas Dallas dermatologist   Search Volume 390 40 590  The city-product pattern  Dallas dermatologist  enjoys the highest-search volume  followed by the product-city pattern  dermatologist Dallas . Finally, the long tail  pattern enjoys a lesser, but still respectable, amount of traffic. This is a generally  reliable standard for local search queries. Naturally, we will measure specific search  volumes before fully implementing a keyword strategy.  Applying long tail theory to local search Bearing in mind what we have learned about local search usage, a great opportunity  presents itself to the WordPress webmaster: long tail searches in local markets.  This is an underutilized approach that can reward aggressive and diligent website  owners. Experienced webmasters and SEO professionals use this approach and earn  big gains. Here's how to do it.  [ 63 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In both major cities and local markets, there are always surrounding communities  and towns that represent both customer opportunities and keyword opportunities.  In the city of San Diego, for example, there are dozens of surrounding towns  Del  Mar, National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach, Solana Beach, Encinitas, and so  on  as well as neighborhoods  Pacific Beach, Old Town, Mission Bay, Bird Rock, La  Mesa, Clairemont, and many others .  To a business owner, these additional geo-markets are all great keyword  opportunities, especially for WordPress site owners. Long tail theory applies to  smaller communities: because the communities have smaller populations, the search  volumes in those areas will be light. However, the conversion rate in a smaller  community will be higher, because the keyword is more closely focused on the  searcher's location.  And, with WordPress, you can quickly and easily build out extra pages to capture  this extra traffic. Finally, the icing on the cake: most other business owners won't or  don't bother with optimization for smaller communities. Either they are too busy,  too uniformed, or their website platform is too unaccommodating to easily modify  or build out the extra content to capture this low-hanging fruit. If you cover enough  towns and neighborhoods, your ultimate reward can be to completely dominate an  entire region.  There's a wrong way to go about this, however. Some webmasters and less  sophisticated SEO professionals will simply stuff a list of cities into the bottom  of a page. That's wrong for two reasons. First, it's clearly keyword stuffing: the  intentional inclusion of keywords in batches without regard to content, solely for  the purpose of infecting keyword results. Keyword stuffing is against Google's  webmaster guidelines. Second, it's just not effective. You need more than one or  two words at the bottom of a page to rank for anything meaningful. The superior  approach is to build out pages for each geo-market. With this approach, you can  use the town's name in the title tag, body text, and other HTML elements—with this  extra power, you'll rank soundly for searches that include that town name. Also, the  individual pages you create will speak more directly to members of that community,  so you'll out-convert competitors as well.  [ 64 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building local pages the right way You should avoid creating thin content pages to match each local keyword variant.  An example of thin content pages would be if you created 20 content pages for 20  different small towns, but each page was a duplicate of all the others except for the  city name. That technique worked wonders years ago, before Google's duplicate  content capabilities grew more sophisticated. This technique is sometimes referred to  as Mad Libs pages, based on the popular children's fill in the blank books.  There's a great example of the practice of building local pages by a company in Texas  called Dawson Foundation Repair. Dawson has created individual content pages for  about 100 individual cities. Each of these pages performs very well in search results  for queries that include a town name, like New Braunfels Foundation Repair.  If we try that query and find Dawson Foundation Repair in search results, we see  that Dawson's local page for New Braunfels is entirely unique content that is focused  on the proper keyword popularity. Dawson has even gone as far as to discuss the  soil characteristics in each town. Dawson has created unique and meaningful local  pages for many cities and have performed well in search for years.  Following the people, following the money When building your keyword list, you'll always want to return to the question  Who is my customer? If you are a deck builder, pool builder, or plastic surgeon,  your customer is a homeowner  in the case of home services , and a person of  financial means  in the case of home services or plastic surgery . It's obviously  helpful to know where the people with the money live. If the residents of a town or  neighborhood aren't able to afford your product, you'll obviously not want to market  there. Similarly, you'll prefer to put your efforts into high-population areas over  low-population areas. This same approach can apply to other demographics that  might impact your bottom line: Where are the families with children? Where do the senior  citizens live? These inquiries are basic demographic questions that you can use to  focus your keyword strategy. For most, you'll have a sense of your own community: where the population centers  are?, where the wealthier people with disposable income live?. There may be other  variations: areas with new home construction under way are a gold mine for home  services like window blinds, alarm companies, and pool builders.  [ 65 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you don't have a true encyclopedic understanding of the demographics of your  region, or you simply want to deepen your understanding of the local marketplace,  there is a great web-based tool that can help you follow the money. The tool is Webfoot  Maps and can be found at http:  maps.webfoot.com . Webfoot has created a  collection of demographics-based Google Maps mashups that visually represent  demographic data like the population density and household income as an overlay  over a standard Google Map. With this tool, you can zoom into your town and  see where the population centers are, and where the high-income folks are living.  Webfoot Maps are currently only available for North America and Australia. The site  offers a tremendous amount of data and it can be very helpful in crafting a keyword  strategy. The census data upon which the site relies is from 2000, but it will likely  be updated soon when the new 2010 census data becomes available. To use the tool,  browse to http:  maps.webfoot.com  and follow the link for US 2000 Census.  From there, you can select any of the following demographic criteria:     Median Household Income    Population density    Median Owner-occupied home value    Median age    Median home value median income    Percent White    Percent Black    Percent Hispanic    Percent Asian    Percent Native    Percent Female    Percent Male    Percent of owner-occupied housing units    Percent of renter-occupied housing units    Percent of vacant housing units    Average household size    Average family size    Percent with college degree    2008 Unemployment Rate  county     2007 Unemployment Rate  county     Unemployment Rate Change 2008-7  [ 66 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Webfoot Maps present sensible graphical data for each default selection, but you can  adjust the Value parameter to display, for example, you can display only areas with  incomes above $100,000 per year.  Here's how Webfoot's demographic Google Maps mashup works at displaying  household income in the geo-markets including and surrounding Dallas Fort  Worth. Darker areas indicate higher income levels. Areas with higher incomes can  present excellent web marketing opportunities for some businesses, as shown in the  following screenshot:  Tuning and honing your keyword list In the beginning of this chapter, we introduced the three phases of keyword strategy:  collection, analysis, and expansion. We have learned how to gather and collect  keywords, and now we'll move on to the analysis phase: how to tune and hone your  keyword list for maximum effectiveness, how to prioritize keywords, how to group  keywords into families, how to account for seasonal variations in keyword traffic,  and finally how to introduce negative keywords to avoid useless traffic.  [ 67 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Prioritizing keywords Be realistic about the breadth of your keyword profile: if you are just starting out in  a competitive market, you may not realistically rank for all your desired keywords.  Even experienced SEO professionals with tremendous link building power at their  disposal will prioritize certain keywords for an initial launch and then introduce other  keywords and keyword families in phases once rankings have been established.  It makes sense to work in phases, preferably in 90-day increments. Choose keywords  that present a realistic and attainable goal of competitive rankings in three months.  Once you meet your ranking goals for the first set of keywords, move on to the next  set of keywords.  Building first, second, and third tier keywords So, which keywords should you work on first? Generally, your first tier keywords  should get attention first. First tier keywords are your primary, high-volume and  high-relevance terms. First tier keywords are generally more competitive, but they're  likely where you'll get the lion's share of your traffic. For example, if you sell medical  supplies in Chicago, your first tier keywords would include the following:     Medical supplies Chicago    Medical supplier Chicago    Chicago medical supplier    Chicago medical supplies     Wheelchair supply Chicago    Orthopedic supply Chicago    Respiratory products Chicago  Next, you'll work on your second tier keywords. Second tier keywords are lower- volume category-based terms. This family of keywords will be larger than your first  tier keywords, and search competition will be lighter. Some examples  again from  the medical supply niche  of second tier keywords would include:  Finally, you will prioritize your third tier keywords. Your third tier keywords are  your lowest volume: true long tail keywords. Third tier keywords describe specific  products or services, and specific model names and numbers. Again, some keyword  examples would include:     9000 XT wheelchair Chicago    Electric powered wheelchair Chicago    Blood glucose test meter Chicago  [ 68 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Obviously, it makes more sense to endeavor to rank for the first tier keywords  before ranking for more specific and low-volume second and third tier keywords.  Prioritizing high-volume terms first will help bring great numbers of visitors sooner.  There is one important exception to that rule: if your first tier keywords are too  competitive, you may take too long to rank for those terms and you may wish to  consider inverting your plan and prioritizing your second or third tier keywords  first. Your goal is to get traffic quickly when you start up. Starting with lower tier  keywords where the competition is lighter can help bring traffic more quickly.  Accounting for seasonal trends Seasonal trends effect keyword volumes in varying degrees. In some industries, there  is almost no seasonal variation in keyword volume. Examples of such industries  include staple products like groceries, telephone services, family medicine, auto  repair—the things that all folks need pretty much all the time. Then on the other end  of the spectrum are those products that are acutely seasonal. The most pronounced  examples would be Santa dolls around Christmas time, pool building services in  spring and summer, air conditioning repair in summertime in the Southern U.S.,  weight-loss programs just after New Year's and in the spring.  The truth is that nearly all keywords are seasonal to some degree—just perhaps not  enough to worry about. Sure, family medicine business will drop off during summer  while folks are away on vacation. But if you are a family practitioner, small dips in  seasonal volume won't affect your strategy enough to warrant major changes in your  approach. Seasonal variations in keyword volume will matter more to people in truly  seasonally-based industries.  So, how would an air conditioning repair business work around seasonal changes  in keyword traffic for Air conditioning terms? Surely the keyword traffic would drop  off in cold weather  believe me, it does . The answer is to prioritize air conditioning  terms in the spring and summer and then prioritize heating and heating repair terms  in the late summer and fall to capture shifts in seasonal traffic.  Tuning your list – negative keywords Negative keywords are words for which you do not want to capture search traffic.  Put another way, negative keywords are words that when they appear in a search  query, represent an intent that makes the searcher undesirable as a customer. For  example, the term do-it-yourself  DIY  is a term typically employed by ambitious  homeowners who want to find information to fix broken items themselves, rather  than pay a service. Here's another example: if you offer window replacement for  residential homes, you want to avoid traffic for Car window repair. You can use the  negative keywords Auto and Car to avoid those searches.  [ 69 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The well-known SEO speaker Dan Thies once commented, when asked about a  list of effective negative keywords that folks should exclude from their keyword  campaigns, I can give you a list of good negative matches: free. That's the list. That's a  helpful suggestion, but it's not that simple. If you offer free shipping, you'll hardly  want to turn away people looking for diamond rings free shipping. Negative keywords are most important in a pay per click environment where an  irrelevant click might cost $3—the danger of garnering an irrelevant click simply  isn't present in natural search. Adding negative keywords to a Google AdWords  campaign is easy, and can be done in two ways:     You can add a negative keyword as you would with any other keyword—  simply put a negative sign  -  before the negative term when you are  populating your keyword list.     You can also add negative keywords at the campaign level  which will    apply the negative term to all your ad groups , by selecting the campaign,  then selecting the Keywords tab, and scrolling down to the section titled  Negative keywords.  Grouping keywords into families You'll want to group your keywords into families of related terms. There are several  benefits. Your keyword families form the genesis of sections, categories, and pages  on your website. Also, your keyword families can serve as highly organized ad  groups for pay per click marketing.  Let us examine, how to divide keywords into families based around common terms,  and how to implement the families into your keyword strategy. First, group your  keywords around popular terms, as shown in the following section.  Keywords organized into families in the niche of house painting  General terms:     House painting    House painter    Painting company    Painting contractor  [ 70 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Interior painting terms:            Interior painting Interior painter Interior painting company  Exterior painting terms:     Exterior painting    Exterior painter    Exterior painting company  Faux finishing terms:     Faux finishing    Faux painting  The preceding section is hyper-simplified, but illustrates a sensible way to categorize  painting-related keywords. The Interior Painting Terms family is all based around  the term Interior while the Exterior Painting Terms family is based around the term  Exterior. It takes no great leap of logic to figure that it would also be sensible to  structure sections and or pages of your website around these families. For example,  a well-written web page about interior painting services with pictures of interior  painting projects, can serve as a landing page that ranks for  and converts  customers  searching for interior painting services. Conversely, it would be more difficult to  create a page that would rank for two families of terms, both Interior and Exterior  terms. As all the terms in the Interior Painting Terms family contain the term  interior, you need only one destination web page to rank for the entire family of  terms. Naturally, the words Interior painting and Interior painter will be the primary  keywords that you'll use in the core elements of the interior painting landing page.  These families of keywords can also serve as well-organized ad groups in pay per  click campaigns. Both Google and Yahoo's pay per click services utilize a format  where advertisers combine their keywords into groups. When pay per click  keywords are organized into groups, the campaigns are more effective than single- group campaigns. The text ads served by group can be focused more relevantly on  the topic of the group yielding higher click-through rates and higher quality scores.  Then you can employ individual landing pages based on each keyword group,  which will increase conversions over a general page.  [ 71 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finding new keywords You will always want to be alert to the new keyword opportunities. This is the  expansion phase of your keyword development. New products and product model  numbers will become new keywords as they are released to the market. New  technologies create new keyword opportunities at an ever-increasing pace. New laws  create new keyword opportunities as they are passed. Stay on top of these keyword  trends and you'll further edge out your competitors.  Eyeing the competition One way to find new keywords is to keep an eye on your competition. What  keywords are your competitors utilizing for the important pages of their website?  Is your competition advertising new products and services? If so, it may mean that  they've found a micro-niche within their market that you can harness as well.  You can also use one of several keyword spying websites. The website Spyfu   http:  www.spyfu.com  touts itself as a resource that empowers you to spot new  SEM SEO opportunities and outsmart your competitors. That's a fitting description.  Spyfu gathers pay per click data on millions of websites and let's you discover what  keywords your competition is employing in their pay per click campaigns. While  the free version offers a peek, the paid version offers more data and more depth of  features. As an alternative, the service SEMRush offers the same capability. Another  great spying tool is Google Alerts. Google Alerts is a free tool with which you can  monitor the web for interesting new content. Here's how it works: you enter a query  term. When Google discovers new content that includes that query term, you receive  an e-mail. This free service is great for monitoring your competition: simply enter the  name of a competitor's website, and you'll receive an e-mail each time they publish  new content on their website or issue a press release. The keyword tools we've  described earlier in this chapter, Google Suggest and Ubersuggest, both present  variants of keywords when you employ them. Use these tools to continually expand  your keyword lists.  Finding new keywords with Google  AdWords A powerful keyword expansion tool is one that we discussed above: Google  AdWords. Google AdWords, Google's popular pay per click advertising program,  has a supplemental benefit: it's a powerful keyword research tool.  [ 72 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   SEO professionals know that running a pay per click program in the  Google AdWords program can generate two big benefits in the early  stages of an SEO campaign: you'll get AdWords keyword suggestions,  and you'll also supplement your clicks while you are working to rise  up in the natural rankings.  Google AdWords is a prolific storehouse of keyword analytics. Besides the  formidable keyword research capabilities discussed near the start of this chapter,  Google AdWords automatically generates new keyword ideas for you in the  keyword entry panel and in the Opportunities section of the interface. To see suggested keywords in the Adwords keyword entry panel, begin by logging  in and browsing to an active campaign. Again, when using Adwords as a keyword  research tool you'll need an account and at least one active campaign. Select the  Keywords tab at the top of the edit window. Then click the red + Keywords button  at the top of the table that opens up. Then simply add one or more keywords in the  box to the left. In the example below, we've entered a term, retargeting agency.  Google automatically makes keyword suggestions, which can be seen in the box to  the right indicated by the red arrow. As always, you'll need to evaluate whether the  suggestions are appropriate for you business, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 73 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   To see suggested keywords in the Adwords Opportunity too, log in to your  Adwords account and browse to a campaign. You'll need to have an active campaign  covering your principal keywords to see relevant keyword suggestions. Click  Opportunities in the top menu bar. You might see a variety of campaign opportunities such as Raise your budgets and  Use phrase or broad match, but what you are looking for is Add new keywords, as  shown in the following screenshot:  Click the View opportunities button, and you'll see Google's suggested keywords  conveniently organized into keyword families. Click the View button to see the  keywords. While AdWords is focused on encouraging you to increase the scope and  budget of your pay per click campaign, these supplemental keywords can help you  build out your main keyword list as well. From here, you'll apply your relevance  analysis to see if you want to add keywords to your keyword profile, as shown in the  following screenshot:  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to build the foundation of your web empire: your  keyword strategy. We learned how to harness the difference between long tail  and short tail searches. We learned how to research and develop an initial list of  keywords and employ a keyword matrix spreadsheet to begin to fine tune your  keyword list.  We covered the use of several popular and effective keyword-suggestion tools:  Google Suggest, Ubersuggest, and Google AdWords. We learned how to build out  and harness the long tail with effective keyword qualifiers and location names. We  learned how to employ demographic data to further the power and relevance of your  keyword profile.  [ 74 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We learned how to hone and categorize your keyword list into tiers, and how   to effectively prioritize for seasonal changes in search traffic. Finally, we learned  a little bit of competitive espionage: how to monitor your competitors for new  keyword opportunities.  With the tools in this chapter, you will have the ability to compete strongly against  even professional SEO firms. In the next chapter, we'll dig deep into the technical  nuts and bolts of search engine optimization where we'll put your keyword strategy  into effect.  [ 75 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding Technical  Optimization  We now turn to the heart of this book, and the heart of natural search rankings:  technical optimization. Technical optimization provides the nuts and bolts of   on-page optimization: the subtle craft of organizing your content, link structure,   title and headings, meta tags, images, and so on, to achieve high placement for   your pages.  In this chapter, we will cover how to take what we've learned about keyword  research and implement a ranking strategy. We'll build a perfect web page, a web page  where all the elements work together to achieve maximum ranking power. We will  learn how to craft a domain name that is well-poised to rank for primary keywords.  We will examine how to create an effective WordPress permalink structure.  We will dig deep into page titles, title tags, navigation anchor text, and meta tags.  We will learn sound strategies for crafting body content and how to control, analyze,  and tweak keyword density. We will discover some expert techniques for WordPress  theme template optimization.  We will uncover the secrets of a sure-fire robots.txt file to control and harness  WordPress' innate power. Finally, we will turn to two powerful tools that can aid  in spider penetration and help troubleshoot crawling errors: XML sitemaps and the  Google Webmaster Tool.  Remember that on-page optimization is only half the battle or one-third of the battle,  really! Much of the power of ranking comes from link building, which we'll cover  in the later chapters. Don't forget the analogy: on-page optimization is like tuning a  car and getting it ready to race. The fuel that makes the car run at top speed is link  building. If you follow the dictates of this chapter for all your pages, you'll build a  solid foundation upon which your link building efforts will fuel your placement to  new heights.  [ 77 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Choosing a keyword-rich domain name We learned in the last chapter how keywords are the foundation of your optimization  efforts. So, we begin with the keyword matrix we developed in the last chapter and  employ it to map out your on-page strategy.  Almost all websites will rely on primary keywords on core pages, such as the front  page. If your keyword research teaches you that one phrase or a very small group  of related phrases represents your high-volume, high-relevance primary keywords,  then you'll want to consider using those key phrases in a keyword-rich domain  name. For some, this won't be possible or desirable: perhaps the domain name  has already been chosen, or the business' marketing strategy revolves principally  around a customized brand name. However, if you have the opportunity to choose a  keyword-rich domain name, you'll benefit from a little extra power in your ranking  efforts down the road. You may have noticed that often a competitive search market  is populated with websites that have keywords in their domain name. This is  particularly true for results that appear in the Bing search engine. This is no accident:  key terms in the domain name are a ranking factor and experienced webmasters  know it.  Choose your domain name wisely; if you ever need to change your domain name,  it'll take a lot of work and you'll lose both incoming links and existing customers.  Follow the 80 percent rule SEO professionals know that you don't always have—and won't  always need—every SEO element  domain age, keyword-rich domain  name, expert title tags, thousands of inbound links, and so on  to rank  well. When you consider all the elements together that make a site  rank well, you want to make sure you have 80 percent of the elements  present—but don't fret if a few elements are out of your control.  Domain names are certainly an element that search engines consider as a ranking  factor, although the weight that Google applies to domain names has been dialed  back in recent years. Remember a search engine's core purpose: to deliver relevant  search results to a user entering a query. Certainly, a domain name that includes  a few of the searcher's query terms would tend to be relevant for that query. The  weight afforded by search engines to keywords in domain names is moderate. In  competitive markets, a keyword-rich domain name can provide some extra push to  pass tough competitors. This can be frustrating in a market where every conceivable  variant of a domain name has been snatched up.  [ 78 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Also, keep in mind that keyword prominence applies to keywords in domain names.  This means that the first words in a domain name are afforded greater weight by  the search engines than the last words in a domain name. You will also want to  mirror the word order of popular search phrases whenever possible, and keep your  important terms first in the domain name.  To craft a domain name, begin with your primary keywords. We'll use some real  keyword data and search volumes surrounding the key phrase Denver homes as   an example:  Keyword Denver homes for sale Denver homes Denver homes for rent New homes Denver  Monthly Search Volume 1,000 1,000 280 280  The preceding table demonstrates a few important points:     Denver is the first word in both of the highest volume key phrases    Denver appears in all four of the keyword variations    Homes appears in all four of the keyword variations  In this example, the terms new and for rent aren't the valuable terms—unless, of  course, your website is concerned with rental homes and apartments in Denver, in  which case, the Denver homes for rent key phrase is the only relevant one on  which to base your domain name. With Denver in the first position for the majority  of searches, you will want to maintain that word order. You should also consider keyword overlap in crafting domain names. Keyword  overlap exists when one key phrase or keyword is incorporated either partially or  fully within another—and you can use it to your benefit. In our example, Denver  homes is fully overlapping with Denver homes for sale. When you see overlap  like that with a robust search volume for both phrases, the longer key phrase  becomes even more attractive as a primary keyword for your domain name. "New  homes Denver" has only a partial overlap, and even that's a stretch because the word  order is reversed.  [ 79 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   And so, in our example, the path is clear: Denver homes for sale is a highly  desirable high-volume phrase to use as the basis for a domain name. But what  should you do if denverhomesforsale.com is already taken? You have two options:     Buy an existing or dropped domain, play with hyphens    Consider the plural version of key terms or create a clever variation with   extra words  Buying acquiring domain names You can always buy a domain name from its owner or wait for an existing domain to  expire  so-called dropped domains . For dropped domains, there are a host of online  services that, for a fee, will help you navigate the increasingly complex world of  expired domains. This approach will yield some inevitable frustrations: the system is  dominated by experts that have mastered its subtleties. As a newcomer, you'll likely  have to endure a learning curve. Also, an owner of an expired domain is entitled to  a redemption period during which, you'll have to wait if you want to snatch up a  choice domain. For most SEO pros, the extra time and risk isn't worth it—especially  when you can overcome a less-than perfect domain name with sound on-page  optimization and some extra linking power.  You can also buy a domain in the aftermarket from an existing domain owner.  Dangers to watch out for with this approach are that some domain owners make  it impossible to be found, and when you do find them, they have a completely  deluded sense of the domain's value. Services like Sedo.com and Domainbrokers. com maintain ostensibly active listings of domains for sale. Domain registrars like  GoDaddy.com offer domain buying services, where you select a desired domain name  and they attempt to secure it for you.  In the domain resale market, asking prices for domains are typically astronomical.  Overall, the domain resale market is riddled with complexities, dead ends, and  punitive pricing. If you do undertake to purchase a domain, either by resale or  following expiration, be prepared for a hunt. Smart SEO professionals don't overpay  for domains, and they certainly don't endure unreasonable delays to launch their  next project.  [ 80 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Hyphens and extra characters in domain  names It's true, all the easy domain names are taken. However, you still have an  opportunity to fashion a keyword-rich domain name with a little creativity.   All domain names must follow these technical rules:     Domains can include letters  x, y, z     Domains can include numbers  1, 2, 3     Domains can include dashes hyphens and can be repeated in    sequence  -, --, ---      Domains cannot include spaces    Capitalization of letters is ignored    Domains can't begin or end with a dash  Hyphens present a good opportunity. In our example, we might consider checking  for the availability of denver-homes-for-sale.com. This domain keeps the  keywords in order, maintains keyword prominence, and the hyphens have two  benefits: they certainly make the domain easier for humans to read and can help  search engines distinguish the words  that is, Kitchenspot versus Kitchen spot .  The drawback of hyphens—and it is worth consideration—is that hyphenated  domains are awkward and unmemorable and can appear trashy. Visitors are  unlikely to remember your specific combination of words and hyphens. It can also be  inconvenient to express your e-mail address repeatedly as Peter at Denver homes  for sale, dot com, with hyphens between all four words. That said, in a  pure search environment where you are going solely for keyword-based traffic, you  can worry less about memorability. You'll be getting your visitors solely from search  and not requiring repeat visitors.  Hyphenated domains have a fairly deserved reputation as being a bit trashy; many  link farms and thin content sites employ hyphens in their domain names.  A helpful variant of this technique is to simply apply a suffix to the domain, such as  denverhomesforsalenow.com or denverhomesforsale303.com  303 is an area code  in Denver . Get creative: think of a term that adds value to your domain. The terms  express and pros have positive connotations. Express suggests speedy, high-value  service. Pros suggests someone licensed with experience. Find an appropriate suffix  for your domain and you will have a keyword-rich domain without the hassle and  expense of purchasing in the domain aftermarket.  [ 81 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As a final word on domains, make sure you use a reputable domain registrar.   Some disreputable registrars may make it difficult for you to transfer your   domain away later.  Don't park your domains, put up content! Domain registrars like  GoDaddy offer domain parking services. This isn't a service at all— it's a way for GoDaddy to squeeze a few pennies in pay per click ads  out of your domain. The better approach is to put up even just a few  paragraphs on your domain just to get the search engines indexing the  page and building up some site age. Parked domains don't earn site age.  Creating an effective WordPress  permalink structure Our discussion of domain names dovetails nicely into our next topic: permalinks.  Pages created in WordPress do not have filenames as we typically think of them,  but they can have an ostensible filename that works exactly the same way, and that  is a permalink. Because words in the URL string  both domain names and words in  filenames  are ranking factors, we will want to do our best to employ keywords into  our permalinks.  In the default setting, WordPress generates very SEO-unfriendly and unmemorable  URL strings, like this: http:  www.TastyPlacement.com ?p=123. The permalinks  feature converts WordPress Page and Post titles into keyword-rich strings like  http:  www.TastyPlacement.com wordpress-book.  Activating permalinks on your WordPress site takes only a minute. To access the  permalinks menu, log in to your WordPress dashboard and look into the Settings  menu. The screenshot below offers a view of the WordPress permalinks menu,  showing the simple, but effective,  %postname% custom permalink:  [ 82 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   It's worth mentioning that there is very little difference between the last two  selections in the preceding screenshot. The Post name selection will yield the   same permalinks as Custom Structure, with one small difference: the Post name  selection will have a trailing   symbol at the end of each URL permalink. There   is no difference in ranking power between the two.  You have choices with permalinks. The most important rule is simply to use some  form of permalink with WordPress. Never use the default setting, there is simply no  reason to have your Pages and Posts identified by ?p=123. The permalinks menu offers you a few pre-designed options: Default, Day and  name, Month and name, Numeric, a Post name, and Custom structure. For SEO  reasons, the numeric option is really not better than the default setting. The Day and  name and Month and name settings build URL strings with numbers representing  years, months, and days, as the case may be, followed by the web page title  separated with hyphens.  The pre-selection options are curious. What's been absent from the selections is the  simple, effective, and often-employed permalink: the postname—but this was added  with WordPress 4. To employ just the post name, which is the simplest, quickest, and  most SEO friendly, just select Post name for your permalinks.  [ 83 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you insist on displaying URLs without the trailing  , simply enter a Custom  structure as in the preceding illustration. The presence or absence of the trailing    will appear in your final permalinks, the choice is up to you. The Post name  permalink will take your Page or Post titled Best Golf in Texas and make a  permalink http:  yoursite.com best-golf-in-texas . That's going to be a fairly  effective URL string for most purposes. Also, keep this in mind: when you designate  a Post name or custom permalink, you still retain the ability to manually change  the permalink in the edit window. The Post name permalink simply supplies a  convenient initial URL-friendly version of your Post name in an editable box.  Highly customized permalinks If you desire highly-customized permalinks, there are several shortcodes that   you can input into the Custom structure edit window in the permalinks menu.   A complete list of shortcodes for permalinks is as follows:     %year%: This supplies the year that the Page or Post was created in four   digits, that is, 2008.  two digits, that is, 09.     %monthnum%: This supplies the month that the Page or Post was created in      %day%: This supplies the date that the Page or Post was created, that is, 31.    %hour%: This supplies the hour that the Page or Post was created.    %minute%: This supplies the minute that the Page or Post was created.    %second%: This supplies the second that the Page or Post was created.    %postname%: As discussed, this supplies a simplified, URL-friendly  no  spaces, no capital letters, and no prohibited punctuation  version of the  title of the Post or Page. For performance reasons, you must always use  %postname% at the end of your string, and not followed by other shortcodes  like day, month, year, and so on.     %post_id%: This supplies the unique ID number of this Post or Page.    %category%: This supplies the category name for Posts  Pages do not    have categories .     %tag%: This supplies a simplified version of the tag name.    %author%: This supplies a simplified version of the author's name.  [ 84 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   What's the best approach for permalinks? Should you select the year and   month-based permalinks that WordPress offers?  The reason that WordPress offers the date-based options is that it brings a small  performance benefit. If you use the %postname% structure shown above without   any numeric field, such as the year or month or Post ID, it takes more time for  WordPress to distinguish between Post URLs and Page URLs. To compensate,  WordPress stores a lot of extra information in its database. As the page count gets  high, some sites can experience problems. Sites under 1,000 pages need not worry  about this performance issue.  If performance is not a concern for you, you can use the simple %postname% custom  structure shown in the preceding screenshot. If you want peak server performance,  use %post_id% %postname%  or %year% %postname%  as your permalink structure.  And remember, if you change your permalink structure after your site is already  indexed by search engines, the URLs will change, which will force search engines to  re-crawl your entire site. This can be detrimental to the rankings; you need to pick  one permalink structure early in your design and stick with it—this is vital. Never  change the URL structure of a website without consulting a professional. If you  are ever forced to move the location of your Pages or Posts within WordPress, you  can accomplish it with a redirection plugin with either the Redirect plugin or the  Redirection plugin. Both plugins allow you to designate a new location for pages that  you have moved.  Optimizing your Page Post titles and title  tags Now, we turn to a crucial pair of elements: Post Page titles and title tags. We need to  make a distinction between a WordPress Page title and a Page's title tag because in a  default configuration, WordPress generates the title tag automatically from the Post  title, but in an advanced SEO configuration  which we will employ through the use  of plugins , we will generate meta title tags manually.  [ 85 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Page Post title processing in WordPress The WordPress Page Post title is the upper-most element that you create when you  create a Page or Post. WordPress then employs this Post Page title in a few ways,  depending on your setup:     The Post Page title is employed as the anchor text in internal WordPress   navigation menus     The Post Page title serves as both the title, as well as, the anchor text when a   Post is represented on category or archive pages     Depending on the template, the Post Page title will be employed  automatically as an h1 or h2 heading tag on the Post or Page itself    although we'll challenge this standard approach later in this chapter   under Template Theme Optimization with some recommendations  If no SEO plugin is present, the Post Page title will be employed  automatically as the HTML title tag      Looking at the previous list, one might be struck by a few limitations. First, there  is a danger of over-optimization when so many important on-page elements are  in perfect concurrence. The other notable limitation is that what works for anchor  text might not work for a title tag, especially in a long tail environment. Some  webmasters prefer to keep their internal navigation neat and concise, but a longer  title tag can work great to squeeze a few extra keywords in.  [ 86 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The following screenshot shows the Post creation window  the Page creation  window appears exactly the same, but is titled Add New Page  with different   on-page elements identified: Post Page title, body text, as well as meta title tag,   meta description, and meta keywords tag. Note that the WordPress SEO by Yoast  plugin allows inclusion of the title tags and meta tags:  [ 87 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Here's an example. A well-crafted title tag that works wonders in the plastic surgery  market around Atlanta is Plastic Cosmetic Surgery Atlanta Marietta  Georgia GA. This is an actual title tag for a high-ranking page in that market. Yes, it's  awkward and repetitive, but it ranks very well in searches that include either Atlanta  or the surrounding town of Marietta. However, that title tag would be completely  unsuitable as anchor text in a website's internal navigation.  To solve both of these problems with one solution, we'll use the WordPress SEO by  Yoast plugin to give our WordPress site the ability to formulate custom title tags   we cover installation of the WordPress SEO by Yoast in Appendix A, WordPress SEO  Plugins . This plugin is free  though a paid version is available  and is one of the  most popular WordPress plugins of all time. Once installed, we'll create separate  Page Post titles and title tags to maximize our SEO power.  Crafting title tags Title tags are the most powerful of any single on-page ranking factor. Expert care  should be applied to crafting title tags—you will be rewarded with high rankings  and traffic if you do.  To begin crafting these title tags, keep in mind two concepts with which you should  now be familiar: keyword prominence and keyword overlap. Keyword overlap  dictates that you should try to collect a small family of keywords with common  words, and group them together to create title tags that can capture multiple search  key phrases—just as we did a few pages before when discussing how to craft domain  names. Keyword prominence rules dictates that the highest value terms go at the  beginning of our title tag and the lowest value terms go at the end of our title tag.  We also need to consider that the space in the title tags is limited. Search engines  display a page's title tag when that page appears in a search result most of the  time. However, search engines only display a limited number of characters. Google  displays around 50 to 60 characters, including spaces, of a page's title tag depending  on the pixel width of the characters. Bing and Yahoo display roughly the same  number of characters. Now, if you exceed the character count, the search engines  display an ellipsis  …  to indicate that the entire title tag is not displayed.  [ 88 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   From an SEO perspective, this may or may not be ideal. Perhaps  although there is  no evidence for this  Google rewards websites that consistently follow the dictates of  character length in various elements like title tags and meta tags. On the other hand,  an ellipsis tends to suggest there's more here, which might cause just a few more users  to click through. To distill this down to a hard rule, it's best to keep your title tags to  55 characters or less. If you want to see how your proposed title tag will appear on a  search results page, you can try SEO Moz's Title Emulator tool, which you can find  here: https:  moz.com learn seo title-tag.  So, if you exceed the number of characters that the search engines display, viewers  won't see those characters in search results. But there's another question: if you  do exceed the 55 or so characters, will the search engines read and index the extra  characters? In other words, do you earn any ranking power beyond 55 characters?  Various tests have revealed different results, and after much disagreement among  SEO professionals on this point, a fairly conclusive test by the SEO blogger Hugo  Guzman revealed that Google does read and index up to 164 characters of a title tag.  The wise approach, however, may be to keep your title tags within the 55 character  boundary. The first words in a title tag yield so much more ranking weight than the  last words: a long title tag isn't going to deliver much extra power. Also, who's to   say Google won't change its algorithm in the future to exclude or even punish long  title tags?  Creating perfectly-sized title tags To craft perfectly-sized title tags, use any one of dozens of character-counter websites  like lettercount.com  http:  www.lettercount.com   or wordcountertool.com   http:  wordcountertool.com  . These tools are also helpful for crafting meta  tags, twitter posts, and any text snippet where character length is restricted.  Your brand or company name almost never belongs in the first few words of a title  tag if you are trying to rank for keywords. This is a common error that do-it-yourself  webmasters and unskilled web designers make. Sure, you want to rank for your  own business name, but you can achieve that by placing your business name in a  less valuable location than the prime position within the title tag. Just having your  business name in the body text of your pages or in the meta description tag will  cause you to rank for your business name, not to mention the associative power that  a Google Plus business page will generate for your website.  If you absolutely include your business name in the title tag, it belongs at the end,  not at the beginning.  [ 89 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Beginning in 2013, Google became sophisticated enough to edit website title tags  before displaying title tags in its search results. Specifically, Google can detect a  company name at the end of a title tag, and simply reorders the title tag to put  the company name at the beginning of the title tag on its search results page. An  example will illustrate. Our colleagues at a company called The Search Engine Guys  have a title tag that reads, SEO For Lawyers, Full-Service SEO Firm, Attorney  Marketing  The Search Engine Guys. But note in the following screenshot how  the title tag displays in search results:  So, how do we address Google's inclination to redraft title tags? The best approach is  to simply optimize for rankings, and let Google do its work. There is a silver lining to  Google reformulating your title tags: it means that you have a strong association for  your business name with Google, which is a sign that your website has earned some  measure of authority.  With the preceding best practices and guidelines in place, let's look at some real  keyword data and undertake the step-by-step crafting of a sure-fire title tag. The  following table shows keyword data for key phrases related to air conditioning in  Jacksonville, Florida.  Keyword Jacksonville air conditioning Air conditioning service Jacksonville Jacksonville air conditioning contractors Jacksonville air conditioning companies Jacksonville air conditioning repair  Monthly Search Volume 82 33 33 25 25  [ 90 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A few important points are immediately obvious. First, Jacksonville is the first  word in most of the phrases. Because we typically want to mirror the word order  of popular search phrases, we will place Jacksonville as the first word in our  title tag. Another lesson that this keyword data yields is that we are fortunate to  have a great degree of keyword overlap. That means we can rank for several key  phrases by cleverly employing the overlapped portion in our tag. Specifically, the  phrases Jacksonville air conditioning, Jacksonville air conditioning  contractors, Jacksonville air conditioning companies, and Jacksonville  air conditioning repair, all overlap on the phrase Jacksonville air  conditioning. This repeated overlap is a bit of luck—typically, key phrases are not  so conveniently arranged.  Break up title tag elements with special characters to aid readers  and set apart important elements. The  character  called a pipe ,  is well-suited to separating element of title tags like keywords  and your company name. An example would be Utah Ski &  Snowboard Vacations  SkiCenter Travel Agency.  However, the phrase Air conditioning service Jacksonville does not share  the same word order. How do we deal with it? Well, we have such good overlap and  word order with the other four phrases that we don't want to undermine our title  tag by trying to rank for all five phrases with one title tag. We can do two things:  optimize our title tag for the four overlapped phrases and just hope for the best for the  dissimilar fifth phrase, or we could eventually create a separate page with its own title  tag for Air conditioning service Jacksonville. However, we always want to  create our higher value pages first, and move on to lesser search volumes later.  Now that we have our four search phrases and search data, we can proceed through  the exercise. Jacksonville air conditioning has the highest search volume of all  the phrases, and is repeated in all the other phrases, so we place that phrase at the  beginning of our tag. The remaining phrases have differing search volumes ranging  from 33 down to 25 searches per month.  Generally, the high search volumes are the higher value terms, so Jacksonville  air conditioning contractors at 33 searches per month is slightly more valuable  than Jacksonville air conditioning companies and Jacksonville air  conditioning repair, each with 25 searches per month. So, the non-overlapped  word contractor is more valuable than companies or repair. As such, a sensible  title tag would be the following:  [ 91 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Jacksonville Air Conditioning Contractor & Repair Company  In this exercise, we did quite well. We have our high-value terms in the high-value  position, and our lower-value terms in the low-value position. We ended up with 57  characters, which will display perfectly and be read by all major search engines. We  combined the last two words to Repair Company because they were equal in search  volume and Company Repair doesn't read as well. We capitalized the terms so the  title tag looks neat and appealing when displayed on a search results page. One  variation we might have employed would be to drop the term companies to make  room for a brand or company name, but that's optional.  Note that we changed companies to company. Did we dilute our potential to rank  for queries which include the term companies? Not really, one of Google's many  innovations along the way was to deftly hand synonyms. Google generally treats  singular and plural versions of terms equally. The final step is to enter our finely-crafted title tag into the Title edit window in the  WordPress SEO by Yoast section of our Page Post edit page, and WordPress will  display our title tag for users and search engines.  Crafting Page Post titles Crafting Page Post titles closely parallels the process of crafting title tags, and  should be done in conjunction. We need to think a little differently about Page Post  titles because their function and usage differs from title tags:     With Page Post titles, we aren't restricted to 65 69 characters, as we are with   title tags.     Page Post titles are not hidden tags: WordPress uses Page Post titles to  generate internal navigation anchor text, and the titles appear as titles to  content pages. We must, therefore, consider readability.  Internal navigation anchor text is a ranking factor, as is a content page's title. So, we  want to be mindful of crafting keyword-rich, or at least keyword-aware Page Post  titles. To return to the Jacksonville air conditioning example, we do not want  to simply repeat our title tag, Jacksonville Air Conditioning Contractor &  Repair Company. First, we could risk over-optimization if all of our key elements  are perfectly repeated. Second, our title tag, while very effective as a net for high- value search phrases, reads somewhat awkwardly. However, we know our title  tag is keyword-ready, so we just need to fine-tune a bit. To adjust for these two  considerations, we simply need to make our title tag a bit more readable, similar to  Jacksonville A C Contractor and Repair Company.  [ 92 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now our Page Post title reads nicely. We have adopted a synonym, A C, rather  than Air Conditioning. While we may have lost Air Conditioning as a search  term, Google might automatically synonymise these terms—we can certainly just  test to see the effect. Importantly though, we have gained readability and we have  differentiated our Page Post title from our title tag. A little variation between  elements is a good signal to employ as a general rule.  Optimizing meta tags Meta tags, like title tags, are hidden on-page elements—they appear on the search  results pages and in the code of a web page, but otherwise do not display to website  visitors within the body of a web page. Many experts now agree that meta tags are  no longer capable of any effect on search engine rankings, and there is a vibrant  debate on the topic. However, because meta descriptions display on search engine  results pages, they have a supplemental function as a click-through conversion  tool. Recall that search engines only display a certain number of characters, so your  meta description needs to meet certain length requirements. So, the optimum meta  description tag falls within a certain character length.  The screenshot of a Google search results entry shows a well-crafted meta  description tag. The big money keywords are prominent and proximate to the start  of the tag. The tag is readable, persuasive without being trashy, and is perfectly sized  for display on search results pages. As a bonus, the tag includes a phone number;  a phone number in a meta description can sometimes serve to generate inbound  telephone calls without even requiring a visit to your site:  This screenshot from SEOmofo shows a fun and interesting approach to title tags.  Visit http:  www.seomofo.com to see a range of interesting title tag and meta  description experiments:  [ 93 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Configuring WordPress to generate meta  descriptions In the default setup, WordPress does not generate meta descriptions. In some  WordPress templates, however, designers trigger WordPress to generate meta  descriptions from either the Page Post excerpt  but you'll have to remember to  create excerpts for all Posts and Pages  or from the body text of the Post or Page.  Obviously, having no meta description tags for Pages and Posts is not ideal in a  search environment, and generating the tags from body text isn't much better.  So, we again recommend the must-have plugin, WordPress SEO by Yoast. The  following screenshot shows the WordPress SEO plugin in use on a Post edit page.  This plugin adds two handy features: an automatic character counter is displayed  just under the Meta description edit field, and a Snippet Preview that lets you craft  meta descriptions of precise length:  [ 94 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Best practices for meta descriptions The length of meta descriptions, like the length of title tags, is subject to some rules  and best practices based upon how search engines treat them. The first and most  important rule is that search engines will only display a limited number of characters  when displaying meta descriptions in search engine result pages. Google displays  up to roughly 156 characters, including spaces, of a meta description tag. Bing  will display up to 185 characters  in rare cases only, it's better to employ Google's  standard of 156 characters .  Here's a wrinkle: Google will generally display your meta tag in search result  pages, but not always. Sometimes, Google takes it upon itself to generate a custom  description for display in search results.  Manipulating these results reliably is difficult, and probably isn't that worthwhile  anyway. The most reliable rule; however, for how Google generates these custom  descriptions is the following: if the search query is largely composed of terms that  appear solely in page content but not in the meta description tag, then Google will  generate the description from the text it finds in the body of the web page containing  the search query.  The sound approach to meta description tags is to keep them to 156 characters. With  WordPress SEO by Yoast's character counter, you can approach that count with  perfect precision.  Leveraging your meta descriptions to draw  clicks Consider a bit of salesmanship in your meta descriptions. Meta descriptions should  be more than merely repositories for keywords. Because the description tag displays  on search engine result pages, it's your opportunity to persuade viewers to click  through. Also consider that you might be able to get a customer to call your business  without even clicking through your website! In some businesses like locksmithing  and taxicab services, users don't care to price shop or compare services, they just  want someone to come out and help them as soon as possible. In such markets,  consider putting your phone number in the description tag. It's likely that some users  will see your website appear in search results and simply call the phone number  shown in your description tag.  [ 95 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Because you have a little extra room in your description tag, you have an  opportunity to convey some information about your business that will not fit within  a title tag. For example, are you the only licensed contractor in your area? Or, are you  the only local dealer for a particular product or service? Your meta-description will  be displaying along with other organic results, map listings, and paid search ads on  a search engine result page, so it is your chance to distinguish yourself from other  websites and businesses.  Crafting meta descriptions With the preceding best practices in mind, we will begin an exercise in crafting an  effective meta description tag. We will begin with the keywords and title tag for  Jacksonville Air Conditioning that we used in the section above on how to craft  effective title tags.  By the time you create a title tag for a web page, your meta description is 25 percent  complete. Because the keywords that users employ in their queries will tend to draw  clicks, we will always want to have our highest value keywords in the first 70 or  so characters of the tag, and if your keyword research and analysis are sound, the  keyword methodology for creating a meta tag is the same as the methodology for  creating a title tag.  In most cases, then, we can simply begin our meta tag with the title tag we've crafted  for a page.  However, it is generally wise to make a slight variation between the title tag in  the first 65 or 70 characters of the meta description tag: we don't want to risk over- optimization by having the two tags appear exactly the same. One simple solution is  to insert a single word at the beginning of the meta description like best or expert  or 24-hour. If you do follow this idea, make sure the word you add gives some  benefit to the tag, such as bringing in a few extra searches or distinguishing you from  other businesses. Another option is to change up the word order just slightly.  Our well-crafted title tag for Jacksonville Air Conditioning was Jacksonville  Air Conditioning Contractor & Repair Company. We want to alter the word  order slightly and point to the fact that we are licensed. And, assuming we are one  of only two outfits in the area that offer emergency service, we might mention that  in the title tag to increase customer interest. Finally, we'll include a phone number,  and throw in a teaser offer. The resulting title tag is Licensed Jacksonville  air conditioning contractor & repair company. Emergency service,  24-hours. Call 555-1212 for immediate service. Free AC inspection.  [ 96 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   That description measures 153 characters—nearly perfect for displaying in both Google  and Bing  it's better to be a few characters short than a few characters too long . We  have excellent keyword prominence: our valuable keywords are all near the start of the  tag. We've noted that we offer an emergency service, and we've included our phone  number. The last three words are a bit of a teaser meant to encourage click through to  the website. If you follow these principles when you craft your meta description tags  you'll enjoy higher click-through rates from search engine pages.  A dead HTML element – meta keyword  tags Google does not make use of the keyword meta tags in determining web ranking.  Google has stated this publicly on several occasions, case closed!  Despite this clarity  which we do not always get from Google , webmasters and even  SEO bloggers still cling to the outdated concept of keyword meta tags. And you can  still find webmasters mindlessly stuffing hundreds of terms into keyword meta tags  in an effort to improve rankings. It has been over ten years since that technique was  good for even a mild bump in rankings.  True, some smaller search engines still employ the keywords tag in ordering search  results. Notably, Bing publicly acknowledges that it still makes use of keyword meta  tags in ordering search results, but warns that because of historic abuse, they'll not  give keyword tags much weight. Bing's Product Manager, Duane Forrester, put  it this way in a blog post, Getting it right is a nice perk for us, but it won't rock your  world. Abusing meta keywords can hurt you. Clearly, meta keyword tags also have the  potential to trigger penalties and filters if abused. They aren't worth much, so they  aren't worth much of your time.  With the preceding post in mind, we'll fashion a few simple and safe rules for  creating meta keywords tags  you enter meta keywords when creating a Post or Page  in the WordPress SEO by Yoast edit section under the body text edit area :     Because keyword meta tags don't give much ranking power and should be   very limited in number, spend only 15 seconds on them per page     Utilize only keywords related to the topic of the page—never attempt to   extend your ranking to other phrases solely through inclusion in the meta  keywords tag Include between four and ten keywords or key phrases separated by commas        Meta keywords aren't mandatory, if you don't have time, skip them  [ 97 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Optimizing your body content And now we turn to optimization of the body content, the text on the page. One of  the ironies of search engine optimization is that the actual words on the page are  somewhat overshadowed in ranking power by other elements like title tags and  inbound link count. And while you can rank for competitive phrases without the text  on the page  with massive link-building campaigns , body text remains a heavily- weighted component of search rankings.  Along with this topic, we will also dig a bit deeper into the concept of keyword  density. Keyword density refers to the amount of keywords as a percentage of total  words on the page. While keyword density applies to any web page element, it is of  particular importance with respect to body content.  First, what is body content? Body content is the visible part of a web page: the text,  images, and other elements  video, forms, and so on  that appear to viewers within  the four corners of the browser window. This includes text in the form of heading tag  elements.  Best practices for optimizing body content When optimizing body content, you have more freedom than with optimizing title  tags and meta elements. The greatest difference is that body content is not restricted  in length like the meta and title elements. While you won't be punished for lengthy  body content, you'll get more ranking and traffic from 10 individual web pages of  reasonable length than you will from one long page.  Body content should meet standards of minimum length. The de facto standard  for body content length is around 300 words, perhaps 250 words in a pinch. This  is a minimum, and is enough to get a page indexed and ranking, but you'll get  slightly more ranking power as your page length gets up to about 1200 words. As  a maximum length, pages longer than 1500 words should be split into two or more  pages—remember the value of page count to a website's overall authority.  Each page you generate should ideally have a purpose: to rank for a single keyword  or a small group of closely related keywords. If you are going to create a page  without a ranking goal, then just understand it for what it is: a page that is for your  existing readers, but one that isn't going to bring real numbers of new visitors.  Keeping each page focused on a single keyword or keyword group helps you keep  your content focused. If you try to rank for too broad a group of keywords on a  single page, you'll dilute each individual keyword and you won't rank for anything.  [ 98 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   For example, in the preceding example for Jacksonville air conditioning,   it would be appropriate to create a single page to rank for the following group   of keywords:     Jacksonville air conditioning    Jacksonville air conditioning contractors    Jacksonville air conditioning companies    Jacksonville air conditioning repair  These key phrases have overlap, so really the total word count of all the terms in  this family is five words  because air conditioning is for keyword purposes a  single word in this instance . Conversely, if this company wanted to rank for HVAC  repair—that would ideally require a separate page, because the term HVAC has no  overlap with these keywords. Similarly, heating repair would require its own  page—there is too much dissimilarity in the keywords.  Body text, like title and meta tags, must follow rules of  keyword prominence to some degree. So, you'll want to  make sure your keywords appear in the opening paragraph  or paragraphs of the body text.  You might consider applying the bold attribute to the keyword the first time it  appears—applying bold to text can give a little whiff of ranking power for a phrase  or a term.  Another ranking factor that you can employ when creating body text is the use of  keywords in the anchor text of outbound links. Search engines know that a link to  an external site titled dance clothes would tend to indicate that the page is about  dance clothes. This can be easily overdone: too many outbound links tend to send  away your valuable PageRank and can serve as pathways for your users to exit   your site.  Finally, write for search engines—but don't forget to write for people. That's  something which SEO professionals always remind themselves. It's easy to get  caught up in the technicalities of crafting high-ranking pages and forget that  ultimately every page must greet human visitors.  [ 99 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Keyword density in body content Keyword density, the amount by which a phrase is present as a percentage of all the  words on a page, is important for several reasons. First, you need your important  keywords to appear enough times to impact the index that search engines keep of  your page, so that it can impact rankings. However, repeat your keywords too often  and you'll trigger built-in monitoring filters that the search engine employs to sniff  out artificially boosted content.  The general consensus currently is that the sweet spot for keyword density is  between 2 percent and 5 percent. That means that the keyword phrase for which  you are trying to rank should represent between 2 percent and 5 percent of the total  words on the page.  You can test the keyword density of your pages  or those of your competition  with  several free browser plugins. One such plug-in is the SearchStatus plug-in for the  Firefox browser.  Remember that keyword density  like any web page element  can always be tweaked  and retested. If you follow the general guidelines set forth here, you'll do quite well  while steering well clear of any trouble with the search engines. We'll dig deeper into content creation in Chapter 5, Creating Optimized and   Engaging Content.  Optimizing heading tags Heading tags  h1, h2, h3, and so on  are a great opportunity. It's where the expert  optimizers begin to distinguish themselves from the amateurs. Despite the reliability  and soundness of heading tags as tools for optimization, they are often not employed  by webmasters. With optimization akin to a race where you need do only a little bit  more than the competition, sometimes heading tags will provide that little bit more  you need to rise above the fray.  Heading tags were originally intended to operate like newspaper headlines and  subheadings. They were, and are, taxonomical clues to both the topic and structure  of a web page. As such, they are great food for search engines, and great signposts  for you to send to search engines. Curiously, the use of heading tags diminished as  the web grew out of its infancy. The rise of CSS as a web technology near the turn  of the new millennium let web designers format text with such new flexibility and  power that many no longer bothered with the old technology of heading tags  of  course, heading tags can be flexibly styled with CSS just like any other element .  Unsuspecting web clients paid the price in lower rankings.  [ 100 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Crafting heading tags is easy in WordPress: like any word processor, highlight the  text to which you wish to apply the tag, and select the heading level from the text  formatting pull-down. The following screenshot shows the location of the pull-down  menu, indicated by the arrow:  Optimizing WordPress templates Every Page or Post in WordPress should employ a heading 1 tag as the headline of  the article. But to achieve this, you'll need to consider if your WordPress template  generates page titles automatically, and if it does, does it generate heading 1  or heading 2 tags? WordPress templates nearly always generate Page and Post  heading tags automatically based on the Page or Post title. In fact, WordPress' own  template design guide dictates that templates work in this way. This is a simple and  convenient approach, and better for people just starting out.  [ 101 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   But to the skilled optimizer, the more control one can exert over individual web page  elements, the greater flexibility and ranking power one can bring to bear. To achieve  this power and flexibility, you'll want to generate those heading tags manually. Note  that in the previous screenshot, the headline of the page has been entered manually,  and the author has varied the heading from the page title; the template powering this  WordPress site has automatic headings on Posts and Pages disabled.  Here's how to disable automatic page headlines in a WordPress template. The  following code snippet demonstrates the typical WordPress approach to Page and  Post headlines from a template's page.php file:                  The first line grabs the page title and applies h1 markup around it. To disable  automatic headlines, we simply remove the first line  from the opening h1 to closing  h1 tag , leaving the remaining code, which will display only the body text of each Page:              Keep in mind that after you make this change, you'll need to manually enter  headlines for each Page. And, changing the page.php file will only introduce the  changes for the Pages. If you want to make the change for Posts, you'll need to make  the same edit to a second template file, single.php.  Generating page headlines manually Is your WordPress template wasting a heading tag displaying the blog title on   every page rather than being employed specifically to designate the page topic   on each individual page? This practice is far from ideal for SEO purposes, yet   is all too common.  To remedy this, you can adjust the CSS definition for your blog site title in your  template's header.php file. Then follow the tip above to generate your page  headlines manually.  Once you have your approach chosen for h1 tags, what is the best way to   approach them?  [ 102 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Starting with heading 1 tags, remember that search engines follow rules of keyword  prominence for heading tags. So, your h1 element should include your core  keywords in a prominent position  the first few words  of the tag. After all, your h1  element is also the headline of your web page. Again, we'll recommend varying the  elements to avoid over-optimization: your h1 element should be just a bit different  from your title tag, even if just by a word or two.  Keyword density can also be a factor with heading tags: you might want to avoid 100  percent keyword density with your heading elements when considered as a group   that is, your h1 and h2 tags considered together . Each web page you ever generate  should have one, and only one, h1 element.  Now, we will consider h2 elements. As we progress from h1 elements to h2 and  h3 elements, and so on, the ranking weight diminishes. Nevertheless, heading 2  elements are highly recommended. h2 elements can also help you organize your  page content for readers. You should try to include at least three h2 elements on  each web page you create, even if that web page is not lengthy. Use your keywords,  but bring in a healthy amount of additional text, it's alright if your keyword density  drops in your h2 elements. Also, don't keep your keywords in a perfectly prominent  position for all of your heading elements—vary at least one or two of the heading  elements to push your keywords farther back in the title tag.  Let's pull all of this together and take a look at the core heading elements and the  title tag of a finely-crafted web page, all working together in a successful bid to rank  for SEO Austin  and about a dozen variations of that key phrase :  Title h1 element  h2 element h2 element h2 element  h2 element  SEO Austin Texas  Search Engine Optimization  TastyPlacement Austin SEO Firm TastyPlacement: Leaders in Design, Performance, and  Rankings SEO Clients: the Power of a 1 Search Engine Ranking A Typical SEO Program SEO: Let Our Austin-Area Experts Deliver Superior Search Engine  Rankings SEO: Let Our Austin-Area Experts Deliver Superior Search Engine  Rankings  This page has it all: the keywords are prominent, but not mindlessly repeated in  perfect word order. The page covers both "SEO" and "Search engine optimization".  The keyword density is moderate, not aggressive. And, the heading elements   still manage to inject some effective salesmanship, yet remain meaningful and  human-readable.  [ 103 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Improving rankings with optimized  images Optimizing your images can bring ranking and traffic in two ways. First, in the  traditional way, by improving the ranking of the page upon which the image  appears. Second, you can bring visitors who use an image-specific search platform  like Google Images  http:  images.google.com  or Bing Images  http:  bing. com images . Keep in mind that users who visit your site through image search may  not have nearly the same commercial intent as users who visit through a text search  query—unless of course your business is selling images.  Image optimization does not carry much ranking power—it's a minor adjustment  to a web page that delivers a boost, but does not have enough power to rank for  anything competitive on its own. But, to repeat the mantra from Chapter 1, Getting  Started – SEO Basics, when all on-page optimization techniques, even lower-weight  techniques, are all used collectively—the power can be staggering.  Images have several text-based properties that can be harnessed to deliver a slight  boost in ranking power: the filename, the alt tag, and the title. First, create image  filenames that utilize keywords that underscore the theme of your page. However,  it's best to introduce some alternate terms so that you aren't mindlessly repeating  your title tags. For example, if you are competing for the key phrase Fashion Blog,  then you might name an image fashion-blog-style.jpg.  The alt tag is intended to provide a text-based description of the image, if for some  reason the image is not available. The alt tag serves a secondary purpose as an  accessibility feature: special screen-reading web browsers used by sight-impaired  folks employ the alt tag to describe the image. Entering alt tags in WordPress is a  breeze; the image upload wizard presents a blank alt tag field for you when you  upload an image into the media manager. It's impossible to upload an image and  miss this feature.  The third text property that you can apply to images is the image title. The image  title's purpose is to display a small mouse-over information box with the text of  the image. You enter image titles in WordPress just as you do with image alt tags,  immediately following upload with the media manager wizard.  Another factor in image optimization is keyword proximity. Keyword proximity  refers to the distance in characters or words between two website elements. So, if  an image is placed very near a particular keyword phrase on a web page, it tends to  indicate that the keyword phrases are the subject of the image. This factor will tend  to help the image rank in specialized image search engines, but won't significantly  boost your page ranking.  [ 104 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Inserting images and optimizing image  properties in WordPress To insert an image into WordPress, you'll naturally need to be logged in and  working on a Page or Post. When you have the Post Page edit window open, place  the cursor where you want your image to appear in the document. Then, click the  Add Media button that appears at the top of the edit window, indicated by a box in  the following screenshot:  Next, you will see that once you click the graphic icon for image uploads indicated  in the preceding picture , the Insert Media dialog box pops up. You can upload a  picture from your computer  default , or by clicking the Media Library tab you can  link to a picture already uploaded to your Media Library.  [ 105 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you are uploading a file, you can now drag files into the upload window or click  the Select Files button. Keep in mind that you can upload multiple files at once—a  handy feature introduced recently to WordPress. Simply browse to where the picture  is on your computer just like you do when attaching a file to an e-mail. Once you  have the file selected, hit the Open button. Don't close this window yet—you will  enter your title and alt tag parameters in the next step. Once you have hit the Upload  button, your image will upload  your image is now stored by WordPress on your  web server web hosting , the Add an Image dialog window changes dynamically   to show you the image properties window. Here, we'll optimize our image for   search engines. The following screenshot shows the last step of the image upload wizard: the Insert  Media window, formerly the Image Properties window before WordPress 4.0. The  title field fills automatically based on the filename. The alternate text field  Alt Text   is blank by default, and is highlighted:  The WordPress insert media window, shown in the previous screenshot, lets us  control several properties for the image in one location, including the title and alt  tags for an image.  [ 106 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Title field is the image title. Curiously, WordPress auto-fills this field based on  the filename, but strips out the file extension. You can see this effect at work in the  previous screenshot; 4904_4_8.png generates an image title 4904_04_8. The title  property can include spaces, so it's a good practice to clean up the auto-generated title  by capitalizing the first letter of the words and replacing the hyphens with spaces. The next field is the alternate text, the Alt Text. This field is blank by default. In our  previous example, we've varied the Alt Text so that it didn't repeat the filename  and or page title letter by letter. Varying the Alt Text is easy, and can actually  identify the image with more precision. By including the word plaid in the Alt Text,  we might be very likely to rank for the long tail phrase android wallpaper plaid. The Caption field allows you to insert a caption below the image. This can come in  handy if you are trying to harness keyword proximity in order to help your image  rank in image search engines like Google Images. Generally though, captions will be  displayed on the page under the image, depending on your template, so you might  not like the appearance.  Setting image alignment and link settings The next section in the Insert Media window is the Attachment Display Settings  section, where you'll enter image alignment, where the image links to, and the   image size. The Alignment parameter lets you align the image to left, right, center, or none    text will not wrap for most templates —you simply select the parameter from   the drop-down. The next field is the Link To field. This selection box fills by default to the link  location of the image file. If this box contains a URL  by default, WordPress will  auto-fill this field with the filename and location of the image , then the image will  be a clickable link in your post. Beware of this setting, because for some templates,  a user clicking on the image will simply be taken to a page with the image itself,  but no text that may not be ideal. If you set this selection to None  WordPress will  remember this setting thereafter  then your image will not be a clickable link. In  most cases, you do not want your images to be clickable links unless you've set up  a proper gallery, so if your template is prepared to present images gracefully, you  might be wise to set the link parameter to None. The last parameter is Size—here you simply select the size, in pixels, for which you  want the image to appear. You'll be presented with several sizes: your original size,  and a variety of smaller images that WordPress generates on upload.  [ 107 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The last step, once your parameters are set, is simply to hit the Insert into Post Insert  into Page button—your image will be inserted into the post in the position where  your cursor was when you uploaded your image. If you have made a mistake, simply  highlight the image, hit the Delete key on your keyboard to remove it, and start over.  Making speedy edits to image properties You can make changes to image settings on existing posts. To bring up the edit  window to make changes to image properties, click on an image in the Page Post  edit window and an edit bar will appear. Click the pencil icon and you'll pull up an  edit screen, where you can adjust the image alignment, link settings, alt text attribute,  and more.  Let's cover quickly how to make changes to your image properties later. This could  be helpful for tweaking alt text and title to squeeze out a few extra ranking positions.  WordPress is pretty well set up to make edits to the way your image displays. The  preceding screenshot illustrates how to make edits to image properties.  Manipulating image sizes to speed up website  load times Recall that a website's loading time impacts both the user experience and the ranking  position—Google has confirmed its interest in fast-loading pages in several public  statements. Search engines want sites that they recommend to users to yield a good  experience. Websites that are heavy on the use of images can tend to be slower to  load; images are bulky in size compared to text.  You want to make sure your images load quickly. So, the smaller you can make  your image sizes, the faster they will load. Here are a few simple rules—really, the  only rules you need to know that will help you minimize image sizes and thereby  minimize loading times:     BMP files have no place in web design. The files are large and can't    be compressed.     GIF files are most appropriate when large swaths of solid colors are used.  GIF files reduce their file size by limiting the number of colors that display  within the file. As such, they are ideal for images with fewer individual  colors  not ideal for photographs, which can have thousands of colors .  [ 108 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       JPG files are versatile for photographs. JPG files can be made quite lean by  adjusting their quality compression property. Be careful not to compress the  files too much, as JPG files employ a glossy compression—the quality of the  image drops as the files are compressed to a greater degree. JPG files are the  best choice for when you must use a very large image because JPG files are  capable of tremendous amounts of compression.     PNG files are ideal for both solid colors and photographs. They display a   better image quality than JPG files. Older Microsoft browsers do not display  the transparent layer in PNG files. PNG files are a good choice for everyday  use, but cannot be compressed to quite the same degree as JPG files.  To manipulate images and make full use of available compression, you'll want to use  a good image editor as part of your webmaster toolbox. Adobe's PhotoShop software  is the de facto standard, but the open source alternative, Gimp, offers nearly all the  same features.  The ultimate WordPress robots.txt file We learned in Chapter 2, Customizing WordPress for SEO, that WordPress generates  archive, tag, comment, and category pages that raise duplicate content issues. We  can signal to search engines to ignore these duplicate content pages with a robots. txt file. In this section, we'll kill a few birds with one ultimate robots.txt file. We'll  tell search engines to ignore our duplicated pages. We'll go further: we'll instruct  search engines not to index our admin area and not to index non-essential folders on  our server. As an option, we can also ask bad bots not to index any pages on our site,  though they tend to usually do as they wish.  Before we customize our robots.txt file, bear in mind that the WordPress SEO by  Yoast plugin can help us accomplish the same goal, but not as reliably. Furthermore,  robots.txt is very handy for all sorts of purposes, so it's a great idea to know how  to leverage it.  You can create a robots.txt file in any text editor. Place the file in the root  directory folder of your website  not the WordPress template folder  and the search  engines will find it automatically because search engine bots are programmed to look  for the file.  [ 109 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The following robots.txt is quite simple, but can accomplish much in a few lines:  User-agent: *  Disallow:  cgi-bin Disallow:  wp-admin Disallow:  wp-includes Disallow:  wp-content plugins Disallow:  wp-content cache Disallow:  wp-content themes Disallow:  trackback Disallow:  comments Disallow:  category * * Disallow:  tag  Disallow: * trackback Disallow: * comments  Disallow:  2006  Disallow:  2007  Disallow:  2008  Disallow:  2009  Disallow:  2010  Disallow:  2011   User-agent: SiteSnagger Disallow:   User-agent: WebStripper Disallow:    Line one, User-agent: *, means that that this robots.txt file is to apply to any and  all spiders and bots. The next twelve lines all begin with Disallow. The Disallow  directive simply means don't index this location. The first Disallow directive tells  spiders not to index our  cgi-bin folder or its contents. The next five Disallow  directives tell spiders to stay out of our WordPress admin area. The last six Disallow  directives cure the duplicate content generated through trackbacks and comments  and category pages.  We can also disable indexing of historical archive pages by adding a few more lines,  one for each year of archives:  We can also direct e-mail harvesting programs, link exchanges schemes, worthless  search engines, and other undesirable website visitors not to index our site:  [ 110 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The lines request the named bots not to index any pages on your site  although  unfriendly bots will often simply ignore your directives . You can create new entries  if you know the name of the user agent that you wish to disallow. SiteSnagger and  WebStripper are both services that crawl and copy the entire website so that their  users can view them offline. These bots are very unpopular with webmasters because  they crawl thoroughly, aggressively, and without pausing, increasing the burden on  web servers and diminishing performance for legitimate users.  Fighting bad bots with help from Wikipedia Check out Wikipedia's robots.txt file for an example of a complex, educational,  and entertaining use of the tool. Dozens of bad bots are restricted by the file, with  some illustrative commentary. You can find it at https:  en.wikipedia.org  robots.txt.  Optimizing with the XML Sitemaps plugin  for WordPress A sitemap is a page on your website that lists all of the pages on the site, usually in a  hierarchical fashion. Having a sitemap on your website makes it easier for the major  search engines to find all the pages in your site. An XML sitemap is a sitemap that is  generated using the XML coding language. The XML Sitemaps plugin for WordPress  allows you to easily add an XML sitemap to your WordPress site.  The XML Sitemaps plugin for WordPress was developed by Semiologic, and can  be downloaded for free from their website at http:  www.semiologic.com  software xml-sitemaps .  Once you have downloaded the plugin file, you install it just as you would with any  other WordPress plugin. First, sign in to the admin area of your site and then click  on Add New under Plugins on the left navigation in your dashboard. On the next  page, click on Upload. It is at the top of the page under the header. Next, browse to  where you saved the plugin file and click on Install. The XML Sitemaps plugin will be  installed automatically. Once it is installed, click on Activate to start using the plugin. As soon as you activate the XML Sitemaps plugin for WordPress, it will start  generating an XML sitemap. If your site is large, this could take awhile. Once your  sitemap is ready, you will be able to view it by visiting your URL, http:  www. example.com sitemap.xml, where www.example.com is replaced by your own  domain name.  [ 111 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   It is not absolutely necessary to submit your sitemap to Google. However, using  Google's Webmaster Tools to submit your sitemap can help the search engine find it  more quickly. If your site is new and has not yet been indexed, submitting an XML  sitemap can be especially useful because it may take some time for Google to find the  site on its own: you'll almost certainly get your site indexed more quickly. Read the  next section for instructions on how to get set up with Google Webmaster Tools.  In addition to Google, other search engines will also read the information in your  XML sitemap. All of the major search engines, including Bing, Yahoo!, and Ask. com make use of these files. The sitemap lists every page on your website so that no  pages are inadvertently missed when your site is crawled. The search engines do  not guarantee that every page listed on your sitemap will be crawled, but having  a sitemap does ensure that the search engines can find all of the pages. If you have  pages that are not linked from other pages on your site, they may be missed when  the search engines crawl your website. Having all of your site's pages listed on your  sitemap prevents that from happening.  If you make changes to your website after creating your sitemap with the XML  Sitemaps plugin for WordPress, the plugin will automatically update your sitemap  and notify Google's update service of the changes—another great benefit! Bing and  Yahoo! will also be notified of any changes automatically, so you don't need to worry  about pinging the search engines' update services.  When you use the XML Sitemaps plugin for WordPress to add an XML sitemap to  your site, you increase your chances of getting all of the pages of your site crawled  and indexed in the major search engines, even if they lacked the proper internal  linking structure and backlinks to be noticed without the sitemap. These pages  probably won't be ranked for anything other than long tail keywords, unless you do  something about the linking issues, but it is possible to get quite a bit of traffic from  long tail keywords.  Using an XML sitemap is almost certain to increase your website's traffic, which is  likely to result in additional revenue, either from advertising or sales. The best part  about using the XML Sitemaps plugin to create your sitemap file is that once you  have installed the plugin and submitted your sitemap to Google, you are done! You  never need to think about it again because everything is done for you automatically.  [ 112 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   SEO power tool – Google Webmasters An indispensable tool in your SEO arsenal is Google Webmasters  formerly Google  Webmaster Central, and currently in transition to be renamed Google Search  Console . Google Webmasters gives you valuable information that can help you  improve your website and your search engine rankings. It is also widely believed,  though hard to prove, that simply registering your site with Google Webmasters  serves as a trust factor that can bring additional authority to your site and improve  rankings. You can use this tool to find out how often your site appears in Google's  search results and for which search terms, and to upload a sitemap to ensure that  Google can find all of the pages in your website and get information about any errors  Google may have experienced while trying to crawl your site.  To sign up for Google Webmasters, point to http:  google.com webmasters and  log in using the sign-in information for your Google account. If you don't have a  Google account, you'll need to create one first. You can do that easily by signing up  for Gmail or any other Google service.  When you first log into Google Webmasters, you'll be taken to the home page, where  you can click on Add a site to add your website to your account. Each time you add  a new website, you will be taken to a verification page. You will have to complete the  verification process to prove to Google that you are the owner of the site.  There are four ways to verify your website. The first option is to log in to your  account with your domain registrar and add a DNS entry to the domain. The DNS  information you need to add is provided by Google. The second option is to add  a META tag containing your Google site verification code to your home page. The  third option is to download an HTML file from Google Webmaster Tools and upload  it to the main directory of your site. The fourth option is to link Google Webmaster  Tools with your Google Analytics account. Instructions are provided to help you  complete whichever option you choose.  Optimizing your site with Google Webmasters We've discussed XML sitemaps in the prior section, but there are other tools  available through Google Webmasters as well. There are a lot of very advanced  features in Google Webmasters, we'll cover the simpler tools here.  One of the most valuable is the Search Analytics feature. This feature tells you the  search terms for which your website has appeared in Google's search results. It also  tells you how many times your site was listed for each search time and how many  times a visitor clicked on to your site for each of the search terms. To see Search  Analytics for your site, browse to Search Traffic and then click on Search Analytics.  [ 113 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This information is extremely helpful because if you are already getting traffic for  a specific search term, it may not be that difficult to get your website listed higher  in the search results, so you get an even bigger share of the traffic. For example, if  your site is showing up in the search results for tiny blue widgets, you can try  searching for that phrase in Google to see what your site's rank is. If you are 12  in the listings, there is room for improvement. By adding more backlinks with the  search phrase as anchor text, and modifying your web page if necessary to target it  more specifically toward tiny blue widgets, you may be able to get your website  onto the first page of Google or maybe even into the top few results. This will  increase your traffic from that search term significantly.  Google Webmasters will also show you hyperlinks coming to your site from other  sites. The list contains the links that are discovered by the Googlebot while it crawls  the Internet. This tool may not show every link to your website, but it does show  most of them. Some links, such as links to a page that no longer exists, will not  appear in the list. You can see the list by navigating to Search Traffic on the left  navigation bar and then Links to Your Site. The crawl errors section of the dashboard lists any errors that the Googlebot has  encountered while attempting to crawl your site. Navigate to Crawl, and then Crawl  Errors and Crawl Stats. By checking these errors, you can find problems such as  URLs that cannot be crawled because of restrictions in the robots.txt file. This is  also where Google will tell you about any page not found errors, timeout errors, or  other errors that kept it from crawling the pages on your website.  Another important area is the Content Keywords area of Google Webmasters.  Navigate to Google Index and then Content Keywords. Here, you will find a list of  the keywords Google has determined to be most relevant to your website. Reviewing  this list will give you an idea of how well you are targeting the content of your web  pages to the keywords you're trying to rank for. If you don't see your keywords  on the list, you'll need to take a look at your content and reconsider your content  strategy. Also be on the lookout for undesirable keywords in this list. If you see  terms like Viagra showing up on your children's clothing website, there's a good  chance that your site has been hacked and you'll need to do something about it. The Messages section is pretty self-explanatory. This is where Google sends alerts  related to your account. You can submit your XML sitemap to Google Webmasters by navigating to Crawl,  and then Sitemaps. After you've submitted your sitemap, Google will display  statistics related to your sitemap.  [ 114 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Another important section is the site configuration section, which you'll access by  clicking the gear icon in the upper right of the window. Start with Site Settings.  Here, you can set a preferred domain for your website. By doing this, you let Google  know whether you want your site to be displayed in the search engine results as  www.domain.com or domain.com. This helps keep the pages of your website from  being duplicated in the search engine results. In order to set this feature, you must  have your website added to Google Webmaster Tools twice, once with the www and  once without. If you have validated both versions, you will be able to specify which  one you prefer.  As you can see, Google Webmaster Tools contains several tools that can help you  diagnose problems and improve the ranking of your website. Take some time to  become familiar with these tools and learn how to use the suggestions provided by  Google to get your site ranked higher, and increase your traffic.  Summary We covered a wide range of technical optimization topics in this chapter. Hopefully,  we've illuminated some of the mystery of search optimization and rankings. We  have covered a lot of material, and many of these topics are certainly worthy of  further study.  We began by learning how to craft a keyword-rich domain name without resorting  to the corrupt and expensive secondary market for domain names. We learned how  to manipulate WordPress' permalink structure for maximum benefit.  We dug deep into page titles, title tags, navigation anchor text, and meta tags.  We learned how to apply sound methodologies of keyword density to our body  copy. We also learned some advanced techniques to modify WordPress themes to  deliver even greater SEO power. We built a bullet-proof robots.txt file to control  WordPress' pesky duplicate pages and learned how to employ both the Google  Webmaster Tool and XML sitemaps, to increase spider penetration on your site.  In the next chapter, we'll learn how to craft expertly drafted and engaging   web content.  [ 115 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Creating Optimized and  Engaging Content  With this chapter, we begin to fuse our knowledge of search technology,  optimization, and keywords together, to create optimized and engaging web  content—the words on the page. Note the term engaging. We have to give greater  credence to our human visitors, rather than simply following the rules imposed by  search engine algorithms. We don't just want readers, we want engaged readers. We  don't want customers, we want engaged customers. We will be writing optimized  content, but we will focus on the craft and creative practice of writing itself.  In this chapter, we will focus on the following:     How to better engage visitors with your content    How to write effective titles and headlines—how to grab the reader's      How to use WordPress' built-in tag tool to make it easier for users to find    attention from the start  our content     How to create keyword-rich content and how to write with a specific   keyword density, as well as when keywords can be taken too far     How to write for our audience and craft your content to speak to them directly    We'll discover some techniques to develop a personal writing style    How to harness WordPress' category taxonomy and hierarchy to organize   our content  Some resources and ideas that can help you hire out your writing jobs.  [ 117 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Engaging visitors with your content Your web content is your front line. Once you have successfully penetrated the  search engine and earned placement for your website, then you must engage your  visitors with meaningful content. This is true even for a nuts-and-bolts small-business  website with a purely commercial message. Customers are engaged with your website  when they either have a reason to act  to make a purchase or pursue steps toward a  purchase , or have a reason to return to your site. This task will vary greatly depending  on the type of website you offer, and hence, can mean many different things.  The following screenshot shows an opportunity missed: a website with zero-visitor  engagement. This single-page website is little more than a business card: a half-page  logo, a few phone numbers, and a nonsensical theme:  Engaging your visitors can mean many things. It can mean giving them content  that they care about or need. Are your visitors tech-savvy entrepreneurs looking  for tips and tricks to use with cutting-edge software? If so, then give them valuable  and original tutorials, and they'll return in droves. Are your visitors seeking the  latest gossip on movie stars? Give them fresh scoops and valuable insights on public  figures, that your readers care about.  [ 118 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, if you are in the content game already, you probably already know how  to give your readers what they are looking for. When you have the content they  want, they are likely to return. That is called engaging your readers! What about a  purely commercial environment? If you are a plumber, how do you engage your  website visitors? First of all, any website can engage visitors. If you are a plumber,  you'll return to the same question—what do your visitors care about? Well, if your  website visitor has a leaky faucet, they probably care about getting someone out to  fix it quickly! It's that simple. This can mean many things. First, don't just display  a contact phone number at the bottom of the page. Place your contact number  prominently and invite action, For 24-hour express service, call....  In a commercial environment, your contact information is an important visual  element on your website. It should be present, and in most of the cases, it should be  featured prominently.  You can further engage your visitors with trust elements. Trust elements are  elements on a website, that send a message of confidence and trust to visitors. Such  factors might include a Better Business Bureau  BBB  logo, a guarantee seal, or a  personal photo but you need to be careful never to clutter a site.  In the following example, a regional pest control company has included a range of  certifications and awards, and a BBB logo:  [ 119 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Note also, that the trust logos are not in color—this is by design.  Trust logos can clutter a site, displaying them in greyscale  is an expert way of including them in a design without  making them distracting.  See the example website in the next screenshot. Even in the ho-hum world of  plumbing, this company has expertly managed to create persuasive, compelling,   and engaging content. There are great lessons here for all business owners: a clear  and prominent phone number, an invitation to call for emergency repair, and a  discount coupon to entice immediate user engagement. They have even personalized  the employees and the tone—casual and almost whimsical creates a relaxed and  inviting atmosphere.  You can even engage your visitors with temporary coupons that offer savings for a  limited time. Savings are always big motivators for consumers. When the savings are  temporary, that will tend to cause visitors to act more quickly.  [ 120 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Thinking like a television chef Another way to engage your visitors is with rich content—how-to's, blog posts,  educational content, and free articles. Sure, once in a while a free article might  educate a person to undertake personally, what they might have hired you to do, but  don't think of it as a lost customer. Think of it as a positive strategy, that increases  the size and ranking power of your entire site. Furthermore, you'll establish thought  leadership in your business niche—you'll become the expert that customers seek  out. This principle is best expressed by television chefs. Mario Batali, the popular  television chef, became a household name by sharing his skills with the television  viewing public.  Writing effective titles and headlines When writing for search engine optimization, the title is one of the most important  elements of your copy. Titles may not be long, but they have two very important  jobs to do. The first thing a good title does is tell the search engines what your article  is about. This helps ensure that your page will be listed in the search engine results  when someone tries to find the information contained in your article.  For example, let us say you are trying to sell border collie puppies. You have a page  on your website informing the reader about the puppies you have for sale, but the  title of this page is Border Collie Puppies. That might seem like a great title, but it's not  specific enough. People who are searching for border collie puppies online could  be looking for information about caring for or training those puppies. On the other  hand, when someone searches Border Collie Puppies for Sale, your content is exactly  what they're looking for, but your title does not match. In this case, the search engine  may not display your site at the top of the results because it doesn't realize what a  good match your page is for the search phrase.  In addition to containing information that will help the search engines correctly  place your web pages in its index, the title has another important role. It must entice  people to click on the link to read your article. A good title has to grab a reader's  attention and make them want to know more. There's a pretty good chance that there  is more than one breeder selling border collie puppies. Your title is competing for  attention among all of the other titles on the front page of the search results.  [ 121 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Unlike magazine or newspaper articles, which often use catchy or clever titles to  pique a reader's interest, Internet titles must be clear and easy to understand. When  people look at the search engine results, they tend to scan them, and they are usually  looking for words similar to those they typed to get to the results page. For this  reason, titles containing the exact match to a search phrase tend to get clicked on  more often.  Although the need to include your keyword phrase in the title limits creativity, it  does not prevent you from adding something to give your title a sense of urgency.  For example, Border Collie Puppies for Sale – Going Fast! might entice people to click  to make sure they get the best selection. After all, there are only so many puppies in  each litter.  It is important to make sure your titles are not misleading. The title must match the  content of the page. The search engines don't like misleading titles and neither do  potential customers. If they click on your link thinking they have found exactly what  they were looking for and are given something else instead, they will be annoyed  with you. Most likely, they will hit the back button and click on the next listing,  making a mental note to avoid your site in the future.  When writing for search engine optimization, you also need to pay special attention  to the headlines you include within the content of each page. The search engines  give extra weight to any text that is placed within header tags, so try to include  your targeted keyword phrase in your headlines when possible. Most people have  a tendency to scan the headlines and read only the sections that they find relevant  to their situation. By including headers in your content, you make it easier for your  readers to find what they really need.  Transcending bland, keyword-rich titles Sure, it's great to have keyword-focused titles, but many websites employ page titles  that are little more than a bland keyword repository. Such titles can often rank well in  search, but do little to engage users. An over-emphasis on keywords can often lead to  headings, titles, and text that reads awkwardly, which is not ideal. Let's take a look at  one of our finely-crafted pages to see the techniques we are employing to not only earn  high search rankings but also to engage visitors and turn them into customers:  [ 122 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There is a wealth of sophistication taking place in the prior page. The page ranks  amazingly well in Google within positions 1, 2, or 3 for WordPress SEO company and  WordPress SEO service. The competition for those phrases is fierce.  First, let us look at whether the headlines and the page are keyword-aware, and  we can see that they are! The h1 tag, The Ultimate WordPress SEO Company Service:  TastyPlacement has all our target keywords included. Even our h2 tag, When it comes  to WordPress SEO, we don't kid around includes the phrase WordPress SEO, but doesn't  mindlessly repeat our target phrase. This principle is called partial match—we have  included important target keywords, but not all of the keywords.  Let's now look a little beyond our keyword coverage. Do our headings engage and  speak honestly and without reading awkwardly? Absolutely yes! We have succeeded  in persuading users. We have employed some superlatives, The Ultimate, and  We don't kid around. We have also included trust logos from press mentions we  have received. The graphic highlights the ultimate accolade: our authorship of this  WordPress SEO book. The technique we have applied to this page, can be applied in  any industry.  [ 123 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Organizing your content with WordPress  tags WordPress' tag system is a tool that helps make it easier for users to find the content  they are looking for on your site. Tags are often confused with categories, but tags  work a bit differently. In order to understand how to use WordPress tags, you need  to first be aware of how tags differ in categories and how people find your content  through tags.  Categories are hierarchical in structure. You can have top-level categories, with  subcategories underneath them. Think of categories as a kind of table of contents  for your website. For example, if you have a website about crafts, you might have  top-level categories that are named for the different types of crafts, such as Knitting,  Crochet, and Sewing. Under Knitting, you might have subcategories such as Knitting  Patterns or Knitting Needles. You don't want your categories to be too specific because  your category list would become unwieldy and you would end up with a bunch of  categories with only one entry.  Tags, on the other hand, are meant to be more specific. They help your website visitors  find exactly what they are looking for. Perhaps you have a user visiting your crafts  site, looking for a pattern to make a pair of baby booties. Baby booties can be knit or  crocheted, so rather than looking through both categories, your visitor might find it  easier to look through your tags for Baby booties pattern or Pattern for baby booties.  Unlike categories, tags do not have parents or children, so the tags you choose  should be complete enough to give the user a good idea of whether, they will find  what they are looking for on that page. You wouldn't use the tag Pink for a pattern  to knit baby booties, because it doesn't tell your visitor much at all about the post. A  post that is relevant to the tag Pink could be just about anything.  When you assign tags to a post, think about what terms people would look for if  your website was a book, and if they were looking at the index in the back to find   out which page to turn to. Those are the terms you should use as tags for the post.   In addition, you should add the keyword phrase or phrases that you are targeting   in the post.  In addition to helping your site visitors find the information they are looking for,  using tags and categories helps increase traffic to your website. These tag and  category pages get indexed by the search engines just like any other page on your  site. This leads to a warning: tag pages, if overused, can cause large swaths of  duplicate content.  [ 124 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Stay focused on a few tags per post. Also, tags should never  be used to stuff keywords—to do so will have no effect.  Creating keyword-aware content It may seem unnatural to focus on a keyword when writing content for your website,  but it is absolutely essential for writing your pages in a manner that will get them  ranked highly in the search engines. Note that, the title of this chapter includes the  phrase keyword-aware, rather than keyword-rich. Too many inexperienced webmasters,  once they discover the magic effect of including keywords in their content, go  overboard with keywords. You need not bludgeon the search engines by mindless  repeating keywords in singular and plural, and every synonym in between. Google  is very sophisticated. A light touch will work best: write content naturally with a few  mentions of keywords, and Google will get the message.  That said, no matter how well-written your content is, if it doesn't contain the  keywords and phrases that people use to search for your product or service, your  pages are unlikely to show up in the search engine results pages.  For this reason, the first step in creating the content for your site is to begin with the  right keywords. We learnt in Chapter 3, Researching and working With Keywords, how  to research keywords, find the big-money keywords and key phrases, and organize  and prioritize them. With sound keyword research, writing flows naturally: start  with the high-volume, high-value keywords and write high-quality content for your  site that focuses on those keywords.  It's best to target one keyword phrase or a group of phrases per content page—this  is vital. Recall that keyword overlap can give us a close group of keywords such as  Miami AC and Miami AC repair. In any case, keep each content page very focused on  a small group of words.  [ 125 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Whichever phrase or phrases you are targeting, should be used several times, but  not dozens of times within the body content. You should make sure to include the  keyword phrase in the title and headings, as well as a few times throughout the actual  content. It is especially important to include your keyword phrase near the beginning  of your content. Most search engines tend to give more weight to words and phrases  that appear in the first few paragraphs of a web page. Remember that search engines  determine the subject of your page from the words you use on the page. If you don't  use the keyword phrase often enough, your page will not rank for that phrase. If  your page is selling book covers and you are targeting the keyword phrase; Buy book  covers, that phrase needs to appear on the page in several places. First of all, it must be  included in the title and somewhere in the first paragraph of the copy. In addition, you  should try to work it into the rest of the copy at least two to three more times, and into  the headings that separate different sections of copy. You can also add the keyword  phrase to the alt text for any photos that appear on the page.  Keeping it natural The main thing to remember about writing keyword-aware content is that, it should  appear natural when you read it back. However, some writers are more skillful  than others at making a keyword fit with the copy. If you have trouble fitting your  keyword phrase into the copy in a way that makes sense, it's possible that you may  have better results by outsourcing the writing to someone who specializes in writing  for SEO.  If you prefer to write your own copy, you'll find that you will improve as you get  more practice. Like anything else, writing SEO website copy is a skill that must be  developed. Some people have a knack for it and pick it up quickly, while others  require more time and practice to develop the skill.  No matter how skilled you are at writing a copy, you will undoubtedly come across  keyword phrases that are awkward and will be hard to work into your website  content. This is especially true for search queries that are written in the first person.  It's not too hard to come up with a title for How do I tie a tie, for example, but once  you get past the title and introduction, it becomes difficult to work that keyword  phrase into the copy because you have switched gears from asking the question to  trying to answer it.  Some people choose to avoid awkward keyword phrases because of the increased  difficulty of writing this type of content well enough to avoid losing the reader.  [ 126 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Sometimes, the potential traffic for an awkward keyword phrase  makes it worth trying. You'll have to decide for yourself on a  case-by-case basis, whether you want to try to rank for these  types of keyword phrases.  Another type of keyword phrase that can be difficult to target, is the one with a  misspelled word. Although many people have profited from targeting misspelled  keywords, it is harder to achieve now because Google has grown adept at correcting  misspelled search queries automatically. This practice should be avoided entirely.  Avoiding automated content plugins Creating fresh, original content for your WordPress site or blog is tedious. For  this reason, many people have been enticed into using automated plugins to add  content to their sites. Some WordPress plugins that have cropped up to satisfy this  misguided demand are AutoBlogged, WP Robot, and MultiPress plugins. However,  no automated script can deliver original content for your website. When you employ  an automated content plugin on your site, you are getting content that has already  been published by another website. This is what is referred to as duplicate content.  Duplicate content does not mean that the content necessarily triggers copyright  infringement  although it might ; you are not necessarily running afoul of the law  by posting duplicate content. In fact, there are hundreds of article directories that  encourage you to take their content and republish it on your website. However,  duplicate content has little to no value to a search strategy. Most likely, search  engines won't even bother to index the content. And, even if the duplicate content is  indexed, your pages won't rank well and your site will earn little trust or authority.  You are not only competing against the site that originally published the article, but  every other site that has used the content.  Another problem with autoblogging plugins is that, some of them pull content that  is not freely available for use, in this case, raising legal issues regarding the use of  the content. They often pull content from RSS feeds, that include the posts from  other people's blogs or websites instead of pulling only from article directories that  allow republishing. The companies that sell these autoblogging scripts justify this, by  saying that the blogger provided the RSS feed, so they have a right to use it.  However, most bloggers do not intend for their RSS feeds to be used in this way.  They are meant to provide a way for their readers to subscribe to their posts, not a  means for other site owners to steal their content.  [ 127 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   It's good to remember that all original content that appears on other people's sites  is covered by copyright laws, and these writers have the right to take you to court if  you steal their content to use on your site.  Perhaps the most important reason to avoid using automated content  plugins is that, Google warns that sites that use such content may be  subject to ranking penalties. In the help section for Google's Webmaster  Tools, Google states that it will penalize sites that attempt to rank pages  by including content that provides little or no value to the reader.  The examples Google gives are affiliate sites that provide no original  content but serve only to act as a middleman by sending the visitor to  a site where they can buy the product, doorway pages that are only  meant for search engines, scraped content, and auto-generated content.  The last two of these are exactly what you get, when you use an  autoblogging plugin to create content for your website.  When you use autoblogging plugins to post scraped or auto-generated content on  your website, you risk having your site removed from the search engine results.  In addition, if you use AdSense on this type of site, you could end up having your  website, or even your entire account, banned from the AdSense program.  The ranking power of truly original content cannot be denied. In addition, if you  write your content to target a specific keyword, it is a good bet that it will be easier  to rank your own content for that keyword than anything you scrape from the web.  A large portion of the work you need to do to get a web page ranked is getting  backlinks; so even though you might be able to get a lot of content on your website  quickly by using one of these plugins, you'll still have a lot of hard work to do in  building enough links to your pages to get them to rank. If you are going to put  that much effort into ranking a page, why not use your own content to begin with  and avoid the risk of having your site banned by Google for publishing scraped or  automated content?  Writing for your audience Many people think that all they have to do is learn how to get traffic to their  websites, and they will achieve their website goals, but there is more to it than that.  Writing web pages that are optimized for the search engines is only half the battle.   If you want to make money, you need to write for your audience, not just for the  search engines.  [ 128 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Search engines use mathematical algorithms to determine ranking because they  have to. No machine can read and think like a human. That's why you need to write  content that uses the exact keyword phrase you are targeting, rather than writing like  you would talk if you were interacting with your customers one-on-one. However,  once a visitor lands on your site, if the content doesn't make sense to them, they will  click on the back button and go find what they're looking for elsewhere.  It's the people who visit your site who will determine whether you make any money.  They will come to your website looking for something, and if you provide them with  whatever they are looking for, they will stick around for awhile and maybe even buy  something. It's your job to figure out what they're looking for.  One of the most common things people look for online is information. They may  be looking for information that tells them how to do something, information about  a product, or information to write a report for school. Regardless of what type of  information they need, if they don't find it on your web page, they will not stay long.  They will keep looking on other websites, until they find what they need.  Thinking about a searcher's intent For this reason, you need to think about the keyword phrase you are targeting and  determine what type of information the searcher is looking for. If the keyword  phrase is a question or starts with the words How to, this is a pretty easy task. You  can write an article or post that answers the question or provides step-by-step  instructions for doing whatever it is the searcher is trying to learn to do, and your  visitor will be happy. Of course, not all search terms are this easy. If someone is searching for poker, what  do they want? They could be looking for an online poker website, poker rules, or a  poker for the fireplace. The best option, in this case, may be to pass up the keyword  phrase altogether and target something more specific. However, if you have a  keyword phrase you feel could be potentially profitable and fairly easy to get ranked,  you might not want to overlook it just because it is vague.  When targeting this type of keyword phrase, you can either try to please everyone or  try to guess at the most likely motives of the person doing the search. For example, if  you type poker into the Google AdWords keyword tool and sort by global monthly  search volume, you'll see that the most popular search besides poker that contains  that word is Play poker. For this reason, you might assume that most people  searching for Poker, are looking for information on how to play the game. Or, if you  want to play it safe, you could create a single page that is targeted to the keyword  Poker and contains a basic overview of the things, the searcher is most likely to look  for, and that links to additional pages that contain more detailed information.  [ 129 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you have a site that sells products, you will probably have better results if you  target buying keywords. These are keywords, that are most likely to be used by  searchers who are serious about making a purchase. For example, someone who  searches for New Balance shoes on sale is ready to buy. They already know what  kind of shoes they want. At this point, they are just looking for the best price. Other  examples of buying keywords are keyword phrases that include buy, purchase, under  $100, and other related terms, as well as extremely specific product keywords, such  as those containing a model number. People who search for a specific model number  have usually already done their research and decided what they want. Now, they  just need to find your website to buy it.  Providing quality information Giving your visitors what they are looking for is a good start, but there are other  things you need to consider when writing your content as well, such as providing  quality information. Quality information is more than just answering a question; it  is answering it well. If you can provide better content for your targeted keyword  phrase than anyone else, people will link to your page just because you have great  content. This will make it much easier for you to get ranked in the search engines. Perhaps you are targeting How to tie a tie, for example. You've written step-by-step  instructions and either drawn illustrations or taken photographs to show each step.  That's good, but you can easily make it better by including a video as well. Now, your  visitors can decide for themselves whether they'd rather read the instructions, or watch  them. That is quality, and after your visitor gets done tying his her tie, he she might  just share your post on Facebook or Twitter and help you get even more traffic.  Quality content needs to be well-written and free of errors. You don't get quality  content for your website by outsourcing the writing to someone to an offshore  content factory and slapping it up on your site unchecked. You might save money on  the writing by having the work done by someone in a country where labor is cheap,  but once you get the articles back, you will either have to edit them or pay to have  them edited, which often defeats the purpose of having them written cheaply.  You might get away with lower quality content if you are running a personal blog  and monetizing it with AdSense, but if you are building a website for a company that  sells products or services online, you will be held to a higher standard. People expect  businesses to be professional, and spelling and grammar errors don't send that  message. If someone comes to your website to buy something and sees several errors  in the copy, they may wonder about the quality of your products or services.  [ 130 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Providing quality information often means providing more than your visitors expect.  Most websites that sell products provide the exact same product description, which  is usually provided by the manufacturer. You can make your website stand out by  offering something more. A video demonstration of someone actually using the  product can be a very effective tool for making sales as well as providing unique  content for your site that is not available elsewhere.  Writing to get results Every website has a purpose. If you don't know what the purpose of your website  is, you need to figure it out before you write your content. Each page needs to have  a goal and the content must be written in such a way that it helps you achieve that  goal. There are many different actions users can take when they visit a website, and  your copy should steer towards the action you want them to take.  If you have a website that sells products, you want your website visitors to  buy something. How do you get them to do that? First of all, you give them the  information they need to make a decision. You tell them all about the product,  describing all of its features, and perhaps even using a video to demonstrate how it  is used. Then you need a call to action. Tell them what they need to do to place an  order, and make it easy for them to do so.  It can be tempting to use the description provided by the manufacturer when creating  a web page that is designed to sell a product, but remember that this page still needs to  get ranked in the search engine results as well. If other websites have already used the  product description, you'll be posting duplicate content if you reuse it.  Your website copy will be different, depending on what action you want the user to  take. Not all websites sell products. Some make money through advertising and still  others exist for the purpose of collecting e-mail addresses for a list, or getting people  to request a quote. Whatever your purpose is for the page, the copy should make it  clear what you want the visitor to do.  In addition, the layout of your website plays an important role in getting results  from your traffic. If you are making money from advertising, you have to rely on the  placement of your ads to make sure people notice them because most ad networks  won't allow you to ask your readers to click on the ads. This is the one case where  you can't use a call to action, to let your readers know what action you want them   to take.  [ 131 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The layout of your site can also help if you are trying to get people to sign up for a  newsletter or request a quote, but in this case, your copy needs to work together with  your website layout. You tell the visitor why they should sign up for your newsletter,  and then ask them to do it. A newsletter signup page is usually very simple. There  should be a minimum number of ads or other distractions to keep your visitor from  filling out the e-mail subscription form. The same is true for a site that is collecting  information for other purposes, such as getting requests for quotes. The content of  this type of page should be focused on telling the visitor why they should fill out the  request, and there should be nothing on the page that will take their attention away  from the form.  Once you have decided on a purpose for your website, everything on the site should  be designed to serve that purpose. Every element should be carefully planned to  get the desired result, and once the site starts getting traffic, it should be tested and  tweaked to maximize conversions. Everything from the headline, to the length of the  copy, to the size and color of the subscription form can affect the conversion rate. By  testing, you will be able to determine which layout and copy gets the best results. We  learn about how to test your website in Chapter 10, Testing Your Site and Monitoring  Your Progress.  Developing your writing style The tone you use when writing your content will depend on the type of site, as well  as your target audience. If you are running a personal blog, the tone can be more  casual than if you run a business website. People expect businesspersons to act  professionally. This requires a more formal writing style, that has a polished tone.  For a personal website or blog, you can write the same way you would talk to a  friend. This will give your site a casual tone, which can help you connect with your  readers. They start to feel like they know you because you relate to them in the same  way, that you would if you were talking face to face. If you write like you talk, your  voice will come through and reflect your personality. This makes it easier for your  readers to like you, and they will be more likely to become regular readers, perhaps  even adding to the discussion by posting comments of their own.  When writing for a business or professional website, imagine that you are writing  a letter to the editor, which will be published in a newspaper or magazine and read  by many people. You want to give a good impression, so you choose your words  carefully. You make a conscious effort to avoid anything, that will make your writing  style seem too familiar.  [ 132 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Some of the things you must avoid when writing in a formal style are slang and  contractions. We use these all the time when we're speaking, but these words should  generally never be used in formal writing. If you want to convey a professional  image, you must be careful to avoid anything that sounds informal. Slang and  contractions are among the worst offenders. In formal writing, empty phrases such as You may be thinking or Do you know that  should be avoided. You should not presume to put thoughts into your readers' heads  or try to fill up the page by adding words that don't add any meaning. The length of  your sentences is a part of your writing style as well.  Narrative styles The point of view you use to write your copy also depends on how formal you want  your site to be and at what level you want to interact with your audience. If you're  writing in a casual style, you'll want to write in the first person or second person  style. A more formal writing style requires a formal third person narrative.  When writing in the first person, you write from your own point of view. This style  of narrative involves using the word I in the copy as related to your readers on a  personal level. Many blogs are written in a casual first person style. This style is  most appropriate if you are talking about things you have actually done, rather than  writing how-to or other informational articles.  The second person style is also considered casual, but when writing in the second  person, you avoid using the word I, while still referring to the reader as you. You are  speaking directly to the reader, giving him advice or information that will help him  without making it all about you. This style allows you to write as if you are speaking  directly to the reader, without drawing attention to yourself. In the third person narrative, you don't use I or you in your writing. Instead, you  use a more matter-of-fact tone and refer to the people you write about as he or she.  The third person narrative style requires you to write, as if you are a narrator who is  detached from the story or article, rather than someone who is involved in it. When  you write in the third person, you write as if you are an observer and merely passing  on your observations to others.  Once you have decided on a narrative style to use for your website, you should try  not to jump around from one point of view to another on various pages of your  site. Your writing style should be consistent throughout the entire website to avoid  disorienting your readers.  [ 133 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Your writing should also be clear and concise. You can ramble on for hundreds  of words without saying anything, but if you do, you will lose your readers. Get  right to the point and avoid unnecessary verbiage. Most people don't want to read  thousands of words of copy online.  If you have a lot of information to cover, however, you may find that it takes   more than the usual 300 to 500 words of a typical web page to say everything   that needs to be said. It's fine to write longer copy as long as it isn't filled up   with meaningless chatter.  Avoid using clichés in your writing. A cliché is an expression that has been overused  to the point that it has become a common expression, such as older but wiser and live  and learn. Readers find these expressions boring, because they have heard them so  many times. Try to think of a new and fresh way to say things, and you will keep  your reader's attention longer.  You only have one chance to capture your reader's attention and keep it. If your   copy doesn't engage the reader, he she will leave your site and go somewhere else.  You need to start with a strong lead paragraph and keep your copy clear, focused,  and free of excess words in order to hold the reader's attention long enough to get  him her to take the desired action for that page.  Structuring your content using taxonomy  and hierarchy Setting up the proper structure for your content not only makes it easier for your  visitors to find what they're looking for, but it also helps the search engines find and  index your content. Although both categories and tags can be used to organize your  content, they are not the same thing. Categories break your website into sections  that organize your site in a hierarchy, making it easier for users to locate information  related to a certain topic through WordPress' built-in navigation. Tags, on the other  hand, are free-form identifiers. The tags you use for a given post usually include the  primary keyword, as well as any secondary or long tail keywords you hope to be  able to rank for with that WordPress Post.  [ 134 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using WordPress categories The categories you employ for your site depend on the content. Your main categories  should break the site up into manageable chunks without getting too specific. If you  own a website that sells pet supplies, for example, you might start by dividing the  site into categories by animal. People who have dogs are not going to be interested  in bird stuff, so break it down for them. Include main categories such as Dogs, Cats,  Birds, and Fish to help people find the pet supplies they need faster.  If your site sells supplies for dogs only, not for other types of animals, you'll need  to set your categories up differently. Your top-level categories might include things  like Dog Collars and Leashes, whereas the general pet supply store above might  use these same labels as subcategories under Dogs. Because categories in WordPress  are hierarchical, you can continue breaking categories into subcategories for as many  levels as it makes sense to do so.  Because there are many different types of dog collars, it would make sense to break  up the collars category even further. Perhaps you might make subcategories for  Leather Dog Collars, Dog Training Collars, and Nylon Dog Collars. Do you  go deeper and start breaking them up by color or size? That's up to you, and will  probably depend on how many items you offer that would fit in each subcategory. If  your Nylon Dog Collars subcategory has hundreds of items in it, you might want  to break it up a little more. Keep in mind that excessive subcategories can tend to  confuse both readers and search engines. It's a good practice to keep category levels  no more than three-levels deep unless absolutely necessary.  Keep in mind when creating categories, that people start at the top and browse their  way down through your hierarchy. No one will even see Dog Collars until they click on Dogs, so don't try to sneak in a  few items for ferrets just to avoid making a new top-level category. If you do, people  who visit your site looking for ferret supplies will look at your categories, assume  that you don't have anything for ferrets and leave. If you want to avoid having a long  list of categories but still cover everything, try making a category for Other and set  it to appear at the bottom of the list. That's way, people who are looking for supplies  for less popular pets such as ferrets and snakes can still find them.  [ 135 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Managing your categories with plugins You may find that you don't like the way your categories are displayed by default  in WordPress—a common complaint. Perhaps, you want to hide certain categories,  change the order in which they appear, or change the way they look when they  are displayed on your blog. There are several plugins available that will help you  display your categories exactly the way you want them to be shown. Here are a few  that you might want to try, if you use the self-hosted version of WordPress.  Advanced Category Excluder The Advanced Category Excluder plugin allows you to hide selected categories from  certain parts of your site while still displaying them on others. If you don't want  to display the top-level categories for other animals once your visitor has clicked  on Dogs, you can use this plugin to do that. This can also help with SEO because  excluding these links, which have anchor text listing other animals, can make your  dog pages appear more focused on dogs. You can find the plugin at: http:   wordpress.org extend plugins advanced-category-excluder .  Multi Column Category List plugin The Multi Column Category List plugin lets you create a category list that spans two  or more WordPress columns. The plugin can be set up to divide your categories at  a certain point in the alphabet and it also allows you to set up custom headers for  each column. You can find the plugin at http:  www.dagondesign.com articles  multi-column-category-list-plugin-for-wordpress .  My Category Order The My Category Order plugin lets you change the order in which your categories  are listed on your WordPress site, which, by default, is alphabetical. You can find the  plugin at http:  geekyweekly.com mycategoryorder.  Fold Category List The Fold Category List plugin helps keep your category list from getting too long.  If you have a lot of categories and subcategories, you may find that your category  list stretches further than your posts. This plugin allows you to display a list of  categories in which only the current category is expanded, while the others are  displayed as collapsed, with no children showing. This keeps your category list  looking more manageable. You can find it at http:  www.webspaceworks.com  resources wordpress 31 .  [ 136 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Hiring a writer SEO professionals know how to write engaging and keyword-rich content, but  most of them have a little secret: they write very little of their own content. These  webmasters turn to SEO copyrighters. An SEO copyrighter is simply a writer  who has written in a search environment, and therefore knows how to craft titles,  headings, and body copy, based on a keyword or keyword group.  Regular writers will certainly do in a pinch; you might need to tweak content  provided by regular writers to achieve SEO goals. You can also always employ  regular writers when your content is intended for other than purely ranking  purposes, such as with ordinary blog posts or company updates.  When you hire an SEO copyrighter, the good copyrighters will ask for a few key  parameters before they write, What are the keywords? and What sort of keyword density  do you want? These questions are signs of a copyrighter with SEO experience. Ideally,  your writer will let you dictate specific keyword phrases, will write titles and  headings in addition to body copy, will let you dictate keyword density, and will  even let you suggest the tone, style, and voice of the article.  Where to hire content writers There are many sources for hiring content writers. The first question is quality; the  quality of online content writing varies tremendously. The poorest quality writing   it's also the least expensive  comes from offshore content shops that advertise in  webmaster forums. In some cases, such shops scrape original content from existing  websites and process the articles through spinning software. Spinning software takes an existing body of text and spins the article to create a  variation through the substitution of homonyms. Such software is the source of  much of the gibberish found on the Internet. So, you should seek the counsel of a  registered professional might be spun into something like one is compelled to aim to the  advice of certified expert.  Once you've seen spinning software in action, such articles are pretty easy to spot.  Even if offshore articles are originals, they'll tend to be weak. A 300-word article  from an offshore shop can cost between $2 and $5. If you employ such services, don't  expect high quality writing, and don't expect quality search rankings.  Responsible webmasters use EFL  English as first language  writers either working  as freelancers, through text brokering services, or with an SEO copyrighting service.  Here, the prices vary widely. In the local market of Austin, Texas, a 500-word article  can cost between $18 and $300. The high end of such pricing is rare, but is offered as  a premium service by some specialized SEO copyrighting services.  [ 137 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Some great ways to find solid SEO writers at competitive prices are to either post the  position in the gigs section of Craigslist.org or simply browse through the services  section of Craigslist and find authors advertising their services.  There is another option: text brokering services. There are dozens of websites online  that work just like ELance.com—where writing services are offered and sought.  With any writing service, it's touch-and-go. There are good writers and bad writers  that populate all such services. You'll have some misses in the beginning, until you  find writers that deliver quality products at a good price. Hiring out some or all of  your writing can be a great way to build up content quickly.  Summary Ideally, this chapter illuminated the concepts that can help you implement a sound  and effective content development strategy. We considered ways in which you  can fully engage your visitors with content and learnt to write effective titles and  headlines to gain the reader's attention from the start. We moved on to examine  WordPress' built-in tag functionality to expand the reach of your content, and  making it easier for users to find.  We learned how to create keyword-rich content that is ready-made for search  engines—which users find natural and easy to read. We learned about writing styles:  casual versus business, and first-person versus third person. We learned how to adapt  WordPress' category structure and hierarchy to organize your content and make it  easy to find. Finally, we learned some approaches to hiring out your writing jobs.  With this chapter, we've now got a grasp of the role of content writing in our   overall WordPress ranking strategy. Now, we will move on to the all-important  arena of link building.  [ 138 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Link Building  We now turn to the true source of ranking power: link building. All of our efforts  in content writing and on-page optimization will fail if we do not undertake link  building. Let's begin with a simple definition: link building is simply the process of  encouraging other webmasters to create hypertext links from their website to yours.  Remember the analogy: on-page optimization factors are akin to tuning and  building a race car; link building is the fuel that makes the car go. Without on-page  optimization, the car will run slowly. Without inbound links, the car will lack the  power to move.  One of Google's many ground-breaking innovations was the employment of inbound  links as a measurement of the relative value and popularity of a website. The idea  was that popular sites were popular for a reason, and if Google returned popular  pages in its search results, then it was generally returning the best results to a search  query. Google applied the term PageRank to the mathematical formula underlying  this idea, and the elements of the process and many variants and extensions are now  the subject of patents worldwide. Before this innovation, search results were based  entirely on on-page factors. Now, inbound linking is a principal component of the  algorithms of all major search engines.  And so, link building is a vital element of any search strategy. However, search  engines are also keenly aware of attempts to manipulate rankings through link  building, so caution is warranted.  In this chapter, we'll begin by covering some general topics in link building, such  as do follow no follow links and authority links. These concepts will color our  entire discussion of link building methods. We'll learn about PageRank, Google's  trademarked and patented process for counting the inbound votes we receive as  links from other websites. We'll learn how to accurately measure the number and  quality of inbound links that you garner.  [ 139 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We'll then delve into the craft of link building itself. We'll cover how to evaluate  websites as potential link partners. We'll learn several techniques to help build links,  including how to request links directly from other webmasters, and how to create the  link bait.  Understanding the importance of  backlinks A backlink is a hypertext link on another website that points back to your website.  Backlinks are also called inbound links, whereas a link on your website pointing to  another website is called an outbound link. Backlinks are important for two reasons:  1.  First, they bring traffic to your website, as web visitors to other sites follow   the links to your website.  2.  Second, as we have learned, Google and the other search engines examine   both the number and quality of inbound links as a measure of a page's  quality. Sites with high numbers of quality inbound links are seen as more  valuable and are ranked more highly than sites with either lower numbers of  inbound links or lower quality inbound links.  Google simply employs the inherent democracy of the Web: sites that other  webmasters have linked to are most likely to be the better pages on the Web, and  so they represent better quality content. Google stated in the Corporate Information  section of its website Pages that we believe are important pages receive a higher PageRank  and are more likely to appear at the top of the search results. The other search engines  employ related approaches.  The mathematics and operation of PageRank Google's PageRank is part of its search algorithm; the other search engines' ranking  algorithms work similarly. Yahoo! and Bing, while they obviously measure inbound  link counts as a ranking factor, do not disclose to web users any measure of page  value equivalent to PageRank. PageRank works through complex mathematics.  Understanding the mathematical intricacies is not vital, but can help illuminate how  PageRank impacts your link-building efforts. PageRank works the same on all web  platforms, WordPress or otherwise.  [ 140 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   PageRank calculations works as follows: Google assigns a numerical value to each  indexed page on the Web. When an indexed page hyperlinks to another page on  the Web, a portion of that numerical value is passed from the linking page to the  destination page, thereby increasing the destination page's PageRank. Inbound links  increase the PageRank of your web pages and outbound links decrease PageRank. PageRank, often abbreviated as PR, is expressed as a number from 0 to 10. Google. com and Facebook.com, both of which benefit from millions of inbound links, enjoy  a PageRank of 9—very close to the highest available score. In common parlance, a  PageRank 10 site is referred to as a PR10 site. Remember that PageRank refers to pages on the web, not just sites themselves. A  PR5 site simply means that the site's front page is a PR5.  Let us examine how PageRank is specifically calculated. Every indexed page on  the Web enjoys a small amount of PageRank on its own, a PageRank score of 1.  This inherent PageRank is the original source of all PageRanks on the Web; it is  only through linking between pages and sites that some pages accumulate higher  PageRank than others.  The PageRank damping factor However, a page can never send all of its PageRank to other pages—this is where the  damping factor comes into play. The damping factor is simply a number between  zero and one  but think of it as 0 to 100 on a percentage scale ; it represents the  amount of PageRank that can be sent away from a page when that page links out to  other pages.  If a search algorithm's damping factor was set to 0, no page would ever send its  PageRank away, and the entire PageRank calculation becomes pointless. On the  other hand, if the damping factor is set to 1, then 100 percent of a page's PageRank is  sent away through outbound linking, and any page with any outbound links retains  no PageRank. In this case, the algorithm also fails—the Internet would be populated  entirely with the sites of either PR0 or PR10, with no sites in between.  As it happens, the damping factor employed by Google is widely believed to be  .85. This means that 85 percent of a page's PageRank is available to be passed to  other pages through linking, while 15 percent of a page's PageRank will always be  retained. It is believed that Google can alter the damping factor for particular sites.  [ 141 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Expert Resource For a superbly crafted and detailed explanation of the complex  mathematics of PageRank, see Ian Roger's classic blog post The  Google PageRank Algorithm and How It Works  www.sirgroane. net google-page-rank  .  Consider for a moment that Google manages PageRank calculations for billions of  web pages. If that wasn't daunting enough, consider that Google undertakes the even  more staggering task of managing the mathematical calculations of immeasurable  numbers of links between those billions of sites.  The following graphical illustration, from Wikipedia, of PageRank calculations  for a hypothetical group of web pages shows that the PageRank distribution is  accumulated in site B because it enjoys a high number of links. C enjoys a high  PageRank because of its single inbound link from site B. The sites represented by the  small circles at the bottom of the illustration retain only 1.6 percent of the PageRank  distribution because they link outward and have no inbound links.  [ 142 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   PageRank is shared among outbound links Also bear in mind that the amount of PageRank available to be passed by a page will  be equally divided among all the outbound links on that page. So, if a web page has  a total of six links: three internal links  links between pages within the same website ,  and three outbound links  links to outside websites , then the PageRank passed away  by that page will be shared equally among the six links on that page.  What does that mean for the link builder? Well, it means that if you have secured a link  on a great PR4 page, but that page has 200 outbound links, then you'll be sharing the  available PageRank with the other 199 sites. That's why you want to seek out pages on  other websites with low numbers of outbound links. When there are fewer outbound  links, your link will enjoy a much greater percentage of the available PageRank.  If the mathematics underlying PageRank isn't complicated enough, there is another  facet that you must consider. The PageRank scale of PR1 to PR10 isn't linear, it is  logarithmic. Therefore, it takes 10 times as much linking power to rise from a PR2 to  a PR3 page. Expressed another way, a PR4 page has 100 times the linking power of  a PR2 page. As each level of PageRank is reached, it becomes harder and harder to  reach the next level. There are only about 120 to 150 PR10 pages at any given time,  and generally this elite class of pages and sites includes Google.com, Microsoft.com,  WhiteHouse.gov, and other sites of equivalent popularity and character.  PageRank is historical and only updated every few years or so. Years ago, PageRank  was updated much more frequently. When you check the PageRank of a page, you  aren't seeing the current PageRank, you are seeing the PageRank reported as of the  last PageRank update. You can check the PageRank of any page on the internet by  using the free SEO Site Tools extension for the Chrome Chromium browser.  Learning to discount PageRank PageRank remains a measure of the value of a link, and the measure of how much  link power you've accumulated on your pages. However, as Google's capabilities  have grown, Google has layered other ranking factors into their algorithm. PageRank  alone is not nearly as important as it once was. Google is quick to point out that it  employs over 200 separate signals to rank websites.  [ 143 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding trust as a ranking principle "A parallel ranking principle that operates alongside PageRank is Trust. Google  employee Matt Cutts has made an official statement in a Google Webmaster video   https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=ALzSUeekQ2Q  regarding the principle  of trust as, "sort of a catch-all term we use...we use several words: reputation,  trust, authority...how much are we willing to believe that this is a high-quality  page". While PageRank is a component of the trust principle, trust can be indicated  in ways other than raw mathematical PageRank."  So, two websites of equal PageRank might send vastly different amounts of trust to  a website when they link to it. A website for a local municipality with a PageRank  of 4 will send far more trust when it links to another website than a spammy  general directory with the same PageRank. A local municipality website is likely to  have many trusted links from other trusted sites, like other government and civic  websites, perhaps some university websites—trust accumulates in websites much in  the way that PageRank does.  Understanding the importance of website category Another way trust can be earned through link building is to secure links from related  websites. A website in the same general topic category sends stronger trust signals and  more ranking power when it links to a website in the same topical category.  If you offer online driver training courses on your website, a link from other  driver education websites will offer far more ranking power than a link from a  fashion blogger. The principle is sound: links are more likely to meaningfully  identify important websites and pages if the websites share a common topic. This  approach was tested and the results compiled in a technical paper by a Stanford  University student, Taher Haveliwala, who later worked for Google as a software  engineer. The paper is entitled Topic-Sensitive PageRank: A Context-Sensitive Ranking  Algorithm for Web Search and can be found on the web at http:  goo.gl 9jH4P5.  The paper is highly technical but concludes that a simple PageRank algorithm can  be greatly improved if only inbound links from websites in related categories are  used to calculate PageRank. Even if Google did not adopt the exact approach Taher  suggested in his study, Google certainly adopted some variant whereby in-category  links deliver more ranking power.  [ 144 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Distinguishing between dofollow and  nofollow links But, what if a webmaster wants to link out to another site but not send away its  valuable PageRank or trust? That's where nofollow links come into play. A nofollow  link is a link that search engines do not record as a link, so no PageRank passes. By  contrast, a dofollow link is a link that does pass PageRank. Generally, you want to  secure dofollow inbound links to your website when pursuing your link building  strategy. That said, nofollow links are an important part of the SEO landscape: they  are handy devices in a webmaster's toolbox and can help fine tune your search  strategy, as we will learn.  Understanding nofollow links Here is how nofollow links came into being. Because the effect of PageRank and  inbound links is so important to rankings, the Internet became  and still is  fairly  polluted with link spam. Link spam is simply a low-value link placed on another  website for the purpose of either attracting traffic or PageRank. Common locations  for link spam are the comment sections of WordPress or Typepad blogs  called  comment spam  and human-edited sites like Wikipedia.  As a way to eliminate the incentive for link spam, Google announced in 2005 that it  was adopting a nofollow specification that would operate as an extension of HTML:  the nofollow specification was little more than a short bit of code embedded in a  hyperlink that let the webmasters signal to the search engines not to pass PageRank  for the particular links. The specification calls for the inclusion of a code snippet   rel="nofollow"  within the active portion of a link.  How to implement or identify a nofollow link What follows is a code example of how to implement or identify a nofollow link:  it's very simple and takes only a few seconds. The following link shows a standard  hypertext link written in HTML:   SEO Book   To modify the link to make it nofollow, we simply add the rel="nofollow" code  within the opening tag:   SEO Book   [ 145 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When Google encounters a link that includes the nofollow attribute, Google does not  pass PageRank or trust via that link. The nofollow attribute says to search engines,  Yes, there is a link here, but I don't want to pass PageRank to this site. The nofollow  standard now applies to all major search engines; quickly after Google's adoption of  the nofollow standard, Yahoo! and MSN Live  now Bing  adopted it as well.  The theory behind the adoption of nofollow links was that if the links on a site were  not followed, then spammers wouldn't bother posting links because they would  get no PageRank benefits for the links. For the most part, it worked. Big sites like  Wikipedia implemented the nofollow standard on all outgoing links, and as a result,  the amount of link spam dropped considerably.  Avoiding and identifying nofollow links Ten years ago, before the adoption of the nofollow specification, all links passed  PageRank, so any link you secured for your website increased your ranking  power. Nowadays, you need to be aware of which links are dofollow and which  are nofollow. When link building, you don't want to waste time securing a lot of  nofollow links—such links simply don't carry the same benefit as a dofollow link.  When you are browsing sites looking for potential links, you need to be able to  swiftly and reliably identify whether a site offers dofollow or nofollow links. So,  say you have found a blog with a relevant post, and you want to add a meaningful  comment to the post with a link back to your site. However, you need to know  something very important: are the comment links in the particular blog dofollow,  or has the webmaster set them to nofollow? There are two ways to tell if a link is  dofollow or nofollow:  1.  Examine the code. You can manually examine the code to see if the link has   the rel="nofollow" snippet within the markup for that particular link.  Depending on your browser, you can find the menu entry for View source  or View source code  all browsers have this functionality somewhere in their  menu . The disadvantage to this method is that you may have to dig through  a lot of code to find what you are looking for.  2.  Get a browser plugin. There are several free browser plugins that will   highlight nofollow links on a page automatically. The SEO Site Tools plugin  for Google's Chrome browser offers this functionality, as does the Search  Status plugin for Firefox.  [ 146 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The screenshot below shows how the SEO Site Tools plugin works in Google's  Chrome browser. The plugin, when set to show nofollow links, highlights all  nofollow links with a red highlighted background, as shown in the screenshot below:  And so, if the blog's comment section is nofollow, then the link you were thinking  of placing probably isn't that worthwhile. You would be wiser to direct your link  building efforts to sites that offer dofollow links.  The diminishing universe of followed links Dofollow links are becoming harder to secure as more and more sites restrict  their outbound links to nofollow to combat spam. Major social media sites such  as Facebook and MySpace restrict all the user-generated links to nofollow. The  link builder's task is harder now than it was several years ago. For this reason, it's  important to quickly locate and identify followed links.  Notable dofollow links, while scarce, do exist. You can secure two high-value links on  your LinkedIn profile, but you cannot choose custom anchor text: you must select the  predefined choices my website and my blog. The legendary DMOZ directory, a PR7 site,  still offers dofollow links for those fortunate enough to gain entry to the directory. We  will cover how to apply for a DMOZ directory listing later in this chapter.  [ 147 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Making use of nofollow links So, how can we employ nofollow links to improve our search strategy? First, we  must consider an important principle related to over-optimization. Because nofollow  links are so ubiquitous, any website that does not have a healthy mix of dofollow  and nofollow inbound links can easily be identified by search engines as having  built links artificially. In other words, nofollow links are natural, so you need to  have some nofollow links. Because you must have some nofollow links anyway,  you might as well secure at least some of your nofollow links from high-value  authority sites like Facebook, MySpace, and Wikipedia. Generally, you want to link- build aggressively but naturally. If you pick up a few nofollow links along the way,  you need not worry that those links do not pass PageRank, you'll be building link  naturally as you should.  PageRank – summary and conclusion If the complex math of Google's PageRank calculation has your head spinning,  do not worry. The math is not what is truly important. What is truly important is  that inbound links are the source of ranking power and if you build links naturally  and effectively, you will rank naturally and effectively. We can distill the thorny  mathematics of PageRank to a few core principles that will help guide our link  building efforts:      Inbound links help accumulate PageRank on your pages and can help you  rank better for your chosen keywords.     Outbound links on your web pages send PageRank away from your site.    The PageRank calculation operates internally within your site's pages as well.  If you want to accumulate PageRank within certain pages or sections of your  website, you can direct this flow of PageRank by sending more internal links  to particular high-value pages. If you secure only dofollow inbound links with no nofollow links, your   link profile will not appear natural and your site may be penalized by   search engines.      [ 148 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Authority links – what they are and why  you want them There is a measure of power that some links possess that is independent of PageRank,  and it is the principle of authority links. The principle is closely related to trust.  Authority links are links from websites that have established a substantial degree  of trust and authority with search engines as a result of their age, quality, and size.  Authority is a somewhat subjective concept. Unlike PageRank, neither Google nor the  other search engines offer any public reference or guidelines as to what constitutes an  authority site or authority link. Authority sites are going to be the market's leading  sites, sites representing established government and educational institutions, large  corporations, or leading websites. Authority links can bring tremendous ranking  power to a website, if one is lucky enough to obtain one or more.  Authority links are the golden eggs of link building. They tend to be extremely  difficult links to get, and, for that reason, most webmasters rarely get them. The best  approach to authority links is to be vigilant for opportunities to obtain them, but it is  most likely fruitless to waste time in seeking them out.  Our discussion of PageRank and authority links leads naturally to the notion of the  relative power of inbound links.  No two links are the same in terms of power. The degree of authority of  a site, the PageRank of the page upon which the link appears, and the  number of outbound links on the page where your link appears, will  affect the relative value of the links you obtain. That said, almost all  links are worthwhile, even lower value links. With what we've learned  in the previous few pages, you will have a strong sense of how to  evaluate link opportunities and to evaluate the relative strength of links.  Sometimes you'll be forced to settle for low-value links but in higher volumes, as  is the case with link directories, though never fall into the trap of thinking that the  only links worth getting are high-authority, high-PageRank links. All links are good  for your rankings  except links from link farms and content farms, from where you  should never seek out links .  Link anchor text A vital concept in link building is link anchor text. Link anchor text is the word or  words that constitute the visible text of the link itself, the blue underlined text as it is  often called. The anchor text of a link is a powerful ranking factor; anchor text serves  as a signpost to Google as to the content and subject of the destination page.  [ 149 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   How anchor text appears in HTML code The anchor text of a link is coded by placing the desired text between the opening  and closing markup of the hyperlink, as follows:   This Is Anchor Text   Controlling the link anchor text of inbound links is vital whenever possible. The  problem is that you can't always control the anchor text of inbound links, and  unfortunately, the higher quality the link is, the more restricted you'll be in choosing  anchor text. A perfect example is the DMOZ directory. A link in the DMOZ directory  is a great link to get, but DMOZ dictates that the anchor text you select should be  the name of your website or the name of your business. DMOZ does not allow you  to stuff keywords into the anchor text. Here lies another good reason to choose a  keyword-rich domain name for your website and business. When your business name  is carefully crafted to comprise keywords, like Austin Air Conditioning, then you can  employ those high-volume keywords more easily in your link building efforts.  To continue an example from an earlier chapter, if you have identified the phrases  Jacksonville air conditioning, Jacksonville air conditioning contractors, Jacksonville air  conditioning companies, and Jacksonville air conditioning repair as the keywords around  which a specific page is built, then your anchor text selection is nearly complete. You  can use the same keywords as your desired anchor text.  When you can control the anchor text, you should craft the anchor text of the links  based upon the keywords you have designated for each destination page. With this  device used in connection with sound on-page optimization, tremendous ranking  power comes into focus. Remember that Google and the other search engines have  a primary goal of returning quality search results to their visitors. When anchor  text accords with the on-page elements of a web page, that gives search engines  confidence as to the subject of that page and, when a search engine is confident about  the subject matter, it rewards the page with high rankings.  But be careful with anchor text when gaining links in high numbers. It is unwise   to secure hundreds of links, all with picture-perfect anchor text: this manner   of link building does not appear natural to search engines. There is a risk of   over-optimization when your link anchor text is too perfect. Generally, you never  want more than 30 percent of your anchor text for a particular page to be solely  based on a small family of perfect keywords. Hence, there is a hidden benefit to  garnering links for which you can't control the anchor text, because these links dilute  your principal keywords to some extent.  [ 150 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If your anchor text isn't varied naturally, then you should intentionally  vary the anchor text. Clever SEO professionals sometimes go as far as  to obtain noise links. A noise link is a link with common generic terms  used as the anchor text like Click here or Website.  Not all hyperlinks have anchor text. Images can be hyperlinks, but do not use anchor  text. In this case, search engines register the link, but have no anchor text upon which  to determine the subject matter of the link. Links in image maps and Flash files suffer  from the same limitation. For this reason, such links are less desirable.  Site-wide links and footer links A site-wide link is a link that you obtain and that appears on every page of a  particular website. You often see these links appear as footer links—links that appear  in the footer area of a website. Common sources of footer links are the web designers  that create websites or website templates. So you might ask yourself, If I have a link on every page of a site that has 1,000 pages,   do I receive PageRank and ranking power from every one of those pages? The answer is  No. The search engines have adjusted their algorithms to the reality of footer links.  A site-wide link of any kind, whether in the footer, sidebar, or elsewhere, earns  essentially the same power as a single link. The exact operation of the algorithms in  this regard is uncertain. Some SEO professionals say that a site-wide link is reduced  by the search engines to the equivalent of a single link on the homepage, some  say that there is a maximum of three-to-five linked pages that count towards the  PageRank count and all other pages are ignored. Regardless of how it is calculated,  there is no question that site-wide links carry the rough equivalent of, at best, a  handful of links. Nevertheless, site-wide links can bring substantial traffic if placed  on the right sites.  Repetitive links from common IP addresses A supplemental consideration to receiving repetitive links from the same website  would be receiving links from the same web server. Shared hosting accounts on web  servers all share a common IP address, the numerical Internet identifier that pinpoints  all websites. The IP address is like a signature—and it's a signature that search engines  can follow. Search engines are wise to monitor IP addresses because link farms and  content farms often share the same IP address with each other. Monitoring these IP  addresses helps search engines ferret out unsavory link practices.  [ 151 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   And so, links from the same IP address are most likely discounted by search engines.  You will get credit for one link, but if multiple links originate from the same IP  address, the search engines can fairly determine that the same site owner has linked  more than once and the subsequent links are discounted.  The IP address of a website looks something like 111.222.333.444, four sets of  numbers separated by periods. The 444 in our example is no different from 445 in  the eyes of a search engine—both addresses are seen as sharing the same web server.  However, the 333 portion of our example shares a different class C IP address from  334 and is seen by search engines as a separate location. The more varied the class  C IP addresses from which your links originate, the better. You can determine the  IP address of any website by using the free analysis tool at http:  research. domaintools.com research my-ip .  How to measure your inbound links As a webmaster engaged in the process of optimization and link building, you'll  want to measure and track your link building efforts. Keep in mind that you won't  get a link every time you request one. Not only that, but if the page upon which  you secure a link is not indexed by search engines, then you won't get any traffic or  ranking power from that link. Some pages will be indexed by one search engine and  not others, so your inbound link counts in any particular search engine will differ  from all the others. In the past years, Google indexed more pages than other search  engines, but that has changed since the mid-tier search engines Yahoo! and Bing  began to crawl the web more deeply.  You'll use several methods to measure your inbound links. A great source is the  search engines themselves. There is also specialized software for the purpose of  measuring and evaluating links.  Measuring inbound links with Bing  Webmaster The quickest and easiest way to get a simple and reliable link count is directly from  Bing. This free service, called Bing Webmaster, can be found here https:  bing. com webmaster . You'll need to sign up for an account and add your website and  then verify by dropping a verification file into your web hosting account. Once  you have verified your website, Bing Webmaster provides a range of information,  including inbound links that Bing has identified. Navigate to Reports & Data and  then Inbound Links to see the report. The following screenshot shows a report of  inbound links:  [ 152 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Bing Webmaster inbound link report is a valuable resource. The report is  comprehensive, showing a very complete report of inbound links. A few of the   other inbound link measuring tools discussed below give incomplete link reports.  Measuring inbound links with Google Measuring inbound links with Google is problematic, at least from the standard  Google search window: Google does not show accurate link counts from a browser.  If you enter the following search string into the Google search box, link:yoursite. com, Google will return a greatly deflated link count. A site with tens of thousands of  links might only show a few hundred results with this technique. The links shown  are not dictated by rhyme or reason, Google appears to return random results. This  method is helpful, however, for relative comparisons between sites.  To get accurate link counts, you'll want to check Google Webmaster Tools Search  Console. We learned how to sign up for and install this tool in Chapter 4, Understanding  Technical Optimization. To get your link counts, log in to your Search Console account  at http:  google.com webmasters. From the left-hand navigation, expand the menu  item Search Traffic, and then select Links to your site. In the content area, you will see  your link counts ordered by the number of links. A bonus feature is the How your data  is linked section, in the lower part of the page. This section shows you the anchor text  of inbound links that point to your site.  [ 153 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   One disadvantage of this tool is that you cannot check Google's link counts for your  competitors' sites, because you have to verify site ownership to use the tool.  Measuring inbound links with online tools There are several online tools that let you measure link counts, both for your site and  your competitors' sites. While it's great to have link counts from the search engines  themselves  because they are the arbiters of rankings , the online tools generally  show you more detailed information about the links.  The king of online link count tools is Majestic SEO, which you can find at   http:  majesticseo.com. While basic functionality is free, you'll need a paid  account to see all the available data. To use the tool, simply enter the URL of the site  for which you want to check inbound links. The data table that returns contains a  dizzying amount of information, all of which is valuable to a webmaster.  Majestic SEO's backlink tools offer a tremendous amount of powerful and valuable  information on incoming links. Of particular value is the chart that shows the  number of backlinks acquired each month. The key benefit of Majestic SEO is that the  tool shows the most links of any link reporting tool. Majestic SEO's spiders crawl the  web more deeply, so they show links from the deeper corners of the web.  Among the information returned by the Majestic tool are:     The link count for any given URL    The number of indexed pages for a given URL    The number of .edu and .gov backlinks    The number of individual domains, including .edu and .gov domains upon      The number of separate IP addresses, including separate Class C subnets   which the links appear  upon which the links appear     A chart that shows the number of cumulative backlinks earned over time  [ 154 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Another paid tool that deserves mention: Moz's Open Site Explorer, reachable by  pointing to https:  moz.com researchtools ose . Open Site Explorer, like  Majestic SEO, requires a paid subscription, to be truly useful. A subscription is $100  per month. There are some limitations here: Open Site Explorer does not crawl the  web deeply, so it won't show you all of your inbound links. In general, Open Site  Explorer will show you only your most valuable links. However, it offers a feature  of tremendous value: it scores websites and pages with Moz's proprietary authority  scores, domain authority and page authority  PA and DA . Because Google's  PageRank has been diluted by changes to the algorithm and is rarely updated,  PageRank simply isn't that great a determinant of ranking power any longer.  Domain authority and page authority are better indicators of the relative power of a  link. The screenshot below shows a sample Open Site Explorer report. Note, the PA  and DA columns, PA and DA are calculated on a scale of 1 to 100:  Keep in mind that Open Site Explorer is also a great link prospecting tool. The PA  and DA values are great indicators of the value of a potential link. Now, let's turn to  building some links.  [ 155 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Securing links through link directories Now that we have covered ideas and concepts surrounding link building, and  learned about how to measure your link building efforts, we will now turn to   the hard work: getting links.  A standard tool in the link builder's arsenal is to secure links through link directories.  A link directory is a website that is wholly devoted to categorized lists of links to  other websites. The Yahoo! directory  now defunct , the Open Directory Project   DMOZ , and business.com are examples of large established directories, but there  are tens of thousands of smaller general, local, and niche directories throughout the  world upon which free links are available simply by applying. Before you begin  building links with directories, be warned: if you overuse this technique or get links  from poor quality directories, you are risking harm to your rankings. We'll outline  some best practices.  Link directories were very popular and effective until a few years ago and were once  ubiquitious in the world of link building. More recently, however, search engines tend  to treat most link directories as link farms. What you want to seek out is only the most  premium quality general directories  directories dedicated to all topics , medium to  high-quality niche directories, and medium to high-quality local directories.  Similar to any link building effort, making an evaluation of the directory is important  before submitting your links. A quick review of any link directory will reveal if the  directory has dangerously low standards. Avoid any directories that are polluted  with trash links like online gambling, online pharmacies, and so on.  Building links with super directories – BOTW  and DMOZ There are a handful of directories that by their age and reputation represent  tremendously valuable link opportunities. The three most important directories are  the Open Directory Project, which operates the directory at http:  www.dmoz.org,  Best of the Web, which operates the directory at http:  botw.org, and http:   business.com, which we don't recommend.  The king of all general directories is http:  www.dmoz.org. DMOZ, as it is  familiarly known, is often discussed in professional SEO circles if for no other   reason, than for the fact that it's nearly impossible to obtain a link within it.   A DMOZ directory listing is one of the best free links a webmaster can get.  [ 156 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   DMOZ can be frustrating. The directory is human-edited by volunteer editors.  One editor might have the responsibility for only one category, or for dozens. For  whatever reason, DMOZ often behaves as if it isn't staffed at all. It is common to  hear of webmasters submitting their site periodically for years and never gaining  admission. There are also rumors of DMOZ being corrupted by self-interested  editors who don't allow admission to websites that compete with their own.  The best advice for webmasters seeking to gain a listing in DMOZ is to submit your  site using the suggest URL link  faithfully adhering to the submission guidelines   every six months and no sooner. Making repetitive submissions will only hurt   your cause.  Best of the Web has operated a general directory at http:  botw.org since 1994.  Best of the Web offers strong link power, but is a paid listing. Current pricing is   $149 a year, or $299 for a lifetime listing.  Best of Web offers a 50 percent discount on its listing fees twice a  year. On or about April 20 of each year, they offer the discount to  celebrate the anniversary of their founding, and in early December.  Follow @botw on Twitter to be alerted to the discount.  Best of the Web is a sound, high-quality link, definitely worthwhile if you can get   the discount.  Business.com operates a general directory at http:  www.business.com  directory . Business.com touts itself as a valuable directory, but the way the site  generates URLs, most directory pages on http:  business.com are not indexed   by Google.  Before you pursue a directory link, make sure the page upon which  your link will be placed is indexed by Google. If the page isn't indexed,  your link will be useless. Even some pages on DMOZ  usually pages  deep within the category structure  are not indexed by Google. To  determine if a page is indexed in Google, use the site: operator when  making a query at Google.com, as site:www.dmoz.org Business . If this query does not return a page or pages in Google search results,  then the page is not indexed, and a link on that page is worthless and  not worth pursuing.  [ 157 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building links with mid-tier general directories There are a few mid-level general directories that can still deliver some ranking  power. Typically, they are 10 years old or more and are human-edited directories— Google has pointed to this factor being important. There are only handfuls that   are worthwhile:     http:  www.joeant.com gimpsy.com    http:  www.skaffe.com     webworldindex.com    http:  www.avivadirectory.com     http:  incrawler.com     http:  www.dirjournal.com     http:  www.findelio.com   Building links with niche directories Niche directories are link directories that include links solely within a common  category. A perfect example is hg.org attorney , a directory serving solely  lawyers and law firms. A niche directory offers some advantages to a webmaster  seeking links. First, general directories have no focused category, so a search  engine will never treat a link as a link in a particular category. On the other hand,  niche directories are by definition focused on a category, so a search engine has no  difficulty determining the category. Furthermore, niche directories tend to be less  spammy than general directories: general directories are immediately a suspect  because they typically grant a link to any website.  Determining if a niche directory offers a high-quality link requires that you apply  some analysis. The first test is probably the only one you need: is the directory  offering high-quality links generally and not allowing spammy links? If so, it is  probably a good prospect for a link. You can look for a PageRank of 4 or above and  a Moz domain authority score of 35 or better, maybe a bit lower if links are hard to  come by.  [ 158 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building links with regional directories Regional directories are simply business directories devoted to a particular city or  region. Every city in the United States has dozens of them, you simply need to do  a little querying to find a few key prospects. Let us use St. Louis as an example. A  query for St. Louis business directory yields some promising results, like stltoday. com places. Applying some analysis yields some very good signals: the site  is operated by a magazine, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. It's a good sign when a  directory is operated and maintained by a media outlet. A whois.net  https:   whois.net   search of the domain reveals that the domain was first registered in  1993—another great quality signal. The Moz domain authority of the site is a lofty 87,  which is spectacular. However, a review of a few random business listings within the  directory reveals that the links in business profiles are image links and do not offer  anchor text, which is a negative. In this case, the positives greatly outweigh the lack  of anchor text and the link is certainly worth pursuing.  Building links with article submission sites  and directories The prior edition of this book recommended link building through article submission  websites. This technique, while effective years ago, is no longer a sound links  building practice. Google has warned about this technique. In fact, if you have  inbound links on article submission sites from years ago, it's a sound practice to  remove those links. Even premium article sites like Squidoo and HubPages now  deliver no ranking power.  Building links with infographics An infographic, as the name implies, is a visual image or series of images, such as  charts or diagrams used to represent information or data. Infographics are powerful  link-building tools. Your goal with an infographic is to entice other webmasters to  link to your infographic. Ideally, the sites that link to your infographic will share  your niche category, which lends even more power to the links you'll garner. In a  circumstance where your infographic goes viral, you can earn hundreds of links.  But be warned, an infographic is a very serious investment in time and money. The  reward, however, is substantial and goes to the heart of a basic principle of link- building: the goal of link building is to secure links in greater numbers and of greater  quality than your competitors. Anyone can get directory links, and so everybody  does. But an infographic is an example of how extra effort translates into higher  quality links, and higher rankings.  [ 159 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing your infographic To develop your infographic, you'll need two things: a set of interesting data, and  a talented graphic designer to format the data into a visual representation. The first  thing to do is to visit http:  visual.ly, a website dedicated to the promotion and  sharing of infographics, to get a feel for how infographics are put together and what  makes a successful one. At visual.ly, you can sort by popularity to see what content  is connecting with users. You can also hire an infographic designer through the site.  Generally, infographics feature a data set and some statistical analysis, such as the  infographic that displays countries with the most threatened mammals. But other  infographics take a more creative approach, such as the infographic featuring the   100 most iconic wedding dresses of all time. You can see both of these examples   at http:  visual.ly 100-most-iconic-wedding-dresses-all-time and  http:  visual.ly map-countries-most-threatened-mammals.  The real magic trick with infographics is to design them so that the topic area is of  interest to webmasters in the same category as your website. That way, any social  media buzz or links that you acquire will generate more traffic and ranking power  for your site.  Promoting your infographic Even a moderately successful infographic can go viral and bring a few dozen   high-quality backlinks. Creating an infographic—as much work as that is—only  gets you halfway there. If you cleverly promote your infographic, you can greatly  increase your chances of going viral and generating higher numbers of backlinks.   We know because we've done a fair amount of infographic development here   at my SEO company, TastyPlacement.  Understanding the quid pro quo of infographics The name of the game in infographic promotion is that a webmaster gets to display  your hard-earned content  the infographic , and in return, you earn a backlink  from the website displaying the infographic. A preliminary task in promoting your  infographic is to place your infographic where it is easy to find, and in a manner that  is easy for webmasters to employ.  [ 160 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up your infographic home First, pick a home for your infographic—this ideally should be the same site to which  you want to send your backlinks. Your home location will house the infographic  itself  1,000 pixels wide is fairly standard , and ideally an on-page display version for  the page itself, for faster loading and easier visibility on a typical webpage  about 540  or 600 pixels wide , a mini-thumbnail for Facebook shares  more on this in a minute   and of course, your recommended embed code  so webmasters can make an easy  insertion of the infographic on their website .  Your embed code should be dead easy for any webmaster to simply grab in a block.  The embed code should be simple html, and should contain the entire package for  the infographic: the on page display version, a link to the full infographic, as well as  the author attribution and your desired links.  Here's an example of an embed code that we used to promote one of our infographics:    <a href="https:  www.tastyplacement.com wp-content uploads Logo-and- Font-Color-Infographic-Full.jpg"> <img src="https:  www.tastyplacement.com wp-content uploads Logo-and- Font-Color-Infographic-Reduced.jpg" alt="Fonts & Colors Infographic"   >  Infographic authored by TastyPlacement, <a href="https:  www. tastyplacement.com ">an Austin SEO and web design agency . To  view the original post, <a href="https:  www.tastyplacement.com  infographic-fonts-colors-logos">click here .    When we promote infographics, we host the preview image and the full  infographic—it's just too complicated to ask webmasters to download the  infographic, install it on their site, then update all the links. By hosting the images,  you make it easy and idiot proof. Because we are hosting the infographic, and the  files are large, we create our infographics in jpeg format: this allows us to compress  the file down for faster loading and less bandwidth usage.  To see all these elements coming together on a proper infographic home, see the  page we've set up for our Austin Startup Scene infographic here: https:  www. tastyplacement.com start-up-infographic.  [ 161 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Including a Facebook-Ready Thumbnail You will also notice another element on that page: a square thumbnail of the  infographic at the bottom of the page. We added that thumbnail to our infographic  page after we learned that when someone posts a share link on Facebook, Facebook  will search the page for roughly square-shaped images to offer as a thumbnail choice  to represent the share. Because infographics tend to be very tall images, Facebook  won't generate a thumbnail from the full infographic. You have to   hand-feed an agreeably sized thumbnail.  Promoting your infographic by making it searchable With our infographic set up and set to share, you want to make sure your  infographic can be easily found in the search engines. Make sure you've got the  terms free and infographic in your title tag and body copy. Free infographic is searched  2,900 times a month in Google, as reported by the Adwords keyword tool.  Promoting through social media Promote your infographic through your Twitter account with free infographic  hash tags. Include a shortened URL with a link to your infographic home. You  should also post a link to your personal and business Facebook pages. We think it's  OK to re-promote an infographic to social media every few weeks.  Promoting through infographic visual graphic  directories We promote our infographics through infographic and visual graphic directories.  These directories exist for the purpose of displaying and housing infographics. You'll  get a mix of dofollow and nofollow links from these directories, and you'll get the  chance for webmasters to find you there. Below is the list of sites we employ  visual. ly is easily the most popular and authoritative of this group :     http:  www.infographicsarchive.com submit-infographics    http:  submitinfographics.com    http:  infographicsite.com submit-infographic    http:  visual.ly    http:  reddit.com r infographics    http:  www.nerdgraph.com submit-infographic    http:  www.infographiclove.com  this is a paid submission   [ 162 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   To find more locations for submission, try a Google search for  keep the quotes   "Submit Your Infographic". That query will yield sites with infographic  submission forms.  Using Specialized Searches to Find Bloggers and  Webmasters If you really want to take your infographic promotion to the next level, you can do a  little curation of specific websites. This technique is going to take a bit more time, but  will generate the highest value links.  First, let us search for existing sites that display infographics. It makes sense that a  webmaster that already displays infographics would probably post another in the  same topic area. For our sleep infographic, we think our content would be valuable  to sleep doctors. So we enter a Google query as follows: sleep doctor infographic.  This query led us to a few sleep doctors and mattress and pillow manufacturers that  already display infographics. One mattress manufacturer has an active blog with  a PageRank of 4. We'd like to get a link on that site, so the next step is to write an  e-mail to that webmaster. So, we wrote the following message:  "Hi, we were browsing the site __________.org, and we notice  you display Infographics for your readers. We have a useful  Infographic on sleep science, that you can display for free  on your site. We've already coded the HTML, so all you would  need to do is paste in the code to your website. You can  find the Infographic here: [link to infographic page embed  code].If you have any questions about how to post the Infographic  on your site, please let me know. "  If your infographic is attractive and useful to readers, you should have no trouble in  ultimately generating hundreds of links.  [ 163 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Link building by commenting on blogs  and forums Commenting on blogs and posting on forums are two good ways to get backlinks to  your website, but you need to be careful to adhere to the proper etiquette and never  overuse this technique. If you start spamming blogs and forums with worthless  comments, it won't get you anywhere because most of these sites are moderated and  your comment will be deleted, along with your link.  Commenting on blogs Blog commenting is a popular strategy for link building, but there is some debate  in the SEO community about whether links from nofollow blogs are counted or not.  If you want to be sure that your link carries weight, then you need to find dofollow  blogs for blog commenting. The easiest way to do this is to look for telltale footprints  that are frequently found on dofollow blogs.  An example of this is the U Comment I Follow logo. Website owners who display  this image on their site are making it known that they have modified their sites to  use dofollow links in the comments. The easiest way to find these sites is to search  for U Comment I Follow in Google images. You can also search for the filenames  u-comment-i-follow.jpg or u-comment-i-follow.gif. To narrow the results  down a bit, try adding your keyword to the search phrase.  There are also many lists of dofollow blogs online, which you can find by searching  for dofollow blogs or dofollow blogs list. Some of these sites are more up-to-date  than others, so you may have to look through several of them before you find a  good list. Many of the sites that get put on these lists end up getting hammered with  comment spam and convert their blogs back to nofollow.  Commenting for good, not for evil When using blog commenting to get links, you should never spam. Always read the  post and make a useful, thoughtful comment that is directly related to the post. Blog  comments should always be about the post, never about you. If you try to sell yourself  or your site in a blog comment, it is likely to be deleted. Your comment needs to say  something more than Thanks! or Great post. Generic comments like these are frequently  left by spammers and experienced bloggers will delete them immediately.  Pay attention to spelling and grammar when writing your comment. People who  read the post and find it valuable will often read through the comments too. If they  find your comment helpful, they might click through to your website. Your comment  is the reader's first impression of you and your site, so make it a good one.  [ 164 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There is some disagreement among website owners about whether it is acceptable  etiquette to use your keyword phrase in the name field so that you will get the  anchor text you want. Some bloggers delete these comments, while others allow  them. You can usually get a good idea of whether it is acceptable on a certain blog by  checking to see whether there are other comments published that use keywords in  place of a name.  Make sure you use the URL field for your link. Don't paste it directly into the comment  text box. This is usually viewed as spam. However, if you are linking to a specific  article and explain how it is relevant, it may be considered acceptable. Whatever you  do, don't comment on several posts on one site at the same time. This will almost  undoubtedly be viewed as comment spam and all of your links will be deleted.  Building links through direct link  requests Getting other websites to link to your site is an essential part of the link building  process. You need to find other sites in the same niche as yours to link to you,  because this makes it appear that your site has built up some trust among other  website owners and it helps build authority with the search engines. However, there  are right and wrong ways to go about asking for links. Here are some tips to help  you get it right.  Asking for links from the sites in your niche Don't write to completely unrelated sites asking for links. Would you want links to  a beekeeping site on your weight loss site? Most website owners want to link only  to content that they feel will be valuable to their readers. For this reason, you should  only request links from related sites. You can find other sites in your niche easily  enough. Just type one of your main keyword phrases into Google. Yes, these sites are  your competition, but they are also potential sources of links.  [ 165 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Telling webmasters why they should link to  you When asking for a link, tell the owner of the site where your site is and why it will  provide value to the other site's readers. Suggest a specific URL that you would  like the owner to link to, and that will contain the content that provides useful  information for his or her readers. Also, make sure your site itself is a quality site.  You will have a hard time getting links if your website is all ads and rewritten  content. Create something worth linking to.  Requesting links from vendors A great source for direct link requests that site owners often overlook is from the  vendors that supply goods and services to your business. If you are a customer of  another business  especially a dealer for a particular product , then a link request  is perfectly reasonable. Links from manufacturer sites can also send website traffic  from customers looking for local dealers of that particular product.  Reciprocal linking – is it dead? A controversial topic in the link building is the reciprocal linking. Reciprocal linking  refers to the practice of exchanging links directly with another webmaster. It was an  early form of building links and while most participants were well intentioned, the  practice grew into a source of spam, link farms, and even automated reciprocal link  pages. To be sure, reciprocal linking is fairly easy for search engines to detect and so  fairly easy to discount within a search algorithm. Google has issued some guidance  on this topic. Google warns against Excessive link exchanges  "Link to me and I'll link to  you"  or partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking. What constitutes excessive?  Google doesn't say, but 10 to 20 links is probably the upper limit of what is safe.  In order to circumvent the obvious problem of detection by search engines,  enterprising link builders crafted even more complex reciprocal linking schemes  such as three-way links  site A links to site B, site B links to site C, and site C in turn  links to site A  and even four-way cross linking. These schemes were too much work  to be practical in the everyday world, so they tended to be used within networks of  sites owned by one individual or company. These multi-party link schemes are seen  as far more reprehensible and worthless in the eyes of search engines than simple  reciprocal linking. As such, if detected, these multi-party schemes are almost certain  to result in a ranking penalty. Do not be lured into these arrangements.  [ 166 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Simple reciprocal linking is never likely to bring any substantial penalties unless  abused, but is never going to bring substantial ranking power. It should also never  be used as a principal means of link building. It should only be used as a supplement  to a broad-based link building program. The best approach to reciprocal links is to  ask would my customers and visitors really find this link of use? If the answer is yes, then  a reciprocal link might be appropriate.  Building links by creating link bait Link bait is a term used to describe an article, feature, picture, post, or page that is so  good that it attracts links naturally from all over the Web, and certainly infographics  fall under the umbrella of link bait. If you've ever read an article that was so useful  that you felt the need to not only add it to your browser's bookmarks, but also  stumble it, tweet it, and share it on Facebook, then you'll understand the power a  great article can have to attract links. That is link bait.  Building link bait is not an easy task, but it will bring in an incredible amount of  traffic and links if you can get it right. You can start by brainstorming to come up  with ideas for content that would appeal to many readers and make them want to  share it with others. Here are some types of pages that seem to attract a lot of links.  Resource lists If you compile a list of all of the best resources in your industry, you're likely to get  some attention from the owners of the websites you include on your list. They may  link to your resource page, which will start to get the word out about it so that it  attracts even more links. Top 10 lists are probably the most popular of this sort of  link bait, that is, Top Ten WordPress Plugins for Business Bloggers.  Sharing a humorous story or article People love to laugh, and if you can make them laugh, they will tell others about  you. Try to think of a funny story that you can relate to with respect to the topic of  your website. Funny stories and jokes probably get passed on and shared more than  any other type of content. Another option is to post a funny picture or cartoon.  Writing about current events Try to find a way to tie the topic of your website into a popular news story, and  you might attract some links from other blogs, especially if you are one of the first  bloggers to jump on the story.  [ 167 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Writing something controversial If you don't mind being in the line of fire, you can get plenty of attention on the  Internet by writing a controversial article. If you are the one to start the discussion, you  will get links from both the sides—those who agree with you and those who disagree.  Interviewing an expert Everyone wants to hear what the experts have to say. This tactic will attract links  from other bloggers who want to comment on what the expert says in the interview.  You'll also get links from the people who learn something from the interview and  want to share it with everyone else, and the expert gets the benefit of some free  publicity, so they are most likely to accept your request.  Giving something away Giving something away is a great way to attract links, but the item you are giving  away must be worth linking to. It could be a free WordPress theme or plugin or  some type of software. It could also be a product that has a substantial value, such  as a laptop or other high-priced gadget. If you use a physical product, you can give  people entries in the give-away for doing things, like tweeting about the contest and  including the URL. Generally, you'll find that the more expensive the product is, the  more links you will get.  Testing something Do you have a theory about something that has yet to be tested? Do the testing  yourself and publish your results. Other people who are interested in your niche  will link to your page because it contains fresh, new information. Include images or  graphs to illustrate your results and make your page more attractive. Review sites— sites that entirely comprise reviews of consumer products—rely on this technique  almost exclusively.  Developing How-to Information Information that tells people how to do something is always in demand. If you can  explain things with clear, step-by-step instructions, people who benefit from your  instructions will pass them on. For even better results, create a series of articles on  the topic or a complete guide that shows every step of the process.  [ 168 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating video content A good video can attract a lot of attention and a lot of links. Try to combine the use  of video with one of the other tactics for best results. For example, make the video  funny or use it to show someone how to do something, rather than trying to explain  it with text and images. Better yet, do it both ways. Then people who have slower  Internet connections won't feel left out if they are unable to watch the video. Check  out the Will it Blend series of viral videos—that company built an entire national viral  web campaign with the great idea of putting things like iPods and golf balls into a  blender and broadcasting the results in short video clips online.  Creating quizzes A good quiz can qualify as link bait too. You can either make your quiz interactive or  put an answer key at the bottom to help people figure out what kind of wife they are  or what Game of Thrones character they like the most. You can come up with a quiz  for just about anything.  Using a catchy title No matter what type of content you use for link bait, you need to have a catchy title  to attract readers. Try to make your title stand out somehow so that people will  read the article or watch the video. If you have done a good job on the content, they  will want to share it, so try to make it easy for them. Include buttons your visitors  can click on to post on a link to Facebook, Stumbleupon, Digg, and other social  networking platforms.  Examples of effective link bait The best way to understand what constitutes link bait is to take a look at a few  examples. These are pages that have been successful at drawing in links from   all over the Internet. You can get ideas for your own site by looking at what   other people have done.

We learnt about the important history and benchmarks for links: how  search engines came to regard them as important, how search engines measure link  value through PageRank and authority, and how we can harness PageRank for the  greatest possible ranking benefit. We covered the important distinction between  dofollow and nofollow links. We examined how to evaluate and measure our own  link building efforts.  We then undertook the craft of link building itself. We studied how to build links  through link directories and article directories, we covered the premiere directories,  BOTW and DMOZ. We discovered how to secure links through blog comments. We  also covered how to gain links through direct request. Finally, we reviewed some  superb examples of link bait.  Link building is the fuel that powers ranking efforts. While it can represent the  greatest amount of effort you'll be required to commit to your search efforts, it can  be the most rewarding, returning dividend for years. In the next chapter, we'll learn  how to employ social media to extend your marketing reach.  [ 170 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using Social Media  In this chapter, we'll learn how to harness social media to promote your company  or website and supplement your search strategy. Social media is the cutting edge of  search placement: new web properties, new opportunities for placement, and new  patterns of Internet user behavior make this a dynamic area. Just like with natural  search, social media dominance flows from cleverness and hard work. Let's begin by taking a close look at the hype-fueled term social media. Ostensibly, the  term refers to websites and media channels that rely principally upon dissemination,  through social interaction between users. Let us use the term social media with  caution; the definition is shifting quickly and will continue to evolve. For our  purposes, we will, to some extent, bow down to the established definition and learn  about what are considered typical social media web properties, such as Facebook,  MySpace, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, recommendation sharing bookmarking sites  like Digg, StumbleUpon, and similar properties. However, we'll keep an open mind  about what social media really is.  Mastering social media can be elusive. At the core of social media success, is the  same principle that underlies web content creation: you must create something of  interest to other people. When creating content on social platforms like YouTube or  Twitter, if your content flops  and it often will as even experts can attest , you won't  make a big splash, but you'll always have another chance to try again.  In this chapter, we'll learn a wide range of techniques for harnessing social media  outlets and channels, learn which channels are the best routes for particular kinds  of businesses and content, and learn specific tips and tricks for success. We'll begin  with an analysis of what social media really is, and how social sites dovetail with  traditional search. We'll learn about the power of viral content—the true measure of  social media content.  [ 171 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We go in depth and learn soup-to-nuts strategies for harnessing the most   important of social media tools: Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. We will cover  WordPress-specific tools that extend WordPress' functionality into the world of  social media and blur the line between your website and your social media presence.  We will explore how social bookmarking can extend your site's reach and placement  with sites like Technorati, Digg, and StumbleUpon. Finally, we'll look at the  awesome power of video sites and video content. By the end of this chapter, you'll  be able to implement an effective social media strategy to further build out both your  WordPress-based site, as well as, your business generally.  What is a search engine? This heading, What is a search engine? now appears for the second time in this book.  We first examined the question in Chapter 1, Getting Started – SEO Basics. The reason  we have repeated it, is that we now need to extend and re-evaluate our notion of  what constitutes a search engine.  Do we even need search engines as much as we did before? In 2010, Facebook.com  unseated Google as the most visited site on the Web, as measured by total page  views as well as time spent on site. Traditional search engines own a decreasing  slice of total Internet visitors and page views compared to just a few years ago, as  social sites come to the forefront and consume greater proportions of user interest.  Traditional search engines are still massive, without doubt. The social space is  growing rapidly and presence on these alternative properties cannot be ignored. So  yes, any business owner or blogger needs to continue to rely on traditional search  engines for visitors and customers. However, perhaps the better way to think about  social sites is that they are just search engines cast in a different light. Digg and  YouTube are places where users go to find interesting stuff; that's fairly close to the  definition of a traditional search engine. The term search engine optimization is the common label for optimizing a site  to increase the number of user visits and views. However, as we expand our  understanding, the label doesn't fit as neatly. The better way to think of overall  optimization is placement. We will learn in this chapter, to go beyond placement in  search results pages; we'll learn how to enjoy increased placement in a wide variety  of web channels, including user's e-mail inboxes.  [ 172 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Going viral with social media An important concept that permeates all social media is the notion of viral content.  Viral content is a site, page, image, or video that, by its own merits, is so humorous,  interesting, or otherwise noteworthy, that it extends its reach simply by virtue of  being passed on by readers, with no further action by its creator. An example of viral  content is David, the boy captured on video by his father after leaving the dentist. In  the video  if you are one of the few who haven't seen it , a middle school-aged David  demonstrates the woozy effects of really powerful painkillers; he asks, Is this real life?  This video has garnered over 130 million views on YouTube. While this video wasn't  created as a promotion for a business, its tremendous popularity has spawned one:  the boy's family has launched a website  http:  www.davidafterdentist.com ,  that sells a line of t-shirts and stickers based upon the event. That is a demonstration  of the power of viral content.  Viral content is the golden egg of Internet marketing. It represents  free publicity and can positively affect link building and referral  traffic. Viral content and link bait share a common trait: tremendous  user interest. It's not easy to do. You have to generate content that is  far superior to the Internet's many interesting offerings.  Generating viral content will depend on your chosen niche. For example,   http:  www.wreckedexotics.com  enjoys a naturally sensational niche:  photographs of impossibly expensive exotic cars wrecked by hapless owners.   That type of content sells itself. For a local plumber, creating outstanding   content can be far more challenging, and may be nearly impossible.  Video content is particularly suited to going viral. Videos are easy to share  and because they require less effort than reading, are appetizing to viewers.  Bookmarking sites like Digg and StumbleUpon can help spread video content   like wildfire—which is what you want.  Here are some ideas on how to create outstanding viral content:      Just as with link bait, create a valuable and useful list of resources for users.  People love lists, and they frequently get picked up by social bookmarking  sites like Digg and StumbleUpon. They garner plenty of attention, visits, and  inbound links. Lists can work for any industry, that is, Top 10 WordPress  Plug-Ins, or 80 Great Jobs for Recent College Grads.     Create an online quiz. You may have seen many viral quizzes come through   your e-mail inbox or through your Facebook account.  [ 173 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Create a viral interactive video. Another popular type of viral content is  video and animations. These can be as simple as small flash games or as  complex as full videos. A video that teaches users how to do something   upgrade a PC sound card, install anti-virus software, check a dryer vent  for dangerous link build-up, wax a car, so on and so forth , is sure to garner  some interest.     Use photography. Any line of work generates matters of particular interest   from time-to-time. Add an insightful or humorous caption and share the  photographs. The wildly popular Cheezburger Network of sites  http:   icanhascheezburger.com and a few others  is nothing short of an Internet  empire—built entirely from cute and funny photographs. Create a gallery of  free desktop wallpaper images from your creations.         Create an online tool. Online web-based tools are very popular. Tools like  mortgage calculators and budgeting tools are very popular online. If you  don't know how to program, you can turn to Craigslist and post in the gigs  section for small programming jobs. Issue a press release. Press releases are great ways to get links, spread the word  about your company, and go viral. Because press releases are distributed so  widely, you get a real head start on distribution that you just can't achieve  with just your website. Most press releases will wind up appearing on at least  a few dozen websites just through natural distribution. There are dozens of  both free and paid press release services, among them, PR.com  http:  www. pr.com   and Free-Press-Release.com  http:  www.free-press-release. com  . Pay a little extra to include a link in your press release and your link will  be duplicated by most sites that republish the press release.  Learning to build your personal authority As you work within social media to build your business, blog, or personal brand,  you want to think about the idea of personal authority. Google+, Facebook, and  other social media sites like activity: check-ins, friending, following, liking, starring,  directions, posting photos, using GPS, and so on. There is no substitute for being  a real person doing real things online. Just about anything you do on Google+,  Facebook, Google Maps, and on other sites can help your presence online. The power  an individual profile enjoys is referred to as authority. The more you use your online  presence, the more authority you develop. Most of the major recent Google patents  speak to the authority of a person interacting with a piece of content  a website, a  map listing, and many others , as a measure of value for that content. Be active, and  you'll gain authority. What follows are some tips you can employ when you interact  in the social media ecosystem:  [ 174 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If your business has a map listing, Google+ activity  is vital Google+ is now fully integrated with Google Maps and has a more powerful impact  on your Google Maps listing for your business. Facebook is great for traffic and  building customer loyalty, but Google+ activity is important for your Maps listing  and for getting your content indexed quickly. If you write a new page or post  on your website, post it to Google+ and the Google spider will follow the link in  minutes, and you can get your content indexed more quickly.  There's another important element to Google+ and that is the series of patents  Google has filed concerning the principal of agent rank. The principal underlying  agent rank is that the author or a person sharing content can render particular  content more authoritative and trustworthy based upon the inherent authority of the  author or sharer. So, content made by a more valued author would tend to appear  higher in search results. We saw an early invocation of this principle in 2011 to 2013,  when Google was displaying small author photos next to entries in its search results.  Google then abruptly discontinued the practice.  Google continues to file patents related to the principle of agent rank, but has not  fully integrated agent rank into its algorithm. If you want to read some meaningful  and in-depth analysis of Google patents, the leading commentator on this topic   is Bill Slawski, who operates the blog SEO by the Sea, which you can find here:  http:  www.seobythesea.com. Certainly, individual personal authority will   play an increasing role in search results for years to come.  Make friends Easy; make friends and connections on all social networks: it expands the reach   of your content and raises the authority of your profile. It can also lead to links   for your content.  Post photos, then share If you ever need to share a photo with someone, don't email it—post it to Google+,  Facebook, or Pinterest and then share the link with whomever you want. That sends  your friends to your Google+, Facebook or Pinterest profile, which these sites see  as activity. It's free storage for your photos and you can share entire albums or just  individual photos. Again, it increases authority and generates activity and you can  post photos to your personal Google+ page or to your Business Google+ page. If it's  relevant, post photos to your business page and then share on your personal page.  [ 175 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When you post a photo to your business page, you can track the amount of  impressions your photo gets very easily within Google+. Click on Photo Details to  the right of the photo and views can be found underneath.  Use Google Maps to get directions to your business This is a power tip for businesses that rely on Google Map listings. This is the  subject of a recent Google Patent: customers request directions is a quality signal  for a business and also demonstrates that your business is open. When anyone  requests directions to your business, that metric is tracked by Google. You  and your  customers  can either use the desktop directions or phone-based directions.  Don't go crazy doing one thing Keep it natural: don't just get directions on Google Maps business dozens of times  without getting reviews, likes, and posting photos to your business and personal  pages; it doesn't look natural when a business has 90 reviews, yet no one EVER  requests directions. You want a natural mix of activities in your personal social   space and your business social space.  Review lots of things You can review any business in Google Maps or Google Plus, and it helps increase  the authority of your personal profile—again, the authority of your personal listing  means Google sees you as a real person. It also puts your face name in the review  section, permanently, for the business you review, so other customers see your  picture and profile—they might click on your profile and follow you.  Activity engenders activity This is important: the more active you are in social media, the more you appear  in other's feeds and on business pages; these social media systems are designed  to create little viral swirls of activity around actions people take online. Just one  example of hundreds: you post a comment to a clever post on a funny news article  that one of your contacts posts—now all of those person's contacts see your activity.  They might visit follow.  There really is no bad activity, just have fun It's really hard to screw this up because all you need to do, in a sense, is show up at  the party. Don't worry about is this article I am posting to my Google+ page relevant to  my business niche? Sure, some content needs to be relevant, but anything interesting is  better than nothing.  [ 176 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Favorite stuff star stuff On a Google Maps page, there is a star that you can click—the star turns yellow.  This stores the Maps entry to My Places  Starred. You can also add a Facebook  business page to your list of Favorites. Why not add your business page to your list  of personal favorites?  Using LinkedIn to promote your business  or website When it comes to making only business contacts to increase your company's brand,  no other social networking site is as valuable as LinkedIn. This is because LinkedIn  was created initially as a business networking tool. And today, that is exactly what it  continues to be.  The core purpose of LinkedIn is to give its users the opportunity to build and grow  business contacts. And with over 80 million members and growing, the contacts  your business can make are limitless. One tip for gaining contacts is as simple as  joining groups in the same industry in which your company does business. And as  you contribute to the group in discussions, you'd be surprised at how many contacts  you'll gain. This will expose your company to a bigger and wider audience.  Setting up your company on LinkedIn is a fairly simple process, but in order to get  started the right way it is imperative to follow every step precisely. The first thing  you need to know about LinkedIn is that a user's account page is known as a profile,  not a page like the other social networking sites. It's a lot more professional to refer a  potential client customer to your company's profile, instead of your company's page.  To create your company's profile, you will need to provide your company's  registered e-mail domain. Your company's registered e-mail domain is the unique  name right after the @ sign; for example, @companyname.com. General e-mail domains  will not be accepted, and this pertains to e-mail domains for such e-mail providers  as Yahoo!, Google, AOL, and so on. The e-mail domain must be unique to your  company. And it's worth noting that the only people who can create the company  profile are current employees.  [ 177 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When you're all set to create your company profile, follow these simple steps to  accomplish the task. To add a company profile for your business, you must do   the following:  1.  Click on Interests, then Companies at the top navigation bar of your   LinkedIn home page.  2.  Click on the Create button located in the lower-right section of the page. 3.  Type in the full name of your company and your company's e-mail address   on the Add a Company page.  4.  Confirm your company's e-mail address by clicking on the link that LinkedIn  sends you via e-mail. After clicking on the link, all that's required to confirm  your company's e-mail address is to log in with your current primary e-mail  address.  After your company's e-mail address is confirmed, LinkedIn will direct you to the  Create a Company page. Here, you will be given the opportunity to input details  and information about your business. This step is crucial; it is your opportunity to  give your company a winning description. Once completed, just click on Create a  Company to finalize the process. And if you desire to have your company logo on  your business profile, click on browse to locate your company logo and click on  upload. LinkedIn requires that your company logo be 300 x 300 pixels in PNG, JPG,  or GIF format; 4 Mb is the maximum size allowed.  Expert tip: Keep thumbnails ready! Many forum sites, social networking sites, press release distribution  channels, online profiles, business networking sites, and social  bookmarking websites allow you to upload avatar thumbnail  images representing you or your company. Create a set of  professional-looking thumbnails representing your brand in typical  sizes  80 pixels by 80 pixels, 120 pixels by 120 pixels  and keep them  all ready in an easy-to-locate directory on all your computers. You  won't be scrambling for a thumbnail, when you add profiles to a  website.  Many business owners hesitate to get started with making contacts after setting  up their company profile. It is wiser to begin networking as soon as your company  profile is completed. And don't worry if you don't connect with hundreds of contacts  right away. This is networking, and with any form of networking, making the right  connections takes effort and a good amount of time.  [ 178 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The following are a few tips and tricks to build high numbers of valuable contacts on  LinkedIn  but the same principles apply to all social networking sites :         Make sure that your company profile is filled out completely with images,  thumbnails, descriptions, projects, and links. A fully completed company  profile has a much better chance of attracting reputable contacts than an  incomplete company profile. Join groups that have similar interests as your business. This will enable you  to gain more insight into your industry and will also put you in the position  to attract valuable connections. However, remember participation is the key  to developing relationships with the other group members. The main thing is  to circulate and keep your company's name in front of other member's eyes.  If you do this effectively, your contacts will grow exponentially.     Search for business professionals whom you already know. LinkedIn has an  easy, intuitive search feature. Use this method and you'll be surprised by the  results. All you'll need to do when you find other people is simply send them  a message through LinkedIn introducing yourself. They'll respond, and will  be more than happy to add you to their trusted list of contacts.     Browse your contacts' connections. When someone accepts you as a contact,  you gain access to their list of contacts. This is a great feature because maybe  your contacts have connections with people you would like to do business  with. If so, with a couple of mouse clicks, you can get introduced to a  connection. This entails sending a message to the business person you'd like  to do business with, as a trusted associate of the business person's contact.  Use this networking strategy repeatedly and watch how your trusted list of  contacts grows.     Give testimonials for business contacts that you've worked with. Most   likely, the contact will reciprocate, and your profile  which will display on  your company profile  will have itself a valuable testimonial on display.  Testimonials are a great way to build trust on LinkedIn. They are a clear  indicator of your quality of work and professionalism. In a nutshell,  testimonials are valuable additions to your profile. When you send a contact  a testimonial, LinkedIn will ask the contact to approve it, and if the contact  would like to reciprocate.     Start an event. By taking the initiative of starting your own networking event,   it can easily be promoted to your current contacts. You can then ask your  current contacts if any of their contacts would be interested in the event. If  so, ask your contacts to refer you to the interested parties. This will generate  more connections for you and also showcase you as a leader.  [ 179 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Why is LinkedIn so effective for businesses networking? LinkedIn, unlike other  social websites, was designed to be a professional business networking tool. While  millions of people use it as a personal social experiment, the core of LinkedIn is its  business networking platform. Fortune 500 companies are listed, along with top  CEOs and numerous movers and shakers from a wide variety of industries. Chances  are, you value your company's products and services, and LinkedIn provides the  opportunity to share what you have to offer with countless business professionals,  clients, and potential customers.  Here are a few specific tips for promoting your business on LinkedIn:     Create a short newsletter for your LinkedIn contacts to inform them of your  company's products and or services, post it to your LinkedIn feed to share  with your contacts.     Send messages to your LinkedIn contacts that you've targeted as potential   customers, with your current sales specials, coupons, and discounts.     Add value to your company profile by posting your presentations on your   company's profile. This can be done by using a presentation application.     Purchase a LinkedIn direct ad that will only be visible by your target market.  The power of LinkedIn's advertising is that you can focus demographically,  with great precision, only on those viewers that interest you.     Offer recommendations to people you know or people you have done   business with. This method will give you valuable exposure on their profile.  Theoretically, people to whom you give recommendations will return the  favor. The more recommendations that you accumulate, the greater the  chance you will have that people will want to do business with you.     Customize your LinkedIn URL. There's a good chance that your company   profile may be indexed by the search engines, and LinkedIn profiles actually  receive a high rank on Google. LinkedIn provides a default URL on sign-up,  but instead of using the default, customize the URL with your company's  name. However, if your company is a recent start-up, it may serve you better  to use a great keyword that describes your business.     Use your customized LinkedIn URL to your advantage, by using it as your  signature when you leave comments on blogs or business-related websites.  As you can see, LinkedIn is a fully interconnected network that can demand a lot  of time in order to achieve success. One person may be able to manage a company  profile, but the required time may become a challenge. To avoid this, see if three to  four employees can take turns updating and maintaining the profile, under your  supervision. Maybe offer an incentive to the employees who are willing to assist with  this endeavor.  [ 180 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Another benefit to having a company profile on LinkedIn is being able to post  available jobs on your profile. Once you have a sizable list of trusted business contacts,  you can ask your connections to refer qualified candidates to you. It can't get easier  than that for sourcing great applicants for available positions. It doesn't matter if  your company's needs are for customer service reps, sales personnel, engineers, or IT  professionals; LinkedIn members are a very diverse group of professionals.  Microblogging with Twitter for business Twitter is a tremendously popular site that can generate significant numbers of  traffic and followers. Twitter is woven into the landscape of the web; hundreds of  millions of people use Twitter on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and even  on smart watches.  Microblogging allows users to communicate updates, opinions, news, reviews, and  more in short bursts of information. Internet tools like Twitter help businesses and  companies to capture the attention of their customers immediately. Donald Trump  recently commented on Twitter calling it fantastic … like owning a newspaper  without the losses.  The proliferation of Twitter-enabled smartphones has extended the reach of this  important tool. Keep in mind, that Twitter messages are indexed by search engines.  Consequently, Twitter messages can yield search traffic independently from   your website.  Employing Twitter for your business Twitter is one of the most widely accessible and reliable blogging tools on the  Internet today. In fact, Twitter enjoyed 302 million active users in March of 2015  according to Statistics. In April 2010, around the time of the first edition of this book,  it was reported that there were 17 million active users of Twitter. Twitter has helped  many small businesses to market their products and services without cost. Twitter  differs from traditional blogs, as Twitter only allows 140 characters per message. So  your Tweets must be short and sweet. The advantage to a tweet is the immediacy of  the contact with your circle of influence and the amount of people you can connect  with in the space of a minute or two.  Even if you are a beginner or engaging with Twitter for the first time, what matters  is your ability to succinctly offer tidbits of information to the Twitter community and  offer your products and services to them in an interesting and alluring way, without  being overbearing. Do not make the mistake of aggressively advertising your  products or services right off the bat. Make sure you introduce yourself and begin to  connect with others before announcing your business services or products.  [ 181 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   One benefit that Twitter offers is the opportunity to network with other users who  have similar interests. For every person you chat with through Twitter, your exposure  through page links and social marketing strategies can expose your business to a  circle of followers, 10 times the size of your original group of friends or followers.  Networking with others who have similar business goals and strategies will help to  introduce new and exciting ideas and concepts for your business, as well as opening  up the possibility of mutual cooperation on compatible projects. Twitter not only  helps to facilitate new relationships, but it also helps to solidify current working  relationships. If you take a moment to design an effective marketing plan for using  Twitter, the level of exposure your business gains will increase exponentially.  How to get people to follow you on Twitter The most important rule is to publish information worth reading. As the owner of  your business, you have a certain level of expertise to offer your customers. It may be  expertise in clothing, traveling, health, or finance. If you offer your followers useful,  interesting, and reliable information, they will be much more likely to continue to  follow you and may even click on any links you include in your tweet. You'll also  want to create a follow me on Twitter link on your website or blog, so that your  customers can easily choose to follow you on Twitter. You can also gain Twitter  followers by following other users—some users will reciprocate by following your  Twitter feed.  As with most social media marketing, the key is to gain contacts. In the case of Twitter,  a simple way to begin to get followers is to put an invitation on your blog for people to  follow you on Twitter. As a follower of yours, they can get a quick notification every  time the blog is updated. This will be convenient for your readers, because they won't  have to keep checking your blog to see if you have added new content.  You can advertise your Twitter account and blog in a variety of online forums  and large social networking sites such as Facebook. Remember to provide useful  information to your followers on your blog or website, and update your Twitter  followers each time you post an article on your site or profile page.  Twitter has proven to be an effective way to establish a strong brand loyalty. Twitter  allows you to recover previous readers of your blog by reconnecting with them  as followers on Twitter. You can also post brief tweets to remind your friends or  followers of new content on your website. Reminder tweets are much more effective  than RSS feeds, because they are so immediate, and are pushed to readers, rather than  requiring the reader's intervention.  [ 182 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using Twitterfeed to automatically update  your followers of new blog posts Twitterfeed is a third-party application that will extend the functionality of your  WordPress website to push new content automatically to your Twitter followers.  It works by taking your WordPress RSS feed, parsing the title, and creating a   Twitter post. In order to use Twitterfeed, you need to sign up for a free account at  http:  www.twitterfeed.com. Then you can configure your Twitterfeed account,  to automatically update your Twitter account with posts featuring new content you  post to your WordPress site.  Top tips for using Twitter for business Share links to interesting sites and events in your industry:     Talk about non-business topics, too.    Don't answer the question what you are doing?; answer the question what      Get your employees to join in and post to Twitter. This will vary the tone and   has your attention?"  topics of your feed naturally.     When promoting a blog post, summarize it, don't just dump a link.    Ask for opinions.    Follow influential twitterers, and follow people that follow them.    Use Twitter Search to see who is talking about you.    Use free URL shortening tools like Bit.ly and TinyURL to keep links short.    When in doubt, re-tweet what others have posted.    Don't rely on Twitter alone; it's a supplement, not a principal strategy.  Using Twitter to promote your business Twitter offers many ways to attract new customers to your business and to gain  depth with existing customers. You can influence your target market by building  online visibility and maintaining a presence on Twitter. Twitter can lighten your  marketing budget, reduce the amount of money you need to invest to win new  customers, and engage more deeply with your existing customers.  [ 183 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In order to effectively use Twitter to promote your business, use the social platform  to communicate with your target market. Do not just promote your business, but  communicate with your followers by providing information they want and need.  Increase your level of contact and communication with potential customers and  supporters to make it a two-way street. Listen and respond to what your customers  are saying.  It is important to provide your supporters with the information they are requesting  in a timely fashion. As time goes on, you will develop a reputation in your niche as  a reliable and professional expert. By using Twitter to share your knowledge with  your followers, you can make very effective use of this burgeoning technology.  Consistently offer your readers reliable information and updates. This reliability  and professionalism will build a strong relationship with your followers and lead to  higher profits for your business venture.  People are quite selective when it comes to who they do business with and they often  prefer to do business with someone they know. If done correctly, social networking  gives you the opportunity to learn about your customer's perspectives, and will  enable you to understand the needs they have and the challenges they face. Through  online social networking, you will be able to create a relationship with many people  who will then view you as a resource and an expert in your business niche.  Using social bookmarking sites to  promote your business Social bookmarking sites provide one of the most powerful ways to harness  the power of the Internet, and drive traffic to your websites and blogs. Social  bookmarking sites are sites that empower Internet users to store, organize, and  share websites, and other online resources. A typical social bookmarking site lets  a user store a profile where their favorite website pages are housed. Ideally, the  bookmarking site also allows users to share their favorite properties with other users.  As you promote your business online, one of the most effective ways of driving  customers to your website is through the use of social bookmarking sites.  [ 184 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting started with social bookmarking As you begin to pursue the arena of social bookmarking websites, a great first  step is to visit the main social bookmarking sites such as Reddit, Delicio.us, Digg,  Fark, StumbleUpon, and Technorati. Social bookmarking sites each have some  degree of focus and you'll want to bear this in mind when selecting a site to pursue.  For example, Technorati is focused on technology, while StumbleUpon covers  nearly every topic. As an initial investigation, you can join one or more of these  sites  focus on just a few at first  and begin to regularly submit content at daily  or weekly intervals. On social bookmarking sites, the content you submit will be  links for the most part to other websites of interest along with your comments and  observations. By doing this, you are creating an online presence for yourself in the  online bookmarking community. Incidentally, bookmarking sites are great ways to  find high-quality web pages and content in topic areas that interest you, which is  essentially their purpose.  In order to accurately access the effectiveness of these sites for your particular  business, website, or blog, you have to make sure that you submit new links and  pages. Ideally, your profile on a social bookmarking site will include dozens of  valuable bookmarks to worthwhile websites and pages. You then want to intersperse  with your bookmark collection, links to your own website and pages—you never  want to have a profile consisting solely of links to your own properties unless  your content is truly world class. To do so is not only bad etiquette, but you won't  earn any followers with a completely self-serving profile. Maintaining an active  membership is one of the main keys to enjoying a healthy level of traffic to your site  or blog.  Being an active member confers an obligation to regularly visit the social  bookmarking sites you have joined, in order to contribute bookmarks, comments,  articles, and advice based on the ideas or business that have a particular relevance  to you. By posting regular comments, you are solidifying your online presence in a  certain social bookmarking community. If you reply to the comments made by other  contributors, they will in turn return the favor and comment on your posts. This  means that you will enjoy additional links pointing to your site; some links, but not  all, will be dofollow links.  It is crucial that you offer good, reliable, and expert information in your comments  and posts. This way, your followers will begin to trust your information and will  seek you out via your website or blog, if they have a question about a product or  service, in your field of expertise. Also, you do not want to be perceived as posting  erroneous comments only to get your own links seen and clicked on by others. This  will discredit your reputation as an expert in your niche market.  [ 185 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Choosing a social bookmarking site The most advantageous social bookmarking sites are the sites that people like and  use the most. Your site or blog will move up in the search rankings when more and  more people bookmark your page. A higher ranking for a site with healthy traffic  translates into a steady flow of fresh, targeted visitors. Additionally, because the  social bookmarking sites have become a favorite among bloggers, many people  will write about your website and this will in turn generate more and more traffic  depending on the quality and usefulness of the backlinks you provide.  Social bookmarking sites allow customers the ability to post their favorite sites with  labels, tags, or phrases in order to classify and organize them. The major social  bookmarking sites continually offer some of the best array of content you want to  share with others. For example, Delicio.us is a social bookmarking site that enjoys  a great reputation, due in part to being acquired by Yahoo!. Delicio.us is one of the  most popular of the social bookmarking sites. Some other well-known sites include  Digg, StumbleUpon, Technorati, Blinklist, and Magnolia. Note that these are just a  partial list. Currently, there are over 200 worthwhile social bookmarking sites.  Some bookmarking sites require you to join before you can submit anything, but  others allow you to submit and search the site prior to joining. Some of the sites may  be better suited to your particular business or field. It is a good first step to visit some  of the more popular sites, until you really get the hang of social bookmarking. This  will also give you the opportunity to see what each one of the sites has to offer.  One of the most popular and valuable social bookmarking sites is Reddit.com. One  notable feature, as copied by other social bookmarking sites, lets users vote on each  submitted bookmark. Reddit then ranks bookmarks stories based on the rating each  receives. The votes that an article receives will determine how high or low in the  ranking that it appears. The site also lets users comment on each bookmark.  In choosing a social bookmarking site to promote your business, first recognize that  you may want to employ a variety of social bookmarking sites instead of just one.  Using multiple sites, such as Reddit, Digg, Technorati, StumbleUpon, and others is  the best way to diversify your marketing campaign.  [ 186 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Beginning with social bookmarking sites Before beginning your community participation on any of these sites, you must  complete your profile on each site. Nearly all social bookmarking sites offer a profile  where you can add a URL; employ this feature to develop a complete profile before  you begin to contribute content. Next, select other members with similar interests  and become followers of their profiles and bookmarks; most will reciprocate by  following you. Next, engage with other users by commenting on their submissions.  In turn, those other users will begin to comment on your submissions. Then, you are  off and running!  After creating your profile, search the site and bookmark the sites and pages that you  like  on Reddit, this is called an upvote, on StumbleUpon, this is called a stumble .  Whenever possible, get a friend or business contact to make any initial submission of  your content so that you don't appear fully self-serving. Remember you are creating  an identity and reputation for finding great bookmarks from all over the Internet.  This will encourage others to eventually follow your newer bookmarks.  Promoting your website through social  bookmarking sites Simply put, social bookmarking is the process of selecting and saving the sites  and pages you like in one place, so you don't need to remember the URL. We do  this in our browsers, when we add a page to our favorites or bookmarks. Social  bookmarking sites extend this functionality to include the ability to share and  comment on submissions. With that in mind, here are a few tips to harness   the power of social bookmarking.  Timing is important If you submit your bookmark in the middle of the night, when all of your friends are  asleep, you will get no immediate points or ranking for your bookmark; it will not  drive traffic to your article. The moment you submit, make sure some of your friends  are online, so your bookmark gets a chance to be seen on the front page by other  users who don't know you. When your friends submit bookmarks, make comments,  and reply to the comments made to your bookmarks as soon as possible.  [ 187 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Your ranking matters Traffic to your site or article from these social bookmarking sites usually occurs only  if you make the front page or first few pages of the site, or at least the front page of  a popular category within the site. This high ranking usually doesn't last for long. It  may not last for more than a day.  Submit a catchy headline or title When you submit a bookmark, you will be prompted to submit a title. This doesn't  necessarily mean you have to submit the exact article title. Ideally, you should  submit a title that will attract the attention of your social network; so make it  interesting. Also, include a great description of your first paragraph and make it  attention-getting. Make a unique title for each bookmark.  Remember to choose an appropriate social  bookmarking site for your business Not all social bookmarking sites are the same. Some lean towards political subjects  like Digg, while others lean more towards socializing like Facebook or idiosyncratic  interests like StumbleUpon and Clipmarks. LinkedIn, while essentially a business  social networking tool, does also operate as a social bookmarking site in the business  niche. Choosing the site that matches your business is a fine art and will take you a  long way towards online advertising success.  Remember that social bookmarking websites are  communities These websites are communities. The original intention of social networking and  bookmarking was to create a community, before it became an SEO trick to drive  traffic. When a user joins the community and solely operates to manipulate the  community for profit through self-serving promotion, the community doesn't take  it kindly. These websites are transparent; your intentions will be difficult to hide if  overtly selfish. Join the community first and begin making valuable contributions,  before advertising your business or service. Remember that active, regular  participation counts.  [ 188 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Leveraging Facebook for a business or  blog Facebook is the largest social networking website online today, and has passed  Google as the most viewed site on the Internet. Its popularity is growing  dramatically. Almost everyone is familiar with this website, which underscores the  increasing importance for online business owners to incorporate Facebook as part of  a savvy Internet marketing strategy.  In order to ensure your success, remember that the strength of Facebook is about  connecting with people. If you offer a sense of community and connection through  your Facebook page, people will become involved very quickly and your business  will grow more easily.  Using Facebook to promote a new or existing  business or blog The networking potential of Facebook is enormous in its ability to promote an  existing business or launch a new business or blog. Hundreds of millions of users  visit the site every day, and each user belongs to several groups and networks of  their own. As your online presence on Facebook becomes established, you will be  able to connect with people and organizations that will enjoy and benefit from the  products and services that you offer.  Facebook does require that a code of conduct be followed when using the site to give  exposure to your website. First, you must ensure that your actions do not violate  Facebook's terms of service. You should never spam other Facebook users with  purely commercial messages.  To successfully use Facebook to promote your business or blog, you need to build  your own community around your specific products, services, or profile. For  example, if your site is based around real estate in Napa Valley, focus the content on  your profile on how much you love Napa Valley, how great the real estate is, events  in Napa Valley, or how wonderful the quality of life in Napa Valley is. You can also  create a Facebook group using Napa Valley Real Estate as the focus.  [ 189 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As people learn to trust you and your voice, they are more likely to respond and  choose to use your service or buy your product. If you want to further enhance  your presence on Facebook, you can encourage participation by adding or creating  a variety of applications, where people can attend virtual meetings or cast their  opinions by posting comments to a message board. You can also create a virtual  polling place that will allow group members to discuss issues with each other and  generate more of a connection to what is happening in your network.  Utilizing the full potential of Facebook For sheer scale of user activity, no social media website comes close to Facebook. The  statistics are staggering: Facebook has well over 1 billion active users. It is also clear  that Facebook is not limited to any single age group, indicating the vast potential  marketing scope the site has to offer. One of the most important aspects of using the marketing potential of Facebook, is  to use the site to help brand yourself. Even if your product is boring to the general  population, such as running a bookkeeping service, you can add personal touches  to your Facebook page, to make your service more understandable and interesting  to potential customers. Facebook works optimally when you keep people interested  and involved in what you have to offer. You can do this with groups, applications, or  attract customers who might be interested in you, based on what you have on your  Facebook profile. A Facebook profile or business page can be used effectively as a means to acquire  both new prospects and provide ongoing support to interested parties and existing  customers. To use Facebook as an effective marketing tool, business owners should  be aware of two distinct features of Facebook: the Facebook business page and  Facebook groups.  Using a Facebook business page to promote  your business or blog You should employ a Facebook business page, if you are planning to use Facebook  for business promotion. Doing so will allow you to separate your personal profile  from your business profile. This is a very effective way of recruiting fans  recently  changed to likes, but it means the same thing  who receive updated information  about your company every time you post new information. A business page can  succeed by continually publishing new information, such as articles, upcoming  events, podcasts, blogs, videos, and links to other relevant information that fans  can find important. Your business page should be more of a resource to your fans,  instead of a strictly promotional tool, so that fans will want to continue receiving  updates from you.  [ 190 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Facebook business pages are specifically designed for businesses, professionals,  celebrities, and those who want to promote a business, service, or skill rather than  a personal profile page. Facebook gives business page users the specific choice to  advertise a local business, product or an artist, band, or a public figure. Choose  the design that best suits your business. As you follow the steps in creating your  Facebook business page, you will be prompted to enter your contact information and  other related information. On each Facebook business page, a visiting user has the option of liking your page.  This Facebook fan like option is a great way of generating a system of indirect  references, such as friends of the fans of your page. The fan like option is an easy  way to widen your networking circle immensely and generate lots of exposure to  your business. A careful, creative, and professional design of your Facebook page  goes a long way toward attracting potential customers.  Using a Facebook group to promote your  business or blog When using Facebook in connection with your business, it is important not to  posture yourself, your business, and group pages, as purely commercial—it's a  delicate balance.  People like new ideas and want to know about them. Facebook users want to find  people who share similar interests. If you use the site for commercial purposes,  keep this desire for connection in the forefront of your mind, because it will be what  makes your business venture successful on a social networking site like Facebook.  Along those lines, making a Facebook group page is a strategy that allows people  with a common purpose to build a community. The group can be directly related to  your business or community activity that includes your target market. Again, this  tactic can be effective if the page is updated regularly with content that the group has  an interest in. If you can get your followers more committed, then there is a greater  chance that they will remember your company name, and the products and services  you offer. If you can find a relevant Facebook group that has fallen into neglect, you  can sometimes join the group and jump-start the dialog.  [ 191 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Keep in mind, that a Facebook group is restricted to members of the Facebook  website. The Facebook group, unfortunately, does not come with the same option  as a Facebook business page, but it does allow people to become members of the  group. This greatly reduces the amount of information that can be shared with  other potential customers, although it does allow you to enhance the focus of your  marketing strategy to a very specific audience. Just like the process of setting up your  Facebook business page, Facebook will also lead you through the process of creating  your Facebook group.  Sharing content and connecting with  others on Facebook – useful features and  applications If you are completing a personal profile as well as a Facebook business page, you  want to make sure both profiles are completely filled out. Facebook is a social site  and people want to know you, not just your business. Remember, it's called social  media for a reason; one way to think about how to harness social media is that you  want to effectively extend your personal life into a broader community, while acting  as an ambassador of your business.  When completing your personal profile, be sure to complete not only your contact  information such as e-mail and websites, but also your birthday and where you live.  In addition, take the time to complete the sections on your activities, interests,   and favorites.  Joining groups Find groups that interest you, join them, and participate regularly. Many groups will  allow you to post information about your business, but do not join a group solely for  this purpose. Participate in discussions and provide valuable information. You can  also create your own group. The advantage of joining or creating a group is to meet  people with similar interests and ideas. Join groups not only with your own personal  interests in mind, but also with the interests of your target market as well.  Increasing your circle of friends The more friends you have on Facebook  up to the maximum of 5,000 , the more  people you will be able to reach for either personal or business reasons. There is an  exponential growth in connections that occur naturally on Facebook, so the more  connections you start with, the more you'll end up with.  [ 192 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Start searching for people you know, like people from your school or hometown.  Then add them as friends. If you create articles or other online content, invite your  readers to connect with you by including a link to your Facebook profile at the end of  the article. Include a link to your Facebook profile in your e-mail signature. Do you  belong to any other online groups? If so, send them a message inviting the members  to network with you on Facebook. You will be amazed at how quickly your group of  friends will grow.  Updating your status often The adage use it or lose it applies on Facebook; you have to remain engaged. On your  page, you will see a link to update your status. Do this often! Your Facebook friends  see this and it will keep you and your business fresh in their minds. Updating your  status often, keeps your online exposure high. Your status updates don't always have  to be about business, they can be casual. The frequency of your status updates is  what is most important to your marketing strategy.  Posting wall comments You have a wall on your personal Facebook page where either you or your friends  can post comments. Enter your own comments or messages on your wall to keep  your friends updated on the activities of your business. Often, a musician will post  information on an upcoming concert or a retailer will post information about a  seasonal sale  don't forget the power of coupons and sale announcements in any  social media channel . You can also write comments on your friends' walls. Do not  write comments just to promote yourself constantly.  Adding an RSS feed to your page or profile If you write a blog, add an RSS feed to your page or profile. You can do this easily  with the NetworkedBlogs Facebook app. This way, your Facebook friends can see  your blog updates. You can also add links to your friends. Do you have a friend with  a business that complements yours? Add an RSS feed to your friend's blog. If you  are a network marketer, you could help promote another network marketer through  your blog. If you promote others as well as yourself, people see you as a valuable  contact and leader who has good information to share and your circle of friends and  contacts will grow steadily.  [ 193 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using Facebook Ads Facebook Ads are pay per click ads that operate similarly to Google AdWords. To  get started with Facebook Ads, browse to your business page and follow the link  Create Ads from the drop-down menu in the upper right of the Facebook menu  bar. The advantage of Facebook Ads is that you can get a higher degree of targeting,  based on what other people have written in their profiles. Not only can you target  the ads geographically, but they will also be targeted based on the information about  people's personal interests and so on from their personal profiles.  Linking your external website to Facebook You should install links on your website, that invite your visitors to sign up on your  Facebook business page. You can do this in several different ways:     By manually inserting a link in a WordPress sidebar text widget    By manually inserting a link in your WordPress template files     If you don't want to write any code, you can use the Follow Me plugin which  installs a clickable follow me tab, that expands when clicked to show a  customizable list of social media sites     Most advanced WordPress templates now have Facebook linking built-in  A more ambitious, aggressive, and effective means of attracting Facebook followers  is with pop-up boxes and footer sliders. There's no perfect free plugin for this  though, and the coding can be challenging, so if you can't code it yourself, you'll  likely want to hire a programmer to implement this strategy.  By integrating your website with Facebook, you will realize many benefits. An  interactive website will allow people the option to enter or register on Facebook and  share comments on your site and your Facebook page. As your visitors interactively  engage with both your website and Facebook, your online visibility will increase  dramatically. This increased visibility will ultimately get you more traffic and   more customers.  These are just some examples of what you can do to use Facebook to enhance or start  your business.  [ 194 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There are many companies that now use Facebook to promote their products or  services. A successful online company that is using Facebook as a marketing tool,  keeps the idea of building a community at the forefront of its consciousness. If you  are using Facebook to promote your business, then start implementing some of  these key ideas. It is fairly easy to join groups and start-up pages. The next step is to  gradually work on the implementation of the above-mentioned marketing ideas and  to increase the number of fans engaging with your pages.  Facebook can be a great addition to any marketing plan. You do not have to use all  of the applications that were mentioned. Just find the ones that work best for you.  Those who have large social networks or very active community participation, will  find Facebook to be a truly effective marketing tool. Even if you do not have a large  social network, Facebook can still be used for marketing purposes, as it can give  you access to the business pages and groups, where you can slowly win friends. Just  always remember, that it takes time to build relationships online or offline.  Automating Facebook updates with  NextScripts' Social Networks Auto-Poster NextScripts is a WordPress plugin that automatically publishes your self-hosted  WordPress blog posts, to either your personal or business Facebook page  and  also can post to a range of other social media and social bookmarking sites .

Once uploaded, click on the Activate link just under the NextScripts entry in the  plugin list.  [ 195 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   To configure the plugin, select Setting from the dashboard navigation and click on  Social Networks Auto Poster. You'll need to add your social media accounts to get  started; the plugin offers a simple wizard to get you going.

It's a great and simple way to bring some semi-automation to your content  publishing and keep your Facebook business page updated, active, and interesting  to viewers. Remember though, that automation isn't always appropriate. Yes, it's a  time-saver, but you'll lack the ability to control the specific appearance of the post on  social media sites.  [ 196 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Going viral with Facebook sharing plugins To extend your WordPress' site functionality a bit further, you'll want to consider  the wide range of available options for encouraging the sharing of your content  on Facebook. Before you install a plugin to achieve this  there are many choices ,  consider that most modern WordPress templates already have this functionality  built-in. Older templates will lack this capability. If you use a modern template from  a site like ThemeForest, ElegantThemes, or Mojo-Themes, social sharing buttons  are integrated into the template. The following screenshot shows a typical layout of  social sharing buttons on a modern WordPress template:  The integration of social sharing buttons is a very powerful benefit of a full-featured  WordPress template. Sure, you have the option of adding a plugin to add this  functionality, but plugins can cause conflicts with other plugins and don't always  look great on all sites; the more reliable way to implement social sharing buttons is to  use a modern theme. Of course, this won't be a fit for all websites.  [ 197 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If your blog or business relies on photo sharing, you may consider adding the FooBox  photo plugin. This plugin adds gorgeous pop-up functionality to your photos and  equally attractive photo sharing buttons. FooBox has a free version, but the paid  version offers valuable features. The following screenshot shows FooBox leveraged to  encourage the social sharing of an infographic with easy-to-use clickable icons.  Encouraging sharing on Pinterest and  photo sharing sites Pinterest, for those who have never used it, is a social sharing bookmarking site for  the sharing of images. There are other photo sites, but Pinterest is the largest and  most important. Here's how Pinterest works: Pinterest users create boards based  around a common topic and pin images from around the web to their boards. It  follows the model of a bookmarking site. Each pinned image is also a link back to  your site. Here's a board I made for fun: https: pinterest.com tastyplacement  ducati-italian-bikes .  Pinterest has grown tremendously in popularity in recent years. For some businesses  and bloggers, it can be a goldmine of web visitors. If you sell any type of visual  product—clothing, art, interior design, cars—then Pinterest can spread your images  like wildfire.  If you want to see how many of your websites' images have been  shared on Pinterest, there is a special URL. Point to http:  pinterest.com source yoursite.com and  Pinterest will show you all instances of your websites' images, that  have been shared by other users on the site. This valuable tool lets you  know how much viral reach your site is achieving.  [ 198 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   It's hard to force promotion and virality on Pinterest, but it's very easy for promotion  to happen naturally. Images get pinned and re-pinned based on the purely  democratic action of user behavior. This behavior can be encouraged. The simple  addition of a Pinterest share button, like the one shown in the screenshot above  of our infographic, is a vital step. Make it seamless and easy for users to pin your  images, and you'll likely do quite well on Pinterest.  Encouraging Twitter posts and the Tweet  This plugin Much in the same way we encourage the sharing of images by including social  media sharing buttons, we can also encourage Twitter activity by inviting visitors   to tweet our pages and posts.  There are several tools and plugins available that can enable you to either  automatically or semi-automatically push your WordPress blog posts to your Twitter  feed. Again, most modern WordPress templates and frameworks have Twitter sharing  buttons built in. If you want a more customized and powerful solution, one of the most  full-featured and popular plugins is the Tweet This plugin. It inserts a very prominent  Tweet This link on your Posts, so that readers can quickly and easily share your  content via their Twitter feeds, which you can see in the following screenshot:  [ 199 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The power of Tweet This lies in the prominence of the sharing button. You are more  likely to earn tweets with a prominent call to action, although; see the warning just  below about overdoing it with sharing buttons.  Taking social media too far Social media can, and often is, taken too far. Examine the screenshot below, which  was taken from the ecommerce listing of a major US company:  Two social media buttons are present. The vendor expects its users to share a  link of a 24 cent screw on Facebook, seriously? Even the social media link to  share on Pinterest is hopelessly unrealistic. This is a clear example of a company  misunderstanding how social media can impact sales. Social media buttons should  only be used when they are relevant to the content on the page. Now, if the vendor  in the above example used the same buttons on a piece of content they created  instructing how to install an outdoor deck, the social media buttons would be  appropriate and effective.  [ 200 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Keep your calls to action focused on the core actions you want your users to take.  Yes, it's great to have many Facebook likes for your business page, but a Facebook  like is an indirect conversion. When you sell a product, that is the principal  conversion that you should be seeking.  Promoting your business or blog with  YouTube As you probably know, YouTube is a video-sharing site where anyone—including  you and your business—can post videos for others to view. YouTube, just behind  Facebook and Google.com, is the third most popular website worldwide in 2015, as  reported by the Alexa ranking service, http:  www.alexa.com topsites. Youtube  also serves as a search engine in its own right. It also happens to be owned by  Google, so Google has an interest in driving search traffic to YouTube and Google  does in fact include YouTube content in search results—but you have to know how  to optimize your video submissions.  The leverage you'll enjoy from promoting your business with video will depend  on your niche and the quality of the videos you produce. Video content, like any  content, must be quality content. The biggest mistake business owners make when  publishing videos online is that the videos are amateurish productions of poor  quality. A low-quality video can do more harm than good; if you are a new or small  business competing against larger, more established competitors, an inexpensive  video can simply highlight your shortcomings. The proliferation of inexpensive  video cameras is only compounding this problem.  A high-quality video requires several elements: quality shooting and editing  equipment and software, quality lighting, sound equipment, and copy writing. If  you use a human subject, you'll want a successful performance. Finally, the video  must be compiled for display on YouTube or through an embedded video player.  Quality video production, like quality website design, is a specialized skill set. The  result you achieve will depend greatly on the team you assemble to get your video or  videos produced.  Always aim for quality. You'd have probably noticed when you use YouTube that  when you finish watching a video, YouTube shows you several thumbnails of related  videos, and video thumbnails are displayed constantly in the sidebar; understandably,  YouTube want to keep you on the site. If you generate a high-quality product, your  video will be seen by more people because higher ratings, and comment activity will  cause YouTube to offer the video to viewers, when they are watching related videos.  [ 201 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using YouTube as a hosting and delivery  platform There are two ways to display a video on your WordPress site: you can upload your  videos to YouTube and embed a few lines of code where you want the video to  display, or you can host the video yourself within your WordPress installation with  a video player plugin. Embedded YouTube videos are easier to implement, but have  some disadvantages.  One big advantage to YouTube is that you can upload nearly any video file format  and YouTube automatically processes it into their widely-accepted Flash format.  Thereafter, YouTube hosts the file on their server and allows you to embed a display  code in your Pages and Posts to display to your viewers. If you've ever tried to host  your own video, there are serious challenges: you need to install video player software  on your website, and delivering video consumes large amounts of bandwidth. Hosting  your videos on YouTube solves most of these technical challenges.  However, there is a trade off. When you host your videos at YouTube and embed a  YouTube player on your website, you'll be forced to accept whatever in-play or post- play advertising YouTube serves up with the video. A user watching an embedded  video on your website will be served up popular alternative videos, when your video  has finished playing. Those videos could conceivably be videos created and posted  by your competitors; you could quite possibly be serving up your competitor's  content on your own site! Also, YouTube is one of the most widely popular sites  on the Internet. Your viewers might simply be distracted away to something they  remember seeing or hearing about on YouTube—and you've lost your visitor.  Embedded YouTube videos come with a cost: you get free bandwidth and ease of  use, but when the video is done playing, your website's visitors are presented with  alternate videos to view. This is not ideal because you want to keep your visitors  tuned in to your message.  Using video delivery alternatives to  embedded YouTube videos Serious Internet marketers generally don't embed YouTube videos on their sites— these professionals don't want alternative choices presented to their hard-earned  website visitors. All website owners should aim for conversions; when users exit to  other websites, the conversion is lost. Luckily, there are options that can help you  serve up video content without YouTube's mandatory advertising.  [ 202 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   One option is hosting your videos with Vimeo, a competitor to YouTube. Vimeo  offers a paid service  $195 per year  that lets you submit a nearly unlimited number  of videos. Vimeo provides an interface for managing your videos, and some special  features, like the ability to display a call to action when the video reaches its end.  Vimeo delivers video quickly, in high quality, and displays on all devices. Vimeo  also gives you an easy to install link for insertion of videos into your content.  You can also use one of many plugins to self-host your video, you simply install the  plugin and upload your videos to your website. This arrangement is inexpensive, but  not ideal. These plugins often do not display videos correctly in all templates, and  may not show videos properly on all devices. If you are using a modern template, you  might have the feature already built in, which may solve all of your formatting issues.  Employing YouTube as a search engine Despite the method that you choose for the delivery of your video content, you have  to throw into the mix that YouTube video pages sometimes can rank on their own,  and are available through YouTube's search field. So, a YouTube video can be a  destination page in itself, almost like having a separate website. If you have a video  produced and self-hosted, you'll certainly want to post it on YouTube, in addition to  displaying the video on your own site.  To make your video accessible to Internet users through a search engine query,  through a search on YouTube, or to display correctly in YouTube categories, you  need to submit a proper title, description, and tags for the post. To make your  YouTube submissions search-friendly, you'll want to include keywords within  the title, description, and tags sections of the edit window when you make your  submission. Try a few sample searches in YouTube and you'll see that writing a title  and description for a YouTube video is much like writing a title and description for  a piece of content on your website. After you submit a video to YouTube, you are  presented with the video settings page.  Video success story – Will it Blend? One of the truly shining examples of clever leveraging of YouTube as a marketing  platform is the series of Will it Blend? videos by Blendtec. Blendtec makes what they  tout as commercial quality blenders for home use. In their Will it Blend? series of  tongue-in-cheek YouTube videos, they blend everything from mp3 players to golf  balls and glow sticks.  [ 203 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This campaign has been phenomenally successful, and the creators have gone on to  speak at conferences about techniques related to viral success online. Simply through  the natural viral effect of users sharing the videos, dozens of the videos have more  than one million plays and several videos have play counts in the six to nine million  range. Blendtec's YouTube channel alone has over 825,560 subscribers.  What Blentec has achieved with this masterful campaign is the equivalent of a  consistent national advertising campaign—but with a budget of thousands of   dollars instead of millions of dollars.  Promoting products and services on YouTube Always make full use of any videos produced naturally in the course of your  business. Perhaps, you already have seminars or lectures you have produced.  Perhaps, you sell a DVD—an excerpt of the DVD would be a suitable subject for a  YouTube video. Despite our warnings about video quality above, when displaying  video within your own site, for a YouTube-only video, you can lower the quality bar  slightly; it's probably better to have something on YouTube even if it isn't top-quality.  In the entertainment business, you can post content from one of your performances.  If you work in the trades, many companies have had great success by posting  instructional videos; teach readers how to use a tool, or perform a repair.   Product reviews are a great way to develop inexpensive content. The online  tool retailer ToolBarn.com has had great success on YouTube by creating short,  inexpensively-produced video reviews of tools that they sell. We learned about  ToolBarn's YouTube videos when searching for reviews of a popular hand tool.  The key is to create a video that users actually want to watch. This means  producing something educational, useful, or entertaining. Generally, straight-ahead  commercials will not perform well on YouTube. In the world of social media, it's  about creating user interest naturally; there are no couch potatoes on the Internet. If  your content doesn't interest them, they'll watch someone else's video.  [ 204 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, we looked at how to harness the growing power of social media  to extend and supplement your website presence. We learned how social media is  changing the nature of search as more users turn to social networks and specific web  properties to find information. We examined the concept of getting your content to  go viral, as well as, how to create and publish content so that it catches fire within the  social community. We learned how to employ the big three social media sites for business owners,  LinkedIn, YouTube, and Facebook, and how to set up accounts and maximize their  potential. We learned about some powerful WordPress plugins that can help you  connect your WordPress site to these social networking websites, and extend the  reach of your website farther than before.  We discovered how to harness social bookmarking sites such as Digg and  StumbleUpon to stretch your website and brand's reach even further. Finally, we  examined how to make the most of video content and the YouTube platform.  Social media and social networking are a rapidly-evolving area of search marketing,  but can, with a fair degree of effort, produce a great return on investment. In the next  chapter, we'll learn about the unsavory world of forbidden search techniques and  how to avoid them.  [ 205 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Avoiding Black Hat  Techniques  The term black hat SEO, generally refers to any manner, by which visibility,  rankings, or traffic is improved through illicit or forbidden techniques, tools, or  methods. There are a wide variety of techniques that fall under black hat: Spamming  forums, spamming blog comment areas, automated link exchange schemes, browser  hijacking, cloaking, link farms, keyword stuffing, article spinning, paid links, and  many more. The goal of this chapter is to help you sort the good from the bad, and  avoid the worst techniques and the websites that employ them.  The search engines push back against the black hat methods; they've gotten better  and better at detecting and punishing illicit techniques. Generally, when black  hat methods are discovered, Google and other search engines will impose either a  penalty or a filter  we'll learn about the distinction between those two concepts  by  making an automatic or a manual adjustment to the search results.  There's a continuum at play in the world of black hat. Some techniques, such as  browser hijacking  where viruses that infect thousands of user's PCs manually  change the search results , and cloaking  where the true content of a web page is not  shown to the search spiders  are among the most heinous of methods. On the other  end of the scale, link exchanges are less sinister, but still frowned upon by the search  engines. The lighter techniques are often called gray hat techniques.  In this chapter, we'll take a tour through the seedy side of SEO. We'll examine a wide  range of black and gray hat techniques—and why it is imperative that you avoid  them. The greatest risk to you and your business from engaging in such forbidden  techniques is that your site will be penalized or filtered in Google's search results.  [ 207 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Typical black hat techniques There are a wide range of black hat techniques fully available to all webmasters.  Some techniques can improve rankings in the short term, but generally not to the  extent that legitimate web development would, if pursued with the same effort.  The risk of black hat techniques is that, they are routinely detected and punished.  Black hat is never the way to go for a legitimate business, and pursuing black hat  techniques can get your site  or sites  permanently banned and will also require  you to build an entirely new website with an entirely new domain name. We will  examine a few black hat techniques to help you avoid them.  Hidden text on web pages Hidden text is the text that through either coding or coloring does not appear to users  but appears to search engines. Hidden text is a commonly used technique, and would  be better described as a gray hat. It tends not to be severely punished, when detected.  One technique relies on the coloring of elements. When the color of a text element is  set to the same color as the background  either through CSS or HTML coding , the  text disappears to human readers, while still visible to search spiders. Unfortunately,  for webmasters employing this technique, it's entirely detectible by Google.  More easily detectible is the use of the CSS property display: none. In the language  of CSS, this directs browsers to not display the text that is defined by that element.  This technique is easily detectible by search engines. There is an obvious alternative  to employing hidden text: simply use your desired keywords in the text of your  content and display the text to both users and search spiders.  Spider detection, cloaking, redirection, and  doorway pages Cloaking and spider detection are related techniques. Cloaking is a black hat SEO  technique whereby the content presented to search engine spiders  via search spider  detection built in to any web server  differs from the content presented to the users.  Who would employ such a technique? Cloaking is employed principally by sellers  of products typically promoted by spam, such as pharmaceutics, adult sites, and  gambling sites. Since legitimate search traffic is difficult to obtain in these niches, the  purveyors of these products employ cloaking to gain visitors.  [ 208 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Traditional cloaking relies on spider detection. When a search spider visits a   website, the headers accompanying a page view request identify the spider by  name, such as Goolgebot  Google's spider , or Slurp  Inktomi's spider . Conversely,  an ordinary web browser  presumably with a human operator  will identify itself  as Mozilla, Internet Explorer, or Safari, as the case may be. With simple JavaScript  or with server configuration, it is quite easy to identify the requesting browser and  deliver one version of a page to the search spiders and another version of the page to  the human browsers. All you really need is to know the names of the spiders, which  are publicly known.  A variation of cloaking is a doorway page. A doorway page is a page through which  human visitors are quickly redirected  through a meta refresh or JavaScript  to a  destination page. Search spiders, however, index the doorway page, and not the  destination page. Although the technique differs in execution, the effect is the same:  human visitors see one page, and the search engines see another.  The potential harm from cloaking goes beyond search engine manipulation. More  often than not, the true destination pages in a cloaking scheme are used for the  transmission of malware, viruses, and Trojans. Because the search engines aren't  necessarily reading the true destination pages, the malicious code isn't detected. Any  type of cloaking, when reported or detected, is almost certain to result in a severe  Google penalty, such as removal of a site from the search engine indexes.  Linking to bad neighborhoods and link farms A bad neighborhood is a website or a network of websites that either earns inbound  links through illegitimate means or employs other black hat on-page techniques such  as cloaking, and redirects them. A link farm is a website that offers almost no content  but serves solely for the purpose of listing links. Link farms, in turn, offer links to  other websites to increase the rankings of these sites.  A wide range of black hat techniques can get a website labeled as a bad  neighborhood. A quick test you can employ to determine if a site is a bad  neighborhood, is by entering the domain name as a part of the specialized Google  search query, site:the-website-domain.com, to see if Google displays any pages  of that website in its index. If Google returns no results, the website is either brand  new or has been removed from Google's index—a possible indicator that it has been  labeled a bad neighborhood. Another quick test is to check the site's PageRank and  compare the figure to the number of inbound links pointing to the site. If a site has a  large number of backlinks but has a PageRank of zero, which would tend to indicate  that its PageRank has been manually adjusted downwards due to a violation of  Google's Webmaster Guidelines.  [ 209 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If both of the previous tests are either positive or inconclusive, you would still be  wise to give the site a smell test. Here are some questions to ask when determining if  a site might be deemed as a bad neighborhood:     Does the site offer meaningful content?    Did you detect any redirection while visiting the site?    Did you get any virus warnings while visiting the site?     Is the site a little more than lists of links or text polluted with high numbers  of links?     Check the website's backlink profile. Are the links solely low-value    inbound links?  If it isn't a site you would engage with when visiting, don't link to it.  Google Webmaster Guidelines Google Webmaster Guidelines are a set of written rules and prohibitions that outline  recommended and forbidden website practices. You can find these webmaster  guidelines at http:  www.google.com support webmasters bin answer. py?hl=en&answer=35769, though you'll find it easier to search for Google Webmaster  Guidelines and click on the top search result. You should read through the Google  Webmaster Guidelines and refer to them occasionally. The guidelines are divided into  design and content guidelines, technical guidelines, and quality guidelines.  Google Webmaster Guidelines in a nutshell At their core, Google Webmaster Guidelines aim for quality in the technology  underlying the websites in their index, high-quality content, and also discourage  manipulation of search results through deceptive techniques. All search engines have  webmaster guidelines, but if you follow Google's dictates, you will not run afoul of  any of the other search engines. Here, we'll discuss only the Google's rules.  Google's design and content guidelines instruct that your site should have a clear  navigational hierarchy, with text links rather than image links. The guidelines  specifically note that each page should be reachable from at least one static text link.  Because WordPress builds text-based, hierarchical navigation naturally, your site  will also meet that rule naturally. The guidelines continue by instructing that your  site should load quickly and display consistently among different browsers.  [ 210 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The warnings come in Google's quality guidelines. In this section, you'll see how  Google warns against a wide range of black hat techniques, such as the following:     Using hidden text or hidden links, elements that through coloring, font size,   or CSS, display properties to show to the search engines, but do not show  them to the users.     The use of cloaking or sneaky redirects. Cloaking means a script that detects   search engine spiders and displays one version of a website to the users,  while displaying an alternate version to the search engines.     The use of repetitive, automated queries to Google. Some unscrupulous   software vendors sell software and services that repeatedly query Google   to influence Google autocomplete.     The creation of multiple sites or pages that consist solely of duplicate content   that appears on other web properties.     The posting or installation of scripts that behave maliciously towards users,   such as with viruses, Trojans, browser interceptors, or other badware.     Participation in link schemes. Google is quite public that it values inbound  links as a measure of site quality, so it is ever vigilant to detect and punish  illegitimate link programs.     Linking to bad neighborhoods. A bad neighborhood means a website that   uses illegitimate, forbidden techniques to earn inbound links or traffic.    Stuffing keywords onto pages in order to fool search spiders. Keyword   stuffing is the oldest trick in the book. It's not only forbidden, but also highly  ineffective at influencing search results and highly annoying to visitors.  When Google detects violations of its  guidelines Google, which is nearly an entirely automated system, is surprisingly capable   of detecting violations of its guidelines. Google encourages user-reporting   of spam websites, cloaked pages, and hidden text  through their page here:   https:  www.google.com webmasters tools spamreport . They maintain an  active anti-spam department that is fully engaged in an ongoing improvement in  both manual punishments for offending sites and algorithmic improvements for  detecting violations.  [ 211 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When paid link abuses are detected, Google historically always punished the linking  site, not necessarily the site receiving the link—even though the receiving site was  the one earning a ranking benefit. This position changed over the period of 2011 to  2013, and Google now issues penalties to sites receiving links when it detects that  some of the links are unnatural. We'll discuss how to handle this circumstance below. When an on-page black hat or gray hat element is detected, the penalty may be  imposed upon the offending site. The penalties range from a ranking adjustment to  an outright ban from search engine results. Generally, the penalty matches the crime;  the more egregious penalties flow from more egregious violations.  We need to draw a distinction, however, between a Google ban, penalty, and  algorithmic filtering. Algorithmic filtering is simply an adjustment to the rankings  or indexing of a site. If you publish content that is a word-for-word duplicate of  the other content on the Web, and Google doesn't rank or index that page, that's  not a penalty, it's simply the search engine algorithm operating properly. If all of  your pages are removed from Google's search index, that is most likely a ban. If  the highest ranking you can achieve is position 40 for any search phrase, that could  potentially be a penalty called a -40 penalty. All search engines can impose discipline  on websites, but Google is the most strict and imposes far more penalties than the  other search engines, so we will largely discuss Google here. Filtering is not a penalty, it is an adjustment that can be remedied by undoing  the condition that led to it. Filtering can occur for a variety of reasons but is  often imposed following over optimization. For example, if your backlink profile  comprises links of which 80 percent use the same anchor text, you might trigger a  filter. The effect of a penalty or a filter is the same: decreased rankings and traffic.  In the following section, we'll look at a wide variety of known Google filters and  penalties, and learn how to address them.  Diagnosing a Google ranking ban,  penalty, or filter If you undertake black or gray hat techniques, you run a fair chance of having  your site penalized in the search results. But even if you are not engaged in  these techniques yourself, your site may be punished for associating with black  hat purveyors. Hosting on a shared server or sharing the domain registration  information with bad neighborhoods can lead to ranking problems, if not  punishment. Certainly, linking to a bad neighborhood can lead to discipline. If you  purchase a domain, you'll nearly always inherit any penalties or bans imposed on  the prior version of the website.  [ 212 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There is a wide range of penalties and ranking filters that search engines impose,  and a still-wider range of effects that those penalties produce. In diagnosing and  correcting ranking problems, more than half the battle is about figuring out which  penalty, if any, is imposed and for what violations. Ranking problems are easy to fix,  but are arduous to diagnose with precision. Sudden drops in rankings might lead  you to suspect that you've received a penalty, but it might not be a penalty at all.  In the following section, we'll look at some specific penalties, filters, conditions and  false conditions, and how to diagnose ranking problems.  Understanding a Google ban The worst punishment that Google serves upon webmasters is a total ban. This  means the removal of all pages on a given domain from Google's index. A ban is  not always a punishment: Google may temporarily or permanently remove sites from its  index and search results if it believes it is obligated to do so by law. Google warns that  punishment bans can be meted out for certain actions, such as cloaking, writing text in  such a way that it can be seen by search engines but not by users, or setting up pages links  with the sole purpose of fooling search engines, may result in removal from our index. Note  the seriousness of those offenses.  One of the most newsworthy instances of a total ban was when Google, in 2006,  issued a total ban to the German website of carmaker BMW  http:  www.bmw.de .  Their offense was cloaked doorway pages stuffed with keywords that were shown  only to search engines, and not to human visitors. The incident became international  news, ignited at least partially by the SEO blogging community. BMW immediately  removed the offending pages and within a few weeks, Google rescinded the ban.  Diagnosing a total or partial ban To diagnose a total or partial ban penalty, run the following tests and exercises:     Check Google's index. In the Google search field, enter the following   specialized search query: site:yourdomain.com. Google then returns a  list of all of your site's pages that appear in Google's index. If your site  was formerly indexed and now the pages are removed, there is at least a  possibility that your site has been banned from Google.  [ 213 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Check if Google has blacklisted your site as hacked or unsafe for browsing    type http:  www.google.com safebrowsing diagnostic?site=mysite. com with your domain at the end . You may also be alerted to hacking by  messages in your Webmaster Tools account, as shown in this screenshot:     Check for nofollow noindex settings on your pages. It might seem obvious,  but check to make sure you haven't accidentally set your WordPress site to  noindex. To check, go to your WordPress Dashboard and click on Settings,  then Reading. If the setting Discourage search engines from indexing this  site is set, then your site will promptly fall out of Google's index. A stray  entry in a robots.txt file or in your WordPress template file can instruct  search engines not to index your entire site.  [ 214 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Check Google Webmaster Tools. Sometimes, but not always, Google will  notify you through your Webmaster Tools account that your site has been  penalized. But you won't always receive this message, so you can still be  penalized even if you don't receive it. See the following screenshot for an  example message:  PageRank adjustment PageRank penalty An alternative penalty short of an outright ban is a PageRank adjustment. The  adjustment can be partial  a drop from a PR4 to a PR2  or it can be full  a drop to  PR0 . With a PageRank adjustment, Google simply adjusts or removes the PageRank  value for a site. Google often imposes this punishment upon low-value general  directories that sell links. Part of the difficulty with diagnosing and repairing a  PageRank penalty is that the PageRank that Google shows to its users is historical;  sometimes six months pass between PageRank updates.  [ 215 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Diagnosing a PageRank penalty To diagnose a Google PageRank penalty, run the following tests and exercises:     Check your inbound links. Whenever your PageRank drops, the most likely   reason is that you've lost valuable links. Check your link profile on Open  Site Explorer. Have you lost any premium, high-PR links you had formerly?  Use the reliability of the PageRank algorithm to help diagnose: if you have  a PR4 link pointing into one of your pages, and that PR4 link has only  one outbound link, that one link alone will be strong enough to make the  destination page a PR1 or a PR2. If despite such a link, your page remains a  PR0, that raises the likelihood of a PageRank penalty.     Check all pages. Be sure to check every page on your site, you might just  have your PageRank shifting around within your site. It is true, however,  that generally your home page will have the highest PageRank value of  any page of your site. So, if you've got a PR0 on all pages including the  homepage, a PageRank penalty is suspected.     Check canonicalization. Recall the www and non-www distinction, and that  search engines see these as separate domains in some cases. WordPress  handles this automatically, but some online tools don't check this for you so  you have to be sure you're checking both, the www and non-www versions of  your domain.     Compare PageRank. Compare Google's reported PageRank score for your   pages with SEOmoz's Page Authority. Typically, these two scores will  correlate loosely  within about 10 percent . If the Google score is much lower  than the SEOmoz Page Authority score  remember that PageRank is from  0 to 10 and Page Authority is 0 to 100 , it's likely that Google is trimming  some PageRank. You can see the SEOmoz Page Authority score by visiting  http:  opensiteexplorer.org .     Check the internal links. In Google Webmaster Tools, Google reveals its   profile of internal links on your site. If your site has 100 indexed pages, but  the Google Webmaster Tools references only a handful of links, it means that  Google is not properly processing your internal links. We need to be careful  here, because a range of conditions can cause this. It can potentially arise  from a PageRank penalty, but also from poor internal navigation structure.  [ 216 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The -950 ranking penalty Google occasionally employs a -950 ranking penalty to individual pages  but not  to the entire site  for particular search queries. The -950 penalty means that for a  particular search, your page would have 950 positions added above it. So, a term  for which you ranked on page one of Google's search results at position three, you'd  now rank on page ninety-five of the search results at position 953. Sound harsh? It is,  and Google has made faint references to it as a penalty for over-optimization. Some  SEO professionals contend that they have seen the penalty imposed for shady link  building practices.  How to diagnose a -950 ranking penalty Diagnosing a -950 ranking penalty is easy: try search terms for which you formerly  ranked  hopefully you noted their exact former position  and follow the search  results out to page 95 or 96. Remember that you can always set Google to display   100 results instead of 10 by using the advanced search option at Google.com,   which is convenient for checking a ranking position in the 100s and above.  The -30 -40 ranking penalty Google often serves up another variety of penalty: it's the -30 or -40 position penalty.  This is an often-imposed penalty, and is applied by Google to the entire site, not just  particular pages and not just for particular search queries. This penalty is common  enough to trip up legitimate webmasters for very minor oversights or offenses.  Most signs point to the -30 penalty being applied algorithmically and is forgivable,  so changing the condition that led to the penalty automatically reverses the penalty.  This penalty has historically been imposed upon sites for serving up poor quality  content. For example, the penalty has been imposed upon sites that display thin  content. Thin content is the content that is partially generic, as with an affiliate site  repeating common descriptions of products it sells. Low-value directories have also  been served this penalty.  Diagnosing a -30 -40 penalty If you suspect that your site has been hit with a -30 -40 penalty, there is one surefire  test to determine if you tripped the penalty. Perform a Google search for your domain  name without the www, and without the .com, or .net, as a part of the domain. This  search, in normal circumstances, should return your site at or near the first position   depending a bit on the competition of that term . If this test yields your site showing  up in a position dropped to the 40s or 50s, it almost certainly is a -30 -40 penalty.  [ 217 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   False positives that aren't penalties Don't assume you've been penalized by Google just because your rankings drop  or because your rankings remain poor for a new site. Ranking positions can jump  around naturally, especially just before algorithm updates, when Google updates  its search engine rules. You may also have lost one or more valuable inbound  links, which can lead to a drop in rankings. You may also be alternating between  Google's personalized search modes. Personalized search is a Google feature that  returns results based on your personal browsing habits. So, if you've visited your  own website in the past few days, Google will return your website near the top  of the results, figuring that it's one of your personal favorites. Personal search is a  convenience tool, but it doesn't return true rankings. To see actual ranking results  you need to make sure that personalized search is off. To do this, clear your browser  history and open an incognito  private browsing  window and then test results.  Google penalties are almost never imposed for no reason at all. Yes, Google imposes  penalties on light offenders while more egregious violations go unpunished.  While that might not seem fair, it doesn't change the fact that if you have perfectly  complied with Google Webmaster Guidelines, you are extremely unlikely to be  penalized. If you've been penalized, there's a reason.  Clearing a Google penalty Google penalties can literally mean the death of your business. In a business climate  where such high percentages of consumers use Google for search  Google's share  of total searches hovers around 65 percent , a Google penalty can reduce your  website traffic to a trickle. There are three paths to clearing a Google penalty. First,  automated penalties and filters correct themselves when the error is corrected.  Diagnose the problem, fix it, and you are back in business. Sometimes webmasters  miss this point. They assume they have been penalized and request reconsideration  from Google and wait for a response, only to realize later that the answer to their  penalty was simply to correct the error that led to it.  Whenever you suspect a penalty, you must review Google's guidelines thoroughly.  To correct an automated or manual penalty, you must make your site 100 percent  compliant with Google Webmaster Guidelines.  The second path to correction is for more serious penalties: serious penalties will  require you to fix the violation and request reconsideration of your site from Google;  such a request can take more than a year to be heard. We'll explain how to submit a  reconsideration request in the following section. The final path to clearing a penalty  is to abandon the tainted domain, and begin with a new site.  [ 218 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Until your Google penalty is lifted, you have a few alternatives. Bing's share of the  search market is growing, especially following their partnership with Yahoo!, so  Bing can deliver meaningful traffic, although much less than what Google would  deliver. There are always paid click programs such as Google's AdWords and Bing's  AdCenter. Also, you may take advantage of pay per click campaigns in specific web  properties, such as LinkedIn and Facebook. But without doubt, a Google penalty is a  harsh sanction that will cost you the traffic and business.  Abandoning your existing domain and  starting over While it sounds drastic, you may be better off, in some cases, to abandon your  domain when struck with a Google penalty. Requesting reconsideration from  Google is where the trouble lies: it can take over a year to clear a penalty attached  to a domain and delays of up to three years are not uncommon. Then there is the  possibility that the penalty will languish indefinitely. Note that Google penalties that  attach to a site solely because it is infected with malware or other viruses do not fall  into this category. Such penalties are lifted within hours.  Here's how to evaluate the choice between abandoning a domain and sticking with  the domain, and requesting reconsideration. First, bear in mind that Google penalties  follow the domain, they do not follow the specific content. So, if you secure a new  domain and rebuild your site, page by page, your new site will not inherit the  Google penalty. WordPress has a convenient export import feature  available under  Tools in your WordPress dashboard , so rebuilding a site on a new domain takes  little time.  What you need to consider is how valuable is the old domain? Does it have a  difficult-to-obtain DMOZ listing? Is the domain a valuable domain with powerful  branding awareness with the public? Does it have thousands of links, which would  take months or years to rebuild? Or, can the link references be easily changed to  point to your new site? Is your penalized domain a newer domain? A newer domain  is less valuable than a domain with years of history and authority with the search  engines. You should also consider that you will need to update any local listings that  appear in Google Maps and Yelp, to point them to the new domain.  In some cases then, the work to create a new domain is less than the delay and  trouble you'll endure by going through the reconsideration process.  [ 219 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Cleaning your site and requesting  reconsideration following a Google penalty If your website has, with certainty, been penalized, and abandoning your old  domain isn't feasible, you'll need to begin the work to make your site, and all its  inbound links compliant with Google's webmaster guidelines. You can also request  reconsideration directly from Google, but only if you've received a manual penalty  notice in your Google Webmaster Tools dashboard. If you did not receive a manual  penalty, all you can do is clean your site and wait. Here are the steps to move toward  the reconsideration of a Google penalty.  Step 1 – Sign up and verify with Google Webmaster  Tools If you haven't already, you must create a Google Webmaster Tools account to  request reconsideration or diagnose a Google penalty effectively. If you haven't done  so already, visit http:  www.google.com webmasters to sign up for a free account.  Then, verify your site by either uploading an HTML file, adding a tag to the header  of your site, linking to a Google Analytics account, or by adding a DNS entry to your  domain configuration. The reconsideration request process is handled entirely within  the Google Webmaster Tools area. Naturally, you'll want to look in the Messages  area with Google Webmaster Tools to see if you've received a penalty notice.  Step 2 – Clean your site Before requesting a reconsideration, you must correct whatever violation or  condition led to the penalty. The key to this step is thoroughness, and you'll need  to meet a higher standard than simply meeting the bare minimum rules set forth in  Google's guidelines. Your site will be reviewed manually by a Google representative,  so you need to make sure your house is in order. That means all your content needs  to be original, no thin content affiliate pages or duplicate content.  Your site should be validated to the current HTML standards  use W3C's free  HTML validator tool at http:  validator.w3.org  . Any scripts that run on your  site will be scrutinized extremely thoroughly. Even if such scripts are harmless, if  Google can't determine that, they'll let your penalty stand. You should thoroughly  check your site for malware and malicious code. Google provides a free tool for  this, the Safe Browsing Diagnostic Tool. To use this tool, enter your website URL  manually into the following string http:  www.google.com safebrowsing  diagnostic?site=http:  yoursite.com.  [ 220 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Safe Browsing Diagnostic Tool will return a report on any malware or malicious  code hidden in your site. If you want a second opinion, you can also run your site  through AVG's free web page scanner http:  www.avg.com.au resources web- page-scanner .  Your chance for a review might take four weeks or way longer, so make sure your  site is clean when Google comes to visit.  Step 3 – Requesting reconsideration Once you have verified your site in Google Webmaster Tools and cleaned your site  of any problems, you are ready to request a reconsideration from Google. Log in to  your Google Webmaster Tools account and navigate to Manual Actions. Here is a  sample of a manual action message from Google:  [ 221 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The REQUEST A REVIEW button initiates the review process. You'll be asked to  acknowledge that my site does not violate Google's Webmaster Guidelines, and present  a narrative of the actions you took to address the violations set forth in Google's  manual action. There may be minor variations in the text of the acknowledgement,  but it will be in a very similar format. An example follows:  Step 4 – Drafting the reconsideration message The narrative you submit will be determinative. If you don't submit a complete  description of the actions you've taken, you will receive a message in a few weeks  saying that the penalty will remain in place with an invitation to request a review again.  Here's a sample of a reconsideration message that successfully removed a Google  manual penalty based on a spammy link profile; we began with a summary, just to  guide the reviewer:  Summary of Compliance Efforts -We have removed 37 links, which we feel were not compliant with Google's  webmaster -guidelines. We have contacted 14 webmasters without success.  [ 222 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We then thought it would be a good idea to reaffirm our commitment to Google's  quality guidelines.  Current Compliance and Future Commitment to Quality Guidelines We have read, and fully understand the Google Webmaster Guidelines. We see  now that some of our links clearly violated Google's Webmaster Guidelines. We  have committed substantial time and effort to cleaning out bad links. We accept  full responsibility, and we are fully committed and promise to observe Google's  guidelines in the future. Next, we presented our link removal efforts in detail, entering each link line-by-line.  We've truncated our long list of removed links in this example:  Compliance Efforts in Detail Successful Link Removal We have successfully removed or nofollowed the following links: -http:  21stguru.com -http:  www.alastdirectory.com detail link-1954.html -http:  www.aoldir.com link-krasner-hughes-and-long-188586.html Of course, we didn't successfully remove all the bad links, so we pointed out  that although we weren't successful, we did put effort into at least trying. So, we  continued.  Unsuccessful Link Removal, and Our Efforts We were unsuccessful in removing the following links, and made repeated  contacts. We have included here the dates upon which we contacted these  webmasters. -http:  www.add-top-links.com listing Society Law 10067 --9 22 13 --10 8 13 --10 22 13  [ 223 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Step 5 – Wait After submitting the reconsideration request, you simply need to visit Webmaster  Tools every few days to see if your reconsideration request was granted. In the  example just above, we received a message in Webmaster Tools about two weeks  later that our reconsideration request was granted and that the manual spam action  had been revoked. The time for processing consideration requests varies greatly,  longer times tend to be bad news:  If your request gets rejected the first few times, just keep trying. You'll need to  review your site again for violations and resubmit your reconsideration request.  Trying to e-mail Google or posting in the Google Webmaster forums isn't likely  to yield any results, and certainly won't yield any specific information in your  case. You might also consider hiring a professional with experience in handling  reconsideration requests.  [ 224 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Avoiding black hat techniques and  purveyors who promote them Books like this one are of little use to black hat webmasters, who rely on shortcuts to  web rankings and traffic, so we suspect our audience is predisposed to our warning  about black hat techniques. You are more likely to be lured into a black hat scheme  than concoct one yourself. If you honor the Google Webmaster Guidelines and  produce valuable original content, you are extremely unlikely to be penalized.  But black hat providers prowl the Internet for business constantly. You may already  have received e-mails about link exchanges and automated content services. Nearly  100 percent of all mass marketed traffic, link, and content services are black hat  services, and should be avoided. As you promote your site and become more visible  online, the number of inbound inquiries you receive will increase.  The standard black hat scam – Link exchange This is a standard pitch you might receive through an e-mail. An innocent-sounding  webmaster proposes a link between your site and theirs. Naturally, they'll open  with a generalized compliment about your site. Here's an actual e-mail, completely  representative of this type of come-on:  Hi,  My name is Lauren Robinson, Web Marketing Consultant. I've greatly  enjoyed looking through your site and I was wondering if you'd be  interested in exchanging links with my website, which has a related  subject. I can offer you a home page link back from my related  websites all in Google cache and backlinks which are:  transcendtechnology.biz   PR4  You should never pursue such a link exchange. No matter how innocent-sounding  and personal, these e-mails are sent to hundreds of thousands of webmasters, if not  millions. The sites promoted by such e-mails are nearly always bad neighborhoods  or link farms. The risk of penalization for linking to such sites is high.  [ 225 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The standard black hat scam – Website  submission service Website submission services often promote their services through e-mails or on online  forums. As the pitch goes, they will submit your site to the major search engines for  a fee. They offer specialized software as well as automated services. These services  haven't been necessary for at least 10 years, as now the major search engines find  the sites by crawling the Web, not through manual submissions. These purveyors  still exist despite the fact that the service is completely unnecessary. At worst, these  services will spam the search engine submission forms with your domain name. You  should never subscribe to a search engine submission service. There is no value to the  service, and it will be worse than doing nothing at all.  The standard black hat scam – Offshore link  building This is a common e-mail-based pitch. Most of these e-mails originate in massive  link-building shops based in India, or that part of the world. Link building is a major  industry in India and the prime source of revenue are the American-based, and  European-based businesses. Nearly all of the offshore purveyors of link building  services offer very low-quality, assembly-line link building services that are more  likely to trigger the ire of search engines than build up your website's rankings   or popularity.  The standard pitch usually sounds very similar to the following, from an e-mail  received at our consultancy, with minor variations, nearly 500 times in the past   two years:  Dear Sir \ Madam,  We are a Smart and fast growing Web Development Services company from  Delhi India .  We provide complete natural quality Link Building services in a fully  professional manner and at a very competitive cost.  We get one way high pr relative links from commenting on dofollow  blogs and forums. However, all these benefits leads to one goal:  "Increase in Sales".  [ 226 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The standard black hat scam – Autoblogging While less common, sellers of autoblogging software and services do market services  online through e-mails, websites, and pay per click ads. Here's an actual e-mail that  is fairly typical of the pitch for autoblogging services:  Generate Automatic Income While You Sleep—Auto Blog  S a m u r a i  Software 'automatically' creates content and updates your blog every  day - once your blog is set up, you're done!  Start Earning Monthly Residual Income On Autopilot—The software seamlessly  integrates with and generates profits from most popular affiliate networks such as  Google AdSense, Amazon Associates, eBay Partner Network, and ClickBank.  Autoblogged content is, by definition, duplicate content, and we've learned that it is  strongly discouraged by Google Webmaster Guidelines.  Beyond the specific services outlined here, there are others. If you follow Google  Webmaster Guidelines and follow your instincts, you should have no trouble  steering clear of Google penalties.  Summary In this chapter, we learned about a range of black hat techniques and why the  obvious course is to avoid them religiously. You must always remain vigilant in  honoring Google Webmaster Guidelines. Stay right with Google, and you'll be  rewarded with high rankings and steer clear of damaging ranking penalties.  In this chapter, we examined the full spectrum of forbidden black hat and gray  hat techniques, such as hidden text, cloaking, sneaky redirects, doorway pages,  and more. We dug into Google Webmaster Guidelines and learned how and when  Google will act on a violation. We discovered the difference between penalties,  filters, and bans, and how to distinguish them. We learned how to diagnose and  repair specific Google penalties.  Finally, we learned how to avoid the black hat techniques by steering clear of  purveyors of these forbidden techniques. By following the guidelines set forth in this  chapter, you will keep your rankings and traffic shielded from penalty. In the next  chapter, we'll learn about common SEO mistakes and how to avoid them.  [ 227 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Avoiding SEO Mistakes  We have come to learn that search optimization is a complex task, riddled with both  opportunities and pitfalls. In this chapter, we'll examine some of the most common  search ranking mistakes webmasters make while building their sites, and how you  can avoid these errors.  Every technique that we admonish in this chapter is undertaken commonly, but  always with innocent intent. Unlike the active, forbidden techniques we warned of  in the last chapter on black hat techniques, here we cover methods that are applied  without malice. Nevertheless, however, there are certain techniques and methods  that can undercut your ranking power that you will want to avoid. For example,  Adobe Flash animation graphics on websites seem innocent and effective: Flash  graphics are popular, widely used, and attractive. Unfortunately, search engines  don't read Flash effectively and reliably. And so, Flash-based websites don't perform  well in search engines. Ideally, webmasters should incorporate Flash elements in a  way that does not include any navigation links or any targeted, high-value content.  Sadly, it is typically professional web designers that serve as proponents of  placement-robbing design methods like Flash graphics and image-based navigation  menus. With web technology, just because it can be done, doesn't mean it should   be done.  Thankfully, WordPress won't let you make the most serious SEO errors, assuming,  of course, that your WordPress template is well drafted. WordPress builds sound,  hierarchical, text-based navigation that keeps most webmasters from making the  gravest of errors. There are, however, mistakes that WordPress will not prevent you  from making, and we'll discuss those here.  [ 229 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We will examine errors in keyword research that can lead to ranking troubles well  into the future. We will learn to avoid common mistakes with poor internal anchor  text. Next, we'll turn to Flash, JavaScript, image links, and other non-readable  content. We will look at the complex challenges surrounding site architecture and  look into some common mistakes that webmasters make. Then, we will turn our  attention to over-optimization in both link building and on-page factors. We'll learn  about sandboxing and jumping the gun—special challenges that webmasters face  with brand new sites.  We will continue with a warning about using free hosted domains. Next, we'll look  at some often-ignored tools: local directory listings and free verification tools. We'll  explore the risky  but sometimes necessary  practices of paying for clicks, when you  already enjoy organic rankings. We'll then look into the common errors of leaving  stray pages in search engine indexes. We'll end with a warning to remain vigilant in  the production of new content.  Pursuing the wrong keywords Keyword research lies at the foundation of all search marketing efforts. As  webmasters, we must always be mindful of what users are searching for, in what  relative volumes, and whether those keywords are relevant. WordPress will not  research keywords for you. You need to perform thorough and sound keyword  research to make sure you can grab the relevant traffic that ties web searchers with  your content. The error of pursuing the wrong keywords can infect the earliest  stages of your web marketing plan, if you choose a poor domain name, based upon a  misconception about what customers are searching for.  Perhaps the most common keyword-related mistakes come with webmasters  and business owners that make instinctual guesses at keyword volumes. SEO  professionals know that the truth is in the keyword data, not in the instinctual guess  made by a business owner. The high-volume and high-relevance terms are where  you'll find hidden profits, so that's where your efforts need to be focused. Search  volume data is never what you'd expect; the data always returns surprises, both  pleasant and unpleasant. Also, consider that some search traffic is seasonal, so you  need to constantly monitor keyword volumes for trends and adjust your strategy   as necessary.  Bear in mind that, the total volume of search traffic is not the only determinant of a  keyword's value. The search query must be relevant. A search term like AC service  is relevant both to home air conditioning service companies as well as automobile  repair service companies. On the other hand, HVAC service is a nearly 100 percent  relevant keyword to a business that does home AC service. You have to begin with  search volume data and analyze it yourself for relevancy.  [ 230 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Google has, for several years now, been correcting spelling errors in searches, yet  desperate webmasters continue to include common misspellings on pages in the  hopes of capturing errant searches. Your keyword research must be done thoroughly  and at the inception of your marketing plan, not in the middle. You can make use of  the tools mentioned in the previous chapters, like Google Keyword Planner, Google  Trends, and so on, for keyword research.  Poor internal anchor text As we have learned, the anchor text that forms a part of a link is an important  ranking element for the destination page. The anchor text serves as a signpost to the  search engines as to the content and subject of the destination. This principle applies  with respect to both external links and internal links.  Links with anchor text such as Click here, Go home, and Read More are missed  opportunities. The search engines index this anchor text and attempt to divine the  content of the destination page.  You can see this principle at work, by performing a Google search for the phrase  Click here. The number three result is the download page for Adobe's Acrobat  Reader. The reason? Over 935 million web pages have linked to the Acrobat Reader  download page and some have used the non-descriptive anchor text Click here.  Google's algorithm works properly here, but can only return the result based on  what it reads.  In your web marketing efforts, avoid this result by simply creating anchor text that  signals the subject of the destination page. This task might simply be a matter of  selecting different words as anchor text that is already present in your text. See the  following screenshot that illustrates two different approaches to the anchor text  using the same sentence. The anchor text employed in the first example sends no  keyword signal. In the second example, the anchor text leverages keywords:  [ 231 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The principle also extends to your navigation menus. Perhaps, the most commonly  used example of poor anchor text is the use of the anchor text Home in site-wide  navigation, to point users back to your home page. This error is compounded by  the fact that your home page is  or should be  your most important page reserved  for your principal keywords. Even worse, the Home link is often the first link on all  pages of a site, which implicates the controversial first link priority rule. The first link  priority rule refers to some testing results announced  but the underlying data was  not released  by the Stompernet team of SEO trainers, that discovered that the first  link read by search engines on a page is given more weight than subsequent links  on a page. The marketers at SEO.com later tested the theory and released a small  but definitive study here: https:  www.seo.com blog testing-link-priority- rule . In theory, the principle demands that extra attention be paid to that first link,  which is often a top bar, site-wide navigational link back to a website's home page.  Keep in mind that, the principle of first link priority is widely disputed.  However, whether the first link priority applies or not, you should never employ  Home as the anchor text anywhere on your site. True, users are accustomed to seeing  a Home link or button in order to navigate within a site. The effect on ranking,  however, is too substantial to ignore. If you must use the word Home for navigation,  remember that you can add Home in parenthesis along with your keyword-aware  anchor text. So, your Home link might read WordPress SEO Company [Home],  instead of Home by itself.  This is an error that WordPress will thoughtlessly make for you, if you choose Home  as the title of your home page. The best use of site-wide links to your homepage is  with anchor text that includes your primary keyword or keywords.  Flash, JavaScript, image links, and other  non-readable content Search engines do not read the text in images and do not reliably read JavaScript  navigation and Flash files. Also, the iPad doesn't support flash. Presenting non- readable content to search spiders is a fundamental error that must always be  avoided, even at the expense of a website's appearance. Google Webmaster  Guidelines dictate: Make a site with a clear hierarchy and text links. Every page should be reachable from   at least one static text link. Try to use text instead of images, to display important names,  content, or links. The Google crawler doesn't recognize text contained in images. If you must  use images for textual content, consider using the ALT attribute to include a few words of  descriptive text.  [ 232 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Despite the clear logic and strong dictates of this rule, this is an area where  uninformed web designers can often undermine their clients' rankings. Flash-based  websites are sometimes the worst offenders, because they often incorporate almost  no text that can be read by search engines. Designers that specialize in Flash-based  websites dazzle clients with animation while eventually destroying their rankings.  Webmasters of WordPress-based sites may typically worry less about Flash  navigation. The default WordPress template and all free templates on WordPress.org  do not employ Flash navigation. That said, there are commercial WordPress templates  available, that incorporate Flash navigation, and there are certainly web developers  willing to incorporate Flash elements into a WordPress installation, for those who  request it.  Next, we turn to the use of images to display content within site navigation.  As we have learned, Google does not read the text in images. We should note,  however, that Google has made some hints that it ultimately will apply optical  character recognition  OCR  technology, in order to read the text in images, but  that innovation is far off. For the foreseeable future, you may fully expect that any  text that appears in images will be totally ignored by search engines. While Google  Webmaster Guidelines instruct that, if you must use images for textual content, consider  using the ALT attribute to include a few words of descriptive text; this solution isn't ideal.  Google might read the ALT attribute, but it won't give great weight to your ALT  tags, and you should never use ALT tags to include long passages of text.  The warning against the use of images to display text is further compounded when  images are used to display text, that is also the subject of site navigation. Not only  will the search engines have no text to read, but they will have no link anchor text to  read either. Recall that the anchor text of a link serves as a signpost to Google as to  the subject of the destination page. If the hyperlink anchor is an image, Google will  index a blank entry for the anchor text, and that's a missed opportunity to employ a  powerful ranking factor.  [ 233 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Poor site architecture Another example of a common SEO mistake that you should endeavor to avoid is  poor site architecture. Site architecture is the skeleton of your website: it is the design  and navigational framework that dictates the flow of both the user behavior and  search engine spider behavior on your site. Site architecture needs to be considered  at the planning stages of your website. Effective site architecture should display  a visible and comprehensible navigational structure to both the users and search  spiders, that echoes your content hierarchy. Sound site architecture will yield  thorough search engine spidering, engaged visitors, and higher PageRank flow to  your primary pages. Poor site architecture can mean that search engines can't crawl  your site effectively, and users can't find what they need to convert into customers.  Many SEO professionals will concede that website architecture is one of the most  difficult SEO skills to master. Site architecture demands that a webmaster deftly  blend and balance the skills of conversion science, usability, coding, and PageRank  sculpting. WordPress does about half the work of site architecture for you; for the  other half, you'll need to think thoroughly about your site hierarchy.  WordPress performs some important architecture tasks automatically:     Your content hierarchy is echoed semi-automatically into your navigation   menus  as long as you employ WordPress' custom menu features . All  published pages appear in your navigation without requiring further action.  Thus, no Pages or Posts can be accidentally forgotten or left out of your  navigation.     Your WordPress navigation menus are text-based by default, ensuring   thorough spidering.     Nearly all WordPress themes display your navigational hierarchy in a   visually intuitive way. For example, Pages that are children of parent pages  are visually indicated in navigation through indentation or a reduced font  size. This helps your readers understand the relationship between site  elements. Furthermore, child pages are coded by the WordPress engine in a  way that indicates to search spiders their position in your site's hierarchy.  [ 234 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   However, WordPress will rely on you for the following:     You must make sure both Pages and Posts display throughout the site. A  WordPress template that lacks a header navigation area  rare, but they do  exist  might require you to manually add sidebar widgets to display Posts  and Pages. If you can reach all of your Pages and Posts from anywhere on  your site, you have done this correctly.     WordPress themes with custom templates and multiple sidebar widget areas  can be problematic: such themes require you to be vigilant to make sure you  have adequate navigational links in all areas of your site. Beware of shifting  navigation—navigation that changes as users pass through different areas of  your site. Shifting navigation confuses both the users and search spiders.     Your site hierarchy, the relationship, and the structure of Pages, Posts, tags,   and categories to each other and to the whole, all fall solely upon you. All  WordPress can do, is faithfully present the content and categorization that  you submit to it.  Don't forget what we've learned about WordPress' propensity for duplicate content  on archive and tag pages—that content should almost always be no-indexed through  the use of a robots.txt file.  WordPress' default navigation is fairly bland—it presents a single navigational entry  for each Page or Post. To highlight particular areas of your site, or to push extra link  power to the important sections of your site, you'll want to add some links manually.  We cover this advanced technique in the following section.  Expert site architecture with manual links and  PageRank sculpting If you want to drive extra traffic and ranking power to a few of your most important,  primary keyword-based pages, you can achieve it with a few extra manual links.  In your sidebar or footer, use a WordPress text widget to craft three or four extra  navigational links to your highest-value pages. You can title the widget Popular  Pages, to draw additional user interest and traffic to the pages. In addition, you'll  send extra PageRank  and hence the extra ranking power  to these high-value pages.  The use of navigation to either send or restrict ranking power to sections or pages of  your site is called PageRank sculpting.  [ 235 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The following screenshot shows some PageRank sculpting  and heightened usability   in action. Note, the key links are placed prominently in the footer of a WordPress site  with the use of a text widget. These links highlight the website's most popular pages.  In addition, these links send extra PageRank to those key pages:  Over-optimization Over-optimization refers to the excessive use of optimization techniques, that  ultimately yields either penalization or poor rankings. We've touched on over- optimization throughout this book, and it always remains a danger if one is actively  optimizing and promoting a site. A good way to think about over-optimization is  Unnatural optimization. Put another way, the search engines want to present search  results that represent naturally-written content. They don't want to display content  that specifically manipulates rankings. For example, would it be natural that an  article on Houston apartments would have the phrase Houston apartments repeated  20 or 30 times in the article? Of course not. This is where the over-optimization  component of the search engines' algorithms come into play.  Over-optimizing of on-page factors –  Guidelines You must ensure that your on-page factors  text, headings, bold, ALT tags, and so  on  are not over optimized. If you write your pages naturally, you'll most likely  never trigger over-optimization. However, aggressive optimization in competitive  markets will typically require that the content be written with a keyword focus in  mind. It's easy to get somewhat carried away with optimization, and you'll want to  follow some established guidelines, to make sure you don't go too far. Mathematical  rules for optimization are not published  for obvious reasons , but some sound best  practices have emerged.  [ 236 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Some sound guidelines to follow to ensure that you aren't over-optimizing, are the  following:     The keyword usage on a particular page of body text should comprise about   5 percent of the total words on the page; more than 8 percent to 10 percent  of total words on the page is risky and isn't going to present a very nice user  experience anyway.     The keyword usage in heading tags should not comprise more than 35   percent to 40 percent of the total words within the heading tags.     Vary your keyword prominence. Your keywords should not be used as   the first words in 100 percent of your website elements. To do so appears  completely unnatural, and is easy for search engines to detect. A general rule:  never use the same phrase of two or more words as the first words in more  than one-third of your website elements.     All of the major elements of a website, taken as a whole  title tag, meta   description, meta keywords, body copy, image ALT tags, heading tags, body  copy, and outbound links , should never contain the exact keyword phrase,  even if diluted with other terms. Some of your website's lower-weight elements  like ALT tags and lower-lever heading tags should have no keywords present  within them.     Don't employ perfectly matching elements. You should never have   individual website elements be exact matches of other elements. For example,  you do not want to have an exact match among your title tag, h1 tag, and  h2 tag. Vary the text, so that the page does not appear machine-generated.    Don't mindlessly repeat keywords in your site navigation. If your site has  20 pages and they appear in your navigation as Used Cars Dallas, Used Cars  Houston, Used Cars Plano, and so on, that pattern is easy to detect and you  should avoid it.     The more important the element, the more likely you'll trigger over-  optimization. It's almost impossible to trigger over-optimization by tinkering  with italics, bold text, and ALT tags, while the more powerful elements like  title tags and headings can more easily trigger problems.     Over-optimization becomes more likely as the scale of your site grows. For  example, five pages with repetitive text in the site navigation anchor text is  not nearly as risky as fifty pages with repetitive text.  [ 237 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Over-optimizing inbound links – Guidelines The over-optimization inquiry does not end with your on-page factors. You must  also consider the effect of over-optimization of inbound links. This is the most  common area where webmasters misstep and trigger over-optimization troubles  with Google. The notion of natural optimization again applies here; you want your  inbound links to appear as if they were built naturally by other webmasters, that  selected your site as link-worthy, because of the quality of your content. Again,  mathematical rules on the over-optimization of inbound links are neither published,  nor helpful, but sound guidelines have emerged.  Over-optimization in link building can be distilled to a single principle: don't secure  all your links with the same anchor text. Now, because you'll garner some links  naturally without any input from you, you'll gain links that have whatever anchor  text the other webmasters select. Inbound links for which you are able to choose your  anchor text  such as directory submissions , must be varied.  A sound general rule to follow is that you never want more than 20 percent of your  inbound links  measured by either number of links or by link power  to share the  same anchor text. The 20 percent figure is a personal guideline; were you to ask 100  SEO professionals, you would get 100 different opinions. An exception to this rule  is the obvious: your company or blog name. If you have a company called Midwest  Pediatric Associates with a domain MidwestPediatrics.com, then it is safe to have a  high proportion of links with your business name as the anchor text.  Note that, the 20 percent suggestion applies to both numbers of links and power of  links. If you have 1,000 inbound links, you want no more than 200 of those inbound  links to share the same exact anchor text. However, the guideline also applies to the  power of your inbound links. So, if you have 800 poor quality links but 200 very  high-powered, high PageRank links and if all of these 200 links share the same exact  anchor text, then you are running the risk of over-optimization.  Jumping the gun and the sandbox Brand new websites can sometimes be subject to the sandbox effect. The sandbox  effect is a highly debated observation, about the way Google serves relatively poor  rankings for new websites in the first months of launch. No observer can seem to  agree on whether the sandbox effect even exists, let alone how it operates. Google  has been tight-lipped  Google almost never reveals specifics about its algorithm .  [ 238 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   What is reasonably certain is that the sandbox effect often doesn't apply to all niches.  Brand new sites can rank quite well, but typically in less competitive markets. So, if  the sandbox effect is being algorithmically imposed by Google, it is being imposed  only upon certain categories and niches. It is also possible that the sandbox effect is  triggered by some external trigger, such as garnering too many powerful links   too quickly.  Don't fight the sandbox effect. In the first months of your website's life, you need to  build the links slowly. Don't simply rush out and secure dozens of high-powered  links right away. However, a large number of high-value links can look unnatural.  The general consensus among SEO professionals is that securing high-powered links  immediately upon a website's launch, can trigger very poor rankings for a period of  up to one and a half years.  The better approach to link building in the first few months of your site's life is to  roll out links gradually, building up slowly through the first six months. Some SEO  professionals will build 15 links in the first month, 30 links in the second month, and  50 links in the third month. Now, if you achieve prominent rankings quite quickly,  you are very likely to have avoided the sandbox effect, and you can safely begin   full-scale link building. Tread gently at first, and watch your rankings. Once the  rankings come through, you are on the safer ground.  Using free hosted domains Free hosted platforms like Blogger.com and WordPress.com provide a valuable  service, but they aren't appropriate as the primary destination for a business that  works in a competitive SEO market. WordPress' free blogging service  available  through WordPress.com instead of WordPress.org  offers users a free, full-featured  blog on the WordPress platform. The free service offers hosting on a subdomain   http:  yoursite.wordpress.com , but a custom domain is available for about $99  a year. Be warned: the custom domain feature requires some sound knowledge of  domain mapping.  No free hosted domain will ever match the design flexibility and ranking power  of custom domain. You'll be limited as to the themes and plugins you'll be able to  install. Without the freedom to install plugins, you'll limit the SEO power available  to you. And, if your site resides on a subdomain of WordPress.com, you'll be poorly  regarded by search engines and customers alike. Search engines don't rank free  hosted domains very highly, and customers know they are free, so they might not  take your business seriously.  [ 239 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Forgetting verification tools Yoursite.wordpress.com offers much more than insight into how the search  spiders interact with your site. It also provides a verification function. Verifying  your site through Google Webmaster Tools, lets Google know that your site has an  active and engaged webmaster. The same goes for Google Analytics. Having Google  Analytics installed on your site sends a signal to Google, that an active webmaster is  at the helm. The same dictate applies to having an XML sitemap that resides in your  site's root directory. Your sitemap, even if not needed for indexing purposes, lends  additional credence to your website.  Ignoring local directory listings Organic search results are not the only game in town. Local directory listings are now  served up by all three major search engines as well as by dozens of independent sites  such as Yelp, HotFrog, MerchantCircle, and InsiderPages. In some local business  niches, local directory listings can deliver up to 35 percent of total web traffic.  You can broaden your overall reach by securing complete listings on any or all  directory sites. Google, Yahoo!, and Yelp are the most important, although Yahoo!  is in the process of selling off its local features. With a few dozen business directory  listings, you'll stand a better chance of blanketing the first page of Google's results  when users search for your business' name. If you are highly effective at creating  complete, keyword-rich local directory listings, your listings themselves might  rank for primary and secondary keywords. What follows are some guidelines for  supplementing your natural search results with strong, high-ranking individual  business listings.  Always assigning as many categories as  possible This is paramount. Google Places allows you up to five categories into which you  can place your business listing. With most local business directories, each business  category under which you register, will create an individual entry on an individual  category page. So, your entry might appear in five different places in a directory.  Each page is a backlink for the traffic, and for the PageRank value  assuming the  link is followed, in Google Places it is not , and your listing will quite simply be seen  more often.  [ 240 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting reviews Reviews from happy customers can help boost your rankings within the local  directory. Google Places is the greatest example. While their ranking system for local  entries is a secret, Google obviously favors entries that have received reviews. I'll bet  you've done a favor for a client at one time, right? Ask them for a review. Send them  a clear and concise e-mail with instructions and a link to write the review. Besides  the ranking power within the directories, reviews will increase the conversion power  of the local entry; readers are more likely to follow up on your ad, if they see a  positive review from a member of the community.  Also, positive reviews can offset a present or future negative review. If a negative  review does get written, a positive review can soften the blow.  Uploading pictures to your local listings The larger local business directories are quite advanced, and most of them include  the ability to upload pictures. Always upload the maximum number of pictures. A  full and complete listing is always more likely to rank higher within the directory.  And again, viewers are far more likely to act on a complete listing, rather than a  sparse one.  Completing all optional fields When creating a local business entry, you may have noticed many optional fields  such as business hours, payment types accepted, and languages spoken. These fields  are optional and most folks just skip them.  You should always fill out every optional field possible. In some directories, the extra  fields have the effect of enlarging the directory entry, while omitting it would just  display nothing. So, your listing might be 5 or 6 inches tall on a results page, while  your competitors—those who skipped the optional fields—will have a simple two or  three line entry.  Also, some directories allow  or will allow in the future  users to use the optional  fields as search criteria  that is, the ability to search for companies that accept Google  Checkout, and so on . Naturally, you'll want to come up in any such search result.  [ 241 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Making multiple entries for multiple locations If you have multiple business locations, make separate entries for each location.  However, don't create multiple entries unless each entry has a separate phone  number. Google Places often merges listings, if it encounters a common phone  number. With multiple entries, each location will show up in searches separately   many folks search by ZIP code . Each entry will represent a backlink.  Writing a compelling business description  with keywords This goes without saying, but 75 percent of the folks don't bother. A compelling  business description will convert viewers and draw them to your site. And, if your  description is focused on your primary keywords, then your local business entry will  likely to be ranked for those keywords.  Paying for clicks when you rank organically Don't cannibalize your natural rankings with expensive paid search ads. There is an  interaction between natural search entries and paid ads. Say you rank organically  in Google for the term Stop smoking ad, and you also have paid ads competing  on the same search results page. The paid clicks you purchase might be clicks you  could have had already. It's a judgment call. Are the clicks 20 cents or 10 dollars?  And, even if you do pay for some of your traffic, are you earning a positive return on  investment in the paid click channel?  Perhaps, the most egregious example of the cannibalization of organic traffic is the  purchased paid clicks for one's own business name. This practice almost certainly  directs users into paid clicks, when the organic entry is clearly visible. National  brands often employ this technique. Brands such as Dr. Pepper and Federal Express  purchase paid clicks in the Google Adwords program. This practice is almost never  necessary for smaller businesses and will nearly always result in higher search costs,  than are necessary. There are only two instances where such a practice is advisable:  when the bid prices for clicks are in pennies, or when competitors are bidding on  clicks for your business name.  [ 242 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Leaving stray pages in Google's index If you have Flash files and PDF files on your site, Google will eventually find those  pages and index them—even if you don't intend for them to be searchable pages.  Eventually, you'll have a slew of ugly, unappealing indexed entries in Google's  search results. These pages will often compete in search results for your primary  terms. You can check Google's index of your site by entering the site:yourdomain. com query in the Google search box.  You should monitor the index that Google maintains for your site, to make sure that  no low-value pages have made their way into the index. To remove the files from  Google's index, simply create an entry in your robots.txt file instructing the search  engines to ignore particular pages.  Failing to produce fresh new content Fresh content can be almost anything. It can be regular blog posts related to the  topic of your site. It can be photographs of the work you've done, or events in which  you've participated. It can be announcements of new products or services you've  added to your offerings. It can even be coupons and specials, that you offer on your  services. New content can have purely commercial intent, although you'll get more  mileage if most of your new content is meaningful to users.  When a website remains static, the search engines recognize that nothing has  changed, and the spiders will visit at less frequent intervals. The value of the site  as a whole will diminish in the eyes of the search engines. New content sends a  completely different signal. New content serves as a signpost, that your site is an  active and engaging community. The search engines will send spiders more often to  crawl your site and your rankings will rise.  Remember that, you can schedule content to publish in the future with WordPress.  When you create a new Page or Post, you simply need to click the Edit link next to  Publish immediately in the Publish box when creating new content. If you have  three articles of new content, don't post them all immediately; you can schedule  them so that they publish at one week intervals in the future. Regular posting of new  content is preferable to posting chunks of new Pages and Posts every few months.  It's tough to stick with a regular blogging routing. Writing content takes time, and  writing quality content takes even more time. The rewards are so obvious and  reliable, however, that creating new content is a mandate for success online.  [ 243 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, we covered the most obvious, common, and avoidable SEO mistakes.  With the information in this chapter, you'll easily steer clear of the most typical errors.  We examined the practice of pursing the wrong keywords and continued with the  common practices of selecting poor anchor text. We learned about a wide range of  content that search engines can't reliably read: Flash animations, JavaScript, and  image files. We looked at poor site architecture and examined what WordPress  accomplishes for you, and where you'll need to step in to assure your site  architecture is easily spidered by search engines and sensible to users. We furthered  this inquiry to explore the advanced topic of PageRank sculpting.  We explored over-optimization of both the on-page factors, as well as the inbound  links. We warned about the common practice of jumping the gun—securing inbound  links that are overwhelmingly powerful when your site is brand new. We discussed  the proper way to ease yourself into favor with the search engines.  We warned against the use of free hosted domains like Blogspot.com and   WordPress.com. We reminded you of the importance of the supplemental  verification functions provided by Google Webmaster Tools and Google Analytics.  We also learned not to ignore parallel search channels like the local directory listings.  We continued with an examination of the danger of paying for clicks, when your site  already enjoys robust organic rankings.  Finally, we learned how to identify and clear stray pages from Google's index,  and discussed the importance of producing regular fresh content. Armed with the  warnings and instructions in this chapter, you will easily avoid the most common  SEO mistakes and you won't hamper your rankings as you pursue your Internet  marketing plan. In the next chapter, we'll learn how to test your site and monitor  your progress.  [ 244 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Testing Your Site and  Monitoring Your Progress  Once you have built your website and started promoting it, you'll want to monitor  your progress to ensure that your hard work is yielding both high rankings, search  engine visibility, and web traffic. In this chapter, we'll cover a range of tools with  which you will monitor the quality of your website, learn how search spiders interact  with your site, measure your rankings in search engines for various keywords, and  analyze how your visitors behave when they are on your site. With this information,  you can gauge your progress and make adjustments to your strategy.  Obviously, you'll want to know where your web traffic is coming from, what search  terms are being used to find your website, and where you are ranking in the search  engines for each of these terms. This information will allow you to see what you still  need to work on in terms of building links to the pages on your website.  There are five main tools you will use to analyze your site and evaluate your traffic  and rankings, and in this chapter, we will cover each in turn. They are Google  Analytics, Google Search Console  formerly Webmaster Tools , HTML Validator,  Bing Webmaster, and Link Assistant's Rank Tracker. As an alternative to Bing  Webmaster, you may also want to employ Majestic SEO to check your backlinks.  We'll cover each of these tools in turn.  [ 245 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Google Analytics Google Analytics monitors and analyzes your website's traffic. With this tool, you  can see how many website visitors you have had, whether they found your site  through the search engines or clicked through from another website, how these  visitors behaved once they were on your site, and much more. You can even connect  your Google AdSense account to one or more of the domains you are monitoring in  Google Analytics to get information about which pages and keywords generate the  most income. While there are other analytics services available, none match the scope  and scale of what Google Analytics offers.  Setting up Google Analytics for your website To set up Google Analytics for your website, perform the following steps:  1.  To sign up for Google Analytics, visit http:  www.google.com   analytics .  2.  On the top-right corner of the page, you'll see a button that says, Sign In to  Google Analytics. You'll need to have a Google account before signing in. 3.  You will have to click Sign up on the next page if you haven't already, and   on the next page you'll enter your website's URL and time zone.  If you have more than one website, just start with one. You can add  the other sites later. The account name you use is not important, but  you can add all of your sites to one account, so you might want to use  something generic like your name or your business name.  4.  Select the time zone country and time zone, and then click on Continue. 5.  Enter your name and country, and click on Continue again. Then you will   need to accept the Google Analytics terms of service.  [ 246 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After you have accepted the terms, you will be given a snippet of HTML code   that you'll need to insert into the pages of your website. The snippet will look   like the following:       function i,s,o,g,r,a,m {i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]fu nction  {    i[r].q=i[r].q[] .push arguments },i[r].l=1*new Date  ;a=s. createElement o ,   m=s.getElementsByTagName o [0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode. insertBefore a,m    }  window,document,'script','  www.google-analytics.com analytics. js','ga' ;  ga 'create', 'UA-xxxxxx-x', 'auto' ;   ga 'send', 'pageview' ;   The code must be placed just before the closing head tag in each page on your  website. There are several ways to install the code. Check first to see if your  WordPress template offers a field to insert the code in the template admin area— most modern templates offer this feature. If not, you can insert the code manually  just before the closing the   tag, which you will find in the file called header. php within your WordPress template files. There is yet a third way to do this, if you  don't want to tinker with your WordPress code. You can download and install one  of the many WordPress analytics plugins. Two sound choices for an analytics plugin  would be Google Analyticator or Google Analytics by Yoast; both the plugins are  available at WordPress.org.  If you have more than one website, you can add more websites within your analytics  account. Personally, I like to keep one website per analytics account just to keep  things neat, but some like to have all their websites under one analytics account. To add a second or third website to an analytics account, navigate to Admin on the  top menu bar, and then pull down the menu under Account in the left column, and  then click Create a New Account. When you are done adding websites, click Home on the top menu bar to navigate to  the main analytics page.  [ 247 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   From here, you can select a web property. This is the screen that greets you when  you log in to Google Analytics, the Audience Overview report. It offers an effective  quick look at how your website is performing:  [ 248 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using Google Analytics Once you have installed Google Analytics on your websites, you'll need to wait a few  weeks, or perhaps longer, for Analytics to collect enough data from your websites to  be useful. Remember that with website analytics, like any type of statistical analysis,  larger sets of data reveal more accurate and useful information. It may not take that  long if you have a high-traffic site, but if you have a fairly new site that doesn't get a  lot of traffic, it will take some time, so come back in a few weeks to a month to check  to see how your sites are doing. The Audience Overview report is your default report that is displayed to you when  you first log into analytics and gives you a quick overview of each site's traffic.  You can see at a glance, whether the tracking code is receiving data, how many visits   sessions  your website has gotten in the past 30 days, the average time visitors stay  on your site  session duration , your bounce rate  the percentage of users that come  to visit your site and leave without visiting another page , and the percentage of new  sessions  users that haven't visited before  in the past 30 days.  The data displayed on the dashboard is just a small taste of what you can learn from  Google Analytics. To drill down to more detailed information, you'll navigate to  other sections of analytics using the left menu. Your main report areas in analytics  are Audience  who your visitors are , Acquisition  how your visitors found your  site , Behavior  what your visitors did on your site , and Conversions  did they make  a purchase or complete a contact form .  Within any of the main report areas are a dozens of available reports. Google  Analytics can offer you tremendous detail on almost any imaginable metric related  to your website. Most of your time, however, is best spent with a few key reports.  Understanding key analytics reports Your key analytics reports will be the Audience Overview, Acquisition Overview,  and the Behavior Overview. You access each of these reports by navigating to the  left menu area and each corresponding overview report is the first link in each list. The Audience Overview report is your default report, discussed earlier.  [ 249 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Acquisition Overview report drills down into how your visitors are finding  your site, whether it is through organic search, pay per click programs, social media,  or referrals from other websites. These different pathways by which customers  find your site are referred to as channels or mediums on other reports, but mean  essentially the same thing. The Acquisition Overview report also shows some very  basic conversion data, although the reports in the Conversions section offer much  more meaningful conversion data. The following screenshot is an Acquisition  Overview report:  [ 250 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Why is the Acquisition Overview report important? It shows us the relative strength  of our inbound channels. In the case above, organic search is delivering the highest  number of users. This tells us that we are getting most of our users from the organic  search results—our organic campaign is running strong. Referrals generated 384 visits,  which means we've got good links delivering traffic. Our 369 direct visitors don't come  from other websites, it's a fresh browser page where users type our URL directly or  follow a bookmark they've saved. That is a welcome figure because it means we've got  strong brand and name recognition, and in the conversions column on the right side  of the table we can see that our direct traffic generated a measurable conversion rate.  That's a positive sign that our brand recognition and reputation is strong. The Behavior Overview report tells us how users behave once they visit our site. Are  they bouncing immediately or viewing several pages? What content are they viewing  the most? Here's a sample Behavior Overview report:  [ 251 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Some information is repeated on the Behavior Overview report, such as Pageviews  and Bounce Rate. What is important here is the table under the graph. This table  shows you the relative popularity of your pages. This data is important because it  shows you what content is generating the most user interest. As you can see from the  table, the page titled  add-sidebar-wordpress generated over 1,000 pageviews, more  than the home page, which is indicated in analytics by a single slash    . This table shows you your most popular content—these pages are your greatest  success. And remember, you can click on any individual page and then see  individual metrics for that page.  One way to maximize your site earnings is to focus on improving the performance of  the pages that are already earning money. Chances are, you earn at least 80 percent  of your income from the top 20 percent of the pages on your site. Focus on improving  the rankings for those pages in order to get the best return for your efforts.  With any analytics report, by default the statistics shown will all be for the past  month, but you can adjust the time period by clicking on the down arrow next   to the dates in the upper right hand corner.  Setting up automated analytics reports You can also use Google Analytics to e-mail you daily, weekly, or monthly reports.  To enable this feature, simply navigate to the report that you'd like to be sent   to you. Then click the Email link just under the report title. The following   pop-up will appear:  [ 252 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Frequency field lets you determine how often the report is sent, or you can  simply send the report one time.  Google Webmasters Search Console The process of setting up an account with Google's Search Console  formerly Google  Webmasters, and formerly Google Webmaster Tools  has already been covered  earlier in this book, along with a basic overview of the different tools available.  Now, we are going to go into a bit more detail, and show you how to use Google  Webmaster Tools to obtain information that you can use to improve your website.  Understanding your website's search queries The Search Console now shows you data on what search queries users entered in  Google search to find their way to your website. This is valuable: it teaches you what  query terms are effectively delivering customers. To see the report, expand Search  Traffic on the left navigation menu and select Search Analytics. The following report  will display:  [ 253 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Examine the top queries that Search Console shows you are getting traffic for, and  add them to your list of keywords to work on, if they are not already there. You will  probably find that it is most beneficial to focus on those keywords that are currently  ranked between 4 and 10 in Google, to try to get them moved up to one of the top  three spots.  You'll also want to check for crawl errors on each of your sites while you work in  the Search Console. A crawl error is an error that Google's spider encounters when  trying to find pages on your site. A dead link, a link to a page on your site that no  longer exists, is a common and perfect example of a crawl error.  Crawl errors are detrimental to rankings. First, crawl errors send a poor quality  signal to search engines. Remember that Google wants to deliver a great experience  to users of its search engine and properties. Dead links and lost pages do not deliver  a great experience to users. To see the crawl error data, expand the Crawl link on the left navigation bar and  then click Crawl Errors. The crawl error report will show you any pages that Google  attempted to read but could not reach. Not all entries on this report are bad news. If  you remove a piece of content that Google crawled in the past, Google will attempt  for months to try to find that piece of content again. So, a removed page will generate  a crawl error. Another way crawl errors get generated is if you have a sitemap file  with page entries that no longer exist. Even inbound links from third party websites  to pages that don't exist will generate crawl errors.  Other errors you find might be the result of a typo or the other error that involves  going into a specific page on your website to fix. For example, perhaps you made a  mistake typing in the URL when linking from one page to another, resulting in a 404  error. To fix that, you need to edit the page that the URL with the error was linked  from and correct the URL.  Other errors might require editing the files for your template to fix multiple errors  simultaneously. For example, if you see that the Googlebot is getting a 404  page not  found  error every time it attempts to crawl the comments feed for a post, then the  template file probably doesn't have the right format for creating those URLs. Once you  correct the template file, all of the crawl errors related to that problem will be fixed.  There are other things you can do in Google Webmaster Tools, for example, you can  check to see how many links to your site Google is detecting.  [ 254 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Checking your website's code with a  HTML Validator HyperText Markup Language  HTML  is a coding standard with a reasonable  degree of complexity. HTML standards develop over time, and a valid HTML code  displays more websites more accurately in a wider range of browsers. Sites that have  substantial amounts of HTML coding errors can potentially be punished by search  engines. For this reason, you should periodically check your website for HTML  coding errors.  There are two principal tools that web professionals use to check the quality of their  websites' code: the W3C HTML Validator and the CSE HTML Validator.  The W3C HTML Validator  http:  validator.w3.org  is the less robust of the   two validators, but it is free. Both validators work in the same way: they examine   the code on your website and issue a report advising you of any errors.  The CSE HTML Validator  http:  htmlvalidator.com  is not a free tool, but  you can get a free trial of the software that is good for 30 days or 200 validations,  whichever comes first. This software catches errors in HTML, XHTML, CSS, PHP,  and JavaScript. It also checks your links to ensure that they are all valid. It includes  an accessibility checker, spell checker, and a SEO checker. With all of these functions,  there is a good chance that if your website has any problems, the CSE HTML  Validator will be able to find them.  After downloading and installing the demo version of CSE HTML Validator, you  will be given the option to go to a page that contains two video demos. It is a good  idea to watch these videos, or at least the HTML validation video, before trying to  use the program. They are not very long, and watching them will reduce the amount  of time it takes you to learn to use the program.  To validate a file that is on your hard drive, first open the file in the editor, then click  the down arrow next to the Validate button on the task bar. You will see several  options. Selecting Full will give you not only errors, but messages containing  suggestions as well. Errors only will only show you actual errors, and Errors and  warnings only will tell you if there are things that could be errors, but might not be.  You can experiment with the different options to see which one you like best.  After you select a validation option, a box will appear at the bottom of the screen  listing all of the errors, as well as warnings and messages depending on the option  you chose. You might be surprised at how many errors there are, especially if you  are using WordPress to create the code for your site. The code is often not as clean as  you might expect it to be. However, not all of the errors you see will be things that  you need to worry about or correct.  [ 255 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Yes, it is better to have a website with perfect coding, but one of the advantages of  using WordPress is that you don't have to know how to code to build a website. If  you do not know anything about HTML coding, you may do more harm than good  by trying to fix minor errors, such as omission of a slash at the end of a tag. Most of  these errors will not cause problems anyhow. You should look through the errors  and fix the ones you know how to fix. If you are completely mystified by what you  see here, don't worry about it too much unless you are having a problem with the  way your website loads or displays. If the errors are causing problems, you'll either  have to learn a bit about coding or hire someone who knows what they're doing to  fix your website.  If you want to be able to check the code of an entire website at once, you'll need to  buy the Pro version of CSE HTML Validator. You can then use the batch wizard to  check your website. This feature is not available in the Standard or Lite versions of the  software. To use the batch wizard, click on Tools, then Batch Wizard. A new window  will pop up, allowing you to choose the files you want to check. Click on the button  with the large green plus sign, and select the appropriate option to add files or URLs to  your list. You can add files individually, add an entire folder, or even add a URL.  1.  To check an entire site, you can add the root file for your domain from your   hard drive, or you can add the URL for the root domain.  2.  Once you have added your target, click on it. 3.  Now, click on Target in the main menu bar, then on Properties. 4.  Click on the Follow Links tab in the box that pops up, then check the box in   front of Follow and validate links.  5.  Click on the OK button and then click on the Process button to start validating.  Checking your inbound link count with  Bing Webmaster Bing Webmaster allows you to get information about backlinks, crawl errors, and  search traffic to your websites. In order to get the maximum value from this tool,  you'll need to authenticate each of your websites to prove that you own them. To get  started, go to https:  www.bing.com webmaster  and sign up with your Microsoft  account. As a part of the sign up process, you'll get a HTML file that you'll install in  the root directory of your WordPress installation. This file validates that you are the  owner of the website and entitled to see the data that Bing collects.  [ 256 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   One core use for Bing Webmaster is that it presents a highly accurate picture of  one's inbound link counts. If you recall, Google does not present accurate inbound  link counts to users. Thus, Bing Webmaster is the most authoritative picture from a  search engine that you'll have of how many backlinks your site enjoys. To see your inbound links, simply log in and navigate to the Dashboard. At the  lower right you'll see the Inbound Links table shown here:  The table shows you the inbound links to your website for each page of content.  This helpful feature lets you determine which articles of content are garnering the  most interest from the other webmasters. High link counts are always good, but you  also want to make sure you are getting high quality links from websites in the same  general category as your site. Bing offers an additional feature: link keyword research. Expand the Diagnostics &  Tools entry on the navigation bar on the left, and click Keyword Research. The search traffic section will give you valuable information about the search terms  you should be targeting for your site, as well as allowing you to see which of the  terms you are already targeting are getting traffic. Just as you did with the keywords  shown in Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools, you want to find  keywords that are getting traffic, but are not currently ranked in the top one to three  positions in the search engine results pages. Send more links to these pages with the  keyword phrase you want to target as anchor text in order to move these pages up in  the rankings.  [ 257 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Monitoring ranking positions and  movement with Rank Tracker We've tried in this book to present as many free tools as possible to help you with  your optimization. Rank Tracker is a paid tool and we've included it because it is  tremendously valuable and noteworthy. Rank Tracker is a software tool that can  monitor your website's rankings for thousands of terms in hundreds of different search  engines. Even more, it maintains a historical ranking data that helps you gauge your  progress as you work. It is a valuable tool that is used by many SEO professionals.  There is a free version, although the free version does not allow you to save your  work  and thus does not let you save historical information . To really harness the  power of this software, you'll need the paid version. You can download either version  from http:  www.link-assistant.com rank-tracker . After you install the  program, you will be prompted to enter the URL of your website. On the next screen,  the program will ask you to input the keywords you wish to track. If you have them  all listed in a spreadsheet somewhere you can just copy the column that has your  keywords in it and paste them all into the tool. Then Rank Tracker will ask you which  search engines you are targeting and will check the rank of each keyword in all of  the search engines you select. It only takes a few minutes for Rank Tracker to update  hundreds of keywords, so you can find out where you are ranking in very little time.  This screenshot shows the main interface of the Rank Tracker software. For  monitoring progress on large numbers of keywords on several different search  engines, Rank Tracker can be a real time-saver:  [ 258 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Once your rankings have been updated, you can sort them by rank to see which ones  will benefit the most from additional link building. Remember that more than half of  the people who search for something in Google click on the first result. If you are not  in the top three to five results, you will get very little traffic from people searching  for your targeted keyword. For this reason, you will usually get the best results by  working on the keywords that are ranking between 4 and 10 in the search engine  results pages. If you want more data to play with, you can click on Update KEI to find out the  keyword effectiveness index for each keyword. This tool gathers the data from  Google to tell you how many searches per month and how much competition there is  for each keyword, and then calculates the KEI score based on that data. As a general  rule, the higher the KEI number is, the easier it will be to rank for a given keyword.  Keep in mind, however, that if you are already ranking for the keyword, it will  usually not be that difficult to move up in the rankings, even if the KEI is low. To  make it easier to see which keywords will be easy to rank, they are color-coded in the  Rank Tracker tool. The easiest ones are green, and the hardest are red. Yellow and  orange fall in between.  In addition to checking your rankings on keywords you are targeting, you can use  the Rank Tracker tool to find more keywords to target. If you navigate to Tools and  then Get Keyword Suggestions, a window will pop up that will let you choose from  a range of different methods of finding keywords. It is recommended that you start  with the Google AdWords Keyword Tool. After you choose the method, you'll be  asked to enter keywords that are relevant to the content of your website. You will  only get about 100 results no matter how many keywords you enter, so it's best to  work on just one at a time. On the next page, you will be presented with a list of  keywords. Select the ones you want to add and click on Next. When the tool is done  updating the data for the selected keywords, click on the Finish button to add them  to your project.  You can repeat this process as many times as you want to find new keywords for  your website, and you can experiment with the other fifteen tools as well, which  should give you more variety. When you find keywords that look promising, put  them on a list and plan on writing posts to target those keywords in the future. Look  for keywords that have at least 100 searches per month, with a relatively low amount  of competition.  Rank Tracker not only allows you to check your current rankings, but it also keeps  track of your historical data as well. Every time you update, a new point will be  added to the progress graph so you can see your progress over time. This allows you  to see whether what you are doing is working or not. If you see that your rank is  dropping for a certain keyword, you can use that information to figure out whether  something you changed had the opposite effect that you intended.  [ 259 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you are doing SEO for clients, you'll find the reports in Rank Tracker to be  extremely useful  if not mandatory . You can create a monthly report for each client  that shows how many keywords are ranked 1, as well as how many are in the top  10, 20, or 100. The report also shows the number of keywords that moved up and the  number that moved down. You can use these reports to show your clients how much  progress you are making and demonstrate your value to the client.  If you want to take advantage of the historical data, you'll have to purchase the paid  version of Rank Tracker. The free version does not support saving your projects, so  you won't have data from your past rankings to compare and see whether you are  moving up or down in the search engine results. You also won't be able to generate  reports that tell you what has changed from the last time you updated your rankings.  Monitoring backlinks with Majestic SEO If you want to see how many backlinks you have pointing to your site, along with a  range of additional data, the king of free backlink tools is the powerful Majestic SEO  backlink checker tool. To use this tool, go to https:  majestic.com  and enter  your domain in the box at the top of the page. The tool will generate a report that  shows how many URLs are indexed for your domain, how many total backlinks  you have, and how many unique domains link to your website. For heavy-duty link  reconnaissance, you'll want the paid upgrade. Underneath the site info, you can  see the stats for each page on your site. The tool shows the number of backlinks for  each page, as well as the number of domains linking to each page. You can only see  10 results per page, so you'll have to click through numerous pages to see all of the  results if you have a large site.  Majestic SEO offers a few details that you won't get from Google or Bing Webmaster.  Majestic SEO calculates and reports the number of separate C class subnets upon  which your backlinks appear. As we have learned, links from sites on separate C  class subnets are more valuable because they are perceived by search engines as  being truly non-duplicate links. Majestic SEO also reports the number of .edu and  .gov upon which your links appear. This extra information gives you a clear picture  of how effective your link building efforts are progressing. Majestic offers another  feature of note: Majestic crawls the web more deeply, so you'll see higher link counts.  Majestic is particularly useful when doing link cleanup because it scrapes low-value  sites that Google and Bing don't bother indexing.  [ 260 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This screenshot highlights some of Majestic SEO's more robust features: it shows  you the number of backlinks from .edu and .gov domains as well as the number of  separate Class C subnets upon which your inbound links appear:  Majestic SEO offers one more special feature, it records and graphs your backlink  acquisition over time. The graph in the preceding screenshot shows this feature   in action.  Majestic SEO is not a search engine, so it will show you a count of inbound links  without any regards to the quality of the pages on which your links appear. Put  another way, Bing Webmaster will only show you links that appear on indexed  pages. Lower value pages, such as pages with duplicate content or pages in low- value link directories, tend not to appear in search engine indexes. As such, Majestic  SEO reports higher link counts than Bing Webmaster or Google.

[ 262 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   WordPress SEO Plugins  WordPress takes a lot of the work out of website design, coding, monitoring, and  SEO, by allowing you to install plugins to accomplish a variety of tasks for you.  There are WordPress plugins for almost every conceivable task. There are plugins  that can automatically add meta tags, generate internal links, check for broken links,  and more. In this Appendix, we'll cover some of the most helpful and powerful  plugins that can help you take your WordPress site to the next level. Keep in mind,  however, that plugins are only available for self-hosted WordPress sites; plugins are  not available for WordPress.com websites.  So what's changed in the plugin environment for WordPress over the past few years?  First, plugins have become generally more sophisticated and stable, which is good  news for the webmasters. Second, there has been a growth in the scope of many  plugins. For example, in previous years you might need a general SEO plugin for  controlling titles and meta tags, another plugin to clean up the WordPress head  like  the HeadSpace plugin , and yet another for controlling the noindexing of category  and tag pages. Today, the Yoast SEO plugin performs all these functions.  All in One SEO Pack All in One SEO Pack is a WordPress plugin that helps you optimize your WordPress  blog for SEO. There are several SEO plugins for WordPress, but the All in One SEO  Pack has emerged as one of the most popular and effective plugins, although it  does take second place to the immensely popular and successful Yoast SEO plugin.  If you are hung up between installing All in One SEO Pack and Yoast SEO, Yoast  is probably the better choice. Never install two full-featured SEO plugins, you'll  encounter problems.  [ 263 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you're not sure what you want it to do, you can just install and activate it, but for  the best results, you really should learn about the options that are available, and how  they affect the SEO of your website. The All in One SEO Pack supports canonical  URLs, optimizes your titles, automatically generates meta tags on each page, and  helps you avoid duplicate content. You can download the All in One SEO Pack at  http:  wordpress.org extend plugins all-in-one-seo-pack .  Yoast SEO Yoast SEO is the granddaddy of all SEO plugins. With nearly 21 million downloads,  it's easily the most widely used SEO plugin. We've discussed it throughout this book.  Yoast SEO optimizes title tags, meta tags, and even adds open graph code to your  pages and posts. There is a bit of a learning curve with Yoast SEO, so it'll take longer  to set up.  You can download Yoast SEO at https:  wordpress.org plugins wordpress-seo .  Gravity Forms Contact Form Mailer The Gravity Forms plugin allows you to create a form on your WordPress site,  and have the information submitted by the users sent to any e-mail address you  choose automatically, whenever a user submits the form. You can use this plugin  for anything, from a simple contact form to a long survey containing hundreds of  questions. For marketers concerned with reliable delivery of customer contact forms,  a great mailer plugin is a must. Gravity Forms is certainly reliable, easy to use, full- featured, and is a common choice among serious professionals. It is, however, a  paid plugin, available for $39. Curiously, the plugin is not available at WordPress. org. The Gravity Forms Contact Form Mailer can be downloaded from http:  www. gravityforms.com .  Contact Form 7 This plugin provides an easy way for you to insert a contact form on your WordPress  site. This plugin functions much like the Gravity Forms Contact Form Mailer  plugin described above, but offers less functionality than the fully paid version of  Gravity Forms. Contact Form 7 can handle multiple contact forms on the same site  and supports Akismet spam filtering and CAPTCHA. The plugin is available for  download at http:  wordpress.org extend plugins contact-form-7 .  [ 264 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Duplicate Post The Duplicate Post plugin allows you to create quick duplicates of both Pages and  Posts. This plugin is handy for creating quick alternative Pages for, say, if you want  to create six service pages for six different cities in your region. The plugin duplicates  not only the text, but all the tags, custom fields, title, and meta entries  if you are  using a SEO plugin .  The plugin gives you two different ways to create a duplicate version of any Post or  Page on your website. From the Edit posts or Edit pages navigation pages within  the dashboard, you can click on the Duplicate link for the post or page you want to  copy. You can also make a copy while you are in edit mode, by clicking on Copy to a  new draft, which appears above the Move to Trash link. Of course, once you have created a duplicate of your post using the plugin, you'll  need to edit it so that it is not exactly the same as the original. The duplicate post  gives you a good place to start if you are publishing a similar article, but you should  rewrite some portion of the content, so that the search engines will index both copies.  If you have two identical articles on your site, the search engines will pick one to  display and may ignore the other completely. The Duplicate Post plugin is a useful  tool to have if you frequently publish content that is similar to other content on your  website, such as the localized versions of the same sort of information for different  cities. You can download the Duplicate Post plugin from http:  wordpress.org  extend plugins duplicate-post .  Broken Link Checker One of the best kept secrets among power bloggers and serious SEO professionals  that work in the WordPress environment is the Broken Link Checker plugin. The  Broken Link Checker plugin constantly monitors your site for broken links, and  offers you speedy and simple choices for addressing the invalid links. The Broken  Link Checker plugin will monitor both your internal and outgoing links, even links  in the user comments and images.  [ 265 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   See the following screenshot showing the Broken Link Checker's admin area:  Broken links are listed and the plugin offers you several administration options for  addressing any dead links that the plugin discovers.  If the plugin finds any links that are no longer working, you will see a number inside  of a black circle next to Broken Links, in the left navigation bar of your admin panel.  If you click on the link, you will be taken to a page that lists all of the links that were  not working properly last time they were checked. The error status for each link is  displayed, along with the amount of time the link has been broken. Underneath each  link, you will have the option of editing the URL, unlinking it, or telling the plugin  that it is not broken. The page on which the link appears is also provided. Below the  page title, there are options to edit the article, put it in the trash, or view it.  This plugin is essential for nearly any site, especially large sites and sites that allow  public commenting on posts. It would be overly burdensome to check all of the links  on your WordPress website manually on a regular basis. Remember that search  engines are all about the user experience: search engines reward sites that keep  broken links to a minimum. You can change the options in Broken Link Checker,  to tell the plugin how often you want your links to be checked, and it runs in the  background so you never have to think about it unless a broken link is found. The  Broken Link Checker plugin can be downloaded from http:  wordpress.org  extend plugins broken-link-checker .  [ 266 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Google XML Sitemaps Google XML Sitemaps is a plugin that creates an XML sitemap for your   WordPress site, that serves as a road map for search engines so they can reliably and  effectively crawl all the content on your site. The plugin is simple to use; all you have  to do is install it and activate it. The plugin does the rest. You can download it from  http:  wordpress.org extend plugins google-sitemap-generator . After  installing the plugin, you'll want to register your sitemap by logging in to Google  Webmaster Tools at http:  www.google.com webmasters  and navigating to  Crawl and then Sitemaps.  Akismet Akismet ships with new installations of WordPress. You'll find it already installed  when you first set up your site. Akismet is a valuable anti-spam plugin that guards  against the pervasive problem of comment spam. It is very effective at preventing  spam that it blocks about 99 percent of all spam comments. You'll need to sign up at  http:  akismet.com  to get a free key to run the program. There are paid versions,  but the basic functionality is available with the free offering.  Wordfence WordPress security is an important consideration. It's a fair criticism of WordPress  to say that the platform does allow, in some configurations, a hacker to gain access to  your site. Generally, WordPress's security depends on the user keeping core files and  plugin files updated.  Wordfence doesn't replace a user's responsibility to keep WordPress updated and  secure, but offers additional layers of protection. It's very broadly featured, with  dozens of available security settings, everything from scanning core files for changes,  to blocking individual countries. The free version is certainly worthwhile, while the  paid version adds additional layers of protection. There are a lot of settings here— and that's a good thing—but it will take some time to get it set up correctly.  [ 267 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   WP Super Cache The WP Super Cache plugin reduces the load on your server by storing static  HTML files for the pages on your website and serving those, instead of running  WordPress's PHP scripts every time a page is loaded. Google will penalize your site  in the rankings if your pages take too long to load, and using a caching plugin such  as WP Super Cache helps speed up the load time. It is especially helpful to use this  type of plugin, if you have a lot of other plugins running on your website, because  each plugin is another script that must be run each time your site loads and this  slows down your load time. You can get the WP Super Cache plugin from http:   wordpress.org extend plugins wp-super-cache . WP Super Cache is installed  by default by some hosting companies. Remember to disable WP Super Cache when  making design changes to your website, so you can see your design changes in real- time, rather than seeing a cached version of your pages.  WPtouch The WPtouch plugin transforms your blog into a mobile-friendly theme, that can  be displayed on the iPhone, Android, iPod Touch, Samsung Touch, Opera Mini,  Palm Pre, and BlackBerry Storm Touch. The plugin gives your blog a mobile option  without changing your regular blog theme. Users have the option of switching  between the regular theme and the mobile theme.  WPtouch is amazingly full-featured, but with those features comes a bit of  complexity. With a little tweaking, you should be able to set up a mobile version of  your blog in about 45 minutes. WPtouch is available in both, a free and paid version  for about 40 dollars. The free version is remarkably full-featured. Keep in mind,  though, that WPtouch is a less desirable alternative to a fully responsive design. But  if your site is non-responsive and you don't have the resources for an immediate  redesign, WPtouch can serve as a suitable alternative.  You can download WPtouch from http:  wordpress.org extend plugins  wptouch .  [ 268 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   WooCommerce If you're selling products or services online, you want your website to look like a  store, not a blog. WooCommerce, from WooThemes, allows you to set up an online  e-commerce site easily using WordPress. There are other e-commerce options for  WordPress, but WooCommerce is the undisputed leader, and there is very little  reason to use any other e-commerce solution.  WooCommerce is available in both free and paid versions, with several optional  paid extensions, such as additional shipping modules and a fancy drag and drop  shopping cart widget. The free version will allow you to set up a basic shopping cart  within your WordPress installation and accept PayPal and credit card payments.  However, WooCommerce will not serve as a substitute for a dedicated shopping cart  such as Magento, which can painlessly handle tens of thousands of products, and  manage thousands of transactions. WooCommerce is for smaller e-commerce stores  with lower volume.  Download the plugin from https:  wordpress.org plugins woocommerce .  Yet Another Related Posts Plugin As the title suggests, Yet Another Related Posts Plugin  YARPP  is one of the  several related posts plugins available for WordPress. YARPP has emerged as  the most effective and widely used of this family of plugins. YARPP analyzes the  categories and tags of your Posts and automatically generates a list of related Posts  at the end of each of your blog entries, once you have the plugin installed and set up.  Including a set of related Posts tends to keep the visitors on your site longer and fully  engaged with your content. But, before you install it, make sure your template does  not have similar functionality already backed into your design.  You can set a threshold for the similarity level, so that the plugin will not display any  Posts, unless you meet the minimum level of relatedness that you require. You can  also set the plugin to ignore posts that are in certain categories, or those with specific  tags when determining which posts to display. YARPP is available for download at  http:  wordpress.org extend plugins yet-another-related-posts-plugin .  [ 269 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   FooBox HTML & Media Lightbox FooBox HTML & Media Lightbox dresses up your image galleries and images   within posts, with attractive and responsible lightbox features, and highly effective  social sharing buttons. In the screenshot below, you can see how FooBox encourages  the sharing of your images by bringing the focus of the image forward with a  lightbox effect.  FooBox integrates seamlessly with all the major WordPress gallery plugins, with  WooCommerce product images, and with Gravity Forms. FooBox is a paid plugin,  with licenses starting at $27 per year.  [ 270 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Other SEO Resources  There are many SEO resources online that can help you learn the best practices  for optimizing your websites. The algorithms used by the major search engines  are constantly changing, so you can't expect to learn everything, set your site up  according to the currently recommended SEO methods, and then forget about it. You  need to keep up with the changes that are being made so that you can determine if  and how you need to change your SEO strategy to adapt to the search algorithms  as they are updated. Here are some resources, that can help you stay on top of the  search engine optimization for your website.  Online forums Nearly all readers will be familiar with the online forums. Online forums are topical  discussion websites dedicated to a particular category or interest. There are online  forums for every conceivable topic from sports, to hotel management, to search  engine optimization. You can garner a lot of useful information from online forums  dedicated to SEO, but you can also be led down the wrong path, if you're not careful.  Some of the techniques you read about in online forums may be frowned upon by  the search engines. We've learned about black hat techniques, and in online forums,  you'll encounter both purveyors and advocates of these forbidden methods.  Every possible black hat technique ever conceived will be either described or offered  in SEO forums: automated content, automated comment posting, link farms, and  worse. We've learned, however, that all of the automated shortcuts you'll discover  will qualify as black hat or gray hat, and are to be avoided.  When participating in online forums, consider the reputation of the speaker. Most  online forums have some grading system and some even have a trading score, to  monitor how trustworthy participants have been in business transactions with other  forum members.  [ 271 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   With that in mind, here are some forums where you can learn more about Internet  marketing and SEO.  The Warrior Forum The Warrior Forum is one of the largest Internet marketing forums on the Web. It is  located at http:  www.warriorforum.com . The forum is divided into two sections:  the free forum and the War Room. There is a one-time fee of $37 to join the War  Room. Free members can read and post on the main forums, but you must be a War  Room member to access the War Room forum, post a Warrior Special Offer, create  a Warrior Forum blog, start a Warrior Forum group, or start a thread in the Warrior  joint venture forum. War Room members can also send private messages to other  members without restriction. Free members must make 50 posts before they can send  private messages.  To give you an idea of how popular the Warrior Forum is, there are often around  8000 users viewing the main Internet marketing discussion forum at one time. This  is the part of the forum where you will learn the most about Internet marketing.  The Warrior Special Offers section is the section where the War Room members can  post their own e-books and other products for sale at a special price for Warriors.  The products offered in this section must be a better deal than what is offered to the  general public. This can mean a lower price or extras that are not normally included  with the product.  The Warrior Forum also has a section where Warriors can advertise their products  and services, at their regular prices. This is the Warrior Products & Services section,  and you can find complete websites for sale, classified ads for products, and service  advertisements by Warriors who offer writing, programming, or other services. There  are also sections in the forums to discuss ad networks, offline marketing, copywriting,  AdSense, search engine optimization, and other Internet marketing topics.  The Digital Point forum The Digital Point forum is located at http:  forums.digitalpoint.com . This is  another popular forum for the SEO and Internet marketing community. There are  boards for the major search engines: Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, where you can  find information about the specific search engine you are trying to target. Some of the  other boards on the forum include general marketing, search engine optimization,  social networks, link development, pay per click advertising, and affiliate programs.  You can also find information on running an e-commerce business, designing  websites, and content management.  [ 272 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The most popular section of the Digital Point forum is the Buy, Sell, or Trade section.  If you want to buy websites or domains, this is a good place to start looking. Be  careful, though, because there have been some instances, where either the buyer  or the seller has been ripped off. It's a good idea to use an escrow service when  purchasing a domain or a website, especially if the price is high.  SEO Chat forums The SEO Chat forums located at http:  forums.seochat.com  have sections  for discussion about each of the major search engines. There are also sections for  search engine optimization, content management, affiliate marketing, keywords,  e-commerce sites, and local search. Other topics include pay per click advertising,  Google AdWords, HTML, SEO tools, analyzing website statistics, and testing SEO  strategies. The SEO Chat forums are smaller and less vital to your education than  Warrior Forum and Digital Point, but it's still worth checking out.  Google's tools for website owners Google offers a range of tools that can help with search engine optimization. We've  gone in depth with many of these resources, but here is a quick review of all of  the tools Google offers; that you can use to improve your website's search engine  optimization, as well as the tools you can use to monetize your site.  Google AdSense Google AdSense is Google's advertising revenue sharing program for publishers. If  you participate in this program, you can place Google text ads on your website and  you will receive a share of the revenue from those ads when visitors click on them.  You need to earn at least $100, before you can receive a payment.  Google AdWords Google AdWords is Google's principal pay per click advertising program. Google's  AdWords program allows you to place and purchase pay per click ads on the Google  search engine results pages, as well as on Google Content Network, which consists  of other people's websites. If you place ads through the Google Content Network  through AdWords, they could appear on any of the websites that participate in the  AdSense program.  [ 273 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Google Alerts Google Alerts is a monitoring and notification system that alerts you whenever  Google discovers new content, that includes a keyword, search term, or a phrase that  you specify. These alerts can be sent to your e-mail address, or you can subscribe to  them by RSS in any feed reader.  One way to use this service is for finding ideas to write about when you need new  content for your website. Alternatively, you can use Google alerts to learn about new  mentions of your company in links or on other websites. Let us take it a step further;  you can set alerts for your competitor's business name, and discover where they are  promoting or getting mentions. Alerts are based on query terms so get creative and  broaden your thinking, about what sorts of alerts you would like to receive. Alerts can  be particularly effective when trying to identify fresh content to share in social media.  The following screenshot shows a Google Alert that was triggered by new content  that included the search term tasty placement. This specific alert advises of a  newly-discovered Pinterest pin of content we produced:  [ 274 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Google Merchant Center Google Merchant Center is a Google service, where you can upload and manage  product listings that you want to appear in Google Product Search, AdWords, and  other Google properties. Google Merchant Center has been improved greatly in  recent years. This service has gone through several invocations and name changes in  its path to its current format. Previously, it bore the name Google Base.  If you sell tangible goods, Google Merchant Center is a mandatory additional  channel, by which you can distribute your goods. Your products will appear in  Google Product Search, and in some cases, alongside organic results in general  Google searches. Google Merchant Center is more effective if you employ automatic  data feeds to submit your products. The data feed system is well documented and  can easily accommodate tens of thousands of products.  The following screenshot shows a product view from inside the Google Merchant  Center. The analytics are helpful; you can see diagnostics and numbers of clicks for  each of your products:  [ 275 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Other helpful SEO tools Apart from the online forums and Google's robust offering, there are a range of  specialized learning and diagnostic tools. What follows are a few tools that are  especially helpful.  Copyscape Copyscape is a free and paid online service that allows you to check an article,  blog post or any piece of content, to make sure it doesn't contain content that has  already been published somewhere on the Web. This is especially helpful if you  are outsourcing the content writing for your website. Some writers may try to copy  articles they find online and pass them off as their own. You can use Copyscape to  make sure that the content you're buying is truly original. The free service is limited,  but available and helpful for occasional use. The cost of the paid service is $0.05  per credit, and it consumes one credit for each article you check. You need to buy a  minimum of 100 or 200 credits at a time, depending on your payment method. You  can find the tool at http:  www.copyscape.com.  The Pingdom Site Speed Checker Pingdom offers a free tool that allows you to test the load time of any page on your  website. The Pingdom Site Speed Checker is located at http:  tools.pingdom. com . Just type the URL of any web page in the box and click on Test Now. The test  results will tell you how long the page takes to load completely, how many files  make up the page, how many scripts and images are loaded, and more. With this  tool, you can diagnose slow loading pages. If your pages take more than three to  five seconds to load, you might consider reducing the file sizes of large image files.  Pingdom will give you the load time per element, so you'll know which files are  consuming the bulk of your load times.  In some cases, more significant problems can cause slow website loading times.  Sadly, the cause is often poor performance of the web hosting server itself. This is a  common problem on discounted shared hosting accounts. The hosting companies  often sell hosting accounts on shared servers to hundreds of webmasters. Shared  hosting means shared processing power, shared RAM, and shared bandwidth; all  this can translate into slow loading times. Pingdom's Site Speed Checker can help  you diagnose your web server's performance.  [ 276 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   HubSpot's Website Grader HubSpot is a purveyor of a reasonably effective do-it-yourself SEO solution for   non-competitive markets. For a monthly fee, you get a host of online tools and   access to consultants and webinars. The service is decent value for those willing  to do the bulk of the work themselves. Among their free offerings  intended to  introduce you to the HubSpot family of services  is HubSpot's Website Grader,  located at http:  websitegrader.com.  Just enter your website's URL and e-mail address, and the HubSpot Grader will  deliver a report, which will be sent to you that analyzes your website for a group of  optimization factors and determines a score from 1 to 100; if there is a blog on your  site, it will receive a separate grade. And yes, you have to give your e-mail so expect  some marketing pitches in your inbox.  The report also determines how many pages are indexed in Google and tells you the  readability level of your site. Other information provided in the report includes the  number of images on the page, the domain age, and the number of inbound links your  site has. The report gives suggestions on how to improve your website's grade. The  tool is a helpful one-stop glance at how effectively your optimization is progressing.

Their plans  start at $99 per month for the Pro package, which includes deep analysis for up to  five campaigns, 250 keywords, 10,000 pages, two custom Q&As, and all of the Pro  tools and guides. This software is not for the hobby blogger who is only making a  few dollars per month. It is full-featured software that is highly respected within   the industry.  [ 277 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The SEO Toolbar from Moz, on the other hand, is free, although somewhat restricted  in features. This toolbar allows you to view information about the sites you visit, as  you surf the Web. Metrics are given for Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. The toolbar also  allows you to highlight nofollow links, so you can easily see whether the links on any  given page pass link juice.  SEOmoz offers several other useful SEO tools. However, some of them require a Pro  membership to be really useful. For example, the Open Site Explorer is a backlink  checker that shows results for up to 1000 pages with a Pro membership, but free  members can only see a few. The competitive link research tool helps you find sites  your competitors are getting links from, and the juicy link finder tells you where  other sites are getting links for your target keywords, but both of these tools are  again available to Pro members only.  Other tools available through SEOmoz include a historical PageRank checker,   which can give you a history of a website's PageRank, and the Linkscape  Visualization and Comparison tool, which helps you compare the backlink profile  of your website with that of a competitor. The Link Acquisition Assistant helps you  find places where you might be able to get a high PR link for your website. You can  find the site at http:  www.moz.com.
