Vue 3 is a complete rewrite of Vue and brings changes to all the core APIs of the frameworks. This rewrite changes code that was written to flow in TypeScript. In Vue 3 we have all of the core APIs exposed, giving the possibility of using Vue to everyone.  The book starts with recipes for implementing Vue 3's new features in your web development projects and migrating your existing Vue apps to the latest version. You will get up and running with TypeScript with Vue, and find succinct solutions to common challenges and pitfalls faced in implementing components, derivatives, and animation, through to building plugins, adding state management, routing, and developing complete single-page applications  SPAs .  Some of the libraries, plugins, and frameworks used in this book might receive updates between the writing of this book and the time that you're reading it. So, please pay attention to any API changes or version changes that may have any breaking changes. Who this book is for This book is for web developers who wants to learn more about Vue and wants to improve their Vue skills. We'll start by presenting the Vue 3 and TypeScript technologies. In the subsequent chapters, the reader will be presented with the new concepts in Vue and their ecosystem plugins, UI frameworks, and advanced recipes.   By following the book from cover to cover, you will be able to create a Vue application, use all the essential Vue plugins, and employ the top Vue UI frameworks. If you are already familiar with Vue, you will discover relevant new patterns.   Preface  What this book covers Chapter 1, Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components, provides the reader with recipes on how to use the new Vue 3 APIs to create custom Vue components using Vue's exposed core API and the Composition API. This chapter also helps the reader along an initial upgrade path of a Vue 2 application to Vue 3.  Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem introduces the reader to the TypeScript superset and how to use it, starting with basic types, interfaces, and type annotations. The reader will become ready for the development of a Vue application with Vue CLI, TypeScript, and vue-class-component.  Chapter 3, Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties, discusses the basic Vue developments and component concepts, including v-model, event listeners, computed properties, and for loops. The reader will be introduced to the Vuelidate plugin for form validation and how to use it on a Vue component, along with how to debug a Vue component with vue-devtools.  Chapter 4, Components, Mixins, and Functional Components, walks the reader through building components with different approaches, including custom slots for contents, validated props, functional components, and creating mixins for code reusability. It then introduces the reader to a set of different approaches for accessing child components' data, creating a dependency injection component and dynamic injected component, and how to lazy load a component.  Chapter 5, Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests, shows the reader how to create a custom wrapper around the Fetch API for HTTP calls on JavaScript, how to use the wrapper in Vue, and how to implement custom asynchronous functions on Vue. The reader will also learn how to replace the Fetch API in the wrapper for axios, and how custom handlers can be implemented on axios.  Chapter 6, Managing Routes with vue-router, takes a look at Vue's routing plugin and how to use it on Vue to create routes for the pages of a Vue application. It introduces the process of managing router paths, dynamic paths with parameters on the router path, lazy loading the page component, creating middleware for authentication on the router, and using an alias and redirect.  [ 2 ]   Preface  Chapter 7, Managing the Application State with Vuex, explores the Vue state management plugin to help the reader understand how Vuex works and how it can be applied to their application. This chapter also provides the reader with recipes for creating Vuex modules, actions, mutations, and getters, and explores how to define the base state for the store.  Chapter 8, Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS, explores the fundamentals of CSS animation and transitions by providing recipes for custom animations based only on CSS. These will be used with a Vue custom component to achieve a nice looking application and provide the best experience for the application's users.  Chapter 9, Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks, take a look at popular UI frameworks. The reader will build a user registration form with Buefy, Vuetify, and Ant- Design with their design concept. The aim of the recipes in this chapter is to teach the reader how to create a good-looking application with a UI framework.  Chapter 10, Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms, shows how to deploy a Vue application on custom third-party hosters such as Vercel, Netlify, and Google Firebase. Using the recipes in this chapter, the reader will learn how to automatically deploy their application with integrated repository hooks and auto-deploy functions.

[ 7 ]   1  Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Vue 3 brings a lot of new features and changes for developers, all of them designed to aid development and improve the framework's overall stability, speed, and maintainability. Using other frameworks and libraries as inspiration, the Vue core team managed to achieve a great level of abstraction on the API where anyone can use Vue now, irrespective of whether they're a frontend developer or a backend developer.  In this chapter, we will learn how to upgrade our Vue project to the new version, and more about some of the new Vue features, such as the multiple root elements, the new attribute inheritance engine, how we can use the exposed reactivity API outside of Vue in another application, and how to create a component using the new composition API.  In this chapter, you will learn the following:  What is new in Vue 3 Upgrading your Vue 2 application to Vue 3 Creating components with multiple root elements Creating components with attribute inheritance Using the reactivity and observable API outside the scope of Vue Creating a component using the composition API  What is new in Vue 3 You may be wondering how a new version of a framework could result in such hype on the internet? Imagine taking a car on the highway, doing a complete 360 roll, and then continuing to go full speed ahead in the same direction. This would cause a theatrical scene, and it's the perfect way to describe how Vue will go from version 2 to 3.   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  In this first part of the chapter, I will introduce you to the improvements on Vue, what was added to the framework, what has changed, and how it will impact the way you code a Vue application.  Improvements to the framework There are numerous improvements to the Vue framework in this new release; all of them focused on making the framework better in every way possible. Here are some of the improvements that can impact the everyday development and usage of the framework by users and developers.  Under the hood The outer shell looks the same as the old one, but the engine is a piece of art. In the new version, there is no leftover code from Vue 2. The core team built the framework from the ground up using TypeScript and rewrote everything geared to the maximum performance of the framework.  TypeScript was chosen to create a more maintainable code base for the Vue core team and the open-source community, and to improve the autocomplete features, such as IntelliSense or typeahead that the IDEs and code editors provide, without the need for special plugins and extensions.  Render engine For Vue 3, a new render engine was developed using a new algorithm for the shadow DOM. This new render is totally exposed by the core of the framework by default, without the need to be executed by the framework. This makes it possible for new implementations of a completely new render function that can be injected into the framework and replace the original render engine.  In this new version of Vue, a new template compiler was written from scratch. This new compiler uses a new technique for cache manipulation and to manage the rendered elements, and a new hoisted method is applied to the creation of VNodes.  For cache manipulation, a new method is applied to control the position of the element, where the element can be a dynamic element with computed data or a response to a function that can be mutated.  [ 9 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  The Vue core team has made an explorer where it's possible to see how the new template compiler renders the final render function. This can be viewed at https: ​ ​vue-​next- template-​explorer.​netlify.​app ​.  Exposed APIs With all these modifications, it was possible to render all the Vue APIs exposed to usage within files outside the scope of application of Vue. It's possible to use the Vue reactivity or the shadow DOM in a React application, without the need to render a Vue application inside the React application. This explosibility is a way of transforming Vue into a more versatile framework, where it can be used anywhere, not just in frontend development.  New custom components Vue 3 introduces three new custom components that can be used by the developer to resolve old problems. These components were present on Vue 2 but as third-party plugins and extensions. Now they are made by the Vue core team and added to the Vue core framework.  Fragments In Vue 2, we always needed to have a parent node wrapping the components inside the single-file components. This was caused by the way in which the render engine of Vue 2 was constructed, requiring a root element on each node.  In Vue 2, we needed to have a wrapper element, encapsulating the elements that will be rendered. In the example, we have a div HTML element, wrapping two p HTML child elements, so we can achieve multiple elements on the page:             This is two       children elements         [ 10 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  Now, in Vue 3, it's possible to declare any number of root elements on the single-file components without the need for special plugins using the new Fragments API, which will handle the multiple root elements. This helps to maintain a cleaner final code for the user, without the need for empty shells just for wrapping elements:       This is two     root elements     As we saw in the Vue 3 code, we were able to have two root p HTML elements, without the need for a wrapper element.  Teleport A Teleport component, also known as a Portal component, as the name implies, is a component that can make an element go from one component to another. This may seem strange in the first instance, but it has a lot of applications, including dialogs, custom menus, alerts, badges, and many other customs UIs that need to appear in special places.  Imagine a header component, where you want a custom slot on the component so you can place components:                     Then, you want to display a custom button on this header, but you want to call this button from a page. You just need to execute the following code:                   Cake              Now, your button will be displayed on the header, but the code will be executed on the page, giving access to the page scope.  [ 11 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components Suspense When the wait for the data is taking longer than you would like, how about showing a custom loader for the user? This is now possible without the need for custom code; Vue will handle this for you. The Suspense component will manage this process, with a default view once the data is loaded, and a fallback view when the data is being loaded.  Chapter 1  You can write a special wrapper like this:                                                       The new Vue composition API will understand the current state of your component, so it will be able to differentiate if the component is loading or if it's ready to be displayed.  API changes Some API changes were made in Vue 3 that were necessary in order to clean the Vue API and simplify development. Some of them are break changes, and others are additions. But don't worry; the Vue 2 object development was not removed, it's still there, and will continue to be used. This declaration method was one of the reasons why many developers choose Vue over other frameworks.  There are some break changes that will happen in Vue 3 that are important to learn more about. We will discuss the most important break changes that will be introduced in Vue 3, and how to deal with then. In Vue 3, a new way of creating the components is being introduced – the composition API. This method will make the maintainability of your code better, and give you a more reliable code, where you will have the full power of TypeScript available.  [ 12 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components Some minor break changes There are some minor break changes that are present in Vue 3 that need to be mentioned. These changes relate to one method we used previously to write code, and that has now been replaced when using Vue 3. It's not a Herculean job, but you need to know about them.  Chapter 1  Goodbye ﬁlters, hello ﬁlters! The Vue ﬁlters API The way we used filters on Vue 2 is no longer available. The Vue filter has been removed from the API. This change was made to simplify the render process and make it faster. All filters, in the end, are functions that receive a string and return a string.  In Vue 2, we used to use filters like this:  {{ textString  filter }}  Now, in Vue 3, we just need to pass a function to manipulate the string:  {{ filter textString  }}  The bus just left the station! The event bus API In Vue 2, we were able to use the power of the global Vue object to create a new Vue instance, and use this instance as an event bus that could transport messages between components and functions without any hassle. We just needed to publish and subscribe to the event bus, and everything was perfect.  This was a good way to transfer data between components, but was an anti-pattern approach for the Vue framework and components. The correct way to transfer data between components in Vue is via a parent-child communication, or state management, also known as state-driven architecture.  In Vue 3, the $on, $off, and $once instance methods were removed. To use an event bus strategy now, it is recommended to use a third-party plugin or framework such as mitt  https: ​ ​github.​com ​developit ​mitt .  [ 13 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components No more global Vue – the mounting API In Vue 2, we were accustomed to importing Vue, and prior to mounting the application, use the global Vue instance to add the plugins, filters, components, router, and store. This was a good technique where we could add anything to the Vue instance without needing to attach anything to the mounted application directly. It worked like this:  Chapter 1  import Vue from 'vue'; import Vuex from 'vuex'; import App from '. App.vue';  Vue.use Vuex ; const store = new Vuex.store {} ;  new Vue {   store,   render:  h  => h App , } .$mount 'app' ;  import { createApp } from 'vue'; import { createStore } from 'vuex'; import App from '. App.vue';  const store = createStore {} ;  createApp App    .use store    .mount 'app' ;  Now, in Vue 3, this is no longer possible. We need to attach every component, plugin, store, and router to the mounted instance directly:  Using this method, we can create different Vue applications in the same global application, without the plugins, store, or router of the applications messing with one another.  v-model, v-model, v-model – multiple v-model When developing a single-file component, we were stuck with a single v-model directive and a .sync option for a second update change. This meant us using a lot of custom event emitters and huge object payloads to handle data inside the component.  In this breaking change, a collateral break change was introduced that resulted in the model property  https: ​ ​vuejs.​org ​v2 ​api ​model  being removed from the Vue API. This property is used in custom components that used to do the same thing that the new v-model directive now does.  [ 14 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  The new way to use the v-model directive will change how the sugar syntax works. In Vue 2, to use a v-model directive, we had to create a component expecting to receive the props as "value", and when there was a change, we needed to emit an 'input' event, like the following code:      <input     :value="value"     @input="$emit 'input', $event "    >     export default {   props: {     value: String,   }, }    In Vue 3, to make the syntactic sugar work, the props property that the component will receive and the event emitter will change. Now, the component expects a props named modelValue and it emits an event, 'update:modelValue', like the following code:      <input     :modelValue="modelValue"     v-on:['update:modelValue']="$emit 'update:modelValue', $event "    >     export default {   props: {     modelValue: String,   }, }    But how about the multiple v-model directives? Understanding the v-model break change is the first step in getting to know how the new method of multiple v-model will work.  [ 15 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  To create multiple v-model components, we need to create various props with the name of the model directive we want and emit 'update:value' events where the value is the name of the model directive:    export default {   props: {     name: String,     email: String,   },   methods: {    updateUser name, email  {     this.$emit 'update:name', name ;     this.$emit 'update:email', email ;    }   } }        <custom-component     v-model:name="name"     v-model:email="email"    >    In the component where we want to use the multiple v-model directives, use the following code:  The component will have each v-model directive, bounded to the event the child is emitting. In this case, the child component emits 'update:email'  the parent component  in order to be able to use the v-model directive with the email modifier. For example, you can use v-model:email to create the two-way data binding, between the component and the data.  Composition API This is one of the most anticipated features of Vue 3. The composition API is a new way of creating Vue components, with an optimized way of writing code, and providing full TypeScript type checking support in your component. This method organizes the code in a simpler and more efficient way.  [ 16 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  In this new way of declaring a Vue component, you just have a setup property that will be executed and will return everything your component needs in order to be executed, like this example:       {{ state.count }}      import { reactive, ref } from 'vue';  export default {   setup  {     const state = reactive {       count: ref 0      } ;      const increaseCounter =    => {       state.count += 1;     }      return { state, increaseCounter }   } }    You will import the reactivity API from the Vue core to enable it in the object type data property, in this case, state. The ref API enables reactivity in the basic type value, like count, which is a number.  Finally, the functions can be declared inside the setup functions and passed down on the returned object. Then, everything is accessible in the   section.  Now, let's move on to some recipes.  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.  Attention Windows users! You need to install an NPM package called windows-build-tools to be able to install the following requisite packages. To do this, open Power Shell as an administrator and execute the following command: > npm install -g windows-build-tools  [ 17 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  Creating the base file In all recipes in this chapter, we will use this base template which we will create now. Make sure you follow these steps to create the file before starting the example in the recipe:  1. 2.  Create a new .html file in any folder and open it. Create an html tag and add a head HTML element as a child. Inside the head HTML element, add a script HTML element with the src attribute defined as http:  unpkg.com vue@next:                      3.  As a sibling of the  head HTML element, create a body HTML element. Inside the body HTML element, add a div HTML element with the attribute id defined as "app":                   4.  Finally, as a sibling of the div HTML element, create a script HTML element, with empty content. This will be where we will place the code for the recipes:  Upgrading your Vue 2 application to Vue 3 Upgrading your project from Vue 2 to Vue 3 can sometimes be done automatically, but in other cases, this needs to be done manually. This depends on how deep into the use of the Vue API you go with your application.  [ 18 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  With projects made and managed by Vue-CLI, this process will be made seamlessly and will have a more straightforward approach compared to projects using a custom framework wrapper CLI.  In this recipe, you will learn how to upgrade your application using Vue-CLI and how to upgrade the project and the dependencies manually.  Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... In order to upgrade your Vue 2 project to Vue 3, you will have to split the upgrade into different parts. We have the upgrade of the framework itself, and then we have the ecosystem components, such as vue-router and vuex, and finally, the bundler that joins  everything in the end.  The framework upgrade comes with break changes. There are some break changes that are presented in this book in the What is new in Vue 3 section of this chapter, and others that may occur in a more advanced API schema. You have to manually update and check whether your components are valid for the upgrade on the framework.  Using Vue-CLI to upgrade the project Using the latest version of Vue-CLI, you will be able to use Vue 3 in your project, out of the box, and you will be able to update your current project to Vue 3.  [ 19 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  To update Vue-CLI to the latest version, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install @vue cli-service@latest  Upgrading the project manually To upgrade the project manually, you will have to first upgrade the project dependencies to their latest versions. You cannot use an old version of a Vue ecosystem plugin with Vue 3. To do this, perform the following steps:  1.  We need to upgrade the Vue framework, the ESLint plugin  which Vue depends on , and the vue-loader for the bundler. To upgrade it, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install vue@next eslint-plugin-vue@next vue-loader@next  2.  We need to add the new Vue single-file component compiler as a dependency to the project. To install it, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install @vue compiler-sfc@latest  3.  If you are using unit tests and the @vue test-utils package on your project, you will also need to upgrade this dependency. To upgrade it, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install @vue test-utils@next @vue server-test-utils@latest  4.  For the Vue ecosystem plugins, if you are using vue-router, you will need to upgrade this too. To upgrade it, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install vue-router@next  5.  If your application is using vuex as the default state management, you will need to upgrade this too. To upgrade it, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install vuex@next  [ 20 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components Changing the starting ﬁles With the new version of the packages, we will need to change our starting files. In a Vue project that was created with the Vue-CLI starter kit, you will find a file named main.js or main.ts. If you are using TypeScript, this file is located in the src folder. Now follow these instructions:  Chapter 1  1.  Open the main.js file in the src folder of your project. At the top of the file, where the packages are imported, you will see the following code:  import Vue from 'vue';  We need to change this to the new Vue exposed API method. To do this, we need to import createApp from the Vue package as follows:  import { createApp } from 'vue';  2.  3.  Remove the global Vue static attribute definition of Vue.config.productionTip from your code. The mounting function of your application needs to be changed. The old API will look like this:  The old API should be changed to the new createApp API, as follows:  4.  5.  Open your vuex store instantiation file  normally, this file is located in src store and is named store.js or index.js . Change the creation of the store from the instantiation of a new vuex class to the new createStore API. The vuex v3 class instantiation may look like this:  new Vue {   router,   store,   render:  h  => h App , } .$mount 'app' ;  createApp App    .use router    .use store    .mount 'app'   import Vue from 'vue'; import Vuex from 'vuex';  Vue.use Vuex ;  export default new Vuex.Store {  [ 21 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  You need to replace its content with the createStore API, which could look like this, for example:    state: {  * ... *  },   mutations: {  * ... *  },   actions: {  * ... *  },   getters: {  * ... *  },   modules: {  * ... *  }, } ;  import { createStore } from 'vuex';  export default createStore {   state: {  * ... *  },   mutations: {  * ... *  },   actions: {  * ... *  },   getters: {  * ... *  },   modules: {  * ... *  }, } ;  6.  7.  In the vue-router ecosystem, we will need to replace the old API from the router creation with the new one. To do this, open the router creation file  in the src router folder, normally named router.js or index.js . Finally, in the creation file, replace the old vue-router class instantiation with the new createRouter API. The vue-router v3 class instantiation may look like this:  import Vue from 'vue'; import VueRouter from 'vue-router';  Vue.use VueRouter ;  export default new VueRouter {   routes: [{     path: ' ',     name: 'HomePage',     component:    => import 'pages home' ,   }] } ;  import {   createRouter,   createWebHistory, } from 'vue-router';  [ 22 ]  You will also need to replace the new VueRouter instantiation with the new createRouter and createWebHistory API, as in this example:   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  Vue.use VueRouter ;  export default createRouter {   history: createWebHistory  ,   routes: [{     path: ' ',     name: 'HomePage',     component:    => import 'pages home' ,   }] } ;  How it works... In the upgrading process, Vue has provided us with two ways to update our project. The first way is to use the Vue-CLI plugin, which tries to automate almost all the processes and changes needed for the upgrade.  The second way is to upgrade the project manually. This method requires the developer to upgrade all the dependencies to the latest version, install the new single-file component compiler, @vue compiler-sfc, and change the entry files for the Vue application, router, and store to the new API.  Following the changes to the starter structure of the project, the developer needs to check the components to see whether there are any Vue 3 breaking changes present, refactor the component to the new Vue 3 APIs, and remove the deprecated APIs from Vue 2.  Creating components with multiple root elements In Vue 3, it is possible to create components with multiple root elements, without the need for a wrapping element. This option is also known as a fragment.  In React, this has been possible for a long time, but in Vue, you need to use custom third- party plugins such as vue-fragment  https: ​ ​github.​com ​Thunberg087 ​vue-​fragment  to use this feature.  In this recipe, you will learn how to create a component with multiple root elements, and how it could be used with a   section and a render function.  [ 23 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components How to do it... In this recipe, we will create two examples of a multiple root element component, one with a   structure, and another with a render function. To do this, this recipe will be divided into two parts.  Chapter 1  Creating the component with the   structure In order to use the   structure in our example, we will be using the template property of the Vue object where we can pass a string or a template string as the value, which will be interpolated by the Vue script and rendered on the screen:  1.  2.  Using the base example from the 'Creating the base file' section, create a new file named template.html and open it. In the empty   HTML element, create the constants defineComponent and createApp by object-destructuring the Vue global constant:  const {   defineComponent,   createApp, } = Vue;  3.  Create a constant named component, defined as the defineComponent method, passing a JavaScript object as an argument with three properties: data, methods, and template:  const component = defineComponent {  data:    =>  {} ,  methods: {},  template: `` } ;  data:    =>  {   count: 0 } ,  4.  In the data property, define it as a singleton function, returning a JavaScript object, with a property named count and with the default value as 0:  [ 24 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  5.  In the methods property, create a property called addOne, which is a function that will increase the value of count by 1:  6.  In the template property, in the template string, create an h1 HTML element with a title. Then, as a sibling, create a button HTML element with an event listener bound to the click event, triggering the addOne function when executed:  methods: {   addOne   {     this.count += 1;   }, },  template: `         This is a Vue 3 Root Element!             Pressed {{ count }} times.     `  7.  Finally, call the createApp function, passing the component constant as an argument. Then, prototype chain the mount function and, as an argument of the function, pass the div HTML element id attribute,  "app" :  createApp component    .mount 'app' ;  Creating the component with the render function In order to use the   structure in our example, we will be using the template property of the Vue object, where we can pass a string or a template string as the value, which will be interpolated by the Vue script and rendered on the screen:  1.  Using the base example from the 'Creating the base file' section, create a new file named render.html and open it.  [ 25 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  2.  In the empty   HTML element, create the constants of the functions that will be used using the object destructuring method, calling the defineComponent, h, and createApp methods from the Vue global constant:  3.  Create a constant named component, defined as the defineComponent method, passing a JavaScript object as an argument with three properties: data, methods, and render:  const component = defineComponent {   data:    =>  {} ,   methods: {},   render   {}, } ;  4.  In the data property, define it as a singleton function, returning a JavaScript object with a property named count and with the default value as 0:  5.  In the methods property, create a property called addOne, which is a function that will increase the value of count by 1:  const {   defineComponent,   h,   createApp, } = Vue;  data:    =>  {   count: 0 } ,  methods: {   addOne   {     this.count += 1;   }, },  6.  In the render property, perform the following steps:  Create a constant named h1 and define it as the h function, passing 'h1' as the first argument, and the title that will be used as the second argument. Create a constant named button, which will be the h function, passing "button" as the first argument, a JavaScript object with the property onClick with a value of this.addOne as the second argument, and the content of button as the third argument.  [ 26 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  Return an array, with the first value as the h1 constant, and the second value as the button constant:  render   {   const h1 = h 'h1', 'This is a Vue 3 Root Element!' ;   const button = h 'button', {       onClick: this.addOne,     }, `Pressed ${this.count} times.` ;    return [     h1,     button,   ]; },  createApp component    .mount 'app' ;  7.  Finally, call the createApp function, passing the component constant as an argument, prototype chaining the mount function, and passing the div HTML element id attribute,  "app" , as an argument of the function:  How it works... The new Vue component creation API needs to be executed by a function, defineComponent, and the JavaScript object that is passed as an argument maintains almost the same structure as the old structure in Vue 2. In the examples, we used the same properties, data, render, methods, and template, all present in Vue 2.  In the example with the   structure, we didn't have to create a wrapper element to encapsulate the content of our application component and were able to have two root elements on the component directly.  In the render function example, the same behavior occurs, but the final example used the new exposed h API, where it is no longer a parameter of the render function. A breaking change was present in the example; in the button creation, we had to use the onClick property inside the data JavaScript object, not the on property, with the click method. This happens because of the new data structure of the VNode of Vue 3.  [ 27 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  Creating components with attribute inheritance Since Vue 2, it has been possible to use attribute inheritance on components, but in Vue 3, attribute inheritance was made better and with a more reliable API to use in the components.  Attribute inheritance in components is a pattern that provides faster development of custom components based on HTML elements  such as custom inputs, buttons, text wrappers, or links .  In this recipe, we will create a custom input component with attribute inheritance applied directly to the input HTML element.  How to do it... Here, we will create a component that will have a full attribute inheritance on a selected element on the DOM tree:  1.  2.  Using the base example from the Creating the base file section, create a new file named component.html and open it. In the empty   HTML element, create the constants of the functions that will be used using the object destructuring method, calling the defineComponent and createApp methods from the Vue global constant:  const {   defineComponent,   createApp, } = Vue;  3.  Create a constant named nameInput, defined as the defineComponent method, passing a JavaScript object as an argument with four properties: name, props, template, and inheritAttrs. Then, we define the  value of inheritAttrs as false:  const nameInput = defineComponent {   name: 'NameInput',   props: {},   inheritAttrs: false,   template: `` } ;  [ 28 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  4.  In the props property, add a property called modelValue and define it as String:  props: {   modelValue: String, },  5.  In the template property, within the template string, we need to do the following: Create a label HTML element and add an input HTML element as a child. In the input HTML element, define the v-bind directive as a JavaScript object with the destructed value of this.$attrs. Define the variable attribute value as the received prop's modelValue. Set the input attribute type as "text". To the change event listener, add an anonymous function, which receives an event as the argument, and then emit an event called "update:modeValue" with the payload event.target.value:  template: `     <input     v-bind="{       ...$attrs,     }"     :value="modelValue"     type="text"     @change=" event  => $emit 'update:modelValue',                              event.target.value "    >  `  6.  Create a constant named appComponent, defined as the defineComponent method, passing a JavaScript object as an argument with two properties, data and template:  const component = defineComponent {   data:    =>  {} ,   template: ``, } ;  [ 29 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  7.  In the data property, define it as a singleton function, returning a JavaScript object with a property named name, with the default value as '':  data:    =>  {   name: '' } ,  8.  In the template property, within the template string, we need to do the following: Create a NameInput component with a v-model directive bounded to the name data property. Create a style attribute with the value "border:0; border- bottom: 2px solid red;". Create a data-test attribute with the value "name-input":  template: ` <name-input   v-model="name"   style="border:0; border-bottom: 2px solid red;"   data-test="name-input"  >`  9.  Create a constant named app, and define it as the createApp function, passing the component constant as the argument. Then, call the app.component function, passing as the first argument the name of the component you want to register, and as the second argument the component. Finally, call the app.mount function, passing "app" as the argument:  const app = createApp component ; app.component 'NameInput', nameInput ; app.mount 'app' ;  How it works... In Vue 3, in order to create a component, we need to execute the defineComponent function, passing a JavaScript object as an argument. This object maintains almost the same component declaration structure as Vue 2. In the examples, we used the same properties, data, methods, props, and template, all present in the V2.  We used the inheritAttrs property to block the auto application of the attributes to all elements on the components, applying them just to the element with the v-bind directive and with the this.$attrs object deconstructed.  [ 30 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  To register the component in the Vue application, we first created the application with the createApp API and then executed the app.component function to register the component globally on the application, prior to rendering our application.  Using the reactivity and observable API outside the scope of Vue In Vue 3, with the exposed APIs, we can use the Vue reactivity and reactive variables without the need to create a Vue application. This enables backend and frontend developers to take full advantage of the Vue reactivity API within their application.  In this recipe, we will create a simple JavaScript animation using the reactivity and watch APIs.  How to do it... Here, we will create an application using the Vue exposed reactivity API to render an animation on the screen:  1.  2.  3.  Using the base example from the 'Creating the base file' section, create a new file named reactivity.html and open it. In the   tag, add a new   tag with the attribute chartset defined as "utf-8":     In the   tag, remove the divapp HTML element, and create a div HTML element with the id defined as marathon and the style attribute defined as "font-size: 50px;":  <div   id="marathon"   style="font-size: 50px;" >    [ 31 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  4.  In the empty   HTML element, create the constants of the functions that will be used using the object destructuring method, calling the reactivity and watch methods from the Vue global constant:  const {   reactive,   watch, } = Vue;  5.  Create a constant named mod, defined as a function, which receives two arguments, a and b. This then returns an arithmetic operation, a modulus b:  const mod =  a, b  =>  a % b ;  6.  Create a constant named maxRoadLength with the value 50. Then, create a constant named competitor with the value as the reactivity function, passing a JavaScript object as the argument, with the position property defined as 0 and speed defined as 1:  const maxRoadLength = 50; const competitor = reactive {   position: 0,   speed: 1, } ;  7.  Create a watch function, passing an anonymous function as the argument. Inside the function, do the following:  Create a constant named street, and define it as an Array with a size of maxRoadLength, and fill it with '_'. Create a constant named marathonEl, and define it as the HTML DOM node, marathon. Select the element on the street in the array index  of competitor.position and define it as "  " if  the competitor.position number is even, or " odd. Define marathonEl.innertHTML as "" and street.reverse  .join '' :  " if the number is  [ 32 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  The emojis used in this recipe are Person Running and Person Walking. The emoji image may vary depending on your OS. The images presented in this recipe are the emojis for the Apple OS.  watch    => {   const street = Array maxRoadLength .fill '_' ;   const marathonEl = document.getElementById 'marathon' ;   street[competitor.position] =  competitor.position % 2 === 1       ? '  '      : '  ';    marathonEl.innerHTML = '';   marathonEl.innerHTML = street.reverse  .join '' ; } ;  8.  Create a setInterval function, passing an anonymous function as the argument. Inside the function, define competitor.position as the mod function, passing competitor.position plus competitor.speed as the first argument, and maxRoadLength as the second argument:  setInterval    => {   competitor.position = mod competitor.position +competitor.speed,     maxRoadLength  }, 100 ;  How it works... Using the exposed reactive and watch APIs from Vue, we were able to create an application with the reactivity present in the Vue framework, but without the use of a Vue application.  First, we created a reactive object, competitor, that works in the same way as the Vue data property. Then, we created a watch function, which works in the same way as the watch property, but is used as an anonymous function. In the watch function, we made the road for the competitor to run on, and created a simple animation, using two different emojis, changing it based on the position on the road, so that it mimics an animation on the screen.  [ 33 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  Finally, we printed the current runner on the screen and created a setInterval function of every 100ms to change the position of the competitor on the road:  Creating a component using the composition API The composition API is a new way to write Vue components, based on the use of functions to compose the component, and it makes the organization and reusability of the code better.  This method is inspired by React Hooks and introduces the technique of creating a special function to compose the applications that can be shared without the need to be inside the Vue application because of the use of the exposed Vue APIs.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create an external function that fetches the user's geolocation and displays that data on the screen using the composition API.  [ 34 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components How to do it... Here, we will create a component using the composition API, which will fetch the user GPS position and show that information on the screen:  Chapter 1  1.  2.  Using the base example from the 'Creating the base file' section, create a new file named component.html and open it. In the empty   HTML element, create the constants of the functions that will be used using the object destructuring method, calling the createApp, defineComponent, setup, ref, onMounted, and onUnmounted methods from the Vue global constant:  const {   createApp,   defineComponent,   setup,   ref,   onMounted,   onUnmounted, } = Vue;  3.  Create a fetchLocation function and, inside this, create a let variable named watcher. Then, create a constant named geoLocation and define it as navigator.geolocation. Next, create a constant named gpsTime and define it as the ref function, passing the Date.now   function as the argument. Finally, create a constant named coordinates and define it as the ref function, passing a JavaScript object as the argument, with the properties accuracy, latitude, longitude, altitude, altitudeAccuracy, heading, and speed defined as 0:  function fetchLocation   {   let watcher;   const geoLocation = navigator.geolocation;   const gpsTime = ref Date.now   ;   const coordinates = ref {     accuracy: 0,     latitude: 0,     longitude: 0,     altitude: 0,     altitudeAccuracy: 0,     heading: 0,     speed: 0,   } ; }  [ 35 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  4.  Then, inside the fetchLocation function, following the creation of the constants, create a function named setPosition with a parameter named payload. Inside the function, define gpsTime.value as the payload.timestamp argument and coordinates.value as the payload.coords argument:  function setPosition payload  {   gpsTime.value = payload.timestamp   coordinates.value = payload.coords }  5.  Following creation of the setPosition function, call the onMounted function, passing an anonymous function as the argument. Inside the function, check  whether the browser has the geoLocation API available, and define watcher as the geoLocation.watchPostion function, passing the setPosition function as the argument:  onMounted    => {   if  geoLocation  watcher = geoLocation.watchPosition setPosition ; } ;  6.  After calling the onMounted function, create an onUnmounted function passing an anonymous function as the argument. Inside the function, check whether watcher is defined and then execute the geoLocation.clearWatch function, passing watcher as the argument:  onUnmounted    => {   if  watcher  geoLocation.clearWatch watcher ; } ;  7.  Finally, in the fetchLocation function, return a JavaScript object, and as the properties values define, pass the coordinates and gpsTime constants:  return {   coordinates,   gpsTime, };  [ 36 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  8.  Create a constant named appComponent and define it as the defineComponent function, passing a JavaScript object with the properties setup and template as the argument:  const appComponent = defineComponent {   setup   {},   template: `` } ;  9.  In the setup function, create a constant, which is an object destructuring with the properties coordinates and gpsTime of the fetchLocation function:  10.  Inside the setup function, create another constant named formatOptions, and define it as a JavaScript object with the properties year, month, day, hour, and minute as 'numeric'. Then, define the property hour12 as true:  setup   {   const {     coordinates,     gpsTime,   } = fetchLocation  ; }  const formatOptions = {     year: 'numeric',     month: 'numeric',     day: 'numeric',     hour: 'numeric',     minute: 'numeric',     hour12: true,   };  11.  Following the creation of the formatOptions constant, create a constant named formatDate and define it as a function, which receives a parameter named date. Then, return a new Intl.DateTimeFormat function, passing navigator.language as the first argument, and the formatOption constant as the second argument. Then, prototype chain the format function, passing the date parameter:  const formatDate =  date  =>  new   Intl.DateTimeFormat navigator.language,      formatOptions .format date  ;  [ 37 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components  Chapter 1  12.  Finally, at the end of the setup function, return a JavaScript object with the properties defined as coordinates, gpsTime, and formatDate constants:  return {   coordinates,   gpsTime,   formatDate };  13.  In the template property, do the following:  Create an h1 HTML element with the text "My Geo Position at {{ formatDate new Date gpsTime  }}". Create a ul HTML element and add three li HTML elements as children. In the first child element, add the text "Latitude: {{ coordinates.latitude }}". In the second child element, add the text "Longitude: {{ coordinates.longitude }}". In the third child element, add the text "Altitude: {{ coordinates.altitude }}":  template: `    My Geo Position at {{formatDate new                           Date gpsTime  }}           Latitude: {{ coordinates.latitude }}       Longitude: {{ coordinates.longitude }}       Altitude: {{ coordinates.altitude  }}      `  14.  Finally, call the createApp function, passing the appComponent constant as an argument. Then, prototype chain the mount function, and, as an argument of the function, pass the div HTML element id attribute,  "app" :  createApp appComponent    .mount 'app' ;  [ 38 ]   Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components How it works... In this recipe, first, we imported the exposed APIs -  createApp,  defineComponent, setup, ref, onMounted, and onUnmounted, – as constants, which we will use to create the component. Then, we created the fetchLocation function, which has the responsibility of getting the user's geolocation data and returning it as reactive data that can be automatically updated when the user changes their location.  Chapter 1  The ability to fetch the user GPS positions was possible because of the navigator.geolocation API present on modern browsers, which are able to fetch the user's current GPS position. Using this data provided by the browser, we were able to use it to define the variables created with the Vue ref APIs.  We created the component using the setup function of the Vue object declaration, so the rendering knows that we are using the new composition API as the component creation method. Inside the setup function, we imported the dynamic variables of the fetchLocation function and created a method that formats the date to use as a filter on the template.  Then we returned the imported variables and the filter, so they can be used on the template section. In the template section, we created a title adding the time of the last GPS position, used the filter to format it, and created a list of the user's latitude, longitude, and altitude.  Finally, we created the application using the createApp exposed API and mounted the Vue application.

[ 39 ]   2  Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  TypeScript is a new Vue-based language, fully supported on Vue 3. It is now possible to use typed JSX  also know as TSX , type annotation, static verification of the code, and much more.   The Vue ecosystem is getting bigger each day, so to help us, the Vue team has developed some tools to improve project handling and management. Those tools are Vue CLI and Vue UI, which today are the main tools for local Vue development.  The Vue CLI tool is the beginning of every project; with it, you will be able to select the basic features or just a preset you had made, to create a new Vue project. After a project is created, you can use Vue UI to manage the project, add new features, check the status of the project, and do almost everything you previously needed to do in the command-line interface  CLI , with the addition of more features.  In these chapters, you learn more about TypeScript as a superset on JavaScript and how to use the power of the Vue CLI tool and Vue UI together to get a whole application up and running.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Creating a TypeScript project Understanding TypeScript Creating your first TypeScript class Creating your first project with Vue CLI Adding plugins to a Vue CLI project with Vue UI Adding TypeScript to a Vue CLI project   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  Creating your first TypeScript Vue component with vue-class-component Creating a custom mixin with vue-class-component Creating a custom function decorator with vue-class-component Adding custom hooks to vue-class-component Adding vue-property-decorator to vue-class-component  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js, Vue CLI, and TypeScript.  Attention, Windows users—you need to install an npm package called windows-build-tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do it, open PowerShell as administrator and execute the following command:  > npm install -g windows-build-tools.  To install the Vue CLI tool, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  To install TypeScript, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g typescript  Creating a TypeScript project TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that, when compiled, gives us plain JavaScript code. It seems like a new language, but in the end, it's still JavaScript.   What is the advantage of using TypeScript? The main advantage is the typed syntax, which helps with static checking and code refactoring. You can still use all the JavaScript libraries and program with the latest ECMAScript features out of the box.  When compiled, TypeScript will deliver a pure JavaScript file that can run on any browser, Node.js, or any JavaScript engine that is capable of executing ECMAScript 3 or newer versions.  [ 41 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem Getting ready To start our project, we will need to create an npm project. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  Chapter 2  > npm init -y  You also need to install TypeScript, so open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install typescript --only=dev  How to do it... With our environment ready, we will need to start our TypeScript project. Let's create a .ts file and compile it:  1.  To start our TypeScript project, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > tsc --init  This will create a tsconfig.json file inside our folder. This is a compiler settings file. Here, you can define the target, which JavaScript libraries will be  available on the development, the target ECMAScript version, the module generation, and much more.  When developing for the web, don't forget to add the Document Object Model  DOM  to the libraries on the compilerOption property inside the tsconfig.json file so that you can have access to the window and document object when developing.  2.  Now, we need to create our index.ts file. Let's create some simple code inside the index.ts file that will log a math calculation in your terminal:  function sum a: number, b: number : number {     return a + b; }  const firstNumber: number = 10;  const secondNumber: number = 20;  console.log sum firstNumber, secondNumber  ;  [ 42 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  This function receives two parameters, a and b, which both have their type set to number, and the function is expected to return a number. We made two variables, firstNumber and secondNumber, which in this case are both set to a number type—10 and 20 respectively—so, it's valid to pass to the function. If we had set it to any other type such as a string, Boolean, float, or an array, the compiler would have thrown an error about the static type checking on the variable and the function execution.  3.  Now, we need to compile this code to a JavaScript file. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > tsc . index.ts  After the compilation, we can see the final file in index.js. If we look inside the file, the final code will be similar to this:  function sum a, b  {     return a + b; } var firstNumber = 10; var secondNumber = 20; console.log sum firstNumber, secondNumber  ;  You may be wondering: where are my types? As ECMAScript is a dynamic language, the types of TypeScript exist only at the superset level, and won't be passed down to the JavaScript file.  Your final JavaScript will be in the form of a transpiled file, with the configurations defined in the tsconfig.json file.  How it works... When we create our TypeScript project, a file named tsconfig.json is created inside our folder. This file coordinates all the rules on the compiler and the static type checking during the development process. All developments are based on the rules defined in this file. Each environment depends on specific rules and libraries that need to be imported.  When developing, we can assign types directly to constants, variables, function parameters, returns, and much more. These types of definitions can prevent basic type errors and code refactoring.  [ 43 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  After the development is done and we compile the project, the final product will be a pure JavaScript file. This file won't have any type of checking, due to the dynamic type of JavaScript.  This JavaScript file gets transpiled to the target model and defined on the configuration file, so we can execute it without any problems.

There is a guide to migrating from JavaScript at https: ​ ​www.​typescriptlang.​org ​docs  handbook ​migrating-​from-​javascript.​html.  A 5-minute lesson for TypeScript can be found at https: ​ ​www.​typescriptlang.​org ​docs  handbook ​typescript-​in-​5-​minutes.​html.  Understanding TypeScript TypeScript is a type-based language. Much of its power comes with the ability to use static code analysis with JavaScript. This is possible thanks to the tools that exist inside the TypeScript environment.  These tools include the compiler, which can provide static analysis during development and after compilation, and the ECMAScript transpiler, which can make your code available to run on almost any JavaScript engine.  Let's get to know more about the language, and how it works.  Getting ready To start, we will need to create an npm project. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm init -y  [ 44 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  You also need to install TypeScript, so open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install typescript --only=dev  Types The main feature we get from using TypeScript is the types. In this section, we will learn about types, how to declare them, and how to use them.  These are some of the basic types in a statically typed language:  String Number Boolean Arrays Tuple Enum Any Void Objects   Let's talk about some of these types and show how they can be used in TypeScript.   String All the textual data on JavaScript will be treated as a string. To declare a string, we always  need to surround it with double  "  or single  '  quotes, or the  `  grave accent, commonly known as a template string.  Declaring template strings inside text is not a problem with TypeScript. Template strings are a feature in ECMAScript that made it possible to add a variable inside a string without the need for concatenation:  const myText: string = 'My Simple Text'; const myTextAgain: string = "My Simple Text"; const greeting: string = `Welcome back ${myName}!`;  [ 45 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem Number In JavaScript, all numbers are floating-point values. In TypeScript, it's the same. Those  numbers get a number type. In addition to the hexadecimal and decimal numbers, the binary and octal literals that were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 are treated like numbers too:  Chapter 2  const myAge: number = 31; const hexNumber: number = 0xf010d; const binaryNumber: number = 0b1011; const octalNumber: number = 0o744;  Boolean The most basic type in the programming languages is the boolean values—a simple 1 or 0, and true or false. This is called a boolean:  const isTaskDone: boolean = false; const isGreaterThen: boolean = 10 > 5;  Arrays A group of elements in most of the languages is commonly called an array. In TypeScript, we can declare it in two different ways.   The most simple way is just to declare the type of the element followed by []  square brackets  to denote that it is an array of the declared type:  const primeNumbers: number[] = [1, 3, 5, 7, 11];  Or, you can declare generically, using the Array  declaration. This is not the most common way used, but, depending on the code you are developing, you may need to use it:  const switchInstructions: Array  = [true, false, false, true];  [ 46 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem Tuple Tuples are a type of variable that has a specific structure. Structurally, a tuple is an array of two elements; both are a known type by the compiler and the user, but those elements don't need to have the same type:  Chapter 2  let person: [string, number]; person = ['Heitor', 31];  console.log `My name is ${person[0]} and I am ${person[1]} years old` ;  If you try to access an element outside of the known indices, you will get an error.  Enum Enums are similar to JavaScript objects, but they have some special attributes that help in the development of your application. You can have a friendly name for numeric values or a more controlled environment for the constants on the variables a function can accept.  A numeric enum can be created without any declaration. By doing this, it will start with the initial values of 0 and finish with the value of the final index number; or, you can get the name of the enum, passing the index of the enum value:  console.log ErrorLevel.Error ;    3 console.log ErrorLevel[3] ;    Error  Or, an enum can be declared with values. It can be an initial declaration that the TypeScript compiler will interpret the rest of the elements as an increment of the first one, or an individual declaration:  enum ErrorLevel {     Info,     Debug,     Warning,     Error,     Critical, }  enum Color {     Red = 'FF0000',     Blue = '0000FF',     Green = '00FF00', }  enum Languages {     JavaScript = 1,  [ 47 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2      PHP,     Python,     Java = 10,     Ruby,     Rust,     TypeScript, }  console.log Color.Red     'FF0000' console.log Languages.TypeScript     13  Any As JavaScript is a dynamic language, TypeScript needed to implement a type that has no defined value, so it implemented the any type. The most used case for the any type any is when using values that came from a third-party library. In that case, we know that we are dropping the type checking:  let maybeIs: any = 4; maybeIs = 'a string?'; maybeIs = true;  The main use of the any type is when you are upgrading a legacy JavaScript project to TypeScript, and you can gradually add the types and validations to the variables and functions.   Void As the opposite of any, void is the absence of the type at all. The most used case is with functions that won't return any values:  function logThis str: string : void{     console.log str ; }  Using void to type a variable is useless because it only can be assigned to undefined and null.  Objects An object in TypeScripts has a special form of declaring because it can be declared as an interface, as a direct object, or as a type of its own.  [ 48 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  Declaring an object as an interface, you have to declare the interface before using it, all the attributes must be passed, and the types need to be set:  Using objects as direct inputs is sometimes common when passing to a function:  function greetingUser user: {name: string, lastName: string}  {     console.log `Hello, ${user.name} ${user.lastName}` ; }  And finally, they are used for declaring a type of object and reusing it:  interface IPerson {     name: string;     age: number; }  const person: IPerson = {     name: 'Heitor',     age: 31, };  type Person = {     name: string,     age: number, };  const person: Person = {     name: 'Heitor',     age: 31, };  console.log `My name is ${person.name}, I am ${person.age} years old` ;  Functions In TypeScript, one of the most difficult types to declare is a function. It can get very  complex in a just simple concatenation of the functional chain.  Declaring a function in TypeScript is a composition of the parameters that the function will receive and the final type that the function will return.  You can declare a simple function inside a constant, like this:  const sumOfValues:  a:number, b:number : number =  a: number, b: number : number => a + b;  [ 49 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  A more complex function declared inside a constant can be declared like this:  const complexFunction:  a: number  =>  b:number  => number =  a: number :  b: number  => number =>  b: number : number => a + b;  When declaring a function as a normal function, the way to type it is almost the same as in a constant way, but you don't need to declare that the functions are a function. Here is an example:  function foo a: number, b:number : number{     return a + b; }  Interfaces TypeScript checks that the values of variables are the correct type and the same principle is applied to classes, objects, or contracts between your code. This is commonly known as "duck typing" or "structural sub-typing". Interfaces exist to fill this space and define these contracts or types.  Let's try to understand an interface with this example:  function greetingStudent student: {name: string} {     console.log `Hello ${student.name}` ; }  const newStudent = {name: 'Heitor'};  greetingStudent newStudent ;  The function will know that the object has the property name on it and that it's valid to call it.  We can rewrite it with the interface type for better code management:  interface IStudent {     name: string;     course?: string;     readonly university: string; }  function greetingStudent student: IStudent {     console.log `Hello ${student.name}` ;     if student.course {         console.log `Welcome to the ${student.course}` semester` ;     }  [ 50 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  }  const newStudent: IStudent = { name: 'Heitor', university: 'UDF' };  greetingStudent newStudent ;  As you can see, we have a new property called course that has a ? declared on it. This symbolizes that this property can be nulled or undefined. It's called an optional property.  There is a property with a read-only attribute declared. If we try to change after it's declared on the variable creation, we will receive a compile error because it makes the property read-only.  Decorators A new feature was introduced in ECMAScript 6—classes. With the introduction of these, the usage of decorators was made possible on the JavaScript engine.   Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and meta-programming syntax to class declarations and its members. As it's in a final state of approval on the TC-39 committee  where TC stands for Technical Committee , the TypeScript compiler already has this available to be used.  To enable it, you can set the flags on the tsconfig.json file:  {     "compilerOptions": {         "target": "ES5",         "experimentalDecorators": true     } }  Decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class, method, accessor property, or parameter. They are used in the form of @expression, where the expression is a function that will be called at runtime.  An example of a decorator that can be applied to a class can be seen in the following code snippet:  function classSeal constructor: Function  {     Object.seal constructor ;     Object.seal constructor.prototype ; }  [ 51 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  When you create this function, you are saying that the object of the constructor and the prototype of it will be sealed.  To use it inside a class is very simple:  @classSeal class Animal {     sound: string;     constructor sound: string  {         this.sound = sound;     }     emitSound   {         return "The animal says, " + this.sound;     } }  These are just some examples of decorators and their powers to help you with the development of object-oriented programming  OOP  with TypeScript.  In conclusion In summary, types are just a way to make our life easier in the process of development with TypeScript and JavaScript.  Because JavaScript is a dynamic language and doesn't have a static type, all the types and interfaces declared in TypeScript are strictly used just by TypeScript. This helps the compiler catch errors, warnings, and the language server to help the integrated development environment  IDE  on the development process to analyze your code as it is being written.   This is a basic introduction to TypeScript, covering the basics of the typed language, and how to understand and use it. There is much more to learn about its use, such as generics, modules, namespaces, and so on.  With this introduction, you can understand how the new Vue 3 core works and how to use the basics of TypeScript in your project, and take advantage of the typed language on your project.  There is always more knowledge to find on TypeScript, as it is a growing "language" on top of JavaScript and has a growing community.  Don't forget to look at the TypeScript documentation to find out more about it and how it can improve your code from now on.

Creating your first TypeScript class In TypeScript, there is no main paradigm in which you write your program. You can choose between object-oriented, structural, or event functional.   In most cases, you will see an OOP paradigm being used. In this recipe, we will learn about creating a class inside TypeScript, its inheritance, the interface, and other properties that can be used inside the code.  Getting ready To start our project, we will need to create an npm project. To do this, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm init -y  You also need to install TypeScript. To do this, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install typescript --only=dev  [ 53 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem How to do it... When writing a class inside a TypeScript file, we first need to have in mind what this class will do, what this class can be for, how it can be extended by another class through inheritance, and how it can be affected in the process.  Chapter 2  Imagine that we have a basic Animal class. This class can have some basic properties such as its name, whether it produces a sound, its family, and the basic food chain this animal eats.  1.  Let's start with the basics of the process, the food chain. We need to make sure that it's an innumerable list, and that each file that is using it will have the same value at the end. We just need to call a constant variable:  2.  Now, we want to make the basic interface for our animal. We know that our animal has a name, can produce a sound, can be part of a family, and be in a food chain category. Using an interface in a class, we make a contract between the class and what will be exposed, helping in the development process:  export enum FoodChainType {     Carnivorous = 'carnivorous',     Herbivorous = 'herbivorous',     Omnivorous = 'omnivorous', }  interface IAnimal {     name: string;     sound?: string;     family: string;     foodChainType: FoodChainType; }  3.  With all that settled, we can make our Animal class. Each class can have its constructor. The class constructor can be simple, containing just some variables as arguments, or can be more complex and have an object as an argument. If your constructor will have any parameters, an interface or declaring the type of each parameter is needed. In this case, our constructor will be an object and will have only one parameter that is the same as the Animal, so it will extend the IAnimal interface:  interface IAnimalConstructor extends IAnimal { }  [ 54 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  4.  Now, to make our class, we have declared the interfaces and enums that will be used. We will start by declaring that the class will implement the IBasicAnimal interface. To do this, we need to add some public elements that our class will have and declare those too. We will need to implement the functions to show what animal it is and what sound it makes. Now, we have a basic class that includes all the attributes for our animal. It has separate interfaces for the class and the constructors. The enum for the food chain is declared in a human-readable way, so the JavaScript imports of this library can execute without any problems:  interface IBasicAnimal extends IAnimal {   whoAmI:    => void;   makeSound:    => void; }  export class Animal implements IBasicAnimal {   public name: string;   public sound: string;   public family: string;   public foodChainType: FoodChainType;    constructor params: IAnimalConstructor  {     this.name = params.name;     this.sound = params.sound  '';     this.family = params.family;     this.foodChainType = params.foodChainType;   }    public whoAmI  : void {     console.log `I am a ${this.name}, my family is ${this.family}.     My diet is ${this.foodChainType}.` ;     if  this.sound  {       console.log [...Array 2 .fill this.sound ].join ', '  ;     }   }    public makeSound  : void {     console.log this.sound ;   } }  [ 55 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  5.  Let's extend this class with a few lines of code and transform this Animal into a Dog:  import {Animal, FoodChainType} from '. Animal';  class Dog extends Animal {   constructor   {     super {       name: 'Dog',       sound: 'Wof!',       family: 'Canidae',       foodChainType: FoodChainType.Carnivorous,     } ;   }n }  This is a simple way of extending a parent class and using the parent's definition of the child to compose a new class with almost the same interface as the parent.  How it works... Classes in TypeScript work the same as other classes in languages such as Java or C. The compiler evaluates these common principles during development and compilation.  In this case, we made a simple class that had some public properties that were inherent by the children's classes. These variables were all readable and can be mutated.   There's more... In TypeScript, we have a wide range of possible uses for classes, such as abstract classes, special modifiers, and using classes as interfaces. We've just covered the basics of the classes here to give us a good starting knowledge base. If you want to go deeper, the TypeScript documentation is very helpful and has a lot of examples that can help in the process of learning.

Creating your first project with Vue CLI When the Vue team realized that developers were having problems creating and managing their applications, they saw an opportunity to create a tool that could help developers around the world. The Vue CLI project was born.  The Vue CLI tool is a CLI tool that is used in terminal commands, such as Windows PowerShell, Linux Bash, or macOS Terminal. It was created as a starting point for the development of Vue, where developers can start a project and manage and build it smoothly. The focus of the Vue CLI team when developing was to give developers the opportunity to have more time to think about the code and spend less time on the tooling needed to put their code into production, adding new plugins or a simple hot-module- reload.  The Vue CLI tool is tweaked in such a way that there is no need to eject your tooling code outside the CLI before putting it into production.  When version 3 was released, the Vue UI project was added to the CLI as the main function, transforming the CLI commands into a more complete visual solution with lots of new additions and improvements.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 57 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem How to do it...

Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys    default  babel, eslint  ❯ Manually select features ‌  3.  4.  There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method is a basic babel and eslint project without any plugin or configuration, and the Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins, linters, and options. We will go for Manually.‌ Now, we are asked about the features that we will want on the project. Those features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Router  Vue-Router , testers, linters, and more:  ?

After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  9.  After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to store them is on a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store then on the package.json file:  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  [ 59 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  10.  Now, you can choose if you want to make this selection a preset for future projects so that you don't need to reselect everything again:  ? Save this as a preset for future projects?  y N  n  11.  The CLI will automatically create the folder with the name you set in the first step, install everything, and configure the project.  You are now able to navigate and run the project. The basic commands on Vue CLI projects are as follows:  npm run serve—For running a development server locally npm run build—For building and minifying the application for deployment npm run lint—To execute the lint on the code  You can execute those commands via the Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows .  There's more... The CLI has a tool inside it called Vue UI that helps in the process of managing your Vue projects. This tool will take care of the project dependencies, plugins, and configurations.  Each npm script in the Vue UI tool is named as Tasks, and on those tasks, you can get real- time statistics such as—for example—the size of the assets, modules, and dependencies; numbers of errors or warnings; and more deep networking data for fine-tuning your application.  To enter the Vue UI interface, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue ui  See also Find more information about the Vue CLI project at https: ​ ​cli.​vuejs.​org ​guide ​.

If you check your code, you will see that the main.js file was changed, and the vuex  store  and vue-router  router  plugins are now imported and injected to the Vue instance:  [ 64 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem How it works... The Vue UI plugins work in conjunction with npm or yarn to automatically install the packages on your project, and then inject—when possible—the necessary conditions on the Vue instance.  Chapter 2  If a plugin is a visual, directive, or a non-direct instantiated plugin, the Vue UI will install it and manage it, but you need to import it for use on your application.  Adding TypeScript to a Vue CLI project Using TypeScript in a JavaScript project, even for static type checking, is good practice. It helps minimize the chance of errors and Object problems inside your project.  Adding TypeScript to a Vue project with the help of the Vue UI is very simple, and you will be able to use JavaScript code with TypeScript.

Creating your first TypeScript Vue component with vue-class-component As Vue components are object-based and have a strong relationship with the this keyword of the JavaScript object, it gets a little bit confusing to develop a TypeScript component.  The vue-class-component plugin uses the ECMAScript decorators proposal to pass the statically typed values directly to the Vue component and makes the process of the compiler understand what is happening more easily.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 68 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem How to do it...

Chapter 2  Follow the instructions to create your first Vue component with Typescript and vue- class-component:  1. 2.  Create a new file inside the src components folder, called Counter.vue. Now, let's start making the script part of the Vue component. We will make a class that will have data with a number, two methods—one for increasing and another for decreasing—and, finally, a computed property to format the final data:    import Vue from 'vue'; import Component from 'vue-class-component';  @Component export default class Counter extends Vue {   valueNumber: number = 0;    get formattedNumber   {     return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;   }    increase   {     this.valueNumber += 1;   }    decrease   {     this.valueNumber -= 1;   } }    3.  It's time to create the template and rendering for this component. The process is the same as a JavaScript Vue file. We will add the buttons for increasing and decreasing the value and showing the formatted text:                     {{ formattedNumber }}           Increase   [ 69 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2           Decrease               4.  In the App.vue file, we need to import the component we just created:                       import { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator'; import Counter from '. components Counter.vue';  @Component {   components: {     Counter,   }, }  export default class App extends Vue {  }       app     font-family 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif     -webkit-font-smoothing antialiased     -moz-osx-font-smoothing grayscale     text-align center     color 2c3e50     margin-top 60px    5.  Now, when you run the npm run serve command on Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows , you will see your component running and executing on screen:  [ 70 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem How it works... The vue-class-component plugin makes use of the new proposal of decorators to inject and pass some attributes to the classes on TypeScript.  Chapter 2  This injection helps in the process of simplifying the development of a component with a syntax more aligned with TypeScript than with the Vue common object.

Creating a custom mixin with vue-class- component In Vue, a mixin is a way to reuse the same code in other Vue objects, like mixing all the property of the mixin inside the component.  When using a mixin, Vue first declares the mixin property and then the component values, so the components will be always the last and valid values. This merge occurs in a deep mode and has a specific way already declared inside the framework, but it can be changed by a special config.  With the use of mixins, developers can write tiny pieces of code and reuse them in lots of components.  This approach simplifies your work and allows you to complete tasks quicker.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  [ 71 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. We can use the one we created in the last recipe or start a new one. To find how to create a Vue CLI project with TypeScript, please check the 'Creating your first TypeScript Vue component with vue-class-component' recipe.  In this recipe, we will split it into two separate parts. First, we will create the counter component, and then we will use the code that is shared to create the mixin.  Creating the Counter component Now, follow the instructions to create a custom mixin with vue-class-component:  1.  2.  We need to make a new component called CounterByTen.vue in the src components folder. Now, let's start making the script part of the Vue component. We will make a class that will have a variable with the type of a number and a default value of 0; two methods, one for increasing by 10 and another for decreasing by 10; and, finally, a computed property to format the final data:    import Vue from 'vue'; import Component from 'vue-class-component';  @Component export default class CounterByTen extends Vue {   valueNumber: number = 0;    get formattedNumber   {     return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;   }    increase   {     this.valueNumber += 10;   }    decrease   {  [ 72 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2      this.valueNumber -= 10;   } }    3.  It's time to create the template and rendering for this component. The process is the same as for a JavaScript Vue file. We will add the buttons for increasing and decreasing the value and for showing the formatted text:                     {{ this.formattedNumber }}           Increase By Ten           Decrease By Ten               4.  In the App.vue file, we need to import the component we just created:                                   import { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator'; import Counter from '. components Counter.vue'; import CounterByTen from '. components CounterByTen.vue';  @Component {   components: {     Counter,     CounterByTen,   }, }  export default class App extends Vue {  }       app     font-family 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif     -webkit-font-smoothing antialiased  [ 73 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2      -moz-osx-font-smoothing grayscale     text-align center     color 2c3e50     margin-top 60px    Extracting similar code for the mixin With both of the components having similar code, we can extract this similar code and create a mixin. This mixin can be imported in both of the components and their behavior will be the same:  1. 2.  Create a file called defaultNumber.ts in the src mixins folder. To code our mixin, we will import the Component and Vue decorators from the vue-class-component plugin, to be the base of the mixin. We will need to take a similar code and place it inside the mixin:  import Vue from 'vue'; import Component from 'vue-class-component';  @Component export default class DefaultNumber extends Vue {   valueNumber: number = 0;    get formattedNumber   {     return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;   } }  3.  With the mixin ready, open the Counter.vue component on the src components folder and import it. To do this, we need to import a special export from the vue-class-component called mixins and extend it with the mixin we want to extend. This will remove the Vue and Component decorators because they are already declared on the mixin:                     {{ this.formattedNumber }}         Increase By Ten         Decrease By Ten               [ 74 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2    import Vue from 'vue'; import Component, { mixins } from 'vue-class-component'; import DefaultNumber from '.. mixins defaultNumber';  @Component export default class CounterByTen extends mixins DefaultNumber  {   increase   {     this.valueNumber += 10;   }    decrease   {     this.valueNumber -= 10;   } }    4.  Now, when you run the npm run serve command on Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows , you will see your component running and executing on screen:  How it works... The process of using mixins with TypeScript is the same as with the Vue objects. The code that is shared can be split into smaller files and called in the components for easier coding.  When using TypeScript and vue-class-component, the Vue and Component decorators need to be declared on the mixins because the class that will be using the mixin will already have this extension, as it extends this mixin.  We took the same piece of code that works the same on both the components and placed it in a new file that is then called in both of the components.

Chapter 2  Find more about Vue mixins at https: ​ ​v3.​vuejs.​org ​guide ​mixins.​html  Creating a custom function decorator with vue-class-component Decorators were introduced in ECMAScript 2015. A decorator is a kind of high-order function that wraps a function with another function. This brings a lot of new improvements to the code—along with greater productivity—because it takes the principle of functional programming and simplifies it.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. To find how to create a Vue CLI project, please check the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe. We can use the one we created in the last recipe or start a new one.  [ 76 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  Follow these steps to create your custom function decorator with vue-class-component:  1. 2.  Create a file called componentMount.js inside the src decorators folder. We need to import the createDecorator function from the vue-class- component to be able to use it on a vue-class-component based component, and to start coding our decorator:  import { createDecorator } from 'vue-class-component'; import componentMountLogger from '. componentLogger';  export default createDecorator  options  => {   options.mixins = [...options.mixins, componentMountLogger]; } ;  A createDecorator function is like an extension of the Vue vm  View- Model , so it won't have the property of an ECMAScript decorator but will function as a Vue decorator.  3.  We need to use the componentLogger.js file in our decorator. This function will take all the data values that are set in the "decorated" component and  add a watcher to it. This watcher will log the new and old values whenever it changes. This function will only be executed with a debug data set to true:  export default {   mounted   {     if  this.debug  {       const componentName = this.name  '';       console.log `The ${componentName} was mounted                                        successfully.` ;        const dataKeys = Object.keys this.$data ;        if  dataKeys.length  {         console.log 'The base data are:' ;         console.table dataKeys ;          dataKeys.forEach  key  => {           this.$watch key,  newValue, oldValue  => {             console.log `The new value for ${key} is:                             ${newValue}` ;             console.log `The old value for ${key} is:                             ${oldValue}` ;           }, {             deep: true,           } ;  [ 77 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2          } ;       }     }   }, };  4.  Now, we need to import the decorator to our Counter.vue component file located in the src components folder and add the debugger data to it:                     {{ this.formattedNumber }}         Increase         Decrease                 import Vue from 'vue'; import Component from 'vue-class-component'; import componentMount from '.. decorators componentMount';  @Component @componentMount export default class Counter extends Vue {   valueNumber: number = 0;    debug: boolean = true;    get formattedNumber   {     return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;   }    increase   {     this.valueNumber += 1;   }    decrease   {     this.valueNumber -= 1;   } }    [ 78 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem How it works... The createDecorator function is a factory function that extends the Vue vm  View Model , which produces an extension of the Vue component, such as a Vue mixin. A Vue mixin is a property of the Vue component that can be used to share and reuse code between components.  Chapter 2  When we call the mixin, it takes the current component as an option of the first argument  the key if it was attached to a property , and the index of it.  We added a dynamic debugger that is only attached when debug data exists and is set to true. This debugger will log the current data and set watchers for the changes in the data, showing the logs on the console each time the data is changed.  There's more... When using linters, some rules can be a problem with decorators. So, it's wise to disable them only on the files that are having problems with the rules that are required for the code to work.  In an AirBnB style, for example, the no-param-reassign rule is required because the decorator uses the option as a reference to pass the value.

Adding custom hooks to vue-class- component On Vue, it's possible to add hooks to its life cycle through the Plugins application programming interface  API . The most basic example is the vue-router with the navigation guards, such as the beforeRouterEnter and beforeRouterLeave functions hooks.  [ 79 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  The hooks, as the name implies, are little functions that are called each time something will happen.  You can take advantage of the hooks and make them more powerful, adding new functionalities to your components, such as checking for special security access, adding meta search engine optimization  SEO , or even pre-fetching data.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. We can use the one we created in the last recipe or start a new one. To find how to create a Vue CLI project with TypeScript, please check the 'Adding TypeScript to a Vue CLI project' recipe.  Now, follow these steps to add custom hooks to your Vue project using TypeScript and vue-class-component:  1.  We need to add vue-router to the project. This can be done with the Vue CLI project creation or in the Vue UI interface after the project has been created.  If prompted about the mode, the vue-router should run. Take note that selecting the History option will require special server configuration when it's time to deploy.  2.  Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the npm run serve command, and you will see that the vue- router is working and that there are two working routers: home and about.  [ 80 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  3.  Let's start creating and naming our hooks to register on the main application. To do this, we need to create a vue-router.js file inside the src classComponentsHooks folder:  import Component from 'vue-class-component';  Component.registerHooks [   'beforeRouteEnter',   'beforeRouteLeave', ] ;  4.  We need to import this file to the main.ts file as it needs to be called before the application final build:  import '. classComponentsHooks vue-router';  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import router from '. router';  Vue.config.productionTip = false;  new Vue {  router,  render: h => h App , } .$mount 'app' ;  5.  6.  We now have the hooks registered on the vue-class-component and they can be used inside the TypeScript components.  We need to create a new router location called Secure.vue in the src views folder. The secure page will have a password to enter, vuejs. When the user enters this password, the router guard will grant permission, and the user can see the page. If the password is wrong, the user will be taken back to the home page. When they leave the page, an alert will show a message to the user:             This is an secure page           import { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator'; import { Route, RawLocation } from 'vue-router';  [ 81 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  type RouteNext =  to?: RawLocation  false    vm: Vue  => any      void  => void;  @Component export default class Home extends Vue {   beforeRouteEnter to: Route, from: Route, next: RouteNext  {     const securePassword = 'vuejs';      const userPassword = prompt 'What is the password?' ;      if  userPassword === securePassword  {       next  ;     } else if  !userPassword  {       next ' ' ;     }   }    beforeRouteLeave to: Route, from: Route, next: RouteNext  {     alert 'Bye!' ;     next  ;   } }    7.  Now with our page done, we need to add it to the router.ts file to be able to call it in the Vue application:   import Vue from 'vue'; import Router from 'vue-router'; import Home from '. views Home.vue';  Vue.use Router ;  export default new Router {   routes: [     {       path: ' ',       name: 'home',       component: Home,     },     {       path: ' about',       name: 'about',       component:    => import '. views About.vue' ,     },     {       path: ' secure',       name: 'secure',  [ 82 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2        component:    => import '. views Secure.vue' ,     },   ], } ;  8.  With the route added and the view created, the final step is to add the link to the main App.vue file, and we will have a component with an integrated hook on it:                     Home          About          Secure                      app   font-family 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif   -webkit-font-smoothing antialiased   -moz-osx-font-smoothing grayscale    text-align center    color 2c3e50  nav   padding 30px   a     font-weight bold     color 2c3e50     &.router-link-exact-active       color 42b983    How it works... The class component needs to understand what are the navigation guards that are being added to the Vue prototype before executing the Vue application. Because of this, we needed to import the custom hooks on the first line of the main.ts file.  In the component, with the hooks registered, it's possible to add them as methods because the vue-class-component has made all those custom imports into base methods for the component decorator.  [ 83 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  We used two of the vue-router navigation guards' hooks. Those hooks are called each time a route will enter or leave. The first two parameters we didn't use, the to and from parameters, are the ones that carry information about the future route and the past route.  The next function is always required because it executes a route change. If no argument is passed in the function, the route will continue with the one that was called, but if you want to change the route on the fly, it is possible to pass an argument to change where the user will go.

Adding vue-property-decorator to vue-class- component Some of the most important parts of Vue are missing in the vue-class-component in the form of TypeScript decorators. So, the community made a library called vue-property- decorator that is fully endorsed by the Vue core team.  This library brings some of the missing parts as ECMAScript proposal decorators, such as props, watch, model, inject, and so on.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  [ 84 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. We can use the one we created in the last recipe or start a new one. To find how to create a Vue CLI project with TypeScript, please check the 'Creating a custom mixin with vue-class-component' recipe.  Follow these steps to add vue-property-decorator to a Vue class-based component:  1.  We need to add the vue-property-decorator to our project. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -S vue-property-decorator  2.  In the components mixin, we will add a decorator for receiving a prop, which will be a value for our number that is calculated:  import {   Vue,   Component,   Prop, } from 'vue-property-decorator';  @Component export default class DefaultNumber extends Vue {   valueNumber: number = 0;    @Prop Number  readonly value: number  undefined;    get formattedNumber   {     return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;   } }  [ 85 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  3.  With that number, we need to make the watchers emit the event to the parent component when the value changes, and update the value inside when the value is changed within the parent component. To do this, we need to create a new file called numberWatcher.ts inside the src mixins folder:   import {   Watch,   Mixins, } from 'vue-property-decorator'; import DefaultNumber from '. defaultNumber';  export default class NumberWatchers extends Mixins DefaultNumber  {   @Watch 'valueNumber'    onValueNumberChanged val: number  {     this.$emit 'input', val ;   }    @Watch 'value', { immediate: true }    onValueChanged val: number  {     this.valueNumber = val;   } }  In Vue, the v-model directive works like a sugar syntax, as a combination of the Vue $emit function and the Vue props function. When the value is changed, the component needs to $emit with the 'input' name, and the component needs to have in the props function a value key, which will be the value that will be passed down from the parent component to the child component.  4.  With our mixin updated, our components need to be updated too. First, we will update the Counter.vue component, changing the imported mixin from the defaultNumber.ts file to numberWatcher.ts:                     {{ this.formattedNumber }}         Increase         Decrease               [ 86 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2    import Vue from 'vue'; import Component, { mixins } from 'vue-class-component'; import NumberWatcher from '.. mixins numberWatcher';  @Component export default class Counter extends mixins NumberWatcher  {   increase   {     this.valueNumber += 1;   }    decrease   {     this.valueNumber -= 1;   } }    5.  Now, we will update the CounterByTen.vue component, and add the newly created mixin:                     {{ this.formattedNumber }}         Increase By Ten         Decrease By Ten                 import Vue from 'vue'; import Component, { mixins } from 'vue-class-component'; import NumberWatcher from '.. mixins numberWatcher';  @Component export default class CounterByTen extends mixins NumberWatcher  {   increase   {     this.valueNumber += 10;   }    decrease   {     this.valueNumber -= 10;   } }    [ 87 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem  Chapter 2  6.  With everything settled, we just need to update the App.vue component. This time, we will store a variable in the component that will be passed down to both of the child components, and when the components emit the update events, this variable will change automatically, updating the other components too:            <Counter       v-model="amount"      >           <CounterByTen       v-model="amount"      >          import { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator'; import Counter from '. components Counter.vue'; import CounterByTen from '. components CounterByTen.vue';  @Component {   components: {     Counter,     CounterByTen,   }, }  export default class App extends Vue {   amount: number = 0; }       app     font-family 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif     -webkit-font-smoothing antialiased     -moz-osx-font-smoothing grayscale     text-align center     color 2c3e50     margin-top 60px    [ 88 ]   Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem How it works... By injecting the decorators at the vue-class-components, the vue-property- decorator helps the TypeScript compiler check for the types and static analysis of your Vue code.  Chapter 2  We used two of the decorators available, the @Watch and @Prop decorators.  As we took apart the common parts of our code in the form of mixins, the process implementation became easier.  The parent component passed down a property to the child component, passing the initial value and the subsequently updated value.  This value is checked and updated inside the child component, which is used to update a local variable used by the calculation functions. When the calculation is done and the value is changed, the watcher emits an event that is passed to the parent component, which updates the main variable, and the loop goes on.  There's more... There is another library that works the same as the vue-property-decorator, but for the vuex plugin, called vuex-class.  This library uses the same process as vue-property-decorator. It creates an inject decorator in the component. Those decorators help the TypeScript compiler to check for types in the development process.

In Vue, we have the power to choose how we can gather this data, manipulate it as we want, and deliver it to the server.  In this chapter, we will learn more about the process of data manipulation and data handling, form validations, data filtering, how to display this data to the user, and how to present it in a way that is different from what we then have inside our application.  We will learn how to use the vue-devtools to go deep inside the Vue components and see what is happening to our data and application.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Creating the "hello world" component Creating an input form with two-way data binding Adding an event listener to an element Removing the v-model from the input Creating a dynamic to-do list Creating computed properties and exploring how they work Displaying cleaner data and text with custom filters Adding form validation with Vuelidate Creating filters and sorters for a list Creating conditional filtering to sort list data Adding custom styles and transitions Using vue-devtools to debug your application   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue CLI.  Attention, Windows users—you need to install an npm package called windows-build-tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do this, open PowerShell as administrator and execute the following command:  > npm install -g windows-build-tools.  To install Vue CLI, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  Creating the "hello world" component A Vue application is a combination of various components, bound together and orchestrated by the Vue framework. Knowing how to make your component is important. Each component is like a brick in the wall and needs to be made in a way that, when placed, doesn't end up needing other bricks to be reshaped in different ways around it. We are going to learn how to make a base component, with some important principles that focus on organization and clean code.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 91 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or start a new one.   Chapter 3  To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create my-component  The command-line interface  CLI  will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue, and the spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys  ❯ default  babel, eslint    Manually select features ‌  Let's create our first "hello world" component, following these steps:  1.  2.  Let's create a new file called CurrentTime.vue file in the src components folder. On this file, we will start with the   part of our component. It will be a shadowed-box card that will display the current date formatted:                     Today is:         {{ getCurrentDate }}               3.  Now, we need to create the   part. We will start with the name property. This will be used when debugging our application with vue-devtools to identify our component and helps the integrated development environment  IDE  too. For the getCurrentDate computed property, we will create a computed property that will return the current date, formatted by the Intl browser function:    export default {   name: 'CurrentTime',  [ 92 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3    computed: {     getCurrentDate   {       const browserLocale =         navigator.languages && navigator.languages.length           ? navigator.languages[0]           : navigator.language;       const intlDateTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat          browserLocale,         {           year: 'numeric',           month: 'numeric',           day: 'numeric',           hour: 'numeric',           minute: 'numeric'         } ;        return intlDateTime.format new Date   ;     }   } };    4.  For styling our box, we need to create a style.css file in the src folder, then add the cardBox style to it:  .cardBox {   box-shadow: 0 5px 10px 0 rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ;   transition: 0.3s linear;   max-width: 33%;   border-radius: 3px;   margin: 20px; }  .cardBox:hover {   box-shadow: 0 10px 20px 0 rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ; }  .cardBox>.container {   padding: 4px 18px; }  [class*='col-'] {   display: inline-block; }  @media only screen and  max-width: 600px  {   [class*='col-'] {     width: 100%;  [ 93 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3    }    .cardBox {     margin: 20px 0;   } }  @media only screen and  min-width: 600px  {   .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}   .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}   .col-3 {width: 25%;}   .col-4 {width: 33.33%;}   .col-5 {width: 41.66%;}   .col-6 {width: 50%;}   .col-7 {width: 58.33%;}   .col-8 {width: 66.66%;}   .col-9 {width: 75%;}   .col-10 {width: 83.33%;}   .col-11 {width: 91.66%;}   .col-12 {width: 100%;} }  @media only screen and  min-width: 768px  {   .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}   .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}   .col-3 {width: 25%;}   .col-4 {width: 33.33%;}   .col-5 {width: 41.66%;}   .col-6 {width: 50%;}   .col-7 {width: 58.33%;}   .col-8 {width: 66.66%;}   .col-9 {width: 75%;}   .col-10 {width: 83.33%;}   .col-11 {width: 91.66%;}   .col-12 {width: 100%;} }  @media only screen and  min-width: 992px  {   .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}   .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}   .col-3 {width: 25%;}   .col-4 {width: 33.33%;}   .col-5 {width: 41.66%;}   .col-6 {width: 50%;}   .col-7 {width: 58.33%;}   .col-8 {width: 66.66%;}   .col-9 {width: 75%;}   .col-10 {width: 83.33%;}  [ 94 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3    .col-11 {width: 91.66%;}   .col-12 {width: 100%;} }  @media only screen and  min-width: 1200px  {   .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}   .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}   .col-3 {width: 25%;}   .col-4 {width: 33.33%;}   .col-5 {width: 41.66%;}   .col-6 {width: 50%;}   .col-7 {width: 58.33%;}   .col-8 {width: 66.66%;}   .col-9 {width: 75%;}   .col-10 {width: 83.33%;}   .col-11 {width: 91.66%;}   .col-12 {width: 100%;} }  5.  In the App.vue file, we need to import our component to be able to see it:    import CurrentTime from '. components CurrentTime.vue';                     export default {   name: 'app',   components: {     CurrentTime   } }    import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '.

The Vue component works almost like the Node.js packages. To use it in your code, you need to import the component and then declare it inside the components property on the component you want to use.  Like a wall of bricks, a Vue application is made of components that call and use other components.  For our component, we used the Intl.DateTimeFormat function, a native function, which can be used to format and parse dates to declared locations. To get the local format, we used the navigator global variable.

In Vue, it's possible to use a two- way data binding method, where the value of the input on the Document Object Model  DOM  is passed to the JavaScript—or vice versa.  This makes the web form more dynamic, giving you the possibility to manage, format, and validate the data before saving or sending the data back to the server.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating the "hello world" component' recipe.   Now, let's follow these steps to create an input form with a two-way data binding:  1. 2.  Let's create a new file called TaskInput.vue in the src components folder. In this file, we're going to create a component that will have a text input and a display text. This text will be based on what is typed on the text input. At the   part of the component, we need to create an HTML input and a mustache variable that will receive and render the data:                     My task is: {{ task }}   [ 97 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  3.  Now, on the   part of the component, we will name it and add the task to the data property. As the data always needs to be a returned Object, we will use an arrow function to return an Object directly:        <input         type='text'         v-model='task'         class='taskInput'  >                export default {   name: 'TaskInput',   data:    =>  {     task: '',   } , };    4.  We need to add some style to this component. In the   part of the component, we need to add the scoped attribute so that the style remains only bound to the component and won't mix with other Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  rules:      .tasker{     margin: 20px;   }   .tasker .taskInput {     font-size: 14px;     margin: 0 10px;     border: 0;     border-bottom: 1px solid rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.75 ;   }   .tasker button {     border: 1px solid rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.75 ;     border-radius: 3px;     box-shadow: 0 1px 2px 0 rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ;   }    [ 98 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  5.  Now, we need to import this component into our App.vue file:                             import CurrentTime from '. components CurrentTime.vue'; import TaskInput from '. components TaskInput';  export default {   name: 'app',   components: {     CurrentTime,     TaskInput,   } }    6.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... When you create an HTML input element and add a v-model to it, you are passing a directive, built into Vue, that checks the input type and gives us sugar syntax for the input. This handles the update of the value of the variable and the DOM.  [ 99 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  This model is what is called two-way data binding. If the variable is changed by the code, the DOM will re-render, and if it's changed by the DOM via user input, such as the input- form, the JavaScript code can then execute a function.  See also Find more information about the form input bindings at https: ​ ​v3.​vuejs.​org ​guide  forms.​html  Adding an event listener to an element The most common method of parent-child communication in Vue is through props and events. In JavaScript, it's common to add event listeners to elements of the DOM tree to execute functions on specific events. In Vue, it's possible to add listeners and name them as you wish, rather than sticking to the names that exist on the JavaScript engine.  In this recipe, we are going to learn how to create custom events and how to emit then.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating an input form with two-way data binding' recipe.  [ 100 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Follow these steps to add an event listener in an element on Vue:  1. 2.  Create a new component or open the TaskInput.vue file. At the   part, we are going to add a button element and add an event listener to the button click event with the v-on directive. We will remove the {{ task }} variable from the component, as from now on it will be emitted and won't be displayed on the component anymore:  3.  On the   part of the component, we need to add a method to handle the click event. This method will be named addTask. The method will emit an event called add-task and send the task on the data. After that, the task on the component will be reset:                     My task is:        <input         type='text'         v-model='task'         class='taskInput'  >       <button         v-on:click='addTask'>             Add Task                        export default {   name: 'TaskInput',   data:    =>  {     task: '',   } ,   methods: {     addTask  {       this.$emit 'add-task', this.task ;       this.task = '';     },   } };    [ 101 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  4.  On the App.vue file, we need to add an event listener bind on the component. This listener will be attached to the add-task event. We will use the shortened version of the v-on directive, @. When it's fired, the event will call the method, addNewTask, which will send an alert that a new task was added:  5.  Now, let's create the addNewTask method. This will receive the task as a parameter and will show an alert to the user, displaying that the task was added:    import CurrentTime from '. components CurrentTime.vue'; import TaskInput from '. components TaskInput';                  <task-input       class='col-6'       @add-task='addNewTask'      >        export default {   name: 'app',   components: {     CurrentTime,     TaskInput,   },   methods:{     addNewTask task {       alert `New task added: ${task}` ;     },   }, }    6.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  [ 102 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... The HTML events are read by Vue with the v-on event handling directive. When we attached the v-on:click directive to the button, we added a listener to the button so that a function will be executed when the user clicks on it.  The function is declared on the component methods. That function, when called, will emit an event, denoting that any component using this component as a child can listen to it with the v-on directive.

What if I told you that the rabbit hole can go deep enough that you can control everything that can happen with the events and values of the inputs?  We will learn how to extract the sugar syntax of the v-model directive and transform it into the base syntax behind it.  [ 103 ]   Chapter 3  Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Adding an event listener to an element' recipe.  In the following steps, we will remove the v-model directive sugar syntax from the input:  1. 2.  Open the TaskInput.vue file. At the   block of the component, find the v-model directive. We'll remove the v-model directive. Then, we need to add a new bind to the input called v-bind:value or the shortened version, :value, and an event listener to the HTML input element. We need to add an event listener to the input event with the v-on:input directive or the shortened version, @input. The input bind will receive the task value as a parameter and the event listener will receive a value attribution, where it will make the task variable equal the value of the event value:                     My task is:        <input         type='text'         :value='task'         @input='task = $event.target.value'         class='taskInput'        >                 Add Task          [ 104 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3               > npm run serve  3.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  How it works... As a sugar syntax, the v-model directive does the magic of automatically declaring the bind and the event listener to the element for you, but the side effect is that you don't have full control over what can be achieved.  As we've seen, the bound value can be a variable, a method, a computed property, or a Vuex getter, for example. And for the event listener, it can be a function or a direct declaration of a variable assignment. When an event is emitted and passed to Vue, the $event variable is used to pass the event. In this case, as in normal JavaScript, to catch the value of an input, we need to use the event.target.value value.

Doing this allows us to learn more about the language process around the manipulation of states and data.  [ 105 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  We are going to make our to-do list using Vue. We'll use what we have learned and created in the previous recipes.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... There are some basic principles involved in making a to-do application—it must have a list of tasks; those tasks can be marked as done and undone, and the list can be filtered and sorted. Now, we are going to learn how to take the tasks and add them to the task list.  To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Removing the v-model from the input' recipe.  Now, follow these steps to create a dynamic to-do list with Vue and the previous recipes:  1.  In the App.vue file, we will create our array of tasks. This task will be filled every time the TaskInput.vue component emits a message. We will add an object to this array with the task, and the current date when the task was created. The date when the task was finished will be undefined for now. To do this, in the   part of the component, we need to create a method that receives a task and add this task with the current date to the taskList array:    import CurrentTime from '. components CurrentTime.vue'; import TaskInput from '. components TaskInput';  export default {   name: 'TodoApp',   components: {  [ 106 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3      CurrentTime,     TaskInput,   },   data:    =>  {     taskList: [],   } ,   methods:{     addNewTask task {       this.taskList.push {         task,         createdAt: Date.now  ,         finishedAt: undefined,       }      },   }, }    2.  Now, we need to render this list on the   part. We will iterate the list of tasks using the v-for directive of Vue. This directive, when we use it with an array, gives us access to two properties—the item itself and the index of the item. We will use the item to render it and the index to make the key of the element for the rendering. We need to add a checkbox that, when marked, calls a function that changes the status of the task and the display when the task was done:                                                       My Tasks                          <li               v-for=' taskItem, index  in taskList'               :key='`${index}_${Math.random  }`'             >               <input type='checkbox'                 :checked='!!taskItem.finishedAt'                 @input='changeStatus index '                >               {{ taskItem.task }}                                 {{ taskItem.finishedAt }}                                [ 107 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3                                             It's always important to remember that the key in the iterator needs to be unique. This is needed because the render function needs to knows which elements were changed. In the example, we added the Math.random   function to the index to generate a unique key, because the index of the first elements of the array is always the same number when the number of elements is reduced.  3.  We need to create the changeStatus function on the methods property of the App.vue. This function will receive the index of the task as a parameter, then go to the array of tasks and change the finishedAt property, which is our marker for when a task is done:  changeStatus taskIndex {   const task = this.taskList[taskIndex];     if task.finishedAt {       task.finishedAt = undefined;     } else {       task.finishedAt = Date.now  ;     } }  4.  Now, we need to add the task text to the left-hand side of the screen. On the   part of the component, we will make it scoped and add the custom class:      .taskList li{     text-align: left;   }    5.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  [ 108 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... As we received the emitted message from the component, we hydrated the message with more data and pushed it to a local array variable.  In the template we iterate this array, making it a list of tasks. This displays the tasks we need to do, the checkbox to mark when the task is done, and the time that a task was done.   When the user clicks on the checkbox, it executes a function, which marks the current task as done. If the task is already done, the function will set the finishedAt property as undefined.

[ 109 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Creating computed properties and understanding how they work Imagine that every time you have to fetch manipulated data, you need to execute a function. Imagine you need to get specific data that needs to go through some process and you need to execute it through a function every time. This type of work would not be easy to maintain. Computed properties exist to solve these problems. Using computed properties makes it easier to obtain data that needs preprocessing or even caching without executing any other external memorizing function.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.  Now, follow these steps to create a computed property and understand how it works:  1.  On the App.vue file, at the   part, we will add a new property between data and method, called computed. This is where the computed properties will be placed. We will create a new computed property called displayList, which will be the one that will be used to render the final list on the template:    import CurrentTime from '. components CurrentTime.vue'; import TaskInput from '. components TaskInput';  export default {  [ 110 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3    name: 'TodoApp',   components: {     CurrentTime,     TaskInput   },   data:    =>  {     taskList: []   } ,   computed: {     displayList  {       return this.taskList;     },   },   methods: {     addNewTask task  {       this.taskList.push {         task,         createdAt: Date.now  ,         finishedAt: undefined       } ;     },     changeStatus taskIndex {       const task = this.taskList[taskIndex];       if task.finishedAt {         task.finishedAt = undefined;       } else {         task.finishedAt = Date.now  ;       }     }   } };    The displayList property, for now, is just returning a cached value of the variable, and not the direct variable as itself.  2.  Now, on the   part, we need to change where the list is being fetched:                                                       My Tasks                          <li  [ 111 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3                v-for=' taskItem, index  in displayList'               :key='`${index}_${Math.random  }`'             >               <input type='checkbox'                 :checked='!!taskItem.finishedAt'                 @input='changeStatus index '                >               {{ taskItem.task }}                                 {{ taskItem.finishedAt }}                                                                          3.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  How it works... When using the computed property to pass a value to the template, this value is now cached. This means we will only trigger the rendering process when the value is updated. At the same time, we made sure that the template doesn't use the variable for rendering so that it can't be changed on the template, as it is a cached copy of the variable.  Using this process, we get the best performance because we won't waste processing time re- rendering the DOM tree for changes that have no effect on the data being displayed. This is because if something changes and the result is the same, the computed property caches the  result and won't update the final result.

How can we solve this problem? When rendering the data in Vue, it's possible to use what we call filters.  Imagine a series of pipes through which data flows. Data enters each pipe in one shape and exits in another. This is what filters in Vue look like. You can place a series of filters on the same variable, so it gets formatted, reshaped, and ultimately displayed with different data while the code remains the same. The code of the initial variable is immutable in those pipes.   Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.  [ 113 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Follow these steps to create your first custom Vue filter:  1.  In the App.vue file, at the   part, in the methods, create a formatDate function inside this property. This function will receive value as a parameter and enters the filter pipe. We can check if the value is a number because we know that our time is based on the Unix timestamp format. If it's a number, we will format based on the current browser location and return that formatted value. If the passed value is not a number, we just return the passed value:      import CurrentTime from '. components CurrentTime.vue';   import TaskInput from '. components TaskInput';    export default {     name: 'TodoApp',     components: {       CurrentTime,       TaskInput     },     data:    =>  {       taskList: []     } ,     computed: {       displayList   {         return this.taskList;       }     },     methods: {       formatDate value  {         if  !value  return '';         if  typeof value !== 'number'  return value;          const browserLocale =           navigator.languages && navigator.languages.length             ? navigator.languages[0]             : navigator.language;         const intlDateTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat            browserLocale,           {             year: 'numeric',             month: 'numeric',             day: 'numeric',             hour: 'numeric',             minute: 'numeric'           } ;          return intlDateTime.format new Date value  ;  [ 114 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3        },       addNewTask task  {         this.taskList.push {           task,           createdAt: Date.now  ,           finishedAt: undefined         } ;       },       changeStatus taskIndex  {         const task = this.taskList[taskIndex];         if  task.finishedAt  {           task.finishedAt = undefined;         } else {           task.finishedAt = Date.now  ;         }       }     }   };    2.  On the   part of the component, we need to pass the variable to the filter method. To do that, we need to find the taskItem.finishedAt property and make it the parameter of the formatDate method. We will add some text to denote that the task was Done at: at the beginning of the date:                                                       My Tasks                          <li               v-for=' taskItem, index  in displayList'               :key='`${index}_${Math.random  }`'             >               <input type='checkbox'                 :checked='!!taskItem.finishedAt'                 @input='changeStatus index '                >               {{ taskItem.task }}                                  Done at:                 {{ formatDate taskItem.finishedAt  }}                  [ 115 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3                                                           3.

Filters are methods that receive a value and must return a value to be displayed on the   section of the file, or used in a Vue property.  When we pass the value to the formatDate method, we know that it's a valid Unix timestamp, so it was possible to invoke to a new Date class constructor, passing the value as a parameter because the Unix timestamp is a valid date constructor.  The code behind our filter is the Intl.DateTimeFormat function, a native function that can be used to format and parse dates to declared locations. To get the local format, we use the navigator global variable.

Chapter 3  Adding form validation with Vuelidate Originally, JavaScript was used just for validating HTML forms before sending these to servers; we didn't have any JavaScript frameworks or the JavaScript ecosystem that we have today. However, one thing remains the same: form validation is to be done first by the JavaScript engine before sending the forms to the server.  We will learn how to use one of the most popular libraries on the Vue ecosystem to validate our input form before sending it.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.  [ 117 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Now, follow these steps to add a form validation into your Vue project, and your form component:  1.  To install Vuelidate, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install vuelidate --save  2.  To add the Vuelidate plugin to the Vue application, we need to import and add it to Vue in the main.js file in the src folder:  3.  In the TaskInput.vue file, we will add a new property to the Vue object. This property is interpreted by the new plugin that was installed. At the end of the object, we will add the validations property, and inside that property, we will add the name of the model. The model is a direct name of the data or computed property that the plugin will check for validation:  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import Vuelidate from 'vuelidate'; import '. style.css';  Vue.config.productionTip = false Vue.use Vuelidate ;  new Vue {   render: h => h App , } .$mount 'app'     export default {   name: 'TaskInput',   data:    =>  {     task: ''   } ,   methods: {     addTask   {       this.$emit 'add-task', this.task ;       this.task = '';     }   },   validations: {     task: {}   } };    [ 118 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  4.  Now, we need to import the rules that already exist on the plugins that we want to use—those will be required and minLength. After the import, we will add those rules to the model:    import { required, minLength } from 'vuelidate lib validators';  export default {   name: 'TaskInput',   data:    =>  {     task: ''   } ,   methods: {     addTask   {       this.$emit 'add-task', this.task ;       this.task = '';     }   },   validations: {     task: {       required,       minLength: minLength 5 ,     }   } };    addTask   {     this.$v.task.$touch  ;     if  this.$v.task.$error  return false;      this.$emit 'add-task', this.task ;     this.task = '';     this.$v.task.$reset  ;     return true; }  [ 119 ]  5.  Now, we need to add the validation before emitting the event. We will use the $touch built-in function to tell the plugin that the field was touched by the user and check for validation. If there are any fields that had any interaction with the user, the plugin will set the flags accordingly. If there are no errors, we will emit the event and we will reset the validation with the $reset function. To do this, we will change the addTask method:   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  6.  To alert the user that there are some errors on the field, we will make the input change the style to a complete red border and have a red text. To do this, we will need to make a conditional class on the input field. This will be attached directly to the model's $error property:                     My task is:        <input         type='text'         :value='task'         @input='task = $event.target.value'         class='taskInput'         :class="$v.task.$error ? 'fieldError' : ''"        >        Add Task               7.  For the class, we can create a fieldError class in the style.css file in the src folder:  .fieldError {   border: 2px solid red !important;   color: red;   border-radius: 3px; }  8.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  [ 120 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... Once installed, the Vuelidate plugin adds a new $v property to the Vue prototype and checks for a new object property in the Vue object, called validations. When this property is defined and has some rules, the plugins check for the model's rules on each update.  Using this new Vue prototype, we can check inside our code for the errors inside the rules we defined, and execute functions to tell the plugin that the field was touched by the user to flag as a dirty field or reset it. Using those features, we're able to add a new conditional class based on the rules that we defined on the task model.  The task model is required and has a minimum of five characters. If those rules are not met, the plugin will mark the model with an error. We take this error and use it to show the user that the task field has an active error. When the user fulfills the requirements, the display of the error disappears and the event can be emitted.

Sometimes, you need to get this data filtered so that it's readable for the user. To do this, we need a combination of the computed properties to form a final set of filters and sorters.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create a simple filter and sorter that will control our initial to-do task list.

[ 122 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Follow these steps to add a set of filters and sorts into your list:  1.  In the App.vue file, at the   part, we will add new computed properties; those will be for sorting and filtering. We will add three new computed properties, baseList, filteredList, and sortedList. The baseList property will be our first manipulation. We will add an id property to the task list via Array.map. As JavaScript arrays start at zero, we will add 1 to the index of the array. The filteredList property will filter the baseList property and return just the unfinished tasks, and the sortedList property will sort the filteredList property so that the last added id property will be the first displayed to the user:    import CurrentTime from ". components CurrentTime.vue"; import TaskInput from ". components TaskInput";  export default {   name: "TodoApp",   components: {     CurrentTime,     TaskInput   },   data:    =>  {     taskList: [],   } ,   computed: {     baseList   {       return [...this.taskList]         .map  t, index  =>  {             ...t,             id: index + 1           }  ;     },     filteredList   {       return [...this.baseList]             .filter t => !t.finishedAt ;     },     sortedList   {       return [...this.filteredList]           .sort  a, b  => b.id - a.id ;     },     displayList   {       return this.sortedList;     }   },   methods: {  [ 123 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3      formatDate value  {       if  !value  return "";       if  typeof value !== "number"  return value;        const browserLocale =         navigator.languages && navigator.languages.length           ? navigator.languages[0]           : navigator.language;       const intlDateTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat browserLocale, {         year: "numeric",         month: "numeric",         day: "numeric",         hour: "numeric",         minute: "numeric"       } ;        return intlDateTime.format new Date value  ;     },     addNewTask task  {       this.taskList.push {         task,         createdAt: Date.now  ,         finishedAt: undefined       } ;     },     changeStatus taskIndex  {       const task = this.taskList[taskIndex];        if  task.finishedAt  {         task.finishedAt = undefined;       } else {         task.finishedAt = Date.now  ;       }     }   } };    2.  On the   part, we will add the Task ID as an indicator and change how the changeStatus method sends the argument. Because now the index is mutable, we can't use it as a variable; it's just a temporary index on the array. We need to use the task id:                     [ 124 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3                                     My Tasks                          <li               v-for=" taskItem, index  in displayList"               :key="`${index}_${Math.random  }`"             >               <input type="checkbox"                 :checked="!!taskItem.finishedAt"                 @input="changeStatus taskItem.id "                >               {{ taskItem.id }} - {{ taskItem.task }}                                  Done at:                 {{ formatDate taskItem.finishedAt  }}                                                                          3.  On the changeStatus method, we need to update our function too. As the index now starts at 1, we need to decrease the index of the array by one to get the real  index of the element before updating it:  changeStatus taskId  {     const task = this.taskList[taskId - 1];      if  task.finishedAt  {     task.finishedAt = undefined;     } else {     task.finishedAt = Date.now  ;     } }  4.

The computed properties worked together as a cache for the list and made sure there were no side effects on the manipulation of the elements:  1.  2.  3.  At the baseList property, we created a new array with the same tasks but added a new id property to the task. At the filteredList property, we took the baseList property and only returned the tasks that weren't finished. At the sortedList property, we sorted the tasks on the filteredList property by their ID, in descending order.  When all the manipulation was done, the displayList property returned the result of the data that was manipulated.

Creating conditional filters to sort list data After completing the previous recipe, your data should be filtered and sorted, but you might need to check the filtered data or need to change how it was sorted. In this recipe, we will learn how to create conditional filters and sort the data on a list.   Using some basic principles, it's possible to gather information and display it in many different ways.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.  [ 127 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  Now, follow these steps to add a conditional filter to sort your list data:  1.  In the App.vue file, at the   part, we will update the computed properties, filteredList, sortedList, and displayList. We need to add three new variables to our project, hideDone, reverse, and sortById. All three are going to be Boolean variables and will start with a default value of false. The filteredList property will check if the hideDone variable is true. If it is, it will have the same behavior, but if not, it will show the whole list with no filter. The sortedList property will check if the sortById variable is true. If it is, it will have the same behavior, but if not, it will sort the list by the finished date of the task. The displayList property will check if the reverse variable is true. If it is, it will reverse the displayed list, but if not, it will have the same behavior:    import CurrentTime from ". components CurrentTime.vue"; import TaskInput from ". components TaskInput";  export default {   name: "TodoApp",   components: {     CurrentTime,     TaskInput   },   data:    =>  {     taskList: [],     hideDone: false,     reverse: false,     sortById: false,   } ,   computed: {     baseList   {       return [...this.taskList]         .map  t, index  =>  {             ...t,             id: index + 1           }  ;     },     filteredList   {       return this.hideDone         ? [...this.baseList]             .filter t => !t.finishedAt          : [...this.baseList];     },     sortedList   {       return [...this.filteredList]           .sort  a, b  =>    [ 128 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3              this.sortById               ? b.id - a.id               :  a.finishedAt  0  -  b.finishedAt  0              ;     },     displayList   {       const taskList = [...this.sortedList];        return this.reverse       ? taskList.reverse         : taskList;     }   },   methods: {     formatDate value  {       if  !value  return "";       if  typeof value !== "number"  return value;        const browserLocale =         navigator.languages && navigator.languages.length           ? navigator.languages[0]           : navigator.language;        const intlDateTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat browserLocale, {         year: "numeric",         month: "numeric",         day: "numeric",         hour: "numeric",         minute: "numeric"       } ;        return intlDateTime.format new Date value  ;     },     addNewTask task  {       this.taskList.push {         task,         createdAt: Date.now  ,         finishedAt: undefined       } ;     },     changeStatus taskId  {       const task = this.taskList[taskId - 1];        if  task.finishedAt  {         task.finishedAt = undefined;       } else {         task.finishedAt = Date.now  ;       }  [ 129 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3      }   } };    2.  On the   part, we need to add the controllers for those variables. We will create three checkboxes, linked directly to the variables via the v-model directive:                                                       My Tasks                                      <input               v-model="hideDone"               type="checkbox"               id="hideDone"               name="hideDone"              >                             Hide Done Tasks                                                   <input               v-model="reverse"               type="checkbox"               id="reverse"               name="reverse"              >                             Reverse Order                                                   <input               v-model="sortById"               type="checkbox"               id="sortById"               name="sortById"              >                [ 130 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3                Sort By Id                                                   <li               v-for=" taskItem, index  in displayList"               :key="`${index}_${Math.random  }`"             >               <input type="checkbox"                 :checked="!!taskItem.finishedAt"                 @input="changeStatus taskItem.id "                >               {{ taskItem.id }} - {{ taskItem.task }}                                  Done at:                 {{ formatDate taskItem.finishedAt  }}                                                                          3.

The computed properties worked together as a cache for the list and made sure there weren't any side effects on the manipulation of the elements. With the conditional process, it was possible to change the rules of the filtering and sorting through a variable, and the display was updated in real-time:  Chapter 3  1.  2.  3.  At the filteredList property, we took the baseList property and returned just the tasks that weren't finished. When the hideDone variable was false, we returned the whole list without any filter. At the sortedList property, we sorted the tasks on the filteredList property. When the sortById variable was true, the list was sorted by ID in descending order; when it was false, the sorting was done by the task finish time in ascending order. At the displayList property,  when the reverse variable was true, the final list was reversed.  When all the manipulation was done, the displayList property returned the result of the data that was manipulated.  Those computed properties were controlled by the checkboxes on the user screen, so the user had total control of what they could see and how they could see it.

Adding custom styles and transitions Adding styles in your components is a good practice, as it allows you to show your user what is happening more clearly. By doing this, you are able to show a visual response to the user and also give a better experience on your application.  [ 132 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  In this recipe, we will learn how to add a new kind of conditional class binding. We will use CSS effects mixed with the re-rendering that comes with each new Vue update.

We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.  Follow these steps to add custom styles and transitions to your component:  1.  In the App.vue file, we will add a conditional class to the list items for the tasks that are done:                                                       My Tasks                                      <input               v-model="hideDone"               type="checkbox"               id="hideDone"               name="hideDone"              >                [ 133 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3                Hide Done Tasks                                                   <input               v-model="reverse"               type="checkbox"               id="reverse"               name="reverse"              >                             Reverse Order                                                   <input               v-model="sortById"               type="checkbox"               id="sortById"               name="sortById"              >                             Sort By Id                                                   <li               v-for=" taskItem, index  in displayList"               :key="`${index}_${Math.random  }`"               :class="!!taskItem.finishedAt ?

At the   part of the component, we will create the CSS style sheet classes for the taskDone CSS class. We need to make the list have a separator between the items; then, we will make the list have a striped style; and when they get marked as done, the background will change with an effect. To add the separator between the lines and the striped list or zebra style, we need to add a CSS style sheet rule that applies for each even nth-child of our list:  3.  To add the effect on the background, when the task is done, at the end of the   part, we will add a CSS animation keyframe that indicates the  background color change and apply this animation to the .taskDone CSS class:       .taskList li {     list-style: none;     text-align: left;     padding: 5px 10px;     border-bottom: 1px solid rgba 0,0,0,0.15 ;   }    .taskList li:last-child {     border-bottom: 0px;   }    .taskList li:nth-child even {     background-color: rgba 0,0,0,0.05 ;   }        .taskList li {     list-style: none;     text-align: left;     padding: 5px 10px;     border-bottom: 1px solid rgba 0,0,0,0.15 ;   }    .taskList li:last-child {     border-bottom: 0px;   }    .taskList li:nth-child even {     background-color: rgba 0,0,0,0.05 ;   }    @keyframes colorChange {     from{       background-color: inherit;  [ 135 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3      }     to{       background-color: rgba 0, 160, 24, 0.577 ;     }   }    .taskList li.taskDone{     animation: colorChange 1s ease;     background-color: rgba 0, 160, 24, 0.577 ;   }    4.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the  following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... Each time a new item in our application is marked as done, the displayList property gets updated and triggers the re-rendering of the component.  Because of this, our taskDone CSS class has an animation attached to it that is executed on rendering, showing a green background.

This tool shows us the depths of the Vue components, routes, events, and vuex.  With the help of the vue-devtools extension, it's possible to debug our application, try new data before changing our code, execute functions without needing to call them in our code directly, and so much more.  In this recipe, we will learn more about how we can use the devtools to find more information on your application and how it can be used to help your debug process.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  You will need to install the vue-devtools extension in your browser: Chrome extension—http: ​ ​bit.​ly ​chrome-​vue-​devtools Firefox extension—http: ​ ​bit.​ly ​firefox-​vue-​devtools  [ 137 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties How to do it... We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.  Chapter 3  When developing any Vue application, it's always a good practice to develop with vue- devtools to hand.   Follow these steps to understand how to use vue-devtools and how to properly debug a Vue application:  1.  To enter vue-devtools, you need to have it installed in your browser first, so check the 'Getting ready' section of this recipe for the links to the extension for Chrome or Firefox. In your Vue development application, enter browser developer inspector mode. A new tab with the name Vue must appear:  [ 138 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  2.  The first tab that you are presented with is the Components tab. This tab shows your application component tree. If you click on a component, you will be able to see all the available data, the computed property, extra data injected by plugins such as vuelidate, vue-router, or vuex. You can edit the data to see the changes in the application in real time:  3.  The second tab is for vuex development. This tab will show the history of the mutations, the current state, and the getters. It's possible to check on each mutation the passed payload and do time-travel mutations, to "go back in time" in the vuex changes in the states:  [ 139 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  4.  The third tab is dedicated to event emitters in the application. All events that are emitted in the application will be shown here. You can check the event that was emitted by clicking on it. You can see the name of the event, the type, who was the source of the event  in this case, it was a component , and the payload:  [ 140 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  5.  The fourth tab is dedicated to the vue-router plugin. There, you can see the navigation history, with all the metadata passed to the new route. You can check all the available routes in your application:  6.   The fifth tab is a Performance tab. Here, you can check your component loading time, the frames per second that your application is running by the events that are happening in real time. This first screenshot shows the current frames per second of the current application, and for the selected component:  [ 141 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  This second screenshot shows the components lifecycle hooks performance and the time it took to execute each hook:  7.  The sixth tab is your Settings tab; here, you can manage the extension, change how it looks, how it behaves internally, and how it will behave within the Vue plugins:  [ 142 ]   Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties  Chapter 3  8.  The last tab is a refresh button for the vue-devtools. Sometimes, when the hot-module-reload occurs or when some complex events happen in your application component tree, the extension can lose track of what is happening. This button forces the extension to reload and read the Vue application state again.  See also You can find more information about vue-devtools at https: ​ ​github.​com ​vuejs ​vue- devtools.  [ 143 ]   4  Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Building a Vue application is like putting a puzzle together. Each piece of the puzzle is a component, and each piece has a slot to fill.  Components play a big part in Vue development. In Vue, each part of your code will be a component—it could be a layout, page, container, or button, but ultimately, it's a component. Learning how to interact with them and reuse them is the key to cleaning up code and performance in your Vue application. Components are the code that will, in the end, render something on the screen, whatever the size might be.  In this chapter, we will learn about how we can make a visual component that can be reused in many places. We'll use slots to place data inside our components, create functional components for seriously fast rendering, implement direct communication between parent and child components, and finally, look at loading your components asynchronously.  Let's put these all those pieces together and create the beautiful puzzle that is a Vue application.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Creating a visual template component Using slots and named slots to place data inside your components Passing data to your component and validating the data Creating functional components Accessing your children components data Creating a dynamic injected component Creating a dependency injection component   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  Creating a component mixin Lazy loading your components  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.  Attention Windows users: you need to install an NPM package called windows-build-tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do so, open PowerShell as an administrator and execute the following command:  > npm install -g windows-build-tools  To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  Creating a visual template component Components can be data-driven, stateless, stateful, or a simple visual component. But what is a visual component? A visual component is a component that has only one purpose: visual manipulation.  A visual component could have a simple Scoped CSS with some div HTML elements, or it could be a more complex component that can calculate the position of the element on the screen in real-time.  We will create a card wrapper component that follows the Material Design guide.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  [ 145 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or we can start a new one.   To start a new project, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create visual-component  The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue, and the spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys  ❯ default  babel, eslint    Manually select features ‌  Now, let's follow these steps and create a visual template component:  1.  2.  Let's create a new file called MaterialCardBox.vue in the src components folder. In this file, we will start with the template of our component. We need to create the box for the card. By using the Material Design guide, this box will have a shadow and rounded corners:           This is a Material Card Box          [ 146 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  3.  In the   part of our component, we will add just our basic name:      export default {    name: 'MaterialCardBox',   };    4.  We need to create our elevation CSS stylesheet rules. To do this, create a file named elevation.css in the style folder. There, we will create the elevations from 0 to 24, to follow all the elevations on the Material Design guide:  .elevation_0 {     border: 1px solid rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_1 {     box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 1px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 2px 1px -1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_2 {     box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 2px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 3px 1px -2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_3 {     box-shadow: 0 1px 8px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 3px 4px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 3px 3px -2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_4 {     box-shadow: 0 2px 4px -1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 4px 5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 1px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_5 {     box-shadow: 0 3px 5px -1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 5px 8px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 1px 14px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_6 {     box-shadow: 0 3px 5px -1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,  [ 147 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4          0 6px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 1px 18px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_7 {     box-shadow: 0 4px 5px -2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 7px 10px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 2px 16px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_8 {     box-shadow: 0 5px 5px -3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 8px 10px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 3px 14px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_9 {     box-shadow: 0 5px 6px -3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 9px 12px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 3px 16px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_10 {     box-shadow: 0 6px 6px -3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 10px 14px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 4px 18px 3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_11 {     box-shadow: 0 6px 7px -4px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 11px 15px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 4px 20px 3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_12 {     box-shadow: 0 7px 8px -4px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 12px 17px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 5px 22px 4px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_13 {     box-shadow: 0 7px 8px -4px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 13px 19px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 5px 24px 4px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_14 {     box-shadow: 0 7px 9px -4px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,  [ 148 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4          0 14px 21px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 5px 26px 4px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_15 {     box-shadow: 0 8px 9px -5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 15px 22px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 6px 28px 5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_16 {     box-shadow: 0 8px 10px -5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 16px 24px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 6px 30px 5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_17 {     box-shadow: 0 8px 11px -5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 17px 26px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 6px 32px 5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_18 {     box-shadow: 0 9px 11px -5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 18px 28px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 7px 34px 6px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_19 {     box-shadow: 0 9px 12px -6px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 19px 29px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 7px 36px 6px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_20 {     box-shadow: 0 10px 13px -6px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 20px 31px 3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 8px 38px 7px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_21 {     box-shadow: 0 10px 13px -6px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 21px 33px 3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 8px 40px 7px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_22 {     box-shadow: 0 10px 14px -6px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,  [ 149 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4          0 22px 35px 3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 8px 42px 7px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_23 {     box-shadow: 0 11px 14px -7px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 23px 36px 3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 9px 44px 8px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  .elevation_24 {     box-shadow: 0 11px 15px -7px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,         0 24px 38px 3px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,         0 9px 46px 8px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; }  5.  For styling our card in the   part of the component, we need to set the scoped attribute inside the   tag to make sure that the visual style won't interfere with any other components within our application. We will make this card follow the Material Design guide. We need to import the Roboto font family and apply it to all elements that will be wrapped inside this component:      @import url 'https:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Roboto:400,500,700&dis play=swap' ;   @import '.. style elevation.css';    *{     font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;   }   .cardBox{       width: 100%;   max-width: 300px;     background-color: fff;     position: relative;     display: inline-block;     border-radius: 0.25rem;   }   .cardBox > .section {     padding: 1rem;     position: relative;   }    [ 150 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  6.

Using slots and named slots to place data inside your components Sometimes the pieces of the puzzle go missing, and you find yourself with a blank spot. Imagine that you could fill that empty spot with a piece that you crafted yourself, not the original one that came with the puzzle box. That's a rough analogy for what a Vue slot is.  [ 151 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  Vue slots are like open spaces in your component that other components can fill with text, HTML elements, or other Vue components. You can declare where the slot will be and how it will behave in your component.   With this technique, you can create a component and, when needed, customize it without any effort at all.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in the Creating Your first project with Vue CLI recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the Creating a visual template component recipe.  Follow these instructions to create slots and named slots in components:  1. 2.  Let's open the file called MaterialCardBox.vue in the components folder. In the   part of the component, we will need to add four main sections on the card. Those sections are based on the Material Design card anatomy and are the header, media, main section, and action areas. We will use the default slot for the main section, and the rest will all be named scopes. For some named slots, we will add a fallback configuration that will be displayed if the user doesn't choose any setting on the slot:                    <slot         v-if="$slots.header"         name="header"  [ 152 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4         >                             Card Header                               Card Sub Header                                     <slot         v-if="$slots.media"         name="media"        >       <img         v-else         src="https:  via.placeholder.com 350x250"       >           <div       v-if="$slots.default"       class="section cardText"       :class="{         noBottomPadding: $slots.action,         halfPaddingTop: $slots.media,       }"     >                   <div       v-if="$slots.action"       class="action"     >                      3.  Now, we need to create our text CSS stylesheet rules for the component. In the style folder, create a new file called cardStyles.css, and there we will add the rules for the card text and headers:  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6{     margin: 0; } .cardText{     -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;  [ 153 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4      -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;     text-decoration: inherit;     text-transform: inherit;     font-size: 0.875rem;     line-height: 1.375rem;     letter-spacing: 0.0071428571em; } h1.cardHeader{     font-size: 1.25rem;     line-height: 2rem;     font-weight: 500;     letter-spacing: .0125em; } h2.cardSubHeader{     font-size: .875rem;     line-height: 1.25rem;     font-weight: 400;     letter-spacing: .0178571429em;     opacity: .6; }  4.  In the   part of the component, we need to create some CSS stylesheets to follow the rules of our design guide:    @import url "https:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Roboto:400,500,700&dis play=swap" ; @import ".. style elevation.css"; @import ".. style cardStyles.css";  * {   font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif; }  .cardBox {   width: 100%;   max-width: 300px;   border-radius: 0.25rem;   background-color: fff;   position: relative;   display: inline-block;   box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 , 0 2px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,     0 3px 1px -2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ; } .cardBox > .header {   padding: 1rem;  [ 154 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4    position: relative;   display: block; } .cardBox > .media {   overflow: hidden;   position: relative;   display: block;   max-width: 100%; } .cardBox > .section {   padding: 1rem;   position: relative;   margin-bottom: 1.5rem;   display: block; } .cardBox > .action {   padding: 0.5rem;   position: relative;   display: block; } .cardBox > .action > *:not :first-child  {   margin-left: 0.4rem; } .noBottomPadding {   padding-bottom: 0 !important; } .halfPaddingTop {   padding-top: 0.5rem !important; }    5.  In the App.vue file, in the src folder, we need to add elements to those slots. Those elements will be added to each one of the named slots, and for the default slot. We will change the component in the   part of the file. To add a named slot, we need to use a directive called v-slot: and then the name of the slot we want to use:                               Card Title            Card Sub-Title                                     [ 155 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4         Main Section                   Action Button           Action Button                       For the default slot, we don't need to use a directive; it just needs to be wrapped in the component to be placed in the   part of the component.  6.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  [ 156 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components How it works... Slots are places where you can put anything that can be rendered into the DOM. We choose the position of our slot and tell the component where to render when it receives any information.  Chapter 4  In this recipe, we used named slots, which are designed to work with a component that requires more than one slot. To place any information in that component within the Vue single file  .vue    part, you need to add the v-slot: directive so that Vue is able to know where to place the information that was passed down.

You can find more information about the Material Design card anatomy at https: ​  material.​io ​components ​cards ​anatomy.  Passing data to your component and validating the data You now know how to place data inside your component through slots, but those slots were made for HTML DOM elements or Vue components. Sometimes, you need to pass data such as strings, arrays, Booleans, or even objects.  The whole application is like a puzzle, where each piece is a component. Communication between components is an important part of it. The possibility to pass data to a component is the first step to connect the puzzle, and then validating the data is the final step to connect the pieces.  In this recipe, we will learn how to pass data to a component and validate the data that was passed to the component.  [ 157 ]   Chapter 4  Components, Mixins, and Functional Components Getting ready The pre-requisite is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in the recipe Creating Your first project with Vue CLI in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the Using slots and name slots to place data inside your components recipe.  Follow these instructions to pass data to the component and validate it:  1. 2.  Let's open the file called MaterialCardBox.vue in the src components folder. In the   part of the component, we create a new property, called props. This property receives the component data, and that data can be used for visual manipulation, variables inside your code, or a function that needs to be executed. In this property, we need to declare the name of the attribute, the type, if it's required, and the validation function. This function will be executed at runtime to validate whether the passed attribute is a valid one:    export default {   name: 'MaterialCardBox',   inheritAttrs: false,   props: {     header: {       type: String,       required: false,       default: '',       validator: v => typeof v === 'string',     },     subHeader: {       type: String,       required: false,       default: '',       validator: v => typeof v === 'string',  [ 158 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4      },     mainText: {       type: String,       required: false,       default: '',       validator: v => typeof v === 'string',     },     showMedia: {       type: Boolean,       required: false,       default: false,       validator: v => typeof v === 'boolean',     },     imgSrc: {       type: String,       required: false,       default: '',       validator: v => typeof v === 'string',     },     showActions: {       type: Boolean,       required: false,       default: false,       validator: v => typeof v === 'boolean',     },     elevation: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 2,       validator: v => typeof v === 'number',     },   },   computed: {}, };    3.  In the computed property, in the   part of the component, we need to create a set of visual manipulation rules that will be used for rendering the card. Those rules will be showMediaContent, showActionsButtons, showHeader, and cardElevation. Each rule will check the received props and the $slots objects to see whether the relevant card part needs to be rendered:    computed: {     showMediaContent   {       return  this.$slots.media  this.imgSrc  && this.showMedia;     },     showActionsButtons   {  [ 159 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4        return this.showActions && this.$slots.action;     },     showHeader   {       return this.$slots.header   this.header  this.subHeader ;     },     showMainContent   {       return this.$slots.default  this.mainText;     },     cardElevation   {       return `elevation_${parseInt this.elevation, 10 }`;     },   },  4.  After adding the visual manipulation rules, we need to add the created rules to the   part of our component. They will affect the appearance and behavior of our card. For example, if there is no header slot defined, and there is a header property defined, we show the fallback header. That header is the data that was passed down via props:      <div     class="cardBox"     :class="cardElevation"   >     <div       v-if="showHeader"       class="header"     >       <slot         v-if="$slots.header"         name="header"        >                             {{ header }}                               {{ subHeader }}                             <div       v-if="showMediaContent"       class="media"     >       <slot         v-if="$slots.media"  [ 160 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4          name="media"        >       <img         v-else         :src="imgSrc"       >           <div       v-if="showMainContent"       class="section cardText"       :class="{         noBottomPadding: $slots.action,         halfPaddingTop: $slots.media,       }"     >               <p         v-else         class="cardText"       >         {{ mainText }}                   <div       v-if="showActionsButtons"       class="action"     >       <slot         v-if="$slots.action"         name="action"        >              [ 161 ]  5.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... Each Vue component is a JavaScript object that has a render function. This render function is called when it is time to render it in the HTML DOM. A single file component is an abstraction of this object.  When we are declaring that our component has unique props that can be passed, it opens a tiny door for other components or JavaScript to place information inside our component. We are then able to use those values inside our component to render data, do some calculations, or make visual rules.  [ 162 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  In our case, using the single file component, we are passing those rules as HTML attributes because vue-template-compiler will take those attributes and transform them into JavaScript objects.  When those values are passed to our component, Vue first checks whether the passed attribute matches the correct type, and then we execute our validation function on top of each value to see whether it matches what we'd expect.  After all of this is done, the component life cycle continues, and we can render our component.

You can find more information about vue-template-compiler at https: ​ ​vue-​loader. vuejs.​org ​guide ​.  Creating functional components The beauty of functional components is their simplicity. They're a stateless component, without any data, computed property, or even a life cycle. They're just a render function that is called when the data that is passed changed.   You may be wondering how this can be useful. Well, a functional component is a perfect companion for UI components that don't need to keep any data inside them, or visual components that are just rendered components that don't require any data manipulation.  As the name implies, they are simple function components, and they have nothing more than the render function. They are a stripped-down version of a component used exclusively for performance rendering and visual elements.

Now, follow these instructions to create a Vue functional component:  1. 2.  3.  Create a new file called MaterialButton.vue in the src components folder. In this component, we need to validate whether the prop we'll receive is a valid color. To do this, install in the project the is-color module. You'll need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install --save is-color  In the   part of our component, we need to create the props object that the functional component will receive. As a functional component is just a render function with no state – it's stateless – the   part of the component is trimmed down to props, injections, and slots. There will be four props objects: backgroundColor, textColor, isRound, and isFlat. These won't be required when installing the component, as we will have a default value defined in props:      import isColor from 'is-color';    export default {     name: 'MaterialButton',     props: {  [ 164 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4        backgroundColor: {         type: String,         required: false,         default: 'fff',         validator: v => typeof v === 'string' && isColor v ,       },       textColor: {         type: String,         required: false,         default: '000',         validator: v => typeof v === 'string' && isColor v ,       },       isRound: {         type: Boolean,         required: false,         default: false,       },       isFlat: {         type: Boolean,         required: false,         default: false,       },     },   };    4.  In the   part of our component, we first need to add the functional attribute to the   tag to indicate to the vue-template- compiler that this component is a functional component. We need to create a button HTML element, with a basic class attribute button and a dynamic class attribute based on the props object received. Different from the normal component, we need to specify the props property in order to use the functional component. For the style of the button, we need to create a dynamic style attribute, also based on props. To emit all the event listeners directly to the parent, we can call the v-on directive and pass the listeners property. This will bind all the event listeners without needing to declare each one. Inside the button, we will add a div HTML element for visual enhancement, and add   where the text will be placed:      <button     tabindex="0"     class="button"     :class="{       round: props.isRound,       isFlat: props.isFlat,  [ 165 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4      }"     :style="{       background: props.backgroundColor,       color: props.textColor     }"     v-on="listeners"   >     <div       tabindex="-1"       class="button_focus_helper"      >              5.  Now, let's make it pretty. In the   part of the component, we need to create all the CSS stylesheet rules for this button. We need to add the scoped attribute to   so that all the CSS stylesheet rules won't affect any other elements in our application:      .button {     user-select: none;     position: relative;     outline: 0;     border: 0;     border-radius: 0.25rem;     vertical-align: middle;     cursor: pointer;     padding: 4px 16px;     font-size: 14px;     line-height: 1.718em;     text-decoration: none;     color: inherit;     background: transparent;     transition: 0.3s cubic-bezier 0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1 ;     min-height: 2.572em;     font-weight: 500;     text-transform: uppercase;   }   .button:not .isFlat {     box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,     0 2px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,     0 3px 1px -2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ;   }    .button:not .isFlat :focus:before,  [ 166 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4    .button:not .isFlat :active:before,   .button:not .isFlat :hover:before {     content: '';     position: absolute;     top: 0;     right: 0;     bottom: 0;     left: 0;     border-radius: inherit;     transition: 0.3s cubic-bezier 0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1 ;   }    .button:not .isFlat :focus:before,   .button:not .isFlat :active:before,   .button:not .isFlat :hover:before {     box-shadow: 0 3px 5px -1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.2 ,     0 5px 8px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.14 ,     0 1px 14px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.12 ;   }    .button_focus_helper {     position: absolute;     top: 0;     left: 0;     width: 100%;     height: 100%;     pointer-events: none;     border-radius: inherit;     outline: 0;     opacity: 0;     transition: background-color 0.3s cubic-bezier 0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1 ,     opacity 0.4s cubic-bezier 0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1 ;   }    .button_focus_helper:after, .button_focus_helper:before {     content: '';     position: absolute;     top: 0;     left: 0;     width: 100%;     height: 100%;     opacity: 0;     border-radius: inherit;     transition: background-color 0.3s cubic-bezier 0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1 ,     opacity 0.6s cubic-bezier 0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1 ;   }  [ 167 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4    .button_focus_helper:before {     background: 000;   }    .button_focus_helper:after {     background: fff;   }    .button:focus .button_focus_helper:before,   .button:hover .button_focus_helper:before {     opacity: .1;   }    .button:focus .button_focus_helper:after,   .button:hover .button_focus_helper:after {     opacity: .6;   }    .button:focus .button_focus_helper,   .button:hover .button_focus_helper {     opacity: 0.2;   }    .round {     border-radius: 50%;   }    6.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  [ 168 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... Functional components are as simple as a render function. They don't have any sort of data, function, or access to the outside world.  They were first introduced in Vue as a JavaScript object render   function only; later, they were added to vue-template-compiler for the Vue single file application.  A functional component works by receiving two arguments: createElement and context. As we saw in the single file, we only had access to the elements as they weren't in the this property of the JavaScript object. This occurs because as the context is passed to the render function, there is no this property.  [ 169 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  A functional component provides the fastest rendering possible on Vue, as it doesn't depend on the life cycle of a component to check for the rendering; it just renders each time data is changed.

You can find more information about the is-color module at https: ​ ​www.​npmjs.​com  package ​is-​color.  Accessing your children components data Normally, parent-child communications are done via events or props. But sometimes, you need to access data, functions, or computed properties that exist in the child or the parent function.  Vue provides a way to interact in both ways, opening doors to communications and events, such as props and event listeners.  There is another way to access the data between the components: by using direct access. This can be done with the help of a special attribute in the template when using the single file component or a direct call of the object inside the JavaScript. This method is seen by some as a little lazy, but there are times when there really is no other way to do it than this.  Getting ready The pre-requisite is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 170 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components How to do it... To start your component, create your Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating functional components' recipe.  Chapter 4  We're going to separate the recipe into four parts. The first three parts will cover the creation of new components –  StarRatingInput, StarRatingDisplay, and StarRating – and the last part will cover the parent-child direct manipulation of the data and function access.  Creating the star rating input We are going to create a star rating input, based on a five-star ranking system.  Follow these steps to create a custom star rating input:  1. 2.  Create a new file called StarRatingInput.vue in the src components folder. In the   part of the component, create a maxRating property in the props property that is a number, non-required, and has a default value of 5. In the data property, we need to create our rating property, with the default value of 0. In the methods property, we need to create three methods: updateRating, emitFinalVoting, and getStarName. The updateRating method will save the rating to the data, emitFinalVoting will call updateRating and emit the rating to the parent component through a final-vote event, and getStarName will receive a value and return the icon name of the star:    export default {   name: 'StarRatingInput',   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },   },   data:    =>  {     rating: 0,   } ,   methods: {     updateRating value  {  [ 171 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4        this.rating = value;     },     emitFinalVote value  {       this.updateRating value ;       this.$emit 'final-vote', this.rating ;     },     getStarName rate  {       if  rate <= this.rating  {         return 'star';       }       if  Math.fround  rate - this.rating   < 1  {         return 'star_half';       }       return 'star_border';     },   }, };    3.  In the   part of the component, we need to create a   component to place the text before the star rating. We'll create a dynamic list of stars based on the maxRating value that we received via the props property. Each star that is created will have a listener attached to it in the mouseenter, focus, and click events. mouseenter and focus, when fired, will call the updateRating method, and click will call emitFinalVote:                                        <li         v-for="rate in maxRating"         :key="rate"         @mouseenter="updateRating rate "         @click="emitFinalVote rate "         @focus="updateRating rate "       >                     {{ getStarName rate  }}                                [ 172 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  4.  We need to import the Material Design icons into our application. Create a new styling file in the styles folder called materialIcons.css, and add the CSS stylesheet rules for font-family:  @font-face {   font-family: 'Material Icons';   font-style: normal;   font-weight: 400;   src: url https:  fonts.gstatic.com s materialicons v48 flUhRq6tzZclQEJ-       Vdg-IuiaDsNcIhQ8tQ.woff2  format 'woff2' ; }  5.  Open the main.js file and import the created stylesheet into it. The css- loader webpack will handle the processing of imported .css files in JavaScript files. This will help development because you don't need to re-import the file elsewhere:  .material-icons {   font-family: 'Material Icons' !important;   font-weight: normal;   font-style: normal;   font-size: 24px;   line-height: 1;   letter-spacing: normal;   text-transform: none;   display: inline-block;   white-space: nowrap;   word-wrap: normal;   direction: ltr;   -webkit-font-feature-settings: 'liga';   -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; }  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import '. style materialIcons.css';  Vue.config.productionTip = false;  new Vue {   render: h => h App , } .$mount 'app' ;  [ 173 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  6.  To style our component, we will create a common styling file in the src style folder called starRating.css. There we will add the common styles that will be shared between the StarRatingDisplay and StarRatingInput components:  .starRating {   user-select: none;   display: flex;   flex-direction: row; } .starRating * {   line-height: 0.9rem; } .starRating .material-icons {   font-size: .9rem !important;   color: orange; }  ul {   display: inline-block;   padding: 0;   margin: 0; }  ul > li {   list-style: none;   float: left; }      @import '.. style starRating.css';    .starRating {     justify-content: space-between;   }    .starRating * {     line-height: 1.7rem;   }  [ 174 ]  7.  In the   part of the component, we need to create all the CSS stylesheet rules. Then, on the StarRatingInput.vue component file located in the src components folder we need to add the scoped attribute to   so that all the CSS stylesheet rules won't affect any other elements in our application. Here, we will import the common styles that we created and add new ones for the input:   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4    .starRating .material-icons {     font-size: 1.6rem !important;   }    .rateThis {     display: inline-block;     color: rgba 0, 0, 0, .65 ;     font-size: 1rem;   }    8.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  [ 175 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components Creating the StarRatingDisplay component Now that we have our input, we need a way to display the selected choice to the user. Follow these steps to create a StarRatingDisplay component:  Chapter 4  1.  2.  Create a new component called StarRatingDisplay.vue in the src components folder. In the   part of the component, in the props property, we need to create three new properties: maxRating, rating, and votes. All three of them will be numbers and non-required and have a default value. In the methods property, we need to create a new method called getStarName, which will receive a value and return the icon name of the star:    export default {   name: 'StarRatingDisplay',   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },     rating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },     votes: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },   },   methods: {     getStarName rate  {       if  rate <= this.rating  {         return 'star';       }       if  Math.fround  rate - this.rating   < 1  {         return 'star_half';       }       return 'star_border';     },   }, };    [ 176 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  3.  In  , we need to create a dynamic list of stars based on the maxRating value that we received via the props property. After the list, we need to display that we received votes, and if we receive any votes, we will display them too:                    <li         v-for="rate in maxRating"         :key="rate"       >                     {{ getStarName rate  }}                                     {{ rating }}           <span       v-if="votes"       class="votes"     >        {{ votes }}                   @import '.. style starRating.css';    .rating, .votes {     display: inline-block;     color: rgba 0,0,0, .65 ;     font-size: .75rem;     margin-left: .4rem;   }    [ 177 ]  4.  In the   part of the component, we need to create all the CSS stylesheet rules. We need to add the scoped attribute to   so that all the CSS stylesheet rules won't affect any other elements in our application. Here, we will import the common styles that we created and add new ones for the display:   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  5.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  [ 178 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components Creating the StarRating component After creating the input and the display, we need to join both together in a single component. This component will be the final component that we'll use in the application.  Chapter 4  Follow these steps to create the final StarRating component:  1. 2.  Create a new file called StarRating.vue in the src components folder. In the   part of the component, we need to import the StarRatingDisplay and StarRatingInput components. In the props property, we need to create three new properties: maxRating, rating, and votes. All three of them will be numbers and non-required, with a default value. In the data property, we need to create our rating property, with a default value of 0, and a property called voted, with a default value of false. In the methods property, we need to add a new method called vote, which will receive rank as an argument. It will define rating as the received value and define the inside variable of the voted component as true:    import StarRatingInput from '. StarRatingInput.vue'; import StarRatingDisplay from '. StarRatingDisplay.vue';  export default {   name: 'StarRating',   components: { StarRatingDisplay, StarRatingInput },   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },     rating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },     votes: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },   },   data:    =>  {     rank: 0,  [ 179 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  3.  In the   part, we will place both the components, displaying the input of the rating:      voted: false,   } ,   methods: {     vote rank  {       this.rank = rank;       this.voted = true;     },   }, };              <StarRatingInput       v-if="!voted"       :max-rating="maxRating"       @final-vote="vote"     >       Rate this Place           <StarRatingDisplay       v-else       :max-rating="maxRating"       :rating="rating  rank"       :votes="votes"      >        Data manipulation on child components Now that all of our components are ready, we need to add them to our application. The base application will access the child component, and it will set the rating to 5 stars.  Now, follow these steps to understand and manipulate the data in the child components:  1.  In the App.vue file, in the   part of the component, remove the main-text attribute of the MaterialCardBox component and place it as the default slot of the component.   [ 180 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  2.  Before the placed text, we will add the StarRating component. We will add a ref attribute to it. This attribute will indicate to Vue to link this component directly to a special property in the this object of the component. In the action buttons, we will add the listeners for the click event—one for resetVote and another for forceVote:            <MaterialCardBox       header="Material Card Header"       sub-header="Card Sub Header"       show-media       show-actions       img-src="https:  picsum.photos 300 200"     >                 <StarRating           ref="starRating"          >                         The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the            iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.                         <MaterialButton           background-color="027be3"           text-color="fff"           @click="resetVote"         >           Reset                   <MaterialButton           background-color="26a69a"           text-color="fff"           is-flat           @click="forceVote"         >           Rate 5 Stars                                [ 181 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  3.  In the   part of the component, we will create a methods property, and add two new methods: resetVote and forceVote. Those methods will access the StarRating component and reset the data or set the data to a 5-star vote, respectively:    import MaterialCardBox from '. components MaterialCardBox.vue'; import MaterialButton from '. components MaterialButton.vue'; import StarRating from '. components StarRating.vue';  export default {   name: 'App',   components: {     StarRating,     MaterialButton,     MaterialCardBox,   },   methods: {     resetVote   {       this.$refs.starRating.rank = 0;       this.$refs.starRating.voted = false;     },     forceVote   {       this.$refs.starRating.rank = 5;       this.$refs.starRating.voted = true;     },   }, };    How it works... When the ref property is added to the component, Vue adds a link to the referenced element to the $refs property inside the this property object of JavaScript. From there, you have full access to the component.  This method is commonly used to manipulate HTML DOM elements without the need to call for document query selector functions.   However, the main function of this property is to give access to the Vue component directly, enabling you the ability to execute functions and see the computed properties, variables, and changed variables of the component—like full access to the component from the outside.  [ 182 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components There's more... In the same way that a parent can access a child component, a child can access a parent component by calling $parent on the this object. An event can access the root element of the Vue application by calling the $root property.

Creating a dynamic injected component There are some cases where your component can be defined by the kind of variable you are receiving or the type of data that you have; then, you need to change the component on the fly, without the need to set a lot of Vue v-if, v-else-if, and v-else directives.  In those cases, the best thing to do is to use dynamic components, when a computed property or a function can define the component that will be used to be rendered, and the decision is taken in real time.  These decisions sometimes can be simple if there are two responses, but they can be more complex with a long switch case, where you may have a long list of possible components to be used.  Getting ready The pre-requisite is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 183 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Accessing your children components data' recipe.  Chapter 4  Follow these steps to create a dynamic injected component:  1. 2.  Open the StarRating.vue component. In the   part of the component, we need to create a computed property with a new computed value called starComponent. This value will check whether the user has voted. If they haven't, it will return the StarRatingInput component; otherwise, it will return the StarRatingDisplay component:    import StarRatingInput from '. StarRatingInput.vue'; import StarRatingDisplay from '. StarRatingDisplay.vue';  export default {   name: 'StarRating',   components: { StarRatingDisplay, StarRatingInput },   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },     rating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },     votes: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },   },   data:    =>  {     rank: 0,     voted: false,   } ,   computed: {     starComponent   {       if  !this.voted  return StarRatingInput;       return StarRatingDisplay;  [ 184 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  3.  In the   part of the component, we will remove both of the existing components and replace them with a special component called  . This special component has a named attribute that you can point to anywhere that returns a valid Vue component. In our case, we will point to the computed starComponent property. We will take all the bind props that were defined from both of the other components and put them inside this new component, including the text that is placed in  :      },   },   methods: {     vote rank  {       this.rank = rank;       this.voted = true;     },   }, };        <component     :is="starComponent"     :max-rating="maxRating"     :rating="rating  rank"     :votes="votes"     @final-vote="vote"   >     Rate this Place        How it works... Using the Vue special   component, we declared what the component should render according to the rules set on the computed property.   Being a generic component, you always need to guarantee that everything will be there for each of the components that can be rendered. The best way to do this is by using the v- bind directive with the props and rules that need to be defined, but it's possible to define it directly on the component also, as it will be passed down as a prop.

Chapter 4  Creating a dependency injection component Accessing data directly from a child or a parent component without knowing whether they exist can be very dangerous.  In Vue, it's possible to make your component behavior like an interface and have a common and abstract function that won't change in the development process. The process of dependency injection is a common paradigm in the developing world and has been implemented in Vue also.  There are some pros and cons to using the internal Vue dependency injection, but it is always a good way to make sure that your children's components know what to expect from the parent component when developing it.  Getting ready The pre-requisite is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating a dynamic injected component' recipe.  [ 186 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  Now, follow these steps to create a dependency injection component:  1. 2.  Open the StarRating.vue component. In the   part of the component, add a new property called provide. In our case, we will just be adding a key-value to check whether the component is a child of the specific component. Create an object in the property with the starRating key and the true value:    import StarRatingInput from '. StarRatingInput.vue'; import StarRatingDisplay from '. StarRatingDisplay.vue';  export default {   name: 'StarRating',   components: { StarRatingDisplay, StarRatingInput },   provide: {     starRating: true,   },   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },     rating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },     votes: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },   },   data:    =>  {     rank: 0,     voted: false,   } ,   computed: {     starComponent   {       if  !this.voted  return StarRatingInput;       return StarRatingDisplay;     },   },   methods: {     vote rank  {  [ 187 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4        this.rank = rank;       this.voted = true;     },   }, };    3. 4.  Open the StarRatingDisplay.vue file. In the   part of the component, we will add a new property called inject. This property will receive an object with a key named starRating, and the value will be an object that will have a default   function. This function will log an error if this component is not a child of the StarRating component:    export default {   name: 'StarRatingDisplay',   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },     rating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },     votes: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },   },   inject: {     starRating: {       default   {         console.error 'StarRatingDisplay need to be a child of           StarRating' ;       },     },   },   methods: {     getStarName rate  {       if  rate <= this.rating  {         return 'star';       }  [ 188 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4        if  Math.fround  rate - this.rating   < 1  {         return 'star_half';       }       return 'star_border';     },   }, };    5. 6.  Open the StarRatingInput.vue file. In the   part of the component, we will add a new property called inject. This property will receive an object with a key named starRating, and the value will be an object that will have a default   function. This function will log an error if this component is not a child of the StarRating component:    export default {   name: 'StarRatingInput',   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },   },   inject: {     starRating: {       default   {         console.error 'StarRatingInput need to be a child of           StarRating' ;       },     },   },   data:    =>  {     rating: 0,   } ,   methods: {     updateRating value  {       this.rating = value;     },     emitFinalVote value  {       this.updateRating value ;       this.$emit 'final-vote', this.rating ;     },     getStarName rate  {       if  rate <= this.rating  {  [ 189 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4          return 'star';       }       if  Math.fround  rate - this.rating   < 1  {         return 'star_half';       }       return 'star_border';     },   }, };    How it works... At runtime, Vue will check for the injected property of starRating in the StarRatingDisplay and StarRatingInput components, and if the parent component does not provide this value, it will log an error on the console.  Using component injection is commonly used to maintain a way of a common interface between bounded components, such as a menu and an item. An item may need some function or data that is stored in the menu, or we may need to check whether it's a child of the menu.  The main downside of dependency injection is that there is no more reactivity on the shared element. Because of that, it's mostly used to share functions or check component links.

[ 190 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  Creating a component mixin There are times where you find yourself rewriting the same code over and over. However, there is a way to prevent this and make yourself far more productive.   You can use what is called a mixin, a special code import in Vue that joins code parts from outside your component to your current component.  Getting ready The pre-requisite is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in the recipe 'Creating Your First Project with Vue CLI' in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating a dependency injection component' recipe.  Let's follow these steps to create a component mixin:  1. 2.  Open the StarRating.vue component. In the   part, we need to extract the props property into a new file called starRatingDisplay.js that we need to create in the mixins folder. This new file will be our first mixin, and will look like this:  export default {   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },     rating: {       type: Number,  [ 191 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4        required: false,       default: 0,     },     votes: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },   }, };  3.  Back in the StarRating.vue component, we need to import this newly created file and add it to a new property called mixin:    import StarRatingInput from '. StarRatingInput.vue'; import StarRatingDisplay from '. StarRatingDisplay.vue'; import StarRatingDisplayMixin from '.. mixins starRatingDisplay';  export default {   name: 'StarRating',   components: { StarRatingDisplay, StarRatingInput },   mixins: [StarRatingDisplayMixin],   provide: {     starRating: true,   },   data:    =>  {     rank: 0,     voted: false,   } ,   computed: {     starComponent   {       if  !this.voted  return StarRatingInput;       return StarRatingDisplay;     },   },   methods: {     vote rank  {       this.rank = rank;       this.voted = true;     },   }, };    4.  Now, we will open the StarRatingDisplay.vue file.  [ 192 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  5.  In the   part, we will extract the inject property into a new file called starRatingChild.js, which will be created in the mixins folder. This will be our mixin for the inject property:  export default {   inject: {     starRating: {       default   {         console.error 'StarRatingDisplay need to be a child of            StarRating' ;       },     },   }, };  6.  Back in the StarRatingDisplay.vue file, in the   part, we will extract the methods property into a new file called starRatingName.js, which will be created in the mixins folder. This will be our mixin for the getStarName method:  export default {   methods: {     getStarName rate  {       if  rate <= this.rating  {         return 'star';       }       if  Math.fround  rate - this.rating   < 1  {         return 'star_half';       }       return 'star_border';     },   }, };  7.  Back in the StarRatingDisplay.vue file, we need to import those newly created files and add them to a new property called mixin:    import StarRatingDisplayMixin from '.. mixins starRatingDisplay'; import StarRatingNameMixin from '.. mixins starRatingName'; import StarRatingChildMixin from '.. mixins starRatingChild';  export default {   name: 'StarRatingDisplay',   mixins: [     StarRatingDisplayMixin,     StarRatingNameMixin,  [ 193 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  8. 9.  Open the StarRatingInput.vue file. In the   part, we remove the inject properties and extract the props property into a new file called starRatingBase.js, which will be created in the mixins folder. This will be our mixin for the props property:  10.  Back in the StarRatingInput.vue file, we need to rename the rating data property to rank, and in the getStarName method, we need to add a new constant that will receive either the rating props or the rank data. Finally, we need to import the starRatingChild mixin and the starRatingBase mixin:    import StarRatingBaseMixin from '.. mixins starRatingBase'; import StarRatingChildMixin from '.. mixins starRatingChild';      StarRatingChildMixin,   ], };    export default {   props: {     maxRating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 5,     },     rating: {       type: Number,       required: false,       default: 0,     },   }, };  export default {   name: 'StarRatingInput',   mixins: [     StarRatingBaseMixin,     StarRatingChildMixin,   ],   data:    =>  {     rank: 0,   } ,   methods: {     updateRating value  {  [ 194 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4        this.rank = value;     },     emitFinalVote value  {       this.updateRating value ;       this.$emit 'final-vote', this.rank ;     },     getStarName rate  {       const rating =  this.rating  this.rank ;       if  rate <= rating  {         return 'star';       }       if  Math.fround  rate - rating   < 1  {         return 'star_half';       }       return 'star_border';     },   }, };    How it works... Mixins work as an object merge, but do make sure you don't replace an already-existing property in your component with an imported one.   The order of the mixins properties is important as well, as they will be checked and imported as a for loop, so the last mixin won't change any properties from any of their ancestors.   Here, we took a lot of repeated parts of our code and split them into four different small JavaScript files that are easier to maintain and improve productivity without needing to rewrite code.

[ 195 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4  Lazy loading your components webpack and Vue were born to be together. When using webpack as the bundler for your Vue project, it's possible to make your components load when they are needed or asynchronously. This is commonly known as lazy loading.  Getting ready The pre-requisite is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating a component mixin' recipe.  Now, follow these steps to import your component with a lazy loading technique:  1. 2.  Open the App.vue file. In the   part of the component, we will take the imports at the top of the script and transform them into lazy load functions for each component:    export default {   name: 'App',   components: {     StarRating:    => import '. components StarRating.vue' ,     MaterialButton:    => import '. components MaterialButton.vue' ,     MaterialCardBox:    =>       import '. components MaterialCardBox.vue' ,   },   methods: {     resetVote   {  [ 196 ]   Components, Mixins, and Functional Components  Chapter 4        this.$refs.starRating.rank = 0;       this.$refs.starRating.voted = false;     },     forceVote   {       this.$refs.starRating.rank = 5;       this.$refs.starRating.voted = true;     },   }, };    How it works... When we declare a function that returns an import   function for each component, webpack knows that this import function will be code-splitting, and it will make the  component a new file on the bundle.  The import   function was introduced as a proposal by the TC39 for module loading syntax. The base functionality of this function is to load any module that is declared asynchronously, avoiding the need to place all the files on the first load.

[ 197 ]   5  Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Data is a part of everyday life nowadays. If it weren't for data, you wouldn't be reading this book or trying to learn more about Vue.  Knowing how to fetch and send your data inside an application is a requirement for a developer, not just an extra skill that's nice to have. The best way to learn it is by practicing it and finding out how it is done behind the scenes.  In this chapter, we will learn how to build our own API data manipulation with the Fetch API and the most popular API library in the web right now, axios.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client Creating a random cat image or GIF component Creating your local fake JSON API server with MirageJS Using axios as the new HTTP client Creating different axios instances Creating a request and response interceptor for axios Creating a CRUD interface with axios and Vuesax   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue CLI.  Attention, Windows users! You need to install an NPM package called windows-build-tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do this, open PowerShell as administrator and execute the following command: > npm install -g windows-build-tools  To install Vue CLI, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client The Fetch API is the child of the old XMLHttpRequest. It has an improved API and a new and powerful set of features completely based on Promises.  The Fetch API is both simple and based on a generic definition of two objects, Request, and Response, which allow it to be used everywhere in the browser. The browser Fetch API can be executed inside the window or the service worker as well. There is no limitation on the usage of this API.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create a wrapper around the Fetch API to make the API calls more simple.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 199 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests How to do it...

Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys  ❯ default  babel, eslint    Manually select features ‌  Creating the wrapper First, we need to create a new API wrapper to be used in this recipe. This will be the main file we will use on all the HTTP methods.  Let's create the base wrapper by following these steps:  1. 2.  Create a new file called baseFetch.js in the src http folder. We will create an asynchronous function that will receive as an argument the three variables of url, method, and options. This will be a currying function, which the second function will receive as an argument, type:  export default async  url, method, options = {}  => {   let httpRequest;   if  method.toUpperCase   === 'GET'  {     httpRequest = await fetch url, {       cache: 'reload',       ...options,     } ;   } else {     httpRequest = fetch url, {       method: method.toUpperCase  ,       cache: 'reload',       ...options,     } ;   }  [ 200 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5    return  type  => {     switch  type.toLocaleLowerCase    {       case 'json':         return httpRequest.json  ;       case 'blob':         return httpRequest.blob  ;       case 'text':         return httpRequest.text  ;       case 'formdata':         return httpRequest.formData  ;       default:         return httpRequest.arrayBuffer  ;     }   }; };  Creating the API methods Now we need to make our HTTP method function. These functions will use the wrapper to execute the browser Fetch API and return the response.  Follow these steps to create each one of the API method calls:  1. 2.  Let's create a new file called fetchApi.js in the src http folder. We need to import the baseHttp from the file we created in the first step:  import baseHttp from '. baseFetch';  Now in the following parts, we will create each one of the HTTP methods that will be available in our wrapper.  GET method function In these steps, we are going to create the HTTP GET method. Follow each of the following instructions to create the getHttp function:  1. 2.  Create a constant called getHttp. Define that constant as an asynchronous function that receives three arguments, url, type, and options. The type argument will have the default value of 'json'.  [ 201 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  3.  In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the url that we received, 'get' as the second argument, the options as the third argument, and immediately execute the function with the type argument we received:  export const getHttp = async  url, type = 'json', options  =>  await    baseHttp url, 'get', options   type ;  POST method function In this part, we are creating the HTTP POST method. Follow these steps to create the postHttp function:  1. 2.  3.  Create a constant called postHttp. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the default value of 'json'. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the url argument that we received, and 'post' as the second argument. In the third argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with the type argument we received. The body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript object. If this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a FormData object:  export const postHttp = async     url,   body,   type = 'json',   options,   =>  await baseHttp url,   'post',   {     body,     ...options,   }   type ;  [ 202 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests PUT method function Now we are creating an HTTP PUT method. Use the following steps to create the putHttp function:  Chapter 5  1. 2.  3.  Create a constant called putHttp. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the default value of 'json'. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the url that we received, and 'put' as the second argument. In the third argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with the type argument we received. body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript object, but if this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a FormData object:  export const putHttp = async     url,   body,   type = 'json',   options,   =>  await baseHttp url,   'put',   {     body,     ...options,   }   type ;  PATCH method function It's time to create an HTTP PATCH method. Follow these steps to create the patchHttp function:  1. 2.  Create a constant called patchHttp. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the default value of 'json'.  [ 203 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  3.  In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the url that we received, and 'patch' as the second argument. In the third argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with the type we received. body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript object, but if this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a FormData object:  export const patchHttp = async     url,   body,   type = 'json',   options,   =>  await baseHttp url,   'patch',   {     body,     ...options,   }   type ;  UPDATE method function In this section, we are creating an HTTP UPDATE method. Follow these steps to create the updateHttp function:  1. 2.  3.  Create a constant called updateHttp. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the default value of 'json'. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the url that we received, and 'update' as the second argument. In the third argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with the type we received. body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript object, but if this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a FormData object:  export const updateHttp = async     url,   body,   type = 'json',   options,   =>  await baseHttp url,  [ 204 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5    'update',   {     body,     ...options,   }   type ;  DELETE method function In this final step, we will create a DELETE HTTP method. Follow these steps to create the deleteHttp function:  1. 2.  3.  Create a constant called deleteHttp. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the default value of 'json'. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the url that we received, and 'delete' as the second argument. In the third argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with the type we received. body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript object, but if this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a FormData object:  export const deleteHttp = async     url,   body,   type = 'json',   options,   =>  await baseHttp url,   'delete',   {     body,     ...options,   }   type ;  How it works... In this recipe, we created a wrapper for the Fetch API that is presented on the window element. This wrapper consists of a currying and closure function, where the first function  receives the URL data, method, and options for the Fetch API, and the resulting function is the Fetch API response translator.  [ 205 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  In the wrapper, the first part of the function will create our fetch request. There, we need to check whether it's a GET method, so we just need to execute it with the url parameter and omit the others. The second part of the function is responsible for the conversion of the fetch response. It will switch between the type parameter and execute the retrieving function according to the correct one.  To receive the final data for your request, you always need to call the response translator after the request, as in the following example:  getHttp 'https:  jsonplaceholder.typicode.com todos 1',           'json' .then  response  => { console.log response  ; }  This will get the data from the URL and transform the response into a JSON JavaScript object.  The second part we made was the methods translator. We made functions for each one of the REST verbs to be used more easily. The GET verb doesn't have the ability to pass any body but all the others are capable of passing a body in the request.

[ 206 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  Creating a random cat image or GIF component It's common knowledge that the internet is made of many GIFs and videos of cats. I'm sure that if we took down all cat-related content, we would have a web blackout.  The best way to understand more about the Fetch API and how it can be used inside a component is to make a random cat image or GIF component.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we used in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client' recipe, or we can start a new one.  To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create http-project  The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the project.

You can achieve the same results with simple HTML elements.  Chapter 5  We will divide the creation of this component in three steps:  ,  , and  .  Single ﬁle component   section Follow these steps to create the   section of the single file component:  1.  2.  Create a new file called RandomCat.vue in the src components folder and open it. Import the getHttp function from the fetchApi wrapper we made in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client' recipe:  import { getHttp } from '.. http fetchApi';  3.  Asynchronously import the MaterialButton and MaterialCardBox components in the component property:  components: {   MaterialButton:    => import '. MaterialButton.vue' ,   MaterialCardBox:    => import '. MaterialCardBox.vue' , },  4.  In the data property, we need to create a new data value named kittyImage, which will be by default an empty string:  data:    =>  {   kittyImage: '', } ,  5.  In the methods property, we need to create the getImage method, which will fetch the image as a Blob and return it as a URL.createObjectURL. We also need to create the newCatImage method that will fetch a new still image of a cat and the newCatGif method that will fetch a new cat GIF:  methods: {     async getImage url  {       return URL.createObjectURL await getHttp url, 'blob'  ;     },     async newCatImage   {  [ 208 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5        this.kittyImage = await           this.getImage 'https:  cataas.com cat' ;     },     async newCatGif   {       this.kittyImage = await           this.getImage 'https:  cataas.com cat gif' ;     },   },  6.  In the beforeMount life cycle hook, we need to make it asynchronous and execute the newCatImage method:  async beforeMount   {     await this.newCatImage  ;   },  Single ﬁle component   section Follow these steps to create the   section of the single file component:  1.  First, we need to add the MaterialCardBox component with a header and sub- header, activate the media and action sections, and create the   named slots for media and action:  <MaterialCardBox   header="Cat as a Service"   sub-header="Random Cat Image"   show-media   show-actions >   <template     v-slot:media>                [ 209 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  2.  In the   named slot for media, we need to add an   element that will receive a URI Blob, which will be displayed when there is any data in the kittyImage variable, or it will display a loading icon:  <img   v-if="kittyImage"   alt="Meow!"   :src="kittyImage"   style="width: 300px;" >              cached          3.  At the   named slot for action, we will create two buttons, one for fetching cat images and another for fetching cat GIFs, and both will have an event listener on the @click directive that calls a function that fetches the corresponding image:  <MaterialButton   background-color="4ba3c7"   text-color="fff"   @click="newCatImage" >         pets     Cat Image   <MaterialButton   background-color="005b9f"   text-color="fff"   @click="newCatGif" >         pets     Cat GIF    [ 210 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Single ﬁle component   section In the   part of the component, we need to set the body font-size for the CSS style calculation based on rem and em:  Chapter 5      body {     font-size: 14px;   }    Getting up and running with your new component Follow these steps to add your component to your Vue application:  1. 2.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the components property, asynchronously import the RandomCat.vue component:    export default {   name: 'App',   components: {     RandomCat:    => import '. components RandomCat' ,   }, };    3.  In the   section of the file, declare the imported component:                     To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  [ 211 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  How it works...

[ 212 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  Creating your fake JSON API server with MirageJS Faking data for testing, developing, or designing is always a problem. You need to have a big JSON or make a custom server to handle any data changes when presenting the application at the development stage.  There is now a way to help developers and UI designers achieve this without needing to code an external server – a new tool called MirageJS, a server emulator that runs on the browser.  In this recipe, we will learn how to use the MirageJS as a mock server and execute HTTP requests on it.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we did in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client' recipe, or we can start a new one.

You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue, and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys  ❯ default  babel, eslint    Manually select features ‌  Creating the mock server In this recipe, we will be using the getHttp function from the fetchApi wrapper we made in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client' recipe.  Work through the next steps and sections to create your MirageJS mock server:  Install the MirageJS server to your packages. You need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install --save miragejs  The version used in this recipe was 0.1.32. Watch for any changes to MirageJS, as there are no current LTS versions of the library yet.  Now in the following sections, we will create each one of the HTTP methods that will be mocked by the MirageJS server.  Creating the mock database In this section, we will create a MirageJS database that will be used to store the temporary data. Follow these steps to create it:  1.  Create a new file called db.js file in the src server folder for the initial loaded data.  [ 214 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  2.  We need to make a JavaScript object the default export for this file, containing the initial data that we want the server to have:  export default {   users: [     {       name: 'Heitor Ramon Ribeiro',       email: 'heitor@example.com',       age: 31,       country: 'Brazil',       active: true,     },   ], };  Creating the GET route function In this section, we are going to create the HTTP GET method that will be mocked by the MirageJS server. Follow these steps to create it:  1.  2.  For the GET methods, we need to create a new file called get.js in the src server folder. For this recipe, we will make a generic getFrom function that receives a key as an argument and returns a function. This returned function returns a direct point to the local database with the indicated key:  export const getFrom = key =>  { db }  => db[key];  export default {   getFrom, };  Creating the POST route function In this section, we are going to create the HTTP POST method, that will be mocked by the MirageJS server. Follow these steps to create it:  1.  For the POST methods, we need to create a new file called post.js in the src server folder.  [ 215 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  2.  For this recipe, we will make a generic postFrom function that receives a key as an argument and returns a function. This returned function will parse the data property of the HTTP request body and returns an internal function of the server schema that inserts the data inside the database. Using the key argument, the schema knows which table we are handling:  export const postFrom = key =>  schema, request  => {   const { data } = typeof request.requestBody === 'string'     ? JSON.parse request.requestBody      : request.requestBody;    return schema.db[key].insert data ; };  export default {   postFrom, };  Creating the PATCH route function In this section, we are going to create the HTTP PATCH method that will be mocked by the MirageJS server. Follow these steps to create it:  1.  2.  For the PATCH methods, we need to create a new file called patch.js in the src server folder. For this recipe, we will make a generic patchFrom function that receives a key as an argument and returns a function. This returned function will parse the data property of the HTTP request body and returns an internal function of the server schema that updates a specific object with the id property that was passed along with the data. Using the key argument, the schema knows which table we are handling:  export const patchFrom = key =>  schema, request  => {   const { data } = typeof request.requestBody === 'string'     ? JSON.parse request.requestBody      : request.requestBody;    return schema.db[key].update data.id, data ; };  export default {   patchFrom, };  [ 216 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Creating the DELETE route function In this section, we are going to create the HTTP DELETE method that will be mocked by the MirageJS server. Follow these steps to create it:  Chapter 5  1.  2.  For the DELETE methods, we need to create a new file called delete.js in the src server folder. For this recipe, we will make a generic patchFrom function that receives a key as an argument and returns a function. This returned function will parse the data property of the HTTP request body and return an internal function of the server schema that deletes a specific object with the id property, which was passed to the server via the route REST parameter. Using the key argument, the schema knows which table we are handling:  export const deleteFrom = key =>  schema, request  =>    schema.db[key].remove request.params.id ;  export default {   deleteFrom, };  Creating the server In this section, we are going to create the MirageJS server and the routes that will be available. Follow these steps to create the server:  1. 2.  Create a new file called server.js inside the src server folder. Next, we need to import the Server class, the baseData, and the router methods:  import { Server } from 'miragejs'; import baseData from '. db'; import { getFrom } from '. get'; import { postFrom } from '. post'; import { patchFrom } from '. patch'; import { deleteFrom } from '. delete';  [ 217 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  3.  Create a global variable to the window scope, called server, and set this variable as a new execution of the Server class:  window.server = new Server {} ;  4.  In the Server class construction options, add a new property called seeds. This property is a function that receives the server  srv  as an argument and executes the srv.db.loadData function passing the baseDate as a parameter:  seeds srv  {   srv.db.loadData { ...baseData } ; },  5.  Now we need to add in the same construction options to a new property called routes, which will create the mock server routes. This property is a function and on the function body, we will need to set the namespace of the mock server and the delay in milliseconds within which the server will respond. There will be four routes. For the Create route, we will make a new route called  users that listen to the POST method. For the Read route, we will make a new route called  users that listen to the GET method. For the Update route, we will make a new route called  users :id that listens to the PATCH method, and finally, for the Delete route, we will make a new route called  users that listen to the DELETE method:  routes   {     this.namespace = 'api';      this.timing = 750;      this.get ' users', getFrom 'users'  ;      this.post ' users', postFrom 'users'  ;      this.patch ' users :id', patchFrom 'users'  ;      this.delete ' users :id', deleteFrom 'users'  ;   },  [ 218 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Adding to the application In this section, we will add the MirageJS server to the Vue application. Follow these steps to make the server available to your Vue application:  Chapter 5  1. 2.  Open the main.js file in the src folder. We need to declare the server as the first imported declaration, so it's available on the initial loading of the application:  import '. server server'; import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue';  Vue.config.productionTip = false;  new Vue {   render: h => h App , } .$mount 'app' ;  Creating the component Now that we have our server, we need to test it. To do so, we will create a simple application that will run each of the HTTP methods and show the results of each call.  In the following parts, we will create a simple Vue application.  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these steps to create it:  1. 2.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. Import the getHttp, postHttp, patchHttp, and deleteHTTP methods from the fetchHttp wrapper that we made in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client' recipe:  import {   getHttp,   postHttp,   patchHttp,   deleteHttp, } from '. http fetchApi';  [ 219 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  3.  In the data property, we need to create three new properties to be used, response, userData, and userId:  4.  In the methods property, we need to create four new methods, getAllUsers, createUser, updateUser, and deleteUser:  data:    =>  {     response: undefined,     userData: '',     userId: undefined,   } ,  methods: {   async getAllUsers   {   },   async createUser   {   },   async updateUser   {   },   async deleteUser   {   }, },  5.  In the getAllUsers method, we will set the response data property as the result of the getHttp function of the api users route:  async getAllUsers   {   this.response = await getHttp `${window.location.href}api users` ; },  6.  In the createUser method, we will receive a data argument, which will be an object that we will pass to the postHttp on the api users route, and after that, we will execute the getAllUsers method:  async createUser data  {   await postHttp `${window.location.href}api users`, { data } ;   await this.getAllUsers  ; },  [ 220 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  7.  For the updateUser method, we will receive a data argument, which will be an object that we will pass to the patchHttp on the api users :id route, using the id property on the object as the :id on the route. After that, we will execute the getAllUsers method:  async updateUser data  {   await patchHttp `${window.location.href}api users ${data.id}`,      { data } ;   await this.getAllUsers  ; },  8.  Finally, on the deleteUser method, we receive the user id as the argument, which is a number, then we pass it to the deleteHttp on the api users :id route, using the ID as :id. After that, we execute the getAllUsers method:  async deleteUser id  {   await deleteHttp `${window.location.href}api users ${id}`, {},      'text' ;   await this.getAllUsers  ; },  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these steps to create it:  1.  At the top of the template, we need to add the response property, wrapped in an   HTML element:   Response   {{ response }}   [ 221 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  2.  For the creation and updating of a user, we need to create a textarea HTML input with a v-model directive bound to the userData property:      Create   Update User      User JSON:  <textarea  id="userData"  v-model="userData"  rows="10"  cols="40"  style="display: block;"  >     3.  To send this data, we need to create two buttons, both having an event listener bound on the click event with the @click directive targeting the createUser and updateUser respectively, and passing the userData in the execution:  <button   style="margin: 20px;"   @click="createUser JSON.parse userData  " >   Create User   <button   style="margin: 20px;"   @click="updateUser JSON.parse userData  " >   Update User    4.  To execute the DELETE method, we need to create an input HTML element of type number with a v-model directive bound to the userId property:    Delete User       User Id:      [ 222 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  5.  Finally, to execute this action we need to create a button that will have an event listener bound on the click event with the @click directive, targeting the deleteUser method and passing the userId property on the execution:  <button   style="margin: 20px;"   @click="deleteUser userId " >   Delete User    To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  [ 223 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests How it works... MirageJS works like an interceptor of every HTTP request that happens on the application. The server intercepts all XHR  XMLHttpRequest  executions on the browsers and checks for the route to see whether it matches any one of the routes created on server creation. If it matches, the server will execute the function accordingly on the respective route.  Chapter 5  Working as a simple REST server with basic CRUD functions, the server has a schema-like database structure that helps in the process of making a virtual database for storing the data.

Using axios as the new HTTP client When you need a library for HTTP requests, there is no doubt that axios is the one you should go to. Used by more than 1.5 million open-source projects and countless closed ones, this library is the king of HTTP libraries.  It's built to work with most browsers and provides one of the most complete sets of options out there – you can customize everything in your request.

In the deleteUser method, we can just pass the URL as the parameter:  async deleteUser id  {   await deleteHttp `${window.location.href}api users ${id}` ;   await this.getAllUsers  ;  },  [ 229 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  How it works... When we made the wrapper for the Fetch API, we used a technique of abstracting the API into another interface, which made it possible to change from the Fetch API to the axios library. By doing this we were able to improve the methods and simplify how the functions are called and handled. For example, the GET method can now receive a new argument called params, which are objects of URL query parameters that will be automatically injected into the URL.  We also had to change the way that the responses were interpreted because axios have a more robust and complete response object than the Fetch API, which returns just the fetched response itself.

Creating different axios instances When using axios, you can have multiple instances of it running with none of them interfering with each other. For example, you have an instance pointing to a user API that is on version 1 and another pointing to the payment API that is on version 2, both sharing the same namespace.  Here, we are going to learn how to create various axios instances, so you are able to work with as many API namespaces as you want without problems or interference.

We need to create a new factory function called createAxios to generate a new axios instance each time it's executed:  export function createAxios options = {}  {   return axios.create {     ...options,   } ; }  3.  Now we need to create the localApi constant, the value of which will be the result of the execution of the createAxios factory:  const localApi = createAxios  ;  4.  For the JSONPlaceHolder we will create a constant that will be exported, named jsonPlaceholderApi, the value of which will be the execution of the createAxios factory. We will also pass an object as an argument with the baseURL property defined:  export const jsonPlaceholderApi = createAxios {   baseURL: 'https:  jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ', } ;  5.  In the export default function, we need to change from axios to localApi:  export default async  url, method, options = {}  => localApi {   method: method.toUpperCase  ,   url,   ...options, } ;  [ 232 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Changing the HTTP methods function In this part, we will change how the HTTP methods will work with the new axios instances. Follow the instructions to do it correctly:  Chapter 5  1. 2.  3.  Open the fetchApi.js file in the src http folder. We will import the jsonPlaceholderApi function from baseFetch as an extra imported value:  import baseHttp, { jsonPlaceholderApi } from '. baseFetch';  We need to create a new constant called getTodos that will be exported. This constant will be a function that will receive a userId as a parameter and return the GET function from axios, with the userId parameter we just received, inside a configuration object in a property called params:  export const getTodos = async userId => jsonPlaceholderApi.get 'todos',   {     params: {       userId,     },   } ;  Changing the MirageJS server In this part, we will change how the MirageJS server works with the new axios instance that was created. Follow the instructions to do it correctly:  1. 2.  Open the server.js file in the src server folder. On the routes property in the constructor object, we need to add a passthrough declaration, which will indicate to the MirageJS that all the calls to that URL won't be intercepted:  import { Server } from 'miragejs'; import baseData from '. db'; import { getFrom } from '. get'; import { postFrom } from '. post'; import { patchFrom } from '. patch'; import { deleteFrom } from '. delete';  window.server = new Server {   seeds srv  {     srv.db.loadData { ...baseData } ;   },  [ 233 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5    routes   {     this.passthrough  ;     this.passthrough 'https:  jsonplaceholder.typicode.com **' ;      this.namespace = 'api';      this.timing = 750;      this.get ' users', getFrom 'users'  ;      this.post ' users', postFrom 'users'  ;      this.patch ' users :id', patchFrom 'users'  ;      this.delete ' users :id', deleteFrom 'users'  ;   }, } ;  Changing the component After the changes in the wrapper functions, the MirageJS server methods, and the HTTP methods, we need to change the component to the new library that was implemented.  In the following parts, we will change the component to match the new library that was implemented.  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will change the   section of the single file component. Follow these steps to do it:  1. 2.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. We need to import the new getTodos function as follows:  import {   getHttp,   postHttp,   patchHttp,   deleteHttp,   getTodos, } from '. http fetchApi';  [ 234 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  3.  In the data property of the Vue object, we need to create a new property called userTodo, with the default value of an empty array:  data:    =>  {   response: undefined,   userData: '',   userId: undefined,   userTodo: [], } ,  4.  In the methods property, we need to create a new method called getUserTodo that receives the userId argument. This method will fetch the list of to-do items of the user and will attribute the response to the userTodo property:  async getUserTodo userId  {   this.userTodo = await getTodos userId ; },  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will change the   section of the single file component. Follow these steps to do it:  1. 2.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. At the bottom of the template, we need to create a new input HTML element, with the v-model directive bound to the userId property:    Get User ToDos       User Id:        3.  To fetch the list of items, we need to create a button with an event listener bound on the click event with the @click directive, targeting the getUserTodo, and passing the userId in the execution:  <button   style="margin: 20px;"   @click="getUserTodo userId " >   Fetch Data    [ 235 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  [ 236 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests How it works... When we create a new instance of axios, a new object is created, and new configurations, headers, interceptors, and manipulators are defined. This happens because axios declares the create functions as the same as new Class. It's the same interface but different objects.  Chapter 5  Using this possibility, we were able to create two connection drivers, one for the local API and another for the JSONPlaceHolder API, which has a different baseURL.  Because of MirageJS server integration, all the HTTP requests are intercepted by MirageJS, so we needed to add a directive in the router constructor that indicates the routes that MirageJS won't intercept.

Creating a request and response interceptor for axios Using axios as the main HTTP manipulator in our application allows us to use request and response interceptors. Those are used to manipulate the data before sending it to the server or when receiving the data, manipulating it before sending it back to the JavaScript code.  The most common way an interceptor is used is in JWT token validation and refreshing the requests that receive a specific error or API error manipulation.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create a request interceptor to check the POST, PATCH, and DELETE methods and a response error manipulator.  [ 237 ]   Chapter 5  Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we made in the 'Creating different axios instances' recipe, or we can start a new one.  To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create http-project  The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue, and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys  ❯ default  babel, eslint    Manually select features ‌  Creating the interceptor In the following steps, we will create an axios interceptor that will work as a middleware. Follow the instructions do it correctly:  1.  Install the Sweet Alert package. To do this you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install --save sweetalert2  2.  Create a new file called interceptors.js in the src http folder and open it.  [ 238 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  3.  Then, we import the Sweet Alert package:  import Swal from 'sweetalert2';  4.  We need to create a constant with an array of the POST methods that will be intercepted:  const postMethods = ['post', 'patch'];  5.  We need to create a function named requestInterceptor and export it. This function will receive one argument, config, which is an axios configuration object. We need to check whether the request method is included in the array we created earlier and whether the data property of the data body has an id property. If any of the checks didn't pass, we will throw an Error, otherwise, we will return config:  export function requestInterceptor config  {   if       postMethods.includes config.method.toLocaleLowerCase    &&     Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call 'id', config.data.data  &&       !config.data.data.id      {       throw new Error 'You need to pass an ID for this request' ;     }   return config; }  6.  For the response interceptor, we need to create a new function called responseInterceptor that returns the response, as we won't change anything in this interceptor:  export function responseInterceptor response  {   return response; }  7.  For catching the error, we need to create an errorInterceptor function, which will be exported. This function receives an error as an argument and will display a sweetalert2 alert error message and return a Promise.reject with the error:  export function errorInterceptor error  {   Swal.fire {     type: 'error',     title: 'Error!',     text: error.message,  [ 239 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5    } ;    return Promise.reject error ; }  Adding the interceptors to the HTTP methods functions In the following steps, we will add the axios interceptor to the HTTP method functions. Follow these steps to do it correctly:  1. 2.  Open the baseFetch.js file in the src http folder. We need to import the three interceptors we just created:  import {   errorInterceptor,   requestInterceptor,   responseInterceptor, } from '. interceptors';  3.  After the creation of the localApi instance, we declare the use of the request and response interceptor:  localApi.interceptors   .request.use requestInterceptor, errorInterceptor ;  localApi.interceptors   .response.use responseInterceptor, errorInterceptor ;  4.  After the creation of the jsonPlaceholderApi instance, we declare the use of the request and response interceptor:  jsonPlaceholderApi.interceptors   .request.use requestInterceptor, errorInterceptor ;  jsonPlaceholderApi.interceptors   .response.use responseInterceptor, errorInterceptor ;  How it works... Each request that axios do passes through each of any one of the interceptors in the set. The same thing happens for the response. If any error is thrown on the interceptor, it will automatically be passed to the error manipulator, so the request won't be executed at all, or the response will be sent to the JavaScript code as an error.  [ 240 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  We checked each request that was done for the POST, PATCH, and DELETE method to see if there was an id property in the body data. If there wasn't, we threw an error to the user, saying that they need to pass an ID for the request.  See also You can find more information about Sweet Alert 2 at https: ​ ​sweetalert2.​github.​io.

Creating a CRUD interface with Axios and Vuesax When dealing with data, there is something that we will always need to do: a CRUD process. Regardless of what kind of application you are developing, a CRUD interface is needed in order to input and manipulate any data on the server, the administrator panel, the backend of your application, or even the client side.  Here, we will learn how to create a simple CRUD interface using the Vuesax framework for the UI and axios for the HTTP request.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 241 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests How to do it...

Follow these instructions to do it correctly:  1.  Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install --save vuesax material-icons  2. 3.  Create a file called style.css in the src folder and open it. Import the vuesax, material-icon, and Open Sans font stylesheets:  @import url 'https:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Open+Sans:300,300i,400 ,400i,600,600i,700,700i,800,     800i&display=swap' ; @import url '~vuesax dist vuesax.css' ; @import url '~material-icons iconfont material-icons.css' ;  * {   font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; }  [ 242 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  4. 5.  Open the main.js file in the src folder. Import the style.css file and Vuesax. After that, you need to inform Vue to use Vuesax:  import '. server server'; import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import Vuesax from 'vuesax'; import '. style.css';  Vue.use Vuesax ;  Vue.config.productionTip = false;  new Vue {   render: h => h App , } .$mount 'app' ;  Creating the component routing We will continue the recipe in five parts: List, Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Our application will be a dynamic component application, so we will create five components, one for each part. Those components will be like our pages.  First, we need to change App.vue to be our main route manager and create a mixin for changing the component.  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these  instructions to create the component correctly:  1. 2.  Open App.vue in the src folder. Import each one of the components that will be created here:  import List from '. components list'; import Create from '. components create'; import View from '. components view'; import Update from '. components update';  [ 243 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  3.  In the data property, create two new values: componentIs with a default value of 'list', and userId with a default value of 0:  4.  We need to add a new property to the Vue object, called provide. This property will be a function, so the provided values to the components can be reactive:  data:    =>  {   componentIs: 'list',   userId: 0, } ,  provide    {   const base = {};    Object.defineProperty base, 'userId', {     enumerable: true,     get:    => Number this.userId ,   } ;    return base; },  5.  In the computed properties, we need to create a new property called component. This will be a switch case that will return our component, based on the componentIs property:  computed: {   component   {     switch  this.componentIs  {       case 'list':         return List;       case 'create':         return Create;       case 'view':         return View;       case 'edit':         return Update;       default:         return undefined;     }   } },  [ 244 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  6.  Finally, in the methods, we need to create a changeComponent method that will update the current component to a new one:  methods: {   changeComponent payload  {     this.componentIs = payload.component;     this.userId = Number payload.userId ;   }, },  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  1.  In the divapp HTML element, we need to add a vs-row component:  2.  In the vs-row component, we need to add a vs-col component with the following attributes: vs-type defined as flex, vs-justify defined as left, vs-align defined as left, and vs-w defined as 12:              <vs-col   vs-type="flex"   vs-justify="left"   vs-align="left"   vs-w="12">    3.  Finally, inside the vs-col component, we will add a dynamic component that has an is attribute to the computed property component and point the event listener at the "change-component" event that will execute the changeComponent method:  <component  :is="component"  @change-component="changeComponent"  >  [ 245 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Creating the route mixin In this part, we will create the component mixin to be re-used in other components. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  Chapter 5  1.  2.  Create a new file called changeComponent.js in the src mixin folder and open it. This mixin will have a method called changeComponent, which will emit a 'change-component' event with the name of the new component that needs to be rendered, and the userId:  export default {   methods: {     changeComponent component, userId = 0  {       this.$emit 'change-component', { component, userId } ;     },   } }  Creating the list component The list component will be the index component. It will list the users in the application and have all the links for the other CRUD actions.  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  1. 2.  Create a new file called list.vue in the src components folder and open it. Import the getHttp and deleteHttp from fetchApi and the changeComponent mixin:  import {     getHttp,     deleteHttp,   } from '.. http fetchApi';   import changeComponent from '.. mixin changeComponent';  [ 246 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  3.  In the component mixins property, we need to add the imported changeComponent mixin:  mixins: [changeComponent],  4.  In the data property of the component, we add a new property named userList, with a default empty array:  data:    =>  {   userList: [], } ,  5.  For the methods, we create getAllUsers and deleteUsers methods. In the getAllUsers method, we fetch the user lists and set the userList value as the response from the getHttp function execution. The deleteUser method will execute the deleteHttp function, and then execute the getAllUsers method:  methods: {   async getAllUsers   {     const { data } = await getHttp `${window.location.href}api users` ;     this.userList = data;   },   async deleteUser id  {     await deleteHttp `${window.location.href}api users ${id}` ;     await this.getAllUsers  ;   }, }  6.  Lastly, we make the beforeMount life cycle hook asynchronous, calling the getAllUsers method:  async beforeMount   {   await this.getAllUsers  ; },  [ 247 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  Chapter 5  1.  Create a vs-card component with the style attribute defined as margin: 20px:  2.  Inside the vs-card component, create a dynamic   named slot for header, with an   tag and your title:  3.  After that, create a vs-row component with a vs-col component inside of it, with the following attributes: vs-type defined as flex, vs-justify defined as left, vs-align defined as left, and vs-w defined as 12:  <vs-card     style="margin: 20px;"   >              Users            <vs-col     vs-type="flex"     vs-justify="left"     vs-align="left"     vs-w="12">        [ 248 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  4.  Inside the vs-col component, we need to create a vs-table component. This component will have the data attribute pointed to the userList variable, and will have the search, stripe, and pagination attributes defined as true. The max-items attribute will be defined as 10 and the style attribute will have the value of width: 100%; padding: 20px;:  <vs-table   :data="userList"   search   stripe   pagination   max-items="10"   style="width: 100%; padding: 20px;" >   5.  For the table header, we need to create a dynamic   named slot thead, and create for each column a vs-th component with the sort-key attribute defined as the respective object key property and the display as the  name you want:                         Name             Email             Country             Phone             Birthday             Actions        [ 249 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  6.  For the table body, we need to create a dynamic   with a slot- scope attribute defined as the data property. Inside this   we need to create a vs-tr component that will iterate the data property and have a vs-td component for each column that you set on the head of the table. Each vs-td component has a data property set to the respective column data object property, and the content will be the same data rendered. The final column that is the actions column will have three buttons, one for Read, another for Update, and the last for Delete. The Read button will have an event listener on the "click" event pointing to the changeComponent, and the same goes for the Update button. The Delete button "click" event listener will be pointing to the deleteUser method:                    {{data[index].id}}                   {{data[index].name}}                             {{data[index].email}}                           {{data[index].country}}                   {{data[index].phone}}                   {{data[index].birthday}}                   <vs-button         color="primary"         type="filled"         icon="remove_red_eye"         size="small"         @click="changeComponent 'view', data[index].id "        >       <vs-button         color="success"         type="filled"         icon="edit"  [ 250 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5          size="small"         @click="changeComponent 'edit', data[index].id "        >       <vs-button         color="danger"         type="filled"         icon="delete"         size="small"         @click="deleteUser data[index].id "        >              7.  Finally, in the card footer, we need to create a dynamic   named slot for footer. Inside this   we will add a vs-row component with the vs-justify attribute defined as flex-start and insert a vs-button with the color attribute defined as primary, type defined as filled, icon defined as fiber_new, and size defined as small. The @click event listener will target the changeComponent method with the parameters 'create' and 0:            <vs-button       color="primary"       type="filled"       icon="fiber_new"       size="small"       @click="changeComponent 'create', 0 "     >       Create User              [ 251 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  Chapter 5  1.  Create a declaration of margin to the vs-button component class:      .vs-button {     margin-left: 5px;   }    2.  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  Creating a generic user form component In the following parts, we will create a generic user form component that will be used by other components. This component is considered generic because it is a component that can be used by anyone.  [ 252 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these  instructions to create the component correctly:  Chapter 5  1.  2.  Create a new file called userForm.vue in the src components folder and open it. In the props Vue property, create two new properties called value and disabled, both being objects and having the three properties of type, required, and default. For the value property, the type will be Object, required will be false, and default will be a factory returning an object. For the disabled property, the type will be Boolean, required will be false, and the default will also be false:  props: {   value: {     type: Object,     required: false,     default:    => {     },   },   disabled: {     type: Boolean,     required: false,     default: false,   } },  data:    =>  {   tmpForm: {}, } ,  3.  In the data property, we need to add a new value of tmpForm, with the default value of an empty object:  4.  In the Vue watch property, we need to create the handler for the tmpForm and the value. For the tmpForm watcher, we will add a handler function that will emit an 'input' event on each change with the new value, and add the deep property to true. Finally, on the value watcher, we will add a handler function that will set the value of the tmpForm as the new value. We also need to define the deep and immediate properties as true:  watch: {   tmpForm: {     handler value  {  [ 253 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5        this.$emit 'input', value ;     },     deep: true,   },   value: {     handler value  {       this.tmpForm = value;     },     deep: true,     immediate: true,   } },  When using watchers, declaring the deep property makes the watcher checks for deep changes on arrays or objects, and the immediate property executes the watcher as soon as the component is created.  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  1.  For the inputs wrapper, we need to create a vs-row component. Inside the vs- row component, we will create each input for our user form:      2.  For the name input, we need to create a vs-col component, with the attributes of vs-type defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-align defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as '6'. Inside of the vs-col component, we need to create a vs-input component, with the v-model directive bound to tmpForm.name, the attributes of disabled bound to the disabled props, label defined as 'Name', placeholder defined as 'User Name', and class defined as 'inputMargin full-width':  <vs-col   vs-type="flex"   vs-justify="left"   vs-align="left"   vs-w="6">   <vs-input     v-model="tmpForm.name"     :disabled="disabled"     label="Name"  [ 254 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5      placeholder="User Name"     class="inputMargin full-width"    >    3.  For the email input, we need to create a vs-col component, with the attributes of vs-type defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-align defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as '6'.

The CRUD interface that we created works like a router application, with three routes, the index or list, the view, and the edit route. Each route has its own screen and components, with separated logic functions.  We created an abstract UserForm component that was used on the View and Update components. This abstract component can be used in many other components, as it does not require any base logic to work; it's like an input but made of several inputs.  [ 269 ]   Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests  Chapter 5  Using the provide inject API of Vue, we were able to pass the userId to each of the components in an observable way, which means that when the variable is updated, the component receives the updated variable. This is not achievable using the normal Vue API, so we had to use the Object.defineProperty and use the provide property as a factory function to return the final object.

[ 270 ]   6  Managing Routes with vue- router  One of the main parts of your application is router management. Here, it is possible to bring together infinite component combinations in a single place.  A router is capable of coordinating component rendering and dictating where the application should be, depending on the URL. There are many ways to increase the customization of vue-router. You can add route guards to check whether specific routes are navigatable by access level or fetch data before entering the route to manage errors on your application.  In this chapter, you will learn how to create application routes, dynamic routes, alias and credited routes, and nested router views. We'll also look at how to manage errors, create router guards, and lazy load your pages.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Creating a simple route Creating a programmatic navigation Creating a dynamic router path Creating a route alias Creating a route redirect Creating a nested router view Creating a 404 error page Creating an authentication middleware Lazy loading your pages asynchronously   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.  Attention Windows users: you need to install an npm package called windows-build-tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do so, open the PowerShell as an administrator and execute the following command:  > npm install -g windows-build-tools  To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  Creating a simple route In your application, you can create an infinite combination of routes that can lead to any number of pages and components.  vue-router is the maintainer of this combination. We need to use this to set instructions on how to create paths and lay down routes for our visitors.   In this recipe, we will learn how to create an initial route that will lead to a different component.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 272 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router How to do it... To create a Vue-CLI project, follow these steps:  Chapter 6  1.  We need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create initial-routes  2.  3.  The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue, and the Spacebar to select an option.  There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method is a basic Babel and ESLint project without any plugins or configuration, and the Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins, linters, and options. We will go for Manually:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys   default  babel, eslint  ❯ Manually select features ‌  4.  Now we are asked about the features that we will want on the project. Those features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Vue Router  Vue-Router , testers, linters, and more. Select Babel, Router, and Linter   Formatter:  ? Check the features needed for your project:  Use arrow keys  ❯ Babel   TypeScript   Progressive Web App  PWA  Support ❯ Router   Vuex   CSS Pre-processors ❯ Linter   Formatter   Unit Testing   E2E Testing  5.  Now Vue-CLI will ask if you want to use the history mode on the route management. We will choose Y  yes :  ? Use history mode for router?  Requires proper server setup for   index fallback in production   Y n  y  [ 273 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  6.  Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatted. In our case, we will select ESLint + Airbnb config:  ? Pick a linter   formatter config:  Use arrow keys    ESLint with error prevention only ❯ ESLint + Airbnb config   ESLint + Standard config   ESLint + Prettier  7.  After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  8.  After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to store them is in a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store them in the package.json:  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  9.  Now you can choose whether you want to make this selection a preset for future projects, so you don't need to reselect everything again:  ? Save this as a preset for future projects?  y N  n  Our recipe will be divided into five parts:  Creating the NavigationBar component Creating the contact page Creating the about page Changing the application's main component Creating the routes  Let's get started.

Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  1.  Create a div HTML element with the id attribute defined as "nav", and inside of it, create three RouterLink components. Those components will point to the Home, About, and Contact routes. In the RouterLink component, we will add a to attribute that will be defined as the route for each component, respectively, and define the text content as the name of the menu:            Home              About              Contact        [ 275 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router Creating the contact page We need to make sure the contact page gets rendered when the user enters the  contact URL.

Inside the div HTML element, add the NavigationBar component and the RouterView component:                           Creating the routes Now we need to make the routes available in the application. To do so, first, we need to declare the routes and the components that the routes will render. Follow these steps to create your Vue application router correctly:  1. 2.  In the src router folder, open the index.js file. Import the Contact component page:  import Vue from 'vue'; import VueRouter from 'vue-router'; import Home from '.. views Home.vue'; import Contact from '.. views contact.vue';  3.  In the routes array, we need to create a new route object. This object will have the path property defined as ' contact', name defined as 'contact', and component pointing to the imported Contact component:  {   path: ' contact',   name: 'contact',   component: Contact, },  [ 278 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... When vue-router is added to Vue as a plugin, it starts to watch for changes on window.location.pathname, and other URL properties, to check the weight of the current URL on the browser against the list of URLs on your router configurations.   In this particular case, we are using a direct URL and a non-dynamic URL. Because of that, the vue-router plugin only needs to check direct matches of the URL paths and doesn't need to weigh the possible matches against a regex validator.  After a URL is matched, the router-view component acts as a dynamic component and renders the component we defined on the vue-router configuration.

Using this method enables the usage of special route directions, such as passing parameters and navigation with the route name.  In this recipe, we will learn how to execute a programmatic navigation function, using the extra possibilities it provides.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we created in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe, or we can start a new one.   To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create route-project  Choose the manual features and add the Router as a needed feature, as indicated in the 'How to do it...' section in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe.  [ 280 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Our recipe will be divided into two parts:  Changing the application's main component Changing the contact view  Let's get started.  Chapter 6  Changing the application's main component We will start with the App.vue file. We will add a programmatic navigation function to be executed after a timeout, which will be added to the component life cycle hook.  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these  instructions to create the component correctly:  1. 2.  Open App.vue in the src folder. Add a mounted property:  mounted   {}  3.  In the mounted property, we need to add a setTimeout function, which will execute the $router.push function. When executed, this function receives a JavaScript object as an argument, with two properties, name, and params:  mounted   {   setTimeout    => {     this.$router.push {       name: 'contact',       params: {         name: 'Heitor Ribeiro',         age: 31,       },     } ;   }, 5000 ; },  Changing the contact view On the contact view, we need to add an event listener, which will grab the route change and execute an action.

Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  Chapter 6  1. 2.  Open contact.vue in the src views folder. Add a new mounted property:  mounted   {}  3.  In this property, we will add a verification that will check whether there are any parameters on the $route.params object and display an alert with that $route.params:  mounted   {   if  Object.keys this.$route.params .length  {     alert `Hey! I've got some parameter!        ${JSON.stringify this.$route.params }` ;   } },  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  [ 282 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router How it works... The $router.push function, when executed, tells vue-router to change where the application is, and in this process, you are passing down some parameters to the new router that will replace the current route. In those parameters, there's a property called params, which sends a group of parameters to the new router.  Chapter 6  When entering this new router, all the parameters that we will have called from within the router will be available in the $route.params object; there, we can use it in our view or component.  There's more... In the programmatic navigation, it's possible to navigate through the routers, adding them to the browser history with the $router.push function, but there are other functions that can be used too.  The $router.replace function will replace the user navigation history for a new one, making it unable to go back to the last page.  $router.go is used to move the user navigation history in steps. To go forward, you need to pass positive numbers and to go backward, you will need to pass negative numbers.

In this recipe, we'll take a look at how dynamic routes come into play. With dynamic routes, you can define custom variables that can be set via the URL, and your application can start with those variables already defined.  In this recipe, we will learn how to use a dynamic router path on a CRUD list.  [ 283 ]   Chapter 6  Managing Routes with vue-router Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we completed in the 'Creating a CRUD interface with axios and Vuesax' recipe in Chapter 5, Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests. In the following steps, we will add vue-router to the project through the Vue UI dashboard:  1.  First, you will need to open vue ui. To do this, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue ui  2.  3.  4.  There, you will need to import the project by locating the project folder. After importing vue ui, you will be redirected to the dashboard. Add vue-router to the plugins by going to the plugins management page and clicking on the Add vue-router button. Then, click on the Continue button. The Vue-CLI will automatically install and configure vue-router on the project for us. We now need to create each view for the List, View, and Edit pages.  To start view development, we will go first by the user list route. In each route, we will deconstruct the old component that we had made, and recreate it as a view.  Our recipe will be divided into eight parts:  Changing the application's main component Changing the route mixin Axios instance configuration User list view  [ 284 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  User create view User information view User update view Creating dynamic routes  Let's get started.  Changing the application's main component After adding the vue-router plugin, App.vue will change. We need to revert the changes made by the installation of the vue-router. This is needed because when vue-ui adds the vue-router plugin, it will change App.vue, adding an example code that we don't need.  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  1. 2.  Open App.vue in the src folder. Remove everything, leaving just the divapp HTML element and the router- view component:                     Changing the route mixin In the previous recipe, we used a changeComponent mixin. Now that we are going to work with routes, we need to change this mixin to a changeRoute mixin and alter its behavior. In the following steps, we will change how the mixin works, to be able to change the route instead of the component:  1.  In the src mixin folder, rename changeComponent.js to changeRoute.js and open it.  [ 285 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  2.  We will remove the changeComponent method and create a new one called changeRoute. This new method will receive two arguments, name and id. The name argument is the route name, as set in the vue-router configuration and the id will be the user id that we will pass a parameter in the route change. This method will execute $router.push, passing those arguments as the parameters:  export default {   methods: {     async changeRoute name, id = 0  {       await this.$router.push {         name,         params: {           id,         },       } ;     },   } }  Axios instance configuration To fetch the data in the MirageJS server, we will need to define some options in our axios instance. Now, in the following steps, we will configure the axios instance to work with the new routering system:  1. 2.  In the src http folder, open the baseFetch.js file. At the creator of the localApi instance of axios, we will need to add an options object, passing the baseURL property. This baseURL will be the current browser navigation URL:  const localApi = createAxios {   baseURL: `${document.location.protocol}  ${document.location.host}`, } ;  User list view To create our view, we will extract the code from the list.vue component and reshape it as a page view.

At the Vue mixins property, we need to replace changeComponent with changeRoute:  mixins: [changeRouteMixin],  4.  In the getAllUsers and deleteUser methods, we need to remove ${window.location.href} from the getHttp and deleteHttp function parameters:  methods: {   async getAllUsers   {     const { data } = await getHttp `api users` ;     this.userList = data;   },   async deleteUser id  {     await deleteHttp `api users ${id}` ;     await this.getAllUsers  ;   }, }  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component.

In the following steps, we will create the dynamic routes of the application:  Chapter 6  1. 2.  Open index.js in the src router folder. First, we need to import the four new pages – List, View, Edit, Create, and Update:  import List from '@ views List.vue'; import View from '@ views View.vue'; import Edit from '@ views Edit.vue'; import Create from '@ views Create.vue';  3.  4.  On the routes array, we will add a new route object for each one of the pages that were imported. In this object, there will be three properties: name, path, and component. For the list route, we will define name as 'list', path as ' ', and component as the imported List component:  5.  On the view route, we will define name as 'view', path as ' view :id', and component as the imported View component:  6.  In the edit route, we will define name as 'edit', path as ' edit :id', and component as the imported Edit component:  {   path: ' ',   name: 'list',   component: List, },  {   path: ' view :id',   name: 'view',   component: View, },  {   path: ' edit :id',   name: 'edit',   component: Edit, },  [ 295 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  7.  Finally, at the create route, we will define name as 'create', path as ' create', and component as the imported Create component:  8.  When the VueRouter is created, we will add the mode options property and set it as 'history':  {   path: ' create',   name: 'create',   component: Create, },  const router = new VueRouter {   mode: 'history',   base: process.env.BASE_URL,   routes } ;  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  List View Route -   will be your user list page, containing a list of all the users in your application and buttons to view, edit, and delete it, as well as a button to create a new user:  [ 296 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  User View Route -  view :id will be your user view page, where it's possible to view your user information, such as the user's name, email, country, birthday, and phone number:  [ 297 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  User Edit Route -  update :id will be your user edit page, where it's possible to edit your user's information, changing the user's name, email, country, birthday, and phone number:  Create User Route -  update :id will be your user creation page, where it's  possible to create a new user on the system:  [ 298 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  How it works... When vue-router is created, and the route is passed for matching, the router analysis check for the best match for the route based on a RegEx for defining a weight on each route.  When a route is defined and has a variable in its path, you need to add a : before the variable parameter. This parameter is passed down to the component in the $route.params property.

Sometimes these evolutions can come through the form of a router change, for better naming or for a deprecated service. In vue-router, it's possible to make all those changes invisible to the user, so when they use old links, they still can access the application.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create a route alias for our application and use it.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we completed in the 'Creating a dynamic router path' recipe, or we can start a new one.

[ 300 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  Now, in the following steps, we will create the router alias:  1. 2.  Open index.js in the src router folder. At the list object, we will change the path property from ' ' to ' user' and for the alias property, we will set ' ':  3.  In the view object, we will change the path property from ' view :id' to ' user :id' and we will set the alias property to ' view :id':  4.  In the edit object, we will change the path property from ' edit :id' to ' user edit :id' and set the alias property to ' edit :id':  {   path: ' user',   name: 'list',   alias: ' ',   component: List, },  {   path: ' user :id',   name: 'view',   alias: ' view :id',   component: View, },  {   path: ' user edit :id',   name: 'edit',   alias: ' edit :id',   component: Edit, },  {   path: ' user create',   name: 'create',   alias: ' create',   component: Create, },  [ 301 ]  5.  Finally, in the create object, we will change the path property from ' create' to ' user create' and set the alias property to ' create':   Managing Routes with vue-router How it works... When the user enters your application, vue-router will try to match paths to the one that the user is trying to access. If there is a property called alias in the route object, this property will be used by the vue-router to maintain the old route under the hood and use the alias route instead. If an alias is found, the component of that alias is rendered, and the router remains as the alias, not showing the user the change, making it transparent.  Chapter 6  In our scenario, we made a transformation for our application to now handle all the users called on the  user namespace, but still maintaining the old URL structure so that if an old visitor tries to access the website, they will be able to use the application normally.  See also You can find more information about the vue-router alias at https: ​ ​router.​vuejs.​org  guide ​essentials ​redirect-​and-​alias.​htmlalias.​  Creating route redirects Router redirect works almost the same as the router alias, but the main difference is that the user is truly redirected to the new URL. Using this process, you are able to manage how the new route can be loaded.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 302 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router How to do it...

Now, in these steps, we will create the router redirect rules:  1. 2.  Open index.js in the src router folder. Insert a new route object at the end of the routes array. This object will have two properties, path and redirect. In the path property, we need to define the path that the user will enter, ' create-new-user', and in redirect, the path that the user will be redirected to, in this case, ' user create':  {   path: ' create-new-user',   redirect: ' user create', },  3.  Create a new object, and this object will have two properties, path and redirect. In the path property, we need to define the path that the user will enter, ' users', and in the redirect, we will create an object with a property called name and will put the value as 'list':  {   path: ' users',   redirect: {     name: 'list',   }, },  [ 303 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  4.  Create a new object. This object will have two properties, path and redirect. In the path property, we need to define the path that the user will enter, ' my- user :id?', and in the redirect, we will create a function, which will receive an argument, to, which is an object of the current route. We need to check whether the user ID is present in the route, to redirect the user to the edit page. Otherwise, we will redirect them to the user list:  {   path: ' my-user :id?',   redirect to  {     if  to.params.id  {       return ' user :id';     }     return ' user';   }, },  {   path: '*',   redirect: ' ', },  5.  Finally, in the end, we will create a route object with two properties, path and redirect. In the path property, we need to define the path that the user will enter, ' *', and in the redirect, we need to define the redirect property as ' ':  Remember that the last route with the '*' will always be the route that will be rendered when there is no match in the URL that your user is trying to enter.  How it works... As we define redirect as a new route, it works similar to the alias, but the redirect property can receive three types of arguments: a string when redirecting for the route itself, objects when redirecting with other parameters such as the name of the route, and last but not least, the function type, which redirect can handle and return one of the first two objects so the user can be redirected.

Our recipe will be divided into two parts:  Creating the router-view on the layout Changing the router files  Let's get started.  Creating the router-view on the layout When using vue-router with children's routes, we need to create the main view, which will have a special component called RouterView. This component will render the current router inside the layout or page you are rendering.  Now, in the following steps, we will create the layout for the pages:  1.  2. 3.  In the src views folder, we need to create a new folder called user and move the Create, Edit, List, and View pages to this new folder. Create a new file called Index.vue in the user folder and open it. In the single file component   section, add a router- view component:              export default {     name: 'User',   }    Changing the router files We will create a new file that will manage the user's specific routes, which will help us to maintain the code and make it cleaner.  [ 306 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router User routes In the following steps, we will create routes for the user:  Chapter 6  1. 2.  Create a new file called user.js in the src router folder. Import the Index, List, View, Edit, and Create views:  import Index from '@ views user Index.vue'; import List from '@ views user List.vue'; import View from '@ views user View.vue'; import Edit from '@ views user Edit.vue'; import Create from '@ views user Create.vue';  3.  Create an array and make it the default export of the file. In this array, add a route object, with four properties – path, name, component, and children. Set the path property as ' user', define the name property as 'user', define component as the imported Index component, and finally, define the children property as an empty array:  4.  In the children property, add a new route object with three properties – path, name, and component. Define path as '', name as 'list', and finally, define the component property as the imported List component:  export default [   {     path: ' user',     name: 'user',     component: Index,     children: [],   }, ]  {   path: '',   name: 'list',   component: List, },  [ 307 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  5.  Create a route object for the view route and use the same structure as the last route object. Define the path property as ':id', define name as 'view', and define component as the imported View component:  6.  Create a route object for the edit route and use the same structure as the last route object. Define the path property as 'edit :id', define name as 'edit', and define component as the imported Edit component:  7.  Create a route object for the create route, using the same structure as the last route object. Define the path property as 'create', define name as 'create' , and define component as the imported Create component:  {   path: ':id',   name: 'view',   component: View, },  {   path: 'edit :id',   name: 'edit',   component: Edit, },  {   path: 'create',   name: 'create',   component: Create, },  Router manager In the following steps, we will create the router manager that will control all the routes on the application:  1. 2.  Open the index.js in the src router folder. Import the newly created user.js file in the src router folder:  import Vue from 'vue'; import VueRouter from 'vue-router'; import UserRoutes from '. user';  [ 308 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  3.  In the routes array, add the imported UserRoutes as a destructed array:  const routes = [   ...UserRoutes,   {     path: '*',     redirect: ' user',   }, ];  How it works... vue-router provides the ability to use child routes as internal components of a current view or layout. This gives the possibility to create an initial route with a special layout file, and render the child component inside this layout through the RouterView component.   This technique is commonly used for defining a layout in an application and setting a namespace for the modules where the parent route can have a set of specific orders that will be available for every one of its children.

Creating a 404 error page There will be some occasions when your user may try to enter an old link or enter a typo and won't get to the correct route, and this should lead them directly to a not found error.  In this recipe, you will learn how to handle a 404 error in vue-router.

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Creating a nested router view' recipe, or we can start a new one.   To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create http-project  Choose the manual features and add Router as a required feature, as indicated in the 'How to do it...' section in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe.  Our recipe will be divided into two parts:  Creating the NotFound view Changing the router files  Let's get started.  Creating the NotFound view We need to create a new view to be displayed for the user when there is no matching route on the application. This page will be a simple, generic page.  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  1.  In the src views folder, create a new file called NotFound.vue and open it.  [ 310 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  2.  Create a VsRow component and inside of it create four VsCol components. All of those components will have the attribute vs-w defined as 12 and class as text-center:                                                       <vs-icon   icon="sentiment_dissatisfied"   size="large"  >  3.  On the first VsCol component, we will add a VsIcon component, and set the attribute icon as sentiment_dissatisfied and define the size as large:  4.  In the second VsCol component, we will add a title for the page:   Oops!   5.  In the third VsCol component, we need to create the text that will be placed on the page:   The page you are looking for are not here anymore...   6.  Finally, on the fourth VsCol component, we will add the VsButton component. This button will have the attribute type defined as relief and to defined as ' ':  <vs-button   type="relief"   to=" " >   Back to Home...    [ 311 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these  instructions to create the component correctly:  Chapter 6  1.  Add the scoped tag to the   tag:       2.  Create a new rule named .text-center, with the text-align property defined as center and margin-bottom defined as 20px;:  .text-center {   text-align: center;   margin-bottom: 20px; }  Changing the router files After we have created the view, we need to add it to the router and make it available to the user. To do it, we will need to add the view route into the router manager.  In these steps, we will change the router manager, to add the new error page:  1. 2.  Open index.js in the src router folder. Import the NotFound component:  import Vue from 'vue'; import VueRouter from 'vue-router'; import UserRoutes from '. user'; import NotFound from '@ views NotFound';  3.  In the routes array, after UserRoutes, add a new route object with two properties, path and redirect. Define the path property as ' ' and the redirect property as ' user':  {   path: ' ',   redirect: ' user' },  [ 312 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  4.  For the not found page, we need to create a new route object that needs to be placed in the last position in the routes array. This route object will have two properties, path, and component. The path property will be defined as '*' and component as the imported NotFound view:  {   path: '*',   component: NotFound, },  To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  How it works... vue-router tries to find the best match for the URL that the user wants to access; if there isn't a match, vue-router will use the '*' path as the default value for these scenarios, where the * represents any value that the user has entered that is not in the router lists.  Because the process of matching in vue-router is determined by the weight of the route, we need to place the error page at the very bottom, so vue-router needs to pass in every possible route before actually calling the NotFound route.

Those guards are used as middleware in the router management process. It's common to use them as an authentication middleware or session validators.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create authentication middleware, add metadata to our routes to make them restricted, and create a login page.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it...

[ 314 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  Our recipe will be divided into three parts:  Creating the authentication middleware Adding the metadata and the middleware to the router  Attaching the middleware to vue-router and creating the login page  Let's get started.  Creating the login view The login view will be the page that the user will see if they are not authenticated. We will construct a simple page with two inputs inside – a card and a button.   Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these  instructions to create the component correctly:  1. 2.  In the src views folder, create a new file called Login.vue and open it. Create a data property, containing username, password, and error:  data:    =>  {   username: '',   password: '',   error: false, } ,  3.  Then create the methods property with a method called userSignIn. This method will validate if the username and password data are complete. If it is, it will create a new key called 'auth' in sessionStorage, with encrypted stringified JSON of the username data. Then, set error to false and execute $router.replace to redirect the user to the user list ' user'. If any of the fields do not pass in any of the validations, the method will define the error as true and return false:  methods: {   userSignIn   {     if  this.username && this.password  {       window.sessionStorage.setItem 'auth',         window.btoa JSON.stringify {             username: this.username           }             [ 315 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6         ;       this.error = false;       this.$router.replace ' user' ;     }     this.error = true;     return false;   }, }  Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  1.  Create a div.container HTML element with a VsRow component inside. The VsRow component will have the attribute vs-align defined as "center" and vs-justify defined as "center":  2.  Inside the VsRow component, add a VsCol component with the attribute vs-lg defined as 4, vs-sm defined as 6, and vs-xs defined as 10. Then, inside the VsCol component, we will create a VsCard component with the style attribute defined as margin: 20px;:      <vs-row     vs-align="center"     vs-justify="center"   >        <vs-col   vs-lg="4"   vs-sm="6"   vs-xs="10" >   <vs-card     style="margin: 20px;"   >        [ 316 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  3.  Inside the VsCard component, create a dynamic   with the slot named  header, an h3 HTML element, and your title:  4.  After that, create a VsRow component with the attribute vs-align defined as "center", vs-justify defined as "center", and two VsCol components inside of it, with the attribute vs-w defined as 12:            User Login        <vs-row   vs-align="center"   vs-justify="center" >                    5.  On the first VsCol component, we will add a VsInput component, with the attribute danger defined as the data error value, danger-text defined as the text that will display on error, label defined as "Username", placeholder defined as "Username or e-mail", and the v-model directive bound to username:  <vs-input   :danger="error"   danger-text="Check your username or email"   label="Username"   placeholder="Username or e-mail"   v-model="username"  >  6.  In the second VsCol component, we will add a VsInput component, with the attribute danger defined as the data error value, danger-text defined as the text that will display on error, label defined as "Password", type defined as password, placeholder defined as "Your password", and the v- model directive bound to password:  <vs-input   :danger="error"   label="Password"  [ 317 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6    type="password"   danger-text="Check your password"   placeholder="Your password"   v-model="password"  >  7.  Finally, in the card footer, we need to create a dynamic   with the slot named footer. Inside this  , we will add a VsRow component with the vs-justify attribute defined as flex-start and insert a VsButton with the attribute color defined as success, type defined as filled, icon defined as account_circle, size defined as small and the @click event listener targeted to the userSignIn method:            <vs-button       color="success"       type="filled"       icon="account_circle"       size="small"       @click="userSignIn"     >       Sign-in              Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we will create the   section of the single file component. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:  1.  First, we need to make this section scoped, so the CSS rules won't affect any other component of the application:      2.  Then, we need to add the rules for the container class and the VsInput component:      .container {     height: 100vh;     display: flex;     flex-wrap: wrap;     justify-content: center;  [ 318 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6      align-content: center;   }    .vs-input {     margin: 5px;   }    To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run serve  Here is your component rendered and running:  Creating the middleware All vue-router middleware can also be referred to as navigation guards, and they can be attached to the application route changes. Those changes have some hooks that you can apply to your middleware. The authentication middleware takes place before the router changes, so we can handle everything and send the user to the correct route.  1.  In the src router folder, create a new folder called middleware, then create and open a new file called authentication.js.   [ 319 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  2.  In this file, we will create a default export function that will have three function parameters – to, from, and next. The to and from parameters are objects, and the next parameter is a callback function:  export default  to, from, next  => { };  3.  We need to check whether the route that we are being redirected to has an authenticated meta property set to true and whether we have a sessionStorage item with the 'auth' key. If we pass those validations, we can execute the next callback:  if  to.meta.authenticated && sessionStorage.getItem 'auth'   {   return next  ; }  4.  Then, if the first validation didn't pass, we need to check whether the router that we are redirecting the user to has the authenticated meta property and check whether it's a false value. If the validation did pass, we will execute the next callback:  if  !to.meta.authenticated  {   return next  ; }  5.  Finally, if none of our validations pass, execute the next callback, passing ' login' as an argument:  next ' login' ;  Adding the metadata and the middleware to the router After creating our middleware, we need to define which routes will be authenticated and which routes won't. Then we have to import the middleware to the router and define it when it is executed:  1. 2.  Open user.js in the src router folder. In each route object, add a new property called meta. This property will be an object with an authenticated key and a value defined as true. We need to do this to every route – even the children's routes:  import Index from '@ views user Index.vue'; import List from '@ views user List.vue'; import View from '@ views user View.vue';  [ 320 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  import Edit from '@ views user Edit.vue'; import Create from '@ views user Create.vue';  export default [   {     path: ' user',     name: 'user',     component: Index,     meta: {       authenticated: true,     },     children: [       {         path: '',         name: 'list',         component: List,         meta: {           authenticated: true,         },       },       {         path: ':id',         name: 'view',         component: View,         meta: {           authenticated: true,         },       },       {         path: 'edit :id',         name: 'edit',         component: Edit,         meta: {           authenticated: true,         },       },       {         path: 'create',         name: 'create',         component: Create,         meta: {           authenticated: true,         },       },     ],   }, ]  [ 321 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router  Chapter 6  3. 4.  Open index.js in the src router folder. Import the newly created middleware and the Login view component:   import Vue from 'vue'; import VueRouter from 'vue-router'; import UserRoutes from '. user'; import NotFound from '@ views NotFound'; import Login from '@ views Login'; import AuthenticationMiddleware from '. middleware authentication';  5.  Create a new route object for the login page view. This route object will have path set to ' login', name defined as 'login', component defined as Login, and the meta property will have the authenticated key with the value set to false:  6.  On the error handling route, we'll define the meta property authenticated as false because the login view is a public route:  7.  Finally, after the creation of the router constructor, we need to inject the middleware in the beforeEach execution:  router.beforeEach AuthenticationMiddleware ;  {   path: ' login',   name: 'login',   component: Login,   meta: {     authenticated: false,   }, },  {   path: '*',   component: NotFound,   meta: {     authenticated: false,   }, },  [ 322 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router How it works... Router guards work as middleware; they have a hook that is executed in each life cycle of the vue-router process. For the purposes of this recipe, we chose the beforeEach hook to add our middleware.  Chapter 6  In this hook, we checked whether the user was authenticated and whether the user needed authentication to navigate the route or not. After checking these variables, we continued the process by sending the user to the route they needed.

Lazy loading your pages asynchronously Components can be loaded when needed, and so can routes. Using lazy loading techniques with vue-router allows more code-splitting and smaller final bundles in your application.  In this recipe, we will learn how to transform routes in order to load them asynchronously.

Our recipe will be divided into two parts:  Updating the router manager Updating the user routes  Let's get started.  Updating the router manager To update the router manager, follow these instructions:  1. 2.  Open the index.js file in the src router folder. In each route that has a component property, we will transform the direct attribution of the component to a new function. This will be an arrow function returning the import   method of webpack:  {   path: ' login',   name: 'login',   component:    => import '@ views Login' ,   meta: {     authenticated: false,   }, },  3.  Repeat the process on each one of the route objects that has a component property.  [ 324 ]   Managing Routes with vue-router Updating the user routes To update the user routes, follow these instructions:  Chapter 6  1. 2.  Open the user.js file in the src router folder. In each route that has a component property, we will transform the direct attribution of the component to a new function. This will be an arrow function returning the import   method of webpack:  {   path: ' user',   name: 'user',   component:    => import '@ views user Index.vue' ,   meta: {     authenticated: true,   },   children: [], },  3.  Repeat the process on each one of the route objects that has a component property.  How it works... In ECMAScript, export and import are objects with predefined values when we use the export default method. This means that when we import a new component, this component is already being pointed to the default export of that file.   To carry out the lazy loading process, we need to pass a function that will be executed at runtime, and the return of that function will be the part of the code that webpack divides in the bundling process.  When we call this function in vue-router, instead of the direct component import, vue- router does a validation check that the present component import is a function and needs to be executed. After the execution of the function, the response is used as the component that will be displayed on the user's screen.  Because the webpack import   method is asynchronous, this process can happen alongside other code execution, without tempering or blocking the main thread of the JavaScript VM.

You will need to trigger an event in an event bus or send the event through all the parent components until it reaches over the top of the event chain and then gets sent all the way down to the desired component; this process can be very tedious and painful. If you are developing a large-scale application, this process is not sustainable.  Flux libraries were developed to help with this process, with the idea of bringing the reactivity outside of the component bounds, as Vuex is capable of maintaining one single source of truth of your data and, at the same time, is the place for you to have your business rules.  In this chapter, we will learn how to use Vuex, develop our store, apply it to our components, and namespace it so we can have different modules of Vuex inside the same store.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Creating a simple Vuex store Creating and understanding the Vuex state Creating and understanding the Vuex mutations Creating and understanding the Vuex actions Creating and understanding the Vuex getters Creating a dynamic component with Vuex Adding hot module reload for development Creating a Vuex module   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.  Attention, Windows users, you need to install an NPM package called windows-build-tools, to be able to install the following required packages. To do it, open PowerShell as administrator and execute the following command:  > npm install -g windows-build-tools  To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  Creating a simple Vuex store Creating a single source of truth in your application gives you the power to simplify the flow of your data, enabling the reactivity of the data to flow into another perspective, where you are not tied to a parent-child relationship anymore. The data can now be stored in a single place and everyone can fetch or request data.   In this recipe, we will learn how to install the Vuex library and create our first single store, and how we can manipulate it with reactive actions and data getters.  Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 328 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex How to do it... To create a Vue-CLI project, follow these steps:  Chapter 7  1.  We need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create initial-vuex  2.  3.  The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue, and the Spacebar to select an option.  There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method is a basic babel and eslint project without any plugin or configuration, and the Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins, linters, and options. We will go for Manually:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys    default  babel, eslint  ❯ Manually select features  4.  Now we are asked about the features that we will want in the project. Those features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Router  Vue-Router , testers, linters, and more. Select Babel, Router, Vuex, and Linter   Formatter:  ? Check the features needed for your project:  Use arrow keys  ❯ Babel   TypeScript   Progressive Web App  PWA  Support ❯ Router ❯ Vuex   CSS Pre-processors ❯ Linter   Formatter   Unit Testing   E2E Testing  5.  Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatter. In our case, we will select the ESLint + Airbnb config:  ?

After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  7.  After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to store them is on a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store them in the package.json file:  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use   arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  8.

Creating the store Now you have the project with the Vuex library, and we need to create our first store. In the following steps, we will create the Vuex store:  1. 2.  Open the index.js from the src store folder. In the state property, add a new key called counter and set the value to 0:  state: {   counter: 0, },  [ 330 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  3.  In the mutations property, add two new functions, increment and decrement. Both of the functions will have a state argument, which is the current Vuex state object. The increment function will increment the counter by 1 and the decrement function will decrement the counter by 1:  4.  Finally, in the actions property, add two new functions, increment and decrement. Both of the functions will have a deconstructed argument, commit, which is a function to call the Vuex mutation. In each function, we will execute the commit function, passing as a parameter the name of the current function as a string:  mutations: {   increment:  state  => {     state.counter += 1;   },   decrement:  state  => {     state.counter -= 1;   }, },  actions: {  increment { commit }  {  commit 'increment' ;  },  decrement { commit }  {  commit 'decrement' ;  }, },  Creating the reactive component with Vuex Now that you have your Vuex store defined, you need to interact with it. We will create a reactive component that will display the current state counter on the screen, and show two buttons, one for incrementing the counter, and another for decrementing the counter.

Open the App.vue file from the src folder. Create the   section in the file, with an export default object:      export default {};    3.  In the newly created object, add the Vue computed property with a property called counter. In this property we need to return the current $store.state.counter:  computed: {   counter   {     return this.$store.state.counter;   }, },  4.  Finally, create a Vue methods property with two functions, increment and decrement. Both of the functions will execute a $store.dispatch with a parameter being the function name as a string:  methods: {   increment   {     this.$store.dispatch 'increment' ;   },   decrement   {     this.$store.dispatch 'decrement' ;   }, },  Single ﬁle component   section Let's code the   section of the single file component:  1. 2. 3. 4.

When you declare your Vuex store, you need to create three main properties, state, mutations, and actions. Those properties act as a single structure, bounded to the Vue application through the $store injected prototype or the exported store variable.   A state is a centralized object that holds your information and makes it available to be used by the mutation, actions, or the components. Changing the state always requires a synchronous function executed through a mutation.  A mutation is a synchronous function that can change the state and is traceable, so when developing, you can time travel through all the executed mutations in the Vuex store.  An action is an asynchronous function, which can be used to hold business logic, API calls, dispatch other actions, and execute mutations. Those functions are the common entrance point of any change in a Vuex store.  [ 333 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  A simple representation of a Vuex store can be seen in this chart:  See also You can find more information about Vuex at https: ​ ​vuex.​vuejs.​org ​.  Creating and understanding the Vuex state The Vuex state can seem straightforward to understand. However, as the data gets more in- depth and nested, its complexity and maintainability can get more complicated.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create a Vuex state that can be used in the scenarios of both a Progressive Web Application  PWA   Single Page Application  SPA  and a Server Side Rendering  SSR , without any problems.  [ 334 ]   Chapter 7  Managing the Application State with Vuex Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Lazy Loading your pages asynchronously' recipe in Chapter 6, Managing Routes with vue-router, or we can start a new one.   To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vuex-store  Choose the manual features, add Router and Vuex as required features, as indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex store' recipe.  Our recipe will be divided into two parts:  Adding Vuex via the vue ui Creating the Vuex state  Let's get started.  Adding Vuex via the vue ui When importing an old project that was created via the Vue-CLI, it is possible to  automatically add Vuex through the vue ui interface without any effort at all. We will learn how to add the Vuex library to the old project, so we can continue developing the recipe.  [ 335 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  In the following steps, we will add the Vuex with the vue ui interface:  1.  In the project folder, open the vue ui by executing the following command on Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows :  > vue ui  2.  Select the correct project that you are working on. In the right sidebar, click on the Plugins menu icon:  3.  On the plugins page, on the top bar, click on the Add vuex button. This will trigger a pop-up modal, then click on the Continue button to finish the installation of Vuex on the application:  [ 336 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  4.  Adding the Vuex to our application will change the structure of the application. First, we will notice that there is a new folder called store in the src folder, and in the main.js file, it was added to the imports and the injection of the store in the Vue application:  import '. server server'; import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import Vuesax from 'vuesax'; import '. style.css'; import router from '. router' import store from '. store'  Vue.use Vuesax ;  Vue.config.productionTip = false;  new Vue {   router,   store,   render: h => h App  } .$mount 'app' ;  [ 337 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex Creating the Vuex state In order to save the data inside of Vuex, you need to have an initial state that is loaded with the application and defined as the default one when the user enters your application. Here, we are going to learn how to create the Vuex state and use it as a singleton, so that Vuex can be used in an SPA and an SSR page:  Chapter 7  Now we will create a Vuex store that can be used in an SSR and an SPA:  1.  2.  In the src store folder, create a new folder called user, and inside this folder create a new file named state.js. Create a new generateState function. This function will return a JavaScript object, with three main properties, data, loading, and error. The data property will be a JavaScript object, with a property called usersList defined as an empty array as default, and a property called userData with the default object of a user. The loading property will be a boolean, set to false by default, and error will have a default value initializing to null:  const generateState =    =>  {   data: {     usersList: [],     userData: {       name: '',       email: '',       birthday: '',       country: '',       phone: '',     },   },   loading: false,   error: null, } ;  3.  After creating the function, we will create an export default object at the end of the file, which will be a JavaScript object, and we will destruct the return of the generateState function:  export default { ...generateState   };  4. 5.  Create a new file named index.js in the user folder and open it. Import the newly created state:  import state from '. state';  [ 338 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  6.  At the end of the file, create an export default file as a JavaScript object. In this object, we will add the imported state:  export default {   state, };  7. 8.  Open the index.js file from the src store folder. Import the index.js file from the user folder:  import Vue from 'vue'; import Vuex from 'vuex'; import UserStore from '. user';  9.  In the export default function, which creates a new Vuex store, we will remove all the properties inside of it,  and put the imported UserStore deconstructed object inside the Vuex.Store parameter:  export default new Vuex.Store {   ...UserStore, }   How it works... When using the vue ui to add Vuex as a plugin, the vue ui will automatically add the required files, and import everything that is needed. This is the initial phase of the creation of a Vuex store.  First is the creation of an exclusive file for managing the state that we can use to separate, from the store, the process of how the state begins and how it can be initialized.  In this case of this state, we used a function to generate a completely new state every time it's called. This is a good practice, because in an SSR environment, the state of the server will always be the same, and we need to create a new state for each new connection.  After the creation of the state, we needed to create the default file for exporting the Vuex files that will be created in the user folder. This file is a simple import of all the files that will be created in the folder, state, actions, mutation, and getters. After the import, we export an object with the name of the required Vuex properties, state, actions, mutations, and getters.  [ 339 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  Finally, in the Vuex store, we import the file that aggregates everything and deconstructs it into our store to initialize it.  There's more... The Vuex state is a single source of truth in your application, it works like a global data manager, and it should not be changed directly. This is because we need to prevent the mutation of data with a concurrent mutation of the same data. To avoid that, we always need to change our state through the mutations, because the functions are synchronous and controlled by Vuex.  See also Find more information about the Vuex state at https: ​ ​vuex.​vuejs.​org ​guide ​state. html.  Creating and understanding the Vuex mutations When there is a change in Vuex, we need a way to execute this change in asynchronous form and keep track of it so it won't execute over another change before the first change finishes.  For this case, we need the mutations, which are functions that are only responsible for changing the state of your application.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create Vuex mutations and the best practices by which to do it.  Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  [ 340 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Creating and understanding the Vuex state' recipe, or we can start a new one.   To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vuex-store  Choose the manual features, add Router and Vuex as required features, as indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex store' recipe.  Now we create a Vuex mutation and base type for the mutations:  1.  2.  Create a new file called types.js in the user folder inside the src store folder, and open it. In this file, we will create an export default JavaScript object, with a group of keys that will be the names of our mutations. Those keys will be LOADING, ERROR, SET_USER_LIST, SET_USER_DATA, UPDATE_USER, and REMOVE_USER:  export default {   LOADING: 'LOADING',   ERROR: 'ERROR',   SET_USER_LIST: 'SET_USER_LIST',   SET_USER_DATA: 'SET_USER_DATA',   UPDATE_USER: 'UPDATE_USER',   REMOVE_USER: 'REMOVE_USER', }  3. 4.  Create a new file called mutations.js in the user folder, and open it. Import the newly created types.js file:  import MT from '. types';  [ 341 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  5.  Create a new function called setLoading, which will receive the Vuex state as an argument and will define the loading property of the state to true when executed:  const setLoading = state => {   state.loading = true; };  6.  Create a new function called setError, which will receive the Vuex state as an argument and payload. This function will set the loading property of the state to false, and the error property to the received payload argument:  const setError =  state, payload  => {   state.loading = false;   state.error = payload; };  7.  Create a new function called setUserList, which will receive the Vuex state and payload as an argument. This function will define the usersList property of the state.data to the received payload argument, set the loading property of the state to false, and the error property to null:  const setUserList =  state, payload  => {   state.data.usersList = payload;   state.loading = false;   state.error = null; };  8.  Create a new function called setUserData, which will receive the Vuex state and payload as arguments. This function will define the userData property of the state.data to the received payload argument, set the loading property of the state to false, and the error property to null:  const setUserData =  state, payload  => {   state.data.userData = payload;   state.loading = false;   state.error = null; };  [ 342 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  9.  Create a new function called updateUser, which will receive the Vuex state and payload as an argument. This function will update the user data in the usersList property of the state.data, define the loading property of the state to false, and the error property to null:  const updateUser =  state, payload  => {   const userIndex = state.data.usersList.findIndex u => u.id ===      payload.id ;   if  userIndex > -1  {     state.data.usersList[userIndex] = payload;   }   state.loading = false;   state.error = null; };  10.  Create a new function called removeUser, which will receive the Vuex state and payload as an argument. This function will remove the user data from the usersList property of the state.data, define the loading property of the state to false, and the error property to null:  const removeUser =  state, payload  => {   const userIndex = state.data.usersList.findIndex u => u.id ===      payload ;   if  userIndex > -1  {     state.data.usersList.splice userIndex, 1 ;   }   state.loading = false;   state.error = null; };  11.  Finally, create an export default object, with the keys being the types we created in the types.js file, and define each of the keys to the functions we created:  export default {   [MT.LOADING]: setLoading,   [MT.ERROR]: setError,   [MT.SET_USER_LIST]: setUserList,   [MT.SET_USER_DATA]: setUserData,   [MT.UPDATE_USER]: updateUser,   [MT.REMOVE_USER]: removeUser, }  [ 343 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  12. 13.  Open the index.js file in the user folder. Import the newly created mutations.js file, and add it to the export default JavaScript object:  import state from '. state'; import mutations from '. mutations';  export default {   state,   mutations, };  How it works... Each mutation is a function that will be called as a commit, and will have an identifier in the Vuex store. This identifier is the mutation key in the exported JavaScript object. In this recipe, we created a file that holds all the identifiers as an object value so that it can be used as a constant inside our code.   This pattern helps us in the development of Vuex actions, which need to know each mutation name.  When exporting the mutation JavaScript object, we use the constant as the key and the corresponding function as its value, so the Vuex store can execute the correct function when called.  See also Find more information about Vuex mutations at https: ​ ​vuex.​vuejs.​org ​guide  mutations.​html.  Creating and understanding the Vuex getters Accessing data from Vuex can be done through the state itself, which can be very dangerous, or via the getters. The getters are like data that can be preprocessed and delivered without touching or messing with the Vuex store state.  [ 344 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  The whole idea behind getters is the possibility to write custom functions that can extract data from your state in a single place when you need it, so that you get just the data you need.    In this recipe, we will learn how to create a Vuex getter and a dynamic getter that can be used as a high-order function.  Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Creating and understanding the Vuex mutations' recipe, or we can start a new one.   To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vuex-store  Choose the manual features, and add Router and Vuex as needed features, as indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex store' recipe.  In the following steps, we will create the Vuex getters:  1. 2.  Create a new file called getters.js in the src store user folder. Create a new function called getUsersList, and return the state.data.usersList property:  function getUsersList state  {   return state.data.usersList; }  [ 345 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  In a getter function, the first argument that the function will receive will be always the current state of the Vuex store.   3.  Create a new function called getUserData, and return the state.data.userData property:  function getUserData state  {   return state.data.userData; }  4.  Create a new function called getUserById, and return another function that receives userId as an argument. This returning function will return the result of a search of state.data.usersList that matches the same id as the userId received:  function getUserById state  {   return  userId  => {     return state.data.usersList.find u => u.id === userId ;   } }  5.  Create a new function called isLoading,  and return the state.loading property:  6.  Create a new function called hasError, and return the state.error property:  7.  Finally, create an export default JavaScript object, with all the created  functions as properties:  function isLoading state  {   return state.loading; }  function hasError state  {   return state.error; }  export default {   getUsersList,   getUserData,   getUserById,   isLoading,   hasError, };  [ 346 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  8. 9.  Open the index.js file in the src store user folder. Import the newly created getters.js file, and add it to the export default JavaScript object:  import state from '. state'; import mutations from '. mutations'; import getters from '. getters';  export default {   state,   mutations,   getters, };  How it works... Getters are like a GET function from an object and are static cached functions – they only change the returned value when the state has changed. But if you add the return as a high-order function, you can give it more power to use a more sophisticated algorithm and provide specific data.  In this recipe, we created two types of getters: the most basic, with simple data return, and the high-order function, which needs to be called as a function to retrieve the value you want.  There's more... Using getters with business logic is a good way to gather more data on the state. This is a good pattern because, on larger projects, it helps other developers to understand more what is going on in each of the GET functions and how it works behind the curtain.  You always need to remember that getters are synchronous functions and reactive to the state change, so the data on the getters is memoized and cached until the single source of truth receives a commit and changes it.

[ 347 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  Creating and understanding the Vuex actions You have all your state ready, your dataset, and now you need to fetch new data from an outside source or change this data inside your application. Here comes the part where actions do their job.   Actions are responsible for orchestrating the process in this communication between the application and the outside world. Controlling when the data need to be mutated on the state and returned to the caller of the action.   Usually, the action is a dispatch through a component or a view, but there are some occasions where actions can dispatch another action to create a chain of actions in your application.   In this recipe, we will learn how to create the actions needed in our application to define a user's list, update a user, and remove a user.   Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Creating and understanding the Vuex getters' recipe, or we can start a new one.   To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vuex-store  [ 348 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  Choose the manual features, and add Router and Vuex as required features, as indicated in the 'How to do it... section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex store' recipe.  Now follow these steps to create the Vuex actions:  1. 2.  Create a new file called actions.js in the src store user folder. Import the mutation types files  types.js , and the getHttp, patchHttp, postHttp, and deleteHttp functions from the fetchApi wrapper:  import {   getHttp,   patchHttp,   deleteHttp,   postHttp, } from '@ http fetchApi'; import MT from '. types';  3.  Create a new asynchronous function called createUser, which receives as the first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the commit property, and userData as the second argument, which will be used to create the user. Add a try catch statement, in the try context. First, we execute commit MT.LOADING , then we fetch the users lists from the API, and finally, commit MT.SET_USER_DATA, data , passing the users lists to be mutated. If we receive an exception and get into the Catch statement, we will execute commit MT.ERROR, error , passing the error that we receive to the state:  async function createUser { commit }, userData  {   try {     commit MT.LOADING ;     await postHttp ` api users`, {       data: {         ...userData,       }     } ;     commit MT.SET_USER_DATA, userData ;   } catch  error  {     commit MT.ERROR, error ;   } }  [ 349 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  4.  Create a new asynchronous function called fetchUsersList, which receives as the first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the commit property. Add a try catch statement in the try context. We execute commit MT.LOADING , then we fetch the users lists from the API, and finally, commit MT.SET_USER_LIST, data , passing the users lists to be mutated. If we receive an exception and get into the catch statement, we will  execute a mutation of commit MT.ERROR, error , passing the error that we receive to the state:  async function fetchUsersList { commit }  {   try {     commit MT.LOADING ;     const { data } = await getHttp `api users` ;     commit MT.SET_USER_LIST, data ;   } catch  error  {     commit MT.ERROR, error ;   } }  5.  Create a new asynchronous function called fetchUsersData, which receives as the first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the commit property, and the second argument the userId that will be fetched. Add a try catch statement, in the try context. We execute commit MT.LOADING , then we fetch the users lists from the API, and finally, commit MT.SET_USER_DATA, data , passing the users lists to be mutated. If we receive an exception and get into the catch statement, we will execute a mutation of commit MT.ERROR, error , passing the error that we receive to the state:  async function fetchUserData { commit }, userId  {   try {     commit MT.LOADING ;     const { data } = await getHttp `api users ${userId}` ;     commit MT.SET_USER_DATA, data ;   } catch  error  {     commit MT.ERROR, error ;   } }  [ 350 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  6.  Create a new asynchronous function called updateUser, which receives as the first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the commit property, and payload as the second argument. Add a try catch statement, in the try context. We execute commit MT.LOADING , then we patch the user data to the API and finally commit MT.UPDATE_USER, payload , passing the user new data to be mutated. If we receive an exception and get into the catch statement, we will execute a mutation of commit MT.ERROR, error , passing the error that we received to the state:  async function updateUser { commit }, payload  {   try {     commit MT.LOADING ;     await patchHttp `api users ${payload.id}`, {       data: {         ...payload,       }     } ;     commit MT.UPDATE_USER, payload ;   } catch  error  {     commit MT.ERROR, error ;   } }  7.  Create a new asynchronous function called removeUser, which receives as the first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the commit property, and userId as the second argument. Add a try catch statement, in the try context. We execute commit MT.LOADING , then we delete the user data from the API and finally, commit MT.REMOVE_USER, userId , passing the userId to be used in the mutation. If we receive an exception and get into the Catch statement, we will execute a mutation of commit MT.ERROR, error , passing the error that we receive to the state:  async function removeUser { commit }, userId  {   try {     commit MT.LOADING ;     await deleteHttp `api users ${userId}` ;     commit MT.REMOVE_USER, userId ;   } catch  error  {     commit MT.ERROR, error ;   } }  [ 351 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  8.  Finally, we will create an export default JavaScript object, with all the created functions as properties:  9.  Import the newly created actions.js file in the index.js in the src store user folder, and add it to the export default JavaScript object:  export default {   createUser,   fetchUsersList,   fetchUserData,   updateUser,   removeUser, }  import state from '. state'; import mutations from '. mutations'; import getters from '. getters'; import actions from '. actions';  export default {   state,   mutations,   getters,   actions, };  How it works... Actions are the initializers of all the Vuex life cycle changes. When dispatched, the action can execute a mutation commit, or another action dispatch, or even an API call to the server.  In our case, we took our API calls and put it inside the actions, so when the asynchronous function returns, we can execute the commit and set the state to the result of the function.

[ 352 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  Creating a dynamic component with Vuex Combining Vuex with Vue components, it's possible to employ the reactivity between multiple components without the need for direct parent-child communication, and split the responsibilities of the components.  Using this method allows the developer to enhance the scale of the application, where there is no need to store the state of the data inside the components itself, but using a single source of truth as a store for the whole application.  In this recipe, we will use the last recipes to improve an application, where it was using parent-child communication and making it as a single source of truth available in the whole application.  Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To create our dynamic component, we will transform the components from stateful to stateless, and will extract some parts that can be made into new components as well.  We will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Creating and understanding the Vuex actions' recipe, or we can start a new one.   To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vuex-store  Choose the manual features, and add Router and Vuex as required features, as indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex store' recipe.  [ 353 ]   Chapter 7  Managing the Application State with Vuex  Our recipe will be divided into five parts:  Creating the user list component Editing the user list page Editing the user view page Editing the user view page Editing the user create page  Let's get started.  Creating the user list component Because Vuex gives us the ability to have a single source of truth on our application, we can create a new component for our application that will handle the user listing and triggers the Vuex action that fetches the users list from the server. This component can be stateless and execute the Vuex actions by itself.  Single ﬁle component   section Let's code the   section of the single file component:  1. 2.  Create a new file called userList.vue in the src components folder. Import the changeRouterMixin from the src mixin folder:  import changeRouteMixin from '@ mixin changeRoute';  3.  Create an export default JavaScript object, and add a new Vue property called mixin, with a default value of an array. To this array, add the imported changeRouteMixin:  mixins: [changeRouteMixin],  4.  Create a new Vue property called computed. In this property, create a new value called userList.

Import the newly created Users List component, from the components folder:  import changeRouteMixin from '@ mixin changeRoute'; import UserTableList from '@ components userList';  3.  In the export default JavaScript object, add a new property called components. Declare the property as a JavaScript object, and add the imported UserTableList component to the object:  components: { UserTableList },  4.  In the methods property, at the getAllUsers function, we need to change the content to execute a Vuex dispatch when called. This method will perform the fetchUsersList Vuex action:  async getAllUsers   {   this.$store.dispatch 'fetchUsersList' ; },  5.  Finally, in the deleteUser function, we need to change the content to execute a Vuex dispatch when called. This method will perform the removeUser Vuex action, passing the userId as the argument:  async deleteUser id  {   this.$store.dispatch 'removeUser', id ;   await this.getAllUsers  ; },  [ 357 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex Single ﬁle component   section Let's code the   section of the single file component:  Chapter 7  1. 2.

Open the View.vue file in the users folder inside the view folder. In the UserForm component, change the v-model directive to a :value directive:  <user-form   :value="userData"   disabled  >  When using a read-only value, or you need to remove the syntactic sugar of the v-model directive, you can declare the input value as a :value directive and the value change event to an @input event listener.

In the Vue data property, change the name of the data from userData to tmpUserData:  data:    =>  {   tmpUserData: {     name: '',     email: '',     birthday: '',     country: '',     phone: '',   }, } ,  [ 359 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  3.  In the Vue computed property, add a new property called userData, which will return the Vuex getter getUserData:  userData   {   return this.$store.getters.getUserData; }  4.  Add a new Vue property named watch, and add a new property, userData, which will be a JavaScript object. In this object, add three properties, handler, immediate, and deep. The handler property will be a function that receives an argument called newData, which will set tmpUserData to this argument. The immediate and deep properties are both boolean properties set to true:  watch: {   userData: {     handler newData  {       this.tmpUserData = newData;     },     immediate: true,     deep: true,   } },  5.  In the Vue methods property, we need to change the contents of getUserById to dispatch a Vuex action named fetchUserData, passing the computed property userId as a parameter:  async getUserById   {   await this.$store.dispatch 'fetchUserData', this.userId ; },  6.  In the updateUser method, change the content to dispatch a Vuex action named updateUser, passing tmpUserData as a parameter:  async updateUser   {   await this.$store.dispatch 'updateUser', this.tmpUserData ;   this.changeRoute 'list' ; },  [ 360 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex Single ﬁle component   section In this part, we are going to write the   section of the single file component:  Chapter 7  1. 2.

In all four pages, we made changes that removed the business logic or API calls from the page to the Vuex store and tried making it less responsible for maintaining the data.  [ 361 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  Because of that, we could place a piece of code into a new component that can be placed anywhere in our application, and will show the current users lists without any limitations from the container that is instantiating it.  This pattern helps us in the development of more prominent applications, where there is a need for components that are less business-oriented and more focused on their tasks.

Adding hot-module-reload for development The hot-module-reload  HMR  is a technique used for the faster development of the application, where you don't need to refresh the whole page to get the new code you have just changed on the editor. The HMR will change and refresh only the part that were updated by you on the editor.  In all the Vue-CLI projects or Vue-based frameworks, such as Quasar Framework, the HMR is present in the presentation of the application. So each time you change any file that is a Vue component and it's rendered, the application will replace the old code for the new one on the fly.  In this recipe, we will learn how to add HMR to a Vuex store and be able to change the Vuex store without the need to refresh our entire application.  Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 362 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex How to do it... To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Creating a dynamic component with Vuex' recipe, or we can start a new one.   Chapter 7  To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vuex-store  Choose the manual features, add Router and Vuex as required features, as indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex store' recipe.  In the following steps, we will add HMR to Vuex:  1. 2.  Open the index.js file in the src store folder. Transform the export default into a constant called store, and make it exportable:  export const store = new Vuex.Store {   ...UserStore, } ;  3.  Check if the webpack hot-module-reload plugin is active:  if  module.hot  {}  4.  Create a new constant called hmr, which is an array containing the direction to the index.js, getters.js, actions.js, and mutations.js files of the user folder:  const hmr = [   '. user',   '. user getters',   '. user actions',   '. user mutations', ];  5.  Create a new function called reloadCallback. In this function, create three constants, getters, actions, and mutations. Each constant will point to the equivalent file inside the user folder, and call the store.hotUpdate function, passing an object as an argument with the values for the constants you created:  const reloadCallback =    => {   const getters = require '. user getters' .default;   const actions = require '. user actions' .default;  [ 363 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7    const mutations =  require '. user mutations' .default;    store.hotUpdate {     getters,     actions,     mutations,   }  };  Because of the Babel output of the files, you need to add the .default in the end of the files that you are dynamically importing with the webpack require function.   6.  Execute the webpack HMR accept function, passing as the first argument the hmr constant and reloadCallback as the second argument:  module.hot.accept hmr, reloadCallback ;  7.  Finally, default export the created store:  export default store;  How it works... The Vuex store supports HMR with the API of the webpack HMR plugin.  When it's available, we create a list of possible files that can be updated, so that webpack can be aware of any updates to those files. When any of those files are updated, a special callback that you created is executed. This callback is the one that enables Vuex to update or change the behavior of the updated file entirely.

[ 364 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  Creating a Vuex module As our application grows, working in a single object can be very risky. The maintainability of the project and the risks that it can generate on every change get worse each time.  Vuex has an approach called modules that helps us to separate our store into different branches of stores. These branches, or modules, have on each one of them a different set of state, mutation, getter, and action. This pattern helps with development and cuts the risk of adding new features to the application.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create a module and how to work with it, separating it into dedicated branches.  Getting ready The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Creating a dynamic component with Vuex' recipe, or we can start a new one.   To start a new one, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vuex-store  Choose the manual features and add Router and Vuex as required features, as indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex store' recipe.  [ 365 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Our recipe will be divided into two parts:  Creating the new authentication module Adding modules to Vuex  Let's get started.  Chapter 7  Creating the new authentication module To start, we need to create a new Vuex module. This example module will be called authentication, and will store the credentials data for the user.  In these steps, we will create the authentication module for Vuex:  1. 2. 3.  Create a new folder called authentication in the src store folder. In this newly created folder, create a new file called state.js, and open it. Create a function called generateState that will return a JavaScript object with the properties of data.username, data.token, data.expiresAt, loading, and error:  const generateState =    =>  {   data: {     username: '',     token: '',     expiresAt: null,   },   loading: false,   error: null, } ;  4.  Create an export default object at the end of the file. This object will be a JavaScript object. We will destruct the return of the generateState function:  export default { ...generateState   };  5.  Create a new file called index.js in the authentication folder inside the src store folder, and open it.  [ 366 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex  Chapter 7  6.  Import the newly created state.js file:  import state from '. state';  7.  Create an export default object at the end of the file. This object will be a JavaScript object. Add a new property called namespaced with the value set to true, and add the imported state:  export default {   namespaced: true,   state, };  Adding the modules to Vuex Now that we've created our modules, we will add them to the Vuex store. We can integrate the new modules with our old code. This is not a problem because Vuex will handle the new module as a namespaced object, with a completely separate Vuex store.  Now in these steps, we will add the created modules to the Vuex:  1. 2.  Open the index.js file in the src store folder. Import the index.js file from the authentication folder:  import Vue from 'vue'; import Vuex from 'vuex'; import UserStore from '. user'; import Authentication from '. authentication';  3.  In the Vuex.Store function, add a new property called modules, which is a JavaScript object. Then add the imported User and Authentication modules:  export default new Vuex.Store {   ...UserStore,   modules: {     Authentication,   } }   [ 367 ]   Managing the Application State with Vuex How it works... Modules work like separate Vuex stores but in the same Vuex single source of truth. This helps in the development of larger-scale applications because you can maintain and work with a more complex structure without the need to check for problems in the same file.  Chapter 7  In the meantime, it's possible to work with modules and the plain Vuex store, migrating from legacy applications so you don't have to re-write everything from the ground up to be able to use the module structure.  In our case, we added a new module named authentication with just a state present in the store, and continued with the old user Vuex store, so that in the future we can refactor the user store into a new module and separate it off into a more specific, domain-driven architecture.

[ 368 ]   8  Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  To have a more dynamic application and have the full attention of the user, using animation is crucial. Today, CSS animations are present in toasts, banners, notifications, and even input fields.  There are some cases where you need to create special animations, known as transitions, and have full control of what is happening on your page. To do this, you must use custom components and have the framework to help you with rendering your application.  With Vue, we can use two custom components that can help us create animations and transitions in our application with the help of CSS classes. Those components are Transition and TransitionGroup.  In this chapter, we will learn how to create a CSS animation, use the Animate.css framework to create a custom transition, use the Transition component hook to execute custom functions, create animations that execute on the render of the component, create animations and transitions for groups and lists, create reusable custom transition components, and create seamless transitions between components.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Creating your first CSS animation Creating a custom transition class with Animate.css Creating transactions with custom hooks Creating animations on page render Creating animations for lists and groups Creating a custom transition component Creating a seamless transition between elements   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.  Attention Windows users! You need to install an NPM package called windows-build-tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do so, open PowerShell as an Administrator and execute the > npm install -g windows-build-tools command.  To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or a Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  Creating the base project In this chapter, we will use this project as the base for each recipe. Here, I will guide you through how to create the base project:  1.  Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or a Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create {replace-with-recipe-name}  2.  Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset; select Manually select features using the spacebar:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys    default  babel, eslint  ❯ Manually select features  3.  Now, Vue-CLI will ask for what features you wish to install. You will need to select CSS Pre-processors as an additional feature on top of the default ones:  ? Check the features needed for your project:  Use arrow keys  ❯ Babel   TypeScript   Progressive Web App  PWA  Support   Router   Vuex ❯ CSS Pre-processors ❯ Linter   Formatter   Unit Testing   E2E Testing  [ 370 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  4.  Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatter. In our case, we will select ESLint + Airbnb config:  ? Pick a linter   formatter config:  Use arrow keys    ESLint with error prevention only ❯ ESLint + Airbnb config   ESLint + Standard config   ESLint + Prettier  5.  Choose the additional features of the linter. In our case, select the Lint on save and Lint and fix on commit:  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  6.  Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration files. In our case, we will select In dedicated config files:  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  7.  Finally, the CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings for future projects; select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create the folder and install the dependencies for you:  ? Save this as a preset for future projects?  y N  n  8.  From the created project, open the App.vue file, which is located in the src folder. In the   section of the single file component, remove the HelloWorld component. Add a data property and define it as a singleton function that's returning a JavaScript object with a property named display, and with a default value of true:    export default {   name: 'App',   data:    =>  {     display: true,   } , };    [ 371 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  9.  In the   section of the single file component, remove the HelloWorld component and add a button HTML element with the text Toggle. In the img HTML element, add a v-if directive bounded to the display variable. Finally, in the button HTML element, add a click event. In the event listener, define the value as an anonymous function that sets the display variable as the negation of the display variable:                    Toggle           <img       v-if="display"       alt="Vue logo" src=". assets logo.png">        With these instructions, we can create a base project for each recipe in this chapter.   Creating your first CSS animation With the help of CSS, we can animate our application without the need to manually program the changes of DOM elements through JavaScript. Using special CSS properties dedicated exclusively to controlling animations, we can achieve beautiful animations and transitions.  To use the animations that are available in Vue, we need to use a component called Transition when an animation is being applied to a single element or a component called TransitionGroup when dealing with a list of components.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create a CSS animation and apply this animation to a single element on the Vue application.  Getting ready The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI base project called cssanimation  [ 372 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called cssanimation and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:  1.  Open the App.vue file. In the   section of the single file component, wrap the img HTML element with a Transaction component. In the Transaction component, add a name attribute with a value of "image":      <img     v-if="display"     alt="Vue logo" src=". assets logo.png">    2.  In the   section of the single file component, create an .image-enter- active class with an animation property that has a value of bounce-in .5s. Then, create an .image-leave-active class with an animation property that has a value of bounce-in .5s reverse:  .image-enter-active {   animation: bounce-in .5s; } .image-leave-active {   animation: bounce-in .5s reverse; }  3.  Finally, create a @keyframes bounce-in CSS rule. Inside it, do the following: Create a 0% rule with a property transform and a value of scale 0 . Create a 50% rule with a property transform and a value of scale 1.5 . Create a 100% rule with a property transform and a value of scale 1 :  @keyframes bounce-in {   0% {     transform: scale 0 ;   }  [ 373 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8    50% {     transform: scale 1.5 ;   }   100% {     transform: scale 1 ;   } }  After doing this, your image will scale up and disappear when the toggle button is pressed for the first time. When pressed again, it will scale up and stay in the correct scale after the animation has finished:  How it works... First, we added the Vue animation wrapper to the element we wanted to add the transition to, and then added the name of the CSS class that will be used on the transition.   The Transition component uses pre-made namespaces for the CSS class that are required to be present. These are -enter-active, for when the component enters the screen, and -leave-active, for when the component leaves the screen.  [ 374 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  Then, we create the CSS classes in   for the transition of the element to leave and enter the screen, and the keyframe ruleset for the bounce-in animation in order to define how it will behave.

Creating a custom transition class with Animate.css In the Transition component, it is possible to define the CSS classes that will be used in each transition step. By using this property, we can make the Transition component use Animate.css in the transition animations.  In this recipe, we will learn how to use the Animate.css classes with the Transition component in order to create custom transitions in our components.  Getting ready The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI base project called animatecss  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 375 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS How to do it... Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called animatecss and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:  Chapter 8  1.  Inside the project folder, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or a Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command to install the Animate.css framework:  > npm install animate.css@3.7.2  2.  Open the main.js file in the src folder and import the Animate.css framework:  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import 'animate.css';  3.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder and add a Transition component as a wrapper for the img HTML element. In the Transition component, add an attribute called enter-active-class and define it as "animated bounceInLeft". Then, add another attribute called leave-active-class and define it as "animated bounceOutLeft":  <transition   enter-active-class="animated bounceInLeft"   leave-active-class="animated bounceOutLeft" >   <img     v-if="display"     alt="Vue logo" src=". assets logo.png">    After doing this, your image will slide out to the left and disappear when the toggle button is pressed for the first time. When pressed again, it will slide in from the left:  [ 376 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  How it works... The Transition component can receive up to six props that can set up custom classes for each step of the transaction. Those props are enter-class, enter-active-class, enter-to-class, leave-class, leave-active-class, and leave-to-class. In this recipe, we used enter-active-class and leave-active-class; these props defined the custom classes for when the element is visible on the screen or leaves the screen.  To use custom animations, we used the Animate.css framework, which provides custom CSS animations that have been pre-made and ready for use. We used bounceInLeft and bounceOutLeft in order to make the element slide in and out from the screen.  There's more... You can try to change the classes of the enter-active-class and leave-active-class props for any of the props available on Animate.css and see how the CSS animation behaves on the browser.

Creating transactions with custom hooks The Transaction component has custom event emitters for each animation life cycle. These can be used to attach custom functions and methods to be executed when the animations cycle is completed.  We can use these methods to execute data fetches after the page transaction completes or a button animation ends, thus chaining animations in a specific order that need to be executed one after another based on dynamic data.  In this recipe, we will learn how to use the custom event emitters of the Transaction component to execute custom methods.  Getting ready The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI base project called transactionhooks  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 378 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS How to do it... Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called transactionhooks and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:  Chapter 8  1.  Inside the project folder, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or a Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command to install the Animate.css framework:  > npm install animate.css@3.7.2  2.  Open the main.js file in the src folder and import the Animate.css framework:  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import 'animate.css';  3.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the   section of the single file component, in the data property, in the singleton function, add a new property called status with the value defined as "appeared":  data:    =>  {   display: true,   status: 'appeared', } ,  4.  Create a methods property and define it as a JavaScript object. Inside the object, add two properties called onEnter and onLeave. In the onEnter property, define it as a function, and inside of it, set the data status variable to"appeared". In the onLeave property, define it as a function, and inside of it set the data status variable to "disappeared":  methods: {   onEnter   {     this.status = 'appeared';   },   onLeave   {     this.status = 'disappeared';   }, },  [ 379 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  5.  In the   section of the single file component, add a Transition component as a wrapper for the img HTML element. In the Transition component, do the following:  Add an attribute called enter-active-class and define it as "animated rotateIn". Add another attribute called leave-active-class and define it as "animated rotateOut". Add an event listener after-enter bind and attach it to the onEnter method. Add an event listener after-leave bind and attach it to the onLeave method:  <transition   enter-active-class="animated rotateIn"   leave-active-class="animated rotateOut"   @after-enter="onEnter"   @after-leave="onLeave" >   <img     v-if="display"     alt="Vue logo" src=". assets logo.png">    6.  Create an h1 HTML element as a sibling of the Transition component and add the text The image {{ status }}:   The image {{ status }}   Now, when the button is clicked, the text will change when the animation finishes. It will show The image appeared when the animation finishes entering and The image disappeared when the animation has finished leaving:  [ 380 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  How it works... The Transition component has eight custom hooks. These hooks are triggered by the CSS animations and when they are triggered, they emit custom events, which can be used by the parent component. These custom events are before-enter, enter, after-enter, enter-cancelled, before-leave, leave, after-leave, and leave-cancelled.   When using the after-enter and after-leave hooks, when the CSS animations have finished, the text on the screen changes accordingly to the functions that have been defined on the event listeners for each hook.

[ 381 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  Creating animations on page render Using page transition animations or custom animations that are displayed on the render of a page is common and sometimes needed to catch the attention of the user of an application.   It's possible to create this effect in a Vue application without the need to refresh the page or re-render all the elements on the screen. You can do this using the Transition component or the TransitionGroup component.  In this recipe, we will learn how to use the Transition component so that the animation is triggered when the page is being rendered.  Getting ready The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI base project called transactionappear  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called transactionappear and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:  1.  Inside the project folder, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or a Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command to install the Animate.css framework:  > npm install animate.css@3.7.2  2.  Open the main.js file in the src folder and import the Animate.css framework:  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import 'animate.css';  [ 382 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  3.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder and add a Transition component as a wrapper for the img HTML element. In the Transition component, do the following:  Add an attribute called appear-active-class and define it as "animated jackInTheBox". Add an attribute called enter-active-class and define it as "animated jackInTheBox". Add another attribute called leave-active-class and define it as "animated rollOut". Add the appear attribute and define it as true:  <transition   appear   appear-active-class="animated jackInTheBox"   enter-active-class="animated jackInTheBox"   leave-active-class="animated rollOut" >   <img     v-if="display"     alt="Vue logo" src=". assets logo.png">    When the page opens, the Vue logo will shake like a jack-in-the-box and will be static after the animation has finished running:   [ 383 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS How it works... The Transition component has a special property called appear that, when enabled, makes the element trigger an animation when it is rendered on the screen. This property comes with three properties for controlling the animation CSS classes, which are called appear-class, appear-to-class, and appear-active-class.  Chapter 8  There are four custom hooks that are executed with this property as well, which are called before-appear, appear, after-appear, and appear-cancelled.  In our case, we made the component execute the jackInTheBox animation from the Animate.css framework when the component gets rendered on-screen.

You can find more information about Animate.css at https: ​ ​animate.​style ​.  Creating animations for lists and groups There are some animations that need to be executed within a group of elements or a list. These animations need to be wrapped in a TransitionGroup element in order to work.   This component has some properties that are the same as the ones in the Transition component, but to get it working, you have to define a set of special instructions for the child elements and the components that are specific to this component.  In this recipe, we will create a dynamic list of images that will be added when the user clicks on the respective button. This will execute the animation when the image appears on the screen.  Getting ready The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI base project called transactiongroup  [ 384 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called transactiongroup and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:  1.  Inside the project folder, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or a Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command to install the Animate.css framework:  > npm install animate.css@3.7.2  2.  Open the main.js file in the src folder and import the Animate.css framework:  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import 'animate.css';  3.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the   section of the single file component, on the data singleton, return a property called count with a value of 0:  data:    =>  {   count: 0, } ,  4.  In the   section of the single file component, remove everything inside the divapp HTML element. Then, as a child of the divapp HTML element, create a TransitionGroup component with an attribute called tag defined as "ul" and an attribute called enter-active-class defined as "animated zoomIn":      <transition-group     tag="ul"     enter-active-class="animated zoomIn"   >     [ 385 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  5.  As a child of the TransitionGroup component, create a li HTML element with the v-for directive, iterating over the count variable as i in count. Add a variable attribute called key defined as i and a style attribute defined as "float: left". As a child of the li HTML component, create an img HTML component with the src attribute defined as "https:  picsum.photos 100":  <li   v-for="i in count"   :key="i"   style="float: left" >        6.  Then, as a sibling element of the TransitionGroup component, create a hr HTML element with the style attribute defined as "clear: both":     7.  Finally, as a sibling of the hr HTML element, create a button HTML element with the click event, adding 1 to the current count variable and setting the text to Increase:  <button   @click="count = count + 1" >   Increase    Now, when the user clicks the respective button to increase the list, it will add a new item to the list and the zooming in animation will trigger:  [ 386 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS How it works... The TransitionGroup element creates a wrapper element with the tag you declared in the tag property. This will manage the custom elements that will trigger the animation by checking the unique identity of the child elements by their unique keys. Because of this, all the child elements inside the TransitionGroup component need to have a key declared and have to be unique.  Chapter 8  In our case, we created an HTML list using a combination of ul and li HTML elements, where TransitionGroup was defined with the ul tag and the child elements were defined with the li HTML elements. Then, we created a virtual iteration over a number. This means there will be a list of items and display images on-screen according to the number of items on that list.  To increase our list, we created a button HTML element that increased the count of the count variable by one each time it was pressed.

Creating a custom transition component Using a framework to create an application is good because you can make reusable components and shareable code. Using this pattern is great for simplifying the development of the application.   Creating a reusable transition component is the same as creating a reusable component and can have a simpler approach as it can be used with functional rendering instead of the normal rendering method.  In this recipe, we will learn how to create a reusable functional component that can be used in our application.  [ 387 ]   Chapter 8  Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS Getting ready The following are the prerequisites for this chapter:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI base project called customtransition  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called customtransition and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:  1.  Inside the project folder, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or a Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command to install the Animate.css framework:  > npm install animate.css@3.7.2  2.  Open the main.js file in the src folder and import the Animate.css framework:  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import 'animate.css';  3.  Create a new file named CustomTransition.vue in the src components folder and open it. In the   section of the single file component, add the functional attribute to enable the functional rendering of the component. Then, create a Transition component, with the appear variable attribute defined as props.appear. Define the enter-active-class attribute as "animated slideInLeft" and the leave-active-class attribute as "animated slideOutRight". Finally, inside the Transition component, add a   placeholder:      <transition     :appear="props.appear"     enter-active-class="animated slideInLeft"     leave-active-class="animated slideOutRight"  [ 388 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  4.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the   section of the single file component, import the newly created CustomTransition component. On the Vue object, add a new property called components, define it as a JavaScript object, and add the imported CustomTransition component:    import CustomTransition from '. components CustomTransition.vue';    >              export default {   name: 'App',   components: {     CustomTransition,   },   data:    =>  {     display: true,   } , };    5.  Finally, in the   section of the single file component, wrap the img HTML element with the CustomTransition component:      <img     v-if="display"     alt="Vue logo" src=". assets logo.png">    [ 389 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  With this custom component, it's possible to reuse the transition without the need to redeclare the Transition component and the transition CSS classes on the component:  How it works... First, we created a custom component using the functional component method, where there is no need to declare the   section of the single file component.  In this custom component, we used the Transaction component as the base component. Then, we defined the appear attribute with the injected functional context, prop.appear, and added the animations classes for the transition to slide in from the left when the component is rendered and slide out from the right when it's destroyed.  Then, in the main application, we used this custom component to wrap the img HTML element and make it work as the Transition component.

[ 390 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  Creating a seamless transition between elements When there are animations and transitions between two components, they need to be seamless so that the user won't see the DOM shaking and redrawing itself when the components are being placed on the screen. To achieve this, we can use the Transition component and the transition mode property to define how the transition will occur.  In this recipe, we will create a transition between images using the Transition component and the transition mode attribute to create a seamless animation.  Getting ready The following are the prerequisites for this chapter:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI base project called seamlesstransition  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called seamlesstransition and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:  1.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the   section of the single file component, create a property called .rotate-enter-active,.rotate- leave-active and define the transition CSS style property as transform .8s ease-in-out;. Then, create a property called .rotate-enter,.rotate- leave-active and define the transform CSS style property as rotate  -180deg  ; and transition as .8s ease-in-out;:  .rotate-enter-active, .rotate-leave-active {   transition: transform .8s ease-in-out; }  [ 391 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  .rotate-enter, .rotate-leave-active {   transform: rotate  -180deg  ;   transition: transform .8s ease-in-out; }  2.  In the   section of the single file component, wrap the img HTML element with a Transition component. Then, define the name attribute as rotate and the mode attribute as out-in:  <transition   name="rotate"   mode="out-in" >   3.  Inside the Transition component, in the img HTML element, add a key attribute and define it as up. Then, add another img HTML element and add a v- else directive. Add a key attribute and define it as down, add an src attribute and define it as ". assets logo.png", and finally add a style attribute and define it as "transform: rotate 180deg ":  <img   v-if="display"   key="up"   src=". assets logo.png"> <img   v-else   key="down"   src=". assets logo.png"   style="transform: rotate 180deg " >  When the user toggles the element, the leaving animation will be executed, and then after it has finished, the entering animation will start with no delay. This makes for a seamless transition between the old element and the new one:  [ 392 ]   Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS  Chapter 8  How it works... The Transition component has a special attribute called mode, where it is possible to define the behavior of the element's transition animation. This behavior will create a set of rules that controls how the animation steps will occur inside the Transition component. It's possible to use "in-out" or "out-in" mode in the component:  In the "in-out" behavior, the new element transition will occur first, and when it's finished, the old element transition will start. In the "out-in" behavior, the old element transition will occur first, and then the new element transition will start.  In our case, we created an animation that rotates the Vue logo upside down. Then, to handle this seamless change, we used "out-in" mode so that the new element will only show up after the old one has finished the transition.

[ 393 ]   9  Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Using UI frameworks and libraries is a good way to increase productivity and help the development of your application. You can focus more on the code and less on the design.  Learning how to use such frameworks means that you know how these frameworks behave and work. This will help you in the process of developing an application or a framework in the future.  Here, you will learn more about the usage of frameworks when creating user registration forms and all the components that are needed for a page. In this chapter, we will learn how to create a layout, a page, and a form using Buefy, Vuetify, and Ant-Design.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Buefy Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Vuetify Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Ant-Design   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.  Attention Windows users: you need to install an npm package called windows-build-tools. To do so, open PowerShell as administrator and execute the following command:  > npm install -g windows-build-tools  To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Buefy Bulma was one of the first frameworks to be used for rapid prototyping and web  development that didn't require a JavaScript library attached to it. All the special components that needed to be coded were the responsibility of the developer using the framework.  With the advent of JavaScript frameworks and the community that was created around the Bulma framework, a wrapper for Vue was created. This wrapper takes all the responsibility of JavaScript component development and delivers a complete solution for developers to use the Bulma framework within their applications, without the need to re-invent the wheel.  In this recipe, we will learn how to use the Buefy framework with Vue and how to create a layout, a page, and a user registration form.  Getting ready The pre-requisites for this recipe are as follows:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI project  [ 395 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... To create a Vue-CLI project with the Buefy framework, we need to create a Vue-CLI project  first and then add the Buefy framework to the project. We will divide this recipe into four parts: creating the Vue-CLI project, adding the Buefy framework to the project, creating the layout and the page, and finally creating the user registration form.  Creating the Vue-CLI project Here we will create the Vue-CLI project to be used in this recipe. This project will have custom settings to be able to work with the Buefy framework:  1.  We need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create bulma-vue  2.  Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset – select Manually select features:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys    default  babel, eslint  ❯ Manually select features  3.  Now the Vue-CLI will ask for the features, and you will need to select CSS Pre- processors as an additional feature on top of the default ones:  ? Check the features needed for your project:  Use arrow keys  ❯ Babel   TypeScript   Progressive Web App  PWA  Support   Router   Vuex ❯ CSS Pre-processors ❯ Linter   Formatter   Unit Testing   E2E Testing  [ 396 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  4.  Here the Vue-CLI will ask which CSS pre-processor you want to use; select Sass SCSS  with node-sass :  ? Pick a CSS pre-processor  PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules are supported by default :  Use arrow keys    Sass SCSS  with dart-sass  ❯ Sass SCSS  with node-sass    Less   Stylus  5.  Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatted. In our case, we will select the ESLint + Airbnb config:  ? Pick a linter   formatter config:  Use arrow keys    ESLint with error prevention only ❯ ESLint + Airbnb config   ESLint + Standard config   ESLint + Prettier  6.  Choose the additional features of the linter  here, Lint and fix on commit :  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  7.  Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration files  here, In dedicated config files :  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  8.  Finally, the Vue-CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings for future projects; you should select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create the folder and install the dependencies for you:  ? Save this as a preset for future projects?  y N  n  [ 397 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks Adding Buefy to the Vue-CLI project To use Bulma in a Vue project, we are going to use the Buefy UI library. This library is a wrapper around the Bulma framework and provides all the components that are available with the original framework and some additional components to use:  Chapter 9  1.  In the folder that you created for your Vue-CLI project, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue add buefy  2.  Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to choose a style to work with Buefy; we will go with scss:  ? Add Buefy style?  Use arrow keys    none   css ❯ scss  3.  Then, Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to include the Material Design icons; for this project, we won't use them:  ? Include Material Design Icons?  y N  n  4.  Now Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to include Font Awesome icons; we will add them to the project:  ? Include Font Awesome Icons?  y N  y  Creating the layout and a page with Buefy To create a page, we need to create a layout structure and the base components for the page, such as a header menu, a footer, and the hero section of the page.  Creating the header menu component In our design, we will have a header menu, with a basic combination of links and call-to- action buttons:  1.  Create a new file named top-menu.vue in the src components folder and open it.  [ 398 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  2.  In the   section of the single file component, we will export a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as TopMenu:    export default {   name: 'TopMenu', };                 3.  In the   section of the single file component, create a section HTML element with the section class, and add a child div HTML element with the container class:  4.  Now create a b-navbar component as a child of the div.container HTML element, and add as a child a template placeholder component, with the named slot as brand. Inside that, add a b-navbar-item component with the href attribute defined as  and add an img HTML element as a child:                    <img src="https:  raw.githubusercontent.com buefy buefy dev                 static img buefy-logo.png"         alt="Lightweight UI components for Vue.js based on Bulma"       >              5.  After this template placeholder, create another template placeholder with the named slot as start. Inside it, create two b-navbar-item components with the href attribute defined as . Create, as a sibling component, a b-navbar- dropdown component with the label attribute defined as Info. In this component, add two b-navbar-item components as children with the href attribute defined as :            Home          [ 399 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  6.  Finally, create another template placeholder with the named slot as end. Create a b-navbar-item component as a child component with the tag attribute defined as div, and add a div HTML element as a child of this component with the buttons class. In the div HTML element, create an a HTML element with the button is-primary class, and another a HTML element with the button is-light class:      Documentation                     About                   Contact                                           Sign up                          Log in                      Creating the hero section component We will create a hero section component. A hero component is a full-width banner that provides visual information on the page to the user:  1.  2.  Create a new file named hero-section.vue in the src components folder and open it. In the   section of the single file component, we will export a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as HeroSection:    export default {   name: 'HeroSection',  [ 400 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  };    3.  In the   section of the single file component, create a section HTML element with the hero is-primary class, then add  a div HTML element as a child, with the hero-body class:               4.  Inside the div.hero-body HTML element, create a child div HTML element with the container class. Then, add an h1 HTML element as a child with the title class and an h2 HTML element with the subtitle class:  Creating the footer component The final component that we are going to use in our layout is the footer component. This will be displayed as the footer of our page:  1.  2.  Create a new file named Footer.vue in the src components folder and open it. In the   section of the single file component, we will export a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as FooterSection:            user Registration             Main user registration form          export default {   name: 'FooterSection', };    [ 401 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  3.

Create a new folder called layouts in the src folder, and create a new file named Main.vue and open it. In the   section of the single file component, import the footer- section component and the top-menu component:  import FooterSection from '.. components Footer.vue'; import TopMenu from '.. components top-menu.vue';  [ 402 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  3.  Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as Mainlayout, and define the components property with the imported components:  4.  Finally, in the   section of the single file component, create a div HTML element with the child top-menu component, a slot placeholder, and the footer-section component:  export default {   name: 'Mainlayout',   components: {     TopMenu,     FooterSection,   }, };                                 Creating the user registration form with Buefy Now we are going to create the user registration form and make the final page. In this step, we will join the outputs of all the other steps into a single page:  1.  Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the   section of the single file component, import the main-layout component and the hero- section component:  import Mainlayout from '. layouts main.vue'; import HeroSection from '. components heroSection.vue';  2.  Then, we will export a default JavaScript object with the name property defined as App, then define the components property with the imported components. Add the data property to the JavaScript object, with the name, username, password, email, phone, cellphone, address, zipcode, and country properties:  export default {   name: 'App',  [ 403 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9    components: {     HeroSection,     Mainlayout,   },   data:    =>  {     name: '',     username: '',     password: '',     email: '',     phone: '',     cellphone: '',     address: '',     zipcode: '',     country: '',   } , };                     3.  In the   section of the single file, add the imported main-layout component and add hero-section as a child component:  4.  After the hero-section component, create a sibling section HTML element, with the section class, and add a child div HTML element with the container class. In this div HTML element, create a h1 HTML element with the title is-3 class and a sibling hr HTML element:             Personal Information               5.  Then, create a b-field component as a sibling of the hr HTML element, with Name for label, and add a child b-input with the v-model directive bound to name. Do the same for the email field, changing label to Email, and the v- model directive bound to email. In the email b-input, add a type attribute  defined as email:      <b-input  [ 404 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9      v-model="name"    >   <b-field   label="Email" >   <b-input     v-model="email"     type="email"    >    6.

Finally, create a b-field component as a sibling of the b-field component, with the position attribute defined as is-right and the grouped attribute. Then, create two div HTML element with the control class. In the first div HTML element, add a button HTML element as a child with the button is danger is-light class,  and in the second div HTML element, create a child button HTML element with the button is-success class:   <b-field   position="is-right"   grouped >          Cancel       [ 407 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9           Submit         How it works... First, we create a Vue-CLI project, with the basic configurations, and the additional CSS pre-processor node-sass. Then, we were able to add the Buefy framework to our project, using Vue-CLI and the Buefy plugin. Using the Buefy framework, we created a layout page component, with a header menu component and a footer component.   For the page, we used the Bulma CSS container structure to define our page, and place our user registration form on a default grid size. Then, we added the hero section component, for the page identification, and finally, we created the user registration form and inputs.  Here is a screenshot of the final project up and running:  [ 408 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks See also Find more information about Bulma at http: ​ ​bulma.​io ​.  Find more information about Buefy at https: ​ ​buefy.​org ​.  Chapter 9  Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Vuetify Vuetify is on the top three list of the most well-known UI frameworks for Vue. Based on Material Design by Google, this framework was initially designed by John Leider and is  now gathering ground in the Vue ecosystem as the go-to UI framework for the initial development of an application.  In this recipe, we will learn how to use Vuetify to create a layout component wrapper, a page, and a user registration form.  Getting ready The pre-requisites for this recipe are as follows:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI project  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... We will divide this recipe into four main sections. The first and second sections are  dedicated to the creation of the project and the installation of the framework and the last two sections are dedicated to the creation of the user registration page and the components needed to create it.  [ 409 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks Creating the Vue-CLI project To use Vuetify with a Vue-CLI project, we need to create a custom Vue-CLI project with pre-defined configurations, so that we are able to take full advantage of the framework and the styling options it provides:  Chapter 9  1.  We need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vue-vuetify  2.  First, Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset; select Manually select features using the space bar:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys    default  babel, eslint  ❯ Manually select features  3.  Now Vue-CLI will ask for the features, and you will need to select CSS Pre- processors as an additional feature on top of the default ones:  ? Check the features needed for your project:  Use arrow keys  ❯ Babel   TypeScript   Progressive Web App  PWA  Support   Router   Vuex ❯ CSS Pre-processors ❯ Linter   Formatter   Unit Testing   E2E Testing  4.  Here, Vue-CLI will ask which CSS pre-processor you want to use; select Sass SCSS  with node-sass :  ? Pick a CSS pre-processor  PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules   are supported by default :  Use arrow keys    Sass SCSS  with dart-sass  ❯ Sass SCSS  with node-sass    Less   Stylus  [ 410 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  5.  Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatted. In our case, we will select the ESLint + Airbnb config:  ? Pick a linter   formatter config:  Use arrow keys    ESLint with error prevention only ❯ ESLint + Airbnb config   ESLint + Standard config   ESLint + Prettier  6.  Choose the additional features of the linter  here, Lint and fix on commit :  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  7.  Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration files  here, In dedicated config files :  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  8.  Finally, Vue-CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings for future projects; you will select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create a folder and install the dependencies for you:  ? Save this as a preset for future projects?  y N  n  Adding Vuetify to the Vue-CLI project To use Vuetify in a Vue project, we will use the Vue-CLI plugin installation of the framework:  1.  In the folder that you created your Vue-CLI project in, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue add vuetify  [ 411 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  2.  Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to choose an installation preset. Choose the default preset. Then, Vue-CLI will finish the installation of the framework on the project:  ? Choose a preset:  Use arrow keys  ❯ Default  recommended    Prototype  rapid development    Configure  advanced   3.  After the installation is finished, Vuetify will have configured the files inside your project to load the framework. Now you are ready to use it.  Creating the layout with Vuetify Using Vuetify as the UI framework, we are using the Material Design guide as a base, because by using Material Design, we can follow a design guideline to create our design structure, which will mean a more appealing structure. You can find the Material Design guidelines at https: ​ ​material.​io ​design ​introductiongoals.  Creating the top bar component In this part, we will create the top-bar component that will be used in the layout of our page:  1. 2.  In the src components folder, create a file named TopBar.vue and open it. In the   section of the single file component, we will export a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as TopBar:    export default {   name: 'TopBar', };    [ 412 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  3.  Inside the   section, create a v-app-bar component with the app,  dark, and dense attributes defined as true, and the color attribute defined as primary:  <v-app-bar  color="primary"   app   dark   dense >   4.  Inside the component, create a v-app-bar-nav-icon component with an event listener on the click event, sending an event 'open-drawer' when the button is clicked:  <v-app-bar-nav-icon   @click="$emit 'open-drawer' "  >  5.  Finally, as a sibling of the v-app-bar-nav-icon component, add a v-toolbar- title component with the title of the page or application:   Vue.JS 3 Cookbook - Packt   Creating the drawer menu component Inside a Material Design application, we have a drawer menu that pops up over the page. This menu will be opened when the user clicks on the button we have just created in the TopBar component:  1.  2.  In the src components folder, create a file named DrawerMenu.vue and open it. In the   section of the single file component, we will export a default JavaScript object with three properties:  The name property, defined as DrawerMenu. The props property, defined as a JavaScript object, with a property called value. This property will be another JavaScript object, with the type, required, and default properties. The type property is defined as Boolean, the required property as true, and the default property as false.  [ 413 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  The data property, as a singleton function returning a JavaScript object. This object will have a menu property, which we will define as an array of the menu items that will be used. The array will contain Javascript objects with the name, then link, and icon properties. The first menu item will have name defined as Home, then link defined as , and icon defined as mdi-home. The second menu item will have name defined as Contact, then link defined as , and icon defined as mdi-email. Finally, the third menu item will have name defined as Vuetify, then link defined as , and icon defined as mdi-vuetify:    export default {   name: 'DrawerMenu',   props: {     value: {       type: Boolean,       required: true,       default: false,     },   },   data:    =>  {     menu: [       {         name: 'Home',         link: '',         icon: 'mdi-home',       },       {         name: 'Contact',         link: '',         icon: 'mdi-email',       },       {         name: 'Vuetify',         link: '',         icon: 'mdi-vuetify',       },     ],   } , };    [ 414 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  3.  In the   section, create a v-navigation-drawer component with the value attribute as a variable attribute bound to the value props, the app attribute defined as true, and the event listener on the click event, sending an 'input' event:  <v-navigation-drawer   :value="value"   app   @input="$emit 'input', $event " >   4.  Create a v-list component with the dense attribute defined as true. As a child element, create a v-list-item component and define the following:  The v-for directive iterating over the menu items. The key attribute with index of the item menu. The link attribute defined as true. Inside v-list-item, create v-list-item-action with a VIcon child, with the inner text as item.icon. Create, as a sibling of v-list-item-action, a v-list-item- content component with v-list-item-title as a child element, with item.name as the inner text:      <v-list-item     v-for=" item, index  in menu"     :key="index"     link>              {{ item.icon }}                     {{ item.name }}< v-list-item-                                                  title>              [ 415 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks Creating the layout component To create the layout component, we are going to use all the created components and add a slot that will hold the page content:  Chapter 9  1.  2.  In the src components folder, create a new file named Layout.vue and open it. In the   section of the single file component, import the top- bar component and the drawer-menu component:  import TopBar from '. TopBar.vue'; import DrawerMenu from '. DrawerMenu.vue';  3.  Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as Layout, then create the components property with the imported components. Finally, add the data property as a singleton function returning a JavaScript object, with the drawer property with the value defined as false:  export default {   name: 'Layout',   components: {     DrawerMenu,     TopBar,   },   data:    =>  {     drawer: false,   } , };  4.  Inside the   section, create a v-app component. As the first child, add the top-bar component, with the event listener on the open-drawer event listener, changing the drawer data property as the negation of the drawer property. Then, as a sibling of top-bar, create a drawer-menu component with the v-model directive bound to drawer. Finally, create a v- content component with a child   element:            <top-bar       @open-drawer="drawer = !drawer"      >     <drawer-menu       v-model="drawer"      >  [ 416 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9                             Creating the user registration form with Vuetify Now, with the layout component ready, we will create the user registration form. Because Vuetify has built-in validation in forms, we will be using that to validate some fields in our form.  Single ﬁle component   section Here, we will create the   section of the single file component:  1. 2.  In the src folder, open the App.vue file and clear its contents. Import the layout component:  import Layout from '. components Layout.vue';  3.  Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with a name property defined as App, then define the components property with the imported component. Define the computed and methods properties as an empty JavaScript object. Then create a data property defined as a singleton function returning a JavaScript object. In the data property, create the following:  A valid property with the value defined as false; A name, username, password, email, phone, cellphone, address, zipcode, and country properties defined as empty strings:  export default {   name: 'App',    components: {     Layout,   },    data:    =>  {     valid: true,     name: '',     username: '',     password: '',     email: '',  [ 417 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9      phone: '',     cellphone: '',     address: '',     zipcode: '',     country: '',   } ,   computed: {},   methods: {}, };  4.  In the computed property, create a property called nameRules; this property is a function that returns an array, with an anonymous function that receives a value and returns the verification of the value or the error text. Do the same for the passwordRules and emailRules properties. In the emailRules property, add another anonymous function to the returned array that checks whether the value is a valid email through a regular expression, and if the value is not a valid email it returns the error message:  computed: {   nameRules   {     return [        v  => !!v  'Name is required',     ];   },   passwordRules   {     return [        v  => !!v  'Password is required',     ];   },   emailRules   {     return [        v  => !!v  'E-mail is required',        v  =>  .+@.+\..+ .test v   'E-mail must be valid',     ];   }, },  5.  Finally, inside the methods property, create a new property named register that is a function that calls the $refs.form.validate function. Also, create another property named cancel that is another function that calls the $refs.form.reset function:  methods: {   register   {     this.$refs.form.validate  ;   },  [ 418 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9    cancel   {     this.$refs.form.reset  ;   }, },  Single ﬁle component   section It's time to create the   section of the single file component:  1. 2.  In the src folder, open the App.vue file. In the   section, create a layout component element, and add a v- container component as a child with the fluid attribute defined as true:  3.  Inside the v-container component, create a child HTML h1 element with the page title and a sibling v-subheader component with the page description:   user Registration   Main user registration form   4.  After that, create a v-form component with the ref attribute defined as form and the lazy-validation attribute as true. Then, the v-model directive of the component gets bound to the valid variable. Create a child v-container component with the fluid attribute defined as true:      <v-container     fluid   >        <v-form   ref="form"   v-model="valid"   lazy-validation >   <v-container     fluid   >        [ 419 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  5.  Inside the v-container component, create a v-row component, and then add a v-col component as a child with the cols attribute defined as 12. Inside the v- col component, create a v-card component with the outlined attribute and flat defined as true, and class defined as mx-auto:  6.  As a child element of the v-card component, create a v-card-title component with the card title, then as a sibling element create a v-divider component. After that, create a v-container element with the fluid attribute defined as true. Inside the v-container element, create a child v-row component:      <v-col     cols="12"   >     <v-card       outlined       flat       class="mx-auto"     >                  Personal Information     <v-container   fluid >            [ 420 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  7.  Inside the v-row component, create a child v-col element with the cols attribute defined as 12. Then inside the v-col component, create v- text-field with the v-model directive bound to the name variable, the rules variable attribute defined as the nameRules computed property, the label attribute defined as Name, and finally, the required attribute defined as true:  8.  As a sibling of the v-col component, create another v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 12. Then, add the v-text-field component as a child, with the v-model directive bound to the email variable, the rules variable attribute defined as the emailRules computed property, the type attribute as email, the label attribute as E-mail, and finally, the required attribute defined as true:  <v-col   cols="12" >   <v-text-field     v-model="name"     :rules="nameRules"     label="Name"     required    >    <v-col   cols="12" >   <v-text-field     v-model="email"     :rules="emailRules"     type="email"     label="E-mail"     required    >    [ 421 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  9.  Create a v-col component as a sibling of the v-col component, and define the cols attribute as 6. Then, add as a child component the v-text-field component, with the v-model directive bound to the phone variable and the label attribute defined as Phone. Do the same for the Cellphone input; you must change the v-model directive bound to the cellphone variable and the label to Cellphone:  <v-col   cols="6" >   <v-text-field     v-model="phone"     label="Phone"    >   <v-col   cols="6" >   <v-text-field     v-model="cellphone"     label="Cellphone"    >    <v-col   cols="12" >   <v-card     outlined     flat     class="mx-auto"   >             Address        [ 422 ]  10.  Now we will create the Address card, as a sibling of v-col in the v-row component. Create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 12. Inside the v-col component, create a v-card component with the outlined attribute and flat defined as true, and class defined as mx-auto. As a child element of the v-card component, create a v-card- title component with the card title; then, as a sibling element, create a v- divider component. After that, create a v-container element with the fluid attribute defined as true. Inside the v-container element, create a child v-row component:   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  11.  Inside the v-row component in the v-container component, create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 12. Then, add  v-text-field as a child component with the v-model directive bound to the address variable and the label attribute defined as Address:  12.  As a sibling element, create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 6. Add a v-text-field component as a child. Define the v-model directive of the v-text-field component bound to the zipcode variable and the label attribute defined as Zipcode:            <v-container       fluid     >                              <v-col   cols="12" >   <v-text-field     v-model="address"     label="Address"    >    <v-col   cols="6" >   <v-text-field     v-model="zipcode"     label="Zipcode"    >    [ 423 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  13.  Then, create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 6. Add a v- text-field component as a child with the v-model directive bound to the country variable and the label attribute defined as Country:  14.  Now we will create the user Information card as a sibling of v-col in the v- row component. Create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 12. Inside the v-col component, create a v-card component with the outlined attribute and flat defined as true, and class defined as mx-auto. As a child element of the v-card component, create a v-card- title component with the card title; then, as a sibling element, create a v- divider component. After that, create a v-container element with the fluid attribute defined as true. Inside the v-container element, create a child v-row component:  <v-col   cols="6" >   <v-text-field     v-model="country"     label="Country"    >    <v-col   cols="12" >   <v-card     outlined     flat     class="mx-auto"   >             user Information                 <v-container       fluid     >                              [ 424 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  15.  Inside the v-row component in the v-container component, create a v- col component with the cols attribute defined as 6. Then, add  v-text- field as a child component with the v-model directive bound to the username variable and the label attribute defined as username:  16.  As a sibling create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 6, and add a v-text-field component as a child with the v-model directive bound to the password variable, the rules variable attribute defined as the passwordRules computed property, and the label attribute defined as Password:  <v-col   cols="6" >   <v-text-field     v-model="username"     label="username"    >    <v-col   cols="6" >   <v-text-field     v-model="password"     :rules="passwordRules"     label="Password"     type="password"     required    >    17.  Now we will create the action buttons. As a sibling of the v-col on the top v- row component, create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 12 and the class attribute defined as text-right. Inside the v-col component, create a v-btn component with the color attribute defined as error, the class attribute as mr-4, and the click event listener attached to the cancel method. Finally, create a v-btn component as a sibling, with the disabled variable attribute as the negation of the valid variable, the color attribute as success, the class attribute as mr-4, and the  click event listener attached to the register method:  <v-col   cols="12"   class="text-right"  [ 425 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  >   <v-btn     color="error"     class="mr-4"     @click="cancel"   >     Cancel       <v-btn     :disabled="!valid"     color="success"     class="mr-4"     @click="register"   >     Register        How it works... In this recipe, we learned how to create a user registration page with Vuetify and Vue-CLI. To create this page, we first needed to create the project using the Vue-CLI tool and then add the Vuetify plugin to it, so that the framework was available to be used.  Then, we created the top-bar component, which holds the application title and the menu button toggle. To use the menu, we created the drawer-menu component to hold the navigation items. Finally, we created the layout component to hold together the top-bar and drawer-menu components and added a   component to place the page content.  For the user registration form page, we created three cards that hold the input forms, which were bound to the variables on the component. Some of the inputs on the form are attached to a set of validation rules that checks for required fields and email validation.  Finally, the user registration form is checked to see whether it's valid before sending the data to the server.

Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Ant-Design The Ant-Design framework was created by the AliBaba group, specifically by the tech team behind AliPay and Ant Financial. It's an ecosystem design that is being mainly used by Asian tech giants and it has a large presence in the React and Vue communities. Focused on the back office UI, the main core of the framework is its solutions for custom data inputs and data tables.  Here, we will learn how to create a user registration form using the Ant-Design and Vue, by creating a top bar component, a drawer menu, a layout wrapper, and a user registration page with a form.  Getting ready The pre-requisites for this recipe are as follows:  Node.js 12+ A Vue-CLI project  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  How to do it... In this recipe, we will create a user registration form using the Ant-Design framework. To do so, we will create a layout wrapper and the components needed for the wrapper, and finally, we will create the page that will hold the user registration form.  [ 428 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks Creating the Vue-CLI project We need to create a Vue-CLI project to be able to install the Ant-Design plugin and start developing the user registration form:  Chapter 9  1.  We need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create antd-vue  2.  First, Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset; select Manually select features using the space bar:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys    default  babel, eslint  ❯ Manually select features  3.  Now Vue-CLI will ask for the features, and you will need to select CSS Pre- processors as an additional feature on top of the default ones:  ? Check the features needed for your project:  Use arrow keys  ❯ Babel   TypeScript   Progressive Web App  PWA  Support   Router   Vuex ❯ CSS Pre-processors ❯ Linter   Formatter   Unit Testing   E2E Testing  4.  Here, Vue-CLI will ask which CSS pre-processor you want to use; select Less:  ? Pick a CSS pre-processor  PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules   are supported by default :  Use arrow keys    Sass SCSS  with dart-sass    Sass SCSS  with node-sass  ❯ Less   Stylus  5.  Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatted. In our case, we will select ESLint + Airbnb config:  ? Pick a linter   formatter config:  Use arrow keys    ESLint with error prevention only ❯ ESLint + Airbnb config  [ 429 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9    ESLint + Standard config   ESLint + Prettier  6.  Choose the additional features of the linter  here, Lint on save :  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  7.  Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration files  here, In dedicated config files :  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use   arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  8.  Finally, the CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings for future projects; you should select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create a folder and install the dependencies for you:  ? Save this as a preset for future projects?  y N  n  Adding Ant-Design to the Vue-CLI project To add the Ant-Design framework to a Vue-CLI project, we need to use the Vue-CLI plugin to install the framework as a project dependency and have it available in the global scope of the application:  1.  In the folder that you created your Vue-CLI project in, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue add ant-design  2.  Vue-CLI will ask you how the import of the Ant-Design component should occur; we will select the Fully import option:  ? How do you want to import Ant-Design-Vue? ❯ Fully import   Import on demand  [ 430 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  3.  Vue-CLI will ask you whether you want to overwrite the Ant-Design LESS variables; we will choose N:  ? Do you wish to overwrite Ant-Design-Vue's LESS variables?  y N   4.  Finally, Vue-CLI will ask about the main language Ant-Design will use in the project; we will select en_US:  ? Choose the locale you want to load ❯ en_US   zh_CN   zh_TW   en_GB   es_ES   ar_EG   bg_BG  Move up and down to reveal more choices   Creating the layout with Ant-Design To be able to create a user registration form, we will create a base layout that will wrap the page content and the form. Here, we will create the top-bar component, the drawer- menu component, and the layout wrapper.  Creating the top-bar component In the layout wrapper, we will have a top-bar component that will hold the breadcrumbs for where the user currently is. Now we will create the top-bar component and make it available for the layout:  1. 2.  In the src components folder, create a new file called TopBar.vue and open it. In the   section of the single file component, we will export a default JavaScript object, with a name property defined as TopBar:    export default {   name: 'TopBar', };    [ 431 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  3.  In the   section of the single file component, we will make the   section scoped and create a class named header-bread. Now, background- color will be defined as f0f2f5 with a class named bread-menu with the margin defined as 16px 0:      .header-bread {     background-color: f0f2f5;   }    .bread-menu {     margin: 16px 0;   }    4.  In the   section of the single file component, we will create an a- layout-component component with the class attribute defined as header- bread. Also, add an a-breadcrumb component as a child element with the class attribute as bread-menu:                           5.  As a child of the a-breadcrumb component, create two a-breadcrumb-item components and add to each the directions for the user's location. In our case, the first one will be user and the second Registration Form:   user   Registration Form   Creating the drawer menu In the layout design, we will have a drawer menu component as a navigation menu for the user. Here we will create the Drawer component:  1.  In the src components folder, create a file named Drawer.vue and open it.  [ 432 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  2.  In the   section of the single file component, we will export a default JavaScript object with two properties. The name property, defined as Drawer, and the data property, as a singleton function returning a JavaScript object. In the data property, create the following: A drawer property defined as false. A menu property, which we will define as an array of the menu items that will be used. The menu array will have three JavaScript objects with the name and icon properties. This array will have:  A JavaScript object with the properties name defined as Home and icon defined as home A JavaScript object with the properties name defined as Ant Design Vue and icon defined as ant-design A JavaScript object with the properties name defined as Contact and icon defined as mail:    export default {   name: 'Drawer',   data:    =>  {     drawer: false,     menu: [       {         name: 'Home',         icon: 'home',       },       {         name: 'Ant Design Vue',         icon: 'ant-design',       },       {         name: 'Contact',         icon: 'mail',       },     ],   } , };    [ 433 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  3.  In the   section of the single file component, create an a-layout- sider component, with the v-model directive bound to the drawer variable and the collapsible attribute defined as true. As a child, create a a-menu component with the default-selected-keys variable attribute defined as ['1'], the theme attribute defined as dark, and the mode attribute as inline:      <a-layout-sider     v-model="drawer"     collapsible   >     <a-menu       :default-selected-keys="['1']"       theme="dark"       mode="inline"     >              <a-menu-item   v-for=" item,index  in menu"   :key="index" >   <a-icon     :type="item.icon"    >    {{ item.name }}     4.  Finally, inside the a-menu component, create an a-menu-item component, with the v-for directive iterating over the menu variable, and create the item and index temporary variables. Then, define the key variable attribute as index. Create a child AIcon component with the type variable attribute as item.icon with a sibling span HTML element and the content as item.name:  Creating the layout component Here, we will create the layout component. This component will join together the top- bar component and the Drawer menu component to make a wrapper for the user registration page:  1.  In the src components folder, create a new file named Layout.vue and open it.  [ 434 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  2.  In the   section of the single file component, import the top- bar component and the drawer-menu component:  import TopBar from '. TopBar.vue'; import Drawer from '. Drawer.vue';  3.  Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with a name property, defined as layout. Then define the components property with the imported components.   export default {   name: 'layout',   components: {     Drawer,     TopBar,   }, };  4.  In the   section of the single file component, create an a-layout component with the style attribute defined as min-height: 100vh. Then, add the Drawer component as a child. As a sibling of the drawer component, create an a-layout component:      <a-layout     style="min-height: 100vh"   >                                     <div style="padding: 24px; background: fff;             min-height: auto;">                                               Vue.js 3 Cookbook  Ant Design  2020 Created by Ant UED                      [ 435 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  5.  To the a-layout component, add the top-bar component and a sibling a- layout-content component with the style attribute defined as margin: 0 16px. As a child of that component, create a div HTML element with the style attribute defined as padding: 24px; background: fff; min-height: auto;, and add a slot placeholder. Finally, create an a-layout-footer component with the style attribute defined as text-align:center; with the footer text of the page:                          Vue.js 3 Cookbook  Ant Design  2020 Created by Ant UED    Creating the user registration form with Ant-Design Now we will create the user registration page and form that will be placed inside the layout that was created in the preceding steps.  Single ﬁle component   section Here we will create the   section of the single file component:  1. 2.  In the src folder, open the App.vue file and clear its contents. Import the layout component:  import Layout from '. components Layout.vue';  3.  Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as App, define the components property with the imported component, and finally define the data property as a singleton function returning a JavaScript object. In the data property, create the following:  A labelCol property defined as a JavaScript object, with the span property and the value 4.  [ 436 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  A wrapperCol property defined as a JavaScript object, with the span property and the value 14. A form property defined as a JavaScript object, with the name, username, password, email, phone, cellphone, address, zipcode, and country properties all defined as empty strings:  export default {   name: 'App',   components: {     Layout,   },   data   {     return {       labelCol: { span: 4 },       wrapperCol: { span: 14 },       form: {         name: '',         username: '',         password: '',         email: '',         phone: '',         cellphone: '',         address: '',         zipcode: '',         country: '',       },     };   }, };  Single ﬁle component   section It's time to create the   section of the single file component:  1. 2.  In the src folder, open the App.vue file. In the   section, create a layout component element and add an a- form-model component as a child with the model variable attribute bound to form, the label-col variable attribute bound to labelCol, and the wrapper- col variable attribute bound to wrapperCol:      <a-form-model     :model="form"     :label-col="labelCol"     :wrapper-col="wrapperCol"  [ 437 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9    >        3.  Then, as a sibling of the layout component, create an h1 HTML element with the page title User Registration, and a p HTML element with the Main user registration form page subtitle. Then, create an a-card element with the title attribute defined as Personal Information:      User Registration    Main user registration form      4.  In the a-card component, create an a-form-model-item component as a child element with the label attribute defined as Name, and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive bound to the form.name variable:           5.  Next, as a sibling, create an a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined as Email and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive bound to the form.email variable and the type attribute defined as email:      <a-input     v-model="form.email"     type="email"    >    6.  Create an element an a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined as Phone, and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive bound to the form.phone variable:           [ 438 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  7.  Create an a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined as Cellphone, and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive bound to the form.cellphone variable:           8.  As a sibling of the a-card component, create an a-card component with the title attribute defined as Address and the style attribute as margin-top: 16px;. Then, add a child a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined as Address, and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive bound to the form.address variable:                     9.  Next, as a sibling of the a-card component, create an a-form-model- item component with the label attribute defined as Zipcode, and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive bound to the form.zipcode variable:           10.  Create an a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined as Country, and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive bound to the form.country variable:           [ 439 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks  Chapter 9  11.  As a sibling of the a-card component, create an a-card component with the title attribute defined as User Information and the style attribute as margin-top: 16px;. Then, add a child a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined as username, and add a child a- input component with the v-model directive bound to the form.username variable:                     12.  Create an a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined as Password, and add a child a-input-password component with the v- model directive bound to the form.password variable, the visibility- toggle attribute defined as true, and the type attribute defined as password:      <a-input-password     v-model="form.password"     visibility-toggle     type="password"    >    13.  Finally, as a sibling of the a-card component, create a-form-model-item with the wrapper-col variable attribute defined as a JavaScript object, {span: 14, offset: 4}. Then, add a child a-button with type defined as primary with the text Create and another a-button with the style attribute defined as margin-left: 10px; and the text Cancel:            Create             Cancel        [ 440 ]   Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks How it works... In this recipe, we learned how to create a user registration page with Ant-Design and Vue- CLI. To create this page, we first needed to create a project using Vue-CLI and add the Ant- Design of Vue plugin to it, so that the framework was available to be used.  Chapter 9  Then, we created the top-bar component, which holds the navigation breadcrumbs. For  user navigation, we created a custom Drawer component that has an inline toggle button at the bottom. Finally, we created the layout component to hold together both the components and we added a   component to place the page content.  Finally, we created the user registration form page, with three cards that hold the input forms that are bound to the variables on the component.

Preparing your application for deployment in Netlify To start the deployment process, we need to configure our project to have a valid Netlify deployment schema. In this recipe, you will learn how to set up the Netlify deployment schema on any Vue-based application.  Getting ready The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:  Node.js 12+ A Vue project  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  [ 447 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms How to do it... In this recipe, we will learn how to prepare our application to be deployed to Netlify:  Chapter 10  1.  Open your Vue project and open the package.json file. Check whether you have the build script defined, as in the following example:  "scripts": {   "serve": "Vue-CLI-service serve",   "build": "Vue-CLI-service build",   "lint": "Vue-CLI-service lint" },  2.  Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm run build  3. 4.  Make sure your application build script creates a dist folder in the main folder. If your vue-router is defined to work with history mode, you have to create a _redirects file in the public folder. In this file, you need to add the instruction to the Netlify router:   Netlify settings for single-page application  *     index.html   200  5.  Publish your application to a GitHub repository. Don't worry about the build folder, because it's already declared on the .gitignore file and it won't be sent to your repository.  How it works... In this recipe, we learned how to check and prepare our application for the Netlify deployment.  To make the deployment work, we needed to make sure that we have the build command in the script section at package.json, and verify that the build destination is the dist folder.  Finally, we created a _redirects file in the public folder to instruct the Netlify router to understand the vue-router history mode.

Getting ready The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:  A Netlify account A Vue project A GitHub account  How to do it... Finally, following the creation of your Netlify account, having published your project on a GitHub repository, and having configured everything, it's time to prepare the Netlify platform to perform automatic deployment on each GitHub push:  1.  2.  3.  Go to Netlify  https: ​ ​www.​netlify.​com ​ , sign in, and open your initial dashboard. There, you will find a New site from Git button. You will be redirected to the Create new site page. Now you may click on the GitHub button to open a new window for the Netlify authorization on GitHub and continue the process there. Sign in with your GitHub account and then you will be redirected to the Application install page.  [ 449 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms  Chapter 10  4.  5.  6.  7.  On this page, you can choose to give access to Netlify to all of your repositories or just the selected one, but make sure you make available the repository of your application. When you finish the installation of Netlify on GitHub, the repository that you gave access to in the previous step will be available to be selected on the Netlify platform. Choose the one that contains your application. To finish the creation process, you need to select the branch that will be used for auto-deployment. Then, you need to fill up the build command used on the application, in our case, npm run build. Open the folder that will contain the built files, in our case, this is the dist folder, and click on the Deploy site button. Finally, the Netlify-CLI will start the building process and publish your application when the build is finished without any errors.  How it works... The Netlify platform connects to your GitHub account and installs as an application, giving access to selected repositories. Then, on the platform, you can select the repository that you want to use to deploy. With the repository selected, we needed to configure the Netlify-CLI with the build instructions and the built destination folder. Finally, the CLI runs, and we  have our application up and running on the web.

Here, you have the option to select one of these repository managers – GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. We will continue by clicking on the GitHub button. After choosing the sign-up method, you will be redirected to the authorization page. On this page, you are giving access to the Vercel platform to access the information on your account. By clicking on the Authorize button, you will be redirected back to the Vercel dashboard. Finally, you have your Vercel account created and ready to be used.  How it works... In this recipe, we entered the Vercel platform, and signed up to it using a repository manager. We were able to create our account, and can now start the deployment process on the platform through repository integration or the CLI tool.

[ 451 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms  Chapter 10  Configuring the Vercel-CLI and deploying your project You have created a Vercel account. Now it's time to configure the Vercel-CLI on your project, so it's available on the Vercel platform and on the web.  Getting ready The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:  A Vercel account A Vue project Node.js 12+  @vue cli-service-global  @vue cli  vercel  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  To install vercel, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm i -g vercel  How to do it... In this recipe, we will learn how to link our project to the Vercel platform through the Vercel-CLI and then deploy the platform with it:  1.  Open your Vue project and then open the package.json file. Check whether you have the build script defined, as in the following example:  "scripts": {   "serve": "Vue-CLI-service serve",   "build": "Vue-CLI-service build",   "lint": "Vue-CLI-service lint" },  [ 452 ]  2.  Make sure your application build script creates a dist folder in the main folder.   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms  Chapter 10  3.  In your project folder, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vercel  This will prompt you for a login to the Vercel platform:  > No existing credentials found. Please log in:   Enter your email:  4.  5.  6.  Enter the email address that is linked to the repository manager that you have used to sign in to Vercel. You will receive an email with a Verify button; click on it to verify your email address: Once your email is verified, you are able to deploy applications in your Terminal with the > vercel command. To deploy your application to the web, we need to execute the > vercel command in the project folder, and it will ask some questions about the project settings prior to deployment. The first question will relate to the project path:  ? Set up and deploy "~ Versionamento Vue.js-3.0-Cookbook chapter-    14 14.5"? [Y n] y  7.  Now it will ask for the scope that will deploy the project. This is used when you have multiple account access options defined under the same username. In most of the scenarios, it will only have one, and you can press Enter:  ? Set up and deploy "~ Versionamento Vue.js-3.0-Cookbook chapter-    14 14.5"? y ? Which scope do you want to deploy to? ❯ Heitor Ramon Ribeiro  8.  Then, it will ask to link to an existing project on Vercel. In our case, this is a brand new project, so we will choose n:  ? Link to existing project? [Y n] n  9.  You will be asked to define the project's name  only lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed :  ? What's your project's name? vuejscookbook-12-5  10.  You now need to define the location of the source code of the project. This location is where the package.json file is located; in our case, this will be the .  folder, or the main project folder:  ? In which directory is your code located? .   [ 453 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms  Chapter 10  11.  Vercel-CLI will detect that the project is a Vue-CLI project, and will automatically define all the commands and directory settings for the deployment of the application. We will choose n in our case:  Auto-detected Project Settings  Vue.js : - Build Command: `npm run build` or `Vue-CLI-service build` - Output Directory: dist - Development Command: Vue-CLI-service serve --port $PORT ? Want to override the settings? [y N] n  12.  Once everything is set up, the CLI will deploy the first preview of your application, and you will receive a link to access the preview of your application. To deploy your application as production-ready, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:   > vercel --prod  How it works... In this recipe, we learned how to connect the Vercel-CLI to the online platform with the email address that is linked to the repository manager, and set up project deployment.  In this process, we learned how to configure the advanced options of the CLI by defining the project settings for the build commands, distribution folder, and development command.  Finally, we were able to get the preview URL of our project before deploying it to production.

[ 454 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms  Chapter 10  Preparing for automatic deployment on Vercel with GitHub We learned in the previous recipe how to use the Vercel-CLI to deploy our application to the web using your local terminal, but it is possible to integrate the repository manager with the Vercel platform and deploy automatically through any push or open pull requests. That's what we will do in this recipe.  Getting ready The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:  A Vercel account A Vue project on a repository manager  How to do it... In this recipe, we will learn how to integrate the Vercel platform with the repository manager and make an automatic deployment:  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  Open your Vercel dashboard  https: ​ ​vercel.​com ​dashboard  and click on the Import Project button. On the Import Project page, click on the Continue button inside the From Git Repository card. Now, the Vercel website will ask whether the user who holds the repository of the project you are importing is your personal account. Click Yes if it is. If it isn't, Vercel will fork the project into your personal account before starting the process. Then, Vercel will ask which account you want to bind the project to. In our case, this will be our personal account. Select it, and click on the Continue button. You will be redirected to the GitHub web page, to give Vercel access to your repositories. You can give access to all your repositories, or just the ones you want to deploy. In our case, we will give access to all the repositories on our account.  [ 455 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms  Chapter 10  6.  7.  After installing the Vercel application on your GitHub account, you will be sent back to the Vercel web page. Here, you can define the settings for the project you are creating, including the project name, the preset you are using, build instructions, and environment variables. Vercel will automatically detect that our project is a Vue-CLI project and will configure the build and deployment settings for us. Then, click on the Deploy button to continue. Vercel will start the first deployment process. When it's finished, Vercel will give you the link for the application, along with a link for you to open the dashboard.  How it works... The Vercel platform connects to your GitHub account and installs as an application, giving access to selected repositories. Then, on the platform, you can select the repository that you want to use to deploy.  With the repository selected, you need to configure the Vercel-CLI with the build instructions and the built destination folder.  Finally, the CLI runs, and we have our application up and running on the web.

Creating a Firebase project Firebase is an all-in-one solution created by Google to help developers with dedicated tools for analytics, notifications, machine learning, and cloud solutions. One of the cloud solutions they provide is the hosting platform.   With the hosting platform, we are able to host our single-page applications in the Google cloud servers and have them available to everyone, through a global content delivery network.  [ 456 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms Getting ready The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:  A Google account A Vue project  Chapter 10  How to do it... In this recipe, we will learn how to create our Firebase project so that we can deploy our application to the Firebase hosting:  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  Open the Firebase home page  https: ​ ​firebase.​google.​com ​  and click on the Sign In link in the header menu. If you are already logged in to your Google account, click on the Go to console link. On the Console page, click on the Create a project button to create a new Firebase project.  Firebase will ask for the project name  you can only use alphanumeric characters and spaces . Then, Firebase will ask whether you want to enable Google Analytics in this project. In our case, we will disable this option. Finally, you will be redirected to the project overview dashboard.  How it works... In this recipe, we created our first Firebase project. To do it, we started by signing in to our Google account and going to the Firebase console. On the Firebase console, we created a new project, and in the setup wizard steps, we disabled the Google Analytics options because we won't be using attached analytics in this recipe. Finally, when we finished the setup wizard, our project was ready.  See also Find out more information about Google Firebase at https: ​ ​firebase.​google.​com.  [ 457 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms  Chapter 10  Configuring the Firebase-CLI and deploying your project To deploy our application to Firebase Hosting, we need to use the Firebase-CLI. The CLI will help with the process of packing the files and sending them to the Google Cloud server.  In this recipe, we will learn how to configure the Firebase-CLI to deploy your application to the web using your local terminal.  Getting ready The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:  A Google account A Vue project A Firebase project Node.js 12+  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  firebase-tools  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  To install firebase-tools, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > npm install -g firebase-tools  [ 458 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms How to do it... In this recipe, we will learn how to set up the Firebase-CLI on our project, and how to initialize it with our project created during the previous recipe:  Chapter 10  1.  Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command on the root folder of your project:  2.  3.  4.  > firebase login  The Firebase-CLI will open a browser window so you can log in to your Google account, and give access on the part of the Firebase-CLI to your Google Account.  If the browser doesn't open automatically, a link will appear on the Firebase-CLI, copy the link, and then paste it into your browser to continue.  Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command on the root folder of your project:  > firebase init  Now we are initializing the configuration process of the CLI with our project. For the first question of the CLI, we are going to use just the Hosting feature, so we need to select just Hosting:  ? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up     for this folder?   Press space to select feature, then Enter to confirm     your choices.    Database: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database Rules    Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes for Firestore    Functions: Configure and deploy Cloud Functions ❯  Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites    Storage: Deploy Cloud Storage security rules    Emulators: Set up local emulators for Firebase features  5.  Then, the CLI will ask which Firebase project we want to use. In our case, we created the project earlier in the previous recipe, so we will select Use an existing project:  ? Use an existing project ❯ Use an existing project   Create a new project   Add Firebase to an existing Google Cloud Platform project   Don't set up a default project  [ 459 ]   Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms  Chapter 10  6.

Select a default Firebase project for this directory:  Use arrow    keys  ❯ vue-3-cookbook-firebase-18921  Vue 3 Cookbook Firebase   7.  The CLI will ask about the public directory of the application, or in our case, because it's a single-page application, we need to use the build destination folder. Type the name of the destination folder, in our case it's dist:  ? What do you want to use as your project public directory? dist  8.  Finally, the last step in the process is to select whether we want to use the configuration as a single-page application. Type y to enable rewrites of all the URLs to index.html so we can use the history mode of vue-router:  ? Configure as a single-page app  rewrite all urls to  index.html ?    y N  y  9.  Open the package.json file on the root directory of your project, and add a new script to automate the build and deployment process:  "scripts": {   "serve": "Vue-CLI-service serve",   "build": "Vue-CLI-service build",   "deploy": "npm run build && firebase deploy",   "lint": "Vue-CLI-service lint" },  10.

[ 461 ]   11  Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Now you are in the Pro League! You are an advanced Vue developer. Let's have some fun and check out some great recipes that are custom made for you! Here are some hand- picked optimization solutions that can improve the quality of your Vue application and make your life easier.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:  Automatically loading vue-router routes Automatically loading vuex modules Creating a custom directive Creating a Vue plugin Creating an SSR, SPA, PWA, Cordova, and Electron application in Vue with Quasar Creating smarter Vue watchers and computed properties Creating a Nuxt.js SSR with Python Flask as the API The dos and don'ts of Vue applications  Technical requirements In this chapter, we will be using Node.js, Vue-CLI, Cordova, Electron, Quasar, Nuxt.js, and Python.    Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  Attention Windows users: you are required to install an npm package called windows-build-tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do so, open PowerShell as an Administrator and execute the following command:  > npm install -g windows-build-tools  To install Vue-CLI, you need to execute the following command in Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows :  > npm install -g @vue cli @vue cli-service-global  To install Cordova, you need to execute the following command in Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows :  > npm install -g cordova  If you are running on a macOS and you want to run an iOS simulator, you need to execute the following command in Terminal  macOS :  > npm install -g ios-sim ios-deploy  To install Electron, you need to execute the following command in Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows :  > npm install -g electron  To install Quasar, you need to execute the following command in Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows :  > npm install -g @quasar cli  To install Nuxt.js, you need to execute the following command in Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows :  > npm install -g create-nuxt-app  Automatically loading Vue routes In order to create maintainable code, we can use the strategy of auto-importing files that have the same structure in our project. Like the routes in vue-router, when the application gets larger, we find a huge amount of files being imported and handled manually. In this recipe, we will learn a trick to use the webpack require.context function to automatically inject files for us.  [ 463 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  This function will read the file content and add the routes to an array that will be exported into our file by default. You can improve this recipe by adding a more controlled route import or even environment-based route rules.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  We will need to create a new Vue project with Vue-CLI, or use the project created in previous recipes:  1.

After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  7.  After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to store them is in a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store them in package.json:  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use   arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  8.

Follow these instructions to create an auto-import of the router files in your project that will handle the router files inside a specific folder:  1.  With our route files created and placed inside the routes folder, we need to make sure that every route file has a default export object in it. In the index.js file, inside the src router folder, remove the default array of routes that is present in the file:  2.  Now create an empty array of routes that will be populated by the imported ones from the folder, and start the import. With that, requireRoutes will be an object with the keys being the filename and the values being the ID of the file:  import Vue from 'vue'; import VueRouter from 'vue-router';  Vue.use VueRouter ;  export default new VueRouter {} ;  import Vue from 'vue'; import VueRouter from 'vue-router';  Vue.use VueRouter ;  const routes = []; const requireRoutes = require.context    '. routes',   true,  [ 466 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  3.  To push those files inside the routes array, we need to add the following code and create a folder named routes inside the router folder:     ^ ?!.*test .*\.js$ is,  ;  const router = new VueRouter {   routes, } ;  export default router;  import Vue from 'vue'; import VueRouter from 'vue-router';  Vue.use VueRouter ;  const routes = []; const requireRoutes = require.context    '. routes',   true,    ^ ?!.*test .*\.js$ is,  ;  requireRoutes.keys  .forEach  fileName  => {   routes.push {     ...requireRoutes fileName .default,   } ; } ;  const router = new VueRouter {   routes, } ;  export default router;  Now you have your routes loaded on your application automatically as you create a new .js file inside the routes folder.  How it works... require.context is a webpack built-in function that allows you to pass in a directory to search, a flag indicating whether subdirectories should be examined too, and a regular expression to match files.  [ 467 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  When the building process starts, webpack will search for all the require.context functions and will pre-execute them, so the files needed on the import will be there for the final build.  We pass three arguments to the function: the first is the folder where it will start the search, the second asks whether the search will go to descending folders, and finally, the third is a regular expression for filename matching.  In this recipe, to automatically load the routes as the first argument of the function, we define . routes for the folder. As the second argument of the function, we define false to not search in subdirectories. Finally, as the third argument, we define  ^ ?!.*test .*\.js$ is as the Regex to search for .js files and ignore the files that have .test in their names.  There's more... With this recipe, it's possible to take your application to the next level by using the subdirectories for router modules and environments for router control.  With those increments, the function may be extracted to another file, but in router.js, it still needs to be imported into the main.js file. Or, you can obtain the import function, and pass the array of routes to router.js.

To handle those modules, we always need to import them by creating a file that will have all the files imported and then export those to the Vuex store creation.  [ 468 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  In this recipe, we will learn about a function that uses the webpack require.context function to automatically load and inject those files into the Vuex store creation.

Follow these instructions to create an auto-import of the vuex modules in your project that will handle the router files inside a specific folder:  1.  With our route files created and placed inside the store folder, we need to make sure that every store file has a default export object in it. In the index.js file, inside the src store folder, we will need to extract the array of stores or modules:  import Vue from 'vue'; import Vuex from 'vuex';  Vue.use Vuex ;  export default new Vuex.Store {} ;  2.  Create another file named loader.js in the src store folder  which will be our module loader . It's important to remember that when using this recipe, you will use vuex namespaced because all the stores need to be used as a module and need to be exported in a single JavaScript object. Each filename will be used as a reference to a namespace, and it will be parsed to a camelCase text style:  const toCamel =  s  => s.replace   [-_][a-z]  ig,  c  =>     c.toUpperCase     .replace  [-_] g, ''  ; const requireModule = require.context '. modules ', false,     ^ ?!.*test .*\.js$ is ; const modules = {};  requireModule.keys  .forEach  fileName  => {   const moduleName = toCamel fileName.replace   \.\ \.js  g, ''  ;    modules[moduleName] = {     namespaced: true,  [ 471 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11      ...requireModule fileName .default,   }; } ;  export default modules;  3.  As we will be importing by default each file inside the modules folder, a good practice is to create a file for each module. For example, as you will be creating a module named user, you need to create a file named user.js that imports all the stores actions, mutations, getters, and state. Those can be placed inside a folder that has the same name as the module. The modules folder will have a structure similar to this:  The user.js file inside the src store modules folder will look like this:  import state from '. user state'; import actions from '. user actions'; import mutations from '. user mutations'; import getters from '. user getters';  4.  In the index.js file in the src store folder, we need to add the imported modules that were automatically loaded:  modules ├── user.js ├── user │ └── types.js │   └── state.js │   └── actions.js │   └── mutations.js │   └── getters.js └───────  export default {   state,   actions,   mutations,   getters, };  import Vue from 'vue'; import Vuex from 'vuex'; import modules from '. loader';  Vue.use Vuex ;  export default new Vuex.Store {  [ 472 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11    modules, } ;  Now you have your vuex modules loaded on your application automatically as you create a new .js file inside the src store modules folder.  How it works... require.context is a webpack built-in function that receives a directory to execute a search, a Boolean flag indicating whether subdirectories are included in this search, and a regular expression for the pattern matching for the filename  all as arguments .  When the building process starts, webpack will search for all the require.context functions, and will pre-execute them, so the files needed on the import will be there for the final build.  In our case, we passed . modules for the folder, false to not search in subdirectories, and  ^ ?!.*test .*\.js$ is as the Regex to search for .js files and ignore the files that have .test in their names.  Then, the function will search for the files and will pass the result through a for loop to add the content of the files in the array of vuex modules.

[ 473 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  There are the directives that make the components work with the template engine, which are the binding agents between the data and the visual result. And there are built-in directives in the core of Vue, such as v-if, v-else, and v-for.  In this recipe, we will learn how to make our directive.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  Node.js 12+  The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:  @vue cli  @vue cli-service-global  We will need to create a new Vue project with Vue-CLI, or use the project created in previous recipes:  1.  We need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue create vue-directive  2.  3.  The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue, and the spacebar to select an option.  There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method is a basic babel and eslint project without any plugins or configuration, and the Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins, linters, and options. We will go for Manually:  ? Please pick a preset:  Use arrow keys    default  babel, eslint  ❯ Manually select features ‌  4.  Now we are asked about the features that we want on the project. Those features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Router  vue-router , testers, linters, and more. Select Babel and Linter   Formatter:  ?

After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:  ? Pick additional lint features:  Use arrow keys    Lint on save ❯ Lint and fix on commit  7.  After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to store them is in a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store them in package.json:  ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?  Use arrow keys  ❯ In dedicated config files   In package.json  8.  Now you can choose whether you want to make this selection a preset for future projects so you don't need to reselect everything:  ?

If you want to check the project on vue-ui when the installation has finished, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > vue ui  [ 475 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  Or, you can run the built-in npm commands by opening Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and executing one of the following commands:  npm run serve – To run a development server locally npm run build  – To build and minify the application for deployment npm run lint  – To execute the lint on the code  How to do it... Follow these instructions to create a directive for a masked input field:  1.  2.  Create a file named formMaskInputDirective.js in the src directives folder, and a file named tokens.js in the same folder.  In the tokens.js file, we will add our mask base tokens. Those tokens will be used to identify the kind of value our input will accept:  export default {   "": { pattern:  [\x2A\d]  },   0: { pattern:  \d  },   9: { pattern:  \d  },   X: { pattern:  [0-9a-zA-Z]  },   S: { pattern:  [a-zA-Z]  },   A: { pattern:  [a-zA-Z] , transform: v => v.toLocaleUpperCase   },   a: { pattern:  [a-zA-Z] , transform: v => v.toLocaleLowerCase   },   "!": { escape: true } };  3.  We import the token from token.js and create our functions:  import tokens from '. tokens';  function maskerValue   {      Code will be developed in this recipe }  function eventDispatcher   {      Code will be developed in this recipe }  function maskDirective   {  [ 476 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11      Code will be developed in this recipe }  export default maskDirective;  4.  In the maskDirective function, we will need to check for the binding value on the directive that is passed by the callee of the directive and check whether it's a valid binding. To do so, we will first check whether the value property is present on the binding argument, and then add it to the config variable with the tokens that were imported:  function maskDirective el, binding  {   let config;    if  !binding.value  return false;    if  typeof config === 'string'  {     config = {       mask: binding.value,       tokens,     };   } else {     throw new Error 'Invalid input entered' ;   }  5.  Now we need to check for the element and validate whether it's an input HTML element. To do so, we will check whether the element that was passed down by the directive has a tagName of input, and if it doesn't, we will try to find an input HTML element in the element that was passed down:  let element = el;    if  element.tagName.toLocaleUpperCase   !== 'INPUT'  {     const els = element.getElementsByTagName 'input' ;      if  els.length !== 1  {       throw new Error `v-input-mask directive requires 1 input,          found ${els.length}` ;     } else {       [element] = els;     }   }  [ 477 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  6.  Now we need to add an event listener to the input on the element. The listener will call two external functions, one for dispatching the events and another to return the masked value to the input:  element.oninput =  evt  => {     if  !evt.isTrusted  return;     let position = element.selectionEnd;      const digit = element.value[position - 1];     element.value = maskerValue element.value, config.mask,        config.tokens ;     while         position < element.value.length       && element.value.charAt position - 1  !== digit       {       position += 1;     }     if  element === document.activeElement  {       element.setSelectionRange position, position ;       setTimeout    => {         element.setSelectionRange position, position ;       }, 0 ;     }     element.dispatchEvent eventDispatcher 'input'  ;   };    const newDisplay = maskerValue element.value, config.mask,      config.tokens ;   if  newDisplay !== element.value  {     element.value = newDisplay;     element.dispatchEvent eventDispatcher 'input'  ;   }    return true; }    end of maskDirective function  7.  Let's create the eventDispatcher function; this function will emit the events that will be listened to by the v-on directive:  function eventDispatcher name  {   const evt = document.createEvent 'Event' ;    evt.initEvent name, true, true ;    return evt; }  [ 478 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  8.  And now the complicated part: returning the masked input value to the input. To do so, we will need to create the maskerValue function. This function receives the value, mask, and token as parameters. The function checks for the current value against the mask, to see whether the mask is complete or the value is of a valid token. If everything's okay, it will pass the value to the input:  function maskerValue v, m, tkn  {   const value = v  '';    const mask = m  '';    let maskIndex = 0;    let valueIndex = 0;    let output = '';    while  maskIndex < mask.length && valueIndex < value.length  {     let maskCharacter = mask[maskIndex];     const masker = tkn[maskCharacter];     const valueCharacter = value[valueIndex];      if  masker && !masker.escape  {       if  masker.pattern.test valueCharacter   {         output += masker.transform ?            masker.transform valueCharacter  : valueCharacter;         maskIndex += 1;       }        if  valueCharacter === maskCharacter  valueIndex += 1;        valueIndex += 1;     } else {       if  masker && masker.escape  {         maskIndex += 1;         maskCharacter = mask[maskIndex];       }        output += maskCharacter;        maskIndex += 1;     }   }    let outputRest = '';   while  maskIndex < mask.length  {     const maskCharacter = mask[maskIndex];  [ 479 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11      if  tkn[maskCharacter]  {       outputRest = '';       break;     }      outputRest += maskCharacter;      maskIndex += 1;   }    return output + outputRest; }   end of maskerValue function  9.  With our file ready, we need to import the mask directive in the main.js file and add the directive to Vue, giving the directive the name 'input-mask':  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import InputMaskDirective from '. directives formMaskInputDirective';  Vue.config.productionTip = false;  Vue.directive 'input-mask', InputMaskDirective ;  new Vue {   render:  h  => h App , } .$mount 'app' ;  10.  To use the directive on our application, we need to call the directive on an input HTML element inside a single file component   section, passing the token template '--' in the v-input-mask directive like this:            <input       type="text"       v-input-mask="'--'"       v-model="inputMask"      >          export default {   name: 'app',  [ 480 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11    data:    =>  {     inputMask: '',   } , };    How it works... A Vue directive has five possible hooks. We used just one, bind. It's bound directly to the element and component. It gets three arguments: element, binding, and vnode.  When we add the directive in the main.js file to Vue, we make it available everywhere in our application, so the directive is already at App.vue to be used by the input.  At the same time we call v-input-mask on the input element, we pass the first argument, element, to the directive, and the second argument, binding, is the value of the attribute.  Our directive works by checking each new character value on the input. A Regex test is executed and validates the character to see whether it is a valid character on the token list that was given on the directive instantiation. Then, it returns the character if it passes the test, or returns nothing if it's an invalid character.  Creating a Vue plugin Sometimes a new addition to your application is needed, and this addition needs to be shared. The best way to share it is by using a plugin. In Vue, a plugin is an addition to the Vue global prototype by extending the initialized application with new features such as directives, mixings, filters, prototype injection, or totally new functions.  Now we will learn how to make our plugin, and how we can use it to interact with Vue as a whole  without messing with the prototype and breaking it .

Writing a Vue plugin is simple, and there is no need to learn more about Vue itself. The basic concept of a plugin is an object that needs to have an install function, which will be executed when called by the Vue.use   method. The install function will receive two arguments: Vue, and the options that will be used to instantiate the plugin.  Chapter 11  Follow these instructions to write a plugin that adds two new functions to the Vue global prototype, $localStorage and $sessionStorage:  1.  2.  In our project, we need to create a file inside the src plugin folder named storageManipulator.js. In this file, we will create the plugin installation object – we'll add the default plugin options and the base prototype for the functions:   * eslint no-param-reassign: 0 *   const defaultOption = {   useSaveFunction: true,   useRetrieveFunction: true,   onSave: value => JSON.stringify value ,   onRetrieve: value => JSON.parse value , };  export default {   install Vue, option  {     const baseOptions = {       ...defaultOption,       ...option,     };      Vue.prototype.$localStorage = generateStorageObject         window.localStorage,         baseOptions,        ;    We will add later this code      Vue.prototype.$sessionStorage = generateStorageObject          window.localStorage,         baseOptions,        ;    We will add later this code   }, };  [ 484 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  3.  Now we need to create the generateStorageObject function. This function will receive two arguments: the first will be the window storage object, and the second will be the plugin options. With this, it will be possible to generate the object that will be used on the prototype that will be injected into Vue:  const generateStorageObject =  windowStorage, options  =>  {   set key, value  {     windowStorage.setItem        key,       options.useSaveFunction         ? options.onSave value          : value,      ;   },    get key  {     const item = windowStorage.getItem key ;     return options.useRetrieveFunction ? options.onRetrieve item  :       item;   },    remove key  {     windowStorage.removeItem key ;   },    clear   {     windowStorage.clear  ;   }, } ;  4.  We need to import the plugin into the main.js, and then with the Vue.use function, install the plugin in our Vue application:  import Vue from 'vue'; import App from '. App.vue'; import StorageManipulatorPlugin from '. plugin storageManipulator';  Vue.config.productionTip = false;  Vue.use StorageManipulatorPlugin ;  new Vue {   render: h => h App , } .$mount 'app' ;  Now you can use the plugin anywhere in your Vue application, calling the this.$localStorage method or this.$sessionStorage.  [ 485 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More How it works... The Vue plugin works by adding all the code that was instructed to be used to the Vue application layer  like a mixin .   Chapter 11  When we used Vue.use   to import our plugin, we told Vue to call the install   function on the object of the imported file and executed it. Vue will automatically pass the current Vue as the first argument, and the options  if you declare them  as the second argument.  In our plugin, when the install   function is called, we first create baseOptions, merging the default options with the passed parameter, then we inject two new properties into the Vue prototype. Those properties are now available everywhere because the Vue parameter that was passed is the Vue global being used in the application.  Our generateStorageObject is a pure abstraction of the Storage API of the browser. We use it as a generator for our prototypes inside the plugin.

The CLI can deploy the same code base to different flavors, such as Single-Page Application  SPA , Server-Side Rendering  SSR , Progressive Web Application  PWA , Mobile Application  Cordova , and Desktop Application  Electron .  This takes some of the problems away from the developer, such as configuring webpack, Cordova, and Electron with HMR  Hot Module Reload  for development, or adding an SSR configuration in the SPA project. The framework helps the developer start production as soon as possible.   [ 486 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  In this recipe, we will learn how to use Quasar and the CLI to create a basic project, and how to use the CLI to add the development targets for SPA, PWA, SSR, Mobile Application, and Desktop Application.  Getting ready The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:  The Node.js global object that is required is as follows:  Node.js 12+  @quasar cli  We will need to create a new Quasar project with the Quasar CLI, or use the project created in previous recipes.  To do it, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > quasar create quasar-project  Now, when asked, we need to choose to manually select features:  1.  Quasar-CLI will ask you for a project name. Define your project name. In our case, we choose quasar_project:  > Project name: quasar_project  2.  Then Quasar-CLI will ask for a project product name. This will be used by mobile apps to defined their title name. In our case, we stayed with the default name provided:  > Project product name  must start with letter if building mobile     apps   Quasar App   3.  Now Quasar-CLI will ask for a project description. This is used for a meta tag in search engines when the page is shared. In our case, we used the default description provided:  > Project description:  A Quasar Framework app   [ 487 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  4.  Then Quasar-CLI will ask for the project author. Fill this with a package.json valid name  for example, Heitor Ribeiro  :  > Author:    5.  Now it's time to choose the CSS preprocessor. In our case, we will go with Sass with indented syntax:  Pick your favorite CSS preprocessor:  can be changed later   Use arrow keys  ❯ Sass with indented syntax  recommended    Sass with SCSS syntax  recommended    Stylus   None  the others will still be available   6.  Then Quasar-CLI will ask about the import strategy for the components and directives.

Now we need to choose the extra features for the project. We will select EsLint:  Check the features needed for your project: EsLint  8.  After that, Quasar-CLI will ask for a preset for ESLint. Choose the Airbnb preset:  Pick an ESLint preset: Airbnb  9.  Finally, Quasar-CLI will ask for the application you want to use to install the  dependencies of the project. In our case, we used yarn because we have installed it already  but you can choose the one you prefer :  Continue to install project dependencies after the project has been   created?  recommended   Use arrow keys  ❯ Yes, use Yarn  recommended    Yes, use npm   No, I will handle that myself  Now open the created folder in your IDE or code editor.  [ 488 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More How to do it... When using Quasar to create an application, you always need to choose a flavor to start, but the main code will be an SPA. Therefore, the other flavors will have their special treats and delicacies based on their needs, but you can personalize and make your build execute some code based on the build environment.  Chapter 11  Developing an SPA  Single-Page Application  Starting the development of an SPA is an out-of-the-box solution; there is no need to add any new configuration.  So let's start adding a new page to our application. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > quasar new page About  Quasar-CLI will automatically create the Vue page for us. We need to add the reference to the page in the router file, and the page will be available on the application:  1.  To do it, we need to open the routes.js file in the src router folder, and add the About page:  const routes = [   {     path: ' ',     component:    => import 'layouts MainLayout.vue' ,     children: [       { path: '', name: 'home', component:    =>          import 'pages Index.vue'  },       { path: 'about', name: 'about', component:    =>          import 'pages About.vue'  },     ],   },   {     path: '*',     component:    => import 'pages Error404.vue' ,   } ];  export default routes;  [ 489 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  2.  Then open the About.vue file in the src pages folder. You will find that the file is a single file component that has an empty QPage component in it, so we need to add a basic title and page indication in the   section:  3.  Now, in the MainLayout.vue file, in the src layouts folder, to the q-drawer component, we need to add the links to the Home and About page:    <q-page     padding     class="flex flex-start"   >      About       This is an About Us Page           export default {   name: 'PageAbout', };                                <q-btn flat dense round         @click="leftDrawerOpen = !leftDrawerOpen"         aria-label="Menu">                                            Quasar App                       Quasar v{{ $q.version }}                     <q-drawer v-model="leftDrawerOpen"     bordered content-class="bg-grey-2">                  Menu                         [ 490 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11                                                     Home                                                                                                 About                                                                    export default {   name: "MyLayout",   data   {     return {       leftDrawerOpen: this.$q.platform.is.desktop     };   } };    And we are finished with a simple example of an SPA running inside a Quasar framework.  Commands You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and executing one of the following:  quasar dev – To start development mode  quasar build – To build the SPA  [ 491 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More Developing a PWA  Progressive Web Application  To develop a PWA, we first need to inform Quasar that we want to add a new mode of development. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  Chapter 11  > quasar mode add pwa  Quasar-CLI will create a folder called src-pwa that will have our service-workers files, separated from our main code.  To clean the newly added files, and to lint it into the Airbnb format, we need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > eslint --fix --ext .js . src-pwa  The code that we added to the SPA will still be used as our base so that we can add new pages, components, and other functions to it as well, which will be used on the PWA.  So, are you wondering why service-worker is not in the main src folder? This is because those files are exclusively for PWAs, and are not needed in any other case than this one. The same will happen in different build types, such as Electron, Cordova, and SSR.  Conﬁguring quasar.conf on a PWA For PWA development, you can set some special flags on the quasar.conf.js file in the root folder:  pwa: {      workboxPluginMode: 'InjectManifest',      workboxOptions: {},   manifest: {        ...   },       variables used to inject specific PWA      meta tags  below are default values    metaVariables: {     appleMobileWebAppCapable: 'yes',     appleMobileWebAppStatusBarStyle: 'default',     appleTouchIcon120: 'statics icons apple-icon-120x120.png',     appleTouchIcon180: 'statics icons apple-icon-180x180.png',     appleTouchIcon152: 'statics icons apple-icon-152x152.png',     appleTouchIcon167: 'statics icons apple-icon-167x167.png',  [ 492 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11      appleSafariPinnedTab: 'statics icons safari-pinned-tab.svg',     msapplicationTileImage: 'statics icons ms-icon-144x144.png',     msapplicationTileColor: '000000'   } }  Commands You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and executing one of the following:  quasar dev -m pwa – To start development mode as a PWA quasar build -m pwa – To build the code as a PWA  Developing SSR  Server-Side Rendering  To develop SSR, we first need to inform Quasar that we want to add a new mode of development. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > quasar mode add ssr  Quasar-CLI will create a folder called src-ssr that will have our extension and server starter files, separated from our main code.  The extension file is not transpiled by babel and runs on the Node.js context, so it is the same environment as an Express or Nuxt.js application. You can use server plugins, such as database, fileread, and filewrites.  The server starter files will be our index.js file in the src-ssr folder. As the extension, it is not transpiled by babel and runs on the Node.js context. For the HTTP server, it uses Express, and if you configure quasar.conf.js to pass the client a PWA, you can have an SSR with PWA at the same time.  Conﬁguring quasar.conf on SSR For SSR development, you can configure some special flags on the quasar.conf.js file in the root folder:  ssr: {   pwa: true false,    should a PWA take over  default: false , or just                                                                a SPA? },  [ 493 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More Commands You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and executing one of the following:  Chapter 11  quasar dev -m ssr – To start development mode as SSR quasar build -m ssr – To build the code as SSR quasar serve – To run an HTTP server  can be used in production   Developing a mobile application  Cordova  To develop SSR, we first need to inform Quasar that we want to add a new mode of development. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > quasar mode add cordova  Now the Quasar-CLI will ask you some configuration questions:  1.  What is the Cordova app ID?  org.cordova.quasar.app   2.  May Cordova anonymously report usage statistics to improve the tool over time?  Y N  N  Quasar-CLI will create a folder called src-cordova, which will have a Cordova project inside.  The folder structure of a Cordova project looks like this:  src-cordova  ├── config.xml ├── packages.json ├── cordova-flag.d.ts ├── hooks  ├── www  ├── platforms  ├── plugins   As a separate project inside Quasar, to add Cordova plugins, you need to call plugman or cordova plugin add command inside the src- cordova folder.

Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > quasar mode add electron  Quasar-CLI will create a folder called src-electron, which will have an Electron project inside.  [ 495 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  The folder structure for Electron projects looks like this:  src-electron  ├── icons  ├── main-process  ├── electron-flag.d.ts  Inside the icons folder, you will find the icons that electron-packager will use when building your project. In the main-process folder will be your main Electron files, spliced into two files: one that will only be called on development and another that will be called on development and production.  Conﬁguring quasar.conf on Electron For Electron development, you can set some special flags on the quasar.conf.js file in the root folder:  electron: {      optional; webpack config Object for      the Main Process ONLY   src-electron main-process     extendWebpack  cfg  {        directly change props of cfg;        no need to return anything   },       optional; EQUIVALENT to extendWebpack   but uses webpack-chain;      for the Main Process ONLY   src-electron main-process     chainWebpack  chain  {        chain is a webpack-chain instance        of the Webpack configuration   },    bundler: 'packager',    or 'builder'       electron-packager options   packager: {       ...   },       electron-builder options   builder: {       ...   } },  [ 496 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  The packager key uses the API options for the electron-packager module, and the builder key uses the API options for the electron- builder module.  Commands You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and executing one of the following:  quasar dev -m electron – To start development mode as Electron quasar build -m electron – To build the code as Electron  How it works... This is all possible because Quasar framework encapsulates the building, parsing, and bundling for you on the CLI. You don't need to worry about webpack and configurations with Electron, Cordova, or even Babel.   A simple CLI command can generate an entirely new page, layout, component, store, route, or even a new build for you. As the CLI is just a wrapper around Vue, webpack, Babel, and other tools, you are not tied to using only Quasar visual components. If you don't want to use them, it's possible to not import them and use the power of the CLI for building your application.

There are some ways to give these Vue APIs a new life, helping your development and productivity.  How to do it... We will divide this recipe into two categories: one for the watchers and another for the computed properties. Some methods are commonly used together, such as the non-cached computed and deep-watched values.   Watchers These three watcher recipes were selected to improve productivity and the final code quality. The usage of these methods can reduce code duplication and improve code reuse.  [ 498 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More Using method names All watchers can receive a method name instead of functions, preventing you from writing duplicated code. This will help you avoid re-writing the same code, or checking for values and passing them to the functions:  Chapter 11    export default {   watch: {     myField: 'myFunction',   },   data:    =>  {     myField: '',   } ,   methods: {     myFunction   {       console.log 'Watcher using method name.' ;     },  }, };    Immediate calls and deep listening You can set your watcher to execute as soon as it is created by passing a property immediately and make it execute no matter the value's depth of mutation by calling the deep property:    export default {   watch: {     myDeepField: {       handler newVal, oldVal  {         console.log 'Using Immediate Call, and Deep Watch' ;         console.log 'New Value', newVal ;         console.log 'Old Value', oldVal ;       },       deep: true,       immediate: true,     },   },   data:    =>  {     myDeepField: '',   } , };    [ 499 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More Multiple handlers You can make your watcher execute various handlers at the same time, without needing to set the watch handler to bind to a unique function:  Chapter 11    export default {   watch: {     myMultiField: [       'myFunction',       {         handler newVal, oldVal  {           console.log 'Using Immediate Call, and Deep Watch' ;           console.log 'New Value', newVal ;           console.log 'Old Value', oldVal ;         },         immediate: true,       },     ],   },   data:    =>  {     myMultiField: '',   } ,   methods: {     myFunction   {       console.log 'Watcher Using Method Name' ;     },   }, };    Computed Sometimes computed properties are just used as simple cache-based values, but there is more power to them. Here are two methods that show how to extract this power.  No cached value You can make your computed property an always updated value, rather than a cached value, by setting the cache property to false:    export default {   computed: {     field: {       get   {  [ 500 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11         return Date.now  ;       },       cache: false,    },   }, };    Getter and setter You can add a setter function to your computed property and make it a fully complete data attribute, but not bound to the data.  It's not recommended to do this, but it's possible, and in some cases, you may need to do it. An example is when you have to save a date in milliseconds, but you need to display it in an ISO format. Using this method, you can have the dateIso property get and set the value:    export default {   data:    =>  {     dateMs: '',   } ,   computed: {     dateIso: {       get   {         return new Date this.dateMs .toISOString  ;       },       set v  {         this.dateMs = new Date v .getTime  ;       },    },   }, };    See also You can find more information about the Vue watch API at https: ​ ​vuejs.​org ​v2 ​api  watch.​  You can find more information about the Vue computed API at https: ​ ​vuejs.​org ​v2  api ​computed.​  [ 501 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  Creating a Nuxt.js SSR with Python Flask as the API Nuxt.js is a server-side rendering framework that renders everything at the server and delivers it loaded. With this process, the page gets the power of SEO and fast API fetching before rendering.  Using it correctly, you can achieve a powerful SPA or PWA with other functions that weren't possible before.  In the backend, Python is an interpreted dynamic language that is fast and stable. With an active user base and quick learning curve, this is perfect for server APIs.  Joining both together, it is possible to get a powerful application deployed as fast as possible.  Getting ready‌ The pre-requisites for this recipe are as follows:  Node.js 12+ Python  create-nuxt-app  The Node.js global object that is required is as follows:  To install create-nuxt-app, you need to execute the following command in Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows :  > npm install -g create-nuxt-app  For the backend of this recipe, we will use Python. The Python global objects required for this recipe are as follows:  flask  flask-restful  flask-cors  [ 502 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  To install flask, flask-restful, and flask-cors, you need to execute the following  command in Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows :  > pip install flask > pip install flask-restful > pip install flask-cors  How to do it... We will need to split our recipe into two parts. The first part is the backend part  or API if you prefer , which will be done with Python and Flask. The second part will be the frontend part, and it will run on Nuxt.js in SSR mode.  Creating your Flask API Our API server will be based on the Python Flask framework. We will need to create a server folder to store our server files and start the development of the server.  You will need to install the following Python packages. To do so, open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following commands:  To install the Flask framework, use the following command:  > pip install flask  To install the Flask RESTful extension, use the following command:  > pip install flask-restful  To install the Flask CORS extension, use the following command:  > pip install flask-cors  Initializing the application To create our simple RESTful API, we will create a single file and use SQLite3 as a database:  1.  Create a folder named server and create a file named app.py in it:  import sqlite3 as sql from flask import Flask from flask_restful import Resource, Api, reqparse from flask_cors import CORS  [ 503 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  app = Flask __name__  api = Api app  CORS app   parser = reqparse.RequestParser    conn = sql.connect 'tasks.db'  conn.execute 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks  id INTEGER PRIMARY    KEY AUTOINCREMENT, task TEXT '  conn.close    2.  Then, we will create our ToDo class, and on the constructor of the class, we will connect to the database and select all tasks:  class ToDo Resource :     def get self :         con = sql.connect 'tasks.db'          cur = con.cursor           cur.execute 'SELECT * from tasks'          tasks = cur.fetchall           con.close            return {             'tasks': tasks         }  3.  To implement the RESTful POST method, create a function that receives task as an argument, and will add an object with the task that was added, the status of the addition to the tasks list, and then return the list to the user:   def post self :         parser.add_argument 'task', type=str          args = parser.parse_args           con = sql.connect 'tasks.db'          cur = con.cursor           cur.execute 'INSERT INTO tasks task  values  "                        {}" '.format args['task']           con.commit           con.close            return {             'status': True,             'task': '{} added.'.format args['task']          }  [ 504 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  4.  Next, we will create the RESTful PUT method by creating a function that will receive the task and id as arguments of the function. Then, this function will update task with the current id, and return to the user the updated task and the status of the update:  def put self, id :         parser.add_argument 'task', type=str          args = parser.parse_args            con = sql.connect 'tasks.db'          cur = con.cursor           cur.execute 'UPDATE tasks set task = "{}" WHERE id =            {}'.format args['task'], id           con.commit           con.close            return {             'id': id,             'status': True,             'task': 'The task {} was updated.'.format id          }  5.  Then, create a RESTful DELETE method by creating a function that will receive the ID of the task, which will be removed, and then will return to the user the ID, status, and the task that was removed:   def delete self, id :         con = sql.connect 'tasks.db'          cur = con.cursor           cur.execute 'DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = {}'.format id           con.commit           con.close            return {             'id': id,             'status': True,             'task': 'The task {} was deleted.'.format id          }  6.  Finally, we will add the ToDo class as a resource to the API on the ' ' route, and initialize the application:  api.add_resource ToDo, ' ', '  '   if __name__ == '__main__':     app.run debug=True   [ 505 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More Starting the server To start your server, you need to open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  Chapter 11  > python server app.py  Your server will be running and listening on http:  localhost:5000.   Creating your Nuxt.js server To render your application, you will need to create your Nuxt.js application. Using the Nuxt.js create-nuxt-app CLI, we will create it and choose some options for it. Open Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and execute the following command:  > create-nuxt-app client  Then, you will be asked some questions about the installation process. We will use the following:  1.  When you start creating your project with Nuxt-CLI, it will first ask for the project name. In our case, we will choose client as the name:  Project Name: client  2.  Then you need to choose the programming language that will be used in the project. We will select JavaScript:  > Programming language:  Use arrow keys     ❯ JavaScript      TypeScript  3.  Next, Nuxt-CLI will ask for the package manager that will be used to install the dependencies. In our case, we choose Yarn, but you can choose the one you prefer:  > Package manager:  Use arrow keys     ❯ Yarn      npm  4.  Now, Nuxt-CLI will ask for a UI framework to be used in the project. From the available list, choose Bulma:  > UI Framework: Bulma  [ 506 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  5.  Then, Nuxt-CLI will ask whether you want to select extra modules for the project. We will select Axios from the current list of modules:  > Nuxt.JS modules: Axios  6.  Nuxt-CLI will ask for the linting tools we want to use on our project; we will choose None:  > Choose Linting tools: None  7.  Then, Nuxt-CLI will ask for the test framework we want to implement on our project; we will choose None:  > Choose Test Framework: None  8.  Next, Nuxt-CLI will ask for the rendering mode that will be used by the project; we will select Universal  SSR :  > Choose Rendering Mode: Universal  SSR   9.  Nuxt-CLI will ask for the deployment target that will be used on the building structure; we will choose Server  Node.js hosting :  > Deployment target: Server  Node.js hosting   10.  Finally, Nuxt-CLI will ask for the development tool configuration that we want to use; we will select jsconfig.json:  > Development tools: jsconfig.json  After the CLI finishes the installation process, we can open the client folder on our editor or IDE.  Adding Bulma to the global CSS To add Bulma to the application, we need to declare it in the nuxt configuration file by  doing the following:  1. 2.  Open nuxt.config.js, in the client folder. Then, update the CSS property and add the Bulma import, to make it available in the global scope of the application:  export default {    * We need to change only the css property for now, *     * the rest we will maitain the same *   [ 507 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11     *    ** Global CSS    *    css: ['bulma css bulma.css'], }  Conﬁguring the axios plugin To start creating our API calls, we need to add the axios plugin in our application:  1.  To do so, we will need to open the nuxt.config.js, file in the root folder, and add the axios property:  export default {    * We need to change only the axios property for now, *     * the rest we will maitain the same *    axios: {}, }  2.  On the axios property, add the following configuration properties:  HOST and define it as '127.0.0.1' PORT and define it as '5000' https and define it as false  debug and define it as true:  axios: {   HOST: '127.0.0.1',   PORT: '5000',   https: false,   debug: true,    Only on development },  Running the Nuxt.js server Now that you have everything set, you want to run the server and start to see what is going on. Nuxt.js comes with some pre-programmed npm scripts out of the box. You can run one of the following commands by opening Terminal  macOS or Linux  or the Command Prompt PowerShell  Windows  and executing the following:  npm run dev – To run the server in development mode npm run build – To build the files with webpack and minify the CSS and JS for production  [ 508 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  npm run generate – To generate static HTML pages for each route npm start – To start the server in production, after running the build command  Creating the TodoList component For the TodoList app, we will need a component that will fetch the tasks and delete the tasks.  Single ﬁle component   section Here, we will create the   section of the single file component:  1.  2.  In the client components folder, create a file named TodoList.vue and open it. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with a name property defined as TodoList, then define the beforeMount life cycle hook as an asynchronous function. Define the computed and methods properties as an empty JavaScript object. Then, create a data property defined as a singleton function returning a JavaScript object. In the data property, create a taskList property as an empty array:  export default {   name: 'TodoList',   data:    =>  {     taskList: [],   } ,   computed: {},   async beforeMount   {},   methods: {}, };  3.  In the computed property, create a new property called taskObject. This computed property will return the result of Object.fromEntries new Map this.taskList  :  taskObject   {       return Object.fromEntries new Map this.taskList  ;     },  [ 509 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  4.  In the methods property, create a new method called getTask – it will be an asynchronous function. This method will fetch the tasks from the server, then will use the response to define the taskList property:  async getTasks   {       try {         const { tasks } = await            this.$axios.$get 'http:  localhost:5000' ;         this.taskList = tasks;       } catch  err  {         console.error err ;       }     },  5.  Then, create a deleteTask method. This method will be an asynchronous function and will receive an id as a parameter. Using this parameter, it will execute an API execution to delete the task and then execute the getTask method:  async deleteTask i  {       try {         const { status } = await            this.$axios.$delete `http:  localhost:5000 ${i}` ;         if  status  {           await this.getTasks  ;         }       } catch  err  {         console.error err ;       }     },  6.  Finally, in the beforeMount life cycle hook, we will execute the getTask method:  async beforeMount   {     await this.getTasks  ;   },  [ 510 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More Single ﬁle component   section It's time to create the   section of the single file component:  Chapter 11  1. 2.  3.  In the client components folder, open the TodoList.vue file. In the   section, create a div HTML element, and add the class attribute with the value box:      As a child of the div.box HTML element, create a div HTML element, with the class attribute defined as content, with a child element defined as an ol HTML element and the attribute type defined as 1:            4.  As a child of the ol HTML element, create a li HTML element, with the v-for directive defined as  task, i  in taskObject, and the key attribute defined as a variable, i:  <li   v-for=" task, i  in taskObject"   :key="i">    5.  Finally, as a child of the ol HTML element, add {{ task }} as the inner text, and as a sibling of the text, create a button HTML element, the class attribute defined as delete is-small, and the @click event listener defined as the deleteTask method, passing the i variable as an argument:  {{ task }} <button   class="delete is-small"   @click="deleteTask i "  >  Creating the Todo form component To send the task to the server, we will need a form. That means we need to make a form component that will handle this for us.  [ 511 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More Single ﬁle component   section Here, we will create the   section of the single file component:  Chapter 11  1.  2.  In the client components folder, create a file named TodoForm.vue and open it. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with a name property defined as TodoForm, then define the methods property as an empty JavaScript object. Then, create a data property defined as a singleton function returning a JavaScript object.

This recipe shows the integration between a local API server via Python and an SSR platform served via Nuxt.js.  When you start the Python server first, you are opening the ports to receive data from clients as a passive client, just waiting for something to happen to start your code. With the same process, the Nuxt.js SSR can do a lot of stuff behind the scenes, but when it finishes, it goes idle, waiting for user action.  When the user interacts with the frontend, the application can send some requests to the server that will be handed back to the user with data, to be shown on the screen.

You need to be aware and alert all the time. In this section, we'll look at how you can prevent attacks with some techniques and simple solutions.  Linters When using ESLint, make sure you have enabled the Vue plugin, and you are following the strongly recommended rules. Those rules will help you with the development, checking for some common mistakes that can open doors to attacks such as the v-html directive.  In a Vue-CLI project, with the options for linters selected, a file named .eslintrc.js will be created along with the project files. In this file, a set of basic rules will be pre- determined. The following is an example of a set of good practice rules for an ESLint + AirBnb project:  module.exports = {   root: true,   env: {     node: true,   },   extends: [     'plugin:vue essential',     'plugin:vue recommended',     'plugin:vue strongly-recommended',     '@vue airbnb',   ], parserOptions: {     parser: 'babel-eslint',   }, rules: {  'no-console': process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'error' : 'off',  'no-debugger': process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'error' : 'off',  }, };  [ 517 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Chapter 11  Now, if you have any code that breaks the lint rules, it won't be parsed on development or build.  JavaScript JavaScript has some vulnerabilities that can be prevented by following some simple checklists and simple implementations. Those implementations can be in client-server communications or DOM manipulation, but you always need to be careful not to forget them.  Here are some tips for using JavaScript:  Always use an authenticated and encrypted API when possible. Remember that JWT isn't encrypted by itself; you need to add the layer of encryption  JWE  to have the whole JSON. Always use SessionStorage if you want to store an API token. Always sanitize the HTML input from the user before sending it to the server. Always sanitize the HTML before rendering it to the DOM. Always escape any RegeExp from the user; it will be executed, to prevent any CPU thread attack. Always catch errors and don't show any stack trace to the user, to prevent any code manipulation.  Here are some tips on what not to do when using JavaScript:  Never use eval  ; it makes your code run slowly and opens a door for malicious code to execute inside your code. Never render any input from the user without any sanitization or escaping the data. Never render any HTML on the DOM without any sanitization. Never store an API token on LocalStorage. Never store sensitive data in the JWT object.  Vue When developing a Vue application, you need to check for some basic rules that can help the development and won't open any doors for the external manipulation of your application.  [ 518 ]   Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More  Here are some tips for using Vue:  Chapter 11  Always add type validation to your props, and if possible, a validator check. Avoid the global registration of components; use local components. Always use lazy-loaded components, when possible. Use $refs instead of direct DOM manipulation.  Here are some tips on what not to do when using Vue:  Never store Vue, $vm, $store, or any application variable on the window or any global scope. Never modify the Vue prototype; if you need to add a new variable to the prototype, make a new Vue plugin. It's not recommended to use a direct connection between components, as it will make the component bound to the parent or child.
