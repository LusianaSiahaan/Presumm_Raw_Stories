SEO  stands  Optimization”.   for   “Search  Engine  What are Search Engines?  Google, Bing and Yahoo are the three best  known  search  engines,  but  most   SEO  efforts  focus  on  Google  since  that is by far the most widely used.  In  a  nutshell  -  SEO  is  the  art  of ranking on page 1 in Google - ideally the 1 spot.  Why would that be important?  Because  the  higher  you  rank    the more organic traffic  =people googling  your  site  will  receive  and  with  that potential new readers and customers.  To understand how powerful SEO is,  lets look at a few numbers:   Statistics show that page 1 in Google gets  95%  of  all  search  traffic   =people googling !  Page  2  receives  5%.  Page  3  only  1%.  Let that sink in for a moment….  Even  more  staggering  -  61%  of  traffic go to the 1-3 spots.  The 1 spot actually gets a staggering 33-40% of all search traffic on Google!!  That is HUGE!  In comparison, only 10% go to paid   though  ads  are  very Ads  -  even  expensive,  whereas  organic  ranking  is mostly free  once you get there…. .  That’s  why  SEOs  are  some  of  the highest paid marketing consultants in the world  with  up  to  20K  per  month  per client!   Yes, you heard correctly!  The  monthly  revenue  from  having  a site rank 1 in a competitive niche will be a LOT higher than those 20K, which is  why  companies  are  more  than  happy to pay well.  I  have  several  friends  -  my  SEO   mentors  in  fact  -  who  make  100,000 Dollars per month from SEO!  It sounds incredible, but these are not singular cases, but remarkably frequent.  This income comes from both:  *  SEO  clients  =  companies  who want  to  rank  their  websites  in  the  top spots.  Note  that  SEO  Consulting  is always  a  monthly  service  because  it takes  consistent  effort  to  get  to  the  top spots and stay there   - and -  *  Affiliate  sites  -  your  own  sites   where you market affiliate products for a commission.  Obviously,  too, requires a high degree of SEO expertise, otherwise, you’ll have to pay for Google and Facebook ads - and still won’t have remotely the same results  that,   How does SEO work?  Google’s  1  concern  is  to  provide the most relevant high quality content to whatever  “Keyword”  someone  puts  into  the  search  bar  when “googling”.  phrase    =   SEO   you convincing  Google  that  your  content  is  therefore   about   is    the best and most relevant available for this search term.  That’s what it’s all about.  How do you convince Google?  Well,  first  of  all,  you  are  not convincing  a  person   an  employee  at Google.  That  would  be  absurd  and physically impossible given the billions of searches every day.  Instead, Google employs little cyber “bots” that constantly crawl the net and every page on there. The bots catalogue all your content and determine what it is   about and how valuable relevant it is.  So you need to send signals that the Google bots can understand - and do so consistently.   You need to build up “authority” with Google.  Prove  that  you  are  a  reputable site  with  quality  content  that  will  be truly helpful to their readers.   Obviously, that takes time, especially when your site is brand new, but you can greatly  speed  up  the  process  by employing a number of SEO techniques.  That’s what this book will teach you.   Keywords vs. Niches  To  clarify  -  you  don’t  just  “rank”, you  always  rank  for  a  specific  search term  or  “keyword”  as  they  are  called. For example, someone might google:  How do I potty train my Dog?  If you want to rank on page 1 for that keyword,  you  will  need  to  SEO “optimize” your article for that phrase.   In  other  words,  your  site  will  rank for many different search terms - each on a  different  rank  within  the  “SERPs”  = the  result  pages  that  come  up  after  you   google something.  SERPs = “Search Engine Result  Pages”  And it’s not just individual posts. If “dog  training”  is  your  main  niche,  then your entire site needs to be optimized for that keyword.  Optimization  happens  both  “On Page”=  on  your  site  and  “Off  Page”  = anything that points or links to your site.  The  more  competitive  a  keyword, e.g.  the  more  people  are  trying  to  rank for  it,  the  more  difficult  it  will  be  to reach  the  top  spots.  In  some  cases,  it   will be impossible for you with a brand new site.  This is where “Authority “comes in.   Sites like Wikipedia, CNN, National Geographic  etc.  enjoy  huge  authority with  Google,  because  they  are  long established and highly regarded.  You  cannot  “beat”  those  sites  in  the beginning  and  there  are  also  certain keywords search phrases that you simply will  not  be  able  to  rank  for  in  the  first year or two, such as:  “Make money online” “Weight Loss”   “Lawyer New York”  are   Those   competitive keywords with millions of sites trying to rank for them.   highly   even   Notice,  I  say  “keywords”  -  not “niches”.  Because  in  very competitive  niches,  you  can  still  rank and  monetize  your  site  -  but  for  a different type  of  keyword….    more  on that in Chapter 2.  White Hat vs. Black Hat SEO  There  are  a  number  of  SEO techniques that can greatly speed up the   process,  and  they  are  grouped  into “White  Hat”  “Black  Hat” techniques.  and   As you probably guessed White Hat follows Google’s rules and policies, but is by far not as fast and effective, while Black Hat techniques can help you rank very quickly, but come with a significant risk  of  getting  penalized  or  de-indexed  = your site being banned from Google - and you don’t ever want that to happen!   In  this  book,  we  will  only  cover White Hat techniques as those will give you  plenty  to  start  with  -  and  without running into trouble with Google.   How does Google determine where  to rank you?  Google doesn’t exactly tell us - that’s the  whole  point  -  and  their  ranking algorithm  keeps  changing  to  adjust  to ever new Black Hat tactics.  You may have heard of “Panda” and “Penguin”  updates  and  wondered  what that was all about?  We’ll  cover  those   in  the  chapter, but for now let me just say:   last  SEO is a constant game of hide and its  seek  between  Google  changing    algorithm and SEOs then trying to figure out  how  that  new algorithm.   to  rank  within   they   Once   find  effective  ways, Google  responds  with  another  update and a stricter set of rules to keep it fair and  punish  unethical  techniques.  And then we start again….  It’s   important   to  understand   that unless  a  page  has  huge  authority  like CNN,  Forbes,  Wikipedia,  or  Amazon, any  site  ranking  on  page  1  for  very competitive terms is applying at least a few Black Hat techniques.   It’s   impossible   to   get   there   otherwise,  unless  you  give  it  years  and years to grow authority naturally.  That’s  ok  as  long  as  that  site  is providing  value  and  helpful  content. Gone  are  the  days  where  SEOs  could just spam the heck out of a site and rank 1.  These  days,  they  would  quickly  be slapped  with  a  penalty  and  de-indexed  =disappear from Google .   As I mentioned before, Google’s 1 priority  is  to  provide  the  best,  most relevant content to their customers that’s available right now.  SEO  therefore  is  about  sending  the “right” signals to the Google bots to get   ranked as high as possible. The bots are not  people,  they  don’t  think  or  feel, instead they are programmed to respond to certain signals and then rank that site accordingly.  What  signals  are  the  Google  bots  Most   of   all,   authority   and  looking for?  relevance.   You  need  to  show  that  you  are  an expert and that your content is the most relevant - while you are competing with every other related site on the internet!   Scary?  Not really….;-  - if you understand a few  basic  principles  and  techniques  - and have some patience!   Building authority with Google takes time,  especially  with  a  brand  new  site. You have to prove that you are worthy of the exposure and the newer the site, the more  skeptical  Google  will  be  - understandably.  So start as soon as your site is set up and  apply  the  principles  taught  here consistently.  Over  time,  you  will  see results,  and  once  Google  starts  taking you seriously, it becomes more of a self   runner.  Maintaining your status will be much easier  than  getting  there,  so  your  initial effort is well worth it in the long run.  Keep  in  mind  also  that  the  majority of  bloggers  never  bother  to  learn  these principles. And unless you are in a very competitive  of knowledgable people, it won’t take that much effort to get to page 1. But it takes consistent  excellent effort  keyword research.  niche  with   lots   and   -   During the initial months, while you are  building  trust  with  google,  you  can use  other  techniques  like  Social  Media   Marketing, Kindle books, guest posting and the techniques taught in book 2 of this series to drive “traffic”  =potential readers  to your side.  Eventually  you  will  be  able  to  rely more  and  more  on  SEO  and  no  longer have to hustle, network and pay for ads. You can still continue with those, but on a  much  smaller  scale,  because  in  the long run, SEO is the most effective - and consistent  -  traffic  generator  on  the internet!  What  parameters  does  Google  look at?   Google looks at 3 areas:  * On Page  * Off Page  * Social Media  On Page  is  everything  that  happens on your website. How you structure your site. How you interlink your pages, how you write your posts etc.  Is there a clear site structure that the  bot can easily read?   Do you add fresh, quality content on  a regular basis?   Is  that  content  optimized  for  the  keywords you are trying to rank for?  Is there a lot of interaction with your readers in the form of comments, social media shares etc.?  Off  Page  is  everything  pointing  at your  site  =  Backlinks  from  other  sites, incl. social media. You might have heard the term “Link Juice”. That’s what this is referring to:  How  many  sites  are  linking  to  you? and  most  importantly,  are  they  of  high quality authority  or  are  they  spammy   sites?  As an example, the New York Times linking  to  one  of  your  articles  will greatly  boost  your  authority,  whereas low quality backlinks from spammy sites can seriously harm you.  friend   If  your  friend  links  to  you  from  a brand new website, it will also not have much  weight,  no  matter  how  nice  or proficient  your  is.  His her “Domain  Authority”  will  be  zero  and that’s  exactly  how  much  link  juice  you get  -  zero.  Still  good  to  interlink, because  those  sites  will  grow  and  you can  both  boost  each  other’s  authority over time.   We  will  cover  Off  Page  more  in  Chapter 3.  Social  Signals  are  a  more  recent addition  to  Google’s  ranking  algorithm, but  have  since  greatly  gained  in importance.  A  site  without  any  social signals  -  likes,  shares,  retweets  etc  - will not rank, and that makes sense.   In  this  day  and  age,  any  relevant, helpful  or  inspiring  article  will  be shared  on  social  media,  so  if  there  are no social signals, but a lot of backlinks, something  is  clearly  not  right  and Google will respond accordingly.   A  scenario  like  the  above  would look  fishy  and  is  often  a  sign  of  Black Hat  techniques,  because,  yes,  you  can manufacture  backlinks  to  boost  your authority,  and  Google  is  always  on  the lookout for any suspicious behavior.  You will need to address all 3 areas, and all of them together determine how Google will rank you.  One more thing….  It’s  important  to  understand,  that Google  ranks  your  urls,  in  other  words your  address -  not  your  YourAwesomeSite.com    name web   domain    content. Whatever you accomplish stays with that domain name. If you change it, you have to start all over again, even if you transfer all your articles to the new domain!  Yet  another  important  reason  not  to waste  time  on  commercial  blogging platforms  like  Blogger,  Weebly  or WordpressCOM   not  be  confused  with the  non-profit,  free  WordpressORG software that most bloggers use :   When  you  leave  these  very  limiting platforms  -  and  you  will  eventually  if you  are  serious  about  blogging  and making money online - you might loose your domain name and then all the work   and  effort  you  put  in  over  weeks  and months will be lost and you have to start all over again.

Before we get into optimizing your site and blog posts, we need to make sure the following two elements are in place and properly set up:  * Mobile Compatibility  = how well does your site design adjust and function to mobile devices?   *  Site  Speed   =  how  quickly  does  your site load?   Mobile-Friendly   In  one  of  the  more  recent  algorithm updates  April 2015 , Google made it a requirement for every site to be “mobile friendly”.   A lot of web sites lost their ranking, because  they  didn’t  pay  attention  or didn’t update in time, so be sure to take care of this right from the start.  A staggering 70% of users access the internet  through  mobile  devices  these days,  so  it  is  really  important  that  your site looks good and is fully functional on all.  Fortunately,  most  themes  are  now “mobile  friendly”,  so  you  shouldn’t  run   into any problems, but always make sure “responsive”  listed  as  a  feature whenever  you  review  a  Wordpress theme.  is   To   test  your  site  you  can  use  Googles’s Mobile-Friendly Test:   Site Speed  forever   You have probably visited sites that take  really frustrating  and  I  usually  just  press  the back button and find a faster alternative.   load.   It’s   to   Google is aware of this behavior and punishes  slow  sites.  You  will  not  ever rank high with a slow loading site.  An easy way to test your site’s speed  is Google Page Speed Insights.  You  can  enter  your  site  name  and will  get  two  speed  metrics  -  one  for   mobile devices and one for desktop.     Ideally, both values should be green. Occasionally  yellow  is  still  ok,  but  the numbers  should  not  be  lower  than  70, ideally above 80.  If  your  site  does  not  meet  those requirements,  Google  will  provide  you with a number of instructions on how to improve site speed. It’s a rather complex and  time  consuming  task,  so  I  usually outsource  to  someone  on  Fiverr  or Konker.   This is one of the gigs I have used in the  past,  pretty  inexpensive,  and  I  can focus  my  time  on  other  things:  Fiverr Site Speed Gig   Plugins that improve Site Speed  There are number of free Wordpress plugins  that  will  greatly  help  with  site speed. I would recommend installing at least the first 3:  1    Database   Optimizer:  WPOptimize  By  default,  WordPress  stores  every post,  page,  and  comment  including  post revisions,  trash  data,  and  information from various plugins.   WP  Optimize  helps  you  de-clutter your  database  by  removing  stale  post   trashed revisions,  items, and removal of transient options.   spam  comments,   Less clutter = more speed!  2  Caching Plugin: W3 Total Cache  or WP Super Cache  A  caching  plugin  stores  your  site’s images, files and data on the server, so it doesn’t  have  to  load  the  website  from scratch  every  time  someone  visits. Instead, the static version of your site is displayed. This saves a lot of resources and works with any type of website.  3  Photo Optimizer: WPSmush.it   High quality photos can greatly slow down  a  site’s  loading  speed.  As  a general rule, always save your photos at no more than 100KB total size and at the actual  dimensions  that  the  photos  will show  in  the  post.  Photoshop,  Apple Preview  and  various  other  photo softwares  allow  you  those to  set  parameters without loosing quality.  A  plugin  like  WP  Smush.it  will further  ensure  that  images  are  properly compressed  appropriate formats.   and   use   This plugin reduces image file sizes, improves  the metadata  from  JPEGs,  and  removes  performance,   strips    unused colors from indexed images.  4  Lazyloader: BJ Lazy Load Allows  you  to  “lazy  load”  post images and thumbnails by replacing them with a placeholder. The images are only loaded  as  they  are  about  to  become visible in a user’s browser.   5  P3 Profiler If  you  notice  problems  with  site speed, this plugin can help identify if any of your installed plugins are responsible.  To install any of the above plugins,   open  your  WP  Admin  Board,  go  to Plugins -> Add New -> enter the plugin name in the search bar, click “install” - > “activate”.    On Page Optimization  On Page Optimization should start from the  time  you  first  set  up  your  blog  or website.  Really…..don’t wait with this!  It  will  take  a  lot  longer  to  correct everything  later,  especially  once  your site is growing and there are many pages and sub pages. Get it right from the start   and then keep applying with every new page and post you add.  No SEO technique will work without proper On Page Optimization - so this is where you need to start.  What is On Page Optimization?  The art of making your site and posts easily  readable  for  the  Google  bots. Sending the “right” signals, so your site appears  relevant  and  offering  great information.  These  are  the  3  areas  you  need  to  cover:   * Keyword Research  * Optimize your overall site structure  * Optimize each page and post  Lets  start  with  keywords.  This  is  where the money is!   Unless  you  learn  keyword  research well,  ranking  will  be  very  difficult,  no matter  what  techniques  you  use,  so  lets dig right in….   Keyword Research  What are “Keywords”?  Keywords are the words and phrases we put in Google’s search bar when we try  to  find  something  -  e.g.  when  we “google”.  In other words, a keyword is usually not  just  one  word,  but  a  phrase  like   “how  to  bake  Christmas  cookies”  or “latest movie releases”.   Phrases  like  that  are  called  “Long Tail Keywords”, consisting of anywhere between  3-10  words,  and  those  LT keywords are the ones you want to rank for initially.  Why  not  rank  for  Short  Tail  Keywords?  Good question! - Why would you not want  to  rank  for  1-2  word  phrases  like “loosing  weight”,  “budget  travel”  or “parenting advice”?   Because  short  tail  keywords  are extremely competitive - at least most of them.   Page  1  in  Google  is  usually  filled with high authority sites like Wikipedia, Forbes,  CNN,  Amazon  or  whichever sites  are  the  top  authorities  in  that particular field.  It  would  be  impossible  for  you  to compete  with  them  or  rank  anywhere near page 1 for highly competitive, more general terms.  Instead  we  want  to  focus  on  Long Tail  Keywords  with  a  decent  search volume  at least 100 per month  and not   too  much  competition,  meaning  not  too many other sites are trying to rank for the same term.  From  now  on  -  each  of  your  posts will  focus  on  one  main  Long  Tail Keyword  and  you  can  sprinkle  a  few related  keywords  throughout.  Those  are also  called  “LSI”  keywords  =  latent semantic indexing  no need to remember that phrase…;- .  For  the  reader,  this  will  not  be noticeable,  in  case  you  are  concerned. Keyword density should be around 1%, so just enough to signal the Google bots what  they  should  rank  you  for  without being annoying to the reader.    How  do  we  find  rankable  LT  Keywords?  Keyword  Research   consists  of analyzing  and competition.  Don’t  worry,  it’s  not  as  complicated as it sounds…;-   volume   search   * Analyze Search Volume  Lets start with Google! - We enter a keyword idea  blog post topic  into the search bar - in this example “Building a Tree House”.   When  I  enter  this  phrase  you  notice   immediately  shows  me that  Google  related  keywords  that  are  frequently searched for:  This is helpful to get more ideas. You can  find  even  more  options  when  you scroll to the bottom:   Play  around  with  those  phrases  and see  what  other  LT  Keywords  Google shows you and then write down the ones that could apply to your post idea.  You  can  also  add  “Best”,  “Top”, “Easiest”,  “Cheapest”  or  whatever specification applies to your topic. This   will  narrow  it  down  even  further  and offer more options.  Next, we visit the Google Keyword Planner   GKP   to  find  out  how  many monthly searches a keyword receives = how  many  times  per  month  someone types  in  that  specific  keyword  into Google’s search bar.  If  you  completed  Book  2  in  this series, you will already have used GKP, if not, here is how you set it up:  First,  you  need  to  create  a  Google Adwords  account.  Don’t  worry,  you don’t  have  to  run  ads  or  spend  money. It’s  only  to  get  access  to  the  keyword   planner tool.  Go   Adwords.Google.com ko KeywordPlanner  and follow the prompts.  to  Once your account is set up you can  start your research.    Enter a niche or search term - I used  “Treehouse” in this example.   You have a few options to customize your search, including specific locations if  you  offer  a  local  service  or  product, filters, negative keywords etc.  Then  scroll  down  and  click  “Get ideas”  to  open  this  window  with  the monthly search results:   Please  note  that  Google  no  longer   gives out exact amounts unless you start an ad campaign, however, just the range is sufficient here.  For your main long tail keyword you want  ideally  at  least  500  searches  per month,  more  is  better  -  at  a  very minimum 100.  The keyword “treehouse” has 74,000 searches which is a lot, but I also used a short  tail  term  here  -  more  the  general niche than a specific phrase to see what Long Tail phrases the Keyword planner would suggest to me.  For  this,  we  scroll  down  and  can now view related terms and their search   volume.  A  great  way  to  get  Long  Tail keyword  ideas  and  see  right  away whether they have enough search volume to be viable candidates.    Notice how “treehouse” “tree house”   “tree houses” and “treehouses” all have entirely different search volumes - huge differences  actually.  So  little details  are  very,  very  important.  These are 4 entirely different keywords as far as the Google bots are concerned.  those   to   pay   Don’t   attention   the “competition” value. That’s related to ad campaigns and affiliate products and has nothing  to  do  with  “your”  SEO competition.  Another free tool to give you a wide is  range  of  related  keyword  UberSuggest.org.  ideas    Simply  enter  a  keyword  idea  or genre and you will receive an extensive list of possible combinations.   * Analyzing the Competition  To  find  out  how  competitive  a keyword  is,  we  start  by  entering  the phrase  into  the  Google  search  bar  and see  what  pages  show  on  page  1,  in particular the first 5 spots.   the  keyword   If you see a lot of well known = high authority  sites  like  wikipedia,  major media  outlets,  publishers,  blogs  etc., then  too competitive. You will not get to page 1 anytime  soon,  let  alone  the  top  3,  and unless  you  rank  traffic  from Google will be minimal.  is  probably   there,    If, however, you see mostly unknown sites, it’s worth researching further. For this,  you  need  to  install  the  MOZ Toolbar,  a  browser  extension.  It’s  free and  will  show  you  immediately  how authoritative the other sites are.  Authority & Trust  Before  we  install  MOZ,  let  me clarify the two most relevant metrics that are used to define site authority and trust in the eyes of Google.  1  Domain Authority  DA   &  Page Authority  PA  - assigned by MOZ.com  2  Trust Flow  TF  & Citation Flow    CF  - assigned by Majestic.com  It’s   important   to  understand   that neither  metric  is  officially  assigned  by Google! Both are simply approximations used to assist in SEO research and based on  Google  ranking  behavior  as  it  is currently being observed.  Google used to assign “Page Rank”, but has since abandoned that metric and not  updated  in  years. Therefore, Page Rank is now considered irrelevant  in case you ever come across that term .  the  numbers   None  of   the  above  metrics  are infallible, but in most cases give a pretty   accurate  description  of  how  much authority  and  trust  a  site  enjoys  with Google.  A  good  basis,  but  not  perfect, plus it usually takes a few weeks before changes are reflected in the score.  MOZ Tool Bar  gives  you  access  to DA  and  PA  as  well  as  the  number  of backlinks  to  a  side   see  the  black  bar underneath each listing . We will discuss backlinks  and  how  to  read  them  in  the 3rd chapter, for now lets look at DA and PA.   Domain Authority refers to the entire site, whereas Page Authority refers to a particular page article on that site. Most important  for  our  research  will  be  DA,   the overall authority of a site.  In  case  you  are  wondering  -  a domain is the name of your website, the URL as it’s also called:  YourAwesomeWebsite.com   You can also check DA and PA at:   OpenSiteExplorer      If  most  sites  on  page  1  have  a  DA below  20,  you  have  a  good  chance  of ranking there. If the site has less then 10 backlinks, even more so.   Often  however,  keywords  with  low competition  also  have  very  low  search volume. So while you could rank easily, it  wouldn’t  help  much,  because  not  too many people are looking for that phrase.  The  key  here  -  and  this  can  take  a little  bit  of  time  -  is  to  find  keywords with  little  to  no  competition  that  still have  at  the  very  least  100  monthly searchers, ideally more.  The other main metric is Trust Flow which you can check on Majestic.com. You get 2 free searches per day, and the result will look something like this:   Once  again,  if  sites  have  a  TF  of mostly <20, you have a good chance of ranking. If most are over 30, move on.   This is not an exact science, nor are these  exact  numbers  to  go  by  -  by  no means!  -  Ranking  depends  on  many different factors and you will get a better feeling for what works over time.   The above ranges are good estimates to go by when you first start - to have at least a basic idea of what is realistic and what is not.  Here  are  more  factors  to  look  at when  determining  competitiveness  of  a keyword:  Are  competitor  listings  keyword  optimized?   In addition to DA, TF and number of backlinks,  also  check  the  following  in your competitors’ SERP listings:  -  do  they  use  the  exact  keyword phrase  in  the  headline?  And  if  so,  how far in the front?  - do they use the keyword in the url?  -  do   they  use   the  meta description  the short text underneath the title   in   it   If  not  -  it  will  be  much  easier  to outrank them, even if they have a higher authority  score  than  you.  That’s  why Long  Tail  keywords  are  so  powerful,   if  you  are   the  only  one because  optimizing for that specific phrase, there is  a  good  chance  that  Google  will  rank you  higher,  even  if  you  are  new  and don’t have much authority yet!  Read that last sentence a few times to let it sink in, because that - at the core - is the art of effective keyword research.  Again, no one metric will ever give you  a  definite  prediction  -  and  even when  everything  seems  right,  Google doesn’t  always  respond  or  takes  time, sometimes months.   But  the  more  of  these  factors  are  in place, the more likely it is that you can   rank on page 1 - or ideally 1 - for that particular keyword phrase.  In  the  beginning,  and  especially  if you don’t have a lot of time, it is helpful to use keyword research tools to do the heavy lifting for you.  and   effective   The  most   still reasonably priced is Long Tail Pro. You can simply enter your keyword idea and the  program  will  provide  you  with  a long  list  of  possible  Long  Tail  Options together  for with  competitiveness.  score   a    If  this  is  still  too  expensive,  I  can recommend  this  Konker  gig,  for  just   $10  per  search  term.  It  will  be  money well  spent  -  and  saves  a  LOT  of  time doing the research yourself.  Do  you  need  to  do  keyword  research for every single article?   Not  necessarily,  but  definitely  for  every article you want to rank for.  So if you have a regular schedule of, lets  say,  1  post  per  week,  then  at  a minimum have at least 1 post per month with  a  more  in-depth  article  and thorough  keyword  research  -  and  also build some backlinks to that post  more on that in Chapter 3 .   That  way  it  doesn’t  become  too overwhelming  or  expensive  the beginning, but you are still beginning to build  authority  and  over  time  will  see results in the form of higher rankings.   in   Steady  does  it  with  SEO  and  that  would be a good basic schedule.  Now  lets  see  how  we  can  employ keywords  on  your  site  and  specific posts…   Optimizing your Site  Optimization  of  your  site  covers  a number of different areas:  Your Site’s Meta Data  Meta  data   site’s name title, tag line sub title and snippet  the  short  description  that  shows  in  include  your    google .  It  is  helpful  for  SEO  purposes  to include keywords relating to your niche in  the  meta  data  -  and  your  url   =  site name .    Having  a  keyword  in  your  domain name,  can  also  help  with  ranking  - either:  the  full  domain  =  EMD  =  exact Example:  domain   -   match  DogTraining.com  or partial domain = PMD = partial Example:  domain   match  -  OnlineDogTraining.com   is   toughening   These  days,  PMDs  are  safer  since Google  “Over- Optimization”  rules.  That’s  when  you stuff your keyword everywhere. Google considers  that  spamming  and  will downgrade or even penalize your site.  EMDs  are  easier  to  rank,  BUT  you have  to  know  exactly  how  often  and where you can use the main keyword and that takes time to learn. PMDs also rank well,  and  you  still  have  to  watch keyword  placement,  but  less contentious, so I would go with that  or no match  in the beginning.  it’s   For  local  businesses,  also  include example:  location,   for   your    -  or  similar. PlumberDallasTX.com  Makes it much easier to rank in a local market.  You  can  enter  all  your  meta  data  here:  Settings  ->  General  Settings  ->  enter your site name and tag line    Also be sure to indicate here whether  you want to use:  http:   - or - http:  www.   for   “WP  Address”   and   “Site  Address”.   To Google those are two completely separate  domains  with  two  different scores for Trust Flow.  Pick  one  version,  enter  it  here  and use  it  consistently  whenever  you  share your url or build links.  When  you  check  Trust  Flow  in Majestic,  always  check  both  “root   in   the   domain”   bare  url   &  “sub  domain”  with  www.   search  bar. Whichever  has  the  higher  score,  is  the main Site Address - the one that all SEO efforts are directed to - and the only one you should consider in your research.  Permalink Structure  Next,  lets  set  up  an  SEO  friendly Permalink  structure.  That’s  how  your post url appears, see below.  Within your WP Admin Board, go to “Settings” -> Permalinks and check the option with the red arrow:   Even without SEO, that url structure is much more pleasant on the eye - and much easier to read for the google bots. This  is  where  you  will  always  place your main keyword.   Interlinking  It  is  VERY  important  to  interlink your  pages  and  especially  related  blog posts. This again, helps the Google bots understand  how  your  site  is  structured and  how  everything  is  connected.  We will  go  into  more  detail  when  we optimize  your  first  post,  but  for  now make  sure  your  home  page  links  to  all other  top  level  pages   About,  Blog, Contact, Services etc. .  Linking  does  not  mean  -  linking through the “Menu”. You need to create a link  on  the  home  page  to  each  of  the   other sites. The link text can be anything. It doesn’t have to say “here is my About page” or similar. Just link from the home page  to  each  main  sub  page  and  then from those to any further sub pages.  Whenever you write a post, be sure to link to at least 2-3  related  posts and vice  versa.  Once  again,  it  helps  the Google bots understand what articles are related and or form a sub group on your site.  In the beginning when you only have a  few  pages,  this  may  not  seem  very important, but once your site grows to a few  hundred  -  it  will  become  very important, especially over years…   Yoast SEO Plugin  Before we go into the details of On Page optimization,  lets  first  install  a  very important tool - Yoast SEO plugin.   It’s  free,  the  1  rated  SEO  plugin around,  and  you  can  download  and activate  it  from  within  your  Wordpress admin board.   Go  to  “Plugins”   left  side  bar  in WP admin board  -> Add New -> enter Yoast SEO in the search bar -> Install -> Activate  You  will  see  the  “SEO”  tab  in  the left  side  bar.  This  is  where  you  will customize the plugin.  For  the  most  part,  you  can  use  the defaults, but two things need to be set up manually:  1   Connect  with  Google  Search  Console  2  Generate Sitemaps   Google Search Console  It’s  important  to  connect  your  new  site with  the  Google  Search  Console  GSC .   Any  communication  with  Google about your site will happen through your GSC account. You can also access many other  helpful  features  and  stats.  To  see them  all,  just  watch  a  Google  Search   Console Tutorial in Youtube.  This article by Yoast will show you how  to  set  up  your  GSC  account  and connect with the Yoast SEO plugin.  It’s  very  easy.  Will  only  take  5 minutes, so best do it now and have that out of the way.   Installing a Sitemap  Next,  you  want  to  upload  a  Sitemap  to make  it  easier  for  the  Google  bots  to crawl and rank your site.  Yoast  SEO  can  create  sitemaps  for you - after  you  connected  the  plugin  to your  GSC   see  prior  chapter .  This  is how you do it:  1.    2.  1.  On  your  Search  Console  home  page, select your website.  3.  2.   In   the   left  sidebar,  click  Crawl and then Sitemaps.  4.  3.   Remove   or invalid sitemaps like sitemap.xml 5.  4.  Click  the  Add Test  Sitemap  outdated   button in the top right.  6.  5.  Enter  sitemap_index.xml  into  the text box that appears.  7.  6. Click Submit. 8.  9.  Done!   Google Analytics  NOTE: if you read the first book in the blogging series and already set up your Google Analytics account, you can skip this chapter and go to Optimizing Your Posts.  *************  The most important tool for analyzing   and  tracking  your  blog  traffic  will  be Google  Analytics.  It  is  the  industry standard  for  website  analytics  and  an absolute must.  Google Analytics helps you to assess how  well  pages,  posts  and  features  are doing, who your audience is and where your traffic is coming from.  If  you  ever  want  to  work  with advertisers,  PR  agencies  or  sponsors, they  will  want  statistics  pulled  from Google  Analytics,  so  it  is  important  to get it set up from the start.  Even  if  you  are  not  planning  to monetize  your  site,  it  will  still  be  an   important tool to help you measure what works  and  what  doesn’t,  and  how  to grow your audience.  Once  again,  Youtube  has  plenty  of Tutorials  showing  you  all  the  different features  Google  Analytics  has  to  offer. For now, lets focus on setting it up and connecting it with your site.  Setting Up Google Analytics  Go  to  analytics.google.com  and sign up by following the prompts.  If you don’t  have  a  Google  account  yet   e.g., through  a  gmail  address   you  will  be asked to create one, but you can use your   regular  email  address   doesn’t  have  to be gmail .   Next,  you  will  be  guided  to  this  screen for Google Analytics sign up:    Click Sign up and on the next screen  follow the prompts:    Account: This will be the “umbrella name”  for  your  GA  account.  You  can have  several  different  websites  under one account, but this is the overall name. You  can  use  your  blog’s  name  or  any other name.  Property:  Enter  your  website  name  Scroll down and click, Get tracking  and url.  ID.  Next,  you  will  see  some  code  -  no need to panic…;-  - just hang in there…     First, go to   Admin  -> Property Settings -> turn on  each  of  the  tabs  under  Advertising Features. This will give you additional data from each visitor. These need to be turned  on  from  the  start  to  deliver accurate data.   Now  back  to  the  code.  Thankfully, there is a great plugin that will place the code for you, making things very easy:   Google Analyticator  If  you  haven’t  already  installed  and activated this plugin, do it now, and then   click on the Google Analytics tab in the left WordPress Admin bar.     This will lead you to Basic Settings. that  Google  Analytics Make  sure  logging  is  enabled,  and  select  the correct  Analytics  Account.  Then  press Save.    Next, you will see a message in your dashboard:  “Don't  miss  your  crawl errors:  connect  with  Google  Search Console here.”    Click on the link, then click on Get  Google Authorization Code.  In the pop-up, click Allow, and then copy  and  paste  the  prompted  code  into the  box.  Then  click  Authenticate  and Save Profile.    All done!  Seeing Your First Statistics  Google updates data several times a day. Go to Reporting and try the various options  in  the  left  hand  sidebar.  To  see who is on your site right now, click Real time -> Overview.    Of  course,  you  won’t  see  anything   right after set-up, so give it a day, or at least a few hours, and then check again.  As  your  site  grows,  this  will  be really  fun  and  also  give  you  valuable insight for improving your site.   Optimizing your Posts  Now  you  are  ready  to  optimize  your posts and pages.  You  can  also  follow  along  via  this  video:  SassyZenGirl.com Onpage-SEO  Where to place your Keyword?   Headline Your keyword has to be part of your headline,  ideally  in  the  beginning  or  as far in the front as possible. Also watch this when you analyze your competition. Do they have the exact keyword phrase in the headline and if so where? If they don’t, it will be much easier to outrank them.  URL Make the url the main keyword. This is very important and will go a long way in helping you to rank. Also, watch this when analyzing the competition.   First Paragraph Mention  the  main  keyword  once  in the first paragraph to establish what the post is about  for the Google bots    1% Keyword Density Keyword  Density  means:  how  often you  use  the  keyword  per  word  word count. A good base to start with is once per  100  words.  Doesn’t  have  to  be exact,  but  as  a  general  guideline.  More can  be  considered  “keyword  stuffing”  spam  in  Google’s  eyes… ,  less  is  too vague  a  signal  for  the  Google  bots  . Yoast  SEO  will  tell  you  the  keyword density of your posts, so it’s very easy to check  see below .  H2    =largest  Sub  Heads   ->  “Heading 2”   Mention the main keyword once in an H2. Again - once only - not in every H2!   This  is  where  you  set  up  H2s   biggest sub head option :  Highlight  the  text  you  want  to  turn into  a  “Heading”  and  then  click  the   above.  Picture Alt text Always  have  at  least  1  picture  per article.  More  is  better.  Google  loves visual media!  Mention  the  keyword  once  in  the  picture “Alt text”  see picture below .   The Alt text explains to blind readers what the picture is about - and - also to the  Google  bots  who  cannot  read pictures,  but  need  to  be  told  what’s  in them.  A  great  way  to  place  your keywords…   You can also change the picture url to your  keyword  before  you  upload  into   WP. Example in this case:   Victoria-Falls-Hotel.jpeg  With  several  pictures,  mix  it  up. Don’t use the keyword for every one to avoid over-optimizing keyword stuffing.  Rather  use  related  or  secondary  keywords - or synonyms.  Video Embed  a  video  with   the  main keyword  in  the  title.  If  you  have  your own, great - otherwise, search a relevant video  on  Youtube  an  embed  within  the article.   To embed a video into a post, simply copy  and  paste  the  Youtube  url  into  the post  the  “visual”  WP editor ,  and  the  video  will  come  up automatically.  text   within   Links Have  a  least  1  outgoing  link  to  an authority  site,  e.g.  a  wikipedia  page covering  your  keyword  topic,  or  any other well respected authoritative site.   This  creates  trustworthiness  for  the  Google bots.   You don’t need to mention Wikipedia   or  explain  the  link.  Just  place  it  on  the keyword  within  your  text,  ideally  more in  the  beginning.  Remember,  this  is  for SEO purposes, to create trustworthiness with  the  Google  bots  -  not  for  your readers.   This  is  how  you  set  up  outgoing  links:   Interlink Always  interlink  with  several  other   posts or pages on your blog. Something related, not just random.  Use  “Link  to  existing  content”  to  connect internally.  A  little  trick  for  both  outgoing  and  interlinking:  Click “Open link in a new Tab”. That way the initial page stays open while the reader  is  looking  at  the  new  page  => counts  towards  the  time  visitors  spend on your site => decreases bounce rate….  see Chapter 3     Meta Description The  meta  description  is  the  text people see when your page shows up in the  SERPs.  Another  important  area  to mention  your  keyword  once  -  but  NO more  than  that.  You  can  also  use  an alternate  keyword  with  same meaning  LSI .  the   To edit your meta data, scroll down from  your  post  editor  all  the  way  to Yoast SEO. You will see this box:   Click  “Edit  snippet”  and  adjust  the   text. The editor will show you how long your text can be, e.g. how much will be visible in the SERPs.  You can also edit your social media snippets  here,  if  you  want  them  to  be different:    Yoast SEO Plugin  Scroll  down  a  little  further  and  you  will see this box:    First  you  need  to  enter  your  target   keyword, right under the snippet editor, and then Yoast will show you how well optimized your post is.  Ideally, all will be green. Otherwise,  correct anything that’s orange or red.  Occasionally, that won’t be possible or  sensible  -  and  that’s  ok.  You  will know best.  It’s simply automated feedback from a plugin - not Google itself - and for the most part very accurate.  Word Count Overall,  your  posts  should  have  a   to  appear minimum  of  500  words  relevant  in  Google’s  eyes.  Even  that number  is  pretty  low.  1000  is  where  it really  starts  for  SEO  purposes.  Google loves  long,  in-depth  content  and  won’t even  consider  anything  below  a  certain word count.   Indexing your Posts  For SEO purposes it is important to get your posts and pages indexed as soon as possible. “Indexed” means,  the  Google bots  have  crawled  and  catalogued  the page,  and  it’s  showing  it  in  the  search results.  An  easy  way  to  let  Google  know about new pages - or updates to existing pages  free  service  called  is  a   -    Pingomatic.  It will automatically “ping” your post as soon as you click “update”, and is an easy  way  to  speed  up  the  indexing process.  First go to pingomatic.com and enter your  site.  Then  go  to  your  WP  Admin board and paste:  https:  pingomatic.com  into   the  “Update  Services”  box  under Settings -> Writing:   To  check  whether  a  page  has  been   indexed,  enter  the  following  into  the Google search bar:  Site:YourUrl.com   Obviously  replace  “yoururl.com”  with your specific post url .    CHAPTER 3 - Off Page SEO   What is Off Page SEO?  Off  Page  SEO  describes  all  external factors that influence how Google views your  site.  These  can  be  grouped  into  3 main categories:   *  Traffic  =  number  and  length  of  visits to your site  * Social Signals  * Backlinks  Lets look at each individually:   Traffic Google  watches  how  many  visitors you  have  per  day  -  and  -  just  as important - how long they stay. If you get 10,000 daily visitors and they all leave within 10 seconds, Google will interpret this  as  low  quality.  This  is  called “Bounce Rate”.  In  the  above  case,  if  people  found you  through  a  Google  search,  Google will assume that your site is not relevant to  the  search  term  people  entered,  and your ranking will drop.  Your Google Analytics  account  will give you a good idea of your traffic stats and  also  where  your  traffic  is  coming   from.  Social Signals Social  Media  are  Google’s  biggest they  always  watch  competition,  so  what’s happening and trending there.  If your posts get a lot of likes, shares and comments - in other words, a lot of interaction  and  feedback  from  your readers - it sends a strong signal to the Google bots, that your content is relevant and important.   Without any social media interaction, ranking will be very difficult and it also looks  a  little  fishy  since  popular  and   relevant  content  is  always  shared  on social media.   Be sure to have a Social Media share bar,  ideally  a  floating  one,  that  stays with  the  text  while  the  reader  scrolls down.  A  good,  free  option  is  SumoMe which  you  can  download  from  within your WP Admin ares.  To   help  with   social  media interaction, invite readers to share your content at the end of each post or ask a questions.  More  on  Social  Media Marketing in the next book of the series.  The Click-to-Tweet plugin is another great tool to encourage social sharing. In   that case you use a quote from your post and make it available within your text to be tweeted by the reader, thereby giving you additional tweets and retweets.  Backlinks Backlinks  are  the  currency  of  the internet. Links control ranking, so this is   the most important area to apply.  Once  again  though  -  none  of  the above  will  have  much  effect  if  the  On Page Optimization isn’t done first. It all ties in together.  Make  it  a  habit  to  apply  the  points from Chapter 2 with every single article you  write  from  now  on,  so  you  are consistently  sending  signals  to  Google about:  1  what your site article is about 2   that  your  site article  is  relevant  and authoritative  3   has  a  lot  of  Social  Media  and  Comment interaction   What is a Backlink?  A backlink is a link from an outside  source pointing to your site.   Here are the most common backlink  sources:  * Other Websites * Social Media, incl. Youtube * Directory listings * Press releases * Forums & Bookmarking sites  These are the two parameters Google  will look at with each backlink:   * Relevance * Power  Relevance:  Lets say you have a dog sitting site, then  dog  or  pet  related  sites  would  be considered  law  office linking to your dog sitting site would not be relevant. The link can still carry some juice, but by far not as much as when the topics are related.  relevant.  A   Power: Refers to Domain authority  DA  and Trust  Flow   TF   which  we  covered  in the  Keyword  chapter.  The  higher  the DA and TF of the sites that are linking to you  =  “Referring  Domains”,  the  more   powerful the link.   As a rough guide - anything over 15 DA or TF is a decent backlink - higher than 30 or 40: very powerful.   Only few sites get past 50 or close to 100  and  those  are  usually  well  known authority sites like the New York Times, Apple, Harvard or the Huffington Post.  Another group of high authority links  are:  - .gov - .edu  These extensions are highly regulated   and  therefore  add  a  lot  of  trust  to  your site - from the Google bots’ perspective  =signals .  If you know someone who works at a .gov or .edu and can get you a backlink from  their  site,  don’t  hesitate  to  ask them.  Once  again,  Google  wants  to  see relevant,  whether  trustworthy and important.  your   site   is:   The  more  you  can  convince  the Google bots that you are the best choice for all three, the higher you will rank - and that’s really what SEO is all about.   There  are  numerous  techniques  to send  that  message  to  Google  -  some more legal than others - and a good SEO will know which ones to use - and when and how much.  Black Hat SEO for example, is pretty much about simulating powerful signals to  the  Google  bots,  e.g.  artificially creating  powerful  backlinks  through various  techniques,  thereby  raising  the stature of a site or specific article.  A common practice is to rent or buy  powerful backlinks.  All  this  has  to  look  completely   natural  to  not  raise  any  red  flags  -  and the Google bots in turn are constantly on the lookout for anything fishy.  Unless  you  intend  to  become  an expert SEO - and even then there is still a degree of risk - focus on the techniques taught in this book - or hire a trustworthy SEO  to  speed  things  up   not  cheap though…. .  Keyword  research  will  be  your  greatest friend - and consistent effort!  You can still rank if you give it some time  and  don’t  run  the  risk  of  having your site banned.   We’ll go over a number of perfectly legal, and very effective methods to get the ball rolling, so not to worry….  Best  of  all,  you  don’t  have  to  do  it yourself, but can outsource most of this to other people and I will share a few of the Fiverr and Konker gigs I use so you have a place to start.  A word of Caution: With SEO, be very careful whatever gigs  you  otherwise  buy.  They  all promise  the  world,  but  unless  you understand  exactly  what  they  are  doing and what the risks are, don’t let anyone touch your site!   Another  quick  note  in  this  regard: initially, as you start building links, your ranking  might  actually  go  down  or erratically jump up and down for a few weeks.  This is called a “Google Dance” and another  feature  of  Google’s  new algorithm. The purpose once again is to weed out phonies and unethical, spammy sites who might panic and respond with even more aggressive tactics.   So remain unfazed, let it play out and wait  2-3  weeks.  It  will  usually  calm down and settle around a certain rank.   With everything we know, Google is   still  very  much  unpredictable  and frequently  changes  its  behavior.  So  the best strategy as a beginner is to keep it simple, apply what you learn here on a consistent  basis,  give  it  time  and  then celebrate  when  you  see  yourself  at  1 for the first time.  It’s an awesome moment!  ….and with the right choice of Long  Tail keywords not impossible at all….   Backlinking Techniques  6 Simple Ways to generate Backlinks:  * Social Media Profiles This is the very first thing you should  do after you built your new site!  Set up several social media profiles with your Blog  “Brand” Name. Be sure to interlink the profiles, meaning mention   your other profiles in a post or tweet, or place  clickable  links  in  your  “About” section  wherever  that  is  possible  Facebook for example .  Example for Facebook post: “Hey  guys  -  just  letting  you  know about  my  knew  Twitter  page  at   place the Twitter link ”  Once again, this is about establishing trust. A solidly interlinked net of social media profiles sends an important signal to Google that you are a real, legitimate business or entity.   When you are brand new, they don’t know  you.  They  don’t  know  what  your   intentions  are.  If  you  just  want  to  spam people and make a quick buck or are out to spread good, relevant information.  By  setting  up  social  profiles  across the board - Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Linkedin,  Instagram,  Pinterest  etc  -  you are  spreading  your  brand.  You  are showing that you are the real deal - and you do what most new businesses would do to let the world know they exist….  * Directories & Associations Similar  concept  -  again  establishing trust  and  legitimacy.  Directories  can include  anything  from  Yelp  to  Yellow Pages,  especially  if  you  have  a  local   audience  or  directories  related  to  your field.   include   The  more  the  better  and  be  sure  to always  same information,  e.g.  exact  same  spelling  of your brand name, address  if you include a business address , website url etc.  exact   the   If you are looking to rank locally - or show in the maps - then you need to also list yourself on GoogleMyBusiness.  Same  goes  for  Associations  in  your field.  The  more  well  known  and established,  the  better,  and,  of  course, you need to be able to place a clickable link to your website in any profile.   Clickable  means  when  you  click  on it, you get sent to another page - links are usually blue and underlined.  Sometimes you need to add http:   in front of your url to make it clickable - on Youtube for example.  This is the gig I use when starting a new  site.  This  guy  is  a  pro,  100% reliable  and  he  does  all  the  work  for you. You get listed on 200+ Directories  = “Citations”  and that is another thing you  should  do  soon  after  building  your site  and  setting  up  your  social  media profiles.   * Press Releases Same  idea  as  above.  Press  release links usually stay only for a few months, but  can  give  you  a  nice  initial  boost  of link juice - and help you get noticed by Google.  This is a gig I occasionally use.  * Guest Blogging I talk about Guest Blogging at length in the 2nd book of this series. It is one of the most important strategies to grow your  blog  audience  by  leveraging someone else’s readership.   It  is  also  a  great  way  to  build   valuable backlinks!  Of course, you need to research DA and  TF  for  any  blog  you  consider  for guest posts and if the numbers are high, a powerful  backlink  will  be  a  nice  by- product of your guest blogging efforts.  That is - if - the link is “Do Follow”! -  Always  ask  the  blogger  and  if  isn’t, you are wasting your time.  Whoever sets up the link can decide whether the link is “Do Follow” or “No Follow”, the latter meaning that no link juice is passed on.  Guest  blogs  should  always  be  “Do   Follow”, but you need to make sure.  The  fastest  way  I  found  to  get  guest blogging  gigs  is  this  course  by  Jon Morrow, one of the top bloggers in the business.  It teaches you how to write, research trending  topics  and  most  of  all  how  to approach  and  pitch  to  the  top  blogs  in your industry. Best of all, it comes with a Little Black Book of editor emails for 100+ top blogs in all major niches.  I   rarely   recommend  courses  or spending  money,  but  this  is  one  of  the few  exceptions.  It  will  jump  start  your blogging  career  as  only  few  other   methods can. So take a look.  * Forums & Blog Comments Whenever you comment in a forum or leave a comment under a blog post, you can usually add your website.   This, too, creates a backlink to your site.    While  this  link  type  is  not  very powerful, it still adds legitimacy - if the forums  or  blogs  are  in  your  niche  =relevance   and  have  high  metrics  =authority .  Be sure though to leave only relevant comments  that  add  value  or  ask  a question. NEVER leave your website or   an  affiliate  offer  in  the  comment  text. Otherwise,  the  blog  owner  might  mark you  as  spam,  and  that’s,  of  course,  not the signal you want to send to google.  On  that  note  -  watch  carefully  who leaves comments underneath your posts. If  they  are  spam  and  you  don’t  delete them,  it  will  reflect  badly  on  your  site  =spammy outgoing links .  Be  sure  to  install  a  plugin  called Akismet to filter out spammy comments  and  there  will  be  a  lot…. .  That  will sideline the majority before they ever get posted.   * Donation Links Obviously,  treat  this  one  ethically,  but here is goes:  Charities  and  other  non-profits  cultural organizations for example  will often  list  donors  on  their  website,  and quite  frequently  you  can  include  a backlink to your site.  These  can  be  very  powerful, depending on the organization. Sites like The  Red  Cross  or  New  York Philharmonic have very high metrics, so can be good backlinks.  Often,  a  minimum  of  just  a  $1  is listed,  but  I  would  to  get   enough    recommend  to  be  ethical  and  make  a decent  donation  for  a  cause  you  really care  about,  rather  than  just  racking  up high power backlinks.  Up to you, of course.  relevance  to  Google.  But  even   If  possible,  try  to  stay  within  your genre  as  is  once  again important  if occasionally there is no connection, this will  still  get  some  link  juice  flowing your way.  * Ask for Links Make  a  list  of  everyone  you  know and see if they have a website or work   somewhere that does.   Then see, if some of those sites might be  relevant  to  your  niche,  check  their metrics  DA and TF as shown in the last chapter   and  if  they  are  at  least  10-15 ask them for a link.  Most  of  the  time,  they  won’t  know what  you  are  talking  about,  which  is great. Just tell them that you are learning the  basics  of  SEO  and  what  it  takes  to rank  in  Google  and  that  backlinks  are one of the most important factors. Offer to explain it to them as well, so they, too, can  improve  their  ranking  and  more often  than  not,  they  will  be  happy  to arrange it.    Even  if  you  have  friends  with  new sites,  exchange  links.  Over  time,  those sites  will  grow  in  authority  and  every little bit helps.  I  already  mentioned  .gov  and  .edu sites.  If  you  know  someone  connected with either, ask them, too.  Before you start any link building, be sure  to  read  the  chapters  below  about anchor   often triggered  by  one-sided  anchor  text ratios….   text  and  penalties   It   is  not  complicated,  but  very important to do right from the start to not   get yourself in trouble later on.  For additional link building, feel free to contact me. I offer a couple of SEO services and can otherwise point you in the right direction, without breaking the bank.  Also,  if  you  ever  need  a  Youtube video  ranked,  I  can  help  with  that  as well.   Anchor Text  What is Anchor Text?  “Anchor”  refers  to  the  link  text.  In  other words, the text that is on the link.   It’s  very  important  to  keep  anchor  text varied to avoid a penalty.  If you use the main keyword as your anchor  text  on  most  backlinks,  you  are likely  to  incur  a  penalty  as  it  looks unnatural  and  would  be  considered  an attempt  to  manipulate  the  algorithm  for   better ranking  another form of keyword stuffing .  It is therefore a subtle dance between a  sufficient  number  of  “Target”  anchors  =anchors using the exact keyword  and other types of Anchor text.  Anchor Text Types  Lets use the keyword Dog  Training as an example for a fictional site called DoggyHeavenDogTraining.com  Target Anchor As described above, a target anchor   uses the exact keyword = exact match,   Dog Training  Or  uses  the  exact  keyword  in  a  phrase = phrase match  Best Labrador Dog Training  LSI Anchor  Uses a synonym to the main keyword  Canine Obedience Class  Brand Anchor   Uses  your  brand  name  =  your  name  or your company blog name  Doggy Heaven  Naked url Anchor  http:  doggyheavendogtraining.com   or   doggyheavendogtraining.com  Generic Anchor   “Click here” - “more info here” and  Misc. Anchor  unrelated  words  within  the  text  as  similar  anchor  There is no one-fits-all solution, and anchor  text  ratios  vary  by  niche  -  for now, just keep them mixed.  For  important  backlinks  use  target  anchors and LSIs.   For  press  releases  and  citation  gigs   ONLY use branded or naked url anchor  never the target keyword . In this way, those  two  gigs  can  also  be  used  to spread  anchor  text  ratio  if  you  ever  get over-optimized  with  too  much  target anchor.  you   outsource   Whenever   link building  citation gigs, backlinking etc. , you  will  be  asked  to  provide  a  list  of anchors.  That’s what the above is referring to.  To give you a visual reference, this is an Anchor Text pie chart - which shows the  different  anchor   = different  colors   nicely  spread  out,  types   text    instead of one having the majority of the pie.    Most of all, in the beginning - don’t stress too much it! No one will penalize you with a brand new site. Just be aware of  the  rules  and  use  different  anchors throughout  your  link  building  -  and  you will be fine.   By  the  time  your  site  grows  and starts  ranking  on  page  1,  you  will  be much  more  experienced  and  will  know how to correct from there, if needed.   Google Penalties  I will briefly cover the current penalties and  how  to  avoid  them.  If  you  apply what  is  taught  here,  it  is  very  unlikely that you will ever have an issue, so don’t worry too much, but it’s important to at least know what they are about.  First  of  all,  there  are  two  different types  of  penalties:  algorithmic  and manual.   Algorithmic   triggered automatically  when  the  Google  bots crawl your site.   is   Manual means a human employee at Google has reviewed your site  usually triggered  by  an  alert  from  the  Google bots   and  found  it  in  violation  of  their policies.   Manual  reviews  will  show  in  your Google Search Console  under  “Manual Review”, so if ever you can’t find your site  entering site:yoururl.com  -  this  is  where  you should look next.  even  when   -  not    Manual penalties are not as frequent and  easier  to  fix,  but  either  way  you want to avoid penalties at all costs.  The  two  main  algorithm  updates  in recent years were: Panda and Penguin.  Panda Panda’s  1st  version  came  around  in 2011  and  focused  mainly  on  On  Page factors, in particular low quality content. This can be:  * very short content *  spun  content  -  yes,  there  are actually softwares who spin an existing text to be reused on another site.    *  Overall   low  quality:   lots  of spelling  mistakes,  grammatical  errors, cookie-cutter  or  copied   “duplicate”  content without any new impulses  *  Over-optimization:  in  particular,  keyword stuffing  Once  you  are  hit  with  a  Panda penalty, it will apply to your entire site, not just the page that triggered it.  Penguin Penguin’s  1st  version  was  launched in 2012 and focused mainly on Off Page factors,  in  particular  your  site’s  link profile.   Sites  with  unnatural  or  a   large number of spammy links were penalized or at least dropped in the rankings.  Very  importantly,  anchor  text  ratio became  an  important  ranking  factor. More  on  anchor  text  ratio  in  the previous chapter.  One  major  recent  update  included Penguin  4.0  which  made  the  Penguin algorithm  24 7.  Meaning  it  is  now running  constantly  and  not  just  once  or twice a year - which is good news!  Yes,  it  is  easier  now  to  get  caught, but it is also much easier - and faster - to get an algorithmic penalty removed.   In the past, when you were hit with a penalty,  you  made  corrections  and adjustments  and  then  had  to  wait  until Penguin was run again, which could be many  months.  Now  when  you  make  the proper adjustments and corrections, you can get your ranking back right away. So much better.  Other penalties include:  *  Mobile  Friendly  -  websites  now have  to  be  mobile  compatible  and  be fully functional on mobile devices  *  Top  Heavy  -  a  site  that’s  so   overloaded with ads that visitors have a hard time finding the actual content  * Payday - dubious payday loan sites  *  Pirate  -  sites  that  offer  pirated  and similar  content  How to recover from a Penalty?  Hopefully,  you  will  never  have  to ask that question, but if you ever do, this article  goes  in-depth  on  how  to recover  from  a  penalty  and  get  your ranking back.
