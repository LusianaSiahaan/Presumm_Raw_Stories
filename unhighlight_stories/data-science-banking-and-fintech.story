Everywhere,  things  are  in  flux. New, venture-backed arrivals are challenging the old powerhouses. Banks and financial services companies are caught between increas‐ ingly strict and costly regulations, and the need to compete through continuous innovation. How  does  an  entire  industry  remain  relevant,  authoritative,  and trustworthy while struggling to surmount inflexible legacy systems, outdated  business  models,  and  a  tired  culture?  Is  there  a  way  for banks and other traditional financial services companies to stay on budget  while  managing  the  competitive  threat  of  agile  newcomers and  startups  that  do  business  at  lower  costs  and  with  better  mar‐ gins? The threat is real. Can established institutions evolve in time to  avoid  being  replaced?  What  other  strategies  can  protect  their extensive infrastructures and win the battle for the customer’s mind, heart, and wallet? Financial  technology,  or  fintech,  is  on  fire  with  innovation  and investment. The movement is reshaping entrepreneurial businesses and  shaking  the  financial  industry,  reimagining  the  methods  and tools consumers use to manage, save, and spend money. Agile fin‐ tech companies and their technology-intensive offerings do not shy away from big data, analytics, cloud computing, and machine learn‐ ing, and they insist on a data-driven culture.  1   Consider a recent Forbes article by Chance Barnett, which quantifies fintech startup investments at $12 billion in 2014, quadrupling the $3 billion level achieved a year earlier. Adding to the wonderment, crowdfunding is likely to surpass venture capital in 2016 as a pri‐ mary funding source. And people are joining the conversation. Bar‐ nett  writes,  “According  to  iQ  Media,  the  number  of  mentions  for ‘fintech’  on  social  media  grew  four  times  between  2013  and  2014, and will probably double again in 2015.” All of this activity under‐ scores how technology is rattling the financial status quo and chang‐ ing the very nature of money. In this report, we examine the disruptive megatrends taking hold at every level of the financial ecosystem by covering:    An overview of the current banking industry   Key  participants  and  primary  targets  for  fintech  disruption, including  lending,  payments,  money  transfer,  wealth  manage‐ ment, trading, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies    Adaptive strategies of traditional financial organizations  Yesterday’s Bank: A Rigid Culture, Strapped for Funds Established  banking  institutions  are  strapped.  The  financial  melt‐ down in 2008 questioned their operations, eroded trust, and invited punitive regulation designed to command, control, and correct the infractions of the past. Regulatory requirements have drained budg‐ ets, time, and attention, locking the major firms into constant com‐ pliance  reporting.  To  the  chagrin  of  some,  these  same  regulations have  also  opened  the  door  for  new  market  entrants,  technologies, platforms, and modalities—all of which are transforming the indus‐ try. For  traditional  banking  institutions,  focus  and  energy  for  innova‐ tion are simply not there, nor are the necessary IT budgets. Gart‐ ner’s Q3 2015 forecast for worldwide IT spending growth  including all devices, data center systems, enterprise software, IT and Telecom services  hints at the challenge banks face: global IT spending is now down to -4.9%, even further from the -1.3% originally forecast, evi‐ dence  of  the  spending  and  investment  restraint  we  see  across  the financial landscape.  2     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   With IT budgets limited, it is hard to imagine banking firms easily reinventing  themselves.  Yet  some  are  doing  just  that.  Efficient spending  is  a  top  strategic  priority  for  banking  institutions.  Many banks are moving away from a heavy concentration on compliance spending to instead focus on digital transformation, innovation, or collaboration with fintech firms. There is a huge amount of activity on  all  fronts.  To  begin,  let’s  review  the  competitive  landscape  of prominent fintech startups. Lending and Payments: The Behemoths To say there is no innovation in the banking world would be a gross misrepresentation.  But  most  of  the  innovation  is  taking  place around the periphery of the financial mainland, not so much in core banking. Our first observation is clusters of venture-backed invest‐ ing  in  transactional  fintech.  Credit,  with  its  inclusive  functions  of lending and payments, is the mainstay pillar of the banking world and has been since the earliest times. Consumers will always need credit  and  will  always  need  to  make  payments.  The  sheer  impor‐ tance of credit and the huge volume of lending and payments trans‐ actions  worldwide  make  it  a  primary  target  for  opportunistic entrepreneurs. Even capturing a small slice of that huge revenue pie is alluring because it promises a profitable business. NextGen Lending A unique array of disruptors is jockeying for position, leapfrogging over debit and credit card processes, accelerating transactions with tap-and-go  technology,  reducing  the  need  for   if  not  altogether eliminating  cash, and reinventing financial services. While shaking up  the  tired  banking  space  with  fresh  competition,  some  new entrants  are  even  providing  a  special  way  to  impact  the  space  for social  good,  educating  consumers  and  welcoming  brand  new  seg‐ ments. They are indeed taking a bite out of legacy banking’s market share and profits. Some notable examples are listed here: Lending Club and Prosper  Leading the way are companies like Lending Club and Prosper, both  San  Francisco–based  peer-to-peer   P2P   lending  compa‐ nies billed as “marketplaces.” As financial intermediaries rather than  bankers,  they  have  created  a  Match.com–like  model  for lending, matching best of fit savers scenarios with correspond‐  Lending and Payments: The Behemoths      3   ingly  appropriate  investors.  Individual  consumers  and  small businesses alike can lower the cost of their credit and enjoy a better  experience  with  less  wait  time  compared  to  traditional bank lending. Investors  or savers, as they are now called  bene‐ fit from an advantageous risk-adjusted return. What is truly original about these new firms is their sophistica‐ ted data mining and analytics techniques. To gather information about a given applicant, they sample from a wide pool of infor‐ mation  sources,  including  social  media  profiles,  employment history,  GPA  scores,  and  modeled  future  earnings  potential. Rather than rely solely on financial or credit history, these lend‐ ers focus on applicants’ current finances and future potential to score their likelihood of being good borrowers. This big-data- meets-lending method reduces risk and optimizes best available rates for individuals or small businesses interested in loan con‐ solidation, borrowing, or investment opportunities.  This UK “marketplace” for loans follows the same operational and  business  model  as  Uber  and  Airbnb,  where  firms  do  not carry inventory or merchandise but rather connect thousands of people using nothing more than their own platforms and net‐ works.  Similarly,  Funding  Circle  operates  in  a  P2P  mode without balance sheet inventory and without taking on risk. Its value is in connecting participants  investors who want to lend money  with businesses that need capital. Not bound by reserve requirements, Funding Circle has loaned more than $1.2 billion in the past five years to thousands of businesses in the UK and the  US.  Per  Liat  Clark  in  Wired  Magazine,  the  main  benefit comes  down  to  reserve  requirements.  If  a  bank  wants  to  lend $100 billion a year, it would need $10 billion in capital. Because Funding  Circle  does  not  need  this  capital  up  front,  it  “creates incredible  amounts  of  efficiency,”  says  Funding  Circle cofounder Samir Desai.  Funding Circle  Kreditech  Kreditech  is  a  German  company,  not  yet  operating  in  the  US, that  has  come  up  with  an  original  way  of  scoring  individual creditworthiness.  They  offer  loans  to  individuals  based  on  an analysis of their online data, scored algorithmically. Like Lend‐ ing  Club  and  Prosper,  they  do  not  rely  solely  on  traditional credit rating information. Kreditech focuses on lending money  4     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   to  consumers  who  are  without  a  credit  score  and  who  conse‐ quently  don’t  qualify  for  credit  under  traditional  reporting mechanisms.  Kabbage  An online financing and data company, Kabbage has simplified the  manual  bank  loan  application  process,  offering  online financing  to  small  businesses  and  consumers  remarkably quickly. Using online social data and other tools for its under‐ writing decisions, Kabbage has helped thousands of customers who might otherwise face hurdles when financing through tra‐ ditional.  Originally  launched  in  the  UK,  Kabbage’s  analytics include sources such as business checking accounts, UPS ship‐ ping  data,  and  consumer  details  from  large  ecommerce  sites such as Amazon, eBay, and Etsy.  Additional entrants trooping in to take advantage of credit lending opportunities are such nimble marketers as OnDeck, ZestFinance, Fundbox, Planwise, Currency Cloud, Affirm, and Banking Up. Payments—Safety First Because payments touch virtually every sector of the economy, it is critical to provide security. A big hit with consumers is the fraud- fighting Europay, MasterCard, and Visa  EMV  chip that is becom‐ ing ubiquitous as it finds its way into the US credit card industry. Ron  Mazursky,  Director  of  Strategic  Initiatives  at  Jack  Henry  & Associates  and  an  expert  in  payment  systems  and  banking,  recog‐ nizes  the  chip  as  “the  next  generation  against  counterfeit  fraud  in credit and debit cards at point of sale.” The chip has been incredibly successful in Europe, with 90% of credit card terminals being EMV- enabled.  A  squareup.com  article  reported  the  UK  has  seen  a  70% decline  in  counterfeit  transactions  since  adopting  EMV,  or  chip, cards. Canada reports that losses from counterfeit, lost, and stolen cards  dropped  from  245  million  Canadian  dollars  in  2008  to  111 million in 2013. Meanwhile, credit card fraud is trending up in the US, where fraudsters have congregated because they can’t hack the chip cards used abroad. We can expect to see some needed improve‐ ments in this area. The US lost over $5.3 billion to credit card fraud in 2013, up 14.5% since 2012. The EMV’s claim to security fame relies on a tech feature—it houses a microprocessor chip that protects the card’s owner by blocking the  Lending and Payments: The Behemoths      5   capture of the account number at the point of sale and using a surro‐ gate. The EMV protocol is fast becoming a global standard provid‐ ing greater protection against the use of stolen account numbers. Another  development  in  the  battle  against  fraud  is  biometrics, sophisticated tools to authenticate true cardholders. Per Mazursky, “The  main  biometric  tools  being  developed  and  tested  are  finger‐ print scanning, voice ID, photo ID and retina scanning, and we are seeing these applications grow due to improvements in technology and the proliferation of smartphones.” The new iPhone 6, for exam‐ ple,  comes  equipped  with  fingerprint  ID  technology.  Mazursky continues, “A number of large banks have already implemented bio‐ metrics  to  identify  bank  customers,  including  USAA,  BBVA,  and others.” At  the  2015  Money2020  show  in  Las  Vegas,  biometrics  was  a  hot topic. This market is forecast to be worth over $117 billion by 2020, according  to  research  firm  Acuity  Market  Intelligence.  Vendors vying  for  a  share  of  that  revenue  and  looking  to  attract  would-be buyers were in Las Vegas to showcase their offerings to over 10,000 attendees. Cash Avoidance As  a  fundamental  financial  activity,  global  payment  transactions constitute  an  enormous,  growing,  and  profitable  area  of  banking. The average consumer’s banking relationship is dominated by mak‐ ing  payments.  Consumers  often  interact  with  their  banks  several times a day on payment-related matters, such as paying bills, buying financial products, or checking on a payment status. The frequency of these interactions make payments an excellent platform for cross- selling  other  financial  services—it  is  not  surprising  that  the  pay‐ ments sector is under disruptive assault, and that so many fintech upstarts are diving into the payments feeding frenzy. According to a McKinsey Global Payments Report  see Figure 1 , global payments grew 9% in 2014 and are expected to grow 6% per year for the next five years, compared to the 4% growth experienced in the preceding few years.  6     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   Figure 1. Past and predicted global payments revenue growth  image courtesy of McKinsey Global Payments Map, used with permission   Online payments While the systemically important financial institutions  SIFIs  were riveted by the financial calamities of 2008 and the enduring regula‐ tory aftermath, startups and new market entrants from Silicon Val‐ ley  crept  onto  the  financial  scene.  PayPal  may  have  started  the online payments revolution in the late ’90s, but its many followers today are looking to shake things up in a big way. Most  notably,  there  is  Square  and  Stripe.  These  companies  have extended  technology  to  physical  payments  and  other  value-added services  for  merchants  and  consumers,  and  thus  have  established roots in a market that banks used to dominate. They have raised the bar, changing customer expectations about banks, probably forever. Founded in 2009, Square offers diverse aggregator and mobile pay‐ ment services. Its Square Register allows individuals to handily enter card details or swipe their card through the Reader, a small plastic device that plugs into the audio jack of a supported smartphone or tablet, to read the magnetic strip. The platform, whose name implies “square  up”  as  in  settling  transactions  or  “fair  and  square,”  is  also notable  as  its  cofounder,  Jack  Dorsey,  is  cofounder  and  CEO  of another Silicon Valley heavyweight—Twitter. Fast, easy to use, and  Lending and Payments: The Behemoths      7   easy  to  learn,  Square  allows  merchants  to  accept  payments  within the same day. Stripe is a five-year-old payment processor, already valued at $5 bil‐ lion,  which  boasts  customers  like  Facebook,  Twitter,  Apple,  and Kickstarter. Stripe’s ingenuity is that it solves a real-world, practical problem  that  merchants  around  the  world  face—how  to  improve online  conversions.  While  consumers  spend  more  and  more  time browsing  on  their  mobile  devices,  their  actual  mobile-purchasing patterns  track  lower.  Stripe  provides  a  cleaner,  clearer  purchasing experience for the online consumer at point of purchase. Its social media play is using “buy buttons” on Facebook, Pinterest, and Twit‐ ter. With an ambitious goal of doubling in size and expanding into global markets, Stripe takes a unique approach to banks: it is work‐ ing with them, not against them. Currently, Stripe is engaged with American Express on a single-password solution for payments made across  multiple  channels.  It  is  also  working  with  Visa,  which  has invested in Stripe, to explore ways to drive a better customer experi‐ ence. Other  eager  entrants  crowding  into  the  payments  space  include WePay, Clinkle, Dwolla, Flint, Mint Bills, and Zipmark.  Money transfer Money transfer has historically been done through Western Union and MoneyGram. The last several years have seen the rapid intro‐ duction  of  P2P  money  transfers  using  online  or  mobile  technolo‐ gies.  Consumers,  already  familiar  with  PayPal   the  largest  P2P service  and SquareCash, quickly warmed up to new providers like Venmo, Popmoney, and Dwolla. Venmo,  now  owned  by  PayPal,  offers  a  way  to  send  money  from person to person through the Web. Linked through mobile devices to a customer’s bank account, which is a popular feature among mil‐ lennials, there is no fee if the money transfer is done through a debit card.  Popmoney  is  one  of  the  largest  P2P  providers  and  is  owned and operated by Fiserv. Financial institutions offer Popmoney as a service to customers on their checking account, but at times rebrand it or refer to it as an institutional service. Dwolla provides an online payment system and mobile payments network at an attractive rate. It is very active in the bitcoin transactions space.  8     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   These  companies  are  all  firmly  planted  in  the  fintech  transaction space, outside traditional banking. They supply a peripheral finan‐ cial  service  that  challenges  our  standard  consumer  banking  habits like using ATM cards, checks, and even cash. Does all this activity forecast the demise of cash? It may be too soon to tell. But with so many smart cards, mobile payments and other devices for facilitating cashless transactions, and products like Apple Pay and Google Wallet, the popularity of cash may very well be on the decline. Money itself is being reinvented by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Value Delayed, Not Denied: Money Management Another category of fintech firm, for money management, aims to provide full value in the future with increased adoption. Unlike the transactional group described above, where there is a fast exchange and clear growth in the present, this group of nontransaction-based firms  is  expected  to  provide  its  fullest  benefit  in  the  future.  More time is needed to record their value to the consumer and financial impact on the industry. Automated Investment Services In the past, financial advisors managed relationships with their cli‐ ents via one-to-one communications. That relationship has been a central feature of the wealth management and investment advisory product offering. Now, wealth management is becoming an automa‐ ted  process,  changing  things  drastically.  Sometimes  referred  to  as robo-advisors, these automated investment services appear to make investing  easy,  less  expensive,  and  even  fun.  With  lower  fees,  they use automation to select investments that meet clients’ risk tolerance and growth goals. They are increasingly popular, especially among millennials, and vary by cost, account, investment types, and taxes. Some leaders in this space include the following: Betterment  One of the bigger names in the space is New York–based Better‐ ment, which in 2014 raised $32 million in a Series C round that included such investors as Citi Ventures and insurer Northwest‐ ern Mutual. For less complex portfolios, algorithms can deter‐  Value Delayed, Not Denied: Money Management      9   mine the appropriate level of risk in bringing investment serv‐ ices  to  an  underserved  market.  Even  established  investment advisory  firms  like  Charles  Schwab  and  Vanguard  now  offer complementary  automated  advisory  services  with  their  tradi‐ tional offerings, thus extending their platforms to a wider group of clients.  Wealthfront  Another big player in the automated advisory services space is Wealthfront. Founded in 2011, it now has $1 billion under man‐ agement  of  its  proprietary  algorithms.  Its  CEO,  Adam  Nash, claims that the company’s growth is driven by millennial invest‐ ors  who  are  accustomed  to  software-based  services  and  who don’t believe that star investment managers can outperform the market. Wealthfront account minimums start at only $500. Mindful  of  the  successful  growth  of  these  upstarts,  old  guard firms  like  Vanguard  and  Charles  Schwab  launched  their  own robo-advisors  earlier  this  year.  After  only  a  few  months,  they now have assets under management  AUM  of over $20 billion. Because  of  their  massive  scale  and  full  technology  stack  as mature institutions, they can match or undercut competing pri‐ ces and offer a wider array of services that are nearly impossible for newcomers starting from scratch.  Other firms engaged in automated advisory services include Mint‐ Bills,  WiseBanyan,  Blooom,  FutureAdvisor,  Personal  Capital,  and Motif Investing. Exchanges and Traders The trading world is not exempt from disruption. A thriving group of fintech companies surrounds exchanges, hedge funds, banks, and proprietary  trading  firms.  Concepts  like  fairness,  simplicity,  and transparency—prevalent  in  the  fintech  space—are  edging  out  the complex, complicated, and fragmented setups of incumbents. Move over NYSE and AMX. The IEX Group, for example, filed with the SEC  in  2014  to  become  a  public  stock  exchange  and  has  received both  endorsements  and  investments  from  major  players  eager  to improve  the  structure  of  exchanges.  Led  by  Brad  Katsuyama,  IEX aims to level the playing field between high-frequency traders and ordinary traders. The firm was featured in Michael Lewis’ 2014 best- seller Flash Boys, which raised questions about the fairness of auto‐  10     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   mated trading exchanges catering more to the interests of financial intermediaries than the investors and corporations the market was designed to serve. Then there is LiquidLandscape, a San Francisco–based fintech busi‐ ness launched in 2014, which invites traders to “start a conversation with  your  data.”  Founders  Margit  Zwemer  and  David  Lin  melded their joint backgrounds in information systems, finance, math, sta‐ tistics, and economics to build fast, flexible, and intuitive real-time data tools for financial markets. LiquidLandscape features an engag‐ ing visual interface inspired by social media and gaming, but fueled by  big  data  technology.  Initially  targeted  at  traders,  LiquidLand‐ scape,  per  Margit,  “is  now  more  widely  promoted  inside  banks incorporating risk management and other operational functions, as well as retail lending and credit card data.” Figure 2 shows some of the  common  questions  to  be  answered  and  decisions  to  be  made when  a  startup  like  LiquidLandscape  approaches  a  new  market opportunity.  Figure 2. Typical issues for fintech product and market development  image courtesy of LiquidLandscape, used with permission   Other firms rocking the financial trading boat include Robinhood, whose mission is to make free trading available for everyone, thus democratizing the markets. Meantime, Quantopian is turning ordi‐  Value Delayed, Not Denied: Money Management      11   nary  people  into  hedge  fund  managers  with  their  crowdsourced hedge  fund  managers  and  freelance  quantitative  analysts  who develop, test, and use trading algorithms to buy and sell securities. And Anova Technologies concentrates on network connectivity sol‐ utions to optimize latency and capacity. Blockchain, Bitcoin, The Cryptos We are witnessing the dawn of a new age of technological distribu‐ tion, automation, and growth. Progress in the tech space has shifted us into the era of the blockchain. This technology revolutionizes the way we account for ledger-based transactions and encourages us to rethink the role of central banks and other intermediaries, as well as the protocol for trust and fiat currency, peer-to-peer networks, and shared control. Blockchain introduces new flows of value, impacts regulatory  frameworks,  and  opens  up  a  world  of  potentially  new applications. Founded by Nicolas Cary, Ben Reeves, and Peter Smith about seven years ago, it represents the next phase of the Internet’s evolution—the age of decentralization. A profound new distributed database  ledger,  blockchain’s  key  element  is  a  hash  or  bulletproof code that keeps information secret. The technology has given birth to a host of cryptocurrencies, the most prominent of which is bit‐ coin. R3,  the  consortium  working  on  a  framework  for  blockchain  tech‐ nology in global markets, now boasts 22 prominent financial insti‐ tutions. Development could not only spur further use of blockchain in  the  financial  sector,  but  also  cut  regulatory  costs  substantially because  of  its  transparency.  “For  emerging  markets,  blockchain technology adoption promises a boost to the standard of living to many of the unbanked in countries where, in many cases, good cen‐ tralized banking systems do not exist,” says Susan Joseph, a practic‐ ing  lawyer  turned  strategy  consultant,  adviser,  and  entrepreneur with an expertise in all things fintech. “Access to financial services should improve. However, its application does not stop with finance because  the  need  for  a  transparent,  trustworthy  digital  record  is huge.” Witness  Greece.  Facing  a  devastated  drachma  and  an  inability  to repay  its  staggering  debt,  the  country  agreed  to  test  the  first-ever digital  currency  ecosystem  in  the  summer  of  2015  on  the  remote, pine-covered island of Agistri. The pilot has ended, but the experi‐ ment  resulted  in  a  host  of  dos  and  don’ts  for  developing  a  digital  12     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   currency infrastructure. Clearly, blockchain is not yet ready for pri‐ metime, but holds much promise. Witness  voting  and  wills.  Susan  brings  forth  her  law  training  to reimagine additional uses of blockchain in the future: “Voting could be  tested  in  small  chunks  side-by-side  with  the  regular  voting machines to demo its integrity and then perhaps the technology will be  purchased  by  a  government  for  an  official  voting  operation.” Susan continues, “Another way to expand its sphere of influence is through wills. From a legal standpoint, these documents need to be timestamped and trustworthy. They could reside on your personal blockchain.  When  the  need  arises  to  probate  the  will,  it  could  be accessed,  trusted,  and  automatically  probated  through  smart  con‐ tracts executed on the blockchain because of the confidence and cer‐ tainty now made possible through this technology. For the idea to gain  traction,  probate  laws  would  have  to  be  modified  but  as  an orderly process and business template, wills could jumpstart a whole new use.” Canadian-based  entrepreneur,  William  Mougayar,  a  noted  block‐ chain expert, investor, 4X entrepreneur, and board member at OB1, has constructed an infographic depicting the Wild West blockchain ecosystem. Figure 3 shows 268 nontraditional financial companies in the global supply chain. Some of these firms are offering solutions to existing players while others are competing with them. How all of this will shake out remains to be seen.  Value Delayed, Not Denied: Money Management      13   Figure 3. The complex blockchain-based landscape of 268 companies within fintech  image courtesy of William Mougayar, used with per‐ mission  Going Bankless Technology  is  transforming  banking—it  is  shrinking  some  areas, eliminating others, and radically changing still more. Certain areas of banking are self-organizing, leaving no fingerprints on the crea‐ tive  ways  they  are  responding  to  enduring  market  and  consumer demand. The bank, with its network of brick-and-mortar branches, is becoming expendable while cash becomes, for some, an inconven‐ ience. The Non-Bank Bank As Bill Gates said years ago, “Banking is necessary. Banks are not.” Brett  King  certainly  agreed  with  that  notion  when  he  founded Moven in 2011 and wrote Breaking Banks in 2014. Moven’s mobile- centric banking app puts banks in the palm of the consumer’s hand —literally. It coaches users on how to better save money and essen‐ tially  bypasses  the  need  for  brick-and-mortar  branch  establish‐ ments. Another disruptive technology firm leveraging the growth of mobile tech and the omnipresent smartphone, Moven reinvents the  14     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   basic  checking  account  and  the  fundamental  relationship  between the bank and its customer. Toronto-Dominion  Bank  Canada  recently  partnered  with  Moven. The arrangement hints at the strategic direction some banks are tak‐ ing with respect to responding to customers’ current and anticipated needs.  The  bank’s  strategy  behind  their  partnership  is  to  build mutual strength and stability, create alliances where they lack scale, and take advantage of market share. Another  “non-bank”  bank  is  Simple.  This  group  originally  part‐ nered with several banks to provide a graphical user interface, but was purchased last year by BBVA  Banco Bilbao  and is now being integrated into their worldwide operations. These  firms  unsettle  the  standard  banking  habits  to  which  we  as consumers  have  become  accustomed—habits  like  maintaining checking and savings accounts, and even using physical checks. This begs  the  question:  what’s  left  of  banking  when  mobile  tech  puts banking in the palm of your hand? Shadow Banking Banks are no longer the only game in town. If banks can no longer provide credit with the necessary ease to fuel economic growth, then the market has sought—and found—other credit models and lend‐ ing  alternatives  that  will.  Witness  the  phenomenal  growth  of  the shadow  banking  market  outside,  alongside,  and  sometimes  even within,  the  regulated  bank  lending  industry.  The  term  “shadow” indicates that their loans are not regulated in the same way as con‐ ventional bank loans. Fueled by restrictions in the traditional lend‐ ing space and stringent Know Your Customer and AML compliance, shadow banking offers more accessible options and better costs than the traditional banking route. A top international banking executive, who agreed to be interviewed on condition of anonymity, estimated that the shadow banking market is now valued at over $80 trillion. According to a recent Bloomberg article by Ambereen Choudhury, the shadow banking system could take an $11 billion bite from tra‐ ditional lenders’ profits over the next five years. This is an example of a successful strategy to circumvent regulation and deliver value in both product and service to consumers worldwide.  Going Bankless      15   Rebuilding Core Fundamentally, banks need to retool. They need clean data in a reli‐ able architecture to mitigate operational risk and meet their report‐ ing  and  stress  test  requirements.  While  system  replacements  may not be feasible, upgrades are on the uptick. Deenar Toraskar, a well- recognized expert in market risk and big data solutions architecture, and principal at Think Reactive, summarized the magnitude of the predicament:  “The  data  required  by  the  regulators  do  not  fit  the relational model any longer. Traditional systems and architectures, current databases, middleware, messaging, and design patterns sim‐ ply  cannot  cope  with  the  new  regulations  imposed  and  the  data reporting  requirements,  which  are  on  an  order  of  magnitude increased.” Deenar  clarifies  that  the  situation  is  not  necessarily  hopeless,  as other companies—Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Netflix—have all tackled big data problems successfully. “Sometimes, it is hard to translate  these  technologies  into  the  banking  domain  where  the need for zero data loss and eventual consistency is not always suffi‐ cient; and banks have typically not been strong in adopting the open source model.” London-based  Elizabeth  Lumley,  who  was  part  of  Innotribe’s  first Power Women in FinTech Index and is currently managing director of Startupbootcamp FinTech, offers a potential solution. “To trans‐ form  the  industry,  there  needs  to  be  a  massive  overhaul  in  core banking,” she said. Legacy systems are not the only issue. There is legacy mentality as well, which translates to a gap between today’s banking practices and today’s expected consumer practices. Lumley notes that disconnect often  begins  at  the  front  door—in  the  procurement  department. “The best way to change the culture of banking is to overhaul the procurement department,” she says. “These gatekeepers limit access to outside vendors and suppliers proposing innovative products and services and who have a lot to offer, embedding new services into the financial entity or piggy-backing onto existing ones. But when you need five years of P&L, preferred vendor status and a long list of other requirements, it gets impossible. I heard an example where a major  bank  lost  out  on  a  promising  supplier  who  pulled  out  of  a deal  because  the  bank  was  too  old  fashioned,  too  traditional,  and couldn’t be dealt with!”  16     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   A  clever  workaround,  says  Lumley,  is  for  banks  to  “partner  with innovation  labs,  establish  direct  associations  with  them,  or  build innovation centers in-house to fund innovation drives. This is sepa‐ rate from the main bank IT departments—letting banks take advan‐ tage of new agile technologies without it impacting the core bank IT budget.” And  they  are  doing  just  that.  To  keep  pace  with  the  breathtaking velocity of innovation in the tech space, banks have moved outside their comfort zone. UBS has opened a dedicated innovation lab in London  to  become  a  closer  participant  in  the  new  ecosystem  and collaborate  with  upstarts,  startups,  and  the  investor  community. Credit Suisse has backed The Anthemis Group to scout digital tal‐ ent. Goldman Sachs has open sourced its proprietary GS Collections code, looking to make improvements and identify programming tal‐ ent. JPMorgan opened a technology hub in the UK to identify fresh tech talent, especially female engineering students, and has adopted an  agile  methodology  as  a  best  practice  for  tech  projects.  Both HSBC and Santander are investing: they have created separate funds that provide capital directly to fintech startups. All of these initia‐ tives modernize and strengthen their brands. Tech Is Coming for Banking It would be a narrow view to assume that the best and the brightest people,  innovations,  and  technology  only  come  from  within  an organization. Forging partnerships and closer ties with the outside world, and looking to fintech firms for inspiration and guidance is sensible,  adaptive  behavior.  Working  with  outsiders  provides  a learning  experience  that  prompts  cultural  transformation  or,  at  a minimum, cultural shifts. The rigid culture of banking, with its traditional silos of products, isolated  operating  groups,  and  humdrum  mentality,  is  changing. Looking  around  for  progressive  industry  leaders,  we  can  identify Lloyd  Blankfein,  CEO  of  Goldman  Sachs,  who  now  unabashedly describes  Goldman  Sachs  as  “a  technology  firm.”  Discussing  the future strategic direction of the firm with Michael Bloomberg in a recent interview on Bloomberg News, Blankfein said, “Twenty-five percent of our employees work in technology and it doesn’t stay still: you need technology to drive the business, to comply the business, to make sure the business is risk-managed.”  Tech Is Coming for Banking      17   One senior regulatory and compliance specialist, who spoke on con‐ dition  of  anonymity,  reacted  to  Blankfein’s  sentiment  by  saying, “Banks  have  always  been  reliant  on  technology,  but  thinking  this way changes their identity, helps people think in a completely new way. It changes their culture.” Rebrand, reposition, and rethink are the transformative mantras of a winning strategy. Will banks and other incumbent financial services companies heed the call? We’ll know soon enough.  18     Data Science, Banking, and Fintech: Fitting It All Together   About the Author  Cornelia  Lévy-Bencheton  is  a  communications  strategy  consultant and writer whose data-driven marketing and decision support work helps companies optimize their performance.
