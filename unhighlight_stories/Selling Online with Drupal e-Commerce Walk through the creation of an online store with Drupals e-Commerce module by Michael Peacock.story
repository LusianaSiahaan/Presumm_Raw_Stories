By integrating the store directly into the website, customers are provided  with a consistent experience with the other areas of the site.  Many aspects of Drupal and e-commerce are covered as well as the e-Commerce  modules to create not only a great online store, but also a great website.  What This Book Covers Chapter 1 introduces you to Drupal, e-commerce, and the advantages of using Drupal  e-Commerce rather than regular online shopping carts before going through the  installation process and performing some basic configurations. Chapter 2 looks at how to use Drupal and many of its Content Management features  to create a website. Chapter 3 goes through steps involved in planning an online shop including legal  issues, the shop's structure, product details, and how to take great photographs of  products for the store. Chapter 4 takes our planning from Chapter 3 to show you how to create an online  product catalog. Chapter 5 shows you how to manage users, roles, and permissions within Drupal,  particularly to create and manage customers to use the store, and staff members to  help manage the store. Chapter 6 takes a look at branding the website and the store to provide a website that  reflects your business.

Chapter 8 helps you to create an even better selling experience for customers by  looking at additional modules and features that can make the website and the overall  selling experience even better. This looks at adding images to product listings,  enabling search options and different ways of offering discount or incentive to  customers including bulk purchasing discounts. Chapter 9 takes a detailed look at taxes, payment, and shipping options allowing you  to accept as many different forms of payment as possible, as well as dealing with  taxation issues and calculating shipping prices based on the items ordered or the  location of the customer. Chapter 10 takes your new site, secures it, and deploys it onto the Internet ready for  use to generate business, as well as explaining how to maintain the shop. Chapter 11 looks at generating invoices and a more advanced way to manage your  customers, by installing a Customer Relationship Manager into Drupal to help  manage customer support, appointments, and even telephone calls. Chapter 12 gives you the knowledge you need to help promote and market your  business online by looking at optimizing the store for search engines, advertising  your site, and helping to bring back visitors to your site as well as some important  tips and advice when advertising, promoting, and marketing on the Web!

During the course of this book we are going to  look at how to use a content management system in particular Drupal as well as  its e-Commerce module to set up and manage an online shop. We will install the  software, have a look at its features, plan our shop, create our shop, look at customer  management, create a design for our shop, and cover security, taxes, shipping, and  even marketing our business.  In this chapter, you will learn:               What a Content Management System is, and What's Drupal What e-commerce is and what it can do for us What Drupal e-Commerce is, and why it is better than a regular online  shopping cart system How to install Drupal, perform some basic configurations, and install its   e-Commerce module How Drupal and its e-Commerce module work  We will also take a look at the store we will create during the course of this book,  Doug's Dinos.  What is a CMS and What is Drupal? Content Management Systems are one of the common methods for creating and  managing content on the Internet and on intranets, particularly in environments  where there is more than one person working on the content, or where there is a lot  of content involved.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  These systems generally have the ability for users to:               Create content Edit, delete, and generally manage content Manage, provide, and restrict access to view and edit the content Have a separate layer for design Collaborate effectively Manage versions of content  With a CMS, content and design are kept separate, which means that the design of   a website can completely change, and this will have no impact on the content of the  website. This is quite an important feature as it means that the design need only be  changed once, and not across each page of the website, making it easy for websites   of any size to easily and quickly change design, and it protects the design, as   content editors do not need to integrate design into their content—which could   cause problems.  [ 6 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 1  The diagram opposite illustrates the separation of these layers and how they are  brought together when the page loads into the visitors' web browsers.  Drupal is a free, open-source content management system, which allows individuals  or a community of users to easily publish, manage, and organize a wide variety of  content on a website. The Drupal website, containing lots of information on Drupal,  its history, and its features is http:  drupal.org .  What is E-Commerce and What can it do  for Us? E-Commerce is the process of conducting business, by means of the sale and  purchase of goods and services as well as the transfer of funds, over networks and  through computers. We will create an online shop that will enable us to do business  electronically over networks  the Internet  allowing us to sell goods as well as  receive payments electronically, although it can also cater for the option for manual  payments by cheque or money order.  E-Commerce can help us reach new potential with our business, making our  products and services available to a wider audience. It can of course do more for us;  it's just a case of where we want it to end! It can also:              Manage stock control Implement a better workflow of the sales process Enable us to accept business from new locations Enable us to process payments from customers who would have otherwise  been unable to purchase from us Help generate new business by offering more than just a shop—if we also  have a website with which our online shop is interconnected, then visitors to  our website will also be attracted to our online shop.  What is Drupal e-Commerce? …and why is it better than a regular online shopping cart?  Drupal e-Commerce is the combination of Drupal, the content management system,  and the e-Commerce module, which can be plugged into it, bringing a wealth of   e-commerce functionality to the software.  [ 7 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  If we consider websites that are purely shops, they provide the customer with one  thing—the opportunity to buy some products or services. Websites that are not at  all shops, generally provide information on a subject, and sometimes offer visitors  additional features or access to online communities. Drupal e-Commerce helps us  bridge the gap in a seamless fashion. Traditionally, if someone wanted a website that  had an online shop as well as a website, the two would be bolted together similar to  a garage being joined to a house. With Drupal e-Commerce we are not bolting the  two together, we are extending one into the other, similar to a new extension being  added to a house.  The figure above illustrates these different types of websites and shows that with  Drupal e-Commerce the shop and website are the same and interlinked, as opposed  to two separate entities.  With separate shopping carts bolted onto a website, they generally loose the  consistent theme of the website, and provide an added bonus for the visitor. We will  create an online shop and an online resource where each complements the other.  As e-Commerce is embedded into Drupal it allows us to make the most of a very  powerful CMS to improve the presentation of our products.  Our Site Doug is an avid dinosaur and model enthusiast, and runs his own shop and museum  selling model dinosaurs and offering information and facts on various dinosaurs.  He only has one property, and it's based a few miles outside the center of Newcastle,  a large city in the UK. Because his store isn't based in the center, he doesn't get as  much business from tourists and visitors to the city as he would like, and his main  customer base is school children in the local area; occasionally local schools make a  few bulk orders from him and bring a few large groups to see the museum.  Because Doug's business has been slowly declining for the past few years, he wants  to set up a website to advertise his store and museum but also to sell models online.  He hopes that this will increase his sales as he will be able to serve customers across  the globe, and also as tourists and visitors to the city will be more likely to find out  about his museum and realize it is only a short bus journey from the center, he may  get more customers for the museum too.

Installation Now that we know what Drupal and e-Commerce are, and we have a website and  shop to build, it is time to download and install the software. This section contains  some detailed technical information regarding requirements and installation steps.  This assumes that you have a development environment set up on your  own computer, e.g. WAMP, or XAMP. See Appendix A for details on  installing a development environment. We will deploy our shop onto the  web once it is ready in Chapter 10—Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining  Your Shop.  If you already have a development environment set up which differs from the one  detailed in Appendix A, you need to be aware of the requirements for both Drupal  and the e-Commerce module to ensure your development environment supports   the software.

More technical installation details are available in the INSTALL.txt file  in the folder we have just unzipped.  We now need to create a database, which Drupal will utilize; to do this we need to  visit our phpMyAdmin page within our development environment  see Appendix  A for more information ; typically this will be located at http:  localhost  phpmyadmin . On the page that loads there is a textbox for creating a new database;  let's call our new database drupalecom and then click Create to create the   new database.  Now that we have our database, we can run the Drupal install script; we will need to  have our database username and password to hand  see Appendix A if you used that  method to create a development environment . For most development environment  software such as WAMP and XAMP, the username and password is typically 'root'  with no password.  The Drupal installer can be accessed by visiting the Drupal directory in our  development environment, which is http:  localhost drupal-5.7 ; when we  visit this page Drupal detects that it has not yet been installed and will take us to the  installer page.  [ 10 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Here we need to enter our Database name, username, and our Database password,  so Drupal can connect to the database and install the default data. The two database  types we have are mysql and mysqli. mysqli is an improved mysql driver  hence   the i  but is not available on all installations; if you are in doubt, just choose mysql.  Chapter 1  Once we have entered that information, we can click the Save configuration button.  If all goes well, we should now see a screen saying Drupal installation is complete;  if not we will be taken back to the page shown above and informed of what  information was incorrect so we can adjust it.  If we now proceed back to our main Drupal directory, http:  localhost   drupal-5.7 , we can see that Drupal has indeed been installed and we are asked to  create the first account, which will be given full administrator privileges.  [ 11 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  To create this account we only need to enter a username and an email address and  then click Create new account.  You may see an error message on the next page, something along the lines of:  Warning: mail   [function.mail]: Failed to connect to mailserver at "localhost" port  25, verify your "SMTP" and "smtp_port" setting in php.ini or use ini_set   in   C:\wamp\www\drupal-5.7\includes\common.inc on line 1979. We don't need to worry about this error; it is just telling us that it failed to email the  administrator account password to us, which is understandable since we don't have  a mail server configured within our development environment. When we put the  website online in a live hosting environment we shouldn't have these problems.  The password that Drupal has generated for us is shown on the page with the error  message; we need to take a note of the password.  We also have an option of changing our account password on this page, and making  other changes to our account, including setting our time zone, and setting a signature  for our posts and messages.  [ 12 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   That's all there is to installing Drupal! Before we move on to the e-commerce module,  let's take a look at the basic settings available to tweak and change.  Chapter 1  Configuring Drupal We can get to the configuration settings from the links that are on the front page of  our Drupal installation.  The customize and configure link then takes us to the Site Configuration page,  which contains a range of different configuration sections:  Administration Theme The Administration theme allows us to change the theme and style of the  administrative section of Drupal, which isn't that important right now—it's more of a  personal preference for administrators.  [ 13 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  Clean URLs The mod_rewrite Apache module can allow us to enable clean URLs within Drupal;  this would change links from things like http:  www.example.com ?q=node 83  to something that looks more presentable to the end user, such as http:  www. example.com node 83. It provides no additional features or functions, but it does  make things easier for the user, allowing them to remember URLs more easily.   Let's click the Clean URLs link and enable the feature. If you don't have the   mod_rewrite module installed, the handbook page on Clean URLs link provides  more information on setting this up.  Within this page we only have the option to enable or disable the feature, but there  are a couple of useful links in there too.  The first link leads to some more technical details on the Clean URLs feature and  the second is a test to see if the feature can be enabled on our installation. Provided  we are running an Apache web server, and have the mod_rewrite module enabled   if you followed Appendix A, that is the case  the feature should work, so let's click  the test link. If all goes well, we should be sent back to the same page, but without  the links at the bottom. Doug doesn't like websites with "un-clean" URLs and wants  them to be clean. To enable this feature, we just need to click the Enabled option and  then click the Save configuration button.  Date and Time The Date and time settings allow us to set the default time zone. We will have to  enable it if we want users to be able to set their own time zones and the format in  which dates will be shown on our site.  [ 14 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 1  Although Doug's store is based in the UK, he is hoping to target users in other  countries too, and sees a larger potential with the US market, so he wants the default  time zone set accordingly to the US. Because there will be customers from the UK  and other countries, Doug also wants users to be able to set their own time zone,  so we need to ensure that feature is enabled. Let's leave the short and medium date  formats, as they are by default set to American style  mm dd yyyy .  [ 15 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  With these changes made, we just click Save configuration to apply the changes.  For future reference, we may wish to install the auto time zone module at  some point, to automatically adjust time zones with the user's time zone.  Error Reporting The Error reporting settings are for two main purposes:         Which pages to display if a page does not exist or the user is not permitted  access to the page How to handle technical  Drupal, PHP and MySQL  error messages  The error page settings are shown:  If a user is not authorized to view a page, or a page does not exist, then these default  pages will be shown to the user instead of the pages that they cannot access. As we  don't have any content in our site, we also don't have any pages to use as error pages  so we will leave these settings and return to them in Chapter 2—Getting Started   with Drupal.  The error reporting settings, however, deal with how Drupal should act if it  encounters an internal error, such as a missing file, a PHP error, or a MySQL error.  [ 16 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 1  Right now, as we are working in a development environment, we want to be  informed of all errors so we can fix them. However, when we put our site online,  we will have to come back to these settings as we don't really want to present our  customers with technical jargon and details. We will cover these again in Chapter 10—Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining   Your Shop.  File System The File system settings below determine where uploaded files will be stored and  how files are downloaded. When we first open this setting, there is a message in a  green box informing us that The directory files has been created [sic]. This is because  the folder was not created on installation, and the file system page detected that the  folder did not exist, so it created it for us.  It isn't advisable to move the file system path later when we have a live site running  from our installation, so if we do wish to move it, now is the time. The Temporary  directory is a folder used by the web server to temporarily store files that are used  or generated during the running of the website, for instance when users upload files  they go to the temporary folder before being moved to the appropriate place. We  don't need to change this setting as it should auto-detect the correct setting for us.  [ 17 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  The download methods allow files to be more secure. If we have files in our website  that we only want registered users to see, we can restrict access to them. If an  authorised user requests access, Drupal grabs the file and moves it to a temporary  location for the user to download. Doug's site will only have images or resource  papers to download, and these will be visible to anyone, so we don't need to change  that either.  Image Toolkit The Image toolkit allows us to control the quality of images that are generated on  the fly. One of the most common methods for image generation is GD2, which we  should have installed on our development environment. Drupal detects the available  image toolkit and provides us with the option to change the quality of the images.  Doug wants the highest quality possible of images and photographs, so let's ensure  that's set to 100% for him.  Imagemagick library There is the option to use the imagemagick library  although this may  require additional configurations on the server , this is faster than GD and  can handle images better. The image.imagick.inc file within the image  module folder contains more information and settings for this.  Input Formats When we enter content into Drupal the default setting is to process the input as if it  is HTML, so if we later created a page with content like:  This  massive  offer is only available for a short  while  Order  NOW!    [ 18 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Drupal would process the HTML from the input so the words massive and now were  bold, and the words order now were a link to the order page. The Input formats  section allows us to control who can enter input in different formats.  Chapter 1  The options available are:         Filtered HTML PHP code  Full HTML  With Filtered HTML only certain bits of HTML are processed, with PHP code  any PHP code added will be processed and with Full HTML the HTML will be  processed as is, with no filtering of potentially malicious entities. Generally users should not have access to PHP code as it is very dangerous. Only a  select few administrators should be given the option to use this. To allow other users  to do this, we need to configure roles within Drupal, which indicate which users can  do what. We will discuss these roles in detail in Chapter 2—Getting Started   with Drupal.  Performance The Performance settings allow us to optimize the performance of our Drupal  installation, which is particularly useful when we have lots of visitors to our website.  [ 19 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  For now, let's set Page cache to Normal as this is recommended.  Page caching prevents Drupal from loading and processing pages every time they  are requested, instead, it stores a copy of a processed page  known as a cached  version  and when anonymous users visit the site, who are less likely to use dynamic  elements that require processing, Drupal serves the cached page. With websites  under lots of strain, caching is very useful to reduce unnecessary load on the server  from many visits. The Minimum cache lifetime prevents Drupal from processing  the page too frequently, ensuring a cache is used for at least a specific amount of time  before a new, more up-to-date copy, is processed. This setting is more suited for very  busy sites.  Every time a user visits our site data is transferred from our web server to the user;  this data transfer is commonly within a specific bandwidth set by hosting companies  or service providers. Very busy sites can use lots of bandwidth, which can in turn  cost the website owners money. Drupal has some basic Bandwidth optimizations  available for us.  [ 20 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 1  These optimizations compress the style information of our website  CSS  using less  bandwidth on each page request. For Doug's site, he does not anticipate a massive  use of his website, so we will leave that Disabled for now; we can always keep an  eye on our bandwidth usage and if needed enable it later.  Site Information Information on the website is set in the Site information section, which includes:                 Website Name Contact E-Mail Address Slogan Website Mission Footer Message Anonymous User Default Front Page  Let's complete this information for Doug's site:  [ 21 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  We will call the site Doug's Dinos! Add Doug's email address as the contact email  address, and add Doug's cheesy slogan to the settings.  The website mission is just for the purpose of the website, and the footer message is  something appended to the bottom of this page, I've added a copyright notice, so all  of Doug's customers realize the website is copyrighted material.  The Anonymous user is the user name used to indicate anonymous users and finally  there is the Default front page, which tells Drupal which page in our site should be  classed as the front page. We will leave this as it is for now, and once we have some  content on our site, we shall return to it in Chapter 2—Getting Started with Drupal.  Site Maintenance The final section of settings is Site maintenance, which contains an option to turn  our website offline and display a message to the user.  [ 22 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 1  At the moment, our site is in a development environment so we don't need to turn it   Off-line; however, if we were working on a live site, it would be best to turn it   Off-line while making major changes to it, to avoid confusing the website visitors!  The Drupal e-Commerce Module E-Commerce functionality is not included with Drupal "out of the box", so we need  to download and install the e-Commerce module. Let's do that now!  Downloading the Module The e-Commerce module's website is located at http:  drupal.org project  ecommerce and the download link for the module is near the bottom of the page. We  want to download the file for 5.x-3.3 or a newer version if available.  [ 23 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  We also need another module, called the Token module. The e-Commerce   module depends upon this module, so let's download that from its project page  http:  drupal.org project token. We want the version for Drupal 5.x, which   is version 1.8  or newer; version 1.9 has subsequently been released  of the   token module.  The purpose of the token module is to provide an API  Application Programming  Interface—the ability for programmers to easily link their code into the software  for  text substitution and replacement within Drupal.   Installing the Modules We need to open the module files we have just downloaded and unzip their   contents into the modules folder within our Drupal installation, C:\wamp\www\ drupal-5.7\sites\default\modules, so that we now have two folders within our  modules folder. The modules folder may need to be created as it is not there modules folder may need to be created as it is not there   by default.  Now that the module files are in the correct location, we can go and enable the  modules in the Drupal administration section. This section is under Site building  and then Modules from the Administer menu.  [ 24 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   The modules page contains a very long list of module components contained within  categories; the new modules' categories that should be listed are:  Chapter 1               E-Commerce core E-Commerce customer interface E-Commerce payment methods E-Commerce product types E-Commerce uncategorized Other  The Token module is listed under Other, and as the Store module under   E-Commerce Core depends on it, let's enable the module by ticking the check box  and clicking the Save configuration button at the bottom of the page.  The only other module that we should install for any e-commerce functionality is the  Store module under E-Commerce Core; all of the other modules are required for a  fully functioning store; however, we will look at these individually later, along with  the functionality they provide and modules for which they are required.  If we then click on Save configuration we will have our store module installed along  with a few other modules that it installs for us at the same time.  [ 25 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Introduction and Installation  Playing Together We have installed Drupal and its e-Commerce module; now let's discuss what these  modules are and how they work together with Drupal.  On its own, Drupal is a CMS, that is, it is designed for managing website content.  Other than that, it does not do much. Additional features, which may not be needed  by most users and are not included in the main release, are written by the Drupal  community  or anyone really, who wants to write one  as modules which "plug in"   to our Drupal installation.  Modules can effortlessly be plugged into the system, and then removed from it later,  making it really easy to extend the basic system, and in our case, we are converting a  powerful content management system into a powerful e-commerce website.  The module developer's guide  http:  drupal.org node 508  contains advanced  information on the structure of modules, and information on how to write your   own modules.  Summary In this chapter, we had a brief look into what a content management system is,   what Drupal is, what it can do for us, and how it works in relation to the   e-commerce module.  We also installed and configured the Drupal content management system and  installed the token module and the e-Commerce module, and we are now ready   to enable some e-Commerce features in our website for Doug's Dinos.  [ 26 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Getting Started with Drupal  Drupal has a wealth of features available for managing content, so now that we  have installed Drupal, let's take a look at some of these features and how they work.  Drupal's features could fill a separate book in their own right and in fact they   do—Drupal: Creating Blogs, Forums, Portals, and Community Websites by David Mercer,  ISBN 978-1-904811-80-0 published by Packt Publishing, http:  www.packtpub.com  drupal book. Since this book primarily focuses on the e-commerce features, we will  quickly look through these features in this chapter; if you want more information  check out the other Drupal book from Packt. If you remember from Chapter 1, Doug  wants his website to be twofold:       An online store of products A wealth of information on Dinosaurs  In this chapter, we will focus on the information side of Doug's website and also his  business. Most of the content will be added using the built-in features of Drupal;  however, Doug wants a few extra content-focused features such as a contact form  and a blog, so we will create those too.  Preparing the Content Before we can start adding content to the site, we need to know what Doug wants on  his site, and then we can think about how to best implement the content into the site:         A home page A contact page A dinosaurs section     Containing sub-pages on individual dinosaurs  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Getting Started with Drupal  A museum section           Containing sub-pages on his museum  A blog  Doug has heard how blogs can help businesses, so he wants a blog  on his site.   Let's take an in-depth look at the various contents to be added to the site:  Home Page The home page will contain a short introduction to Doug's business and to the  website, which he had prepared:  Hello, and welcome to Doug's Dinos! We are the county's number one  model dinosaur store and educational resource on the Jurassic era.  We are based just a short journey outside the center of Newcastle and  have a fantastic range of model dinosaurs. Our newest range includes  high tech remote-controlled programmable robots perfect for guarding  rooms, scaring family and friends, or just for fun. Our museum is open  weekdays until 6pm and weekends until 4pm; see our museum section  for more information.  Contact Page Doug wants his contact page to serve two purposes; he wants the contact  information for his business, along with a contact form to allow customers to directly  contact Doug via the website.  Doug provided us the following content to go on the contact page:  Doug's Dinos Limited  17 High Street  Outskirts  Newcastle upon Tyne  NE9 9ZZ  Directions from Google Maps  Telephone: 0191 123 456 Fax: 0191 123 457  Email us: doug@dougsdinos.com  general  sales@dougsdinos.com  sales  related  support@dougsdinos.com  regarding your support plan   [ 28 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 2  Opening Times:           Monday to Friday: 9am - 6pm Saturday: 9am - 4pm Sunday: 9am - 4pm Bank Holidays: Closed  museum open by request of advanced  group booking   He also wants all enquiries sent through an online form to be sent to   doug@dougsdinos.com.  Dinosaur Section Within this section Doug has requested a structure listing each type of dinosaur to  have a separate page; a snippet of this structure is illustrated below:     Dinosaurs  general information on the eras when Dinosaurs existed   Museum Section Similar to the dinosaur section, we have the following structure for the museum  section of the site.     Our Museum  T-Rex Pterodactyl Triceratops Stegosaurus                    Tickets, Costs, and Opening Times     Special group offers  Photo Gallery Testimonials  [ 29 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Getting Started with Drupal  Content Management In order to create this content on the site we need to explore a number of different  features within Drupal, including:         Creating content Menu management Default homepage  Creating Content Creating content in Drupal is really straightforward. Once logged in, there is an  option on the main menu to Create content as shown:  The Create content screen lists all of the different types of content that we can create;  the list is dynamically based on the installed modules. By default we only have the  Page and Story options available; however as we have installed the e-Commerce  module in Chapter 1 we also have the option to add products.  Future version notice: This has been changed in e-Commerce version  4, which at time of writing is still under development; the Product node  type has been replaced with a new defined node, which can have product  types connected with it.  The figure above shows the content types available in the Create content menu.  Later on in this chapter, we will look into some of the other types of content that can  be created, by installing additional modules.  [ 30 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Pages and stories are similar in terms of the information submitted to create them;  however, stories post author information and the time the story was created onto the  site whereas, this is not posted with pages. If enabled under theme configuration,  pages can also be made to post this information; this is just the default behavior.  We will look at creating content again in Chapter 4 when we create our product  catalogue; however, let's have a brief look at it now so that we can create content.  Chapter 2  Title and Body The first two options when creating a Page are title and body as shown:  The Title is the title of the page, and the Body field is the main content for the page.  Input, Product, and Log Next we have Input format, Product, and Log message as shown below:  [ 31 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Getting Started with Drupal  The Input format defines how Drupal will process the content in the Body field    i.e. process as HTML, PHP code, or Filtered HTML ; for now the default will do; in  Chapter 4 we will explore these options in more detail. The Product option specifies if  the page will be handled as a product and if so which type of product. At the moment  we are just looking at content management and Drupal's general features, and are not  concerned with the e-commerce features just yet, so we can leave the default for that  option  the default is to not handle as a product . The Log message option allows us  to leave a note to other authors or administrators of our Drupal installation, so they  can see why we created the page or performed a particular operation.  Final Page Options The final options are:  The Comment settings allow us to decide if we want users to be able to comment  on the page; the options within available are: Disabled, Read only, and and Read Write.  Disabled disables the comments system for that particular page, Read only prevents  new comments being added to a page, and Read Write allows new comments to be  added as well as all comments to be read. The defaults for these can be set under  the Content types management screen. Because we are talking about content in the  context of a page, Doug does not want comments on pages; however, this may be  useful for products, to encourage reviews and discussion on products. The Menu settings define how the page should be handled in the various menus  available to us; within here we should enter a title of the page to be displayed in   the menu. Authoring information records the author of the page, and the time the page was  saved; this is mainly used by stories and not pages. Finally we have Publishing options, which allows us to define—if a page is  published or not, if we promote the page to the front page, if it is displayed at the  tops of lists  i.e. sticky , or if it is a new revision. Because we are only taking an  overview of the content management features, we will only be concerned with  content that is set to be published.  Now that we know how to create pages, let us look into menus and setting pages as  the home page, before moving on to create the content in our site.  [ 32 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Menu Management Menus make it easy and convenient to navigate between the sections of a website, so  it is important to be able to use our menus effectively. By default we have two menus:  Chapter 2       Primary links Navigation  With the default theme, primary links are displayed along the top of the page and  navigation links are displayed down the left-hand side of the page.  The image below shows the primary links menu on the default theme in our site.  The image below shows the navigation menu of the default theme in our site:  When pages are created, they appear in the navigation menu by default, although we  can change this later. Let us now look at managing these menus. In the navigation menu under Administer  Site building there is the Menus link,  which takes us to the menu manager. The navigation menu is as shown:  [ 33 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Getting Started with Drupal  This then takes us to the menu management page:  From here we can see the menus available, and the menu items within each. We can  create new menus using the Add menu option, and add new items using the Add  menu item option. Items can easily be reordered by editing the menu item and then  using the drop-down list to select where the item appears in the list. The menu item  edit screen is as shown:  Changing menu item position just involves selecting the item's parent item in the  menu, and altering the weight. The parent item defines where the item appears in  the hierarchy of the menu, and the weight defines in which order the item appears  compared to other items in the same level of the menu.  Default Homepage The page that acts as the default homepage within our site is set in the Site  information options, which can be found in the Site configuration section of the  Administer menu:  [ 34 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 2  Creating the Content Now that we know how to create content with Drupal, we can begin adding the  content we prepared earlier to our website!  Home Page The homepage involves two tasks:       Creating the homepage Setting the page as the default page  Creating the page itself is straightforward; we looked at creating pages earlier, the  only difference to what we covered there is that we should not list the page in the  menu  it will be the homepage after all .  Once we have created the page, we will be taken to that page. We then need to take  note of the page URL, so we can set it as the homepage. The page URL is as shown:  We need to take note of the section: node 16 from the URL, and put that into the  Default front page option in the Site information section.  We now have a homepage as shown:  [ 35 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Getting Started with Drupal  Contact Page Content can be created similar to the homepage, although when it comes to the  menu, we want the link to be the first one in the menu. To do this we select the  Parent item as Navigation, and then give the item a light weighting. I've selected  -10 as the Weight, in case we decide to add a lot more menu items later. The menu  setting for the contact page is as shown:  The contact page would also be appropriate on the primary links menu so we should  add it to that too. The Menu settings to add a contact page in the primary link is as  shown below:  [ 36 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Already our site is starting to take shape with something in our primary menu and a  second page to our site! We now have a contact page as shown:  Chapter 2  Dinosaur and Museum Sections These sections just involve more of the same creating content as before, although  we need to structure our menu a little differently to get the sub-pages to display  properly in the menu.  The Dinosaurs section has the potential to expand to contain lots of pages; however,  the museum page probably won't expand very much. Because of this it may be a  good idea to set the museum section to always be expanded, and the dinosaurs  section to only expand when we open that section. This should give us a menu  similar to the one shown below:  [ 37 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Getting Started with Drupal  Other Content Modules In order to have a contact form, blog, and photo gallery on the site, we need to install  or enable some other modules. The contact form and blog modules are preinstalled,  and just require enabling from within the Administer section of our Drupal  installation, whereas for the photo gallery we will have to find, download, and install  a separate module.  Contact Form First, let us enable the module; this can be done from the Modules section from the  Site building area of the Administer section as shown:  Once we have this enabled, we have a new item in the Site building menu called  Contact form:  From this section we can set up a contact form for our site, although it requires some  further configuration first. To set up the form we need to have at least one category.  The categories allow emails to be sent to different groups of people. Although Doug  only wanted the form to send things to doug@dougsdinos.com he did list a number  of other email addresses on the contact page. Because the contact form supports  categories, we can in fact incorporate all of these contacts into the contact form. Let  us add the categories from the Add category link.  [ 38 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 2  Categories have the following settings:               Category—Name of the category. Recipients—Email addresses of the recipients. Auto-reply—We have the option to automatically send a reply to those who  use the contact form. This could be useful to send a quick note of thanks,  along with a message about how long it would take to receive a response. Weight—It allows us to set where the category appears in the list   of categories. Selected—The final option sets if the category is the default.  We should create the following setup for the contact form.  Category  General Sales Support  Recipients doug@ sales@ support@  Auto-reply Yes Yes Yes  Weight 0 1 2  Selected Yes No No  When this is set up correctly we should have settings that resemble the following:  By default, users who are not logged in cannot access the contact form. This is  relatively simple to change, and just requires us to alter the role of anonymous users.  We do this from the Roles area within the User management section. This page lists  the different roles available; we need to click the edit permissions link next to the  anonymous user role. We need to enable the access site-wide contact form from the  contact module as shown:  [ 39 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Getting Started with Drupal  With that done, we now have a fully functional contact form, which all users can use;  it should automatically appear in our menu:  Blog The Blog module is a lot less involved than the contact form. Once the module is  enabled  the same way we enabled the contact form module , content can be   added from the Create content section. Within here there is a new option for   Blog entry, which appears exactly the same as a page or a story  they just get  processed differently .  I've set up a blog to use, and all of the other users, including Doug should be able to  set up their own with very little effort!  [ 40 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 2  There are other settings and options available for blogs, such as RSS feeds,  comments, permissions, and so on, but we will leave those for you to figure out on  your own if you wish to use the blog module.  Photo Gallery Adding a blog was really simple; unfortunately to add a photo gallery, which Doug  wants for his museum, is more complicated. This is because there are so many  different modules available including:         Flickr Gallery—integrates with your Flickr album Gallery—integrates with your gallery installation on the website Lightbox—can be used to create a Lightbox gallery  We can also create complicated galleries using views, Image Field, and Content  Construction Kit modules.  Doug is not sure how he wants his gallery to work, and is going to think about this.  We'll come back to it later, once we have looked into enhancing our store and adding  images to products.  Summary In this chapter, you have learned:           How to create content in Drupal How to manage menus in Drupal How to define our homepage How to create a contact form and a blog using additional modules  Now that we have looked into Drupal's fundamental features, let's move on to  planning our e-Commerce store, and looking into our product catalog in   Chapter 3—Planning Your Shop.   [ 41 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Planning Your Shop  We now have Drupal with the e-Commerce module installed, and we have a basic  understanding of how Drupal works, so let's start planning our shop. As well as  discussing some general planning advice, we will also plan our online shop,   Doug's Dinos.  In this chapter we will cover:             Things to think about when planning to sell online Legal issues that we need to consider The structure of the shop Things we need to convey about our products Ways to take photographs of our products to show them off to our   potential customers  Planning to Sell Online Selling online is similar in many ways to physical selling, both aim to sell products  or services to customers; however, online selling has a number of crucial differences  compared to physical selling.  With online transactions it is easier for someone to use a stolen card  no risk of CCTV  cameras catching them unlike in a physical shop  so we are at greater risk of fraud,  which could potentially result in more chargeback requests from purchases, which  introduce additional costs.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Planning Your Shop  A brief example of how this can be a problem, even with a genuine transaction—I  received a number of emails recently thanking me for ordering products from  various websites. The person ordering the products was not me, but shared my  initials, and must have entered the wrong email address. As it was my email address,  I could cancel the order, and in some cases log in to an account page of the company  to view the order. From here I could have potentially made more orders, since card  details may have been stored on file, or changed the shipping address. As for the  consumer, they would either have more than they bought or their items would not  arrive, and the seller would face charge backs and have an upset customer.  Our errors can cause great problems to our store. If we were to make a mistake with  a product description, we could get an increased number of returns, whereas with  a physical sale the customer would see the product for themselves and not need to  read a description  other than what may be provided on the packaging .  With selling any product or service, the customer is entitled to purchase the product  or service at whatever price is advertised, regardless of any mistakes in price. With  physical selling this is less of a problem:  It may just be on one product whereas with an online store, a price mistake  carries through to every single one of those products, even if there are  hundreds in stock. In a store, a customer could easily ask if the price is correct for an overpriced  item, whereas an online buyer would be more likely to just abandon the site! We would be more likely to notice these issues while we are walking around  a shop we are working in, but with the website, we may only check it now  and again, or only check the administration areas.  Besides the software that we have already downloaded and installed, there are  other things that we will need to get our online store up and running. The other  technical requirements will be discussed later in Chapter 10—Securing, Deploying, and  Maintaining Your Shop.  Legal Issues As with most things in business, and in life, there are a number of legal issues we  need to be aware of and consider:  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Disability Discrimination Act  1995  UK , and general Accessibility guidelines The Distance Selling Act  UK  The Companies Act  UK                    [ 44 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 3         Trade Descriptions Spam Laws  most countries  Data Protection  many countries  and privacy policy  Nothing mentioned here should be considered as legal advice, if you are  uncertain about any of this information, or for full details about the laws  applicable to your business you should seek professional legal advice.  Disability Discrimination A number of countries have legislation in place to prevent discrimination against  those with disabilities  for the UK this is the Disability Discrimination Act 1995,  and for the USA the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . These are in place to  ensure a wide range of rights for those who have disabilities  such as equality in  employment  but also to ensure access to facilities, premises, and information. In  the same way that provisions should be in place to allow visitors with disabilities  to access our store, this affects visitors to our website. Blind or visually impaired  users may use screen readers to hear the content of websites. We need to ensure our  website is standards compliant  so it can be interpreted by as many web browsers  as possible, including screen readers  so that the information is properly displayed.  Websites that use frames cannot be interpreted by some browsers and screen readers,  and with table-based layouts sometimes the content is read in the wrong order.  Distance Selling Many countries have regulations in place to govern distance selling, for instance  in the UK the Distance Selling Regulations govern the sale of goods or services to  consumers over the Internet, digital TV, mail order, telephone, and fax. These laws  state that the seller must provide certain information to the consumer and also allow  for cooling off periods. For more specific information you should look up or seek  advice on the law in your country or region.  Companies Act and Trust With recent changes to the Companies Act in the UK, websites must clearly state  information such as company number, VAT number, and registered office on  websites and emails. Even if this is not a legal requirement for your business, it is  strongly advised to provide this information to your customers about your business,  including its status as a legal entity and also any contact details. At the very least,  this conveys an open message to consumers, so they feel more secure in dealing with  your business.

Many countries have trade description laws to ensure product information is  accurate, and what the consumers' rights are with respect to incorrect descriptions  and pricing. You may already be aware of such laws if you have a physical store;  these laws are important and you should look into them in more detail.  Spam Laws Because our store will be online, we will most likely be taking our customers' email  address when they order online, and using this to send emails—be these emails  regarding their order, or promotional marketing. Because of the overwhelming  amount of spam emails being sent, many countries have imposed laws regarding  emails that can be considered spam. Generally, you can only email individual  marketing promotions to those individuals who have agreed to receive them and  they should have the option to opt-out  businesses are often a different case ,  although many websites still send spam even when they are a reputable company. In  2003, the US introduced the CAN-SPAM Act to regulate the sending of spam, email  content, and methods to allow recipients to unsubscribe.  Privacy Policies and Data Protection It is important that we tell our customers exactly what data we will be collecting  from them and what we will be doing with it. This should be in the form of a privacy  policy; templates of these can normally be purchased from legal sites for a nominal  fee, or directly from solicitors or lawyers. Some countries also impose data protection  laws, which govern what data you can collect and what you can do with it. In the  UK for instance, there is the Data Protection Act, which even defines that data can  only be used for the intention it was initially collected for, and recommends various  security procedures for safeguarding the data collected; there is even a registration  process to register as a data controller.  General Planning We have looked briefly at the legal issues and one or two other issues; now let's start  planning the shop itself. The shop we will be creating throughout the course of this  book, as discussed in Chapter 1, is Doug's Dinos—a shop selling model dinosaurs  and also providing information on dinosaurs through the rest of the website.  [ 46 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Product Types There are three main types of product that are sellable using Drupal e-Commerce:  Chapter 3         Apparel—clothing e.g. T-Rex T-Shirts Shippable goods e.g. model dinosaurs Non-shippable goods e.g.          Services—Dinosaur repair and repaint Media—Downloadable booklets on dinosaurs for teachers to  use in lessons Privileges—Customers could pay to access other areas of   the website  As our shop is mainly concerned with model dinosaurs we will be mainly selling  shippable goods and creating those types of products; however, we will also look  into the other types, so we can see how to use them if the Doug's Dinos online store  wishes to offer repairs, services, or premium content at a later time.  Although apparel is intended for clothing, it provides an additional feature to  standard shippable products, and that is sub-products or variations. These allow us  create variations of the same product, but with different attributes, such as color, or  size, and set a surcharge for these sub-products.  When going through the product lines of your own shop, it is important to work  out which types of products you want to offer, and also if you can offer products in  one or more types. For instance, if we were to sell downloadable booklets or books,  we may also wish to sell tangible, hard copies of them to our customers. We will go  through the product lineup for Doug's Dinos later in the chapter.  Product Groupings As well as the type of product we can offer, we also need to think about grouping  products together into categories. Drupal's provisions for categories describe them as  vocabulary, terms for describing the piece of content  the product listing .  When trying to relate our product lineup to our shop, we need to consider the  best ways to categorize our products, but also alternative ways of categorizing our  products. With a physical store, you would generally have a particular product in a  particular area of the store, for instance at a supermarket milk would be in the dairy  section, however with an online store this is not a limitation! What if we also wanted  milk next to breakfast cereals? This is not a problem with online shops!  [ 47 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065                        Planning Your Shop  It is worth thinking of the product's primary category, the section of the store where  it will get the most attention, and also the secondary categories, where it may not get  as much attention, but where it may be considered supplemental to other products  within that category.  Product Information Our website will need information on the products themselves; the standard details  available for all product types in Drupal e-Commerce are:  Product Product description Price Anonymous purchasing policy—Do we want it so that only registered users  can buy the product? Stock Keeping Unit  SKU —This is an ID number for the product from  another system. For instance, if we had our online shop tied into a central  system with our physical shop, we would use the product ID from the main  system  e.g. a stock control product  as the SKU. Add to cart link visibility—Do we want the link for adding the item to the  shopping cart hidden or visible?  For Apparel and Shippable goods we also need the following information:  Inventory control—Do we want to show the stock levels on the site, and  allow items to be sold out? If yes, we need to set a stock level. Availability estimate—General time frame for the item to leave the  fulfillment centre once the order has been placed.  With product variations for apparel products we can create additional attributes; for  example, we could create options for different sizes, colors, or materials. We can then  specify any weight difference or surcharges that apply to the product variation.  Planning Our Shop Now that we know the information that needs to be collected we should   investigate our own product line and the best ways to promote our products. In  Chapter 4—Creating Your Product Catalog, we will put the catalog we have prepared  in this chapter onto our store!  [ 48 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 3  Product Lineup For our store we will mainly be selling model dinosaurs, so let's start with those, and  prepare and collect the appropriate information. Here we are going to describe just  a few sample products; you should think up a few of your own, and collate them in  a spreadsheet for later when we start adding products to the shop! If we have them  prepared in advance, then when the shop is ready, we will know what to add to it.  Sample Product—Shippable Goods For our sample shippable product, let's take a model T-Rex. We want to keep our  product name short, yet descriptive, so something like "T-Rex with sound effects   1m " would suffice. We don't want to overload the customer with information in the  name, yet we want to leave it so the customer will want to read more on the product.  For the description we don't want to say something such as "1m T-Rex dinosaur,  Red, with sound effects and motion sensors allowing it to roar whenever someone  enters a room". That description is very dull, and only describes the bare minimum,  and reading it makes it seem like even we don't know much about the product!  Something like this would be more appropriate: "Our 1 meter scale model of T-Rex  model: TR15  is bound to scare anyone,  especially with its new motion sensor, which sets off a lifelike 'Roar'. This model  is a must-have for any model dinosaur lover; it is made of durable, shock resistant  plastic complete with fantastic hand-painted detail. This model requires two AA  size batteries  not included  and comes with a 6-month guarantee; we think you  will love this product—but if for whatever reason it falls below the standards  you expect, we are happy to offer a no-fuss 30-day money back guarantee. Any  questions just call us on 555-0135. Emma from Newcastle said 'This dinosaur was fantastic! I bought one for my  brother and he just loves it, especially when an unsuspecting visitor to his room  gets a nasty shock!' " With that description you can see that not only is the product described in detail,  but also technical aspects  such as battery needs  are described. This could link into  a page offering low cost batteries for sale. We also mention about our refund and  guarantee policies, which can be linked to directly from the description.  There isn't much to say about the price really! For this product, we will have a price  of $94.99.  We will add the product, and a few others to our store later in the book!   [ 49 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Planning Your Shop  The Anonymous purchases policy can be a little tricky to decide upon, as both  restricting and not restricting purchases have advantages. If the user needs to  register, then they may be put off by the process, but alternatively they will have  signed up to the website, and will most likely be able to receive an e-newsletter. For  products where there is no real need for them to be a user on the website, it is best to  allow anonymous users to make a purchase. For the SKU we could use the reference number, a reference number for a stock  control system for the main shop, or just leave it blank. Its main use is when the  system is tied in with another system, so we don't really need to think about these   at this time.  If this product is not yet available, i.e. something we expect to get soon  but  potentially may not get  then we would want to hide the 'Add to cart' link. This  dinosaur is one of our star products, so we should leave a note not to hide the link. If we wish to show these products are in stock, we can enable Inventory control—so  we would put a note in that column in our spreadsheet  where we are collating this  information  if it is Enabled; we also need to enter the amount that we have in stock. There are also a number of options available for how long we estimate the product  will ship, these include: within 24 hours, 2-3 days, 1-2 weeks, 4-6 weeks. Since these  models are one of our star products, and we have loads ready in stock to ship, we  would say within 24 hours.  Sample Product—Non-Shippable Goods Out of the box provisions for non-shippable goods are similar to the other two  products without variations, stock control, and availability. A sample product could be repairs on damaged products. "3-year repair plan on  Model T-Rex" described as: "If your model becomes damaged during the next  three years, we will repair the model back to its original condition if you have  purchased this plan. This is subject to our acceptable damage policy, and the  customer must pay shipping costs to the repair center." With this product we may actually want it to only be available to members, i.e.  people who have already made purchases, or signed up to access our pages with  help and support for the products. It is also worth noting that this type of service  could be grouped with the models themselves.  [ 50 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 3  Sample Product—Apparel For our sample apparel product, let's have a T-Shirt with a picture of a T-Rex on it.  As before we want a short and snappy name, which is also descriptive, so something  like "Children's T-Rex T-Shirt" would suffice. Although we will specify sizes  separately, as variations—I've described this as a child's shirt as we may have some  shirts intended only for adults or children.  We need a useful, description for the shirt, but we don't need to go into as much  detail as with the model dinosaur. I'm going to use: "Our high quality 100% cotton T-Shirt sports a detailed T-Rex on it, along with a  witty slogan on the back 'T-Rex T-Shirt'. It is machine washable and available in a  range of colors and sizes." I have purposely omitted the actual sizes and colors from  the description as when we create variations of this product, they will share the   same description. Cost: $18.95 As before, we have no real need for anonymous users to be restricted from  purchasing, and we also don't really need the SKU value, and the add to cart link  visibility should depend on if we have the product or if its something we hope to  add to our lineup in the future. Stock control and availability estimate are the same  as with shippable products  as apparel is also shippable! .  We can create variations on these products; the variations have weight and surcharge  provided, and provisions to add any attributes we wish. So we could have:  Colors: Red, Black, Brown and Sizes: S, M, L, XL, XXL. These would probably be  the same cost  so no surcharge  and similar weight. Additionally we could have a  variation that glows in the dark, which would then incur a surcharge.  Getting the Message Across The description of our product is very important; it should make the product  appealing to potential customers and also cover technical details. It may be useful  to look into professional copy-writing services to get the most out of your product  description. Below are some useful tips and suggestions for professional content.        Be honest, truthful, and accurate—This not only helps building trust with  customers if they know you are honest with your products  particularly  useful for returning customers  but it is also the law in many countries.    See Trade Descriptions earlier in this chapter.  Keep the content plain and simple—We don't want a description that  confuses the potential customer!  [ 51 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Planning Your Shop        Provide additional information—If your product has specific specifications,  such as computer software or technical equipment, make sure you mention  as much of that as possible, in addition to the more friendly descriptions. Visualize your customers—Imagine your average potential customer, and  write as if you were describing it directly to them.

Bill Fryer Copywriting Tips, http:  www.billfryer.com info info4.html.  A Picture Says a Thousand Words Further down the line we will add photographs to our product listings. Here are  some advice and tips to consider when taking photographs, which will help take  great pictures for your store.  These tips were provided courtesy of award-winning photographer  Martin Baker who has a website dedicated to photography and image  engineering: www.merrillvalleyphotography.co.uk.  Equipment The camera and support equipment we use are very important. Camera We don't particularly need an expensive camera, but the following features really  will be helpful:     A camera with a resolution of 3 Megapixel will be sufficient, especially if  you are able to fill most of the image with the product. A higher resolution  camera will allow you to compose more freely, cropping the image later   to size.  [ 52 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 3           An optical zoom helps you compose your shots. Ignore quoted values for  "digital zoom" as these settings operate by using a relatively small area of the  sensor, which you can do more easily and to a higher quality, in   post production. The ability to adjust such settings as aperture, ISO, and white balance will  make a big difference. Such adjustments are now available on many compact  digital cameras. Finally, your camera should have a remote control release so you can fire  it without touching the camera. If this is not possible you can use the delay  timer  which can usually be set to either 2 or 10 seconds delay .  Support Equipment While it is possible to take good product shots with the camera handheld it is more  convenient to have some sort of support for the camera. A small tripod is perfect.  Failing that, rest your camera on a sturdy table or with a pile of books so that it  cannot move between shots. Use the remote control release  if available  or the   delay timer to fire the shutter so you do not move the camera as you are taking   the photograph.  Camera Settings Cameras often have lots of settings available; these are optimal settings which should  be used: File Format Higher-end cameras may offer a number of file formats in which to save the  photographs  e.g. RAW, TIFF, JPEG . RAW can offer more flexibility in post  processing the images but for most purposes choose JPEG. File Size and Resolution Choose the largest resolution available on the camera as this uses the full recording  capability of the sensor. Quality Set the highest quality available on the camera. Lower settings throw away some of  the information recorded by the sensor. Sharpening Choose the lowest degree of sharpness available. It is much more effective to apply  sharpening in post production. If you are not planning to do any post processing,  you may want to use a slightly higher setting. [ 53 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Planning Your Shop White Balance This setting is used to match the predominant lighting in the photograph. If there is  an "auto" setting you can try that but you will get more reproducible results if you  use one of the "preset" values  Daylight if you are using daylight; Tungsten if you are  using one or more table lamps to light your product . ISO This setting is equivalent to "film speed" in film cameras. Use the lowest value  available. This will mean you need a slower shutter speed but as your product is   probably!  not moving and your camera is on a tripod or other firm support, this  will not be a problem. Program Settings If your camera offers a "close-up" or "macro" option try that, though you may need to  move the camera close to the product for it to focus correctly. Focus Sharp focus is critical in product shots. Take care to focus carefully, and if your  camera has an aperture  f-stop  setting, set it to a high value  e.g. f 8, f 11 or higher   as most of the depth of the photographs will be in sharp focus. Remote Control or Delay Timer Set the camera to use the remote control  if available , or the delay timer to fire the  shutter, so you do not move the camera as you are taking the shot.  Setup In addition to the camera and the settings on it, the environment can make a big  difference to the quality of the photographs. Lighting Do not be tempted to use the camera's own  onboard  flash as it is likely to be far too  powerful at close range and will cast ugly shadows.  Either using daylight by setting the product up near a window or using normal  adjustable table lamps, preferably one either side of the product to reduce shadows  would work. Note that you will need to set the camera's white balance  see above   depending on the source of light you are using; otherwise the colors of the product  will not be reproduced faithfully.  [ 54 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 3  Reflector If you are using just one light source  a window or just one table lamp  then use a  reflector  piece of white card or aluminum foil  to reflect some of the light onto the  shadow side of the product to reduce the harshness of the shadows. Background The simplest background is probably a white or plain colored wall. For a more  professional look, use a long sheet or roll of paper. Stand the product on the paper  and lift the back of the sheet so that there is a curve of paper behind the product. Light Tent If you are going to take a lot of product photographs it will be worth investing in   or making  a light tent. This is a box or frame structure with the sides made of thin,  light-diffusing material. With the product inside the box and the lights set up outside   shining through the sides  you should be able to get very high quality shots with  well-controlled shadows.  Post Processing This covers anything you do to the image from the moment you take the photograph.  Some cameras offer limited options in-camera but post processing is usually  something you do to the image after you have uploaded the file to your computer.  Many cameras come bundled with image editing software or there is a wide range of  free or shareware software available on the Internet. Commercial packages such as  Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Elements or Paint Shop Pro are also available.        You may need to adjust the exposure  brightness  of the image. This is  especially likely if your camera has automatic metering and you are using  a white or light-colored background. In this case the image may require  brightening a little. If this happens repeatedly, see if your camera has an  exposure compensation setting. If so, set it to +1 2 or +1 to force the camera  to overexpose the image. A low level of sharpening will probably improve your image but take care  not to apply it too strongly. Look carefully at the edges in your image after  applying sharpening. If you can see a distinct "halo" around your subject you  have sharpened the image too strongly.

Think about what versions of the image you need: perhaps a small,  "thumbnail" image of 60x80 pixels, a medium size of 300x400 pixels and a  large size of 600x800 pixels. Save the file you have been working on, then  using the software resize the image down to the largest of the sizes you need   600x800 pixels in this example . Save the file in JPEG format with a different  filename from the original file from your camera. Resize down to the next  size  300x400 pixels  and save as a new JPEG file. Repeat again for the  smallest file  60x80 pixels .  How Not to Advertise a Product? Quite a lot of small businesses with online shops don't put much effort into their  website and store—with many of these sites the amount of effort they put into their  site is apparent; however, a good amount of time in initial preparations should mean  that we only have to put in minimal maintenance time in the future, and still have a  fantastic store for our customers. These examples are ones that I have found on real  websites, but have been recreated to ensure anonymity.  Example One—Detail The following example illustrates a completely useless product description   and listing:  The product name and description are both the reference number for the product,  probably taken from the manufacturer's own catalog. The gray box would be a  photograph of the product—but it doesn't really add to the quality of the listing!   Example Two—No Photo Photos are really important—if you can go through the trouble to describe the   product—photograph it! Otherwise it looks like you are describing it in detail   and not showing the photo because the description is incorrect.  [ 56 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Example Three—Spot the Difference? Some shops list every model of product—which is fine, but what many don't do is  differentiate the models. They use the same photograph, the same name, and write ey use the same photograph, the same name, and write  the different model number next to it, leaving the customer wondering why there is r next to it, leaving the customer wondering why there is  a price difference.  Chapter 3  Can you spot the difference in terms of product advantages? You would need to  actually read the full information page on each product—which would turn off any  customer! If at a glance they could see one had flashing eyes, whereas another had  motorized legs, it would be much easier!  Customer Service One of the most important aspects of any business is customer service; this is even  more important with online stores where the customer does not feel reassured by  physical contact and immediate response to questions i.e. they have to wait for a  reply to an email rather than asking an assistant at a physical store.  Without a proper customer service systems in place, an online business will quickly  crumble, because:  Poor customer service leads customers with bad experiences not returning. It leads to a bad reputation for the business. Essentially losing money!  So, let's look at the best ways to ensure quality customer service:  Be clear about guarantees, refund policies, and replacement policies. Be flexible with these policies; if a customer who has used our store many  times wishes to return an item, which would normally not be allowed, it  may be more viable to accept the return  causing a small loss  to ensure the  customer has a positive overall experience, and is encouraged to continue  coming back.              [ 57 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Planning Your Shop             Have as many contact methods available as possible, and make sure it is  easy to get those details from the website. If a customer wants to know more  about a product and they can't even get your contact number, they may  abandon their shopping cart  which could contain a number of items  and go  elsewhere. If a phone number is on every page of the site with a message like,  Have a question? Just give us a call on 555-0135, the customer immediately  sees how they can get their questions answered there and then so that they  may proceed with their order. Payment Options: Make it clear which payment methods are accepted. After-purchase care: Offering support for products once they have   been purchased. Communication: The user needs to be clear at every stage of the website how  they are progressing through the shop, how they can cancel their order, and  they ideally should be contacted at least by email once their order has been  placed and dispatched.  Another important part of customer service is dealing with complaints—it is  important to show the customer that you have a system in place for dealing with  complaints; this could just be the main business phone number but with a mention  that it's used also for complaints, or a dedicated email address. This shows the  customer that you are happy to listen to complaints, and use the complaints to help  improve the business, and shows that you care for the customer, valuing their input!  These policies and procedures should be carefully planned out before your store  goes online, so that as soon as it does go online, the systems are in place ready  for excellent customer service and a professional, trustworthy service is ready for  customers immediately.  Summary In this chapter, we have looked at a wide range of issues involved with creating  an online shop, and doing business online. We have discussed some legal and  professional issues, how to promote our products, how to photograph them to get  the most from them, and taken a look at some sample products. We have also looked  at some examples of how not to advertise a product online—to ensure we avoid  some common problems. With this knowledge, we should be able to prepare our  business policies, consider the legal issues in more detail, and collate the details of  our own catalogs so as to know exactly what we will be selling.

In this chapter, we will cover:         Creating pages for products Creating packages of products The shopping process for our users  Further e-Commerce Configuration In Chapter 1, we installed the Drupal e-Commerce module, and enabled the Store  module. This is essentially the minimum to classify the module as installed. We now  need to enable more of the e-commerce modules in order to give us the features we  need for our store. The modules that we need to install are the E-Commerce Product Types modules,  which allow us to create a range of different product types. The available product  type modules are:                   Apparel Auction Donate EC Media File Product Generic Product Parcel Product Tangible Product  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  Of those modules we only need to install the following:             Apparel File Product Generic Product Parcel Product Tangible Product  To install them, we need to go to the Administer menu in our Drupal installation,  select Site building and then choose Modules. From here we can then tick the  appropriate check boxes for the modules before installing them by clicking   Save configuration:  [ 60 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   While installing these modules, we may be prompted to install some additional   sub-modules, which these depend upon:  Chapter 4  To proceed we click on the Continue button.  Creating Products Now that we have the appropriate modules and sub-modules enabled, and we also  have a list of products to add to our store as discussed in Chapter 3—Planning Your  Shop we can start to add these to our Drupal e-Commerce installation.  A product for our site is just another form of content, and can be created from the  Create content section of our Drupal menu; from here we can create a Page, Story,   or a Product:  Let's start by adding our Dinosaurs! These are shippable products.  [ 61 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  Creating a Shippable Product The sample Shippable Product we discussed in Chapter 3—Planning Your Shop was  a T-Rex model, so let's add it to our store! We should start by typing in the products Name and Description  both of which are  mandatory fields :  After the first sentence of the description I have typed the line  .  This allows the text to split depending on the page we are on. If we are on a list  of products, we will only see the first sentence, but if we view a page containing  information on the product, we will see the entire description.  If we enable or install one of the rich-text editors that can be used in  Drupal  such as TinyMCE, WYMEditor, or FCKEditor , the break function  will not work. If you have these modules installed and wish to use the  break function, you will need to turn off the rich text editor.  [ 62 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   By default, only certain HTML tags can be used in product descriptions in the  Filtered HTML option, if we wish to use more HTML tags later then we need to  select the Full HTML format from the Input format section of the form.  Chapter 4  Next we can type in the Price of the product and select a Renewal schedule:  There are no renewal schedules in the list, as we have not defined any. A renewal  schedule defines how often stock should be renewed for a product.  [ 63 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  As this product is available to anyone and not just someone who has a user account  with Doug's Dinos  i.e. like repair services  we should set Anonymous purchasing  policy for this product to be Flexible, which states that: Customers can choose to  register, login or checkout anonymously.  The catalog number for the T-Rex in Doug's supplier's catalog is TR001, so we  should enter that as the SKU. It is not important, but it may make things easier if we  were to integrate additional systems with our e-Commerce store at a later time. We  also want visitors to be able to buy this product so we should have the 'Add to cart'  link set to visible. If we are always going to have a surplus in stock, then there is little point in enabling  the Inventory control feature; however, Doug only has a small amount of stock, and  would like to be able to keep tabs on his stock. So let's enable it and set the initial  number in stock as 25.  [ 64 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 4  As Doug has a fair amount in stock, and does not expect overwhelming demand, he  will be able to ship the product within 24 hours, so let's use that option! The final option on the page is a Log message; this is just a tab to leave notes for other  administrators of our Drupal installation to say what we have done. Let's just write a  note to say We have added a T-Rex product, and then click the Submit button.  The Finished Product If we look at the front end of our Drupal installation we can see the finished product!  [ 65 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  Creating a Non-Shippable Product In this section let's make two types of non-shippable products:       Repair service—For repairs on damage to models. Education information sheets—Information booklets, which can be  downloaded on purchase. This requires a few extra modules to be installed.  Repair Service The repair service product is just a standard Non-Shippable Product from the list  of product types. The options available for a Non-Shippable Product are nearly  identical to those in a Shippable Product with the following exceptions:   	 No inventory management options   	 No availability estimate Creating the Product Let's start with the Name and a brief Description of the product, and its Price:  [ 66 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 4  Out of the remaining options the only one that may need altering is the Anonymous  purchasing policy for this product. This is because visitors who purchase this  service should already have purchased a dinosaur from Doug's Dinos and so should  ideally be a registered user. We should set that to Registered only, before clicking  the Submit button. The End Product The end result of this product looks like this:  Education Information Sheets Although educational information sheets are non-shippable products, we may  wish for the end product to be a file for the user, which they can download. This  unfortunately is not within the default Non-Shippable Product option; however,   we installed the File Product module, so we will create it using that. Creating the Product Files used by the File Product types are stored in the default files directory for  Drupal, which is set in Administer  Site Configuration  File system in the main  menu. The file that we want to include needs to be uploaded into this folder, which  by default is called files. It is often advisable to set this folder to be outside of the  Drupal installation folder, to prevent any unauthorised access to the files stored  within. We should upload our file to this location using an FTP program such as  Filezilla  http:  sourceforge.net projects filezilla  .  Similarly for standard non-shippable products, inventory management and  availability estimate settings are not available for File Products, but there is a new  option for setting the file we wish to use.  [ 67 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  Doug wants one of his products to be an "info sheet" on the T-REX, so we should  upload that using an FTP program and then link it to the product here:  A list of files that have been uploaded can be viewed by clicking the list of files link  under the File path text box. Unfortunately there are no provisions for selecting the  file and it populating the box; we have to type  or copy  the name into the   box manually. The Final Product This is what the end product looks like; let's also see what it is like to purchase one of  these products.  Once this has been purchased and the order subsequently approved, the file is listed  for us to download in the My Files option from the navigation menu:  [ 68 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 4  Creating Apparel The major difference with an Apparel Product compared to other product types  is that we can create variations of a single product, be they different color, size,  material, pattern detail, or any other attribute we decide. The product we are creating is a Children's T-Rex T-Shirt.  Creating the Product Creating the product itself is just the same as creating a normal Shippable  Product; all of the options are exactly the same. So let's create the product using the  information we discussed in Chapter 3—Planning Your Shop:  [ 69 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  This then creates the standard product for us, which is a product in its own right:  Now we need to create the variations on the product.  Creating Variations The Product variations option is in the Administer menu under E-Commerce  configuration:  [ 70 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   We have no variations at the moment, so to add the variation we need to select the  product type, which is Apparel Product:  Chapter 4  This page then lists all of the variations for Apparel products, but since we don't  have any variations yet we need to click the Add variation link to create a   new variant:  A variation only has two options: a Variation name and a Weight. Let's create a  variation of Color  and later a variation of size ; the Weight option isn't actually  related to the physical weight of the product but its weight in any menu or list   within Drupal.  Items with a higher weight sink lower in menus and lists and items with lower  numbers float up nearer the top of the menus and lists.  [ 71 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  Now that we have the variation, we can create and assign a number of attributes  to the variation. We do this by clicking the Add attribute option, which has now  appeared since we have a variation:  For the Color variation we should create attributes for all of the colors in which the  T-Shirt is available:  In addition to being able to set an Attribute name and Weight as with the Variation  itself, we can also include a Surcharge. This may be useful for sizes of T-Shirts, if  we have an uncommon size such as extra large, we may wish to add a surcharge for  extra production costs incurred.  [ 72 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   We should create a number of Color attributes, and also a variation for Size,  complete with a number of appropriate attributes for it:  Chapter 4  Although we have created these attributes and variations, we need to assign these  variations to the products themselves, as some variations and surcharges may not  apply to all apparel items. We need to go to the Products page  from the products item in the navigation menu   and click the Subproducts link on the details page.  From here, we can click the Add link, which allows us to generate the appropriate  attributes for the product.  [ 73 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  Here we enter the number of each of the items that are in Stock, tick the boxes of the  items that we wish to generate and then click on Review options at the bottom of   the page.  Finally we can review the generated list, to ensure the combinations of variations  and stock numbers are correct before clicking the Generate button. The Apparel Product is now complete!  The Finished Product The product page now has two drop-down lists, one for Color and one for Size, the  data for which is taken from what we just generated:  [ 74 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Grouping Products Products are grouped into what Drupal e-Commerce refers to as parcels. A parcel  can be purchased by a user, which may give the user a discount for purchasing these  products all at once, or just the convenience of purchasing a group of products at  once. This is in itself a product type for which we installed the module at the start of  the chapter.  Chapter 4  Grouping the Products Doug wants to have a special offer on his T-Rex model and also its service plan with  a $15 saving on buying both together. To create the parcel, go to the Create content menu, select Products and then  Collection of Products. The options on this screen are almost the same as a   Non-Shippable Product  no inventory control or availability estimates because they  depend upon the individual products within the package  but it has a field for the  list of all products. The ID numbers are the ID numbers assigned by Drupal to the  product not the product SKUs that we can set our self. The list of created products  can be viewed by clicking the list of all products link under the Product IDs   text box:  Once this is created we have a product that looks just like a normal product. It may  be an idea to include links to the individual products in the description; otherwise it  does not contain much information like the one shown below:  [ 75 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  Our Store Let's take a look at our store, as it stands, in action!  Product Listings The products are all displayed on the Products page    http:  localhost drupal-5.7 products :  Product Information The product information page contains more information on the product  as defined  by our use of the   line in our description ; additionally we can add the  product to our shopping cart from this page.  [ 76 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Adding to the Cart We can add the product to our cart, which also provides us with a link to the  shopping cart:  Chapter 4  The Shopping Cart The Shopping cart lists the products we have requested to purchase; we can adjust  the quantity  Qty  of the products and Remove them, and also check out the   products within.  We need to work on our store more before our visitors can fully Checkout and place  orders, but essentially we only need to enable payment options to start making  money with our store!  [ 77 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating Your Product Catalog  Summary In this chapter, we looked at the products and product types we discussed in   Chapter 3—Planning Your Shop, and added them to our store in the form of a product  catalog; we also created some new products including a downloadable file and a  parcel of multiple products.  With our catalog set up, users can:  View products View more information on the product Add the product to their shopping cart View their shopping cart Check out their cart  They can't however:  Make payment Receive tax or shipping information                  Now it is time to move on to look at our customers, and how we handle them in   our store.  [ 78 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff  There would be no point in running an online store without customers, so let's take a  look at our customers and how they are managed using Drupal.  We will also take a look at staff members, who are also users within Drupal. Doug  only has a small workforce; however, he wants them all to be able to help him out  with his online store!  Within this chapter we need to take a look at the two sides of users in our store:        Users, roles, and permissions—After all, customers who register for our site  become users and staff members who manage the store will also be users. Customer and staff management—How to plan, set up, and manage these  users, and managing customers who are not registered users.  Users, Roles, and Permissions Firstly, let's take a look at how users, roles, and permissions work in Drupal; then  we will use this knowledge to set up our website for customers and staff members.  These settings can be found in the Administer section of Drupal, listed under   User management:  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff  Roles and Permissions On their own, users have no permissions; instead permissions are grouped  into Roles, which are then assigned to users. All registered users who log in,  automatically receive permissions from the authenticated user role  which is  available by default  combined with additional roles that we decide to assign to  them; users who are not logged in or are first time users are considered anonymous.  The two default roles available are:       Anonymous users Authenticated users  These roles can be edited but they cannot be renamed nor can they be deleted  because they are used automatically by Drupal; that is why the operations column in  the table below is locked:  The permissions primarily relate to users being able to manage and administer  individual modules or sub-modules within Drupal.  There are four main types of access control used in various permissions:             Access—This allows a user to use a module but not change how it functions. Administer—This allows the user to change the function of a module and  should only be given to trusted users, and certainly never to anonymous users. Create—This allows the user to create specific types of content, but not edit  the content they create. Particularly useful if we were to have a user purely  for creating products. Edit own—This provides the user with the ability to modify content they  have created, for instance being able to edit products the user has added.  [ 80 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 5  Settings and Rules We have a number of User settings available for managing. These are:           User registration settings—This allows us to decide who can create user  accounts and who must approve the user accounts. User e-mail settings—This allows us to customize the content of emails sent  to users when they register, request a new password, or have an account  created for them. Picture settings—This allows us to decide whether users can upload a  picture in their profile.  These settings are found under User management  User settings:  User Registration Settings Let's take a look at them in a little more detail. Firstly, we have the User registration  settings to define how new accounts are created and approved:  [ 81 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff  The settings selected in the preceding screenshot specify that visitors can create their  own accounts and they don't require administrator approval. For Doug's site, this is  the option I would recommend. If we had set the first option, then we would have to  create user accounts for customers who wanted their own username, which would  make it very difficult for customers to become users in our site. The final option  allows visitors to create accounts but requires an administrator approval on the  account. In an e-commerce situation this is certainly not recommended; if we have  a user ready to pay we would not want to tell them to wait until someone approves  their account. Underneath those three options is a check box that states Require e-mail verification  when a visitor creates an account. This option will require that the user validates  their email address before they can log in for the very first time. With this option we  can reduce the number of fraudulent user accounts created, ensuring they are all tied  to a valid and active email address.  User E-Mail Settings Emails are automatically sent when:           A user signs up An administrator creates a username A user signs up but their account needs an administrator approval A user requests a change in password  The content of these emails can be changed from the User e-mail settings. There are  a number of variables used in these emails, including ones that become the users'  username, their password or the log-in page of the website. These variables are  described beneath each individual email, and are prefixed with an exclamation mark.  [ 82 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   When a user signs up, these variables are replaced with their user details and sent to  them as an email, which is shown below:  Chapter 5  Picture Settings If we enable Picture support then users can upload photographs to be linked to their  user account. The settings related to Pictures include:                   Picture support—This is used for enabling or disabling picture support. Picture image path—This is the subdirectory in the uploads directory where  we will store pictures. Default picture—This is the URL for a picture to be used if a user has not  uploaded any picture. Picture maximum dimensions—This is the maximum size in pixels   for pictures. Picture maximum file size—This is the maximum size in kilobytes   for pictures. Picture guidelines—This is a notice displayed on the upload form; this  would be useful for us to provide instructions to users or a disclaimer,  regarding the copyright of images uploaded.  Pictures could be useful in particular for staff members; we could give them special  pictures to indicate they are all members of the staff. A default picture that indicates  the user is a customer would prove useful when new users sign up. These would  work particularly well in conjunction with a forum that displays the user's picture.

To do this we need Taxonomy Access Control. Taxonomy Access Control is not available by default, so we would need to   install the Taxonomy Access Control module, which can be downloaded from:  http:  drupal.org project taxonomy_access. Once downloaded and uploaded  to our site, it can be installed from the Modules section within Site building:  What is Taxonomy? Drupal's taxonomy module allows us to tag content into categories and   sub-categories with terms  like using custom labels . A long description of the details  of taxonomy within Drupal is found on the Drupal website: http:  drupal.org  node 22274. For our application, we can think of Drupal's taxonomy purely as a  way to group content into categories.  Creating Categories Within the Content management section of the Administer menu there is a  Categories section, which allows us to create vocabularies and terms to categorize  our content.  Within here there is a link to Add vocabulary; this allows us to create the category:  [ 84 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   We can also select the content types we want to associate with this vocabulary  or  category as we are concerned :  Chapter 5  Once we have our vocabulary created we need to add terms to it:  There are other options when creating terms, but we are only concerned with the  Term name for our usage of taxonomy:  Categorizing Content Once categories have been created we need to categorize the content; different  vocabularies are listed in the Edit section of the Page content along with the terms  associated with them.  We can select the term and then save the page.  [ 85 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff Restricting Access Based on Taxonomy  Access Control Under User management we have an option called Taxonomy Access: Permissions,  which allows us to set the taxonomy access permissions for a particular role.  The settings available for these roles provide permissions for:             Viewing content  View  Editing content  Update  Deleting content  Delete  Tagging content with a term  Create  Listing the categories within the content  List   [ 86 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 5  For the View, Update, and Delete settings we can set the following permissions:          Allow all—Grants the appropriate permission to the user. Ignore all—Denies the appropriate permission to the user, but can be  overridden by other allow permissions. Deny all—Denies the appropriate permission to the user.  The drop-down list at the top of each group can be used to set all of the permissions  below it to the same setting.  Customers Now that we know how Drupal's users, roles, and access permission features work,  we can create our customer groups, and look into customer-related settings that may  be of use to us, as well as some basic customer management.  Customer Roles Doug wants a couple of different roles for his customers:       All customers Support plan customers  The general roles won't provide any real extra features, but will be used to classify  customers. However, customers can purchase a special support plan, which provides  them access to additional areas of the site.  The support plan customer role will allow users to see a number of extra pages and  features, which other users will not be able to see. This is a support resource that  Doug wants to provide to customers:     Support section—Provides generic support information.          Support contact—Provides special contact information for  support plans. Support forums Home maintenance guides—Contains information on user  serviceable items.  [ 87 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff  Once we have this set up, we should have a new section in our menu that looks   like this:  Hierarchical Page Structures This hierarchical page structure within the menu is created by setting  each page's  apart from the Support page  Parent item as the Support  page, under the Menu settings.  The permissions for this should be set only to be shown to support plan customers.  With our customer roles set up correctly we should now have the following roles  created and set up with correct taxonomy and feature permissions.  Role Assignments Now that we have:         Created customer roles Set up appropriate permissions on these roles Set up pages and content for these specific roles  We need to set up our products to update our customers' role depending on their  purchase, i.e. support plans will enable support customer roles, whereas all other  products enable the customers role.  [ 88 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   EC Role is a part of a module that comes included with the e-commerce package but  is disabled by default.  Chapter 5  Once this module has been installed we have a new group of settings in the product  listing called Role assignments, which have provisions for:            Assigning roles when the customer makes a purchase Removing roles when the customer makes a purchase Removing roles when the product expires  this requires the product to be a  recurring purchase  Assigning roles when the product expires  This could allow us to fully restore a customer's role to what it initially was once the  product expires.  [ 89 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff  For the non-support plan products we only want to assign the customer role;  however, for the support plan products we want to add both the customer role and  the support customers role, and also set it to remove the support customer role once  the product expires.  Reminder: Forcing Customers to be Users If you remember from Chapter 4—Creating Your Product Catalog, one of the options  for the product listings is the Anonymous purchasing policy. This policy defines  who can purchase the product.  There are three options for the policy:           Registered only—Before this product can be checked out all customers must  either register or log in. Flexible—Customers can choose to register or log in, but they can also check  out anonymously. Anonymous only—This won't give customers the option of registering  during the checkout process, but they will be given the option of logging in  or making the purchase anonymously.  If we wanted to ensure all our customers are registered users, we would set this to be  Registered only to disable anonymous purchases. This option can also be set globally, as opposed to for each individual product; it can   be found under the Store section of E-Commerce configuration within the  Administer area.  [ 90 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 5  Customer Management There are no built-in customer management features as such; however, we can  manage our user accounts. There are some customer management features we can  enable including the E-CiviCRM module and the Address module; the first allows  integration with CiviCRM a third-party customer relationship manager, which we  will look at in more detail in Chapter 11—Invoices and CRM. The Address module  enables an address book for users, which we can use to take shipping and billing  addresses when the user checks out. We will also discuss the Address module later, in Chapters 8 and 9—Creating a Better  Selling Experience and Taxes, Payment, and Shipping. The Users section of User management does have some features that are useful  when related to customer management. Firstly, we can filter our list of users by role,  so we could see only customers, or support customers.  The user list shows us some basic information on the users, including:            Their Username Their Status, which indicates if they are blocked or unblocked Roles assigned to them  currently all customers, and any support customers  would be listed, as we set to make all customers part of the customer role,  with the support customers being an additional role for some of them  The length of time they have been a Member for and the time they last  logged in  i.e. their Last access time   [ 91 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff  The edit link allows us to edit all of the user's settings. The check box is linked to a  drop-down box of user Update options that we can perform, including adding or  removing roles, blocking, unblocking, and deleting the selected accounts.  With regards to customers, we can use this to update users to customer status if an  existing customer creates a user account and wishes to have customer access to the  website. Obviously this can be done automatically with the e-Commerce Roles module, but  here we have used it to assign the role to a user who just registered for the site, but  was already a customer before that, so their user account now reflects their status as  a customer.  User Order History We can search transactions for a number of different criteria, including username.  The Search option is in the Administer section under E-Commerce.  In the Search page, we need to select the Advanced search option and enter the  username we want to search for. I'm going to try searching for Michael.  The list of transactions related to that user is then displayed:  [ 92 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 5  The information contained in the table is explained by the headings in the table;  however, the meaning of workflow requires a little explanation. The workflow is how far through the order process the transaction is; if we click the  workflow we then have options to perform some other operations including printing  invoices and canceling the transactions.  Contacting a User When we click on a username in our site, in places such as the user management  areas, we see the user’s profile, and have options for editing the contact and  contacting them.  The Contact section brings up a Contact form as we have installed the Contact form  module in an earlier chapter. Here we enter a subject, a message, and can opt to have  a copy of the email sent to ourselves.  Staff If you remember, at the start of the chapter, Doug wanted his staff members to be  able to use the website, and help him out with things like adding and managing  products and helping with some other tasks such as processing orders. Now that we  have looked into users, roles, and permissions and we have created our customers, it  is time to look into creating user accounts for our staff members.  [ 93 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff  Planning Doug has the following members of staff in his team that he wants to help manage  and administer the website:         Himself Stock assistant Store checkout manager  Doug has the first account, which is an administrator and requires no further  configuration. The stock assistant needs to be able to add new products, and edit and  manage existing products on the website. His store checkout manager needs to be  able to manage users and transactions.  Creating Roles In order to accommodate these needs we need to create two roles; one for the stock  assistant, and one for the checkout manager. Roles are created on the Roles page,  http:  localhost drupal-5.7 admin user roles.  Stock Assistant We start by creating the role with the name Stock Assistant:  Once it is created, we then click the edit permissions link next to the newly created  role and select which modules the user can access; this should include:         Apparel Products Tangible goods  The apparel module should be selected so that the user can create items of clothing  to sell on the store.  [ 94 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   We also want the user to be able to edit, delete, and manage existing products so we  will also select the administer products module.  Chapter 5  Finally, the tangible module allows the user to create and edit shippable products.  Now we have our role for the Stock Assistant ready..  Checkout Manager Permissions are not as detailed for the checkout manager because they are not  available for the individual processes of managing transactions, so we can only  enable the administer store permission. This is done via the edit permissions link  next to the newly created role.  Now, we have our role for the Checkout manager ready.  [ 95 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Customers and Staff  Creating the users Now we create the users, and assign the appropriate roles to the user account from  the list of roles. Don't forget the authenticated user role is automatically combined  with any roles we add. To add new users we can simply click the Add user tab at the  top of the users management page.  We now have our staff members ready to help Doug manage the store reducing his  workload, which he is very pleased about!  Summary In this chapter, we have learned:           How to create and manage user accounts What roles are and how they work with user accounts How to restrict access to specific areas of our site based on roles How to use users and roles when creating and managing customers and   staff members  In the next chapter we will look into branding our site, before moving on to making  money with our store!  [ 96 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Branding Your Site  Doug is really happy with how his website and store are coming along; his product  catalog is online and he has set up customer and staff users on the site; his only  complaint so far is how the website looks. He likes the default design, but does not  think it is appropriate for his site or his store; he wants something more tailored to  his business. In this chapter, we will learn:             What themes are and which ones are the default Drupal themes How to install themes How to manage themes How to customize the default theme How to create themes  Ideally, Doug wants a custom design for his site, but there is no harm in having a  look at some of the other ones available in case they are more suitable for him.  Themes Within Drupal a theme is a collection of images, templates, and style sheets that can  make up the design of our Drupal installation. Different themes provide a different  type of look and feel to the site. A number of different themes come   pre-installed with Drupal, so let's look at those.  Before we can look at the different themes, we need to enable them so that we can  change our theme in our user settings. To enable these themes we need to go to the  Themes section of Drupal's Administer area.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Branding Your Site  All the themes are listed within this area; to enable them we just need to tick the box  in the Enabled column and then click the Save configuration button.  Now that we have enabled these themes we can swap between them from the Edit  section of My Account; this page contains a section entitled Theme Configuration  from where we can select the theme we would like to use. Let's now go through  these themes in turn and see what they are like.  Minnelli This theme is very similar to the default theme with the exception that it has a fixed  width and will not expand depending on the screen size.  [ 98 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Marvin Unlike Minnelli, the Marvin theme is not particularly refreshing; however, it has a  more corporate feel to it using less vibrant colors and a simpler design.  Chapter 6  In particular this could be useful in a business site; however, additional modification  to the skin would make it look much better.  Bluemarine Again, this theme is less vibrant than Minnelli and the default theme, Garland;  however, it is more corporate than them, although less so than the Marvin theme.  [ 99 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Branding Your Site  The style is also less smooth and more block-based with a very rigid header   and menu.  Pushbutton With the Pushbutton theme, we are given quite a different look. In particular, the  typography has been designed with the visually impaired in mind with larger text  size and more spacing between text.  The design is also a little less block-based than some of the other themes and tries to  maintain a more professional approach.  Garland Garland is the default theme, and its only difference with the Minnelli theme is that  it is a fluid-width theme, so if we are viewing the site on a computer with a smaller  or larger screen than Minnelli's default width, the design will shrink or expand to  accommodate the screen size.  [ 100 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 6  This theme reflects the style many websites are now using, including the gradient  color schemes in the menu and the header, a glass style logo, and a nice refreshing  color scheme.  Chameleon A more simplistic approach is taken with this theme, with the entire background  being white with a small bar at the top of the page to add something extra to the page.  [ 101 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Branding Your Site  This design would probably work better on older computers with poor color  schemes or even mobile devices.  Customizing the Default Theme Each of these themes that we have just looked at can be customized beyond its  default look. Let's look at the default theme  garland  and customize it. We can customize the following features:            Color scheme, either based on a color set, or by changing the   individual colors If certain elements, such as the logo, are displayed The logo The favicon  Back in the Themes section of the Administer area, there is a configure link next to  each theme; if we click this we are taken to the theme's configuration page.  Although Doug ideally wants a new theme that is unique to his website, he also  wants to have a look at a few different options for the default theme. In particular,  he wants to add his company's logo to the website and try a number of red color  schemes as those are his corporate colors.  Color Scheme The color scheme settings are quite intuitive and easy to change. We can either:        set Select a color set  color set Change each color by entering the hexadecimal colour codes  the �� followed  color by entering the hexadecimal colour codes  the �� followed  by entering the hexadecimal colour codes  the �� followed  by 6 characters   [ 102 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065      Select the colors from the color wheel  Chapter 6  To change a color using the color wheel, we need to click on the color type  base  color, link color, etc.  to select it and then chose the general color from the wheel and  the shade of the color from the square within.  When we change the colors or color set, the preview window below the settings  automatically updates to reflect the color change.  The following color sets are available:                                   Blue Lagoon  the default set  Ash Aquamarine Belgian Chocolate Bluemarine Citrus Blast Cold Day Greenbeam Meditarrano Mercury Nocturnal Olivia Pink Plastic Shiny Tomato Teal Top Custom  [ 103 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Quite a number of these are red-based color schemes, let's look into them, they are:   Branding Your Site         Belgian Chocolate Meditarrano Shiny Tomato  Belgian Chocolate Color Set The Belgian Chocolate color set uses a dark red header with a gradient starting with  black flowing into a dark red color. The page's background is a cream color and the  main content area has a white background as illustrated by the picture below:  Mediterrano Color Set  Color Set  Set The Mediterrano color set uses a lighter red color where the gradient in the header  starts with a light orange color which then flows into a light red color. Similar to  the Belgian Chocolate color scheme the background is cream in color with a white  background for the content area.  [ 104 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Shiny Tomato Color Set The Shiny Tomato color set has a gradient header that starts with deep red and flows  into a bright red color. The page's background is light grey with white background  for the main content area, reflecting a professional image.  Chapter 6  The Shiny Tomato color set uses a red scheme which is in Doug's logo and he feels  this set is the most professional of the three and wants us to use that.  Toggle Display With the toggle display options, we can select the elements we wish to display on  our site, these include:                   Logo Site name Site slogan Mission statement User pictures in posts User pictures in comments Search box Shortcut icon  By default Site Slogan, User pictures in posts, User pictures in comments, and  Search box are disabled, the rest are already enabled. Unfortunately with this theme  we can only enable the Site Slogan; the other three options cannot be enabled with  our choice of theme.  [ 105 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Branding Your Site  Doug initially wanted the slogan to be enabled; however, because of the length of his  slogan, users with a small screen would not see the website name or the slogan:  The slogan and site name will only be displayed if we have a larger screen as  illustrated below:  Because of this problem, Doug decided it was not worth leaving the option enabled!  Logo Image Settings As Doug also wants his logo to go into the website, we need to uncheck the option  for using the default logo and select the logo file to upload.  [ 106 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Once the logo has been uploaded, the website's header immediately updates to  include the logo we have just uploaded, as shown below:  Chapter 6  Shortcut Icon Settings The final option for customizing the sites theme is the Shortcut icon settings. The  shortcut icon is the favicon displayed in the address bar of our browser next to the  web address. By default, this is a small version of the Drupal logo.  Let's customize this to a small version of Doug's logo. Graphics editing programs  have little provisions for creating icon files, so let's use a web-based tool to turn the  logo into a favicon. We can use http:  www.htmlkit.com services favicon ,  which is a popular online favicon generator.  On this website we can upload our logo:  Once the image has been uploaded, a preview of the icon is displayed on the site and  we can download a copy of it.  [ 107 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Branding Your Site  Now that we have our favicon generated and downloaded, we can upload it to   our website:  Once this is uploaded our favicon updates automatically, as shown below:  The Customized Skin These changes leave us with a skin that looks like this:  [ 108 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Doug is really pleased with these changes, and thinks it is a massive improvement  on the default theme; however, he still wants to have a look at having a new theme  created for his site. The customized site really impressed him though, so he may stick  with it.  Chapter 6  Installing and Managing Themes In addition to the themes that come with Drupal we can also download new themes  and install them in our site. Let's take a look at some of these themes that we can  download and install. We will also look into managing these themes and deleting  unnecessary themes.  Installing Themes We can download themes from the themes section on the Drupal website,   http:  drupal.org project Themes.  After a brief look through the directory of themes, Doug found one that he quite  liked and wanted to try out. The theme that he likes is Barron, so let's download it  for him and install it to see what it is like.  The version we want to download is the 5.x-1.4 version since we are using one of the  5.x versions of Drupal.  [ 109 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Branding Your Site  To install the theme, we need to uncompress the file we have just downloaded and  then upload it to the themes directory on our website. Once it is installed, we just  need to enable it and then select it as the theme we want to use:  This theme does not promote the image Doug was hoping for in a site, so he has  decided not to use it.  Managing Themes Back into the main theme page we have a number of management options.  From here we can:         Enable a theme Set a theme as the site's default theme View configuration options  [ 110 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   To actually delete a theme, we just need to delete its folder from the themes directory  in our website.  Chapter 6  Creating a Theme A comprehensive guide to themes and theme development can be found on the  Drupal website at http:  drupal.org node 509. Themes generally consist of   three layers:         A PHP template engine An xHTML template Styles in the form of CSS  It is recommended to start creating our theme from an existing Drupal theme; the  themes that are recommended to use are Zen or Bluebreeze. The theme that we  are going to create is only a simple one-page theme, which will use default styling  provided by each module.  Drupal 5 Themes by Ric Shreves, ISBN 978-1-84719-182-3 published by  Packt Publishing, it is a book published specifically for creating themes  with Drupal 5; you may wish to try this book if you wish to create more  detailed, and complex themes.  See http:  www.packtpub.com  drupal-5-themes book.   Personally, I find it easier to create a webpage template as a working HTML file and  then move this across to the theme's template files. Below is the template we have for  Doug's Dinos, which we need to turn into a theme:  [ 111 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Branding Your Site  Template Files These are the default template files with a theme:             Page theme  page.tpl.php  Block within a sidebar  block.tpl.php  Generic container for the main area of the site  box.tpl.php  Comment theme  comment.tpl.php  Node theme  node.tpl.php   These files can then be edited with our favorite text editor and we can import our  design into the template files.  We now need to examine each of these files and transfer our HTML template to  these, and replace the CSS file with the one from our template.  If we start with the page.tpl.php file we can get a basic design up and running to  see what it is like, then we can concern ourselves with sections such as comments  and nodes. The key to doing this is keeping the sections of the template code which  are encapsulated within   tags in the new template but ensuring they are  placed correctly within the file.  The code for Doug's page.tpl.php file is:      <meta name="description" content="Doug's dinos aim to             <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text html; <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text html;    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"     "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">                                                     charset=iso-8859-1"  >            provide education resources on Dinosaurs as well as            selling models and   toys relating to the Jurassic era."  >                                            Associates Dougs Dinos"  >       media="screen">@import "http:  www.dougsdinos.com drupal-               5.7 themes darkjuniper juniperstyle.css";       >         <meta name="copyright" content="  Peacock, Carter and      <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image x-icon"    <style type="text css" title="Default page style"          [ 112 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 6      5.7 themes      'links        'links secondary-links'  ; ?>    <img src="http:  www.dougsdinos.com drupal-      Doug's Dinos   '. $mission .'

To go from template HTML file to this stage, which is  a little rough round the edges only takes five minutes!  Summary In this chapter, we looked into branding our site and we:         Explored and customized the default themes Downloaded and installed new themes Created a custom theme  Now that we have a newly branded site with which Doug is really happy, it's  time for us to look at Chapter 7—Checkout and Taking Payments, so we can begin to  monetize our site!  [ 114 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking  Payments  We now have a great looking site for Doug to use. Along with his online product  catalog, it is now time to look into the checkout process and take payments from  customers. In this chapter, we will learn:  How to finalize the store ready for customers How the checkout process works How to customize the checkout process How to process orders  This will allow us to start accepting payments from customers; however, we will  need to do more to improve the process  such as more payment options; for now we  will just set one up quickly so payments work .  Finalizing the Store Ready for Customers Let's add a product to our shopping cart, place it as an order, and see what happens:  Select a product. Click Add to cart. Click the your shopping cart link. Click Checkout. If we are not logged in, we need to enter an email address.  address. Click the Place your order button.  The order is then placed.                        This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking Payments  What's Missing? If you went through that process you might have noticed there were a few things  missing, which prevent us from taking orders and payments:       Our address was not taken. Our payment method and payment details were not taken.  We need to correct these problems so we can start to take payments!  Taking Addresses In order to take addresses from customers during Checkout we need to enable the  Address sub-module from the E-Commerce Customer Interface module, so let's  enable that now:  We are now able to take our customers’ addresses  as we will see in a moment! .  Taking Payments The reason we are not able to take payments is because we don't have a payment  gateway installed. As we are going to look into payments in more detail in   Chapter 9—Taxes, Payment, and Shipping, let's just look into the simplest payment  gateway, which is called Cash on Delivery  COD . This module can be used for  transactions where the customer pays with cash or posts a cheque or pays with  credit-card details over the phone. If we use this for telephone payments, we would  need some form of payment processor where we can manually edit credit card  information, such as PayPal's Virtual Terminal, so we can enter the details while the  customer is on the phone.  Once this is installed we can officially start taking orders and payments! Let's give it  a try!  [ 116 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Let's Try Again Now that we have provisions for shipping and payments, let's take another look at  placing an order.  First, we need to add some products to our shopping cart and then click the  Checkout button.  Chapter 7  Next, we need to enter a new address because we don't have any postal addresses  tied to our account in our "address book", so let's enter a postal address in the  address form, and then click the Create new address button.  [ 117 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking Payments  This saves the address to our address book, which is tied to our account; we can then  select this address as our shipping and or billing address. If we have an alternative  address for either of these we can add it by clicking on the add a new address link  next to the drop-down box of addresses.  The confirmation page then confirms our:             Email address Shipping address Billing address Payment details Order summary  Notice, that the addresses and payment methods were omitted when we first went  through this process. We can also change the address from this screen by clicking the   change  link next to the addresses.  [ 118 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   There is only one payment option enabled in the system at the moment  as we will  be looking at the rest in more detail in Chapter 9—Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  and  this has no further options, so we have to leave that as it is. We can also make any  last minute changes to the order before finalizing the order.  Chapter 7  Once we submit this page we receive a confirmation note to tell us the purchase has  been received.  As we have set up the address and payment options, we also receive an email to  confirm the order, which reminds us of our shipping address, billing address, and  the purchases we made.  Unfortunately the payment options we have enabled are very primitive and  essentially require us to communicate with the customer to handle the payment   and arrange delivery or pickup; however, for now we are able to take orders!  [ 119 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking Payments  How the Checkout Process Works After setting up our store to accept orders with addresses and payment methods,  let's review how this works:  Select products to order Select billing and shipping addresses Confirm the addresses Select a payment method Confirm the order Place the order Receive confirmation email Order is processed by staff  The settings and options for some of these can be changed depending on the  modules to which they are related.  How to Customize the Checkout Process A number of parts of the checkout process can be customized including:  The order of some of the checkout screens Price formatting Payment methods available  looked at in detail in Chapter 8—Creating a  Better Selling Experience  How the payment method works The emails sent to the customer Global anonymous purchase policy Whether or not the site administrator is notified about transactions Overview text for a user's order history How a user adds a product to their shopping cart Continuing shopping after adding a product to the cart  Doug is not sure how he wants to customize the process, so let's take a look at how  these options can be customized and see what he thinks!                                         [ 120 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 7  Checkout Screen Order With the modules we have currently installed, the order of the following pages can  be configured:           Anonymous user page  where the user enters their email address or logs in  User's address Payment method The cart  These settings are under E-Commerce Configuration in the Screen order page. For practical reasons, however, the ec_anon and cart pages are restricted to being  the first and last page respectively. This is because if the user is not logged in we first  need to either get their details or ask them to login, and the cart itself must obviously  be the last page.  Doug is quite happy with the address being selected before payment, so let's leave  those settings as they are and move on.  [ 121 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking Payments  Price Formatting Within E-Commerce configuration is the Payment section, which allows us to alter  the format of prices as well as the currency used.  Although Doug's business is based in the UK, he is hoping to take a large number of  orders for models from the US, and so wants us to leave the formatting unchanged  and the currency as USD.  Payment Methods The payment methods can be customized with the various payment gateway  modules that can be installed; however, we will cover this in more detail in Chapter  8—Creating a Better Selling Experience, so let's leave it for now.  How the Payment Method Works Within the C.O.D. section of the E-Commerce configuration section we have a  number of configuration options for the payment method. There are:           The title—We can see this as the name of the payment method when placing  an order. As this payment method is generic we should consider renaming it  to something like cheque payment or telephone payment. Thank You Page—We should also consider creating a thanks page for the  user after the payment procedure. Marking the order once the payment has been made—In this case we don't,  as the only way for it to be marked as paid is by an administrator..  [ 122 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 7     Marking the transaction workflow as completed—In the administration area,  each order goes through a workflow of options including:                Received Invoiced Shipped Awaiting customer response Cancelled Completed Security violation  Doug wants to change the name from COD to something a little more meaningful,  and he also wants the user to go to a special thanks page after completing their order.   Emails Sent to the Customer At various points throughout the order process and the post-order process emails  relating to their order are sent to the customer. Similar to the emails sent to users  when they register, which we looked at in Chapter 5—Customers and Staff, we can  edit and manage these emails. The email settings can be found in E-Commerce  configuration under Mail.  [ 123 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking Payments  The Recurring product reminder emails are not used by our current setup so they  can be deleted; the other emails can be viewed and edited. For now, Doug is quite  happy with the default emails, so we will leave them as they are.  Global Anonymous Purchase Policy We looked into anonymous purchase policies in Chapter 4—Creating Your Product  Catalog when we implemented our product catalog. In addition to the per product  settings, we can also set this globally to one of:         Registered only—Customers must log in or register to check out Flexible—Customers can register or log in or check out anonymously Anonymous only—Customers can log in or purchase anonymously but the  option to register is never given.  Doug likes the flexibility that comes with having a flexible purchase policy, as we  discussed in Chapter 4—Creating Your Product Catalog, so let's leave it as it is.  Administrator Notifications When orders are placed we can opt for the administrator to be emailed a summary  of the order, this is particularly useful when manually processing orders, and these  orders are infrequent so you may not need to visit the website on a daily basis. This setting is found in E-Commerce configuration under Store.  [ 124 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Doug wants this feature enabled so he does not need to keep checking the system for  new orders, so let's enable it for him.  Chapter 7  This setting depends on having set up a cron job to periodically call the  cron.php file; this allows emails to be sent in groups periodically. For  more information on setting up cron jobs, you should contact your web  host. Typically it involves a crontab setting in your hosting control panel  such as cPanel.  Order History Overview Text Also in the Store area of E-Commerce configuration is the order history overview  text; although it is not technically part of the checkout process, it relates to customer  service and previous orders.  Doug wants to use this area to thank customers for their previous orders, and make  them feel welcome to contact him whenever they need to, regarding anything about  their purchases with his store.  This makes the order history page look quite friendly, as illustrated below:  How Products are Added to the Cart There are two options for users adding products to the shopping cart:       Users can click a link, which adds the product to their cart. Users can enter the quantity of the product and then click the add to   cart button.  [ 125 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking Payments  These settings can also be found in the Store section of E-Commerce configuration.  This form is quite useful as it encourages the user to order more than one of the  product, whereas with the link a user must physically add the product to the cart  multiple times, which can be inconvenient. Doug likes the idea of the form, so let's  uncheck the box and save the settings.  We now have a small form at the bottom of each product page:  Continuing Shopping after Adding a Product  to the Cart When products are added to the cart we can either:       Take the user back to the product listing Take the user to their shopping cart  This setting is from the Store within E-Commerce configuration.  This setting and the setting we looked at just before work well when they are  oppositely set, so if the first box is unchecked this one works best if it is checked,  something which Doug agrees with, so let's check this box and save our settings!  [ 126 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 7  Processing Orders So far in this chapter we have looked at how to set up our site to take orders, how to  place orders, and how to customize the checkout process. Now let's have a look at  actually processing the orders placed through the website.  Order Overview In the Administer area, if we select the E-Commerce section from the menu, the  page we are presented with contains an overview of order statistics including some  monthly figures. The Orders overview groups all of the orders in the system by their current   payment status.  Each of the payment statuses in the overview is linked to a filtered listing of orders  that have that specific status of payment.  Also on this overview page we have some monthly figures, which indicate how many  orders we have had this month as well as how much we have taken in this month.  Since Doug's site have not yet taken any payments  we don't have payments  properly set up yet  the monthly figures are currently zero.  Transaction List From the E-Commerce menu, the Transactions page lists all of the transactions  stored within the system.  [ 127 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking Payments  We can filter the list by each of the different fields for the order, as well as create new  transactions. For each transaction the following information is displayed:  Order ID number Customer name  and username  Payment status Workflow position Gross amount Date created Date changed Date due  for recurring payments  Number of items ordered Operations                              The operations are:  Edit Addresses Items  We will look more into payment statuses and workflow information shortly, so let's  take a look at the operations available.  Edit The edit page allows us to change the workflow and payment status of the order, the  username and email address of customer, and the payment method. We can neither  alter the gross amount nor the last modified date.  [ 128 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 7  The ability to change these details is quite useful. For instance, if a user can no longer  pay using a specific method we can change it for them, or if someone placed the  order for someone else but cannot make the payment, we can transfer the order to  another account to pay for it.  Addresses Clicking the addresses link displays the billing and shipping addresses for the order;  in addition to seeing these addresses we can also change them, which is useful if a  customer contacts us to request a change of delivery address.  Items The items link shows the items which are related to the order, and allows us to edit  the individual items tied to the order.  Workflow The workflow process indicates how the order goes through the system, and the  workflow statuses available are:       Order received Customer invoiced  [ 129 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Checkout and Taking Payments             Order shipped Awaiting customer response Cancelled Completed Security violation  If we click on the workflow status of a particular transaction, we are presented with a  number of operations including:  If we notify the customer that the order has been shipped  we can't do this yet, as we  have not configured shipping options!  the workflow changes to shipped, if we need  to send the customer an email  such as: We noticed you ordered a care package  for your model dinosaur, but you have not purchased a model, do you want to  continue with your order?  the status changes to awaiting customer response. Once  payment is received by the payment gateway the status changes to Completed, and  if we cancel the order it is marked as Cancelled.  Payment Statuses A payment can have any of the following statuses:                 Pending Payment received Completed Failed Denied Refunded Cancelled  Currently, because of our payment gateway we have to manually edit the transaction  to change the payment status; however, we will look into this in more detail when  we look into the Payment API in detail!  [ 130 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 7  Current Limitations with Our Store Although we looked into taking orders and payments, we have the   following limitations:  Workflow is limited due to shipping and payment issues Payment status does not update The whole process is very manual  When we look into Chapter 9—Taxes, Shipping, and Payments, we will correct these  issues and make massive improvements on our current store.                  Summary In this chapter, we have learned:  How the order process works How to customize this order process How to place an order How to manage and process orders  Although we did not look into payment options in great detail, and are quite limited  in that respect at the moment, we can at least use our store to receive orders and  manually accept payments and update the orders accordingly. Now let's move on  to creating a better selling experience before moving on to mentioned the topics  covered in this chapter in greater detail.  [ 131 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating a Better Selling  Experience  We have our newly branded site, and we can take a basic form of payment! In this  chapter, let's look at creating a better selling experience for our customers.  In this chapter, you will learn:  How to add a shopping cart How to add search features How to auto-create user accounts How to include images on our product listings How to provide discounts to customers based on their role How to enable coupons so customers can get discounts How to provide discounts on bulk purchases More about some of the other e-Commerce options and product types  Making Things Easier Although Doug's store is relatively simple for his customers to use, it is missing three  key features that would make their time on the website easier, these are:  An overview of the shopping cart Search features Ability to auto-create user accounts  At the moment, without a search feature the only way for users to find products is by  manually browsing through the website and stumbling across a product they like.                          This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating a Better Selling Experience  Adding a Shopping Cart We can add a shopping cart to our theme so that customers can continue browsing  the website but still know how much is in their shopping cart, and easily get to   it later. To add this block, we need to go to the Blocks section, which is under Site Building  within the Administer area. Within the Blocks section, we need to ensure we have  all our themes selected  or do this for each theme we are using  and then change the  Region of the Shopping cart to the left sidebar.  Once we click on the Save blocks button, the shopping cart block is displayed in   our theme:  Adding Search Capabilities Doug tested the website with a few friends and family members, and their main  issue with it was the difficulty in finding products they wanted. The first thing we need to do is install the Search module, which is grouped under  the Core - optional section of Modules in the Administer area.  With the module installed, we now need to enable the Search feature from the  Blocks section; otherwise the search box won't be displayed on the website. We can  select this feature by going to Administer  Site Building  Blocks, then set it up in  the same way as for the shopping cart and save the settings.  [ 134 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   We now have a search box on our website under the header but above the   main menu!  Chapter 8  Let's try searching for one of our products, for instance T-Rex. Notice something?  No results found! This seems quite strange as we have a product with T-Rex in the  name, so why didn't we get any results?  The reason for this is that Drupal has not yet been indexed. Drupal uses a cron job to  create the index of the site. Without the indexing done Search options cannot work.  The Search settings under Administer  Site configuration allow us to specify how  many pages are indexed per "cron run" and allow us to set the site to be re-indexed.  Cron Jobs A cron job is a setting on your web host's server  if you have cPanel  hosting, it is available under "crontab"  that performs tasks at specific  times. Drupal has a special page that performs various tasks; this can be  called by a cron job so that it regularly opens the page and runs the tasks.  [ 135 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating a Better Selling Experience  This setting depends on having set up a cron job to periodically call the cron.php file. For more information on setting up cron jobs, you should  contact your web host. Typically it involves a crontab setting in your  hosting control panel such as cPanel.   We can manually run the cron task, by opening the cron.php file in our web  browser. In this case we just open: http:  www.dougsdinos.com cron.php.  Once we have opened this page, let's try searching for T-Rex again. This time we will  get some results!  Customers will now be able to find products and other content on Doug's website  much more easily!  Auto-Creating User Accounts If a customer is not a user on our site, we can automatically create a user account  for them once they have placed their order; this saves the inconvenience of using an  anonymous purchase policy where the user has to log in or register, but it gives the  user the added convenience of having their details saved for future orders.  This is something Doug wants to enable to make things easier for regular customers  on this site. The first thing we need to do is install the module. The module is called  EC Useracc and is listed in the E-Commerce Uncategorized group of modules.  [ 136 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Now under E-Commerce configuration we have a new option called User Account;  let's take a look at it. This has the following settings:  Chapter 8         Confirmation e-mail Welcome mail Days to confirm expiry  The Confirmation e-mail is to see if the customer wants to create a user account; this  email expires after the number of days set in the Days to confirmation expiry setting  has passed, and the Welcome mail is the email sent when the account is created.  These emails can be configured on the Mail page. These settings don't actually enable the feature though; we have installed the module  and looked at the global settings, but to actually get it to work we need to set how  we would like each product to work in relation to this module. If we go to edit any  product, there is a new section, which was not there previously, called User account  provision; this is what we need to change.  As Doug wants this feature enabled, we need to check the option Create an account  for the user when this product is purchased. The other option, Block the user's  account when this product expires, relates to using recurring billing in products   mainly non-tangible products i.e. services  such as a customer support contract or a  magazine subscription.  Adding Images to Products Doug is not happy with the products on his website as they don't have any pictures  next to them, so he wants to upload some for his customers to know what they   are buying.  There are quite a number of different methods for adding images and other related  files to products and content types. First, let's have a look at the methods available:     A built-in upload module      Listed as an attachment Embedded into the description  [ 137 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating a Better Selling Experience     A third-party image module      Embedded into the description As a product  Both these modules have their own merits and uses; the upload module can be used  to upload files that are attached to a content element such as a product or a page.  Attachments can be directly linked to or listed with the content.  CCK Module Drupal's Content Construction Kit module along with Imagefield and  Imagecache modules can provide a richer product view and improve a  product's feature. If you are feeling adventurous you may wish to give  them a try after looking at the options in this book!  A third-party image module can be used for uploading an image as a file in its own  right; we can then embed this image into content  primitively using links and HTML  tags  or we can edit the image to become a new content element, such as a page or  a product and then turn it into the product we want. If we use this method then the  image is automatically displayed in the product listing.  Built-in Upload Module To enable this we need to install the Upload module, and then we can edit the  product and upload the images.  This module is not just for use in the e-Commerce section; we can use it for pages  and other types of content to add images to the site.  Let's edit a product and also add a picture of that product. In the edit screen, we have  a new section called File attachments; this is what we use to upload the pictures to  the product. To try it out I'm just going to use the company’s logo as the picture.  [ 138 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   List as Attachment To list the image as an attachment on the product page we need to leave the list box  checked  as shown in the previous image  and then save the product. Now when we  view the product we have a list of attachments at the bottom of the page.  Chapter 8  This is particularly useful for attaching files such as PDF fact sheets about the  product in question.  Embed Image into Description For images, having a list of attachments isn't very good, so let's embed the image into  the product description using HTML. If we go back to Edit the product, and scroll down to the attachments, the URL of  the image is shown; we need to make a note of this: http:  www.dougsdinos.com  drupal-5.7 files garland_logo_0.png. To use this image, we would add the following HTML in the Description section:  <img src='http:  www.dougsdinos.com drupal-           5.7 files garland_logo_0.png'     style='float:left; padding: 5px;' alt='PRODUCT NAME'  >  This adds the image, and allows text to wrap around it  but leaving some space  so it  looks nice on the page, the end result is shown below:  Don't forget to select the correct input format! Otherwise Drupal will  remove our HTML code when we create the product!

Once we have downloaded the Image module package, decompressed the files, and  uploaded it to our installation we need to enable the related modules within the  package, including:       Image Image Attach  We don't need the other sub-modules at this time, so let's enable these two for now.  Now that we have it installed, let's have a look at the module and how it works. Within Site configuration there are two new sections, Image and Image attach. We  are only concerned with the Image section. It has the following settings:         The default path where the images are stored The maximum file size of images uploaded The sizes of the image, preview image, and thumbnail  For now, we shall leave these values as they are and upload an image.  Embed Image into Description To upload the image, we need to go into Create content and select Image.  The Submit Image page asks for the following information:     Title  required   [ 140 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 8       Image  required  Description or body  We can also change settings for things like comments, menus, and author  information and set the image to be a product  we will try that next . Once we have  uploaded an image and entered the name of the image we are taken to the page  containing the image. From here we can swap between Original view, Preview,  and Thumbnail. The best way to embed an uploaded image is to right-click on the thumbnail   picture and copy the URL of the web address, and then do the same for the preview  image. We can then add the HTML for the image and link it to the larger version of  the image.  For the image I have just uploaded, the thumbnail link is: http:  www.dougsdinos. com drupal-5.7 files images 1847191118.thumbnail.jpg and the preview link  is: http:  www.dougsdinos.com drupal-5.7 files images 1847191118.jpg.  We can now create the HTML link for this and add it to the product page.  <a href='http:  www.dougsdinos.com drupal-           5.7 files images 1847191118.jpg'>    <img src='http:  www.dougsdinos.com drupal-           5.7 files images 1847191118.thumbnail.jpg'          alt='PRODUCT NAME'  >    As a Product The embedded option is not very practical because it involves looking up the  image locations and creating the HTML code for the product. If we are creating a  new product, we could create the image first, and then turn the image content into  a product. To do this, we go through the process of creating the image as we did  before, but we expand the product options and select a product type for the image.  [ 141 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating a Better Selling Experience  We select the product type, click Add to store, and then we can continue editing the  product, using the Title and Body fields for the product name and description. This method creates a neater product entry with the image already there for us,  which is much neater and cleaner than the other methods.  CCK The CCK module and other image modules mentioned earlier also  provide the same effect; you can try them out!  Discounts Many online stores offer discounts to customers by one means or another; we can use  the following methods to offer our customers discounts when shopping at the store:         Discounts based on the customer's role Coupons or gift certificates Discounts when customers purchase a certain number of items  The first two are built-in options, which just need to be enabled; the final option  requires us to install a new module into our store.  Role-Based Let's first enable the module in the same way we have enabled all of the other  modules; the module is called Role Discount.  [ 142 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 8  Once it is enabled there is now a new option under E-Commerce configuration,  called Role discount. This page lists a text box alongside each of the roles in our  store, for us to enter the discount for each respective role. Doug wants to offer a  number of different discounts to his customers:        Doug wants to offer a discount of $2.99 for customers who are new users to  his site but have already registered. He wants to offer a discount of $15.99 to customers, who have already made  a purchase, and thus are in the customers' role.  If we now go to the products page as a user who has been assigned the customers  role, the price has automatically changed to reflect the discount. It does not inform us  of the change, and as far as the user is concerned the cost has never changed unless  they can recall it from before they logged in.  [ 143 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating a Better Selling Experience  Coupons With coupons, customers can purchase a gift certificate which entitles them to money  off a future purchase.  To use the feature, we of course have to install the module; it is already built into   the e-Commerce module, so we just need to check the box to enable it in the  Modules page.  Once it is installed we have a new product type, which is Gift Certificate. Let's create  one and see how it works.  The options available are the same as with the other products; we can enter a name,  a description, a price, as well as other options relating to the other modules we have  installed such as the Role assignments or the User account provision. The difference  with how this module works is that if we set the price to $0.00, then the customer can  choose the amount for the voucher.  Doug wants customers to be able to choose their own value of gift certificate so let's  create a gift certificate with no value and then see it in action. We see the name and  description and we see the Amount is a changeable textbox, where we can enter the  amount we wish.  [ 144 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Bulk Purchases The Quantity Discount module is a third-party add on, which can be downloaded  from http:  drupal.org project quantity_discount; let's download and install  the module before setting it up.  Chapter 8  Once it is installed we have a new option under E-Commerce configuration called  Quantity discount, within this we can define up to 15 discount rules, each containing  up to six conditions for discount. For each discount rule we can set:       A name for the discount Up to six conditions, each consisting of:          Minimum order quantity. Operator  either percentage or fixed price reduction —This  defines how the adjustment should be applied. Adjustment—This is the value of either the percentage or  fixed discount.  Since Doug has already introduced a number of other offers and discount initiatives,  he does not want to use a quantity discount on his store; however, it is worth  keeping this option in case he changes his mind.  [ 145 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating a Better Selling Experience  When we create or edit a product we have the option to select a discount rule if any  applies to the product.  Other e-Commerce Options and Product  Types There are some other e-Commerce options that we can use to provide a better selling  experience to our customers, as well as some different product types. Let's have a  look at those now:         Auction products Donate products Flexicharge  These three modules are included with the e-Commerce Modules and just need to be  installed in the usual way.  Auction If we want to, we can create products that act as auctions. There is only one setting  related to auctions within the E-Commerce configuration, and that is the Default  Auction Length. This setting is the number of days in the future that the expiry date  will default too. Let's just try it with one day to see how the auction products work.  We also have the new product type when creating a new product; let's create a   new auction.  [ 146 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   The only difference in the product's fields from the other product types is that there  is the expiration date; the default date is one day ahead of the current day, as we  observed in the default auction length setting. We can of course change this date as  per our wish.  Chapter 8  When setting the price on the auction product, we enter the minimum amount we  would like for the product, as it acts as the initial starting bid.  When viewing the product we have just created, we can see where the current bidder  is, who the high bidder is, and view the bidding history as illustrated below:  If we click the Place Bid button we are prompted to enter our bid  which is above the  current high bid  and then to Confirm bid.  Donate The Donation product acts like the other basic products except it is for neither a  product nor a service and is classed as a financial contribution.  There are other third-party modules available that offer more features such as  donation tracking.  [ 147 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Creating a Better Selling Experience  Flexicharge The flexicharge module allows us to create custom charges or discounts for particular  conditions on an order. The charges are configured from the Flexicharge section of  E-Commerce configuration. This page lists the Currently configured charges and  the option to Add a new charge.  There are two types of flexicharge that we can create:       Site-wide charge Simple shipping charge  We will look into simple shipping charges in detail in Chapter 9—Taxes, Payments,  and Shipping. So, what does the Site-wide charge allow us to do and when is  it useful? It allows custom charges to be added to orders, and can be useful in  situations such as adding a payment processing charge or adding charges because a  user is in a particular role.  When creating a site-wide charge we can set the following settings:                                Display label—This is the name or label for the charge. Operator:  Fixed amount added or subtracted from the cost A percentage of the subtotal A percentage of the total items  Charge rate—This is the amount or percentage of the charge. Calculation order—This is the order in which this calculation is performed. It  is useful when we have multiple charges applied to the same order. Options to:  Display a subtotal before the charge Display a subtotal after the charge Display the amount as included in the cost but not added to  the subtotal Ignore it if the charge is zero  [ 148 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 8       Product types—This charge applies to all the listed products. Roles—This applies to all the user roles that have the charge applied to   their orders.  An example for these charges would be to add PayPal fees to an order; one charge  would add the fixed charge to an order, and the other charge would add the  percentage charge  since PayPal adds a fixed charge then adds a percentage charge   to an order.  In some countries adding PayPal charges violates their agreement. In  the UK it is only permissible to add the charge to UK customers as long  as you are telling them you are doing so. In the US and Canada this is a  violation of their agreement—so don't use it in those countries!  Summary In this chapter, we looked into improving our customers' experience by creating a  better selling environment for our customers. In particular we:             Added search facilities Set up our store to automatically create user accounts when a guest made   a purchase Looked into the different ways to include images and files in our   product listing Learned how to provide discounts based on:              User's role Coupons Number of purchases made  Auction products Donations     Investigated other product types including:     Looked into flexicharges and their uses.  In the next chapter we will look into Payments, Shipping, and Taxes in greater detail,  making it easier to take payments, and opening our site to more users, as well as  integrating with a number of postal services.

Let's now build upon this ability to take orders by looking into how  Drupal e-Commerce handles taxes, payments, and shipping. Doug is very keen to  look into this so he can take payments automatically and speedup the processing of  online orders.  In this chapter, you will learn:           How to work with taxes in Drupal e-Commerce How the electronic payment system works How to set up electronic payments How to use Drupal e-Commerce's shipping API modules  Taxes Drupal e-Commerce has a very flexible Tax API that can be used to define a number  of different tax rules based on a number of different conditions including:     Location         State or province or region Country City     Product type     Each product type that is available to our store  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  Before we can set up any tax rules, we first need to enable the Tax API module; this  is done within the Modules section under Site Building from the Administer menu.  Under the E-Commerce Uncategorized section we have the Tax API module; let's  check the appropriate check box and click the Save configuration button to install  the module.  With the module installed we now have a new option under the E-Commerce  configuration menu called Taxes. If we go into this section we are taken to a page that lists the created tax rules    we don't have any yet  and also has a link to Add tax. Before we create some tax  rules, let's think about the rules we might require.  Tax Rules Doug's Dinos is a UK-based business so he needs to comply with the UK tax laws;  however, his brother has just moved to the US and set up Doug's Dinos Inc, a small  retail store based in California; this store sells the same products as Doug's own   store in the UK and effectively acts as a US branch. They want to use the same  website to sell products online so they also need to comply with the US tax laws  wherever appropriate.  The tax rules here should be considered as a guide only, if you are unsure  of the tax law in your country or state you should contact a tax advisor.  Tax Rules: UK As Doug's Dinos is a VAT-registered company he must charge Value Added Tax on  his products. All of Doug's products need to have VAT charged at the standard rate  of 17.5%. Drupal also has provisions for donations to be made to the business, so  depending on how these donations are used they may be classified as VAT exempt.  Unfortunately the tax rules within Drupal e-Commerce only allow rules  to be applied onto product types, and not groups of products. This could  be problematic if you offer products under both the standard and reduced  VAT rate; however, it should be easy to accomplish by modifying the Tax  API code. Most features from the Tax module can also be obtained using  the Flexicharge module we briefly looked at in the previous chapter.  [ 152 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 9  Rule: Add 17.5% to all orders excluding donations.  Tax Rules: California, USA Doug's Dinos Inc needs to charge sales tax on all tangible goods but not on services  such as its model repair service.  Rule: Add 7.25% to all tangible goods.  Tax Rules: Orders Placed Elsewhere Tax for orders from other states and countries depend on a number of factors  including the country or state fulfilling the order and the country or state of the  customer. Doug will need to obtain professional tax advice to determine how to deal  with these situations.  Creating the Tax Rules If we click the Add tax link in the Taxes section we are prompted to select a Type of  Location to define the new tax rule for. Let's start with the UK tax rule, and select  Country from the drop-down list:  Then we need to click the Next button. We are now taken to a page with the final  configuration options including:         Country  a drop-down list of countries  Adjustment  the adjustment to be performed to the item's cost  Product type  the type of products to which the adjustment should apply   [ 153 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  Let's select United Kingdom for the country, enter 17.5% as the adjustment, and then  select all the product types except for Donation:  Next we need to click the Submit button; this then creates the tax rule and lists it on  the Taxes page we were on earlier. Now let's create the rule for Doug's Dinos Inc. by  clicking the Add tax link again, and this time selecting State   Province   Region as  the Type of Location to define the new tax rule for.  [ 154 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Once we have clicked the Next button we are again taken to the page with the tax  options on it. The only difference to this from the previous tax rules we created is  that we don't have a drop-down list for the states; we instead have a text box. This is  quite a handy text box as it uses a collection of web technologies called AJAX to look  up states that start with the text we type into the box. If we type C into the box, it will  list all states beginning with C allowing us to easily find the one we want:   Chapter 9  Once we select the state we want from the list, it then populates the text box with the  abbreviated version of the state's name, in this case CA. Next we need to enter 7.25% as the Adjustment and then select the Product types we  wish to apply the rule to and then click the Submit button. The Taxes page lists these rules that we have created along with the options to delete  or edit the rule.  Further Options The list of countries, regions, and states used by Drupal e-Commerce can be  modified from the Regions section of the E-Commerce configuration menu. Within  here we could create a group of states or locations, which is particularly useful if we  need to apply the same tax rule to a large group of states.  [ 155 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  Payment At the moment, we have only installed and set up one payment option, COD, which  is the Cash on Delivery option, which could also be used for posting a cheque, or  making a payment using a credit card over the telephone. This is a useful payment  option, but it is very limiting to have only this, and Doug wants to be able to   take payments automatically and from as many people as possible, as easily as  possible. In order to do this we need to install and configure a number of other  payment gateways.  Before we install and set up these gateways let's first look at how they work, and also  which ones are available to us.  How Payment Gateways Work Payment gateways, or payment processors, handle the payment process for us  working directly with banks and credit card providers to obtain the funds. The exact  method of each gateway varies, so here I will explain the basic details of how the  PayPal payment gateway works.                     The customer places an order on the website. The website creates the order and takes the customer to PayPal's website; in  the background the website tells PayPal information such as the contents of  the shopping cart, total cost, and the order's ID number. The customer either logs into their PayPal account to pay  which uses  either funds from the customer's PayPal account or their bank account  or  they enter their credit or debit card details. Credit card info is stored by the  gateway and is never known to the store, which is good, as it provides added  security to customers. PayPal verifies the details and charges the card or account. The customer is then returned to our website; if there is a problem with the  payment or they cancel the order they will be taken to a "cancelled page", and  if the payment is made, they will be taken to a "thank you" page. PayPal independently  so regardless of if the customer goes back to our site   sends a special command to our website containing information such as the  amount paid, the order ID, and some authentication method to prove it really  is PayPal. The website then checks the amount paid against the amount for the order; if  they match then the order status is updated to paid.  [ 156 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Payment Gateways Available There are eight different payment gateway modules available with Drupal   e-Commerce; more of course can be added by downloading additional modules   if they are available or by writing new modules.  Chapter 9  Bank Integration Kits Many banks have their own gateway methods that can be used,  sometimes only for their cards, other times for any cards. Banks that offer  these gateways generally provide integration kits to explain how   to use their API and how to integrate the payment solution with your  own website.  The gateways available are:                   Authorize.Net CCard COD Eurobill Eway iTransact PayPal WorldPay  Let's have a brief look at each of these:  The values for each of the payment gateways can be changed, you should  consult the gateway provider for exact, and up-to-date information  regarding the values required.  Authorize.Net Authorize.Net's services are sold via a number of resellers and as such their costs  vary depending on the reseller used. In order to utilize Authorize.Net, a special bank  account called a merchant account is required; these in themselves can incur set up  costs and per transaction costs, in addition to the set up costs and per transaction  costs of the payment gateway.  Some resellers of Authorize.net offer their services on a monthly charge as opposed  to charging set up fees and per transaction fees, whereas other resellers operate a per  transaction charge.  [ 157 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  A list of Authorize.Net resellers is available on its website: http:  www.authorize. net solutions merchantsolutions resellerdirectory .  CCard www.ccard.com.au is an Australian payment gateway; this gateway also requires a  merchant bank account to interact with and applications to sign up to this gateway  involve a paper-based application form, which can be downloaded from their  website: https:  ccard.com.au applicationkit.pdf.  The fees for this gateway  in Australian Dollars  involve an annual $300 charge and a  $0.20 charge per transaction. There is no minimum term to its service apart from a 30  day notice to disconnect from the service.  COD The COD payment gateway is the gateway we installed earlier in order to test the  checkout process. This gateway is useful  as we discussed earlier  for items where  you do require cash on delivery, or where the customer is posting a cheque to you  before their order is shipped, alternatively it could also be used for in-store collection  or telephone-based credit card orders  although for these you would need a payment  gateway with the capability of entering credit card details manually yourself, such as  PayPal's virtual terminal service .  Eurobill Eurobill can only be used to accept payment for digital content such as downloads  or software, and is not permitted by law to be used for the processing of transactions  that involve physical goods or products. Eurobill charges 14% of each credit card  transaction and 10% for direct debit transactions. There are no setup fees, no monthly  fees, and no set charges  only the variable charges  per transaction. More information  on Eurobill can be found on its website: www.eurobill.com eu .  eWay eWAY is another Australian-based payment gateway and is only available to  Australian businesses. It has two pricing plans; eBusiness Saver and eBusiness  Standard, both have the same set up costs of $599 Australian dollars, annual costs  are $199 and $285 respectively, including the first year, and per transaction charges  of $0.50. The only difference other than price between these two plans is that the  eBusiness Saver plan requires you to include its logo and a hyperlink to its website  on your website. A merchant account is required with your bank to use eWAY which  incurs further set up costs and per transaction costs. More information on eWAY can  be found on its website: http:  www.eway.com.au .

PayPal PayPal is an International payment gateway owned by eBay Inc. It is one of the most  popular payment gateways; it is used as the primary payment method for companies  such as eBay and Skype. The fees charged depend on which country your business  is based in and the total received monthly funds. There are no setup or monthly fees,  and its per transaction costs range from 1.9% to 2.9% plus USD$0.30.  A merchant account is not needed to set up a PayPal account; this combined with  the absence of set up or monthly fees make PayPal a very popular option. More  information is available on PayPal's website: www.paypal.com.  WorldPay WorldPay is a UK-based payment gateway owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland  Group; it has set up costs of USD$399 and monthly fees of USD$50. Per transaction  costs include a USD$0.40 charge plus from 3.25% to 5.25%. More information on its  costs can be found on its website: http:  www.worldpay.com usa sme content. php?page=pricing.

It may be appropriate  to choose another gateway later on  and possibly write a module for it  depending  on the monthly volume of transactions as that may prove to be more cost effective,  although from the gateways supported by default, PayPal also seems to be the most  cost effective in the long term.  Configuring the Payment Gateway Now let's set up and configure our store for the PayPal payment gateway, then let's  have a brief look at the configuration involved in the other gateways.  This assumes we have already set up an account with our payment  gateway and set up the account so that we can receive money.  To configure our store to use PayPal we need to go into the PayPal section within the  E-Commerce configuration section in the Administer menu.  [ 160 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   This section provides us with eight different settings; let's see what they are and  what they do:  Chapter 9                          PayPal receiver email—This is the email address assigned to our   PayPal account. PayPal processing URL—This is PayPal's web address for processing  payments; this would only need to be changed if PayPal were to change its  system to use a different URL. Successful payment URL—This is the page on our website where the  customer should be taken to if their payment is successful. Cancel payment URL—This is the page on our website where the customer  should be taken to if their payment is cancelled. PayPal IPN "request back" validation URL—If we use IPN where PayPal  "pings" our website to let it know the transaction went through, we can send  a request back to PayPal to prove this was valid; the address where we send  this request is the request back validation URL. This will only be changed if  PayPal changes its systems. Currency code—This specifies the currency that PayPal should use while  processing payments. Debug Instant Payment Notification  IPN —We may wish to check whether  the IPN system within PayPal is working correctly with our website. If we  enable the debugging of the IPN we will get an email each time it is used;  this way we can keep a check on it. Minimum purchase amount—This is the minimum amount of a purchase  before PayPal can be used as a payment gateway; this can be useful as with  some low transactions such as $0.20 products PayPal would take the entire  sum as the transaction fee.  At least one of these settings will require a new page to be created, this is for the  cancelled payment page, so before we go and adjust these settings let's create the  page for cancelled payments.  [ 161 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  To create the page we just need to click Create content and create a Page.  Doug wants a nice friendly page to make the visitor feel "welcome and wanted" even  though they have cancelled their payment.  Now that we have created this page, let's make a note of the URL so we can add it to  the appropriate setting. The part of the URL we need is node  and the following text:  From the URL we need to make a note of node 39 for the cancelled payment setting.  Path Module Drupal's core Path module can be used to create page URLs such as  Drupal-5.7 PAYPAL_CANCEL.  [ 162 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   IPN In order to set up PayPal's IPN, which allows PayPal to notify our website that a  transaction has gone through, we need to enter a special URL into PayPal.  Chapter 9  To set this up for Doug, we need to:  1.  Log in to PayPal.com 2.  Go to our Profile in PayPal 3.  Under Selling Preferences select Instant Payment Notification Preferences 4.  Click Edit 5.  Check mark the box to enable IPN 6.  Enter the URL from above into the relevant text box 7.  Click Save  [ 163 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping Settings Now that we have set up IPN and have a page for cancelled payments, we can  change the PayPal settings. The first two settings are the PayPal Receiver Email and the PayPal processing URL.  Doug set up a PayPal account using the email address billing@dougsdinos.com;  he used a separate email address so that he can keep billing and payment issues  separate from other emails. The processing URL can stay the same, as it only needs  to change if PayPal changes its systems. The next settings are the Successful payment URL and Cancel payment URL.  Doug likes the idea of taking the customers to the order history page once the  payment has been completed, so let's leave that setting as it is. As for the Cancel  payment URL let's use the page node 39 we created earlier; now when customers  cancel a payment they will be taken to this page.  [ 164 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   The remaining settings are PayPal's IPN "request back" URL  which we don't need  to change , the currency code, debug settings, and minimum purchase amount:  Chapter 9  Doug wants to leave the Currency code as USD as he is hoping most online orders  will be from US customers. He also wants to enable the debug options for IPN  just to make sure everything works as it should. For the final setting, he wants the  Minimum purchase amount to be reduced from five to one; this way any transaction  that could entirely be consumed by PayPal fees cannot be purchased using PayPal,  but also allows lower value products to be purchased using PayPal which is a  convenience for customers.  Payment Gateway in Action Now if we go and place an order, we have the option to choose the payment  gateway. At the moment, we have the options of COD or PayPal. Let's choose  PayPal and see how it links into our store:  [ 165 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  On the following page, which asks us to review the order, it confirms the payment  method we wish to use and includes a link to change the method.  A Quick Look Back at Tax Earlier in the chapter we set up various tax rules. We can now see the tax rules in  action on the Order Summary page:  Place the Order If we now click on the Place your order button we will be taken to the PayPal  website to pay for our orders.  If we cancel the payment, we will be taken to the cancel page we created earlier, and  if we make the payment we will be taken to our order history page.  Settings for Other Gateways Here we have focused on PayPal, so let's have a very brief look at the settings for  using the other payment gateways.  Authorize.Net The Authorize.net module has the following settings:        Explanation or submission guides—This is a note displayed above the page  where the customer enters their credit card details; this is used by default to  warn customers about submitting the form twice, and how it can result in  being charged twice. Login ID—This is our login ID with Authorize.net.  [ 166 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065                          Chapter 9  Transaction key—This is the transaction key for the website set up to use  Authorize.Net. Authorize.net processing URL—This is similar to PayPal's processing URL;  we don't need to change this unless Authorize.net changes its systems. Successful payment URL—This is the URL the customer is taken to once they  have successfully paid for their order. Authorize.net test mode—If we enable this then credit cards won't be  charged and we can test to make sure the system works without having to do  real transactions. Email Authorize.net receipt—This sets if Authorize.net should email the  customer a receipt, in addition to the receipt the store sends them.  Ccard The Ccard gateway does not require much configuration, only a few settings like:  Ccard client ID—This is the ID provided by the Ccard gateway. Credit card payment page—This is the page on our store that contains the  payment details, automatically done via Drupal e-Commerce.. Thank you page—This contains the location of our thank-you page on   our website.  Eurobill Eurobill does not require much configuration either, just some details like: EuroBill username—This is our username for the EuroBill gateway. EuroBill site ID—This is the ID assigned by EuroBill to our site for reference. EuroBill security key—This is the security key provided by EuroBill to ensure  that we are communicating with the EuroBill servers.         Unfortunately this does not allow configuration of thank-you pages or cancelled  payment pages; these may be settable with the gateways own settings; for more  information contact the gateway.  eWAY Just like Ccard and Eurobill, eWay also does not require much configuration. The  few available configuration options are:          eWay client ID—This is our ID provided by eWay. Credit card payment page—This is the page on our store that contains the  payment details, automatically done via Drupal e-Commerce. Thank you page—This contains the location of the thank-you page on our site.  [ 167 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping iTransact Only four of the six configuration options can be altered, as the final two require  further development of the e-Commerce project for Drupal, and are there to serve as  a place holder for the future features.  iTransact client ID—This is the ID provided by the gateway. iTransact client password—This is the password for the gateway. Credit card payment page—This is the page on our store that contains the  payment details, automatically done via Drupal e-Commerce. Thank you page—This contains the location of the thank-you page on our site. The CVV field is required. The Address field is required.  WorldPay WorldPay has quite a number of configuration options, including:  Installation ID—This is the installation ID assigned by WorldPay. Testing Mode—Sets whether the test modes are used or not. Currency code—This is the option where we enter the code such as USD or  GBP for the currency we are using. WorldPay minimum amount—This is the minimum amount of the order  before WorldPay should be available to the customer to use. WorldPay processing URL—This is the web address the customer is sent to  on WorldPay's site to submit payment. Thank you page   World pay callback URL—This contains the location of the  page on our site where the customer is directed to after:         Worldpay_callback—Payment completed message Worldpay_callback—Order cancelled message Worldpay_callback—Server validation check failed message                                   Switching debug mode on.  Shipping We can now take payment from a lot of potential customers with the   payment gateway set up; now let's look at one of the final parts to the order  process—shipping!  [ 168 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   There are two methods for adding shipping charges within Drupal e-Commerce:  Chapter 9       Shipping API Flexicharge  Let's take a look at these two methods:  Shipping API Firstly we need to install the Shipping API and at least one shipping module; by  default there is only one shipping module, which is Shipcalc, a module containing  APIs for UPS and FedEx. We install them from the Modules section from   Site building:  The modules should now be installed. If we now go to the Shipping section within the E-Commerce configuration area, we  will see the following screen:  This area lists the shipping APIs that are installed; the module includes APIs for:           Australia post Canada post UPS USPS  [ 169 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  These APIs are used to calculate shipping costs, as they communicate with the  appropriate companies to determine the cost. To use the Australia Post module we need to enter our Post code, Turn Around  Time, and the Domestic Registered Post Cost. CanadaPost requires a Merchant  ID, which is obtained free when registering at: http:  www.canadapost.com  business intsol sb ventureone default-e.asp?source=web as well as a Potal  Code and Turn Around Time. UPS requires us to register and obtain an API key, and USPS requires us to  register too. To register for a UPS account we need to go to: https:  www.ups. com servlet registration?loc=en_US, and then to this website to obtain a  developer API key: https:  www.ups.com e_comm_access laServ?CURRENT_ PAGE=INTRO&OPTION=ACCESS_LICENSE&loc=en_US.  Once we have set up the APIs we need to set which shipping methods we want to  use with which product type; we do this by clicking the Products link next to APIs.  Next we select the type of products for which we want to enable the shipping APIs.  This then lists all of the different shipping methods available; we can select the ones  we want to enable for that particular product type.  [ 170 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   With the shipping options configured and installed, we now have some extra settings  available for each product. If we create a new shippable product or edit an existing  shippable product there is a new section called Shipping methods. This new section includes all of the shipping APIs that allow us to select the available  shipping methods  the same as when we were editing the shipping settings  as well  as settings for:  Chapter 9             Product Weight Product width  in inches  Product Height Product Length Product Width  in inches   Both values for width must be completed with the same value due to the  way certain shipping companies use the data.  By setting these options for each product our store can link into the various shipping  providers' API, send these details to it and obtain an accurate shipping cost to  charge the customer. The cost is added to the order summary towards the end of the  shopping process.  [ 171 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  Flexicharge Flexicharge is a simpler method of adding charges to orders, instead of linking in  with shipping providers; it allows us to create simple rules that add charges to the  order, similar to how the tax system works, although it supports more options. Let's  take a look! The Flexicharge settings are found under E-Commerce configuration, and on the  Flexicharge page any charges previously set up are listed and there is the option to  create a new charge, either a Site-wide charge  dependent on roles and products, and  which can be used to reduce costs depending on conditions  or a Simple shipping  charge. It is the Simple shipping charge we want, so let's create one of those. The flexicharge page has a link called Unallocated locations along with options for:         Enabling or Disabling a charge Base cost—A charge added to the item regardless of weight Cost per lb—Used to calculate shipping cost  This allows us to specify a standard shipping cost as well as a variable cost  depending on the weight of the item, and of course we can enable or disable the  charge at the check of a box.  These charges can be applied to a specific geographical region; we can even create a  region and add countries or states to the region.  Doug wants to add a charge to a number of non-UK countries, so in order to create  a charge for this we need to create the region. To create the region we need to follow  the link to Shipping regions and configuration, which is in the same area as creating  a new flexicharge.  On the page to which we are taken to there is a link for Add region.  [ 172 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   We can now assign countries to the region by clicking the Configure link next to the  region. To assign a country to the region we click the radio button for Europe:   Non-UK for each country we wish to assign to this region.   Chapter 9  Now if we return to the flexicharge area and select the region, we can create a charge  for those countries.  The charge above would add a cost of $5 to each purchase in that region and an  additional $1.20 for every pound of weight.  If creating this flexicharge results in an error, you may need to create a  charge for all regions  all are on the same screen  at the same time, using   0 as the values.  There is only one final thing to do in order for this charge to work fully, and that is  assign weight to the products.  Although there was a weight setting in the shipping modules earlier, if  we are using a flexicharge, we need to set a separate weight setting    as flexicharge does not depend on having the shipping module installed,  it cannot rely on using the shipping module's weight settings for   each product .  [ 173 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Taxes, Payment, and Shipping  If we create a new product or edit an existing product, we should now have options  for weight under a heading of flexicharge attributes.  Now if we try to purchase a product that has a weight using a shipping address to  which the flexicharge rule will apply, we should see an additional charge for   the shipping.  It works! So we can now use flexicharges to add shipping charges to orders.  Discounts Don't forget, flexicharges can be used to create discounts too! This can  be useful if we wanted to offer a discount on shipping when products  are over a specific weight; this could be an incentive to customers put off  ordering heavy or large products.  Summary In this chapter, we set up Doug's website to accept payments online using PayPal as  well as looking at how payment gateways work and which other payment gateways  are available. We also set up tax rules, configured shipping rules, and APIs to add  shipping costs to orders. We now have a completely functioning store! In the next  chapter we will look at getting our store online, as well as securing and maintaining  our store.  [ 174 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Securing, Deploying, and  Maintaining Your Shop  Our store is now fully working and can handle taxes, payment, and shipping; let's  now look at securing, deploying, and maintaining our store. If we are working on  our store on our own computer and not online, a few things could not work correctly   such as the pingback requests from PayPal  so we will have to make a few changes.  In this chapter you will learn:  The importance of security Drupal security About Secure Socket Layers Password and phishing security Deploying your site Handling orders  although we will look at it in more detail in   Chapter 11—Invoices and CRM  Backing up and restoring your store  Importance of Security We need to secure our store for a number of reasons including:  To protect our website To protect our business To protect our customers                         This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining Your Shop  Drupal Security Drupal is an open-source content management system which contains readable  source. In terms of security this is both a good and a bad thing. It is bad because  anyone can find security risks in the code with the code being readable, but  conversely it makes it easier for someone to find a bug and get a security   issue fixed.  Security Announcements Drupal releases security announcements on a special dedicated section of its website  which makes it easy to keep up with the latest security patches. This section is  available at: http:  drupal.org security.  On this page there is also a mailing list sign-up box; by signing up to this we will  receive emails each time a new announcement is released by Drupal's security team.  There is also a link to the security team's own page within the Drupal site. They can  be contacted with any security concerns regarding Drupal's code, so if you find a  security issue somewhere, let them know and they can create a patch for everyone to  use to secure their own Drupal installations.  It is highly recommended that e-commerce sites utilizing Drupal  subscribe to this list.  Securing Our Drupal Installation Other than keeping up with any Drupal security announcements, there is little we  can do to secure Drupal's code; however, there are some modules we can install that  can help protect and secure our website. These modules are:              CAPTCHA—This prevents automated "web bots" from using and submitting  "web bots" from using and submitting "web bots" from using and submitting  web forms in our website. Email verification—This performs some additional checks to see if an email  address is a real email address. Legal—This is not specifically security related, but adds a terms and  conditions box for users who sign up; this can inform them of the rules,  regulations, and policies of the website. Log in security—This adds additional protection to user accounts and log in.  [ 176 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 10  CAPTCHA The CAPTCHA—Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans  Apart module installs a Turing test to prevent automated "web bots", such as the  ones that automatically post spam messages onto forums, from submitting web  forms on the website.  There are two kinds of CAPTCHA tests, ones utilizing text and ones utilizing images;  a number of things need to be considered before using the image methods in the  module, as it raises accessibility issues. For more information on those, and for  alternative methods to the visual Turing test, have a look at the World Wide   Web Consortiums working group note on the subject—http:  www.w3.org  TR turingtest .  The module can be downloaded from the Drupal website: http:  drupal.org  project captcha. Once it has been downloaded, we need to uncompress the file,  and put the captcha folder into the modules folder in our Drupal installation. With the files in place, we now have a new group of modules called Spam control  in the Modules section of the Drupal administration area. Let's check the boxes to  install them!  We can now get to the CAPTCHA settings from Administer  User Management or   http:  localhost drupal-5.7 admin user captcha . The settings allow us to  add a CAPTCHA element to the various different forms including the contact form,  and registration forms and then set it if we want to challenge the user to prove they  are human.  [ 177 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining Your Shop  There are three different CAPTCHA "challenges" available with the module,   they are:          Math  this uses plain text, and does not have any accessibility issues linked to  the image type  Image Text  There is an Examples tab on the same page to see how each of these works. Math The math CAPTCHA challenge presents the user with a basic math sum to complete,  as shown by the example below:  Image The image challenge presents the user with an image containing a number of  characters. We can select the font type and the level of noise or distortion in the  background for the characters used from the Image CAPTCHA tab. The user must  then correctly enter the characters from the image, which can in some cases be  difficult to read, into a text box.  [ 178 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Text This challenge provides a phrase and asks for a portion of the phrase to be entered  into the text box.  Chapter 10  Setting it Up Doug does not want to make the "challenges" inconvenient for his customers; he  wants them to appear only on the contact and registration forms, and wants to  challenge a user only once. He also wants to use only the Math challenge, as he  always finds the image challenges on other websites frustrating.  [ 179 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining Your Shop  If we now log out, and try to register for an account we should be presented with the  Math CAPTCHA challenge.  If we enter the answer to the math question incorrectly we are presented with an  error message indicating that the question was not answered correctly.  Hopefully with these changes, Doug's Dinos will be protected from automated  spam robots; unfortunately though, spam can still get through if it is submitted by  a human, and of course spam bots are always evolving to try to beat the various  CAPTCHA systems. So it is worth keeping an eye on the CAPTCHA module to see if  it improves or changes.  Email Verification This module performs additional checks on email addresses entered into the  registration form to ensure the address is valid. Firstly it checks to see if the domain  name within the email address is valid; then it contacts the SMTP server linked to the  email address and sends it a number of commands to try and determine if the server  acknowledges the existence of the email addresses. The module can be downloaded  from the Drupal website from http:  drupal.org project email_verify.  There are no configuration options with this module, so once it is installed—that's it!  Legal The legal module displays terms and conditions to users who want to register on  the website and will not accept their registration unless they agree to the terms.  Although this is not directly linked with security, terms and conditions can be used  to provide a disclaimer for content and to explain what is and is not allowed on the   [ 180 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   website or that anyone violating the terms and conditions may be reported to their  ISP. This may help legally when dealing with user-submitted content or disabling  user accounts.  Chapter 10  You should seek legal advice regarding terms and conditions on websites  in order to get accurate information on their use and enforceability.  The module can be downloaded from the Drupal website—http:  drupal.org  project legal. Once it is downloaded, decompressed, and uploaded into the  modules folder we have a new module to enable in the Modules section of Drupal's  administration area.  The settings for the Legal module can be found under the Site configuration section  of the Administer area.  The module provides us with the following settings:             Style of displaying the terms and conditions—How the terms are displayed  on a page. The terms and conditions themselves. Additional checkboxes—This would be useful if we were to enforce an age  limit, and could act as an option for confirming whether the user is over a  certain age. Explain changes—When changes are made to the terms, we should add a line  explaining the changed areas for users who had signed up with the previous  terms and conditions, so that they can get an overview of the changes made  to those terms and conditions.  [ 181 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining Your Shop  Doug only wants some basic terms and conditions with no additional checkboxes, so  let's set that for him.  Once the terms and conditions are saved, we can see a preview of how they will   be displayed.  [ 182 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 10  Login Security The Login Security module provides features that it categorizes as soft and hard  protections; soft protections just offer delays, which can help slow down attacks,  whereas hard protections require an administrator to intervene to reactivate an  account or allow access from a host. These are:  Request time delay  soft protection —This time delay is used when log in  requests fail; to try to prevent, or at least reduce the effectiveness of brute  force attacks. Block log in forms  soft protection  Block account on a number of failed log in attempts  hard protection  Block IP address on a number of failed log in attempts  hard protection   Let's install this module; we need to download it from http:  drupal.org  project login_security, decompress the files, and upload them to the modules  folder within our Drupal installation. The final step to install the module is to check the Login Security box from the Other  category on the Modules page.  The settings for this module are in the User settings part of User management; the  individual settings available are:  Track time  Login delay base time Maximum number of login failures before blocking a user Maximum number of login failures before soft blocking a host Maximum number of login failures before blocking a host Notifying the user after any failed login attempt Messages to be shown on each failed login attempt, for banned hosts, and  when a user is blocked by their ID If an email should be sent to the administrator when a user is blocked, and  the contents of that email  [ 183 ]                              This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining Your Shop  The Track time is the length of time for which failed logins are recorded; so if the  maximum log in failures was three, and the track time was 1 hour, the three failed  log in attempts would have to be within the one hour. The Login delay base time is  a multiplier to define the delay the user has before being able to log in again from a  failed log in attempt; this is multiplied by the number of log in attempts.  The soft host block would prevent that host from logging in once they had   reached the limit, whereas the hard block would not allow them use the site at   all—even anonymously.  The messages to display to the user as well as the email template to be sent to the  administrator are stored within the expandable Edit notifications section.  [ 184 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 10  Passwords This may seem obvious, but password security is commonly overlooked by many  people. Your Drupal password gives access to the administration area of Drupal,  which could allow someone who obtained it to completely destroy the store as well  as obtain and potentially abuse customer data.  Weak passwords can either be guessed or obtained by "dictionary attacks" on a user  account; dictionary attacks are an automated process where a computer program  tries words from a dictionary list in the hope that one of them is the password. We  took steps to prevent this by installing the Login Security module; however, that  does not mean we can safely use weak passwords. What makes a strong password?                 Mixture of letters and numbers Use of special characters i.e. @,  , \, etc. Being at least eight characters in length Being unique  don't use the same password for multiple things  If it includes a word  don't use the word itself as the password  the word  should be spelled wrong Not contain personal information such as names, or date of birth  You might find substituting certain letters with numbers a good method to start  introducing numbers into your password, but try to use most of those points above  to use a secure password!  Phishing As well as being aware of phishing yourself, it might be a good idea to promote  understanding of phishing with emails sent out by your Drupal e-Commerce store.  A number of large online retailers generally provide advice in their emails informing  customers that their staff will never ask for specific pieces of information and that  if they are unsure whether the links in an email are valid they should go to the  homepage directly and navigate to the appropriate section.  With Drupal e-Commerce's email system it is very easy to add such notes to the ends  of emails, including customer welcome emails, invoice emails, and confirmation  emails. They can be changed from Administer  E-Commerce configuration  Mail.

What do we need, and what do we need to do, to get our website online?         We need a web hosting account to store our shop. We need a domain name, and a web address to point to the website. We then need to upload our website to the hosting account .  Hosting and Domain Names The Internet is saturated with web hosting companies and domain name registrars;  most hosting accounts come with a control panel making it easy to administer an  account  such as adding email addresses, changing passwords, etc. . Two of the  most common control panels are cPanel and Plesk; if you do get a hosting account  with cPanel  which is what the rest of this chapter assumes  you may find this book  helpful: cPanel User Guide and Tutorial by Aric Pedersen ISBN 978-1-904811-92-3  published by Packt Publishing  http:  www.packtpub.com cPanel book .  There are quite a few criteria when looking for hosting accounts such as the level of  support offered, the amount of disk space provided, the amount of bandwidth  that's  the data transfer from your site to your users , minimum contract term, uptime  guaranteed, and of course the cost.  There are a number of popular hosting comparison and review websites around,  including www.webhostingtalk.com.              Some popular web hosts include:  1&1 Internet Inc    www.1and1.com  A Small Orange    www.asmallorange.com  DreamHost  www.dreamhost.com   Along with a host, you will also need a domain name e.g. www.dougsdinos. com. There are a large number of domain registrars around too; prices are quite  competitive, and you should expect to pay less than USD$10 per year for a domain  name. Some popular registrars include:  Namecheap    www.namecheap.com  GoDaddy    www.godaddy.com   Once you have a domain name, you will need to point it to your hosting account by  updating its name servers with those provided by your host  contact your host for  more information .

This involves:             Creating a user account for the database Creating a database and assigning the user account permissions to it Uploading the store Importing the database Altering some of the settings to use the database on the hosting account  Let's get started!  Setting Up the Database We need to log in to our control panel, and go to the databases section in cPanel. This  is the MySQL logo on the main page.  From the page that we are taken to we can create the database, create a user for the  database, and assign the user to that database. Firstly we need to create the database.  Next we need to create a user for the database.  [ 187 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining Your Shop  Then we need to assign the user to the database we have just created.  Now that we have a database and a user who has permission to access the database  we can transfer the store's database to the new database on the hosting account.  We now need to export a copy of the database from our local installation of Drupal  and then import this copy into the database we have on the web server. Our local  copy of phpMyAdmin should be located at http:  localhost phpmyadmin ; from  here we need to select the database from the list.  Once we have selected the database, we need to select the Export option from the top  of the page.  [ 188 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Within the export area, we need to select the database tables we want to export;  obviously we want to export all of the data from the database so we click the Select  All link to select all of the tables from the list.  Chapter 10  Then to actually save the data as a file, we need to check the Save as file box and  click the Go button.  This should then download the data in an SQL file onto our computer. Now we need  to import this data into the new database on the web server.  Firstly, we need to log in to our control panel, and select the MySQL logo to go to  the database area. At the bottom of this page there is a link to the phpMyAdmin  installation on the server—let's click that. Within phpMyAdmin we need to select  the database we created earlier from the left-hand side of the page, and then click  the import tab from the top of the page. On the import page there is a section with  the heading File to import; we use the file Browse box to select the database file we  downloaded onto our computer.

Large SQL File Some web hosting control panels have restrictions on the size of file you  can upload, which can cause problems when importing a large database.  If the database file is large it can be exported in parts, for instance we  could create a file for a few tables. By importing these smaller files one at  a time, we can bypass this problem.  Uploading the Store Since we have the database set up and ready on our web server, we now need to  upload the files from our local installation, otherwise we will just have a completely  blank website!  To upload the files we need to use an FTP program; personally I prefer   FileZilla—a free open-source lightweight FTP client  you can download it from  http:  sourceforge.net projects filezilla  .   With our FTP client, we enter the server's username and password to connect to the  server, navigate to the public_html directory, and then transfer all of the Drupal  files there.  [ 190 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 10  Tweaking the Settings We have the database set up, and also have the files uploaded, but the files don't  know about the new database yet, and so the website won't work. The database  connection details are stored in a configuration file called settings.php in the  sites default folder. We need to edit this file, either using a PHP editor  such as  Crimson Editor, or PHPEclipse  or something simple like Notepad.  Within this file we need to look for a line starting with $db_url =, and then we need  to alter the line to contain the new username, password, and database.  For the database we set up earlier the line should now read $db_url = 'mysql:   dougsdin_doug:dougspass@localhost dougsdin_dougsdb';  We have now successfully deployed our store online!  SSL SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It is a cryptographic protocol that provides  secure communications on the Internet. It works by using encryption methods to  encrypt data which is then transferred over the SSL connection. Standard web page  requests are not in SSL and data sent from the client  browser  to the web server are  sent in plain text, which could in theory be read by third parties. SSL connections  encrypt this data so it cannot be read, and can only be read by the server. Wikipedia  has a very detailed entry on Transport Layer Security, if you are interested in   how SSL works and the technicalities of it—http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Secure_Sockets_Layer. The use of SSL in Drupal is not easy or available out of the  box; there are a number of discussions on the Drupal website regarding setting up  Drupal for SSL, including http:  drupal.org node 60222. Along with configuring  Drupal you will also need to purchase and install an SSL certificate.  An SSL certificate is used to verify the identity of the server and is used when  encrypting the data sent to and from the website. SSL certificates are available for a  variety of prices, normally depending on the company that "signs" the certificate; this  usually involves a trusted company verifying your own identity and then issuing the  SSL certificate. Once you have the certificate you would then need to contact your host  to get SSL set up on your hosting account, which would also require an additional  dedicated IP address for your hosting account, which may incur additional charges.

If you  are running a very popular store dealing with lots of sensitive data then it would  almost be essential to set this up.  One of the advantages of the payment gateways used to make online payments is  that they handle the card transactions, and they have secure websites, so at least that  information is processed securely outside of our site.  Maintaining Our Website With our store now online we need to look at maintaining our website on a regular  basis, including making changes to the website and store, handling orders, and of  course backing up, and if needs be, restoring our website from a backup.  Performing Maintenance Content on websites often needs to change regularly, as does the content of our  stores. Some changes, such as small content changes, can just be done there and  then with the website online, whereas other changes such as a reorganization of the  store or revamp of the product lineup would need the website to be taken offline to  prevent customers purchasing products that are no longer being sold, or products  with an old price associated with them.  Drupal has a maintenance option, which can be used to essentially block the website  from the public, and display a message to visitors explaining that the website is  down for maintenance. This maintenance option is found under Site maintenance within the Site  configuration section of Drupal's administration area.  There are two simple settings in this area:       Site status—This is used to set the status of the site i.e. Online or Off-line. Site off-line message—This is a message which is displayed to visitors if the  website is in maintenance mode i.e. Off-line.  [ 192 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   When Doug wants to perform maintenance on his website he wants to display a  message to his customers telling them that the website is currently offline while the  website is being improved and that it should be back online shortly.  Chapter 10  If we remain logged in and have a look at the homepage of the site, we can still  access the site, but there is a small notice to remind us that the website is still in  maintenance mode.  However, if we logout and take a look at the homepage we get a completely different  page, which contains the maintenance message.  [ 193 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Securing, Deploying, and Maintaining Your Shop  With this message we can easily make changes without worrying about customers  getting confused or accessing content or products that are being updated.  Logging back in To log back in to your Drupal website when it is in maintenance mode  you need to go to the user page, so for Doug's Dinos we go to dougsdinos.com user.  page, so for Doug's Dinos we go to www.  Handling Orders If we go to the E-Commerce section in the Administer menu we have a small  information box with some basic statistics about orders in the system.  Each of the links in the box takes us to the list of orders with their status in the "order  workflow". Orders go through a workflow starting from when the order is placed  with pending payment, to payment made, to shipped, or cancelled. If we click the  Payments pending link we will see all orders that still require payment. If payment  is made manually, for example a cheque in the post, we would need to edit this  transaction manually to set the transaction as paid.  The edit link allows us to edit the Payment status, Username, E-mail address, and  the Transaction workflow status. On the transaction's list shown above, we can directly edit the workflow by clicking  the status of the transaction's workflow; this presents us with a pop-out box with a  list of status.  [ 194 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Here we can print an invoice, set the order as shipped, ask the customer a question,  or cancel the transaction.  If we wish to ask the customer a question we are taken to an email screen where we  can compose an email to the customer asking them any questions we have regarding  their order.  Chapter 10  If we check the Change Workflow box then the workflow status will be set to  awaiting customer response to remind us that we are waiting to hear back from the  customer before sending out their order.  Backing Up and Restoring Your Store It is very important to take regular backups of our store; if something were to happen  to the website, the hosting account, or the web server our website is stored on, we  could loose all sorts of data, including orders that we still need to fulfil but that have  been paid, or information regarding payment on orders. This could cost the business  a lot of money.  How regularly we need to take backups depends on how often we make changes to  the website and how often we receive orders. Backups can of course be automated,  but that is a little more complicated and relies on having access to cron jobs on your  hosting account. Some hosting accounts include backups with several day retention  policies. This is something else to consider when looking for a hosting provider.

For more  information on backing up using other hosting control panels, you should contact  your host or the manufacturer of the control panel. From the main page in cPanel there is a Backups link.  Within this section we have links to Download a home directory Backup as well as  links to download the backups of the various databases on the account.  The home directory contains all of the files and settings, including any emails, logs,  and statistics. The database will require more regular backups, however, as it is the  data that changes the most and this is where all orders and transactions are stored.  Restoring To restore a backup we need to go back into the Backups area of cPanel and on the  right-hand side of the page there are upload boxes for restoring the home directory  backup and for restoring the database.  Once the files have been uploaded using this form the contents will be used to  replace the existing home directory and the existing database.

We also set up a hosting account, created a  database, and deployed our website from our local installation into a live installation,  which can accept orders and generate business.  Finally we looked into how to maintain our store, how to process orders  we will be  looking more into order processing in the form of generating invoices and reports in  the next chapter , and of course how to back up and restore our store.

Let's now look at generating invoices and  reports for our store. In this chapter you will learn:           How to print invoices How to customize the layout of these invoices How to create and manage invoices using the invoices module How to install CiviCRM, and integrate it with our Drupal installation  Printable Invoices Within Drupal e-Commerce it is really easy to get a simple printable invoice from a  transaction. From the orders list, we just need to click on a transaction's workflow  status and then select print invoice.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM  When we click this a simple web page containing the invoice is displayed. We can  then print the invoice directly from the web browser; the simplistic design, size, and  style of the invoice makes it easy to print on a single sheet of paper.  The layout of the invoice is not particularly attractive, but for many it is fine.  Thankfully, we can quite easily customize the design of the invoice by editing a  single file.  Customizing the Invoice Design Doug wants to change the design; he wants us to make the following changes:       Add his logo to the page Add his contact details  [ 200 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 11       Move the order date and transaction ID to the top of the page Move the delivery and billing addresses to the bottom of the page  Before we make changes to the actual code that generates the invoice, let's first create  a new style, and then make the appropriate changes. The reason we should do this  is that since the invoice is generated on-the-fly from a function in the code  and not a  template, which is easier to change  bits and pieces of the invoice design are spread  across the code. If we make our design first, then we just need to copy bits of the  design, and paste them into the code.  New Design Layout The following design incorporates the changes Doug wanted.  Doug likes the new design, so we will keep it. Let's take a quick look at the code used  to create the invoice, and then we will look at moving the design into the module's  code to generate invoices that look like this.  [ 201 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM Code for New Design The first bit of the code is the head, which contains the title of the page as well as  style elements. As the style needed for the invoice is so minimal I've placed the CSS  within the HTML file as opposed to including a CSS file. If a more extensive CSS  was used, it would be better suited to its own file.

To make changes to the design of the printable invoice we need to take some code  from the store's module file, and place a copy in the theme's template file. The  module file is called store.module and is located in sites default modules  ecommerce store ; we should use a PHP or text editor to edit the file. A PHP editor  is best as they generally have better support for things like line numbers and syntax  highlighting, which we may find useful.  Within this file we are looking for a function called theme_store_invoice, which  is located on line 440. We need to copy this function, place it in the store's template  file, and then make quite a number of changes to this function in order to change  the style of the invoice as desired. The entire HTML of the invoice is stored and  generated in this function, which is good, because it means we only have to look   in one place.  Once we have copied the function, we need to open the template.php   file that is located in the folder for the theme we are using, which is in the   themes folder. Within this file, we should paste the function and rename it  phptemplate_store_invoice.  You may be wondering why we copied the code instead of just changing  it directly. The reason is if the module is upgraded, we would then have  to look into the code and reapply our changes.  The first part of the function does not need any alterations, as this is just building  up data, and performing some minor style changes  such as making some elements  bold , we need to start making changes from the line containing if  $print_mode  {.  This line and the eight following lines define the head of the HTML document, which  contains a link to the style sheet. The conditional if statement wrapping the code just  differentiates between viewing the invoice within Drupal or viewing it in a separate  page to print off.

Non-Printable Invoice CSS The customer can also view invoices  for transactions and for invoices  created using that module . The customer view of the invoice, however,  does not import the styles we have included there  as the head part of  the document is only included on the printable copy, as determined by  the: if  $print_mode  section of the code . So we may need to edit the section of the code . So we may need to edit the  CSS file used by the main theme if we want to have the same design for  customer invoices.

The next bit that we need to change is the main content of the invoice; we need to  change it from its original code:  $output .= <<<EOD            $site_name  [ 206 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 11                   $shipping_label        $billing_label                     $shipping_to         $billing_to                     $shipping_method_label                              $shipping_method        $email_label  $txn->mail         $items_label         $items_view        $payment_label         $payment_info _info EOD;  to our new code:  $output .= <<<EOD           <img           src="http:  www.dougsdinos.com files garland_logo.png"         title="Doug's Dinos Logo"  >         $site_name            Doug's Dinos LTD, Some Address, Newcastle               upon Tyne, NE1 123, T: 0191 645 0000      Date ordered:  10 01 2008<br                >ID: 00001                  Delivery Address:                $shipping_to       Billing Address:                $billing_to   $items_view  [ 207 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM       Delivery Method:               $shipping_method       Payment Information:               $payment_info      contact email: $txn->email      Unfortunately this does not look exactly like the invoice design we made as a  separate HTML file; let's take a look at the end result first, then have a look at why  there are some slight changes.  The main differences here are:         The table of items Format of the delivery address Format of the billing address  These particular pieces of data are formatted by various functions within the  e-Commerce module's theme system, the items within the transaction are  automatically built into the table; however, its general appearance is still improved.  The billing and delivery addresses are also formatted to include line breaks after  each section of the address. It is possible to change this, but it involves digging   [ 208 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 11  around other files and editing functions, which would make more difficulties if we  were to upgrade the version of the e-Commerce module in the future.  Invoice Module Doug wants to be able to take orders from certain regular customers and generate an  invoice for them, and mark that payment is due in four weeks time. This can be done  with the invoice module.  Installing the Invoice Module The invoice module allows us to create and manage invoices for our customers,  which can then be posted to them. The module is not enabled by default, so we need  to go into the Modules section under Site building and enable the Invoice module.  The module also provides us with some new settings within the Invoices section  under E-Commerce configuration.  Invoice Module Configuration Options These settings are for the Order of the Invoice Screens and for the Invoice Terms.  [ 209 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM  When creating an invoice we go through a number of screens before the invoice is  created; the order of these screens can be configured here. The Invoice Terms define  the maximum available time period until payment is due for a particular invoice.  The PHP documentation link and the GNU manual link contain details on the format  in which the invoice terms can be in.  Creating an Invoice To create an invoice, we must first select a user  either from the user management  area, or from a member's profile link ; unfortunately there is no quick link to creating  an invoice elsewhere.  If we go to the users list and then select a user from the list, on this page there is the  create invoice link.  The next stage is to select the billing address where the invoice would be posted; we  can select an address from the addresses stored for that user, or we can add a new  address by clicking on add a new address link. Once we have selected an address,  we click the Continue button to move on to the next stage.  The next stage is to add products to the invoice; we can do this in two ways: either  enter the ID of the product  a handy pop-up window listing product names and IDs  can be found by clicking on the list of all products link  or by entering the name  of the product and selecting the ID from the list. If we enter the name of a product,  the web page looks up all products starting with that word or those letters and lists  them, so we can select the one we want. When we select the one we want it adds the  ID number into the Product Ids field.  [ 210 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 11  To add more products we can click the Update Products button and then add more  products to the invoice; once we are finished we can click the Continue button. The final section allows us to review the invoice in a summary form, make any  changes to the addresses, and select if we wish to process the payment now, or if we  want to just save the invoice as it is.  [ 211 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM  If we do check the Process Payment Now button then the next page will ask us to  pay for the invoice now; otherwise the invoice will be saved on the user's account.  Managing Invoices Under the E-Commerce link in the Administer menu is a link for Pending Invoices;  within this page are any pending invoices on the system. We can see the invoices,  edit them, and delete them from here.  If we were to edit an invoice we can edit the billing address, products within the  invoice, and of course view the invoice.  All invoices are stored as transactions, and since installing the invoice module we  also have an additional column in the Transactions list, which is for the duedate of  the invoice.  We can also filter the Transaction list using the Search option based upon  transactions that have been invoiced, as well as by the duedate of the invoice.  [ 212 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices for the Customer Customers can either view their invoice from their own invoices where they can  view all of their orders from View your order history or view their pending invoice  from the edit pending invoice link.  Chapter 11  CiviCRM CiviCRM is a Customer Relationship Management application, although its primary  design is to serve advocacy, non-profit, and non-governmental groups. It can,  however, be integrated with either Drupal or Joomla! So let's have a look at what  integrating CiviCRM can do for us.  CiviCRM does not integrate, apart from sharing a few settings with the  e-Commerce functionality of Drupal; however, it can still be useful for  online stores, particularly with regular customers or regular follow-ups.  Doug wants to use CiviCRM to record communications with customers, such as  technical support phone calls, logging meetings, and scheduling bookings for groups  that arrange to visit his museum and store.  Installing CiviCRM The CiviCRM download page, http:  civicrm.org download, links us to  SourceForge to download the latest version. The version we have used is civicrm- 1.9.13019-drupal-php5.tar.gz.  [ 213 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM  The installation method we are going to use is the web-based automated  installer, that requires at least PHP 5, Drupal 5, and MySQL 4 with  InnoDB support. If you are not sure that your web hosting has the correct  versions, contact your web host.  We need to extract our newly downloaded CiviCRM archive, and upload this to our  Drupal website. The extracted folder civicrm needs to be uploaded to the sites  all modules folder on our site. CiviCRM is a large application, at about 30MB once  extracted, so it may take a little while to upload. A quicker way to upload would  be to upload the ZIP file, and extract it using a command-line interface, if available;  more information on that is available on the CiviCRM website.  If your store utilizes page caching, an additional step is needed to prevent  CiviCRM pages being cached; see http:  wiki.civicrm.org  confluence display CRMDOC Automated+Installer+for+Drup al for more information.  Once uploaded, we need to go to the automated installer, which is located at   http:  www.dougsdinos.com sites all modules civicrm drupal-5.7  install index.php. The installer tells us there is an error, informing us that Your  database settings don't appear to be correct. Please check the Database Details  below for specific errors. This is because we have not told CiviCRM our database  connection details.  Once we have entered the connection details we need to click the Re-check  requirements button. Once that has been checked we can click the Install CiviCRM button to install  CiviCRM.  [ 214 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 11  Installing without the Automated Installer Your web server may not have the correct version of PHP or MySQL to use the  installer, or it may not support InnoDB format for the databases. If that is the case we  can manually install CiviCRM.  We need to open PHPMyAdmin and select the database we want to use, such as  our Drupal database, and then click the Import tab at the top to allow us to perform  some SQL commands to set up the database. From this page we need to browse  to the civicrm_41.mysql file from where we extracted CiviCRM on to our local  computer, which should be in the folder civicrm sql , then we need to click Go to  perform the import.  Next we need to import the data into the new tables that have just been created; we  just follow the steps above but select the file civicrm_data.mysql to import.  Finally, we need to edit the configuration file for CiviCRM. Let's open the sample  configuration file from our computer, edit it, and then upload it to our store; the  sample file is called civicrm.settings.php.sample.  Within this file we need to edit the following lines:                44  Drupal's database connection —We should use the connection string  from Drupal's settings file. 90  CiviCRM's database connection —If we are going to use Drupal's  database for CiviCRM data  we don't have to  we should also put Drupal's  connection string here. 134  CiviCRM path —This is the file system path to CiviCRM on our server. 135  CiviCRM template compiler path —This is the system path to  CiviCRM's template compiler. 169  Our site's URL —This is http:  www.dougsdinos.com .  More information and help on the values of these settings is available in the  comments of the configuration file itself.  The configuration file then needs to be saved with a new name of civicrm. settings.php and uploaded to the sites default  folder in our site.  Setting up CiviCRM CiviCRM is now uploaded and set up, and ready to use. Let's enable the module and  get it up and running!  [ 215 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM  To enable the module we just need to check the CiviCRM box in the Modules page  and then click the Save configuration button at the bottom of the page.  If there are any problems with our settings file, they will be pointed out to us now, so  we can correct them and try again. There is now a new option on the menu called CiviCRM.  The main page for CiviCRM contains a list of scheduled activities, which is  currently empty, as well as a Menu and list of shortcuts on the right-hand side.  We need to click the Administer CiviCRM link to perform some initial settings   and tweaks.  [ 216 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 11  The first thing we need to do is Synchronize Users to Contacts; this is because  contacts in CiviCRM are not the same as users in Drupal, but obviously if Doug  wants to use customers from his store in CiviCRM then we will need to perform this  synchronization routine, and perform it regularly too.  When we click on this link a pop-up will ask us to confirm the task, so we need to  click OK. A confirmation message confirms that the users have been converted to contacts   in CiviCRM.  Using CiviCRM CiviCRM is a large system, and would need a book of its own to explain how to use  all of its features. We will just have a look at some of its features here. Doug's main  use for CiviCRM is to log and schedule meetings and calls with some of his more  corporate clients, as well as log incoming technical support calls. This way he can  look up a customer and see all phone calls made and received relating to   that customer. If we click the Find Contacts link on CiviCRM's Menu we can then search for  contacts within the system; once we find a customer we can schedule and log  meetings, and calls with them.  [ 217 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM  The results are then displayed in a list on the next page.  If we then click on the Name of a contact  which is currently their email address from  the synchronization  we will be taken to that contact's profile where we can manage  their details, and log meetings and calls.  The profile is divided into tabs, each of which contains more information on the  contact, such as relationships to other contacts  useful if multiple contacts from an  organization are customers; we can record that one is the employer of the other ,  notes on a customer and so on.  The links just below the tabs allow us to log and schedule meetings and calls with  that customer. Let's look at logging a call.  The first few options allow us to enter a subject for the call, the telephone number  used to make a call  or the number used to call us , as well as the date and time.  There is even a calendar link so we can select the date from a calendar.  [ 218 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 11  The final options allow us to specify the duration of the call, the call status, and a text  box for details on the call.  With the call Status we can specify whether the call was completed, or scheduled, in  case the contact was unreachable or if a message was left for them. This will then add an Activity Type to the contact's profile.  [ 219 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Invoices and CRM  If the activity has not yet been completed it is added to the dashboard for CiviCRM  under Scheduled Activities.  So with CiviCRM Doug can manage all contacts with his customers, which can allow  him to ensure support contracts are cost effective, and schedule meetings, as well as  have a nice list of meetings and calls that need to be made in the near future.  Summary In this chapter we took our fully functioning live e-Commerce store and:           Customized the printable invoices Installed the invoice module Looked at how the invoice module works and tried it out Installed CiviCRM to allow Doug to manage appointments and log phone  calls with customers  In Chapter 12 we will look at Marketing Your Business!  [ 220 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Marketing Your Business  We have our store up and running, but there isn't any point in having an online store  without customers. Marketing our business and store is the key to generating new  business so let's have a look at it. However, even some simple site-based features and  enhancements can improve our businesses marketing so we will also have a look   at that.  In this chapter you will learn about:                Advertising programs Advertising on websites and newsletters Things to watch out for when advertising on other sites, or accepting adverts  on your website Viral marketing Using newsletters to market your business How to improve traffic with SEO  The Basics When it comes to marketing a business there are loads of different methods and  advertising mediums; the Internet provides many of them such as websites, blogs,  newsletters, and emails. By promoting our business and website on the Web we   can hope to drive more visitors and more traffic to our website, and thus increase   our sales.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Marketing Your Business  Update your Corporate Stationary One thing that a lot of existing businesses that set up a new website forget  to do is promote their website on their company's stationary. Update  your business cards, letterheads, invoices, and promotional material with  your web address. By doing this your existing customers, suppliers, and  those receiving your correspondence will know about your website! I  know from experience a number of clients who have commissioned a new  website, requested no Internet marketing and not updated their stationary  and wondered why no one was going to their website. The reason was  that nobody, not even their existing customers and some of their staff  knew it was there!  Advertising There are many different advertising programmes available on the Internet ranging  from simply purchasing some advertising space on a website, to using professional  advertising networks and search engines.  Buying Advert Space Some websites offer to sell advertising space on their site, and in some cases this can  be a great way to generate new traffic and business. Things to bear in mind while  considering buying an advertising space on a website are:              Does the website compete: If the website you are advertising on is a  competitor then it isn't a good idea to place an advert there! Is it relevant: It wouldn't make sense for Doug to advertise on a florist's  website, but it makes sense to advertise on websites aimed for kids, or   toy-related websites. What their statistics are like: There is no point in advertising on a website  that nobody visits, so always ask for information on their statistics. One  common pitfall here is hits versus visits. Some websites selling space may  just try quoting large figures at you, typically X thousand hits per day. A hit  is a single file request so if you load a webpage with 10 images that's 11 hits  that website has just had. A visit is someone visiting the website and loading  a number of pages and files, then going on elsewhere; that counts as a   single visit. Are they reputable: Try to make sure the website is reputable; if it operates  bad practices some will see an advert as a sign of affiliation or endorsement,  which wouldn't look good!  [ 222 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Chapter 12  Professional Advertising Networks  PPC  Some companies, particularly search engines, operate PPC advertising networks;  this stands for Pay per click. Let's have a brief look at how PPC advertising generally  works. First we sign up with the network, and submit information about the  website, the business, and billing information. Then we select keywords that we  want to target. These are keywords that someone may type into a search engine; the  advert would then be displayed down the side. Alternatively some website owners  monetize their website by displaying adverts from PPC advertising networks so  if their website contains related keywords, the advert might be displayed in their  advertisement box. Then we would enter how much we would pay, at most for each  click on an advert to our website relating to that keyword. The higher the cost the  more likely it would be displayed, and more prominently it would be displayed.  We may also set up a limit, or a monthly limit, so that once our bill for that month  reaches $50 the advertising campaign stops for that month. We would then be  charged for each time someone clicks on one of our adverts; the cost would be up to  the maximum amount we selected for the keyword, depending on the search itself,  and the position relative to other advertisers.  One potential issue with these schemes is fraudulent clicks, where  someone repeatedly clicks an advert in order to generate money for the  site displaying the advert. Networks have technologies in place to detect  this, with severe penalties, so it's worth checking which networks do and  don't penalize; after all we wouldn't want to pick a network that leaves us  vulnerable to wasting our marketing budget!

Search Engine Marketing: http:  sem.smallbusiness.yahoo.com  searchenginemarketing index.php  Microsoft Search Advertising: http:  advertising.microsoft.com search- advertising?s_int=277  [ 223 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Marketing Your Business  Product Search Some websites and search engines allow you to search specifically for products as  opposed to other information; an example of this is Google's Product Search, which  searches specifically for products. With this it is possible either to submit a single  product to the search engine, or to create a data feed  such as an RSS feed for our  store  that automatically updates with new products, which allows the search engine   to automatically update its own listings. More information can be found on   Google's Information for Sellers page: http:  www.google.com base help  sellongoogle.html.  Directories Business directories can often be a good way to advertise a website; they are  normally designed with SEO in mind so they are often found when looking for   one particular business or type of business. There are generally a few types to be  aware of:           Automatic directories: There are a number of automatic directories that crawl  the Web similar to search engines and "scrape" business information to create  listings; others rely on staff to perform the search and enter businesses. These  can be fairly good, but it's important to look for any existing entries on the  business and edit them to make sure the information is up to date. Free directories: There are also quite a few free directories relating to specific  industries or geographical areas. Paid directories: There are paid directories too, sometimes combined with  the free directories, where you pay to get extra information. Be careful with  these, as there can be a number of disreputable directories trying to scam  businesses for money. The Yellow Pages  in the UK and US  have free basic  listings on their website, but you must pay to display more information,  categories, and a web address. In some cases this can be well worth it; try  contacting such directories to discuss free trials, promotions, or cancellation  periods to give it a try. Don't sign up for a long commitment, try it, see   how well it improves the business, and then consider committing for a   longer term.  Newsletters There are two sides to newsletter marketing; advertising in a newsletter, and creating  a newsletter. We will look at creating a newsletter later on in this chapter; first let's  look at advertising in newsletters.  [ 224 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Essentially the same rules apply that did when looking for websites to advertise on.  It is of course more difficult to find newsletters to advertise in; however, there are  some websites dedicated to connecting newsletters with potential advertisers, such  as Carsonified's Amigo: http:  heyamigo.net. This website allows us to create an  advert, and manage its cost and budget, through its own PPC system.  Chapter 12  Things to Watch Out For when Buying or  Selling Adverts Buying or selling advertising space to either advertise your website or make some  additional money is often quite a good thing to do; however, in certain circumstances  it can do a lot of harm.  Search Engine Penalization Most search engines use a number of different metrics to determine where a website  is positioned in a list of search results. Some search engines, such as Google have a  metric  Google's is called Page Rank and factors in other things too  that is based on  in-bound links, where a website link from one site to another acts as a vote.  Some websites and businesses use this to their advantage, and offer to pay for  advertising space on other websites  normally ones that have a high ranking . This  way of both the buying and selling of advertising is not something that many search  engines like, and Google even has an online tool to report websites that do this,  which will result in their rankings being penalized.  Of course, there is nothing wrong with buying and selling advertising space, and in  fact one of Google's core businesses revolves around advertising space. The solution  is to alter how the link is structured.  A traditional link is structured as follows:    PacktPub   If this was a paid advert on our site  or if we were buying the advert space on a site   we should structure the link like so:   PacktPub   The 'nofollow' attribute signals to search engines that we don't wish for the link to  count as a vote towards that website's rankings, and so if this was an advert, we  would not be penalized by search engines for buying or selling it on a website.  [ 225 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Marketing Your Business  It is important to note that there is nothing wrong with providing links to  other websites without the rel='nofollow' attribute. The penalization  really only comes from adverts that are bought or sold and don't contain  this, as it is classed as a trick to fool the rankings.  Things to keep in mind:             Only purchase adverts, or buy adverts from reputable websites. Always use rel='nofollow' for adverts you are displaying on your website  that you are paid to display, and for adverts you have on   other websites. Beware of emails offering to pay to put adverts on your website; they  probably don't have the rel='nofollow' attribute. Don't risk your search engine rankings!  Social Network Marketing Most social networking websites available have provisions for user information and  profile data, including website addresses. We can add our URL to MySpace profiles,  Facebook profiles, Twitter accounts, and so on, to try to provide that extra promotion  to our site.  Facebook has a new addition to its website that allows business to create their own  profile page, advertising the business, its contact details, opening hours, as well  as hosting a discussion forum, photo gallery, and other features. We can of course  create a profile for our business and share the profile among our friends. Users of  Facebook can also become fans of businesses, promoting the businesses among their  own friends too.  Viral Marketing Viral marketing is a relatively new marketing concept, which revolves around  utilizing social networks. One particular example of viral marketing is utilizing  video sharing websites such as YouTube and promoting videos there that advertise  the business or its products. This technique  at least in that particular example   is probably more suited to large businesses with large marketing budgets who  are trying to promote a brand. Information on using YouTube in particular was  recently posted on a technology blog called TechCrunch, http:  www.techcrunch. com 2007 11 22 the-secret-strategies-behind-many-viral-videos .  [ 226 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Newsletter Marketing Earlier we had a brief look at advertising within a newsletter; the other side to  newsletters is of course creating one of our own to promote the business to existing  customers and other interested subscribers.  There are a couple of aspects to setting up a newsletter:  Chapter 12                      Subscriber Lists There are a few options for keeping and maintaining a list of subscribers to   a newsletter:  Subscriber lists The newsletter itself  Drupal module Server-based solution Hosted solution  There is a Drupal module available for mailing list management, which allows us  to embed a subscribe form on the website to request email addresses of interested  visitors to sign up to the mailing list. Unfortunately the module does not handle  creating the newsletters, it only distributes them to a list. There are some other  server-based software solutions that can be used, including mailman and phplist.  The final option is a hosted solution, where a third-party company manages the  mailing list on our behalf, such as SafeSubscribe or Constant Contact. Hosted  solutions like this provide extra security to those joining the list with regards to   spam and privacy.  The Newsletter With regards to the newsletter itself, this depends very much on the nature of the  business, and the intentions of the newsletter. Some general tips for newsletters and  their content:  Don't send newsletters too often, otherwise subscribers will get sick   and unsubscribe. Address each subscriber by their name, wherever possible. Keep them fresh; don't repeat the same content from previous newsletters.  Only send a new newsletter when there is new and fresh content available.  [ 227 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Marketing Your Business               If the newsletter is in HTML format, make sure there is a text version too that  can be read, not all users have HTML enabled on their emails or include a  link to the newsletter on a webpage; this way if there is a problem with the  email they can click the link and read it online. Don't attach files; link to them, this also saves cluttering up inboxes! Add something unrelated to some newsletters. I've seen some that I actually  enjoy receiving; these contain something quirky and unrelated at the bottom,  such as websites the author found interesting this month, and it also shows a  personal touch. Always ensure there are unsubscribing instructions in the newsletter. Appeal to both customers and potential customers with public newsletters   obviously just appeal to customers if it is a customer-only newsletter .  Improve Traffic with Search Engine  Optimization SEO can be a real traffic booster, as it makes our site more visible to search engines,  easier for them to read, and makes our site seem more important and more relevant.  There are two main aspects to SEO; on-site and off-site SEO.  On-Site SEO On-site SEO relates to making optimizations on the website itself. This improves  visibility and readability for search engines.  Meta Meta tags are tags stored in the head section of an HTML document, typically  for information such as keywords, description, and author of the website. This is  not regarded very highly by search engines anymore, but it is still worth doing,  particularly if different pages and sections have different metadata.  Sitemap Google has released some webmaster tools, one of which allows us to create a list of  the pages within our site, rank them in importance, and specify the frequency that  those sections will be updated. This is then saved as an XML file and stored on the  website; Google can then read it and see which content it should check regularly and  which content it should check rarely; this helps keep the website more relevant to  search engines.

A poorly optimized link  would be:  To view our products  click here .  The link has no context and no meaningful information; a more meaningful and  search-engine friendly link would be:  Why not view our   <a href="products " title="View our Dinosaur Products  Doug's            Dinos">list of dinosaur products   All these small changes do make a difference!  Staying Fresh Keep content up-to-date! If the content on our website is always the same, or rarely  changes, search engines  and visitors!  will stop coming to the website. Frequent  updates cause the search engines to pay more attention to the site. Blogs Having a blog as part of a website can help keep it fresh, and it's a whole new  area to try to attract and retain visitors that will help promote the main site. Many  businesses are finding it effective to set up company blogs, with posts' content  relating to the business and personal thoughts of some of the executives.  Off-Site SEO Off-site SEO is a large area, particularly useful for specific keywords to obtain  a specific ranking in search engines. It relies on promoting the website on other  websites, hence off-site.  As we discussed earlier, one of the metrics for a website's position in search results  is its in-bound links. Commenting on websites, blogs, forums, video posts, profiles  and so on with web links can increase a website's ranking. This should always be  done with care, consideration, and courtesy. Spamming websites with comments is a  very bad practice; however, relevant and appropriate comments with a link back to  our site, on relevant websites and articles is a good start. Many companies specialize  in this form of SEO, so if it is something you are serious about, it is worth looking  around to see what they can offer.

Installing WampServer Now we know what we need to install, let's get started!  Downloading WampServer Firstly, we need to download the software from the Internet. WampServer is  available at http:  www.wampserver.com en download.php; from here we click  from here we click  the DOWNLOAD WampServer 2.0 link, which then takes us to SourceForce to , which then takes us to SourceForce to  which then takes us to SourceForce to  download the application.

You must be logged in as an administrator to install WampServer.  The first window to be displayed warns us that we shouldn't try to upgrade from a  previous version of WampServer and that we need to uninstall any old versions; let's  click Yes so the installation can continue. Next we are presented with the installation splash screen; we need to click Next.  Next we need to read and agree to the license agreement for the software. Once   we have read it we need to select I accept the agreement before clicking the   Next button.  [ 232 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Appendix A  Now we need to select the location where we wish to install WampServer. If we are  happy with the default location we should click Next, otherwise we should change  the location first.  [ 233 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Installing WAMP  Next we have the option to add a shortcut to WampServer to our desktop and to the  Quicklaunch toolbar before clicking Next.  Before WampServer actually begins installing we are shown an overview of the  options we have selected; provided everything is fine we can click Install, otherwise  we need to click Back and make any relevant changes.  [ 234 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   Appendix A  WampServer will then install on our computer.  Once the installation has completed we are asked to confirm our primary web  browser; by default it has selected Internet Explorer. If we are happy with that we  should click Open, otherwise we should browse for an alternative browser first. otherwise we should browse for an alternative browser first.   Next the installation will ask for details on PHP mail; on most installations we won't  be able to send mail from PHP scripts as we have no mail server installed so just   click Next. We now have WampServer installed; if we click Finish WampServer will start.  Apache not starting? If WampServer has not started, the icon in the system tray will be red  or orange; this is likely because something else might be utilizing the  computer's port. Apache runs on port 80 programs such as Skype   also do this, so you may need to close other applications before trying   to start WampServer.  WampServer Overview When WampServer is running it is displayed in our computer's system tray  alongside the clock. Clicking the icon displays a menu where we can configure our  server, and start or stop various services.  Putting the server online would allow web pages on our computer to be accessible  to other computers on our network, and potentially via the Internet. We can quickly  start, stop, and restart the services, configure each of them, quickly open the folder  containing our website's files, and quickly open our website or database manager in  a web browser.

We can install modules and add-ons to the different  components, or we can edit the configuration files for them.  There are two main features that need to be enabled:       GD for PHP Rewrite_module for Apache  Configuration Files The files my.ini, php.ini, and httpd.conf are the configuration  files for the three services; although we shouldn't need to edit these for  our website, it is important to know where they are, in case we do need  to change them later, as they have a lot of control on how the software  works. More information is available on their respective websites.  GD2 PHP's GD2 module is a graphics library that allows PHP to easily manipulate and  manage images, including resizing images, recreating images, adding watermarks  to images, and so on. Drupal has a number of image features that require an image  module to be installed with PHP. By default GD2 is installed with WampServer, but  it is important that we check this and also that we know where the setting is.  PHP's modules are enabled and disabled by clicking the WampServer logo in the  system tray, selecting PHP and then PHP Extensions.  [ 236 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by lawrence rambert on 16th June 2009 2012 price st, , rahway, , 07065   From here we can enable or disable the GD2 extension.  Appendix A  Rewrite Module Apache has a module called rewrite_module, which allows it to rewrite URLs, in  particular to make them more friendly by rewriting URLs such as  home about to  index.php?section=home&page=about.  A number of Drupal's modules make use of this feature if it is available, so let's  enable it! It can be enabled from Apache modules within the Apache menu.
