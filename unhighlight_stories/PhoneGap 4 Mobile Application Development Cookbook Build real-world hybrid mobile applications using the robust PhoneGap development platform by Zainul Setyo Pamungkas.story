The sample applications here are based on real-world use cases   and are shown step by step. This book covers the standard workflow using the Cordova  command-line interface, and the extension of hybrid applications using various Cordova  plugins. It also covers the development of hybrid applications using the Ionic framework.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Welcome to PhoneGap 3, focuses on the new language enhancements and  command-line features in PhoneGap 3.  Chapter 2, Movement and Location – Using the Accelerometer and Geolocation Sensors,   is where we use built-in geolocation and accelerometer sensors. We create a mapping  tool using Google Maps to display the phone's location, as well as plotting markers in the  surrounding area.  Chapter 3, Filesystems, Storage, and Local Databases, looks into how to access, read, and  write to and from the local file storage; list the directory contents to browse the storage; and  also how to manage a local SQLite database.  Chapter 4, Working with Audio, Images, and Video, covers working with audio, images, and  video, including recording capturing and playback through local media and remote files.  Chapter 5, Working with Your Contacts List, illustrates how to manage, edit, and deal with  contact information on your device.  Chapter 6, Hooking into Native Events, this chapter tells you how to override and manage  native events using the PhoneGap library.  Chapter 7, Working with XUI, explains the available methods in the XUI JavaScript library.  Chapter 8, Working with the Ionic Framework, covers playing with the Ionic framework.  v  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9, Ionic Framework Development, look into the Ionic framework for layout and   style application.  Chapter 10, User Interface Development, shows you the available mobile framework layouts,  including jQuery mobile.  Chapter 11, Extending PhoneGap with Plugins, looks into creating a PhoneGap plugin across  the main device formats and implementing it in the code.  Chapter 12, Development Tools and Testing, covers the setting up of your development  environment and the ways to test your application.  What you need for this book Node.js is required throughout the book. PhoneGap and the Cordova command-line interface  utilize Node.js and NPM. Android Development Tool  ADT  is required if you want to build and  emulate PhoneGap applications on Android. To be able to develop for the iOS platform, Xcode  is needed. Unlike ADT, which can be run on major operating systems  Windows, Linux, and OS  X , Xcode can only be installed on Mac OS X.  Who this book is for If you are a developer who wants to get started with mobile application development   using PhoneGap, then this book is for you. Previous experience of command-line interfaces   the terminal or Command Prompt  will help, but it is not mandatory. A basic understanding   of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a must.

PhoneGap 3 is a big release in PhoneGap's history so far. In the older version, we  had to download PhoneGap manually every time there was a new release. The pain is now  over. With PhoneGap command-line interface  CLI , which was released along with PhoneGap  3, we are able to install PhoneGap directly from the command line.  PhoneGap 3 has improved the workflow for building cross-platform hybrid mobile applications.  Thanks to NodeJS, creating a new project, adding a device platform, building an application,  and running the application can now be performed from the command line. We don't need to  open our project using each IDE, which can save us a lot of time.  Being a hybrid application means PhoneGap can give access to native functionality using   web technology. We can add plugins to let our application get native capabilities. Adding  plugins is easy with PhoneGap 3. Unlike older versions of PhoneGap, where we added   plugins manually to each project, we can now use the CLI to add plugins to our project.  1  www.it-ebooks.info   Installing PhoneGap 3 Installing PhoneGap is as easy as installing the node package manager  NPM  package.  PhoneGap CLI uses NodeJS to power its command-line tool. NodeJS is a cross-platform  runtime environment that uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code. NodeJS  applications, including PhoneGap CLI, are written in JavaScript.  Getting ready Before installing PhoneGap, you will need to ensure that you have all the required elements,  as follows:   f A PC or Mac running Windows, OS X, or Linux. Note that you can build and run an iOS   application on OS X only.   f A text editor, preferably with syntax highlighting, such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text.  How to do it… As mentioned earlier, PhoneGap CLI is an NPM package, so we can easily install it using NPM.  To install PhoneGap CLI, follow these steps:  1.  First, we need to download and install NodeJS from http:  nodejs.org  for our   operating system. The installation process may be different for different operating  systems. To check whether it's installed or not, you can open the terminal or  Command Prompt  for Windows . Run node -v or npm -v. If you see the version  number, as shown in the following screenshot, it means that you have NodeJS  installed on your machine:  Checking the NodeJS and npm version  2.  Then download and install Git client from http:  git-scm.com  if you don't have   one already. PhoneGap CLI uses Git behind the scenes to download some assets  during project creation.  2  www.it-ebooks.info   3.   Install the phonegap module using npm. The phonegap module will automatically be  downloaded and installed by running the following commands:        On Linux and OS X: sudo npm install -g phonegap  On Windows: npm install -g phonegap  4.  Run the phonegap command on the terminal. You will see a help message, as follows:  Running the phonegap command to get a help message  How it works… PhoneGap CLI is an NPM module, which is why we have to install NodeJS first. The NPM  registry is located at https:  www.npmjs.org , and the PhoneGap CLI package is   located at https:  www.npmjs.org package phonegap.  The npm install command is a command used to install a new NPM module, and phonegap  is the name of the module. The npm will search for a module named phonegap in the registry  at https:  www.npmjs.org . Then, it will download the phonegap package along with its  dependencies. We don't have to worry about which dependencies are used by phonegap; npm  will do that for us. After the package has been downloaded successfully, npm will make the  phonegap command available from the command line.  3  www.it-ebooks.info   You might have noticed that we used a -g flag. This flag is used to install the module globally  on our machine. It's necessary to make the phonegap module available globally so that we  can run the phonegap command from anywhere, rather than only from a specific directory.  NPM is like gem to Ruby and Composer to PHP if you have worked with  Ruby or PHP before.  There's more… It's valuable to know how NodeJS and NPM work because PhoneGap CLI is an NPM package.   A public NPM package must be registered at https:  www.npmjs.org . Each NPM package  is versioned using Git and must contain a package.json file in the repository. The PhoneGap  CLI repository is located at https:  github.com phonegap phonegap-cli.  The following JSON code is the package.json file from https:  github.com  phonegap phonegap-cli blob master package.json:  {     "name": "phonegap",    npm module name     "description": "PhoneGap command-line interface and node.js       library.",    module description     "version": "3.5.0-0.21.18",    version number     "homepage": "http:  github.com phonegap phonegap-cli",          module homepage        repository type and url.

NPM will download and install every dependency referenced by package.json. You will  notice the cordova module among the dependencies. NPM will download the cordova  module too, so you can run cordova commands from your command line.  If somehow the cordova module is not installed on your machine  after installing PhoneGap CLI, you can install it manually by  running npm i -g cordova from the terminal. Apache Cordova  http:  cordova.apache.org   is the  software underlying PhoneGap. Previously, PhoneGap and Cordova  were one software project. But after Adobe acquired Nitobi, the  original developer of PhoneGap, PhoneGap code was contributed  to the Apache Software Foundation as Apache Cordova.  Creating a new project Creating a new PhoneGap project is easy thanks to PhoneGap CLI. Unlike older versions of  PhoneGap, where we needed to download the project template manually, we can create new  projects directly from the command line. With just a single command, we can create a new  project and start writing our application.  6  www.it-ebooks.info   How to do it… To create a new PhoneGap project, open your terminal or cmd. Then go to the directory where  you want to maintain your source code. Run the following command:  phonegap create hello com.myapp.hello HelloWorld  It may take some time to complete the process, so be patient and let PhoneGap CLI do its  magic. You will see some message during the project creation process:  Creating a new project progress  Congratulations! You have created your first PhoneGap project. Now, let's browse the project  directory. You will see the directories as shown in the following screenshot:  The PhoneGap project structure  Most of the directories are empty; we will discuss the use of each directory later in the next  recipe. The www  directory is where you write code for your application. PhoneGap generated  the initial starter app to work with.  7  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… The phonegap create command is a command used to create a new project. The first  argument, hello, specifies a directory for your project. Note that this directory must not   exist initially; phonegap will create it for you.  The second argument, com.myapp.hello, is your application ID. The application ID is used  as a unique identifier for an application. Two identical applications with different application  IDs will be considered two different applications. The application ID is in reverse domain style.  You can create something like com.yourdomain.applicationname.  The third argument, HelloWorld, is your application name. The application name will be  used as the application's display title. This argument is optional. If you are not setting the  application name, it will use the name from the first argument. If you want to change the  name, you can open config.xml and edit the name element.  While we are running the phonegap create command, there are several things happening  in the background:   f The phonegap creates a new PhoneGap project with the given name and ID   in the newly created directory. In our case, a PhoneGap project with the name   as HelloWorld and ID as com.myapp.hello will be created under the   hello directory.   f The phonegap downloads the starter application and places it in www  so that    we can run the project directly after creating it.  You can use the -d option with any phonegap command to allow a  verbose output. The -d option will give clear information about what  is going on and the current status of the command.  Using the command line After creating a new project, there are several things that need to be done before we are able  to run the project. The workflow of PhoneGap consists of the following mandatory steps:  1.  Creating new project. 2.  Adding device platform. 3.  Building the project. 4.  Running the project.  8  www.it-ebooks.info   How to do it… The PhoneGap command consists of two environments. The first is the local command  environment. The local commands execute the command on your local machine. In this   case, you must have the target device SDKs configured on your machine. For example,   if you want to develop an Android application, you must acquire and configure the Android  SDK on your machine.  The second environment is remote. Command-line commands execute the build process  remotely using the cloud-based PhoneGap Build service. In this case, you don't need to  configure any SDK on your local machine.  The local commands We created our first PhoneGap project in the previous recipe. The next thing to do is explore  the phonegap commands. Follow these steps to learn about the phonegap commands that  will be used to get your application running:  1.  Change the directory to your project directory. After creating a new project, simply run  cd hello to go to your project's directory. All further phonegap commands need to  be run in the project's directory.  2.  Before we can build and run our project, we have to add target platforms. The command   used to add the platform is as follows: cordova platform add    3.  The   argument is your target platform. The ability to build and run a  project on your machine depends on the SDK availability for your machine. On Mac,  you can run the following commands to add a specific platform: cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  cordova platform add amazon-fireos  cordova platform add blackberry10  cordova platform add firefoxos  On Windows, you can add these platforms: cordova platform add wp7  cordova platform add wp8  cordova platform add wp7  cordova platform add windows8  cordova platform add amazon-fireos  cordova platform add blackberry10  cordova platform add firefoxos  9  www.it-ebooks.info   4.  You may have noticed that we are using cordova instead of phonegap to add target   platforms. I mentioned that cordova is one of the phonegap dependencies, so all  cordova commands are available for the phonegap project.  5.  Let's add the Android platform for our project by running the cordova platform.   Add android. Now browse through your project using the file explorer. You will see  the android directory inside the platforms  directory. The android directory  is an Android project. You can open it on IDEs such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. The same  thing happens when we add the iOS platform. We will get the ios directory inside  platforms along with the Xcode project files:  The native project inside the platforms  directory  10  www.it-ebooks.info   When PhoneGap and Cordova release a new version, we should  update our platform-specific project by running phonegap  platform update  .  6.  The next step is to build the project. Building the project means compiling your  application into byte code for the target device. Run the following command to   build your project: phonegap build    7.  A PhoneGap application can run on the local development server. We can save time   by testing our application on the local development server instead of running on  an emulator or a real device. To run an application on the local web server, run the  following command: phonegap serve  8.  The serve command has some options:  --port, -p         Port for web server. Default port is 3000  --autoreload        Enable live-reload when file changes occur.  Default is true  --no-autoreload   Disable live-reload on file changes.  --localtunnel        Enabling local tunnel, will expose the local  server to the your network. Default value is false  9.  For example, to serve an application on port 1337 without auto-reload, you can run   the following command: phonegap serve -p 1337 —no-autoreload  10.  Install the application platform by running this line:  phonegap install    11.  The install command has some options:  —device            Force installation to device  —emulator        Force installation to emulator  11  www.it-ebooks.info   12. By default, phonegap will check whether you have a connected device or not. If a   connected device is found, your application will be installed on that device. If no  device is connected or found, phonegap will install it on the emulator. You don't   need to open your emulator; phonegap will run it for you:  A PhoneGap starter application installed on an iOS simulator  To be able to run an application directly on your Android device,  you have to enable USB debugging on that device.  13.  To run your application, you can use the following command:     phonegap run    12  www.it-ebooks.info   14.  The run command has some options:  —device            Force application to run on device  —emulator        Force application to run on emulator  15.  Just as with the install command, phonegap run will check whether you have a  connected device or not, by default. If a connected device is found, your application  will be run on that device. Otherwise, phonegap will run it on an emulator:  A PhoneGap starter application running on an iOS simulator  Congratulations!!! You have created your first PhoneGap application and successfully  launched it.  The remote commands The PhoneGap CLI also ships a tool for integrating our application with PhoneGap Build.  PhoneGap Build allows you to build your hybrid application without setting up any SDK   on your local machine. Using PhoneGap Build, you can create an iOS application from  Windows and create a Windows Mobile application from OS X.  13  www.it-ebooks.info   To be able to use PhoneGap Build and the phonegap remote command, you have to sign up  at http:  build.phonegap.com. Make sure that you don't use the GitHub single sign-on.  The phonegap remote doesn't support GitHub accounts. To use the phonegap remote  commands, simply follow these instructions:  1.  Log in to your PhoneGap Build account. Simply open your command line and run    this command: phonegap remote login  2.  You will be prompted to fill in your e-mail address and password. If you see the   following message, it means that you have successfully logged in: [phonegap] logged in as    3.  You don't need to add any platform to your project. To build your application, you have   to run this command in your project directory: phonegap remote build    4.  The preceding command is similar to the phonegap build   command.   Instead of using an SDK on your local machine, the project build takes place on the  PhoneGap Build server.  5.  You can run your application with the following command:  phonegap remote run    6.  You will notice something different from our previous phonegap run     command. The phonegap will not run your application directly, whether on your  device or on an emulator. It will generate a QR code for you. You can scan the QR  code with your phone, and it will download and install your application in your device.  Almost all phonegap commands can be replaced with cordova  commands; for example, phonegap build android can be replaced  with cordova build android. But the phonegap remote command  is available on  phonegap only. So you can't do something like cordova  remote build android. If you are confused between Cordova and PhoneGap, read about the history  of Cordova and PhoneGap at http:  phonegap.com 2012 03 19  phonegap-cordova-and-what%E2%80%99s-in-a-name .  14  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… When building a PhoneGap application, the first thing to do is create a new PhoneGap   project. PhoneGap will generate the project files automatically and give a starter application  as a sample. Then we add platforms that we want to work with. For a remote-based build,   we don't need to specify which platforms we want to work with. PhoneGap Build will prepare  our application to work with iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile.  The main difference between local-based builds and remote-based builds is where the  application building process is done. For local-based builds, PhoneGap will use the platform  SDK that is installed on your machine to build the application. If the SDK is not found,  PhoneGap will force you to use a remote-based build.  In the case of a remote-based build, your code will be uploaded to the PhoneGap Build server.  Then the PhoneGap Build server will build your application using its machine. We do not get  a device-specific project, such as an Android Eclipse project or iOS Xcode project, when using  remote-based builds. What we get is a distribution-ready binary. We will get *.ipa for an iOS  application and *.apk for an Android application.  Installing API plugins A plugin is a piece of add-on code that provides an interface for native components. A plugin  contains native code and a JavaScript interface. Using plugins, we can access native features  using JavaScript code. We can get access to a camera, a file browser, geolocation, and so on  by calling the PhoneGap JavaScript API.  How to do it… The PhoneGap CLI allows us to manage plugins easily from the command line. Adding new  plugins and removing existing plugins is easy now. We don't have to download and configure   a plugin for each platform that we are targeting. Prior to PhoneGap 3, plugin management  was a pain.  Adding plugins When creating a new PhoneGap project, PhoneGap doesn't include any plugins in the project.  It makes our initial application clean. First, we may want to build an application without native  capabilities, just like developing a web application. Then we can add plugins to extend the  application.  To add a plugin to an existing project, run the following command in your project directory:  phonegap plugin add    15  www.it-ebooks.info   The   argument can be the path to the plugin directory on a local machine, the  git repository, or the plugin namespace. The following commands can be used to add a  plugin from the various sources mentioned before:  phonegap plugin add  local path to plugin   phonegap plugin add http:  example.com path to plugin.git  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.device  Once a plugin has been successfully added to a project, the plugin APIs can be executed using  JavaScript. Each plugin has its own way of accessing native APIs, so read the documentation  for each plugin.  You can search for an existing plugin using the cordova  plugin search   command.  Listing plugins After installing plugins, you can list all the installed plugins by running the following command:  phonegap plugin list  You will see a list of plugins installed, like this:  Removing plugins To remove the installed plugins, simply run the following command from your project directory:  phonegap plugin remove    The   argument is the plugin id inside the plugin's plugin.xml file. The   argument is  also the name of the plugin directory inside the plugins  folder in your project. For example,  if we want to remove the org.apache.cordova.device plugin, we can run this command:  phonegap plugin remove org.apache.cordova.device  16  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… When the phonegap plugin add command is executed, phonegap will copy the plugin  files from the source to the project under the plugins  directory. Each plugin will have its  own directory, with the plugin ID as the directory name. Inside each plugin folder, you will  find the doc , src , tests , and www  directories, along with other files.  The doc  folder contains the plugin documentation. The src  folder contains native code   for each platform. You will see Java code for Android, Objective-C code for iOS, and so on.   The tests  folder contains JavaScript unit tests for the JavaScript interface. The last folder  is www . It contains markup, styling, media, and JavaScript code that is used for presentation  and to interface with native code. The main code of the PhoneGap application will be placed  in the www folder.  After the plugin is copied to the plugins directory, phonegap will update or create a .json  file inside plugins . Each platform will have its own .json file. Android will have android. json, while iOS will have ios.json. These .json files hold the plugin configuration for each  platform. The following is an example of the use of plugin configurations:   f Adding a new permission: Some plugins may need to add permissions to be able  to work properly. Here is an example of modifying AndroidManifest.xml for the  Android project. A new ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission is added so that we  can have access to the network state: "AndroidManifest.xml": {     "parents": {         " *": [             {                 "xml": "<uses-permission   android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"    >",                 "count": 1             }         ]     } }   f Modifying platform project files: Some plugins may need to add some configurations  to each platform project. The following is an example of a configuration for modifying  res xml config.xml in the Android project: "res xml config.xml": {     "parents": {         " *": [             {  17  www.it-ebooks.info                   "xml": "<feature   name=\"NetworkStatus\"><param name=\"android-package\"   value=\"org.apache.cordova.networkinformation .NetworkManager\"  > ",                 "count": 1             },             {                 "xml": "                  <param name=\"android-package\"                   value=\"org.apache.cordova.batterystatus                 .BatteryListener\"  > ",                 "count": 1             }         ]     } }   f Declaring which plugins are used and plugin dependency: The configuration also   holds information about which installed plugins are used for each platform: "installed_plugins": {     "org.apache.cordova.network-information": {         "PACKAGE_NAME": "com.myapp.hello"     },     "org.apache.cordova.battery-status": {         "PACKAGE_NAME": "com.myapp.hello"     } }, "dependent_plugins": {}  See also   f Chapter 2, Movement and Location – Using the Accelerometer and    Geolocation Sensors   f Chapter 3, Filesystems, Storage, and Local Databases  f Chapter 4, Working with Audio, Images, and Video  f Chapter 5, Working with Your Contacts List  f Chapter 6, Hooking into Native Events  f Chapter 11, Extending PhoneGap with Plugins  18  www.it-ebooks.info   2  Movement and  Location – Using the  Accelerometer and  Geolocation Sensors  In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:   f Detecting device movement using the accelerometer  f Adjusting the accelerometer sensor update interval  f Updating a display object position through accelerometer events  f Obtaining device geolocation sensor information  f Adjusting the geolocation sensor update interval  f Retrieving map data through geolocation coordinates  f Creating a visual compass to show the device direction  Introduction Mobile devices are incredibly powerful tools that not only allow us to make calls and send  messages, but also help us navigate and identify where we are in the world, thanks to the  accelerometer, geolocation, and other sensors.  This chapter will explore how we can access these sensors and make use of this exposed  functionality using plugins.  19  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting device movement using the  accelerometer The accelerometer captures device motion in the x, y, and z axis direction. The accelerometer  is a motion sensor that detects change  delta  in movement relative to the orientation of the  current device.  How to do it… We will use the accelerometer functionality from the plugins to monitor the feedback from   the device:  1.  First, create a new PhoneGap project named accelerometer. Open Terminal or   Command Prompt and run the following command: phonegap create accelerometer com.myapp.accelerometer  accelerometer  2.  Add the device's platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the device-motion plugin by running the following command: phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.device-motion  4.  Open www index.html and clean up unnecessary elements; so you have    the following:                             <meta name="format-detection"           content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"           content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,           initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,           width=device-width, height=device-height,           target-densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"           href="css index.css"  >          Hello World               20  www.it-ebooks.info            Accelerometer Data           Obtaining data…          <script type="text javascript"           src="cordova.js">                                5.  Below the Cordova JavaScript reference, write a new JavaScript tag block and define  an event listener to ensure that the device is ready and the native code has loaded  before continuing:            Set the event listener to run          when the device is ready       document.addEventListener 'deviceready',         onDeviceReady, false ;    6.  Now add in the onDeviceReady function, which will run the   getCurrentAcceleration method when the native code has fully loaded:    The device is ready so let's    obtain the current accelerometer data function onDeviceReady   {      navigator.accelerometer.getCurrentAcceleration       onSuccess, onError ; }  7.   Include the onSuccess function to handle the returned information from   the accelerometer.  8.  Define the accelerometer div element to the accElement variable to hold the   generated accelerometer results.  9.  Next, assign the returned values from the acceleration object as the HTML within   the accelerometer div element for display to the user; the available properties  are accessed through the acceleration object:    Run after successful transaction    Let's display the accelerometer data function onSuccess acceleration  {     var accElement =         document.getElementById 'accelerometerData' ;      accElement.innerHTML    =         'Acceleration X: ' + acceleration.x + ' ' +  21  www.it-ebooks.info         'Acceleration Y: ' + acceleration.y + ' ' +         'Acceleration Z: ' + acceleration.z + ' ' +         'Timestamp: '      + acceleration.timestamp; }  10.  Finally, include the onError function to deal with any possible issues:     Run if we face an error    obtaining the accelerometer data function onError error  {        Handle any errors we may face     alert 'error' ; }  11.  Build and run the project:  cordova build android  cordova run android  12. When running the application on an emulator, the output will look something like this:  How it works… By registering an event listener to the deviceready event, we are ensuring that the  JavaScript code does not run before the native PhoneGap code is executed. Once ready,   the application will call the getCurrentAcceleration method from the accelerometer   API, providing two methods to handle successful transactions and errors respectively.  22  www.it-ebooks.info   The onSuccess function returns the obtained acceleration information in the form of the  following four properties:   f acceleration.x: This is a Number registered in meters per second squared  m  s^2  that measures the device acceleration across the x axis. This is the movement  from left to right when the device is placed with the screen in an upright position.  Positive acceleration is obtained as the device is moved to the right, whereas a  negative movement is obtained when the device is moved to the left.   f acceleration.y: This is a Number registered in m s^2 that measures the device   acceleration across the y axis. This is the movement from bottom to top when the  device is placed with the screen facing an upright position. Positive acceleration is  obtained as the device is moved upwards, whereas a negative movement is obtained  when the device is moved downwards.   f acceleration.z: This is a Number registered in m s^2 that measures the device   acceleration across the z axis. This is perpendicular from the face of the device. Positive  acceleration is obtained when the device is moved to face towards the sky, whereas a  negative movement is obtained when the device is pointed towards the Earth.   f acceleration.timestamp: This is a DOMTimeStamp that measures the number  of milliseconds from the point of the application's initialization. This could be used to  store, update and track changes over a period of time since the last accelerometer  update.  The following diagram shows the X, Y, and Z axis in relation to the device:  23  www.it-ebooks.info   The acceleration.x, acceleration.y, and acceleration.z values returned from the  aforementioned acceleration object include the effect of gravity, which is defined as precisely  9.81 m s^2.  iOS doesn't know about the concept of getting current acceleration at  any given point. Device motion must be watched and the data captured  at a given time interval.  There's more... Accelerometer data obtained from devices has been used to great effect in mobile handset  games that require balance control and detection of movement, including steering, control  views, and tilting objects. You can check out the official Cordova documentation covering the  getCurrentAcceleration method and obtaining accelerometer data.  See also   f You can check out the official Cordova documentation covering the   getCurrentAcceleration method and obtaining accelerometer data at http:   plugins.cordova.io  package org.apache.cordova.device-motion.  Adjusting the accelerometer sensor update  interval The getCurrentAcceleration method obtains data from the accelerometer at the   time it was called - a single call to obtain a single response object. In this recipe, we'll   build an application that allows us to set an interval to obtain a constant update from   the accelerometer to detect continual movement from the device.  How to do it… We will provide additional parameters to a new method available through the PhoneGap API to  set the update interval:  1.  First, create a new PhoneGap project named accelupdate. Open Terminal or   Command Prompt and run the following command: phonegap create accelupdate com.myapp.accelupdate accelupate  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  24  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Add the device-motion plugin by running the following command: phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.device-motion  4.  Open www index.html and clean up unnecessary elements; so you have    the following:                             <meta name="format-detection"           content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"           content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,           initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,           width=device-width, height=device-height,         target-densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"           href="css index.css"  >          Hello World                       Accelerometer Data           Obtaining data…           <script type="text javascript"           src="cordova.js">                                5.  Below the Cordova JavaScript reference, write a new JavaScript tag block, within which   a variable called watchID will be declared.  6.  Next, define an event listener to ensure that the device is ready and the native code   has loaded before continuing:            The watch id variable is set as a          reference to the current 'watchAcceleration'       var watchID = null;          Set the event listener to run          when the device is ready  25  www.it-ebooks.info         document.addEventListener 'deviceready',         onDeviceReady, false ;    7.  Now add in the onDeviceReady function, which will run a method called   startWatch once the native code has fully loaded:    The device is ready so let's    start watching the acceleration  function onDeviceReady   {        startWatch  ; }  8.  Next, write the startWatch function. To do this, first, create a variable called   options to hold the optional frequency parameter, set to 3,000 milliseconds    3 seconds .  9.  Then, set the initial disabled properties of two buttons that will allow the user to   start and stop the acceleration detection.  10.  Next, assign the watchAcceleration to the previously defined watchID variable.   This will allow you to check for a value or identify if it is still set to null.  11.  Apart from defining the success and error function names, you are also sending the   options variable into the method call, which contains the frequency value:    Watch the acceleration at regular    intervals as set by the frequency function startWatch   {         Set the frequency of updates        from the acceleration     var options = { frequency: 3000 };         Set attributes for control buttons     document.getElementById 'startBtn' .disabled = true;     document.getElementById 'stopBtn' .disabled = false;         Assign watchAcceleration to the watchID variable        and pass through the options array     watchID = navigator.accelerometer.watchAcceleration      onSuccess, onError, options ; }  12.  With the startWatch function written, you now need to provide a method to stop the  detection of the acceleration. This firstly checks the value of the watchID variable. If  this is not null, it will stop watching the acceleration using the clearWatch method,  passing in the watchID parameter before resetting this variable back to null.  26  www.it-ebooks.info   13.  Then reference the accelerometer div element and set its value to a    user-friendly message.  14.  Next, reassign the disabled properties for both the control buttons to allow    the user to start watching again, as follows:    Stop watching the acceleration function stopWatch   {      if  watchID  {         navigator.accelerometer.clearWatch watchID ;       watchID = null;          var element =             document.getElementById 'accelerometerData' ;          element.innerHTML =             'No longer watching your acceleration.';             Set attributes for control buttons         document.getElementById 'startBtn' .disabled =           false;         document.getElementById 'stopBtn' .disabled = true;      } }  15.  Now, create the onSuccess method, which will be run after a successful update   response. Assign the returned values from the acceleration object as the HTML  within the accelerometer div element for display to the user—the available  properties are accessed through the acceleration object and applied to the   string variable:    Run after successful transaction    Let's display the accelerometer data function onSuccess acceleration  {     var element =       document.getElementById 'accelerometerData' ;     element.innerHTML =         'Acceleration X: ' + acceleration.x + ' ' +         'Acceleration Y: ' + acceleration.y + ' ' +       'Acceleration Z: ' + acceleration.z + ' ' +       'Timestamp: '      + acceleration.timestamp +       ' '; }  27  www.it-ebooks.info   16.  You also need to supply the onError method to catch any possible issues with  the request. Here, output a user-friendly message, setting it as the value of the  accelerometerData div element:    Run if we face an error    obtaining the accelerometer data function onError   {        Handle any errors we may face     var element =       document.getElementById 'accelerometerData' ;     element.innerHTML =         'Sorry, I was unable to access the acceleration           data.'; }  17.  Finally, add in the two button elements, both of which will have an onClick    attribute set to either start or stop watching the device acceleration:        Accelerometer Data       <button id="startBtn"       onclick="startWatch  ">start       <button id="stopBtn"       onclick="stopWatch  ">stop        Obtaining data...      18.  The results will appear similar to the following screenshot:  28  www.it-ebooks.info   19.  Stopping the acceleration watch will result something like this:  How it works… By registering an event listener to the deviceready event, we ensure that the JavaScript  code does not run before the native PhoneGap code is executed. Once ready, the application  calls the startWatch function, within which the desired frequency interval for the  acceleration updates is set.  The watchAcceleration method from the PhoneGap API retrieves the device's   current acceleration data at the specified interval. If not, as the interval is passed through,   it defaults to 10,000 milliseconds  10 seconds . Each time an update has been obtained,   the onSuccess method is run to handle the data as you wish—in this case, displaying the  results on the screen.  The watchID variable contains a reference to the watch interval and is used to stop the  watching process by passing it into the clearWatch method from the PhoneGap API.  There's more… In this example, the frequency value for the accelerometer update interval was set at 3,000  milliseconds  3 seconds . Consider writing a variation on this application that allows the user  to manually change the interval value using a slider, or by setting the desired value into an  input box.  See also…   f You can check out the official Cordova documentation covering the   watchAcceleration method and specifying how to obtain accelerometer   data at http:  plugins.cordova.io  package org.apache.cordova. device-motion.  29  www.it-ebooks.info   Updating a display object position through  accelerometer events Developers can make use of the accelerometer sensor and continual updates provided by it  for many purposes, including motion-detection games and updating the position of an object  on the screen.  How to do it… We will use the device's accelerometer sensor on continual update to move an element  around the screen as a response to device movement:  1.  First, create a new PhoneGap project named accelobject by running the    following command: phonegap create accelobject com.myapp.accelobject accelobject  2.  Add the device platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the device motion plugin by running the following command:  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.device-motion  4.  Open www index.html and clean up unnecessary elements. Within the body tag  create two div elements. Set the first with the id attribute equal to dot. This will be  the element that will move around the screen of the device.  5.  The second div element will have the id of accelerometerData and will be the   container into which the returned acceleration data will be output:                           <meta name="format-detection"           content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"           content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,           initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,           width=device-width, height=device-height,         target-densitydpi=device-dpi"  >          Hello World         30  www.it-ebooks.info            Obtaining data...                  Accelerometer Movement                       <script type="text javascript"           src="js index.js">                                6.  You can now start with the custom scripting and PhoneGap implementation. Add a   script tag block before the closing head tag to house the code:  7.  Before diving into the core code, you need to declare some variables. Here, set a   default value for watchID as well as the radius for the circle display object you will  be moving around the screen:    The watch id variable is set as a    reference to the current `watchAcceleration` var watchID = null;     The radius for our circle object var radius  = 50;  8.  Now declare the event listener for the deviceready event, as well as the  onDeviceReady function, which will run once the native PhoneGap code   has been loaded:    Set the event listener to run when the device is ready document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   false ;     The device is ready so let's    start watching the acceleration function onDeviceReady   {      startWatch  ;  }  31  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  The onDeviceReady function will execute the startWatch method, which sets the  required frequency for accelerometer updates and makes the request to the device  to obtain the information:    Watch the acceleration at regular    intervals as set by the frequency function startWatch   {         Set the frequency of updates from the acceleration    var options = { frequency: 100 };         Assign watchAcceleration to the watchID variable        and pass through the options array     watchID =         navigator.accelerometer.watchAcceleration              onSuccess, onError, options ; }  10.  With the request made to the device, it is time to create the success and error  handling methods. The onSuccess function is first, and this will deal with the  movement of our object around the screen.  11.  To begin, you need to declare some variables that manage the positioning of the   element on the device: function onSuccess acceleration  {         Initial X Y positions     var x = 0;     var y = 0;         Velocity   Speed     var vx = 0;     var vy = 0;         Acceleration     var accelX = 0;     var accelY = 0;         Multiplier to create proper pixel measurements     var vMultiplier =   100;         Create a reference to our div elements     var dot = document.getElementById 'dot' ;     var accelElement =     document.getElementById 'accelerometerData' ;  32  www.it-ebooks.info          The rest of the code will go here  }  12. The returned acceleration object contains the information you need regarding the   position on the x and y axis of the device. You can now set the acceleration values  for these two axes in the variables and work out the velocity for movement.  13.  To correctly interpret the acceleration results into pixels, use the vMultiplier   variable to convert x and y into pixels: accelX = acceleration.x; accelY = acceleration.y;  vy = vy + - accelY ; vx = vx + accelX;  y = parseInt y + vy * vMultiplier ; x = parseInt x + vx * vMultiplier ;  bounds of the screen: if  x<0  { x = 0; vx = 0; } if  y<0  { y = 0; vy = 0; }  14.  Ensure that the display object doesn't move out of sight and remains within the   if  x>document.documentElement.clientWidth-radius  {   x = document.documentElement.clientWidth-radius; vx = 0; }  if  y>document.documentElement.clientHeight-radius  {    y = document.documentElement.clientHeight-radius; vy = 0; }  15.  Now that you have the correct x and y coordinates, you can apply them to the style  of the dot element position. Also create a string message containing the properties  returned from the acceleration object as well as the display coordinates that have  been created:    Apply the position to the dot element dot.style.top  = y + "px"; dot.style.left = x + "px";     Output the acceleration results to the screen accelElement.innerHTML =   'Acceleration X: '  + acceleration.x + ' ' +   'Acceleration Y: '  + acceleration.y + ' ' +   'Acceleration Z: '   + acceleration.z + ' ' +  33  www.it-ebooks.info     'Timestamp: '        + acceleration.timestamp +   ' ' +     'Move Top: '            + y + 'px ' +     'Move Left: '           + x + 'px';  16.  The call to the accelerometer also requires the error handler, so let's write that now.  Create a simple string message and insert it into the div element to inform the user  that a problem has been encountered:    Run if we face an error    obtaining the accelerometer data function onError   {  17.  Finally, add in some CSS to create the dot marker used to display the position on the          Handle any errors we may face     var accelElement =             document.getElementById 'accelerometerData' ;      accelElement.innerHTML =         'Sorry, I was unable to access the acceleration           data.'; }  device. Place the following CSS within the style tag in the head element:         divdot {     border-radius: 14px;     width: 25px;     height: 25px;     background: ff0000;     position: absolute;     top: 0px;     left: 0px;   }      34  www.it-ebooks.info   18.  Upon running the application, you will be able to move the element around the screen   by tilting the device. This would look something like this:  How it works… By implementing a constant request to watch the acceleration and retrieve movement results  from the device, we can pick up changes from the accelerometer sensor. Through some  simple JavaScript, we can respond to these changes and update the position of an element  around the screen based upon the returned sensor information.  In this recipe, we are easily changing the position of the dot element by calculating the  correct x and y axis to place it on the screen. We are also taking extra care to ensure that   the element stays within the bounds of the screen by using some conditional statements to  check the current position, the radius of the element, and the dimensions of the screen itself.  Obtaining device geolocation sensor  information Geolocation and the use of Global Positioning System  GPS  allow developers to create  dynamic real-time mapping, positioning, and tracking applications. Using the available  geolocation methods, we can retrieve a detailed set of information and properties to create  location-aware applications. We can obtain the user's location via the mobile data network,  Wi-Fi, or directly from the satellite.  35  www.it-ebooks.info   How to do it… We will use the geolocation functionality from the geolocation plugin's API to monitor the  feedback from the device and obtain the relevant location information, as follows:  1.  First, create a new PhoneGap project named geolocation. Open Terminal or   Command Prompt and run following command: phonegap create geolocation com.myapp.geolocation geolocation  2.  Add the device platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the geolocation plugin by running the following command:  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.geolocation  4.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements; so you have    the following:                             <meta name="format-detection"           content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"           content="no"  >         <!-- WARNING: for iOS 7, remove the     width=device-width and height=device-height attributes.

Write a new JavaScript tag block beneath the Cordova JavaScript reference. Within   this, define an event listener to ensure the device is ready:          Set the event listener to run when the device is       ready     document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,       false ;    6.  Now add the onDeviceReady function. This will execute the geolocation. getCurrentPosition method from the PhoneGap API once the native code   has fully loaded:    The device is ready so let's    obtain the current geolocation data function onDeviceReady   {     navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition      onSuccess, onError ; }  7.   Include the onSuccess function to handle the returned the position object from  the geolocation request.  8.  Then, create a reference to the geolocationData div element and assign it to the   geoElement variable, which will hold the generated position results.  9.  Next, assign the returned values as a formatted string, which will be set as the HTML   content within the geolocationData div element. The available properties are  accessed through the position object:    Run after successful transaction    Let's display the position data function onSuccess position  {      var geoElement =       document.getElementById 'geolocationData' ;      geoElement .innerHTML =        'Latitude: '  + position.coords.latitude + ' ' +      'Longitude: ' + position.coords.longitude + ' ' +      'Altitude: '  + position.coords.altitude + ' ' +      'Accuracy: '  + position.coords.accuracy + ' ' +      'Altitude Accuracy: ' +        position.coords.altitudeAccuracy + ' ' +  37  www.it-ebooks.info        'Heading: ' + position.coords.heading  + ' ' +      'Speed: '   + position.coords.speed + ' ' +      'Timestamp: ' + position.timestamp + ' '; }  10.  Finally, include the onError function to handle any possible errors that may arise. 11.  Depending on the existence of an error, use the value of the returned error code to   determine which message to display to the user. This will be set as the HTML content  of the geolocationData div element:    Run if we face an error    obtaining the position data function onError error  {      var errString   =   '';         Check to see if we have received an error code     if error.code  {             If we have, handle it by case         switch error.code          {             case 1:    PERMISSION_DENIED             errString   =             'Unable to obtain the location information ' +             'because the device does not have permission '+                     'to the use that service.';             break;             case 2:    POSITION_UNAVAILABLE                 errString   =                  'Unable to obtain the location                    information ' +                  'because the device location could not ' +                  'be determined.';             break;             case 3:    TIMEOUT                 errString   =               'Unable to obtain the location within the ' +                     'specified time allocation.';             break;             default:    UNKOWN_ERROR                 errString   =                   'Unable to obtain the location of the ' +                     'device due to an unknown error.';  38  www.it-ebooks.info               break;         }      }         Handle any errors we may face     var element =       document.getElementById 'geolocationData' ;     element.innerHTML = errString;  }  12. When running the application on a device, the output will look something like this:  13.  If you face any errors, the resulting output will look something like this:  39  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… As soon as the device is ready and the native PhoneGap code has been initiated on  the device, the application will execute the getCurrentPosition method from the  geolocation API. We have defined an onSuccess method to manage the output and  handling of a successful response, and we have also specified an onError method to   catch any errors and act accordingly.  The onSuccess method returns the obtained geolocation information in the form of the  position object, which contains the following properties:   f position.coords.speed: This is a Coordinates object that holds the  geographic information returned from the request. This object contains the   following properties:                       latitude: This is a Number ranging from -90.00 to +90.00 that specifies  the latitude estimate in decimal degrees. longitude: This is a Number ranging from -180.00 to +180.00 that  specifies the longitude estimate in decimal degrees. altitude: This is a Number that specifies the altitude estimate in meters  above the World Geodetic System  WGS  84 ellipsoid. Optional. accuracy: This Number specifies the accuracy of the latitude and longitude  in meters. Optional. altitudeAccuracy: This is a Number that specifies the accuracy of the  altitude estimate in meters. Optional. heading: This is a Number that specifies the current direction of movement  in degrees, counting clockwise in relation to true north. Optional. speed: This Number specifies the current ground speed of the device in  meters per second. Optional.   f position.timestamp: A DOMTimeStamp that signifies the time that the   geolocation information was received and the position object was created.  The properties available within the position object are quite comprehensive and detailed.  For those marked as optional, the value will be set and returned as null if the device cannot  provide a value.  The onError method returns a PositionError object if an error is detected during the  request. This object contains the following two properties:   f code: This is a Number that contains a numeric code for the error.  f message: This is a String that contains a human readable description of the error.  40  www.it-ebooks.info   The errors could relate to insufficient permissions needed to access the geolocation sensors  on the device, the inability to locate the device due to issues with obtaining the necessary  GPS information, a timeout on the request, or the occurrence of an unknown error.  There's more... The exposed geolocation API accessible through the geolocation plugin is based on the W3C  geolocation API specification. Many modern browsers and devices already have this functionality  enabled. If any device your application runs on already implements this specification, it will use  the built-in support for the API and not the geolocation plugin's implementation.  See also   f You can find out more about geolocation and the getCurrentPosition method via  the official Cordova documentation available at http:  plugins.cordova.io   package org.apache.cordova.geolocation.  Adjusting the geolocation sensor update  interval Through the use of the getCurrentPosition method, we can retrieve a single reference to  the device location using GPS coordinates. In this recipe, we'll create the functionality to obtain  the current location based on a numeric interval to receive constantly updated information.  How to do it… We are able to pass through an optional parameter containing various arguments to set up  interval and improve accuracy:  1.  First, create a new PhoneGap project named geoupdate by running the    following command: phonegap create geoupdate com.myapp.geoupdate geoupdate  2.  Add the device platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the geolocation plugin by running the following command: phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.geolocation  41  www.it-ebooks.info   4.  Open www index.html and clean up unnecessary elements; so you have    the following:                             <meta name="format-detection"           content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"           content="no"  >         <!-- WARNING: for iOS 7, remove the width=device-width and height=device-height attributes.

Below the Cordova JavaScript reference, write a new JavaScript tag block.    Within this, declare a new variable called watchID.  6.  Next, write the event listener to continue once the device is ready:           The watch id variable is set as a        reference to the current 'watchPosition'     var watchID = null;        Set the event listener to run        when the device is ready     document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,       false ;    42  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  Now add the onDeviceReady function, which will execute a method called   startWatch:    The device is ready so let's    start watching the position function onDeviceReady   {     startWatch  ; }  8.  You can now create the startWatch function. First, create the options variable   to hold the optional parameters that can be passed through to the method. Set  frequency to 5,000 milliseconds  five seconds  and set enableHighAccuracy   to true.  9.  Next, assign the watchPosition to the previously defined variable watchID.    This variable will be used to check if the location is currently being watched.  10.  To pass through the extra parameters that have been set, send the options    variable into the watchPosition method: function startWatch   {         Create the options to send through     var options = {             enableHighAccuracy: true     };         Watch the position and update        when a change has been detected     watchID =   navigator.geolocation.watchPosition onSuccess, onError,   options ;  }  11.  With the initial call methods created, you can now write the onSuccess function,   which is executed after a successful response. The position object from the  response is sent through as an argument to the function.  12. Declare some variables to store detailed information obtained from the response  in the form of the timestamp, latitude, longitude, and accuracy variables.  Then, create the element variable to reference the geolocationData div element,  within which the information will be displayed.  13.  The returned information is then assigned to the relevant variables by accessing the   properties from the position object.  43  www.it-ebooks.info   14.  Finally, apply the populated variables to a concatenated string and set it as the HTML   15.  With the onSuccess method created, now write the onError function to handle any   within the div element:    Run after successful transaction    Let's display the position data function onSuccess position  {      var timestamp, latitude, longitude, accuracy;      var element =   document.getElementById 'geolocationData' ;      timestamp   =   new Date position.timestamp ;     latitude    =   position.coords.latitude;     longitude   =   position.coords.longitude;     accuracy        =   position.coords.accuracy;      element.innerHTML +=             ' ' +             'Timestamp: '   + timestamp + ' ' +             'Latitude: '    + latitude  + ' ' +             'Longitude: '   + longitude + ' ' +             'Accuracy: '    + accuracy  + ' '; }  errors that you may face following the response:    Run if we face an error    obtaining the position data function onError error  {      var errString   =   '';         Check to see if we have received an error code     if error.code  {            If we have, handle it by case         switch error.code          {             case 1:    PERMISSION_DENIED                 errString   =             'Unable to obtain the location information ' +             'because the device does not have permission '+             'to the use that service.';             break;             case 2:    POSITION_UNAVAILABLE                 errString   =              'Unable to obtain the location information ' +              'because the device location could not be ' +              'determined.';             break;  44  www.it-ebooks.info               case 3:    TIMEOUT                 errString   =               'Unable to obtain the location within the ' +                     'specified time allocation.';             break;             default:    UNKOWN_ERROR                 errString   =                 'Unable to obtain the location of the ' +                 'device to an unknown error.';             break;         }      }  }         Handle any errors we may face     var element =       document.getElementById 'geolocationData' ;     element.innerHTML = errString;  16.  Upon running the application, the output will be similar to the following:  45  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… The watchPosition method from the PhoneGap API runs as an asynchronous function,  constantly checking for changes to the device's current position. Once a change in position  has been detected, it will return the current geographic location information in the form of   the position object.  With every successful request made on the continuous cycle, the onSuccess method is  executed, and it formats the data for output onto the screen.  There's more… There are three optional parameters that can be sent into either the getCurrentPosition  or watchPosition methods, which are:   f enableHighAccuracy: This is a Boolean that specifies whether or not you would  like to obtain the best possible location results from the request. By default  false ,  the position will be retrieved using the mobile or cell network. If set to true, more  accurate methods will be used to locate the device, using satellite positioning, for  example.   f timeout: This is a Number that defines the maximum length of time in milliseconds   to obtain the successful response.   f maximumAge: This is a Number that defines if a coached position younger than the   specified time in milliseconds can be used.  Android devices will not return a successful geolocation result  unless enableHighAccuracy is set to true.  Clearing the interval To clear interval timer we can use the clearWatch method from the geolocation plugin API.  The method to clear the interval and stop watching location data is identical to the method  used when clearing accelerometer data obtained from continual updates.  Retrieving map data through geolocation  coordinates In this recipe, we will examine how to render a map on the screen and generate a marker  based on latitude and longitude coordinates reported by the device geolocation sensors   using the Google Maps API for JavaScript.  46  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting ready Before we can continue with coding the application in this recipe, we must first prepare the  project and obtain access to the Google Maps services:  1.  First, sign up for a Google Maps API key. Visit https:  code.google.com   apis console  and log in with your Google account.  2.  Select APIs & auth followed by APIs from the left-hand side menu and activate the   Google Maps JavaScript API v3 service.  3.  Once the service has been activated, you must create a new credential. Go to APIs  & auth  Credentials, and under Public API access select Create new Key. Select  Server key and hit Create. A new key will be created for any IPS.  We can now proceed with the recipe.  https:  developers.google.com maps  documentation javascript .  47  www.it-ebooks.info   How to do it… We'll use the device's GPS ability to obtain the geolocation coordinates, build and initialize the  map canvas, and display the marker for our current position as follows:  1.  First, create a new PhoneGap project named maps by running the following command:  phonegap create maps com.myapp.maps maps  2.  Add the device platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the geolocation plugin by running the following command:  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.geolocation  4.  Open www index.html and clean up unnecessary elements; so you have    the following:                             <meta name="format-detection"           content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"           content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,           initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,           width=device-width, height=device-height,         target-densitydpi=device-dpi"  >          You are here                       <script type="text javascript"           src="cordova.js">                           Custom code goes here                    48  www.it-ebooks.info   5.   Include the required JavaScript for the Google Maps API under the Cordova reference.  Append your API key to the query string in the script src attribute: <script type="text javascript" src="http:  maps.googleapis.com  maps api js?key=your_api_key&sensor=true">    When we included the Google Maps API JavaScript into our document,   we set the sensor query parameter to true. If we were only allowing the  user to manually input coordinates without automatic detection, this could  have been set to false. However, we are using the data obtained from  the device's sensor to automatically retrieve our location.  6.  Start creating the custom code within the JavaScript tag block. First, create the event  listener to ensure the device is ready and also create the onDeviceReady method,  which will run using the listener:    Set the event listener to run when the device is ready document.addEventListener  "deviceready", onDeviceReady, false ;     The device is ready, so let's    obtain the current geolocation data function onDeviceReady   {     navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition          onSuccess,         onError      ; }  7.  Next, write the onSuccess method, which will give you access to the returned   location data via the position object.  8.  Take the latitude and longitude information obtained from the device   geolocation sensor response and create a latLng object to be sent into the   Map when the component is initialized.  9.  Then set the options for the Map, setting its center to the coordinates set into the  latLng variable. Not all of the Google Maps controls translate well to the small  screen, especially in terms of usability. You can define which controls you would   like to use. In this case, accept zoomControl but not panControl.  10.  To define the Map itself, reference a div element and pass it through the   mapOptions previously declared.  49  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  To close this method, create a Marker to display at the exact location as set in the   latLng variable:    Run after successful transaction    Let's display the position data function onSuccess position  {      var latLng  =             new google.maps.LatLng                      position.coords.latitude,                     position.coords.longitude ;      var mapOptions = {                 center: latLng,                 panControl: false,                 zoomControl: true,                 zoom: 16,                 mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP             };      var map = new google.maps.Map                  document.getElementById 'map_holder' ,                             mapOptions                          ;                          var marker = new google.maps.Marker {                 position: latLng,                 map: map             } ;  12. To ensure that you correctly handle any errors that may occur, include the onError  function, which will display the specific string message according to the error within   a div element:    Run if we face an error    obtaining the position data function onError error  {      var errString   =   '';         Check to see if we have received an error code     if error.code  {            If we have, handle it by case  }  50  www.it-ebooks.info           switch error.code          {             case 1:    PERMISSION_DENIED                 errString   =                     'Unable to obtain the location   information ' +                     'because the device does not have   permission '+                     'to the use that service.';             break;             case 2:    POSITION_UNAVAILABLE                 errString   =                     'Unable to obtain the location   information ' +                     'because the device location could not   be ' +                     'determined.';             break;             case 3:    TIMEOUT                 errString   =                     'Unable to obtain the location within   the ' +                     'specified time allocation.';             break;             default:    UNKOWN_ERROR                 errString   =                     'Unable to obtain the location of the '   +                     'device due to an unknown error.';             break;         }      }         Handle any errors we may face     var element = document.getElementById 'map_holder' ;     element.innerHTML = errString; }  13.  With the body tag, include the div element into which the map will be displayed:              51  www.it-ebooks.info   14.  Finally, add a style block within the head tag to supply some essential formatting to   the page and the map element:       html { height: 100% }     body { height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0 }     map_holder { height: 100%; width: 100%; }    15.  Upon running the application on the device, you will see a result similar to    the following:  How it works... Thanks to the use of exposed mapping services such as Google Maps, we are able to perform  geolocation updates from the device and use the obtained data to create rich, interactive  visual mapping applications.  In this example, we centered the Map using the device coordinates and also created a Marker  overlay to place upon the mark for easy visual reference.  52  www.it-ebooks.info   The available APIs for mapping services such as this are incredibly detailed and contain many  functions and methods to assist you in creating your location-based tools and applications.  Some services also set limits on the number of requests made to the API, so make sure you  are aware of any restrictions in place.  Static maps In this recipe, we used the dynamic Google Maps API. We did this so that we could use the  zoom controls and provide our user with a certain level of interaction by being able to drag   the map. As an alternative, you could use the Google Static Maps service, which simplifies   the code needed to generate a map and will return a static image showing the location.  You can choose to use an API key with this service, but it is not required. You will still have   to enable the API in the same way the API access was enabled at the start of this recipe.  Consider the following code. It is an amendment to the onSuccess method, which runs   after the geolocation data has been obtained:     Run after successful transaction    Let's display the position data function onSuccess position  {     var mapOutput = '<img   src="http:  maps.googleapis.com maps api staticmap?center='+position. coords.latitude+','+position.coords.longitude+'&zoom=12&size=300x300&s cale=2&sensor=true">';     var element = document.getElementById 'map_holder' ;     element.innerHTML = mapOutput; }  Here, instead of creating the coordinates, the map, and the markers as in the earlier code  listing, we simply request an image source using the Static Maps API, and send in the  coordinates, image size, and other data as parameters.  By using the Static Maps API, you lose the interactivity offered through the dynamic map,   but you gain an incredibly simple, easy-to-use service that requires very little code to   achieve results.  There's more… We used the Google Maps API for JavaScript in this recipe. There are variations in the API level  offered by Google, and other mapping systems are also available through other providers, such  as MapQuest, MultiMap, and Yahoo! Maps. Explore the alternatives and experiment to see if a  particular solution suits your application better than others.  53  www.it-ebooks.info   See also   f You can find out more about the Google Maps API from the official documentation at   https:  developers.google.com maps documentation javascript .   f You can also find out more about the Google Static Maps API on the official  documentation, available at https:  developers.google.com maps  documentation staticmaps .  Creating a visual compass to show the  device direction The geolocation and accelerometer plugins' API provides developers with the ability to receive  coordinate and heading information from the device. We can use this information to build a  custom compass tool that responds to the device movement.  How to do it…  1.  First, create a new PhoneGap project named compass by running the    following command: phonegap create compass com.myapp.compass compass  2.  Add the device platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the device-orientation, device-motion, and geolocation plugins    by running the following command: phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.device-motion  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.geolocation  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.device-orientation  4.  Open www index.html and clean up unnecessary elements; so you have the   following:                             <meta name="format-detection"           content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"           content="no"  >  54  www.it-ebooks.info           <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,           initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >          Compass                       <script type="text javascript"           src="cordova.js">                           further code will be here                    5.   In this example, certain elements within the DOM will be referenced by class   name. For this, the XUI JavaScript library  http:  xuijs.com   will be used.   Add the script reference under the cordova reference:        6.  Add a new div element within the body tag and give this the class attribute of   container. This will hold the compass elements for display.  7.  The compass itself will be made up of two images. Both images will have an   individual class name assigned to them, which will allow you to easily reference  each of them within the JavaScript. Add these two within the container element.  8.  Next, write a new div element below the images with the id attribute set to   heading. This will hold the text output from the compass response:                      <img src="images rose.png" class="rose"   width="120" height="121" alt="rose"  >              <img src="images compass.png" class="compass"   width="200" height="200" alt="compass"  >                     55  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  With the initial layout complete, start writing the custom JavaScript code. First, define  the deviceready event listener—as XUI is being used, this differs a little from other  recipes within this chapter: var headingDiv; x$ document .on "deviceready", function    { } ;  10.  When you have a result to output to the user of the application, you want the data to be  inserted into the div tag with the heading id attribute. XUI makes this a simple task;  so update the headingDiv global variable to store this reference: x$ document .on "deviceready", function    {     headingDiv = x$ "heading" ; } ;  11.  Now include the requests to the PhoneGap compass methods. We'll actually    call two within the same function. First, obtain the current heading of the device   for instant data, and then make a request through to watch the device heading,  making the request every tenth of a second by using the frequency parameter;   this will provide continual updates to ensure the compass is correct: navigator.compass.getCurrentHeading onSuccess, onError ; navigator.compass.watchHeading onSuccess, onError,   {frequency: 100} ;  12.  Both of these requests use the same onSuccess and onError method to handle   output and data management. The onSuccess method will provide the returned data  in the form of a heading object.  13.  You can use this returned data to set the HTML content of the heading element with   the generated message string, using the headingDiv variable defined earlier.  14.  The visual compass also needs to respond to the heading information. Using XUI's  CSS method, you can alter the transform properties of the rose image to rotate  using the returned magneticHeading property. Here, reference the image by  calling its individual class name, .rose:    Run after successful transaction    Let's display the compass data function onSuccess heading  {     headingDiv.html          'Heading: ' + heading.magneticHeading + '&xb0; ' +         convertToText heading.magneticHeading  + ' ' +         'True Heading: ' + heading.trueHeading + ' ' +         'Accuracy: ' + heading.headingAccuracy      ;  56  www.it-ebooks.info          Alter the CSS properties to rotate the rose image     x$ ".rose" .css {         "-webkit-transform":         "rotate -" + heading.magneticHeading + "deg ",        "transform":         "rotate -" + heading.magneticHeading + "deg "     } ;  }  15.  With the onSuccess handler in place, you now need to add the onError method   to output a user-friendly message should you encounter any problems obtaining  information:    Run if we face an error    obtaining the compass data function onError   {     headingDiv.html          'There was an error trying to ' +         'locate your current bearing.'      ; }  16.  When creating the message string in the onSuccess function, you made a call to a  new function called convertToText. This accepts the magneticHeading value  from the heading object and converts it into a text representation of the direction   for display. Include this function outside the XUI deviceready block:    Accept the magneticHeading value    and convert into a text representation function convertToText mh  {     var textDirection;     if  typeof mh !== "number"  {         textDirection = '';      } else if  mh >= 337.5   mh >= 0 &&  mh <= 22.5   {         textDirection =  'N';     } else if  mh >= 22.5 && mh <= 67.5  {        textDirection =  'NE';     } else if  mh >= 67.5 && mh <= 112.5  {        textDirection =  'E';     } else if  mh >= 112.5 && mh <= 157.5  {        textDirection =  'SE';     } else if  mh >= 157.5 && mh <= 202.5  {        textDirection =  'S';     } else if  mh >= 202.5 && mh <= 247.5  {        textDirection =  'SW';  57  www.it-ebooks.info       } else if  mh >= 247.5 && mh <= 292.5  {        textDirection =  'W';     } else if  mh >= 292.5 && mh <= 337.5  {        textDirection =  'NW';     } else {         textDirection =  textDirection;     }     return textDirection; }  17.  Now provide some CSS to position the two images on the screen and ensure   the rose image is overlaying the compass image. Add a new   tag in     before the   tag:       .container {         position: relative;         margin: 0 auto;         width: 200px;         overflow: hidden;     }      heading {         position: relative;         font-size: 24px;         font-weight: 200;         text-shadow: 0 -1px 0 eee;         margin: 20px auto 20px auto;         color: 111;         text-align: center;     }     .compass {         padding-top: 12px;     }     .rose {         position: absolute;         top: 53px;         left: 40px;         width: 120px;         height: 121px;     }    Compass   58  www.it-ebooks.info   18.  Upon running the application on the device, the output will look something like this:  How it works… The watchHeading method from the PhoneGap API compass functionality retrieves periodic  updates containing the current heading of the device at the interval specified as the value  of the frequency variable passed through. If no interval is declared, a default value of 100  milliseconds  one-tenth of a second  is used.  With every successful request made on the continuous cycle, the onSuccess method is  executed, and it formats the data for output onto the screen as well as making a change to   the transform property of the graphical element to rotate in accordance with the heading.  The onSuccess method returns the obtained heading information in the form of the  compassHeading object, which contains the following properties:   f magneticHeading: This is a Number ranging from 0 to 359.99 that specifies a   heading in degrees at a single moment in time.   f trueHeading: This Number ranges from 0 to 359.99 and specifies the heading   relative to the geographic North Pole in degrees.   f headingAccuracy: This is a Number that indicates any deviation in degrees   between the reported heading and the true heading values.   f timestamp: This refers to the time in milliseconds at which the heading    was determined.  59  www.it-ebooks.info   See also   f Chapter 7, Working with XUI  60  www.it-ebooks.info   3  Filesystems, Storage,  and Local Databases  In this chapter, we will cover these recipes:   f Saving a file in the device storage  f Opening a local file from the device storage  f Displaying the contents of a directory  f Creating a local SQLite database  f Uploading a file on a remote server via a POST request  f Caching content using the local storage API  Introduction With the ever-increasing storage capacities on offer with each mobile device, whether the  storage is built-in or available as an expansion through a card, developers have the ability to  interact with and manipulate files stored on the device as well as utilize the API functionality   to cache content.  This chapter will explore how we can save and open individual files on the device's local  filesystem, create and manage local SQLite databases, upload a local file on a remote server,  and cache content using the local storage API.  www.it-ebooks.info   Saving a file in the device storage Thanks to the ability to traverse, read, and write to the device filesystem, an application can  write a file to either a specific, predefined location or a location chosen by the user within   the application.  How to do it... We will allow the user to enter a remote URL for a file in a textbox to download and save that  file in their mobile device:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named storage by running the following line:  phonegap create storage com.myapp.storage storage  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios cordova platform add android  3.  Add the file and file-transfer plugins by running this line:  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.file phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.file-transfer  4.  We're going to use the XUI JavaScript library to easily access the DOM elements,    so we'll include the reference to the file within the head tag.  5.  Let's open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements, so we will   have this:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"   href="css index.css"  >          Storage          <script type="text javascript"   src="js xui.js">   62  www.it-ebooks.info                        <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                       further code goes here                    6.  Within the body tag, create two input elements. Set the first element's type   attribute to text and the id attribute to file_url.  7.  Set the second input element's type attribute to button, the id attribute to   download_btn, and value to equal Download.  8.  Finally, include a new div element and set the id attribute to message. This will    be the container in which our returned output will be displayed:             <input type="button" id="download_btn" value="Download"    >             <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">     9.  Within the empty JavaScript tag block, we need to define a global variable called   downloadDirectory. It will reference the location on the device to store the  retrieved file. We'll also add in our event listener for our application, which will   run once the native PhoneGap code has been loaded: var downloadDirectory; document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   true ;  10.  We can now write our onDeviceReady function. The first thing that we need to   do is access the root filesystem on the device. Here, we are requesting access  to the persistent filesystem. Once a reference has been established, we run the  onFileSystemSuccess method to continue.  11.  We then bind a click function to the download_btn element using XUI,    which will run the download function when clicked on: function onDeviceReady   {     window.requestFileSystem   63  www.it-ebooks.info           LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT,         0,         onFileSystemSuccess,         null      ;      x$ 'download_btn' .on  'click', function e  {         download  ;     } ; }  12. With the connection made to the device storage, we can reference the root    system using the fileSystem object provided by PhoneGap. Here, we then call   the getDirectory method, providing the name of the directory to gain access to.  If it doesn't exist, it will be created for us. After a successful response, the returned  DirectoryEntry object is assigned to the downloadDirectory variable that  we set earlier: function onFileSystemSuccess fileSystem  {     fileSystem.root.getDirectory 'my_downloads',        {create:true},             function dir  {                 downloadDirectory = dir;             },fail ; }  13.  Our download function will be run when the user clicks on the Download button.  Firstly, we need to obtain the URL provided by the user from the text input box. We  can pass that value through to a new custom method called getFileName, which  will split the string and return the filename and extension for use later in the function.  We can now set a user-friendly message in the message container to inform them of  our progress.  14.  Next, we instantiate a new FileTransfer object from the File-Transfer plugin   API to assist us in downloading the remote object. The download method accepts  the remote URL to download, the directory on the device to save the file in, and the  success and error callback functions. After a successful operation, we will inform  the user of the local path where the file was saved: function download   {     var fileURL =   document.getElementById 'file_url' .value;     var localFileName = getFilename fileURL ;      x$ 'message' .html 'Downloading ' + localFileName ;  64  www.it-ebooks.info       var fileTransfer = new FileTransfer  ;     fileTransfer.download          fileURL,         downloadDirectory.fullPath + ' ' + localFileName,         function entry {             x$ 'message' .html 'Download complete. File   saved to: ' + entry.fullPath ;         },         function error {             alert "Download error source " +   JSON.stringify error  ;         }      ; }  15.  We include the custom function to obtain the name and extension of the remote file:  function getFilename url  {     if  url  {        var m = url.toString  .match  .*\  .+? \.  ;         if  m && m.length > 1  {             return m[1] + '.' + url.split '.' .pop  ;         }     }     return ""; }  16.  Finally, we supply the fail method, which is the generic error handler for all our   functions within the application: function fail error  {     $ 'message' .html 'We encountered a problem: ' +   error.code ; }  65  www.it-ebooks.info   17.  Upon running the application, we can specify a remote file to download on the local  storage, and we will be provided with the file's location on the device. The result will  look something like this:  How it works… In this recipe, we allowed the user to download an external file, publicly accessible on the  Internet, and save it at a specified location on the device. Firstly, we needed to create a  reference to the fileSystem object on the device.  The fileSystem object returns the following properties:   f name: A DOMString object that represents the name of the filesystem  f root: A DirectoryEntry object that represents the root directory of    the filesystem  Once obtained, we can obtain the reference to the desired directory location in which our file  would be saved using the DirectoryEntry object, which returns the following properties:   f isFile: A Boolean value that is always false, as this is a directory  f isDirectory: A Boolean value that is always true  f name: A DOMString representing the name of the directory  f fullPath: A DOMString that represents the full absolute path of the directory from   the root  The DirectoryEntry object contains a number of methods that allow you to interact with  and manipulate the filesystem. For more information about the available methods, check out  the official Cordova file plugin documentation, available at http:  plugins.cordova. io  package org.apache.cordova.file.  66  www.it-ebooks.info   To download the file, we made use of Cordova's fileTransfer object from the file- transfer plugin, and called the object's download method to retrieve the remote file,  saving it in the correct directory. You can check out the official documentation of Cordova's  file-transfer plugin, available at http:  plugins.cordova.io  package org. apache.cordova.file-transfer.  There's more… For any Android application that needs to access or write to the device's local storage  or filesystem, you have to provide the permission for the application to do so within the  manifest Android file.  iOS applications also need to have the relevant permissions added to the Cordova.plist  file to allow access to interact with the device filesystem.  Domain whitelist One issue that you may encounter while running this example project is an error while trying  to download the remote file. Access to remote sites and assets is heavily restricted thanks to  the security model in the Cordova project, whereby the default policy is set to block all remote  network access.  This can easily be amended by the developer to allow access to specific domains or subdomains,  or they can set a wildcard to allow access to every domain, granting full remote network access,  by amending the whitelist access specifications.  To find out more about domain whitelists, check out the official documentation at   https:  cordova.apache.org docs en 3.6.0 guide_appdev_whitelist_ index.md.html.  See also   f Opening a local file from the device storage  67  www.it-ebooks.info   Opening a local file from the device storage While developing your mobile application, you may need or want to read particular files from  the storage system or from another location on the device.  How to do it… In this recipe, we will build an application that will create a text file on the phone's storage  filesystem, write content to the file, and then open the file to display the content:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named devicestorage by running this line:  phonegap create devicestorage com.myapp.devicestorage  devicestorage  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios cordova platform add android  3.  Add the file plugin by running the following line:  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.file  4.  We're going to use the XUI JavaScript library to easily access the DOM elements,    so we'll include the reference to the file within the head tag.  5.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. So, we will have   this:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >          Devices Storage          <script type="text javascript"   src="js xui.js">               68  www.it-ebooks.info           <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                           further code will be placed here                    6.  Within the body tag, create two input elements. Set the first element's type   attribute to text and the id attribute to my_text.  7.  Set the second input element's type attribute to button, the id attribute to   savefile_btn, and value to equal Save.  8.  Finally, include two new div elements. Set the first element's id attribute to message.  This will be the container in which our returned output will be displayed. Set the second  element's id attribute to contents. This will display the contents of the file:                   <input type="button" id="saveFile_btn" value="Save"    >                         9.  Within the empty JavaScript tag block, we need to define a global variable called  fileObject. It will reference the file on the device. We'll also add in our event  listener for our application, which will run once the native PhoneGap code has been  loaded. The onDeviceReady method requests access to the persistent filesystem  root on the device. Once obtained, it will execute the onFileSystemSuccess  method: var fileObject; document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   true ;  function onDeviceReady   {     window.requestFileSystem LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT, 0,   onFileSystemSuccess, fail ; }  The LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT constant is used here to ensure  that we access storage that cannot be removed by the user agent without  permission from the application or the user. We could have used the  LocalFileSystem.TEMPORARY constant to access storage that has  no guarantee of persistence, but this is not recommended.  69  www.it-ebooks.info   10.  With the connection made to the device storage, we can reference the root system   using the fileSystem object provided by PhoneGap. Here, we then call the  getFile method, providing the name of the file that we wish to open. If it doesn't  exist, it will be created for us: function onFileSystemSuccess fileSystem  {     fileSystem.root.getFile "readme.txt",        {create: true, exclusive: false},        gotFileEntry, fail ; }  11.  After a successful response, the returned FileEntry object is assigned to the  fileObject variable we created earlier. At this point, we can also bind a click  handler to our Save button, which will run the saveFileContent function when  clicked on: function gotFileEntry fileEntry  {     fileObject = fileEntry;     x$ 'saveFile_btn' .on 'click', function   {         saveFileContent  ;     } ; }  12. As we're dealing with a local file that doesn't have any content yet, we can use  methods within the PhoneGap API to write to the file. The saveFileContent  method will access fileObject and call the createWriter method to start   this process: function saveFileContent   {     fileObject.createWriter gotFileWriter, fail ; }  13.  Let's now create the gotFileWriter method, which is called as a callback,   from the save function. We'll send the value from the my_text input field to   the writer.write   method to populate the file content. After the writing  completes, we'll output a status message in the message div element and   then instantiate the FileReader object to read the file contents.  14.  We will then pass fileObject to the reader.readAsText   method to return    the text content of the file. After the read completes, we will output the contents   in the div element for display: function gotFileWriter writer  {     var myText = document.getElementById 'my_text' .value;     writer.write myText ;      writer.onwriteend = function evt  {         x$ 'message' .html ' File contents have been   written.  File path:  ' +   fileObject.fullPath + ' ' ;  70  www.it-ebooks.info           var reader = new FileReader  ;         reader.readAsText fileObject ;         reader.onload = function evt  {             x$ 'contents' .html ' File   contents:   ' + evt.target.result ;         };     }; }  15.  Finally, include the fail error handler method to catch any problems or errors:  function fail error  {     alert error.code ; }  16.  Upon running the application on our device, we should see an output similar to this:  How it works… To gain access to the filesystem on the device, we first request access to the persistent storage,  which provides us with access to the fileSystem object.  Navigating to the root of the filesystem, we then call the getFile method, which will look up  the requested file, or create it if it doesn't already exist in the specified location.  Once a user has typed content in the input textbox, we can instantiate a FileWriter object  on the saved object containing the file reference and write the user-supplied content to the  file. We can also make use of the FileWriter object's onwriteend method, which is called  when the request has completed, to output a message to the user and then begin the request  to read the contents of the file. This is achieved through the use of the FileReader object.  For a comprehensive look at the File functions available within the  PhoneGap API, refer to the official documentation at http:  plugins. cordova.io  package org.apache.cordova.file.  71  www.it-ebooks.info   There's more… In this example, we were able to read the file as text, using the readAsText method. We  are also able to read a file and return the contents as a base64-encoded data URL using the  readAsDataURL method. While there are no limitations on what type of file can be read,  depending on the choice of reading method as well as the size of the file, consideration must  be placed on the impact on speed and performance that may occur while trying to read large  files, which may take up quite a lot of processing power.  See also   f Saving a file in the device storage  Displaying the contents of a directory As devices may offer us a lot of storage space that we can potentially use, we can make   sure that we have the ability to traverse the filesystem to ascertain the structure of the   storage available.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will build an application that will read the contents of a directory from the  device's root filesystem, and display it in a list format:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named showdirectory by running this line:  phonegap create showdirectory com.myapp.showdirectory  showdirectory  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios cordova platform add android  3.  Add the file plugin by running the following line:  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.file  4.  We're going to use jQuery Mobile. So, we'll include the reference to the JavaScript    and CSS files within the head tag.  5.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. So, we will    have this:            72  www.it-ebooks.info                     <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery jquery.mobile- 1.1.1.min.css"  >                                Show Directory                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                6.  The jQuery Mobile framework will handle the formatting and layout of the body   content. Include a div element with the data-role attribute set to page. Within  this, we add a header to contain our application title. We'll then add a new div  element with the data-role attribute set to content, inside which we'll place  a ul tag block to hold our directory listings. We set data-role for the ul tag to  listview and give it an id of directoryList so that we can reference it later:                           Directory Reader                             <ul id="directoryList" data-role="listview" data- inset="true">                              73  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  Next, we need to add the event listener and the onDeviceReady method to run  once the native PhoneGap code is ready to be executed. In this method, we will  request access to the file root on the persistent storage, which will then run the  onFileSystemSuccess callback method: document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   false ; function onDeviceReady  {     window.requestFileSystem         LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT,        0, onFileSystemSuccess, fail      ; }  8.  To ensure that we have some extra content to list, we'll call the getDirectory and  getFile methods respectively, which will create the directory and file if they do not  already exist. We can access the DirectoryEntry object at fileSystem.root,  and call the createReader   method from it to instantiate the DirectoryReader  object. Finally, let's call the readEntries   method from this object to read the  entries within the provided directory: function onFileSystemSuccess fileSystem  {        Create some test files     fileSystem.root.getDirectory "myDirectory",         { create: true, exclusive: false },         null,fail ;     fileSystem.root.getFile "readthis.txt",         { create: true, exclusive: false },         null,fail ;      var directoryReader = fileSystem.root.createReader  ;        Get a list of all the entries in the directory     directoryReader.readEntries success,fail ; }  9.  The success callback method is passed as an array of FileEntry and   DirectoryEntry objects. Here, we'll loop over the array and create a list   item for each returned entry, writing the name and the URI path. We'll also   check the type of the entry and display whether it's a directory or a file.  10.  Each list item is appended to the directoryList ul element, and we then call   a listview refresh method on the element to update the content for displaying: function success entries  {     var i;     var objectType;     for  i=0; i<entries.length; i++  {  74  www.it-ebooks.info           if entries[i].isDirectory == true  {             objectType = 'Directory';         } else {             objectType = 'File';         }         $ 'directoryList' .append '  ' +   entries[i].name + '  ' + entries[i].toURI   + ' <p   class="ui-li-aside">Type:  ' + objectType +   '   ' ;     }     $ 'directoryList' .listview "refresh" ; }  11.  Finally, let's include the fail error handler method to alert us of any issues, like this:  function fail error  {     alert "Failed to list directory contents: " +   error.code ; }  12. Upon running the application on our device, the output will look something like this:  75  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… When traversing directories, the PhoneGap API provides the perfect solution in the form of the  DirectoryReader object, which lists all directories and files within the chosen directory.  This contains a single method called readEntries, and it's the success callback method  from this that allows us to loop over the contents and output them as a visual representation.  See also   f Chapter 10, User Interface Development, Creating a jQuery Mobile layout  Creating a local SQLite database SQLite databases are a fantastic way to store structured information from a web context.  SQLite is a self-contained transactional database that does not require any configuration.   It is ideal for saving and querying dynamic information within a mobile application.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will create a mobile application that will allow us to store text entries in a  local SQLite database, and then query the database to retrieve all saved items:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named sqlite by running the following line:  phonegap create sqlite com.myapp.sqlite sqlite  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios cordova platform add android  3.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. So, this is    what you will have:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >  76  www.it-ebooks.info           <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >          SQLite                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                           further code goes here                    4.   In this example, we will be referencing certain elements within the DOM by class  name. To do this, we will use the XUI JavaScript library. Add the script reference  within the head tag of the document to include this library.  5.  Below the PhoneGap JavaScript include, write a new JavaScript tag block, and within   it, define an onDeviceReady event listener to ensure that the device is ready and  fully loaded before the application proceeds to execute the code:     SQLite   6.  Add an input element within the body tags with the id attribute set to list_  action. This will allow the user to add entries to the database list.  7.  Below this, add a button element with the id attribute set to saveItem. 8.  Let's also add two div elements to hold any generated data. The first, with the id  attribute set to message, will hold any database connection error messages if we  have issues trying to connect. The second, with the id attribute set to listItems,  will act as a container in which our generated list will be placed for display:      My ToDo List                         77  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  With the layout complete, let's move on to adding our custom JavaScript code.    To begin with, we need to define the deviceready event listener. As we are   using the XUI library, for this recipe, we will write this function as follows: x$ document .on "deviceready", function    {  } ;  10.  As we want to set the inner HTML values for the list and message div containers,  let's define the references to those particular elements. XUI makes this really easy.  We'll create a global variable called db, which will eventually hold our database  connection.  11.  Let's also bind a click handler to the saveItem button element. When pressed, it will   run the insertItem method to add a new record to the database.  12. We now need to create a reference to our SQLite database. The PhoneGap API   includes a function called openDatabase that creates a new database instance or  opens the database if it already exists. The returned object will allow us to perform  transactions against the database: var listElement     = x$ 'listItems' ; var messageElement  = x$ 'message' ; var db;  x$ 'saveItem' .on 'click', function e  {     insertItem  ; } ;     Create a reference to the database function getDatabase   { return window.openDatabase "todoListDB",             "1.0", "ToDoList Database", 200000 ; }  13.  We can now include the call to and create the onDeviceReady method. Here, we   assign the database instance to the db variable, which will allow us to perform a  transaction on the database. In this case, we'll execute a simple SQL script to create  a table called MYLIST, if it doesn't already exist:    Run the onDeviceReady method onDeviceReady  ;     PhoneGap is ready function onDeviceReady   { db = getDatabase  ; db.transaction function tx  { tx.executeSql 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MYLIST  78  www.it-ebooks.info       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, list_action ' ;     }, databaseError, getItems ; }  14.  Let's now define the getItems method, which is run on a successful callback from   the database transaction in the previous method. Once again, we reference the  database object and perform another transaction, this time to select all items from  the table: function getItems   {     db.transaction function tx  {     tx.executeSql 'SELECT * FROM MYLIST', [],        querySuccess, databaseError ;     }, databaseError ; }  15.  Having received the results from the select query, we can loop over them and create   list item elements that we can then set within the list div container. Here, we can  reference the id and list_action columns from the results, drawn from the SQLite  database table that we created earlier. We'll also output a user-friendly message  displaying the total number of records stored, as follows:    Process the SQLResultSetList function querySuccess tx, results  {     var len = results.rows.length;     var output = '';     for  var i=0; i<len; i++ {        output = output +           ' ' +           results.rows.item i .list_action + ' ';     }     messageElement.html ' There are ' + len + ' items in   your list: ' ;     listElement.html ' ' + output + ' ' ; }  16.  We initially bound a click event handler to our saveItem button. Let's now create   the insertItem method, which the click handler will invoke. We want to take the  value of the list_action text input box and pass it to the database transaction  when we run an insert query. A successful insertion will call our getItems method  to query the database and populate the list with all updated information from our  database:    Insert a record into the database function insertItem   {     var insertValue =     document.getElementById 'list_action' .value;  79  www.it-ebooks.info       db.transaction function tx  {     tx.executeSql 'INSERT INTO MYLIST         list_action  VALUES  "' + insertValue + '" ' ;     }, databaseError, getItems ;        Clear the value from the input box     document.getElementById 'list_action' .value = ''; }  17.  Finally, let's include our databaseError fault handler method to display any issues   that we may encounter from the database, and display them in the message div  element:    Database error handler function databaseError error  {     messageElement.html "SQL Error: " + error.code ; }  18.  Upon running the application on the device, your output should look something like   what is shown here:  How it works... In order to access the SQLite database and perform any transactions, we first need to  establish a connection with the .db file on the device using the openDatabase method.  Once this connection is established, we can use the SQLTransaction object to perform  executeSql methods such as table creation, selection, and insertion queries, written using  standard SQL syntax.  For more details on the full methods available for use with the SQLite  implementation, check out the official Cordova storage documentation at  http:  docs.phonegap.com en 3.5.0 cordova_storage_ storage.md.html.  80  www.it-ebooks.info   There's more... The storage API accessible through Cordova is based on the W3C Web SQL Database  specification. Some devices already have an implementation of this specification. If any   device that your application runs on provides this functionality, it will use its built-in support  for the storage specification and will not use Cordova's implementation.  See also   f Chapter 7, Working with XUI  Uploading a file on a remote server Sometimes, working with only the local system for mobile applications is not enough. There  are use cases for the requirement to interact with a remote server, for example, to share a file.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will build an application that allows the user to take a photograph and  upload it on a remote server:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named upload by running the following line:  phonegap create upload com.myapp.upload upload  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios cordova platform add android  3.  Add the file, camera, and file-transfer plugins by running these lines of code:  phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.file phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.file-transfer  4.  We're going to use the XUI JavaScript library to easily access the DOM elements,    so we'll include the reference to the file within the head tag.  5.  Open www index.html. Let's clean up the unnecessary elements, so we will    have this:                      81  www.it-ebooks.info           <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <script type="text javascript"   src="js xui.js">           Upload                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                6.  We now need to create some elements within the body tag. Let's include a button  element with the id attribute set to selectorBtn. Create a div element with the  id attribute set to message, which we'll use to display status updates from the  transfer. Finally, we'll create an img tag with the id attribute set to returnImage:        Take Photo                    7.  We can now include our event handler to ensure that the device is ready before   proceeding, as well as create our onDeviceReady method. In this method, we will  bind the selectorBtn element to a touchstart event. When pressed, this will  call the camera.getPicture method from the PhoneGap API, which will open the  device's default camera application to let our user take a photo to upload: document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   true ;  function onDeviceReady   {          x$ "selectorBtn" .touchstart function e  {  82  www.it-ebooks.info           navigator.camera.getPicture              gotPicture,                 onError,                 {                 sourceType:Camera.PictureSourceType.CAMERA,            destinationType:Camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI,                     quality:50                 }          ;     } ; }  Use Camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY or Camera. PictureSourceType.SAVEDPHOTOALBUM if we wanted the user  to select an image to upload from their saved photos.  8.  We now include the gotPicture method as the success callback, having obtained  an image. We have the location of the file as a provided parameter. Let's update the  message div to display a friendly message to our users, and then we'll create a new  instance of the FileUploadOptions object, which we'll use to specify additional  parameters for the upload script. The options.fileKey value sets the name for   the form field that will contain the uploaded file.  9.  We can now create a new instance of the FileTransfer object, from which we'll   call the upload method. Here, we can pass the file's location on the device and the  remote address to upload it at, and also send any additional parameters that we may  have included in the options object: function gotPicture fileLocation  {     x$ "message" .html " Uploading your image... " ;      var options = new FileUploadOptions  ;     options.fileKey     =   "file";     options.fileName    =     fileLocation.substr fileLocation.lastIndexOf ' ' +1 ;     options.mimeType    =   "image jpeg";     options.chunkedMode =   false;      var fileTransfer = new FileTransfer  ;     fileTransfer.upload          fileLocation,         "http:  address_to_remote_server_page upload.php",         fileUploaded,         onError,         options      ; }  83  www.it-ebooks.info   In this example, I have used ColdFusion as the dynamic server- side language to process the upload. You can, of course, use any  server-side language that you have access to or feel comfortable  using to manage the upload.  10.  Let's now create the callback handler, following a successful upload. The response   parameter is a FileUploadResult object, and from it, we can obtain the total  number of bytes sent as well as the output response from the server. In this case,  we are returning the image from the server-side script, and we will set it as the src  attribute for the returnImage img element, like this: function fileUploaded result  { x$ "message" .html ' Upload complete!! Bytes sent:   ' + result.bytesSent + ' ' ;     x$ "returnImage" .attr "src", result.response ; }  11.  Finally, let's create our onError fault handler to alert us of any possible issues:  function onError error  {     alert "Error: " + JSON.stringify error  ; }  12. When you run the application on a device, the output should look something like this:  13.  Following a successful response from the remote server, the application will display   something similar to this:  84  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... Firstly, we need to define how we are going to retrieve our image from the device using the  camera.getPicture method. Once we have obtained our picture, we can start building   our FileTransfer object, which will handle the transaction to the remote server for us. We  can then create a FileUploadOptions object, which specifies any additional parameters  to use on the server-side handling page. The properties available for use within the  FileUploadOptions object are as follows:   f fileKey: A DOMString that represents the name of the form element. The default   value is file.   f fileName: A DOMString that represents the name you wish the file to be saved as    on the server. The default value is image.jpg.   f mimeType: A DOMString that represents the MIME type of the data that you wish    to upload. The default value is image jpeg.   f params: An object that allows you to set optional key value pairs to be included in   the HTTP request.   f chunkedMode: A boolean value that determines whether or not the data should be   uploaded in chunked streaming mode. The default value is true.  Finally, our success callback method will contain the FileUploadResult object returned  from the transaction, which gives us access to the response from the server as well as the  number of bytes sent in the upload, which we can then output, store, or use in any way we  need to.  85  www.it-ebooks.info   For more details on the FileTransfer object, check out the official Cordova  documentation at http:  docs.phonegap.com en 2.0.0 cordova_file_file. md.htmlFileTransfer.  See also   f Chapter 6, Hooking into Native Events, Displaying network connection status  Caching content using the local storage API As mobile users access applications and pull remote data on the move, we need to be  conscious and aware that our application may be using up the limited data services. We can  implement services and techniques to help reduce unnecessary remote calls to data.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will build an application that allows the user to search Twitter using its open  API. We'll store the results for the search in localStorage so that they are available when  we reopen the application:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named localstorage by running this line: phonegap create localstorage com.myapp.localstorage localstorage  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios cordova platform add android  3.  We will be using the jQuery Mobile framework for our layout, so we include the   relevant CSS and JavaScript file references within the head tag.  4.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. So, we will have   this code:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >  86  www.it-ebooks.info           <link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery jquery.mobile- 1.1.1.min.css"  >                                LocalStorage                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                5.  Within the body tag, create a new div element with the data-role attribute set to   page, which will form the container for the jQuery Mobile layout:                    6.  Let's place some more layout structure in our application, which is required by the   jQuery Mobile framework. Create a new div element with the id attribute set to  header. The data-role and data-position attributes must also be set as  shown.  7.  Within the header, we'll display an anchor tag to exit the application. We specify   the id attribute and also set a specific icon to display in the header thanks to the  data-icon attribute.  8.  We'll include an h2 heading to add a title to the application, as well as a second  button, which we'll use to clear any cached content. This too has a specific icon   set in the data-icon attribute as well as the id attribute to allow us to reference   it via our JavaScript:        <a id="exit_btn" data-inline="true"  data-theme="b"   data-icon="home">Exit        Local Storage Search   87  www.it-ebooks.info       <a id="clear_btn" data-inline="true" data-theme="b"   data-icon="delete">Clear Storage      9.  Below this, create a new div element with the data-role attribute set to content.   This will house a second div block, inside which we'll place two input elements.  The first holds the user's search criteria, the second is the button used to perform   the search.  10.  We'll now include a ul element with the id attribute set to tweetResults and the   data-role attribute set to listview, which will hold our returned data:                   <input type="search" name="search" id="searchTerm" data- inline="true" data-icon="search"  >         <input type="button" id="search_btn" value="Search" data- theme="b" data-inline="true"  >      <ul id="tweetResults" data-role="listview"         data-inset="true">                   11.  With the layout complete, we can start adding our custom code. Include a new  JavaScript tag block before the closing head tag. Inside it, let's write an event   listener to ensure that the PhoneGap native code has loaded before we proceed: document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   true ;  12. Let's start adding the custom code that will be run when the device is ready. Create   the onDeviceReady function. At the start, we'll set some required variables; the first  two will hold some messages to output to our users. The second is a reference to the  localStorage interface, which we'll use to save our data in key-value pairs.  13.  We need to run a check to see whether any content from a previous request has been  stored by calling the getItem method on the localStorage object. If it exists, we'll  display a user-friendly message, set the search term from the previous search in the  input box, display the clear button by calling the showClearButton method, and  finally loop over the results to display them by calling the outputResults method.  88  www.it-ebooks.info   14.  If we have no previous results saved in localStorage, we'll simply display a   welcome message to the user and ensure that the clear button is hidden: function onDeviceReady   {        Create the friendly messages and define the   variables     var previousMessage =   'Here are your previous search   results..';     var welcomeMessage  =   'What would you like to search   for?';     var localStorage    =   window.localStorage;       * Firstly, check to see if localStorage     has any cached content from a previous request. *      if localStorage.getItem 'twitSearchResults'   {           * We have saved content,      so display a nice message to the user *          $ 'body h2' .html previousMessage ;           * Set the value of the stored search      term into the input box *    $ 'searchTerm' .val localStorage.getItem 'searchTerm'  ;             Display the clear button         showClearButton  ;             Send the stored data to be rendered as HTML outputResults JSON.parse localStorage. getItem 'twitSearchResults'   ;     } else {          * There is nothing cached,         so display a friendly message *          $ 'body h2' .html welcomeMessage ;         hideClearButton  ;     }         add click handlers here  }  15.  Within the onDeviceReady function, we now need to set up the click handlers for  each of our buttons. The first is the clear_btn element, which when clicked on will  clear the values in the tweetResults div element, and remove the data that we  have cached by calling the clear method on the localStorage object.  89  www.it-ebooks.info   16.  The second handler is applied to the exit_btn element, which will gracefully close   the application:  * Add a click handler to the clear button which will be displayed is a user returns to the page with saved content *  $ 'clear_btn' .click function   {        Clear the entire local storage object     localStorage.clear  ;        Clear the content list     $ 'tweetResults' .html '' ;     $ 'tweetResults' .hide  ;       * There is nothing cached,       so display a friendly message *      $ 'body h2' .html welcomeMessage ;         Remove the clear button     hideClearButton  ;         Reset the search term input field     $ 'searchTerm' .val '' ;  } ;  $ 'exit_btn' .click function   {     navigator.app.exitApp  ; } ;  17.  The third click handler will be placed on the search_btn element, which will  take the search term provided by the user and pass it to a new function, called  makeSearchRequest:  * Add a click handler to the search button     which will make our AJAX requests for us *  $ 'search_btn' .click function   {   * Obtain the value of the search term and send it     through to the request function *  makeSearchRequest $ 'searchTerm' .val   ;  18.  Before we make the call, we'll save the search term in localStorage using the   setItem   method. This will allow us to reference it at any time until we have  cleared the cache.  } ;  90  www.it-ebooks.info   19.  To make the request to the remote API, we'll utilize jQuery's built-in ajax   method,   here asking for five results per page on the search term provided by the user. To  handle the returned data, we'll also specify the jsonpCallback method, which in  this case is a new function called storeResults: function makeSearchRequest searchTerm  {         Display a user-friendly message     $ 'body h2' .html 'Searching for: '+ searchTerm ;       * Store the value we are searching      for into the localStorage object *      localStorage.setItem 'searchTerm', searchTerm ;         Make the request to the Twitter search API     $.ajax {         url: "http:  search.twitter.com search.json?q="+         searchTerm+"&rpp=5",         dataType: "jsonp",         jsonpCallback: "storeResults"     } ;  }  20. Once we have obtained a response from the request, we'll check to make sure    that we have access to the localStorage functionality, and if we do, we'll save   the entire response, converting the JSON data into a string before we output the  results to the user: function storeResults data  {      * Save the latest search results,     coercing the data from an object into a string *      localStorage.setItem              'twitSearchResults',         JSON.stringify data  ;     outputResults data ; }  21.  We have the raw JSON data with which to create our output. Here, we loop through  the results to create the required HTML blocks for displaying. As Twitter information  contains a lot of links to users and dates, we'll also ensure that we have those  converted for our users.  22. Within the loop, we'll append each processed result to the tweetResults ul tag   block as an individual list item element.  91  www.it-ebooks.info   23. Once the processing is complete, we call the need to refresh the list to reload the   contents ready for display: function outputResults data  {         Clear the content and hide the results element     $ 'tweetResults' .html '' ;         Loop through the results in the JSON object     $.each data.results,         function i, tweet  {          * Replace and define any URLs         for inclusion in the output *          tweet.text =   tweet.text.replace    https?s?ftpssh \:\ \ [^"\s\ ]*[^.  ,;'">\:\s\ \ \]\!]  g,             function url  {                 return ' '+url+' ';             } .replace  \B@ [_a-z0-9]+  ig,             function reply  {                 return  reply.charAt 0 +'<a href="http:  twitter. com '+reply.substring 1 +'">'+reply.substring 1 +' ';         } ;          $ 'tweetResults' .append ' <img src="' +   tweet.profile_image_url + '"  > @' + tweet.from_user_name + '<  h3> ' + tweet.text + ' <p   class="ui-li-aside">  ' ;     } ;        Refresh the list view     $ 'tweetResults' .listview "refresh" ; }  24.  Let's now create the functions needed to handle the visual display of our button to   clear the localStorage cache. We can reference the button id attribute and then  apply the css   jQuery method to alter its style: function showClearButton   {     $ "clear_btn" .css 'display', 'block' ; }  function hideClearButton   {     $ "clear_btn" .css 'display', 'none' ; }  92  www.it-ebooks.info   Here, we are directly changing the styles of the elements. You can amend  this code to add and remove a CSS class to handle the display instead.  25. Finally, let's include our onError function, which will be fired if we encounter any   issues along the way: function onError error  {     alert "Error: " + JSON.stringify error  ; }  26. For any users running the application for the first time or with an empty cache, the   application will look something like this:  27.  Once a request has been made, every time the user opens the application, they   will be presented with the details of their previous search request, as shown in the  following screenshot, unless they clear the cache or make a new request:  93  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... To cache and store our data from the request, we simply saved the values, assigning them to  a key that we could reference and using the setItem method in the localStorage object.  We were then able to reference the storage to see whether that particular key existed by  calling the getItem method. If nothing was present, we would make a new remote call and  then save the data that was returned.  Lawnchair The localStorage options provided with the Cordova API do a fantastic job of persisting and  allowing us to easily access and retrieve saved data.  For those of you who wish to explore the alternative storage options, check out Lawnchair, an  open source project written by Brian Leroux. Built with mobile applications in mind, Lawnchair  is a lightweight JavaScript file that is extensible and can be used with a number of adaptors to  cause data to persist, using key-value pairs, and it has an incredibly simple API.  You can find out more about Lawnchair at  http:  brian.io lawnchair .  94  www.it-ebooks.info   4  Working with Audio,  Images, and Video  In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:   f Capturing audio using the device audio recording application  f Recording audio within your application  f Playing audio files from the local filesystem or over HTTP  f Capturing a video using the device video recording application  f Loading a photograph from the device camera roll library  f Applying an effect to an image using canvas  f Playing a remote video  Introduction This chapter will include a number of recipes that outline the functionality required to capture  audio, video, and camera data, as well as the playback of audio files from the local system  and remote host. We will also take a look at how to use the HTML5 canvas element to edit   an image on the fly.  Capturing audio using the device audio  recording application PhoneGap, through the Cordova media-capture plugin API, gives developers the ability to  interact with the audio recording application on their device and save the recorded audio file  for later use.  95  www.it-ebooks.info   How to do it... We'll make use of the Capture object and the captureAudio method of the media plugin  API. The method will invoke the native device audio recording application to record our audio:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named audiorecord by running the   following command: phonegap create audiorecord com.myapp.audiorecord audiorecord  2.  Add the device's platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the media-capture plugin by running the following command:  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.media-capture  4.  Open www index.html. Let's clean up the unnecessary elements. We will    use jQuery Mobile, so we have to make a reference. We'll also set a style sheet  reference pointing to style.css:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <!-- WARNING: for iOS 7, remove the width=device-width and  height=device-height attributes. See   https:  issues.apache.org jira browse CB-4323 -->         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"   href="style.css"  >                     Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">             96  www.it-ebooks.info                      5.  Create a new button element within the body tags of the document, and set    the id attribute to record. We'll use this to bind a touch handler to it:  capture audio   6.  Create a new file called style.css, and include some CSS to format the    button element: record {   display: block;   padding: .4em .8em;   text-decoration: none;   text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba 0,0,0,.3 ;   -webkit-transition:.3s -webkit-box-shadow, .3s padding;   transition:.3s box-shadow, .3s padding;   border-radius: 200px;   background: rgba 255,0,0,.6 ;   width: 10em;   height: 10em;   color: white;   position: absolute;   top: 25%;   left: 25%; }  With the user interface added to the page and the styles applied, the application  looks something like this:  97  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  Now, let's start adding our custom code. Create a new script tag block before   the closing head tag. Within this, we'll set up our event listener, which will call the  onDeviceReady method once the PhoneGap code is ready to run.  8.  We'll also create a global variable called audioCapture. It will hold our    capture object:       document.addEventListener "deviceready",onDeviceReady, true ;      var audioCapture = '';    9.  We now need to create the onDeviceReady method. It will assign the capture  object to the variable that we defined earlier. We'll also bind a touchstart event  to the button element, which when pressed will run the getAudio method to  commence the capture process: function onDeviceReady   {     audioCapture = navigator.device.capture;      $ 'record' .bind 'touchstart', function   {         getAudio  ;     } ; }  10.  To begin the audio capture, we need to call the captureAudio   method from the  global capture object. This function accepts three parameters. The first is the name  of the method to run after a successful transaction. The second is the name of the  error handler method to run if we encounter any problems trying to obtain the audio.  The third is an array of configuration options for the capture request.  11.  In this example, we are forcing the application to retrieve only one audio capture,   which is also the default value: function getAudio   {     audioCapture.captureAudio          onSuccess,         onError,         {limit: 1}      ; }  12. Continuing from a successful transaction, we will receive an array of objects   containing the details of each audio file that was captured. We'll loop over this   array and generate a string containing all the properties for each file, which we'll  insert into the DOM before the button element: function onSuccess audioObject  {     var i, output = '';  98  www.it-ebooks.info       for  i = 0; i < audioObject.length; i++  {         output += 'Name: ' + audioObject[i].name + ' '   +             'Full Path: ' + audioObject[i].fullPath + '<br    >' +             'Type: ' + audioObject[i].type + ' ' +             'Created: '     + new Date audioObject[i].lastModifiedDate  + ' '   +              'Size: ' + audioObject[i].size + '<br    >========';     }      $ 'record' .before output ; }  13.  If we encounter an error during the process, the onError method will fire. This   method will provide us with access to an error object, that contains the code for the  error. We can use a switch statement here to customize the message that we will  return to our user: function onError error  {     var errReason;     switch error.code  {         case 0:             errReason = 'The microphone failed to capture   sound.';         break;        case 1:            errReason = 'The audio capture application is   currently busy with another request.';        break;        case 2:            errReason = 'An invalid parameter was sent to   the API.';        break;        case 3:            errReason = 'You left the audio capture   application without recording anything.';        break;        case 4:            errReason = 'Your device does not support the   audio capture request.';        break;     }     alert 'The following error occurred: ' + errReason ; }  99  www.it-ebooks.info   If we run our application and press the button, the device's default audio recording  application will open and we will be able to record our audio, as follows:  14.  Once we have finished recording, our application will receive the audio data from the   callback method and output it like this:  100  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… The Capture object, available through the media-capture API, allows us to access the  media-capture capabilities of the device. By specifying the media type that we wish to  capture by calling the captureAudio method, an asynchronous call is made to the device's  native audio recording application.  In this example, we requested the capture of only one audio file. Setting the limit value within  the optional configuration to a value greater than 1 can alter this.  The request is completed when one of these two things happens:   f The maximum number of recordings possible have been created  f The user exits the native audio recording application  Following a successful callback from the request operation, we receive an array of objects.  This array contains the properties for each individual media file, which contains the following  properties that we can read:   f name: A DOMString that contains the name of the file  f fullPath: A DOMString that contains the full path of the file  f type: A DOMString that includes the MIME type of the returned media file  f lastModifiedTime: A Date object that contains the date and time when the file   was last modified   f size: A Number that contains the size of the file in bytes  To find out more about the captureAudio capabilities  offered by the PhoneGap API, check out the official  documentation at http:  plugins.cordova.io   package org.apache.cordova.media-capture.  See also   f The Playing audio files from the local filesystem or over HTTP section of this chapter  101  www.it-ebooks.info   Recording audio within your application The PhoneGap API provides us with the ability to record audio directly within our application,  bypassing the native audio recording application.  How to do it... We will use the Media object to create a reference to an audio file in which we'll record the  audio data:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named audioapi by running this line:  phonegap create audioapi com.myapp.audioapi audioapi  2.  Add the device's platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the media-capture plugins by running this line: cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.media  4.  Open www index.html. Let's clean up the unnecessary elements. We will use   jQuery Mobile, so we have to make a reference:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link type="text css"   href="jquery css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.23.custom.css"   rel="stylesheet"  >         <script type="text javascript" src="jquery jquery- 1.8.0.min.js">          <script type="text javascript" src="jquery jquery- ui-1.8.23.custom.min.js">           Hello World               102  www.it-ebooks.info           <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                5.  We include three elements within the body of our application. The first is a div   with the id attribute set to progressbar, the second is a div tag with the id  attribute set to message, and the third is a button element with the id attribute   set to record:           6.  Now, let's start adding our custom code within the empty script tag block. We'll  begin by defining some global variables that we'll use in the application. We'll also  create the event listener to ensure that the device is ready before we proceed.  7.  Then, the onDeviceReady function will run a new function called recordPrepare:  var maxTime = 10,     countdownInt = 3,     src,     audioRecording,     stopRecording;  function onDeviceReady   {     recordPrepare  ; }  document.addEventListener "deviceready",  onDeviceReady,   false ;  8.  The recordPrepare button will be used more than once in our application to reset   the state of the button to record audio. Here, we unbind any actions applied to the  button, set the HTML value, and bind the touchstart handler to run a function  called recordAudio: function recordPrepare   {     $ 'record' .unbind  ;     $ 'record' .html 'Start recording' ;     $ 'record' .bind 'touchstart', function   {         recordAudio  ;     } ; }  103  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  Let's now create the recordAudio   function, which will create the audio file.   We'll switch the value and bind events applied to our button to allow the user  to manually end the recording. We will also set the Media object to a variable,  audioRecording, and pass the destination for the file in the form of the src  parameter as well as the success and error callback methods.  10.  A setInterval method is included. It will count down from 3 to 0 to give the   user some time to prepare for the recording. When the countdown is complete,  we invoke the startRecord method from the Media object and start another  setInterval method. This will count to 10 and automatically stop the recording  when the limit is reached: function recordAudio   {      $ 'record' .unbind  ;     $ 'record' .html 'Stop recording' ;     $ 'record' .bind 'touchstart', function   {         stopRecording  ;     } ;      src = 'recording_' + Math.round new   Date  .getTime   1000  + '.mp3';      audioRecording = new Media src, onSuccess, onError ;      var startCountdown = setInterval function   {          $ 'message' .html 'Recording will start in ' +   countdownInt + ' seconds...' ;         countdownInt = countdownInt -1;          if countdownInt <= 0  {             countdownInt = 3;             clearInterval startCountdown ;             audioRecording.startRecord  ;              var recTime = 0;                 recInterval = setInterval function   {                 recTime = recTime + 1;                  $ 'message' .html Math.round maxTime -   recTime  + ' seconds remaining...' ;  104  www.it-ebooks.info                   var progPerc = 100-  100 maxTime  *   recTime ;                 setProgress progPerc ;                  if  recTime >= maxTime  {                     stopRecording  ;                 }             }, 1000 ;         }     }, 1000 ; }  11.  While our recording is underway, we can update the progress bar using the jQuery UI   library and set it to the current value to show how much time is remaining: function setProgress progress  {     $ "progressbar" .progressbar {             value: progress     } ; }  12. When a recording is stopped, we want to clear the interval timer and run the   stopRecord method from the Media object. We'll also reset the value of the  progress bar to 0 and reset the button bindings to prepare for the next recording: function stopRecording   {     clearInterval recInterval ;     audioRecording.stopRecord  ;     setProgress 0 ;     recordPrepare  ; }  13.  Finally, we can add in our success and error callback methods:  function onSuccess   {     $ 'message' .html 'Audio file successfully     created: ' + src ; }  function onError error  {     $ 'message' .html 'code: ' + error.code    + '\n' +           'message: ' + error.message + '\n' ; }  105  www.it-ebooks.info   14.  When the application is run to start the recording, the output will look somewhat    like this:  15.  After a successful recording, the user will be presented with the URI to the recorded   file, which we can use to access, upload, or play back the file.  106  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... The Media object has the ability to record and play back audio files. When we choose to use  this object for recording, we need to provide the method with the URI for the destination file on  the local device.  To start a recording, we simply call the startRecord method from the Media object, and to  stop the recording, we need to call the stopRecord method.  To find out more about the available methods within the Media object,  refer to the official documentation, available at http:  plugins. cordova.io  package org.apache.cordova.media.  See also   f The Saving a file in the device storage section of Chapter 3, Filesystems, Storage, and    f The Opening a local file from the device storage section of Chapter 3, Filesystems,   Local Databases  Storage, and Local Databases  Playing audio files from the local filesystem  or over HTTP PhoneGap and the media plugin API provide us with a relatively straightforward process  to play back audio files. These can be files stored within the application's local filesystem,  bundled with the application, or over remote files accessible by a network connection.  Wherever the files may be, the method of playback is achieved in exactly the same way.  How to do it... We must create a new Media object and pass to it the location of the audio file we want to  play back:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named audioplaying by running the   following command: phonegap create audioplaying com.myapp.audioplaying audioplaying  2.  Add the device's platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  107  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Add the media and file-transfer plugins by running the following commands:  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.media  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.file-transfer  4.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. We will use jQuery   Mobile, so we need to make a reference:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery jquery.mobile- 1.1.1.min.css" type="text css">         <script type="text javascript" src="jquery jquery- 1.8.0.min.js">          <script type="text javascript"   src="jquery jquery.mobile-1.1.1.min.js">           Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                               5.  Create the layout for the application within the body tags. Here, we are specifying  a page for the jQuery Mobile framework and four key div elements that have been  assigned the role of buttons. We will reference their id attributes in our code:                  PhoneGap Audio Player                108  www.it-ebooks.info           <div data-role="button"         id="playLocalAudio">Play Local Audio          <div data-role="button"         id="playRemoteAudio">Play Remote Audio          <div data-role="button"         id="pauseaudio">Pause Audio          <div data-role="button"         id="stopaudio">Stop Audio                           Current:           0 sec                Total:           0  sec                      6.  We create a new script tag block within the head tag to contain our custom code,  into which we'll add our event listener in order to check whether the device is ready   to proceed, and some required global variables:       document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   true ;      var audioMedia = null,         audioTimer = null,         duration = -1,         is_paused = false;    7.  The onDeviceReady method binds a touchstart event to all four of our buttons   in the main page content. For the local audio option, this example is set to read a  file from the Android asset location. In both the play functions, we pass the audio  source to the playAudio method: function onDeviceReady   {      $ "playLocalAudio" .bind 'touchstart', function   {          stopAudio  ;         var srcLocal =   ' android_asset www CFHour_Intro.mp3';         playAudio srcLocal ;  109  www.it-ebooks.info       } ;          $ "playRemoteAudio" .bind 'touchstart', function   {          stopAudio  ;         var srcRemote =   'http:  traffic.libsyn.com cfhour Show_138_-_ESAPI_StackOverflow_ and_Community.mp3';         playAudio srcRemote ;      } ;  }      $ "pauseaudio" .bind 'touchstart', function   {         pauseAudio  ;     } ;      $ "stopaudio" .bind 'touchstart', function   {         stopAudio  ;     } ;  8.  Now, let's add the playAudio method. This will check whether the audioMedia  object has been assigned and we have an active audio file. If not, we will reset the  duration and position values and create a new Media object reference, passing in  the source of the audio file.  9.  To update the duration and current position of the audio file, we will set a new    interval timer. It will check once every second and obtain these details from   the getCurrentPosition and getDuration methods, available from the   Media object: function playAudio src  {      if  audioMedia === null  {         $ "mediaDuration" .html "0" ;          $ "audioPosition" .html "Loading..." ;         audioMedia = new Media src, onSuccess, onError ;         audioMedia.play  ;     } else {         if  is_paused  {             is_paused = false;             audioMedia.play  ;         }     }  110  www.it-ebooks.info       if  audioTimer === null  {         audioTimer = setInterval function   { audioMedia.getCurrentPosition  function position  {   if  position > -1  {    setAudioPosition Math.round position  ;     if  duration <= 0  {    duration = audioMedia.getDuration  ;         if  duration > 0  {           duration = Math.round duration ;        $ "mediaDuration" .html duration ;         }     }   } }, function error  {   console.log "Error getting position=" + error ;   setAudioPosition "Error: " + error ; }          ;         }, 1000 ;     } }  10.  The setAudioPosition method will update the content in the audioPosition   element with the current details: function setAudioPosition position  {     $ "audioPosition" .html position + " sec" ; }  11.  Now we can include the two remaining methods assigned to the touch handlers to   control the pausing and stopping of the audio playback: function pauseAudio   {     if  is_paused  return;     if  audioMedia  {         is_paused = true;         audioMedia.pause  ;     } }  function stopAudio   {     if  audioMedia  {         audioMedia.stop  ;  111  www.it-ebooks.info           audioMedia.release  ;         audioMedia = null;     }     if  audioTimer  {         clearInterval audioTimer ;         audioTimer = null;     }      is_paused = false;     duration = 0; }  12. Finally, let's write the success and error callback methods. In essence, they both reset   the values to the default positions in preparation for the next playback request: function onSuccess   {     setAudioPosition duration ;     clearInterval audioTimer ;     audioTimer = null;     audioMedia = null;     is_paused = false;     duration = -1; }  function onError error  {     alert 'code: ' + error.code + '\n' +              'message: ' + error.message + '\n' ;     clearInterval audioTimer ;     audioTimer = null;     audioMedia = null;     is_paused = false;     setAudioPosition "0" ; }  13.  Run the application on the device. The output will be similar to what is shown here:  112  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... The Media object has the ability to record and play back audio files. For media playback,   we simply pass the location of the audio file, remote or local, to the Media instantiation call,  along with the success and error handlers.  Playback is controlled by the Media objects' methods available through the media plugin API.  To find out more about all the available methods within the Media object,  refer to the official documentation at http:  plugins.cordova. io  package org.apache.cordova.media.  There's more... In this example, we assumed that the developer is building for an Android device, and so we  referenced the location of the local file using the android_asset reference. To cater to other  devices' operating systems, you can use the Device object, available in the device plugin, to  determine which platform is running the application. Using the response from this check, you  can write a switch statement to provide the correct path to the local file.  To learn more about the Device object, refer to the official  documentation, which is available at http:  plugins. cordova.io  package org.apache.cordova.device.  Capturing a video using the device video  recording application PhoneGap, through the media plugin API, provides us with the ability to easily access the  native video recording application on our mobile device and save the captured footage.  How to do it... We will use the Capture object and the captureVideo method that it contains to invoke  the native video recording application:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named videorecording by running the   following command: phonegap create videorecording com.myapp.videorecording  videorecording  113  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Add the device's platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the media and file-transfer plugins by running the following commands:  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.media  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.file-transfer  4.  Open www index.html. Let's clean up the unnecessary elements. We will    use jQuery Mobile, so we have to make a reference. We'll also set a style sheet  reference pointing to style.css:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >          <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"   href="style.css"  >         <script type="text javascript"              src="jquery jquery-1.8.0.min.js">           Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                               5.  Create a new button element within the body tags of the document, and set the id   attribute to record. We'll use this to bind a touch handler to it:  capture video   114  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  Now, let's start adding our custom code. Create a new script tag block before   the closing head tag. Within this, we'll set up our event listener, which will call the  onDeviceReady method once the PhoneGap code is ready to run.  7.  We'll also create a global variable called videoCapture. It will hold our    capture object: document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady, true ;  var videoCapture = '';  8.  We now need to  create the onDeviceReady method. This method will assign the  capture object to the variable we defined earlier. We'll also bind a touchstart  event to the button element, which when pressed will run the getVideo method   to commence the capture process: function onDeviceReady   {    videoCapture = navigator.device.capture;     $ 'record' .bind 'touchstart', function   {         getVideo  ;      } ; }  9.  To begin the video capture, we need to call the captureVideo method from the   global capture object. This function accepts three parameters. The first is the name  of the method to run after a successful transaction. The second is the name of the  error handler method to run if we encounter any problems trying to obtain the video.  Finally, the third is an array of configuration options for the capture request. 10.  In this example, we are requesting the application to retrieve two separate    video captures: function getVideo   {     videoCapture.captureVideo          onSuccess,         onError,         {limit: 2}      ; }  11.  Following on from a successful transaction, we will receive an array of objects   containing the details for each video file that was captured. We'll loop over this   array  and generate a string containing all the properties for each file, which we'll  insert into the DOM before the button element: function onSuccess videoObject  {     var i, output = '';     for  i = 0; i < videoObject.length; i += 1  {  115  www.it-ebooks.info           output += 'Name: ' + videoObject[i].name + ' '   +             'Full Path: ' + videoObject[i].fullPath + ' ' +              'Type: ' + videoObject[i].type + ' ' +              'Created: '     + new Date videoObject[i].lastModifiedDate  + ' '   +              'Size: ' + videoObject[i].size + '<br    >========';        }     $ 'record' .before output ; }  12.  If we encounter an error during the process, the onError method will fire. This method   will provide us with access to an error object, which contains the code for the error.  We can use a switch statement here to customize the message that we will return to  our user: function onError error  {     var errReason;        switch error.code  {         case 0:             errReason = 'The camera failed to capture   video.';         break;         case 1:            errReason = 'The video capture application is   currently busy with another request.';         break;         case 2:            errReason = 'An invalid parameter was sent to   the API.';         break;         case 3:            errReason = 'You left the video capture   application without recording anything.';         break;         case 4:            errReason = 'Your device does not support the   video capture request.';         break;     }     alert 'The following error occurred: ' + errReason ; }  116  www.it-ebooks.info   13.  If we run our  application and press the button, the device's default video recording   application will open, and we can record our video, as shown in this screenshot:  14.  Once we have finished recording, our application will receive the video data from the   callback method and output it, like this:  How it works... The Capture object, available through the media-capture API, grants us access to the media  capture capabilities of the device. By specifying the media type that we wish to capture by  calling the captureVideo method, an asynchronous call is made to the device's native   video recording application.  In this example, we  forced the method to request two video captures by setting the limit  property in the optional configuration options—the default value for this limit is set to 1.  117  www.it-ebooks.info   The request is returned when one of these two things happens:   f The maximum number of recordings have been created  f The user exits the native video recording application  Following a successful callback from the request operation, we receive an array of objects.  This array contains properties for each individual media file, which contains the following  properties that we can read:   f name: A DOMString that contains the name of the file  f fullPath: A DOMString that contains the full path of the file  f type: A DOMString that includes the MIME type of the returned media file  f lastModifiedTime: A Date object that contains the date and time at which    the file was last modified   f size: A Number that contains the size of the file in bytes  To find out more  about the captureVideo capabilities offered  by the PhoneGap API, check out the official documentation  at http:  plugins.cordova.io  package org. apache.cordova.media-capture.  Loading a photograph from the device  camera roll library Different devices will store saved photographs in different locations, typically in either a photo  library or a saved photo album. The camera plugin API gives developers the ability to select or  specify from which location an image should be retrieved.  How to do it... We must use the getPicture method, available from the Camera object, to either select an  image from the device library, or capture a new image directly from the camera:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named cameraroll by running this command:  phonegap create cameraroll com.myapp.cameraroll cameraroll  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  118  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Add the media and file-transfer plugins by running the following commands:  cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-media  cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file-transfer  4.  Open www index.html. Let's clean up the unnecessary elements. We will use   jQuery Mobile, so we need to make a reference:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <script type="text javascript" src="jquery jquery- 1.8.0.min.js">           Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                5.  The body of our application will contain four elements. We'll need to provide two  buttons, both with the class attribute set to photo, and each of them with the   id attribute set to cameraPhoto and libraryPhoto respectively.  6.  We also need to create a div element with id set to message, and an img tag    with id set to image:  Take New   Photo     Select From   Library          119  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  Create a new script tag block within the head of the document, and include the  event listener that will fire when the PhoneGap native code is compiled and ready.  Below this, we will create the onDeviceReady function, within which we will apply   a bind handler to the buttons using the jQuery class selector.  8.  Depending on the value of the selected button's id attribute, the switch statement   will run the particular method to obtain the image: function onDeviceReady   {     $ '.photo' .bind 'touchstart', function   {         switch  $ this .attr 'id'   {             case 'cameraPhoto':                 capturePhoto  ;                 break;             case 'libraryPhoto':                 getPhoto  ;                 break;         }     } ; }  9.  Let's now add the first of our image capture functions—capturePhoto. This function   calls the getPicture method from the Camera object. Here, we are asking for the  highest quality image returned and a scaled image to match the provided sizes: function capturePhoto   {     navigator.camera.getPicture onSuccess, onFail, {         quality: 100,         targetWidth: 250,         targetHeight: 250     } ; }  10.  The second image capture method is getPhoto. In this method, we call the   getPicture method once again, but this time, we pass the sourceType option  value to request that the image be selected from the device photo library: function getPhoto   {     navigator.camera.getPicture onSuccess, onFail, {         quality: 100,         destinationType: Camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI,         sourceType: Camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY,         targetWidth: 250,         targetHeight: 250     } ; }  120  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  Finally, let's add the success and error handlers, which will be used by both of our   capture methods. The onSuccess method will display the returned image, setting it  as the source for the image element: function onSuccess imageURI  {     $ 'image' .attr 'src', imageURI ;     $ 'message' .html 'Image location: ' + imageURI ; }  function onFail message  {     $ 'message' .html message ; }  12. Upon running the application on the device, the output will look something like what   is shown here:  How it works... The Camera object, available through the camera plugin API, allows us to interact with  the default camera application on the device. The Camera object itself contains only one  method—getPicture. Depending on the sourceType value being sent through the  capture request method, we can obtain the image either from the device camera or by  selecting a saved image from the photo library or photo album.  In this example, we retrieved the URI for the image to use it as the source for an img tag.   This method can also return the image as a Base64-encoded image, if requested.  There are a number of optional parameters that we can send to the  method calls to customize the camera settings. For detailed information  about each parameter, refer to the official documentation available at  http:  plugins.cordova.io  package org.apache. cordova.camera.  121  www.it-ebooks.info   There's more... In this recipe, we requested that the images be scaled to match a certain dimension,   while maintaining the aspect ratio. When selecting an image from the library or saved   album, PhoneGap resizes the image and stores it in a temporary cache directory on the  device. While this means that resizing is as painless as we would want it to be, the image   may not persist, or it will be overwritten when the next image is resized.  If you want to save resized images in a permanent location after creating them, make sure  that you check out the recipes within this book on how to interact with the local filesystem   and how to save files.  Now that we can easily obtain an image from the device, there are a number of things we can  do with it. For an example, take a look at the next recipe in this chapter.  See also   f The Uploading a file on a remote server recipe in Chapter 3, Filesystems, Storage,   and Local Databases  Applying an effect to an image using canvas Capturing a photo on our device is fantastic, but what all can we do with an image once we  have it in our application? In this recipe, we'll create some simple functions to edit the color   of an image without altering the original source.  How to do it... We must create and use the HTML5 canvas element to load and edit the values of a stored  image, by performing the following steps:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named cameraeffect by running the   following command: phonegap create cameraeffect com.myapp.cameraeffect cameraeffect  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  122  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. We will use jQuery,   so we have to make a reference:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <script type="text javascript" src="jquery jquery- 1.8.0.min.js">           Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                4.   Include a reference to the rgb.js file that is available in the project download that  accompanies this book, below the Cordova JavaScript reference. This contains the  required array of variables for one of our image manipulation functions:          5.  The body of our application will hold three button elements, each with a specific   id attribute that we will reference within the custom code. We'll also need an img   tag with the id attribute set to sourceImage, which will display the original image  that we want to manipulate.  6.  Finally, we need to include a canvas element with the id attribute set to myCanvas:   Grayscale   Sepia   Reset    <img id="sourceImage" src="awesome.jpg" alt="source image"   height="150" width="150"  >  123  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  Let's start adding our custom code. We will use the script tag block before the   closing body tag, into which we'll add our event listener to ensure that PhoneGap   is fully loaded before we proceed. We'll also create some required global variables: document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady, true ;  var canvas,         context,         image,         imgObj,         noise = 20;  8.  Create the onDeviceReady method, which will run once the native code is ready.   Here, we  want to run a method called reset. It will restore our canvas to its default  source. We'll also bind the touchstart handlers to our three buttons, each of which  will run its own method: function onDeviceReady   {     reset  ;      $ 'grayscale' .bind 'touchstart', function   {         grayscaleImage  ;     } ;      $ 'sepia' .bind 'touchstart', function   {         processSepia  ;     } ;      $ 'reset' .bind 'touchstart', function   {         reset  ;     } ; }  source from our starting image to it: function reset   {     canvas = document.getElementById 'myCanvas' ;     context = canvas.getContext "2d" ;     image = document.getElementById 'sourceImage' ;     context.drawImage image, 0, 0 ; }  9.  The reset method creates the canvas reference and its context, and applies the   124  www.it-ebooks.info   10.  Our first image manipulation function is called grayscaleImage. Let's include it  now. Within it, we'll loop through the pixel data of our image, which we can retrieve  from the canvas element using the getImageData method: function grayscaleImage   {     var imageData = context.getImageData 0, 0, 300, 300 ;     for  var i = 0, n = imageData.data.length; i < n; i +=   4  {         var grayscale = imageData.data[i] * .3 +             imageData.data[i + 1] * .59 + imageData.data[i   + 2] * .11;         imageData.data[i] = grayscale;         imageData.data[i + 1] = grayscale;         imageData.data[i + 2] = grayscale;     }     context.putImageData imageData, 0, 0 ; }  11.  Our second manipulation function is called processSepia. Once again, we will   obtain the image data from our canvas element and loop through each pixel,  applying the changes as we go: function processSepia   {     var imageData =         context.getImageData 0, 0, canvas.width,   canvas.height ;     for  var i = 0; i < imageData.data.length; i += 4  {         imageData.data[i] = r[imageData.data[i]];         imageData.data[i + 1] = g[imageData.data[i + 1]];         imageData.data[i + 2] = b[imageData.data[i + 2]];         if  noise > 0  {             var noise = Math.round noise - Math.random   *   noise ;             for  var j = 0; j < 3; j++  {                 var iPN = noise + imageData.data[i + j];                 imageData.data[i + j] =  iPN > 255  ? 255 :   iPN;             }         }     }     context.putImageData imageData, 0, 0 ; };  125  www.it-ebooks.info   12. Upon running the application on the device after selecting a button to change    our default image, the output will look something like what is shown in the   following screenshot:  How it works... When we start  processing a change to the canvas image, we first obtain the data using  the getImageData method, which is available through the canvas context. We can easily  access the information for each pixel within the returned image object and its data attribute.  With the data in an array, we can loop over each pixel object first, and then over each value  within each pixel object.  Pixels contain four values: the red, green, blue, and alpha channels.  By looping over each color channel in each pixel, we can alter the values, thereby changing  the image. We can then set the revised image as the source in our canvas, using the  putImageData method to set it back to the context of our canvas.  126  www.it-ebooks.info   There's more... Although this recipe does not involve any PhoneGap-specific code with the exception of the  onDeviceReady method, it was included here for three reasons:   f As an example to show you how you might like to work with images captured using   the camera plugin API   f To remind you of or introduce you to the power of HTML5 elements, and demonstrate   how you can work with the canvas   f Because it's pretty cool!  Playing a remote video In reach media mobile applications, we are often required to play videos from a remote  source. PhoneGap can play remote videos by two ways: a plugin or a web API. The simpler   way is by using a web API.  How to do it... Playing a video using PhoneGap can be done by using the HTML5 video tag:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named remotevideo by running this command:  phonegap create remotevideo com.myapp.remotevideo  remotevideo  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Open www index.html. Let's clean up the unnecessary elements. So, we have the   following code:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >  127  www.it-ebooks.info            Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                4.  Let's add the video tag that holds the URL of the video. We will be using a sample   video from http:  w3schools.com:                 <source   src="http:  www.w3schools.com tags movie.mp4"   type="video mp4">         <source   src="http:  www.w3schools.com tags movie.ogg"   type="video ogg">          5.  Running the application on the device will give us the following result:  128  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... The video tag on a PhoneGap application works just as on a web application. We add a  reference to the video URL using the source tag. We can also use other video attributes  such as control to display or hide the video control.  129  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   5  Working with Your  Contacts List  In this chapter, we will cover these recipes:   f Listing all available contacts  f Displaying the contact information of a specific individual  f Creating and saving a new contact  Introduction With ever-expanding and increasing technological resources and advancements, mobile  devices contain increasingly powerful processors and provide users and consumers with   an impressive array of features.  Above all the apps, widgets, and features that your device can manage, let's not forget that  the primary function of a mobile device  certainly a mobile phone  is to hold the contact  information of your friends, family, or favorite local takeaway restaurants.  All the recipes in this chapter will focus on interacting with your device's contact database   and how you can list, display, and add contacts into it.  131  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing all available contacts Developers can access, read from, and filter the contacts saved within the device's contact  database, allowing them to query and work with the address book on the device.  How to do it... We will create an application to read all contacts in the device database and output them as   a list:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named readcontact by running the   following command: phonegap create readcontact com.myapp.readcontact readcontact  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the contact plugins by running this command:  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.contacts  4.  Open www index.html, and let's clean up the unnecessary elements. We will be   using jQuery Mobile, so we have to make a reference:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"   href="jquery jquery.mobile.min.css"  >                                Hello World         132  www.it-ebooks.info                  <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                5.  Let's add the initial page for our application within the body of the HTML    document. Here, we will create the page div element with the id attribute set   to contacts-home:                   My Contacts                                    6.  Within the content div element, create a new unordered list block. Set the id  attribute to contactList, data-role to listview, and the data-inset  attribute to true:          7.  With the HTML UI complete, let's now focus on creating the custom code to interact   with the contacts. Create a new script tag block before the body close of the  document, and include the event listener to check whether the device is ready,   as well as the callback method the it will run—onDeviceReady:       document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   false ;      function onDeviceReady   {  133  www.it-ebooks.info           getAllContacts  ;     }    8.  The application will execute the getAllContacts method, which will read from  the device's contacts database. To achieve this, we'll set the optional multiple  parameter of contactFindOptions to true so that we get multiple contacts.  The multiple parameter is set to false by default,  which will return only one contact.  9.  We then set the required contactFields parameter to specify which fields should   be returned in each Contact object.  10.  Finally, we call the find   method, passing the fields, the options, and the success   and error callback method names: function getAllContacts   {     var options = new ContactFindOptions  ;     options.filter = "";     options.multiple = true;     var fields = ["name", "phoneNumbers",         "birthday", "emails"     ];     navigator.contacts.find fields,         onAllSuccess, onError, options ; }  11.  Following a successful response, the onAllSuccess method will return an   array of Contact objects for us to work with. We will initially loop over the  returned results and push each Contact object into a new array object, called  arrContactDetails, which allows us to sort the results alphabetically. If no results  are returned, we'll output a user-friendly message: function onAllSuccess contacts  {      if  contacts.length  {          var arrContactDetails = new Array  ;         for  var i = 0; i < contacts.length; ++i  {             if  contacts[i].name  {                 arrContactDetails.push contacts[i] ;             }  134  www.it-ebooks.info           }          arrContactDetails.sort alphabeticalSort ;             more code to go here      } else {         $ 'contactList' .append '  Sorry,             no contacts were found    ' ;         }         $ 'contactList' .listview "refresh" ;     } }  order using the formatted version of the name: function alphabeticalSort a, b  {     if  a.name.formatted < b.name.formatted  {         return -1;     } else if  a.name.formatted > b.name.formatted  {         return 1;     } else {         return 0;     } }  12. Include the alphabeticalSort function, which will sort each contact in ascending   13.  To create our contact list, the following code will go directly beneath the   arrContactDetails.sort alphabeticalSort  call in the code. This will loop  over the sorted array and create the list items for each contact, setting the Contact  object ID and the formatted name in each list item. It will also create the list divider to  differentiate each group of contacts by the first letter of the name: var alphaHeader = arrContactDetails[0].name.formatted[0]; for  var i = 0; i < arrContactDetails.length; ++i  {     var contactObject = arrContactDetails[i];     if  alphaHeader != contactObject.name.formatted[0]  {         alphaHeader = contactObject.name.formatted[0];         $ 'contactList' .append ' ' +  alphaHeader + ' ' ;         $ 'contactList' .append              '<li class="contact_list_item" id="' +             contactObject.id + '"> '   +             contactObject.name.formatted + '  ' +  135  www.it-ebooks.info               contactObject.id + '   '          ;     } else {         if  i == 0  {             $ 'contactList' .append                  ' ' +   alphaHeader + ' ' ;         }         $ 'contactList' .append              '<li class="contact_list_item" id="' +   contactObject.id + '"> ' +             contactObject.name.formatted + '  ' +             contactObject.id + '   ' ;     } }  14.  Finally, we include the onError callback method, which will run if we encounter any   issues obtaining data from the find   method: function onError error  {     alert 'An error has occurred: ' + error.code ; }  15.  Upon running the application on a device, we will see the populated list somewhat   like this:  136  www.it-ebooks.info   Next to each name in the list, we can see the ID of the contact as  used in the device's contact database. This value is also set in the id  attribute of each list item.  How it works... The contacts.find   method available from the contact plugin API is designed to query  the device's contacts database to obtain and return an array of Contact objects. We set the  contact fields in the required parameter of the function, which acts as a search qualifier for  the transaction. Only the fields that we set in the contactFields parameter will be included  as properties of the returned Contact objects. Using this parameter, we can choose exactly  what details we want to obtain from the request for each contact.  Following a successful result from the find   method, an array of Contact objects is  passed to the success callback method. Once we have received this information, we loop over  the array to output the alphabetically sorted information in our unordered list, making use of  the jQuery Mobile framework's listview item for clear display.  For a comprehensive look at the methods and properties available for use through the  Contact object, refer to the official documentation at http:  plugins.cordova.io   package org.apache.cordova.contacts.  There's more… In this example, we specifically set the values for the contactFields parameter to return in  each Contact object. If this were left blank, we would receive only the id property of each  contact. If we want to receive all available properties for each contact, we can set the value   to a wildcard asterisk  * .  Displaying the contact information for a  specific individual Working with the contact database, developers can easily obtain a full array of all Contact  objects saved on the device. We want to be able to obtain and view the saved contact  information for specific individuals if we choose to drill down and filter a certain contact   from the database.  137  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting ready For this recipe, we'll build on the code created in the previous recipe, Listing all available  contacts. This will give us a head start to add more functionality to the application. Therefore,  if you haven't yet completed the previous recipe, Listing all available contacts, it may help to  complete it first.  How it works… To manage the selected contact information, we will first make use of the localStorage API  available and harness some more power from the jQuery Mobile framework:  1.  When the user selects a contact from the list, we want to take them to a new page to   show the details. Let's add a new page to index.html below the current one. 2.  Set a new div element with the data-role attribute set to page and the id   attribute set to contact-info. Within this, we will add our page header with the id  attribute set to contact_header. We will also include a back button. It will take the  user back to the original page by referencing the ID in the link.  3.  We will keep the H1 tag empty as we'll populate it with the contact's name:                   <a href="contacts-home" id="back" data-icon="back"   data-direction="reverse">Back                       4.  Below the page header, we create a content div element with the id attribute set  to contact_content. It contains four form field items, which will display the given  name, family name, phone number, and e-mail address for the chosen contact:                   First Name:          <input type="text" name="givenName" id="givenName"   disabled  >                      Last Name:   138  www.it-ebooks.info           <input type="text" name="familyName"   id="familyName" disabled  >                      Phone:          <input type="text" name="phone" id="phone" disabled    >                      Email:          <input type="text" name="email" id="email" disabled    >           5.  At the top of the custom JavaScript code, create a global variable to reference the   localStorage API. We'll also include a global variable called contactInfo, which  we will use to hold data later on:     var localStorage    =   window.localStorage;   var contactInfo;    document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,   false ;  6.  Let's now amend the onAllSuccess method, which writes the list of all contacts.   Within the loop, we'll add a small portion of code that will add each item to  localStorage. Here, we will store the entire contact object for each listing, and use  the ID for each contact as the key that we can use to retrieve the information: var alphaHeader = arrContactDetails[0].name.formatted[0]; for  var i = 0; i < arrContactDetails.length; ++i  {     var contactObject = arrContactDetails[i];     if  alphaHeader != contactObject.name.formatted[0]  {         alphaHeader = contactObject.name.formatted[0];         $ 'contactList' .append ' ' +  alphaHeader + ' ' ;         $ 'contactList' .append              '<li class="contact_list_item" id="' +             contactObject.id + '"> '   +             contactObject.name.formatted + '  ' +             contactObject.id + '   '          ;  139  www.it-ebooks.info       } else {         if  i == 0  {             $ 'contactList' .append                  ' ' +   alphaHeader + ' ' ;         }         $ 'contactList' .append              '<li class="contact_list_item" id="' +   contactObject.id + '"> ' +             contactObject.name.formatted + '  ' +             contactObject.id + '   ' ;     }      localStorage.setItem          contactObject.id,JSON.stringify contactObject       ; }  The localStorage API saves data as a key value pair  and can only contain strings. As such, we convert the object  to a string before saving it. For more information, check out  the Caching content using the local storage API recipe in  Chapter 3, Filesystems, Storage, and Local Databases.  7.  Each of our generated list items references a particular contact. We have stored the  specific ID for each contact as an attribute in each list item. Create an event handler  that will obtain the value of the contact ID from the selected list item, and pass it to  the getContactByID method: $ document .on 'click', 'contactList   li.contact_list_item', function   {      var selectedID = $ this .attr 'id' ;     getContactByID selectedID ;  } ;  8.  Let's now add the getContactByID function, which accepts the selected ID of the   contact as a required parameter. This will obtain the selected contact information  from localStorage and assign it to the contactInfo variable, which we set  earlier. It will then take the user to a new page within the application: function getContactByID contactID  {     contactInfo =   JSON.parse localStorage.getItem contactID  ;  140  www.it-ebooks.info       $.mobile.changePage $ 'contact-info'  ; }  9.  We now have the contact information stored, but we need to populate the form   fields on the information page with the details. Let's add a new event handler to the  code to detect a jQuery Mobile pagechange event, which will run a method called  onPageChange: $ document .bind "pagechange", onPageChange ;  10.  The onPageChange function will obtain the id attribute of the page that we have   changed to. If it matches contact-info, we will first clear the values of all the form  fields, and then set each one with the details from the contactInfo object. We will  also set the H1 tag in the header with the contact name: function onPageChange event, data  {     var toPageId = data.toPage.attr "id" ;     switch  toPageId  {         case 'contact-info':              clearValues  ;              $ 'contact_header h1'                  .html contactInfo.name.formatted ; $ 'givenName' .val contactInfo.name.givenName ; $ 'familyName' .val contactInfo.name.familyName ;  $ 'phone' .val contactInfo.phoneNumbers[0].value ;             $ 'email' .val contactInfo.emails[0].value ;  11.  Finally, let's add the clearValues function, which will reset all form fields on the               break;     } }  page where the input type is text: function clearValues   {     $ 'input[type=text]' .each function   {         $ '' + this.id + '' .val '' ;     } ; }  141  www.it-ebooks.info   12. When we run the application on the device and select a contact, the resulting page   will look like this:  How it works... In this recipe, we extended the previous code to fulfill the desired functionality. We amended  the initial code when we looped over the returned array of Contact objects, and added some  code to set each Contact object in the localStorage database available on the device,  using its ID property as the key for the storage entry.  When a contact was selected from the list, we were able to use that list item's ID attribute  to obtain the saved Contact object from localStorage before taking the user to the next  page using the jQuery Mobile framework's mobile.changePage   function.  With the Contact object stored in an accessible variable, we were then able to read the  properties set within it and output them to the user.   f The Caching content using the local storage API recipe of Chapter 3, Filesystems,   Storage, and Local Databases  See also  142  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating and saving a new contact Having an address book or an application that can read contact information from the  database is fantastic, but wouldn't it be even better if we could add contacts to the database?  The good news is that the PhoneGap API not only provides a way to read the information, but  also gives developers an incredibly powerful yet easy way to add information.  Getting ready For this recipe, we'll build on the code created in the previous recipe, Displaying the contact  information of a specific individual. This will give us a head start to add more functionality into  the application. Therefore, if you haven't yet completed the previous recipe, Displaying the  contact information of a specific individual, it would be a good idea to complete it first.  How to do it... To store a new contact in the device database, we will create a form and save the new  information in a Contact object:  1.  Firstly, let's edit the default loading page for our application to include a button that   will take the user to a new page to add a contact:                   My Contacts           Add         2.  Now let's create the new page. It will enable the user to input new contact  information. Create a new jQuery Mobile page and set the id attribute to   contact-add.  3.  Within the header div element, we add a new link that will take the user back to the   home page, bypassing the save functionality that we will shortly be adding:                  <a href="contacts-home" id="back" data-icon="back"   data-direction="reverse">Back           Add Contact   143  www.it-ebooks.info                           4.  Within the content div element block, we will add a new form element with the id   attribute set to new_contact_form. It contains a number of form field items. These  will be used to enter the new information about the contact's given name, family  name, phone number, and e-mail address.  5.  The last form field block contains an input button with the id attribute set to  saveBtn, which we'll reference via jQuery code to perform the save process.  6.  Finally, we also include a hidden form item called displayName. We will populate   this value after the form has been submitted, and will use it to store in the new  Contact object:                  First Name:          <input type="text" name="givenName" id="givenName"    >                      Last Name:                                 Phone:                                 Email:                                <input type="button" name="saveBtn" id="saveBtn"   value="Save Contact"  >         <input type="hidden" name="displayName"   id="displayName"  >          144  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  With the layout and UI for the page complete, let's now focus on the JavaScript   functionality for processing the new contact information. Amend the onPageChange  function to add a new case within the switch statement to check for the page's id  value contact-add. If it matches, everything within this case statement will be  executable within that page context.  8.  Firstly, we'll bind a touchstart event to the saveBtn button element, which will   commence the saving process: case 'contact-add':      $ 'saveBtn' .bind 'touchstart', function   {      } ;      break;  9.  We can now populate the value of the displayName hidden form field by   concatenating the values from the givenName and familyName form fields  provided: $ 'saveBtn' .bind 'touchstart', function   {     $ 'displayName' .val          $ 'new_contact_form givenName' .val   + ' ' +   $ 'new_contact_form familyName' .val        ;  } ;  10.  Before we can create the new Contact object, we must set the submitted   information in the required format, and then we can send it as a parameter. The  information is accepted in the form of a structural object containing key value pairs.  We can call each form field individually to create this, but in doing so, we would have  a tightly coupled dependency on the specific form fields.  11.  Here, we can make use of the jQuery library and create a serialized array of all the   form fields within the form, which we have referenced by its id attribute.  Serialized array means encoding a set of form elements as  an array of names and values. For more information about  serialized arrays, refer to https:  api.jquery.com  serializeArray .  145  www.it-ebooks.info   12. We then loop over the array to create the key value pairs  as expected  to return the   structure of the information. Within the loop, we have set a switch statement to  check for the name of the submitted form value. PhoneGap manages e-mails and  phone numbers in a separate way from standard name contact fields. If they exist,   we set them using a new ContactField object: var arrContactInfo =   $ 'new_contact_form' .serializeArray  ;  var phoneNumbers = new Array  ; var emails = new Array  ;  var contactInfo = '{';  for  var i = 0; i < arrContactInfo.length; i++  {     switch  arrContactInfo[i].name  {         case 'phone':             if  arrContactInfo[i].value  {                 phoneNumbers[0] =                     new ContactField 'mobile',                         arrContactInfo[i].value, true ;             }             break;         case 'email':             if  arrContactInfo[i].value  {                 emails[0] =                     new ContactField 'work',                         arrContactInfo[i].value, true ;             }             break;         default:             contactInfo += '"' + arrContactInfo[i].name +   '" : "' + arrContactInfo[i].value + '"';             if  i < arrContactInfo.length - 1  {                 contactInfo += ', '             }     } }  contactInfo += '}';  13.  Next, we create a new Contact object and pass the contactInfo variable that we   just created before saving the contact in the device's database: var newContact =   navigator.contacts.create JSON.parse contactInfo  ;  newContact.phoneNumbers = phoneNumbers;  146  www.it-ebooks.info   newContact.emails = emails;  newContact.save onSaveSuccess, onError ;  14.  While defining the save   method, we also include two callback methods to handle   the successful save or any errors that may have arisen from the process. In the  onSaveSuccess function, we will take the user back to the home page using the  jQuery Mobile framework's built-in changePage method.  15.  We will then refresh the contactList list element to show the new data stored   within the device's database: function onSaveSuccess contact  {     $.mobile.changePage $ 'contacts-home'  ;     $ 'contactList' .listview "refresh" ; }  16.  When we run the application on the device, the home page would look like this, with   the new Add button:  147  www.it-ebooks.info   17.  By choosing to add a new contact, the user will be presented with the new form page,   as follows:  18.  Finally, once the submission has been done, the user is taken back to the home page   listing all contacts. It now shows the new contact, created and saved in the device  database, like this:  148  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... When we create a new Contact object, we are simply creating a local variable populated with  the information provided from the form submission. At this point, we can still add and amend  properties within the Contact object, or simply fail to persist the object by not saving it.  To successfully save and store the contact within the device contact database, we then call  the save   method, available from the Contact object.  The following methods are available for use from the Contact object:   f save  : This method will save a new contact in the device contacts database. If the  Contact object has an id attribute that already matches that of a saved contact, it  will update the saved contact with any revised information.   f remove  : Calling this method will remove the specified contact from the device   contacts database.   f clone  : This method will create a deep copy of the provided Contact object.   However, the id property will be set to null. This means that you can easily  duplicate contact information and save it as a new Contact object.  There's more... When we saved the e-mail address and phone number in the new Contact object, we used  the ContactField object to do so instead of sending the values as part of the contact  information object. The ContactField object is provided to support generic fields within a  Contact object, such as e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and URLs.  The Contact object itself stores values such as these in an array, which can contain multiple  ContactField objects—a contact can have more than one phone number assigned to it,   for instance.  The ContactField object requires the following properties:   f type: This is a DOMString that identifies which type of field this is. For example,  a phone number type value can include home, work, mobile, or any other value  supported by the database on a particular device platform.   f value: This is a DOMString that holds the value of the field itself, for example, the   phone number or e-mail address.   f pref: This is a Boolean value that, if set to true, will set the specific field as the   preferred value for the ContactField type.  149  www.it-ebooks.info   In our example application in this recipe, we stored only  one phone number and one e-mail address per contact.  We created a new array for each value in which to hold  this information, but only set the first index in each array  with a ContactField object. Why not expand on this recipe to provide the user with  a frontend UI that allows more form fields  in order to  provide extra phone numbers , and then amend the code  to create new ContactField objects for every new  value submitted?  150  www.it-ebooks.info   6  Hooking into   Native Events  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   f Pausing your application  f Resuming your application  f Displaying the status of the device battery levels  f Displaying network connection status  f Creating a custom submenu  Introduction When developing applications for mobile devices, we can create feature-rich applications that  harness the functionality of the native processes and systems.  The devices themselves provide us with built-in controls and user interface elements in the  form of native buttons, to which we can apply methods and functions.  We can also make use of the hidden events and manage how our applications will work when  placed in the background of the device, or we can also alter states depending on network  connectivity.  The recipes in this chapter will introduce you to some of the native events available through  the PhoneGap API and how we can implement them in applications.  151  www.it-ebooks.info   Pausing your application Although we want our users to spend their time solely on our application, they will inevitably  leave our application to open another one or do something else entirely. We need to be able   to detect when a user has left our application but not closed it down entirely.  How to do it... We can use the PhoneGap API to fire off a particular event when our application is in the  background of the device:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named pausedemo by running the    following command: phonegap create pausedemo com.myapp.pausedemo pausedemo  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Open www index.html and let's clean up unnecessary elements. So we will have   the following:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >          Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                152  www.it-ebooks.info   4.  Before the closing the body tag, add the event listener inside the script tag block   to check when the device is ready and the PhoneGap code is ready to run:       document.addEventListener "deviceready",         onDeviceReady, false ;    5.  Create the onDeviceReady function, which will run when the event listener is fired.   Inside this, we'll create a new event listener that will check for a pause event, and  once received, this will fire the onPause method: function onDeviceReady   {     document.addEventListener "pause", onPause, false ; }  6.  Let's create the onPause method. In this example application, we'll ask the device   by playing an audio beep to notify the user that the application has moved to the  background. The numeric parameter specifies how many times we want the audio  notification to be played—in this case, just once: function onPause   {     navigator.notification.beep 1 ; }  Developing for iOS? There is no native beep API for iOS. The PhoneGap API  will play an audio file using the media API, but the developer must provide  the file named beep.wav in the  www directory of the application project  files. This file should be under 30 seconds in length. iOS will also ignore   the beep count argument and will play the audio once. In Windows 7 mobile,  the WP7 Cordova library contains a generic beep audio file that will be used  if the application is developed for this OS.  7.  When running the application on the device, if you press the home button or navigate   to another application, the device will play the notification audio.  How it works... To correctly determine the flow of our lifecycle events, we have first set up the deviceready  event listener to ensure that the native code was properly loaded. At this point, we were then  able to set the new event listener for the pause event.  As soon as the user navigates away from our application, the native code would set the  application as a background processes on the device and fire the pause event, at which   point our listener would run the onPause method.  153  www.it-ebooks.info   To find out more about the pause event, refer to the official documentation available here:  http:  docs.phonegap.com en 3.6.0 cordova_events_events.md.htmlpause  There's more... In this recipe, we applied the pause event in an incredibly simple manner. There is a possibility  that your application will want to do something specific other than sending an audio notification  when the user pauses your application.  For example, you may want to save and persist any data currently in the view or in memory,   such as any draft work  if dealing with form inputs  or saving responses from a remote API call.  We'll build an example that will persist data in the next recipe, as we'll be able to quantify its  success when we resume the use of the application and bring it back to the foreground.  Resuming your application Multi-tasking capabilities that are now available on mobile devices specify that the user   has the ability to switch from one application to another at any time. We need to handle   this possibility and ensure that we can save and restore any process and data when the   user returns to our application.  How to do it... We can use the PhoneGap API to detect when our application is brought back to the  foreground of the device:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named resumedemo by running the    following command: phonegap create resumedemo com.myapp.resumedemo resumedemo  2.  Add a devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Open www index.html and let's clean up unnecessary elements. We'll also be   manipulating the DOM elements, so include a reference to the xui.js file within   the head tag. We will also be setting the deviceready listener once the DOM has  fully loaded, so let's apply an onload attribute to the body tag:            154  www.it-ebooks.info                     <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <script type="text javascript"   src="js xui.js">           Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">           4.  Create a new script tag block before the closing body tag and add the   deviceready event listener within the onLoad method. We'll also set two   global variables, savedTime and localStorage; the latter of which will   reference the localStorage API on the device:       var savedTime;     var localStorage    =   window.localStorage;      function onLoad   {             document.addEventListener "deviceready",             onDeviceReady, false ;     }    5.  Create the onDeviceReady function, within which we'll set the two event listeners    to check for the pause and resume events: function onDeviceReady   {     document.addEventListener "pause", onPause, false ;     document.addEventListener "resume", onResume, false ; }  6.  We can now add the first of the new callback functions for the added listeners.  onPause will run when a pause event has been detected. In this method, we'll  create a new date variable holding the current time and store it in the global  savedTime variable we created earlier.  155  www.it-ebooks.info   7.   If the user has entered something in the text input field, we'll take this value also and  send it to the localStorage API before clearing out the input field: function onPause   {     savedTime = new Date  ;     var strInput = x$ 'userInput' .attr 'value' ;     if strInput  {         localStorage.setItem 'saved_input', strInput ;         x$ 'userInput' .attr 'value', '' ;     } }  8.  Define the onResume method, which will run when a resume event has been   detected. In this function, we'll save a new date variable and we'll use it in  conjunction with the savedTime variable created in the onPause method to  generate the time difference between the two dates. We'll then create a string  message to display the time details to the user.  9.  We'll then check localStorage for the existence of an item stored using the   saved_input key. If this exists, we'll extend the message string and append the  saved user input value before sending the message to the DOM to display: function onResume   {     var currentTime = new Date  ;     var dateDiff = currentTime.getTime   -   savedTime.getTime  ;     var objDiff = new Object  ;     objDiff.days = Math.floor dateDiff   1000   60   60     24 ;     dateDiff -= objDiff.days * 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;     objDiff.hours = Math.floor dateDiff   1000   60   60 ;     dateDiff -= objDiff.hours * 1000 * 60 * 60;     objDiff.minutes = Math.floor dateDiff   1000   60 ;     dateDiff -= objDiff.minutes * 1000 * 60;     objDiff.seconds = Math.floor dateDiff   1000 ;      var strMessage = ' You are back! '     strMessage += ' You left me in the background for '     strMessage += ' ' + objDiff.days + '  days, '     strMessage += ' ' + objDiff.hours + '  hours, '     strMessage += ' ' + objDiff.minutes + '  minutes,   '     strMessage += ' ' + objDiff.seconds + '    seconds. ';  156  www.it-ebooks.info       if  localStorage.getItem 'saved_input'   {         strMessage = strMessage + ' You had typed the   following before you left:  '         strMessage += '" ' +   localStorage.getItem 'saved_input'  + ' " ';     }      x$ 'message' .html strMessage ;  }  10.  Finally, let's add the DOM elements to the application. Create a new div element  with the id attribute set to message, and an input text element with the id set   to userInput:                  11.  If we run the application on the device, the initial output would provide the user with   an input box to enter text, should they wish to:  157  www.it-ebooks.info   12. If we were to pause the application and then resume it after some time, the display   would then update to look something like this:  How it works... We have set up the deviceready event listener after the DOM was fully loaded, which would  then run the onDeviceReady function. Within this method, we then added two new event  listeners to catch the pause and resume events respectively.  When the application was paused and placed in the background processes of the device,   we saved the current date and time in a global variable. We also checked for the existence  of any user-supplied input, and if it was present, we saved it using the localStorage  capabilities of the device.  When the application was resumed and placed back in the foreground of the device, the  onResume method was run, which obtained the time difference between the saved and  current datetime values to output to the user. We also retrieved the saved user input from  localStorage, if we had set it within the onPause method.  To find out more about the resume event, refer to the official  documentation available here: http:  docs.phonegap.com  en 3.6.0 cordova_events_events.md.htmlresume.  158  www.it-ebooks.info   Displaying the status of the device   battery levels Progression in capabilities and processing power means we can do much more with our  mobile devices including multitasking and background processes. This often means we   end up using more battery power to fuel our applications.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will build an application to display the connection details and the current  power capacity of the device battery:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named batterystatus by running    the following: phonegap create batterystatus com.myapp.batterystatus  batterystatus  2.  Add a devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both using the   following command: cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  We will use a battery-status plugin:  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.battery-status  4.  Open www index.html and let's clean up unnecessary elements. We'll also   manipulate the DOM elements, so include a reference to the xui.js file within   the head tag.  5.  We will be calling the onDeviceReady method to instantiate the PhoneGap   functionality through an onLoad   function attached to the body tag:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >  159  www.it-ebooks.info           <script type="text javascript"   src="js xui.js">           Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                6.  Let's add the UI elements for the application. This will include a div element with   the id attribute set to statusMessage, which will hold our returned information.  We'll also build up some nested elements to create a visual representation of the  device battery.  7.  We will reference the id attributes of each element using the XUI library, so we   need to make sure the three attribute values are set to batteryIndicator,  batteryLevel, and shade respectively:  Battery Status                                  8.  With the DOM elements inserted, let's move on to the JavaScript code. Create a  script tag block before the closing head tag and add an onLoad method that   is run from the body tag, which will add the event listener to check whether the  native PhoneGap code has been loaded and is ready for use:       function onLoad   {         document.addEventListener "deviceready",           onDeviceReady, false ;       }    160  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  Add the onDeviceReady method, to which we will add three new event listeners  that will respond to the changes in the device's battery status. Each listener has a  corresponding callback method, which we will define in the next few steps: function onDeviceReady   {     window.addEventListener "batterystatus",     onBatteryStatus, false ;     window.addEventListener "batterylow", onBatteryLow,   false ;     window.addEventListener "batterycritical",     onBatteryCritical, false ; }  10.  The first callback method is onBatteryStatus, which accepts the information   object that contains the properties of the device's battery. We will pass this  information to a new function, setBatteryInfo: function onBatteryStatus battery_info  {     setBatteryInfo battery_info ; }  11.  Let's write the setBatteryInfo method called from the status change function.   We can use the level property returned from the battery_info object to set the  width of the batteryLevel element. We'll then create a message with the current  capacity level and stating whether or not the device is plugged in. This message will  be sent to the statusMessage element.  12. If the battery level is below 21 percent, we'll change the background color of the   battery to red, otherwise we'll set it to a healthy green: function setBatteryInfo battery_info  {     x$ 'batteryLevel' .setStyle 'width',         battery_info.level + '%' ;     var statusMessage = ' Percent:  ' +         battery_info.level + '%  ';     statusMessage = statusMessage + ' A C: ' +         chargingStatus battery_info.isPlugged  + ' ';     x$ 'statusMessage' .html statusMessage ;     if  battery_info.level <= 20  {         x$ 'level' .addClass 'warning' ;         x$ 'batteryLevel' .setStyle 'backgroundColor',             'E74A4A' ;     } else {         x$ 'batteryLevel' .setStyle 'backgroundColor',             '01A206' ;     } }  161  www.it-ebooks.info   13.  The return value of the isPlugged value from the battery_info object is a   Boolean value, so we'll send it to a new function to return a string representation   of the connection: function chargingStatus isPlugged  {     if isPlugged  { return 'Connected'; }     return 'Disconnected'; }  14.  The batterylow event handler will run a method called onBatteryLow. Inside this,   we'll include a notification alert to inform the following to the user: function onBatteryLow battery_info  {     navigator.notification.alert          'Time to charge it up!',         function   {},   alert dismissed         'Low Battery',         'OK'      ; }  15.  If the battery reaches critical levels, the onBatteryCritical callback method   will run. Again, let's use this event to alert the user of the urgent need to charge   the device: function onBatteryCritical battery_info  {     navigator.notification.alert          'Seriously, plug your charger in!',         function   {},   alert dismissed         'Critical Battery',         'OK'      ; }  16.  Both our notification alerts will execute an empty function specified as the  alertCallback property in the previous snippets, which will run when   the alert is dismissed. For this example, we don't need to perform any extra  functionality at this point, hence the empty function.  17.  Finally, include some CSS definitions to add a visual presence to our battery elements:    batteryIndicator {     margin: 0 auto;     width: 250px;     height: 100px;     border: 1px solid ccc;  162  www.it-ebooks.info       background: fff;     border-radius: 10px;     overflow: hidden; } batteryLevel {     height: 100%; } shade {     width: 100%;     height: 15px;     background: -webkit-gradient linear, 0% 0%, 0% 100%,   from e5e5e5 , to fff  ;     opacity: 0.2;     position: relative;     top: 15px; } .warning {     color: ff0000;     font-weight: bold; }    18.  When running the application on the device, assuming that the battery levels are   within the healthy boundaries, the output will look similar to this:  163  www.it-ebooks.info   19.  As soon as the device battery capacity goes below 21 percent, the UI will change to   something similar to the following:  20. In this image, the device battery levels have hit the critical value of 5%. As a result,   we notify the user with an alert message:  How it works... Using the onDeviceReady method, we have set up three new event listeners to check for the  status of the device battery levels.  All three battery status handlers  batterystatus, batterylow, and batterycritical   return the same object with the following properties:   f level: Number that defines the percentage of the battery, between 0 and 100  f isPlugged: Boolean that returns a true or false value to represent whether the   device is connected to a charger or not  164  www.it-ebooks.info   We were able to use the returned properties to update a visual representation of the device  battery on screen, as well as use the level property to determine whether we are below the  low threshold barrier.  Although at first glance, the three events seem to do the same thing, there are important  differences. The batterystatus event will detect changes in the battery capacity and will  fire its callback method with every percentage change. This allows us to keep a constant  check on the status of the device battery levels. It will also fire if the device is connected  or disconnected from the charger. From the isPlugged property, we can easily determine  whether the device is using the mains' power or not.  The batterylow event will fire only when the battery has reached a specific percentage   level deemed as low by the device. The same applies to the batterycritical event,   which will only fire once the battery level has reached a particular percentage.  The threshold levels for the batterylow and batterycritical  events are specific to each device, so this is something to be aware  of if you are hardcoding values within the application. As a reference,  Android devices typically set the low threshold to 20 percent and the  critical threshold to 5 percent.  To find out more about the batterycritical, batterylow, and batterystatus events,  refer to the official documentation available here:  https:  github.com apache cordova-plugin-battery-status.  There's more... In our sample application included in this recipe, we processed a simple alert notification  when the low and critical thresholds were reached.  Depending on your mobile application and what its processes are, the chances are that you  will want to do something specific at these points. For example, you may want to save any  user input values to the local memory or shutdown pause certain aspects of the application's  functionality once these thresholds have been detected. If the user is unable to charge their  device, you do not want them to lose data while using your application.  165  www.it-ebooks.info   Displaying network connection status Your application may require the user to be connected to a network. This may be for partial  updates, remote data transfer, or streaming. Using the PhoneGap API and network information  plugin, we can easily detect the status or existence of any network connectivity.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will build an application to constantly check the network connection status  of our device:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named networkinfo by running the   following command: phonegap create networkinfo com.myapp.networkinfo networkinfo  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  We will use the network info plugin as follows:  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.network-information  4.  Open www index.html and let's clean up unnecessary elements. We'll also be   manipulating the DOM elements, so include a reference to the xui.js file within   the head tag.  5.  We will also set the deviceready event listener after the DOM has fully loaded,    so we'll also add the onLoad   function call to the body tag:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <!-- WARNING: for iOS 7, remove the width=device-width and  height=device-height attributes. See   https:  issues.apache.org jira browse CB-4323 -->         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >  166  www.it-ebooks.info           <script type="text javascript"   src="js xui.js">           Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                                6.  Let's add the UI elements to the body of our application. Create a div block to   act as a container for our statusMessage and count elements, both of which  we will reference directly using the XUI library. We will also insert content into the  speedMessage element, so ensure the id attribute of these three elements match  those shown:  Network Status                             7.  Create a new script tag block before the closing body tag and define two global   variables, which we will use within the custom code. We can also now define the  onLoad method, which will set the deviceready event listener:       var intCheck = 0;     var currentType;      function onLoad   {         document.addEventListener "deviceready",             onDeviceReady, false ;     }     167  www.it-ebooks.info   8.  Let's now add the onDeviceready method called from the deviceready event   listener. Within this function, we will add two new event listeners to check when the  device is connected or disconnected from a network. Both of these listeners will run  the same callback method, checkConnection.  9.  We will then set up an interval timer to run the same checkConnection method   every second to provide us with constant updates for the connection: function onDeviceReady   {     document.addEventListener "online", checkConnection,         false ;     document.addEventListener "offline", checkConnection,         false ;     var connCheck = setInterval function   {         checkConnection  ;     }, 1000 ; }  10.  The checkConnection function sets up the objConnection variable to hold    a representation of the device's connection. This object returns a value in the   type property from which we are able to determine the current connection type.   We'll pass this value to another function called getConnectionType, which we'll  use to return a user-friendly string representation of the connection type.  11.  As this method runs every second, we want to be able to determine whether the  current connection type differs from the previous connection. We can do this by  storing the connection type value in the currentType global variable and check  whether this matches the current value.  12. Depending on the returned value of the connection type, we can alternatively choose   to inform the user that to get the most out of our application they should have a  better connection.  13.  We will also increment an integer value stored in the intCheck global variable,   which we will use to count the number of seconds the current connection has   been active: function checkConnection   {     var objConnection = navigator.network.connection;     var connectionInfo = getConnectionType objConnection.type ;     var statusMessage = ' ' + connectionInfo.message +   ' ';      if currentType != objConnection.type  {         intCheck = 0;         currentType = objConnection.type;  168  www.it-ebooks.info           if connectionInfo.value <= 3  {             x$ 'speedMessage' .html ' This application   works better over a faster connection. ' ;         } else {             x$ 'speedMessage' .html '' ;         }     }     intCheck = intCheck + 1;      x$ 'statusMessage' .html statusMessage ;     x$ 'count' .html ' Checked ' + intCheck + ' seconds   ago ' ; }  14.  The getConnectionType method mentioned previously will return a message  and a value property depending on the type value sent as the parameter. The  value properties have been assigned manually to allow us to control what level of  connection we deem best for our application and for the experience of our users: function getConnectionType type  {     var connTypes = {};     connTypes[Connection.NONE] = {         message: 'No network connection',         value: 0     };     connTypes[Connection.UNKNOWN] = {         message: 'Unknown connection',         value: 1     };     connTypes[Connection.ETHERNET] = {         message: 'Ethernet connection',         value: 2     };     connTypes[Connection.CELL_2G] = {         message: 'Cell 2G connection',         value: 3     };     connTypes[Connection.CELL_3G] = {         message: 'Cell 3G connection',         value: 4     };     connTypes[Connection.CELL_4G] = {         message: 'Cell 4G connection',         value: 5     };     connTypes[Connection.WIFI] = {  169  www.it-ebooks.info   15.  Finally, let's add some CSS definitions to the bottom of our application to add some           message: 'WiFi connection',         value: 6     };     return connTypes[type]; }  style to the UI:   divholder {     width: 250px;     min-height: 60px;     margin: 0 auto;     position: relative;     border: 1px solid ff0080;     border-radius: 10px;     background: ff0080; } divholder p {     margin: 20px auto;     text-align: center;     color: ffffff;     font-weight: bold; } divspeedMessage {     width: 250px;     margin: 0 auto;     position: relative; }    16.  On running the application on our device, the output will look something like this:  170  www.it-ebooks.info   17.  If our user changes their connection method or disconnects completely, the interval   timer will detect the change and update the interface accordingly, and the timer   will restart:  How it works... We have set up the onDeviceReady method to create two new event listeners to check for  the online and offline events respectively.  The online event will fire when the device's network connection  is started, and the offline event will fire when the network  connection is turned off or lost.  These events will only fire once, and so in this recipe we added the setInterval timer  function to constantly call the checkConnection method to allow us to obtain the changes  made to the network. The addition of this functionality helps greatly and means that we can  tell when a user switches from a 3G to a Wi-Fi connection, for example. If this happens, they  would not go offline, but simply change the connection type.  To find out more about the online and offline events, refer to  the official documentation available here: https:  github.com apache cordova-plugin- battery-status.  171  www.it-ebooks.info   There's more... Your application may involve streaming data, remote connections, or another process that  requires a certain level of connectivity to a network. By constantly checking the status and  the type of connection, we can determine whether it falls below an optimal level or it is the  recommended type for your application. At this point, you could inform the user or restrict  access to certain remote calls or data streams to avoid latency in your application's response  and possible extra financial costs incurred to the user from their mobile provider.  Creating a custom submenu Your application may include an option for users to update or change settings, or perhaps   the ability to truly exit the application gracefully by closing down all services and storing state  or data.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will create a simple application that interacts with the device's native menu  button to create a sliding submenu:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named submenu by running the    following command: phonegap create submenu com.myapp.submenu submenu  2.  Add a devices platform. You can choose to use Android as follows:  cordova platform add android  3.  Open www index.html and let's clean up unnecessary elements. We'll also   manipulate the DOM elements, so include a reference to the xui.js file within   the head tag. We will include an onLoad method call within the body tag, which   will set the deviceready event listener once the DOM is fully loaded:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >  172  www.it-ebooks.info            Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">          <script type="text javascript"   src="js xui.js">                                4.  Let's now add the UI to the body of the document. Create a new button element   with the id attribute set to menuToggle and an unordered list within a div element.  In this recipe, each anchor tag has a specific id attribute, which we'll use shortly to  assign touch handlers to each link:  Menu Display    Toggle Menu           Close Menu         Hello         Exit Application      5.  Add a new script tag block before the closing head tag in the document and   include the onLoad function that will add the deviceready event listener:       function onLoad   {     document.addEventListener "deviceready",onDeviceReady,       false ;     }     6.  Create the onDeviceReady method, within which we will set a new event listener   to check for the menubutton event. This will run the onMenuPress function once   it is detected.  173  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  We'll also include the setMenuHandlers method, which will apply the touch   handlers to the menu items: function onDeviceReady   {     document.addEventListener "menubutton", onMenuPress,   false ;     setMenuHandlers  ; }  8.  The onMenuPress function, that is the callback from the event listener, will handle   the transition of our menu element and links. We will use the XUI library to determine  the current value of the subMenu element position and react accordingly to either  open or close the menu: function onMenuPress   {     var menuPosition = x$ 'subMenu' .getStyle 'bottom' ;     if  menuPosition == '-100px'  {         x$ 'subMenu' .tween {             bottom: '0px'         } ;     } else {         x$ 'subMenu' .tween {             bottom: '-100px'         } ;     } }  9.  The setMenuHandlers method will apply the touch handlers to our individual menu   items. We can reference each element by the id attribute and set the listener with  the specific action we want it to run. To exit the application, we can call the exitApp  method to gracefully close our application and not leave it running in the background  of the device.  10.  The menuToggle button element and the closeMenu link item both provide   the user with the ability to close the menu by calling the previously created  onMenuPress method: function setMenuHandlers   {     x$ 'exit' .on 'touchstart', function   {         navigator.app.exitApp  ;     } ;     x$ 'hello' .on 'touchend', function   {         alert 'Hello!' ;     } ;     x$ 'closeMenu' .on 'touchend', function   {         onMenuPress  ;     } ;  174  www.it-ebooks.info       x$ 'menuToggle' .on 'touchend', function   {         onMenuPress  ;     } ; }  11.  Finally, we will include some CSS definitions to set the menu into position and apply   color styles and required attributes:   menuToggle {     width: 100%;     height: 40px;     position: relative;     margin: 0 auto;     color: ffffff;     background: ff0080;     font-size: 20px; } subMenu {     position: fixed;     bottom: -100px;     left: 0px;     border-top: 1px solid 555;     height: 100px;     width: 100%;     background: e5e5e5; } subMenu span {     position: relative;     margin: 0 auto;     top: 40%; } subMenu a {     width: 29%;     height: 100px;     display: block;     float: left;     margin: 0 2% 0 2%;     border-left: 1px solid ccc;     border-right: 1px solid ccc;     text-align: center; }    175  www.it-ebooks.info   12. When the application is run on the device, the initial view will look like this:  13.  With the menu open, the user will be presented with our links as follows:  How it works... The onDeviceReady method set up the new event listener to listen for the menubutton  event. At this point, the onMenuPress function is run, which either opens or closes the menu  depending on the current position of the subMenu element.  This is an ideal way to incorporate menu options and the hidden gems of functionality within  your application without overcrowding your user interface.  To create the transition of the menu, we have used the Tween  capabilities provided by the XUI JavaScript library. We'll cover the  library in more detail in the next chapter. To find out more about the menubutton event, refer to the official  documentation available here: http:  docs.phonegap.com  en 3.6.0 cordova_events_events.md.htmlmenubutton.  176  www.it-ebooks.info   There's more... The menubutton event provided by the PhoneGap API is not cross-device or cross-platform  capable. At present, the supported device platforms are Android and BlackBerry WebWorks   OS 5.0 or higher .  There are other ways to include custom menus in your applications, thanks to one of the   many PhoneGap plugins created by the community developers and users.  The Native Menu plugin  https:  github.com mwbrooks cordova-plugin-menu   allows you to add native toolbars, tabbars and menus to your application and is supported   on Android, BlackBerry WebWorks, and iOS platforms.  The community and open source nature of the PhoneGap API and the Cordova product means  that developers can freely extend and enhance the functionality of their applications and dig a  little deeper into native processes offered by the devices by creating custom plugins.  See also   f Chapter 11, Extending PhoneGap with Plugins  177  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   7  Working with XUI  In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:   f Learning the basics of the library  f DOM manipulation  f Working with touch and gesture events  f Updating element styles  f Working with remote data and AJAX requests  f Creating simple tweens and animations  Introduction There are a number of common and widely used JavaScript frameworks that web  professionals use and implement, some of which translate very well into the mobile  landscape, such as jQuery.  There are, however, a number of considerations while selecting a JS framework to use in your  mobile applications. One is the size of the library, which would inevitably add size to your final  packaged application.  While having the full product you may be used to using on your web applications also in use  within your mobile apps is serendipitous, options exist for smaller libraries that contain many  of the features you need, such as CSS selectors, filtering, style detection, and AJAX requests  using XmlHttpRequests.  In this chapter, we will look at the XUI JavaScript library and see how we can use it. XUI was  written and maintained by the core members of the PhoneGap development team specifically  for use in mobile applications, and it removes many of the unnecessary tools and hidden  engines that do not apply to modern browsers available on mobile devices.  179  www.it-ebooks.info   Built with mobile devices in mind, XUI is incredibly small and lightweight and works across all  devices in the mobile landscape. Unlike some other mobile JavaScript libraries available, XUI  does not enforce any page structure or layout. It simply works with the DOM created by the  developer to manipulate the layout and work with the content.  Getting started with XUI Before we can continue with the recipes in this chapter, we must download a copy of the   XUI library.  How to do it… Perform the following steps for the prerequisites to begin with the recipes:  1.  Visit https:  github.com xui xui.  You can either clone the project or click on the Download ZIP button, as shown in   this screenshot:  2.  XUI can be built to suit your needs. You can either build the library yourself or use the   provided xui.js for simplicity.  3.  We can now proceed with the recipes.  180  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the basics of the library When creating applications that focus as heavily on user interactions as mobile apps do, we  want to be able to easily update and manage the underlying HTML and data collections.  How to do it... We'll make use of XUI's simple but powerful DOM traversal methods and the ability to extend  the library functionality to custom code:  1.  Create the basic layout for the HTML page. 2.  Create a div element within the page with some text. In this case, we're going to   3.   create a Hello World sample text. Set the id attribute for this element to content. Include a new script tag in the head tag of your document, and reference the XUI  library within your project directory:          <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,      initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,      minimum-scale=1, width=device-width;"  >   <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text html;   charset=utf-8">    XUI                    Hello World   4.  Before the closing head tag, we include a new script tag block, inside which we'll   place the onLoad method, and an XUI on event to execute the method once the DOM  has fully loaded:      x$ window .on 'load', onLoad ;  181  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  Let's use this method to obtain the value of the content element on our page. We can   access the XUI library and its methods using the global x$   function.  6.  Create a new variable called contentDiv. We'll pass the id of the div to the XUI     function onLoad   {      }     global function to obtain the object reference: function onLoad   {      var contentDiv = x$ 'content' ;     console.log contentDiv ;     console.log contentDiv.length ;     console.log contentDiv[0].outerText ;  }  7.   If we run the page in a browser and open the console view, we can see the returned  data written to the console log, like this:  8.  The first result is a large structure containing a lot of detailed information about the   content div element, a sample of which is shown here:  182  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  The level of details about the returned object is quite extensive, and we can use some   of this to programmatically obtain the details about our selected elements.  10.  Amend the div element to add some more attributes, such as the style and class   attributes, like this: <div id="content"   style="border: 2px solid e5e5e5;"     class="sampleText">     Hello World    183  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  Then, amend the onLoad method to include the code to obtain the array node   containing all the attributes within the selected document element.  12. We'll use this array and loop over the contents to build an HTML string containing the   id and value of each attribute within the 'content' div element.  13.  Finally, we'll display the generated string after the original div element on the page:  var contentDiv = x$ 'content' ;  var attributes = contentDiv[0].attributes;  if  attributes.length  {      var attrMessage = '';      attrMessage = ' ' + contentDiv[0].id + ' ' +   contentDiv[0].localName + ' has ' + attributes.length + '   attributes: ';      attrMessage += ' ';      for  i = 0; i < attributes.length; i++  {         attrMessage += ' ' + attributes[i].localName + ' "'   + attributes[i].value + '" ';     }      attrMessage += ' ';      contentDiv.after attrMessage ; }  14.  When you run the amended code in your browser, you will see something similar to   what is shown here:  184  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's now take a look at some of the other useful methods available in the XUI library, which  also help form a solid understanding of the basic functionality available:  1.  Create a new HTML file, including a reference to the XUI JavaScript library, and an   empty script tag block before the closing head tag.  2.  Within the empty script block, define a new onLoad method. 3.  Add an XUI on event handler to run the onLoad JavaScript method when the DOM    is ready.  4.  The body of the document will contain two unordered list elements, each with their   own id attributes, set to family and friends, respectively. Each list item has a  specific class attribute that relates to the gender of the individual within the list.  Feel free to list your own family and friends.  5.  Finally, we'll include a div element before the closing body tag, with the id attribute   set to output:             <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,          initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,  185  www.it-ebooks.info            minimum-scale=1, width=device-width;"  >     <meta http-equiv="Content-type"     content="text html; charset=utf-8">      XUI      <script type="text javascript"     src="xui.js">                x$ window .on 'load', onLoad ;      function onLoad   {      }                      Ted       Molly       Cate       Jean      George                  Steve       Pip       Dave       Scott                  6.  We'll add some code to the onLoad method to filter the various list elements. Firstly, we   create an empty strMessage variable, in which we'll build our string for the output.  7.  We can access all the names within the document list elements, which will provide us   with an array of results. We'll store it in the allNames variable: function onLoad   {   var strMessage = '';  186  www.it-ebooks.info     var allNames = x$ 'li' ;    strMessage += ' There are ' + allNames.length       + ' names in total '; }  8.  Let's now find elements within specific lists. We can select all the names within our  family list by providing a specific element to look into. In this case, we just want to  select from the unordered list where the id attribute equals family.  Although we explicitly called the find   method to locate  the list items in this instance, the x$ namespace is an alias  for the find   method. As such, we didn't call it in the  previous example to obtain all the names in our lists, but  we were performing the same function.  9.  With can now dig a little deeper and find list items that match a given CSS selector.  Here, we will first look for all items within the allFamily array that have the male  class, and then those that have the female class. We assign both results to new  array variables and add details to our output string: var allFamily = x$ 'family' .find 'li' ; var maleFamily = allFamily.has '.male' ; var femaleFamily = allFamily.has '.female' ;  strMessage += ' ' + allFamily.length + ' family members   are listed:';  strMessage += '  ' +   maleFamily.length + ' male  ' +   femaleFamily.length + ' female   ';  10.  Let's do the same to access all the names on our friends list. 11.  While accessing the class selectors to see whether an element has a particular   class or not, we can also check whether an element does not have a matching CSS  selector, as we are doing here for our female friends: var allFriends = x$ 'friends' .find 'li' ; var maleFriends = allFriends.has '.male' ; var femaleFriends = allFriends.not '.male' ;  strMessage += ' ' + allFriends.length + ' friends are   listed:';  strMessage += '  ' + maleFriends.length + '  male  ' +   femaleFriends.length + ' female   ';  187  www.it-ebooks.info   12. Finally, we can set the generated string variable in the div element for display:  x$ 'output' .html strMessage ;  13.  Another of XUI's built-in methods allows us to iterate over a collection of elements.  Let's combine this into a generic function, which we will use to extend the native   XUI library.  14.  Create a new variable called nameFunctions. It will be an object containing the   various functions that we wish to use to extend the library.  15.  Name the first reference generateList, write the function code to iterate over    each element of the provided array, and set the resulting string variable in the   parent element: var nameFunctions = {     generateList: function array  {         var list = ' ';          array.each function element, index, xui  {             list += element.outerHTML;         } ;  16.  Finally, revise the onLoad method and add four calls to the getNameList function,           list += ' ';          this.bottom list ;     } }  passing to it each array and list id attribute:  x$ 'output' .html strMessage ;  xui.extend nameFunctions ;  x$ 'maleFamily' .generateList maleFamily ; x$ 'femaleFamily' .generateList femaleFamily ; x$ 'maleFriends' .generateList maleFriends ; x$ 'femaleFriends' .generateList femaleFriends ;  188  www.it-ebooks.info   Upon running the page in the browser, the output will look something like what is shown here:  How it works... In this recipe, we used the find method available in XUI to locate specific elements within our  document. We also made use of the has and not methods to access elements using the   CSS selector.  Finally, we extended the functionality offered through XUI by setting our own function in the  namespace for easy access to the elements and method calls.  189  www.it-ebooks.info   DOM manipulation Although we may be building our applications in HTML, we still have the ability to alter and  manipulate the elements within the document to create a more dynamic application.  How to do it... We will use the DOM manipulation methods available in the XUI library to read and write  content directly within our application:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named dom by running the following line:  phonegap create dom com.myapp.dom dom  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Open www index.html. Let's clean up the unnecessary elements. Include a   reference to the XUI JavaScript library, the Cordova JavaScript file, and an empty  script tag block before the closing head tag.  4.  Within the empty script block, define a new onLoad method. 5.  Add an on event handler. It will run the onLoad JavaScript method when the DOM   6.  The body of the document will contain a div element with the id attribute set    has fully loaded.  to content:            <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,          initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,          minimum-scale=1, width=device-width"  >     <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text html;   charset=utf-8">      XUI             <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">            x$ window .on 'load', onLoad ;      function onLoad   {      }  190  www.it-ebooks.info                             7.  Before the onLoad method, let's define a new JavaScript object variable. It will act    as a container to hold our various HTML strings. We'll access these from button  click events: var textContent = {     top: ' Top Context ',     inner: ' Inner context ',     bottom: ' Bottom Context ',     after: ' DOM Manipulation is easy with XUI! ' };  8.  Let's now amend the onLoad method to include an event listener to verify that the   device is ready, at which point the onDeviceReady method will fire: function onLoad   {     document.addEventListener "deviceready",         onDeviceReady, false ; }  9.   Include the onDeviceReady function. This will make use of the DOM manipulation  features and set an h1 tag before the content div element.  10.  We'll also set up an event listener to manage button clicks. This will take the id   attribute of button, select the relevant value from our textContent object, and  insert it into the relevant position in the DOM: function onDeviceReady   {      x$ 'content' .before ' XUI DOM Manipulation ' ;      x$ 'button' .on 'click', function e  {         x$ 'content' .html this.id, textContent[this.id] ;     } ;  }  191  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  Back in the HTML, add the following button elements at the top of the body   content. Notice how each button has a specific id attribute for referencing the   object values:  Inner   Top   Bottom   After       have been added:  12. Finally, let's add some basic styles to the document elements to easily see when they       divcontent { border: 2px solid e5e5e5; }   divtop { background: ff0000; color: fff; }   divbottom { background: ffff00; color: 000; }    When you run the application on a device, the output should look something like what is  shown here:  192  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... We created a simple mobile application to see how the XUI library can manipulate the DOM.  To set a value within an element, we can use the html   function, appended to the XUI  element collection.  The html function takes two arguments:   f location: A String that determines the location surrounding the selected element   where the DOM manipulation should take place   f html: A String that contains the HTML markup or elements to be placed in the DOM  The location can be one of the following: inner, outer, top, bottom, remove, before,   or after.  In our button click handler function, we used the html method and passed the location  string, which we accessed from the id attribute of the clicked-on button.  You can also access the locations directly using the shorthand version and simply pass the  HTML element or markup, which we did for our h1 tag entry, like this:  x$ 'content' .before ' XUI DOM Manipulation ' ;  To access the current HTML within an element, we simply need to call the methods without  passing an HTML value to set, as follows:     Get the value of the content element x$ 'content' .html  ;  Working with touch and gesture events When working with user interfaces that demand a high level of user interaction or certain  processes to be run at certain moments, we need to consider using events and detecting  them to execute methods. In this recipe, we will create some functionality that will  demonstrate not only the setting of an event but also its removal.  How to do it... We will use the methods available in the XUI library to control the delegation of event handlers:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named touch by running the following line:  phonegap create touch com.myapp.touch touch  193  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Add the dialog plugin by running this line:  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.dialogs  4.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. Include a   reference to the XUI JavaScript library and the Cordova JavaScript file.  5.  Add an empty script tag block before the closing head tag. This will hold our   custom PhoneGap code. Within this, define a new onLoad function.  6.  Add an on event handler. It will run the onLoad JavaScript method when the DOM   7.  Finally, add a new button element within the body of the document. Set the id   has fully loaded.  attribute to touchme:                              <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <script type="text javascript"   src="xui.js">          <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                         x$ window .on 'load', onLoad ;              function onLoad   {              }  194  www.it-ebooks.info                       XUI                       Touch gestures            9.   8.  Let's add the first of our XUI events. We want to be really sure that the DOM has fully  loaded before we manipulate it. The ready   method will run once this is the case,  so place it within the onLoad method. Inside the event, we'll set up our event listener to execute the onDeviceready  method once the PhoneGap code is ready to run: function onLoad   {     x$.ready function   {         console.log 'The DOM is ready to go!' ;         document.addEventListener "deviceready",   onDeviceReady, false ;     } ; }  10.  Create the onDeviceReady function. This will register a new touchstart event to   the button element: function onDeviceReady   {     x$ 'touchme' .on 'touchstart', touchConfirmation ; }  11.  The touchConfirmation function will run when the button event has been fired—  when it has been touched.  12. Here, we'll display a confirmation notification event from the dialog plugin API to give   our users the choice to either keep touching our button or release it: var touchConfirmation = function   {     navigator.notification.confirm          'Do you want to apply a touch gesture again?',         touchConfirmAction,         'Touch gesture detected..',  195  www.it-ebooks.info           'Yes,No'       };  13.  Now we need to add the callback function to deal with the selected user option    14.  If the user selects Yes, they can continue to press the button and see the    from the confirmation box.  notification window.  15.  If they select No, we will unregister the event applied to the button, removing the   ability to perform any actions when touched.  16.  Upon running the application on the browser and selecting No, the button value will   change. The output will look something like what is shown in this screenshot:  196  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... In this recipe, we used our first event to detect when the DOM would be ready for us—the  ready   method.  We also specifically applied a touchstart event to a button element, which when pressed  would alert the user with a notification window.  We then added the functionality of unregistering the specific touchstart callback, which  would remove the functionality of displaying the notification window.  Updating element styles As we build our applications and apply a number of styles and properties to define the layout  and visual representation of elements, we also need to be able to update and alter the  aesthetics and styles to reflect changes or events within the application.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will read, write, and detect the style properties and class attributes assigned  to selected elements using XUI's built-in style functions:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named element by running this line:  phonegap create element com.myapp.element element  2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  197  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Open www index.html. Let's clean up the unnecessary elements. Include a   reference to the XUI JavaScript library and the Cordova JavaScript file.  4.  We write a new script tag block before the closing head tag, which will hold our  custom PhoneGap application code. Define an empty onLoad function inside the  script block.  5.  Add three button elements to the body of the document, each with its own   6.  Finally, include the on event listener to run the onLoad function:  individual id attribute.                               <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <script type="text javascript"   src="xui.js">          <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                         x$ window .on 'load', onLoad ;              function onLoad   {              }                     XUI                       Button One           Button Two           Button Three            198  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  The onLoad method will set up the XUI ready event handler, which in turn will add   the event listener to run the onDeviceReady method when the PhoneGap code has  been compiled and is ready to run: function onLoad   {     x$.ready function   {         document.addEventListener "deviceready",             onDeviceReady, false ;     } ; }  8.  When the onDeviceReady method executes, the first thing we want to do is register   a click handler to all the buttons. We can determine which button was clicked on by  reading the this.id value that follows a click event.  9.  We'll check whether the selected button has a specific CSS class called active   applied to it. If it does not, we'll add the class to the element.  10.  We'll also obtain the font-size style attribute applied to the element and send that  value to a new method called resizeFont. This will increase the font-size value  by the integer defined in the parameters. In this case, it will add 5 pixels to the value.  11.  If the selected button already has the active class applied to it, we'll remove the   class and reduce the font-size style property on the button element: function onDeviceReady   {      x$ 'button' .on 'click', function e  {          var selectedButton = x$ '' + this.id + '' ;          if  !selectedButton.hasClass 'active'   {              selectedButton.addClass 'active' ;             selectedButton.getStyle 'font-size',                 function property  {                     resizeFont selectedButton, property, '+', 5 ;                 } ;          } else {              selectedButton.removeClass 'active' ;             selectedButton.getStyle 'font-size',                 function property  {                     resizeFont selectedButton, property, '-', 5 ;  199  www.it-ebooks.info                   } ;          }     } ;  }  12.  Now let's write the resizeFont function. This function will accept four parameters: the   button element, the value of the getStyle property response, whether to increase  or decrease the font size, and the amount by which to alter the original property.  13.  Once we have calculated the new font size, we'll use the setStyle method from XUI   to change the style value for the element: function resizeFont element, property, direction, alterBy    {     var sizeType = property.replace  [0-9]+ , "" ;     var fontSize = property.replace  [^-\d\.] g, "" ;     if  '-' === direction  {         fontSize = parseInt fontSize  - alterBy;     } else {         fontSize = parseInt fontSize  + alterBy;     }     element.setStyle 'font-size', fontSize + sizeType ; }  14.  To finish off, include some CSS at the bottom of the HTML page to define two states   for the buttons—the normal state and the active selected state:   button {     background: rgba 100, 100, 100, 0.6 ;     color: fff;     padding: 5px 10px;     float: left;     margin: 5px 5px 0 0;     border-radius: 2px;     font-size: 11px;     font-weight: 600;     cursor: pointer;     border: none; } button.active {     background: EEA839;  200  www.it-ebooks.info       color: fff;     padding: 5px 10px;     float: left;     margin: 5px 5px 0 0;     border-radius: 3px;     font-size: 11px;     font-weight: 600;     cursor: pointer;     border: none; }    buttons in their normal state:  15.  If we run the application on a device, the initial screen will look like this, with all three   16.  If you select a button element, you can see that XUI has applied the active style   and altered the size of the font. Selecting an active button will remove the styles and  revert it to its normal state.  201  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... In this recipe, we made use of the style manipulation and selector functions in XUI.  After detecting a button click event, we were able to check whether the particular button  had a specific class, and were able to easily add it to the element if it did not, using the  hasClass and addClass methods, respectively. Similarly, if the class was already applied to  the button, we removed it using the removeClass method.  We were also able to alter the style properties of our CSS by first accessing it using the  getStyle method, and then setting the amended property value using setStyle.  There's more... We took a slightly longer route in this example to detect and change the button class   attribute. This was intentional so that we could see the addClass and removeClass  methods in action.  We could have removed them both entirely, as well as the hasClass method, using the  toggleClass method, which is also available in the XUI library.  This method adds the specified class it if exists on the selected element, or removes it if it  does not, like this:  x$ 'myButton' .toggleClass 'active' ;  It's always good to know that you have options!  Working with remote data and AJAX  requests With a vast array of remote servers exposing their services as accessible APIs, you can create  some truly dynamic applications by pulling and pushing data to and from external applications  and providers.  How to do it... We will use the XHR method within the XUI library to request data from a remote server,  making an asynchronous call to obtain the results from a search:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named ajax by running the following line:  phonegap create ajax com.myapp.ajax ajax  202  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Add the devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. Include a   reference to the XUI JavaScript library and the Cordova JavaScript file.  4.  Create a new script tag block before the closing body tag with an empty    onLoad function, which we'll populate shortly.  5.  Add an XUI on event handler to run the onLoad method once the DOM has    fully loaded:                              <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <script type="text javascript"   src="xui.js">          <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                         x$ window .on 'load', onLoad ;              function onLoad   {              }                     XUI                        203  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  Within the body of the document, add a text input element with the id attribute  set to criteria. Below this, include a new button element with the id attribute  set to search.  7.  Finally, create a new div block with the id attribute set to response. This will hold   our returned data from the remote calls:       <input value="1" type="number" type="text"   id="criteria"  >      search             9.   8.  Amend the onLoad method to include a call to the XUI ready event, which will   execute when the DOM is ready. Inside of this event handler, add a new event listener to run the onDeviceReady  method once the native PhoneGap code is ready, as follows: function onLoad   {     x$.ready function   {         document.addEventListener "deviceready",             onDeviceReady, false ;     } ; }  10.  Now, let's create the onDeviceReady method. We will apply a touchstart event   handler to the button element. This will clear any content that is currently present in  the response div element.  11.  It will then obtain the value of the criteria input field as specified by the user, and   pass that value to a new function: function onDeviceReady   {      x$ 'search' .on 'touchstart', function e  {         x$ 'response' .html ' ' ;         var criteria = x$ 'criteria' [0].value;         generateUser criteria ;     } ;  12. Create a new function called generateUser, which accepts the user input. This    will make a simple AJAX call to the randomuser.me API to return x entries of a  random user.  }  204  www.it-ebooks.info   13.  Set the inline callback option to execute a function called processResults, which   will also contain the response from the request: function generateUser criteria  {      x$ 'response' .xhr          'http:  api.randomuser.me ?results='+criteria, {             async: true,             callback: function   {                 processResults this.responseText ;             },             headers: {                 'Mobile': 'true'             }         } ;  }  14.  The processResults method will parse the JSON response from the request. The   function will loop over the results so that we can access each entry.  15.  We'll use this data to build a simple element collection containing the content of the  tweet element, which we'll then add at the bottom of the response div container: function processResults response  {     var response = JSON.parse response ;     console.log response ;     var results = response.results;     for  var i = 0; i < results.length; i++  {         var data = results[i].user.name.first + ' ' +   results[i].user.name.last;         var dataDiv = ' ' +             data + ' ';         x$ 'response' .bottom dataDiv ;     } }  16.  Finally, add some style definitions at the bottom of the document to add some   formatting to the returned tweet elements:    .tweet {     border: 1px solid 999;     background: e5e5e5;     clear: both;     margin: 5px;     padding: 5px; }    205  www.it-ebooks.info   Once the user has entered the quantity criteria and pressed the button, the remote call will  fire, and the response will look like this:  How it works... In this recipe, we used the xhr   method, available within the XUI JavaScript library, to make  a request to a remote web service, the Twitter search API in this case.  Using xhr  , we made an XmlHttpRequest to the provided URL, which ran an  asynchronous call. We passed a callback method called processResults. It looped over the  returned entries and built an element collection containing the tweet before adding each one  at the bottom of the response container.  For more information about the xhr   method, make sure you check out the official XUI  documentation at https:  github.com xui xuijs.com blob master views  docs xhr.ejs.  206  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating simple tweens and animations Although altering elements in our application's pages is relatively easy, we can further enhance  the user's experience by adding some animation to these elements as we change them.  How to do it... We will use the tween   method within the XUI library to alter a property of an image and  tween the element to its new position on the screen:  1.  Firstly, create a new PhoneGap project named tweens by running this line:  phonegap create tweens com.myapp.tweens tweens  2.  Add a devices platform. You can choose to use Android, iOS, or both:  cordova platform add ios  cordova platform add android  3.  Open www index.html and clean up the unnecessary elements. Include a   reference to the XUI JavaScript library and the Cordova JavaScript file.  4.  We add an XUI ready event handler to run our code once the DOM has fully loaded:                               <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <script type="text javascript"   src="xui.js">          <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">                        x$.ready function   {              } ;  207  www.it-ebooks.info                       XUI                        5.  Within the body of the document, add two button elements, one with the id   attribute set to up, and the other with the id attribute set to down. Below these, add  an empty div tag block with the id attribute set to details.  6.  Add a new div tag block with the id attribute set to rocket, inside of which you   have to add an image tag with the src attribute referencing the rocket.gif   image file:        UP       DOWN                                    7.  Now, let's start adding our custom code to the ready   method. Firstly, we'll create   two variables that reference the rocket and details div elements.  8.  We'll then create a click handler event, applied to the up button. It will obtain the   value of the rocket element's bottom CSS property. We can then increment   the value by 100 to create a new position for the element.  9.  Next, we will send the property to the tween method to animate the    rocket element: x$.ready function   {     var rocket = x$ 'rocket' ;     var details = x$ 'details' ;      x$ 'up' .on 'click', function e  {          rocket.getStyle 'bottom', function property  {             sizeType = property.replace  [0-9]+ , "" ;             topPosition = property.replace  [^-\d\.] g, "" ;  208  www.it-ebooks.info               topPosition = parseInt topPosition  + 100;             newPosition = topPosition + sizeType;             rocket.tween {                     bottom: newPosition,                     duration: 1000                 },                 function   {                     details.html 'bottom: ' + newPosition ;                 }              ;         } ;      } ;  } ;  10.  Now, we need to create the click handler event for the down button directly below  this, within the ready   method, which has the same functionality but decreases  the value of the bottom property by 100: x$ 'down' .on 'click', function e  {      rocket.getStyle 'bottom', function property  {         sizeType = property.replace  [0-9]+ , "" ;         topPosition = property.replace  [^-\d\.] g, "" ;         topPosition = parseInt topPosition  - 100;         newPosition = topPosition + sizeType;         rocket.tween {                 bottom: newPosition,                 duration: 1000             },             function   {                 details.html 'bottom: ' + newPosition ;             }          ;     } ;  } ;  11.  Finally, add some style definitions at the bottom of the document to apply the default   positions and format for the elements:     body { background: 0c0440 url outerspace.jpg  repeat; }  209  www.it-ebooks.info     divrocket { bottom: 0px; position: absolute; width:   31px; height: 72px; left: 100px; }   divdetails { color: ffff00; height: 20px; position:   inherit; top: 20px; right: 20px; float: right; }    12. If we run the application on a device, the initial display will be something like this:  210  www.it-ebooks.info   13.  If we choose to move the rocket element up, then the result will look like what is   shown in the following screenshot:  How it works... The tween   method transforms a CSS property value, in our case the bottom property of  the rocket element. Before we could change the value, we first obtained its current value  using XUI's getStyle   method. Once we altered the value of the property, we sent it to   the tween   method. We also sent an optional property to set the duration of the animation  in milliseconds.  211  www.it-ebooks.info   The tween   method accepts two arguments:   f properties: An Object or Array of CSS properties to tween  f callback: An optional Function that is called when the animation is complete  In our example, we used the optional callback argument to update the contents of the  details element with the new bottom property for the rocket element.  212  www.it-ebooks.info   8  Working with the   Ionic Framework  In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:   f Getting familiar with basics of the library  f Exploring Ionic commands  f Exploring the Ionic framework structure  f Using Cordova  Introduction This chapter provides basic information about the Ionic framework and how to get started  using it. When creating a hybrid mobile application, we often have a problem dealing with   the UI component. We want our hybrid app UI to look like a native app. Instead of creating   CSS for styling from scratch, it would be easier and faster to use a framework that provides  the UI component.  The Ionic framework is an HTML5 framework. It not only provides a native-looking UI  component, but also powerful JavaScript framework via Angular JS. The Ionic framework   gives a lot of Angular JS directives to make building a hybrid application easier and faster.  The Ionic framework works well with Cordova and PhoneGap. In fact, the Ionic framework  command-line interface  CLI  depends on Cordova CLI to work. Ionic framework provides   an easy way to interact with the Cordova plugin by using Cordova.  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting familiar with basics of the library There are several ways to get started using Ionic Framework. The easiest way is to utilize Ionic  CLI, which is an NPM package. NPM is a dependency manager for Node.js.  How to do it... Perform the following steps to get started with Ionic framework:  1.   Install Ionic CLI by running the following command in the terminal. You may need  super user access: npm install -g cordova ionic  2.   If somehow Ionic is not installed, you may require root access: sudo npm install -g cordova ionic  3.  Check your installation by running the following command:  ionic -v  If you see following output, Ionic has been installed on your machine:  4.  Create a new Ionic app project by using a readymade template:  ionic start myapp tabs  214  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  Run the project by using the following command; you can change ios to android    if you want to emulate on Android instead: cd myapp ionic platform add ios ionic build ios ionic emulate ios  6.  Your Ionic app is running on the emulator:  Congratulations! You have successfully created and run an Ionic app.  How it works… In this recipe, we installed Ionic CLI from the command line terminal by using npm. The npm  dependency manager downloaded Ionic CLI files and set up the ionic command so that we  could run the ionic command from the command line terminal.  We also created project by using a readymade template for tabs. This template gives us an  easy starting point to build a tabs-based application. Another available template is sidemenu.  The sidemenu template provides a starter template to build an application with side menu  navigation. If you prefer to build from scratch, there is a blank template. The blank template  sets up the project directory and provides default HTML and minimal JavaScript code.  215  www.it-ebooks.info   We then added a platform to the project by using ionic platform add  .   This command may be familiar to you if you have worked with other recipes in this book.   The ionic command will invoke the cordova command on certain commands; more will   be explained later.  Finally, we built the project and ran the app on the emulator.  Exploring Ionic commands In this section, we are going to explore Ionic commands. Ionic commands allow us to create,  build, and run an Ionic application from the command line or terminal. Working via command  line makes application development faster. We don't need to open the specific project, that is,  the Android project in IDE, in order to build and run the app.  Ionic commands not only help us by creating, building, and running Ionic-based applications,  they also provide other tools to make the development process more enjoyable. By knowing  basic Ionic commands, we can improve our workflow while developing hybrid mobile  applications.  How to do it... To get started exploring various Ionic commands, follow these steps:  1.  Create a new tabs-based Ionic application by running the following command:  ionic start awesomeApp tabs  2.  Change the directory by running the following command:  cd awesomeApp  3.  After the project has been generated through Ionic commands, we have to add the   platform to our application. This can be done by running ionic platform add   . To add iOS and Android platforms, run the following commands: ionic platform add ios ionic platform add android  4.  For the next step, we will write our application. The default file location is  www.    We will explore the folder structure later in this chapter.  216  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  Assuming we don't make any changes to the code, the next step is to run the   application. For testing and development purposes, we often prefer to run and   debug hybrid application from the browser. Setting up new web servers to test   and run applications may be time consuming. Ionic provides a simple command   to build a web server that allows us to run and debug applications in the browser: ionic serve  6.  After the server has been initialized, the ionic command will open the browser. Now   we can see our application running in the browser:  217  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  The local server generated by the ionic serve command uses live reload.   This means that whenever we edit and save *.js and *.html, the browser   will automatically refresh the app.  8.  The next step is adding plugins to extend the application's capabilities. But we are   going to explore plugins and ngCordova later in this chapter.  9.  After testing it in the browser, we can build the application by using the    following commands: ionic build ios ionic build android  10.  Next, run the application on the emulator by running:  ionic emulate ios  218  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  The application is now running on the emulator:  How it works… First, we created a new tabs-based application by running the ionic start command.  With this, Ionic downloads project files from the repository to our local directory. This process  saves us a lot of time from setting up the Ionic library to work with our Cordova PhoneGap  application.  Then, we ran the ionic platform command to add a certain platform to our application.  This command downloads the platform-specific project structure. For instance, if iOS platform  is added, the Xcode project will be downloaded and placed in our Ionic project.  Once we added the device platform, we started the local server for our app by running ionic  serve. This opens up a browser and runs the application. The server has a built-in live reload  feature. It watches our HTML and JavaScript files. Whenever they change, the browser reloads  the app instantly.  219  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, we built our Ionic application by running the ionic build command. This command  builds our application by using a platform-specific project builder. On the Android platform, Ant  will be used to build the app. After the build process was completed, we then ran the ionic  application in the emulator using the ionic emulate command.  We can open official documentation for Ionic framework  using the ionic docs command. The command will open  http:  ionicframework.com docs  in the browser.  Exploring the Ionic framework structure In this section, we are going to explore the Ionic framework project structure. By  understanding this structure, we can understand how Ionic framework works. We will start  with the basic directory structure, the configuration files, and then the application files.  How to do it…  Basic directory structure To start exploring the Ionic framework directories and files, follow these steps:  1.  Create a new blank Ionic project: ionic start thirdApp blank  2.  Change the directory by running the following command:  cd thirdApp  3.  Add the platform to the project: cordova platform add ios cordova platform android  the current directory in Finder: open .   4.  Open the project directory. Run the following command if you are using Mac to open   220  www.it-ebooks.info   You will see the following directory structure:  5.  You may notice that the project structure is the same with the PhoneGap Cordova   project. Ionic uses the cordova CLI behind the scenes. An Ionic project is basically   a Cordova project with several additions.  Ionic generates four configuration files: bower.json, gulpfile.js, ionic.project, and  package.json.  The Cordova project has four directories: hooks, platforms, plugins, resources, and www.  Configuration and resources In this recipe, we will discuss configuration files and the resources directory. Configuration  files contain the application's configuration: either application-level configuration  config. xml, ionic.project  or dependency-level configuration  package.json, bower.json,  gulpfile.js . The resources directory is used to change the application's icon and splash  screen. Follow these steps to get a better understanding about Ionic project configuration:  1.  The config.xml file contains the Cordova project settings. You will see config.  xml on Cordova, PhoneGap, and Ionic project. Open config.xml; the first section of  this file is the application's name and description:   <widget id="com.ionicframework.thirdapp986055"   version="0.0.1" xmlns="http:  www.w3.org ns widgets"   xmlns:cdv="http:  cordova.apache.org ns 1.0">    thirdApp              An Ionic Framework and Cordova project.        221  www.it-ebooks.info     <author email="hi@ionicframework"   href="http:  ionicframework.com ">       Ionic Framework Team        2.   In the next section, you will see default content, which is index.html. There will be  an access origin option to allow the application to access certain URLs.          3.  You will then see a bunch of default preferences of the application's behavior:                           4.  There will be a feature named StatusBar that shows the option to hide or show the   iOS status bar:       <param name="ios-package" value="CDVStatusBar"   onload="true" >      5.  The last section of config.xml will be platform-specific configuration. The following   configuration is used to define the size of each application icon and splash screen  images:         <icon src="resources ios icon icon.png" width="57"   height="57" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon@2x.png" width="114"   height="114" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-40.png" width="40"   height="40" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-40@2x.png"   width="80" height="80" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-50.png" width="50"   height="50" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-50@2x.png"   width="100" height="100" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-60.png" width="60"   height="60" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-60@2x.png"   width="120" height="120" >  222  www.it-ebooks.info       <icon src="resources ios icon icon-60@3x.png"   width="180" height="180" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-72.png" width="72"   height="72" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-72@2x.png"   width="144" height="144" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-76.png" width="76"   height="76" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-76@2x.png"   width="152" height="152" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-small.png"   width="29" height="29" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-small@2x.png"   width="58" height="58" >     <icon src="resources ios icon icon-small@3x.png"   width="87" height="87" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default-568h@2x~iphone.png"  height="1136" width="640" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default-667h.png"   height="1334" width="750" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default-736h.png"   height="2208" width="1242" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default-Landscape-736h.png"  height="1242" width="2208" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default-Landscape@2x~ipad. png" height="1536" width="2048" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default-Landscape~ipad.png"  height="768" width="1024" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default-Portrait@2x~ipad. png" height="2048" width="1536" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default-Portrait~ipad.png"  height="1024" width="768" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default@2x~iphone.png"   height="960" width="640" >     <splash src="resources ios splash Default~iphone.png"   height="480" width="320" >        While the config.xml file is pretty self-explanatory, you may  want to explore other available options for the configuration.  You can find a well-documented description of config.xml  at https:  cordova.apache.org docs en 4.0.0  config_ref_index.md.html.  223  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  ionic.project holds Ionic cloud-related configuration. The Ionic cloud service   Ionic View enables us to build applications on the cloud and then test the app using  a viewer. The viewer allows us to run the application without having to install the  application binary  .apk or .ipa . Ionic cloud service is beyond the scope of this  book.  7.  package.json is a Node.js configuration that contains project dependencies and   other metadata. It may contain the following JSON: {     "name": "thirdapp",     "version": "1.0.0",     "description": "thirdApp: An Ionic project",     "dependencies": {         "gulp": "^3.5.6",         "gulp-sass": "^1.3.3",         "gulp-concat": "^2.2.0",         "gulp-minify-css": "^0.3.0",         "gulp-rename": "^1.2.0"     },     "devDependencies": {         "bower": "^1.3.3",         "gulp-util": "^2.2.14",         "shelljs": "^0.3.0"     },     "cordovaPlugins": [         "org.apache.cordova.device",         "org.apache.cordova.console",         "com.ionic.keyboard"     ],     "cordovaPlatforms": [] }  8.  bower.json is a Bower configuration. Bower is a package manager to manage  frontend element dependency, such as CSS and JavaScript. In our application,   the only dependency is Ionic: {     "name": "thirdApp",     "private": "true",     "devDependencies": {         "ionic": "driftyco ionic-bower1.0.0-rc.3"     } }  224  www.it-ebooks.info   For more information about Bower, visit http:  bower.io.  9.  gulpfile.js contains the configuration for the Gulp task runner. The task runner is  particularly helpful to execute repetitive tasks, such as compiling SASS, watching files  for live reload feature, and so on. Following are the default tasks for Ionic application: var gulp = require 'gulp' ; var gutil = require 'gulp-util' ; var bower = require 'bower' ; var concat = require 'gulp-concat' ; var sass = require 'gulp-sass' ; var minifyCss = require 'gulp-minify-css' ; var rename = require 'gulp-rename' ; var sh = require 'shelljs' ;  var paths = {     sass: ['. scss ** *.scss'] };  gulp.task 'default', ['sass'] ;  gulp.task 'sass', function done  {     gulp.src '. scss ionic.app.scss'          .pipe sass {             errLogToConsole: true         }           .pipe gulp.dest '. www css '           .pipe minifyCss {             keepSpecialComments: 0         }           .pipe rename {             extname: '.min.css'         }           .pipe gulp.dest '. www css '           .on 'end', done ; } ;  gulp.task 'watch', function   {     gulp.watch paths.sass, ['sass'] ; } ;  225  www.it-ebooks.info   gulp.task 'install', ['git-check'], function   {     return bower.commands.install           .on 'log', function data  {             gutil.log 'bower', gutil.colors.cyan data.id ,   data.message ;         } ; } ;  gulp.task 'git-check', function done  {     if  !sh.which 'git'   {         console.log              '  ' + gutil.colors.red 'Git is not   installed.' ,             '\n  Git, the version control system, is   required to download Ionic.',             '\n  Download git here:',   gutil.colors.cyan 'http:  git-scm.com downloads'  + '.',             '\n  Once git is installed, run \'' +   gutil.colors.cyan 'gulp install'  + '\' again.'          ;         process.exit 1 ;     }     done  ; } ;  To get a better understanding about the Gulp task runner  and adding new tasks, visit http:  gulpjs.com .  10.  The resources directory holds icons and splash screens for our application.    The easiest way to change the two is by replacing them with the correct   resolution images. The resources directory consists of the following contents:  226  www.it-ebooks.info   Application files Application files are located within the www directory. We are going to write our application in  the www directory. An Ionic project generates CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files automatically.  Follow these steps to dig into the real Ionic framework application files:  1.  Open the www directory in the file manager. You will see the following files:  227  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  The css, img, and js directories are pretty self-explanatory. They contain the   application's style sheet, images, and JavaScript respectively, while the lib directory  holds the application's library. In our application is Ionic itself. The Ionic library consists  of a style sheet, fonts, and JavaScript, which produce nice UI elements and components  to use.  3.  The main file of the Ionic application itself is index.html. After opening it, you will   get the following content and see a bunch of JavaScript references:                  <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1,   maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width">                        <!-- IF using Sass  run gulp sass first , then   uncomment below and remove the CSS includes above           -->                  <!-- cordova script  this will be a 404 during   development  -->                                                       Ionic Blank Starter                                            228  www.it-ebooks.info   4.  Add a footer by inserting a new footer component in the app:                    Footer           5.  Run the ionic serve command to see your changes right in the browser:  229  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  Let's make it more beautiful. Add a new card component:                                                Marty McFly               November 05, 1955                                  <img class="full-image"   src="http:  placehold.it 50x50">                               This is a "Facebook" styled Card. The header is   created from a Thumbnail List item, the content is from a card- body consisting of an image and paragraph text. The footer   consists of tabs, icons aligned left, within the card-footer.                                              1 Like                   5 Comments                                                                     Like                                                Comment                                                Share                                   230  www.it-ebooks.info   Take a look at the browser:  231  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… We started with exploring the basic directory structure of an Ionic project. Since this project  is built upon a PhoneGap Cordova project, we saw directories and files of the Ionic project  similar to projects in previous chapters. Then we examined the Ionic project files.  We then explored the Ionic configuration files. Ionic framework utilizes third-party tools to  improve development workflow. It uses Bower to manage frontend dependencies, GulpJS to  manage tasks, and npm to manage application dependency.  Then, we moved to the www directory, which contains the Ionic application. We added a footer  and card component to the index.html file. Adding UI components is a breeze in Ionic. Ionic  framework provides several ready-to-use UI components. We will explore UI in a later chapter.  See also   f Chapter 9, Ionic Framework Development  Using ngCordova ngCordova is an AngularJS extension on top of the Cordova API. This extension makes  building, testing, and deploying Angular JS–based Cordova applications easier. Since  Ionic framework is built upon AngularJS, we can utilize ngCordova to get easier access  to Cordova plugins' API. In this section, we are going to see how to use ngCordova along  with Ionic framework. We will use the $cordovaDialogs call dialog plugin API from the  Ionic application. The $cordovaDialogs plugin will display a native dialog box for each  corresponding platform.  How to do it... To get started using ngCordova, follow these steps:  1.  Start by downloading ngCordova. Go to http:  ngcordova.com  and click  on the download link. Alternatively, you can download it straight from the GitHub  repository by visiting https:  github.com driftyco ng-cordova archive  master.zip.  232  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Then unzip the newly downloaded file; so you have the following files:  3.  The file you need is dist ng-cordova.js or dist ng-cordova.min.js. The   .min version is just a minified version of the ngCordova library. Copy ng-cordova. js to be pasted into the Ionic application later.  4.  Create a new blank Ionic application project with the name myngCordova:  ionic start myngCordova blank  5.  Next, add the device platform into the project:  ionic platform add ios ionic platform add android  6.  Copy ng-cordova.js into the www js directory. 7.  Open the www index.html file and include ng-cordova.js in the JavaScript   reference before the cordova.js reference and after AngularJS Ionic:                   <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1,   maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width">                      233  www.it-ebooks.info       <!-- IF using Sass  run gulp sass first , then   uncomment below and remove the CSS includes above           -->                            <!-- cordova script  this will be a 404 during   development  -->                                                      Ionic Blank Starter                                       8.  Now add the dialog plugin:  ionic plugin add org.apache.cordova.dialogs  9.  The preparation is complete, so you can start writing some logics in the Ionic  application. Start by injecting the ngCordova dependency into the Ionic app.   To do this, open www js app.js. Then add ngCordova after the ionic   dependency as follows:    Ionic Starter App     angular.module is a global place for creating,   registering and retrieving Angular modules    'starter' is the name of this angular module example    also set in a   attribute in index.html     the 2nd parameter is an array of 'requires'  234  www.it-ebooks.info   angular.module 'starter', ['ionic', 'ngCordova']   .run function $ionicPlatform  {     $ionicPlatform.ready function   {            Hide the accessory bar by default  remove this   to show the accessory bar above the keyboard            for form inputs          if  window.cordova &&   window.cordova.plugins.Keyboard  {    cordova.plugins.Keyboard.hideKeyboardAccessoryBar true ;         }         if  window.StatusBar  {             StatusBar.styleDefault  ;         }     } ; }   10.  Then, add a new controller where you can write the application logic. At the end of   www js app.js, add the following code: .controller 'MyController', function $scope,   $cordovaDialogs  {  }   11.  Define where to use MyController in the view. Open www index.html, and then   add the ng-controller="MyController" attribute within the ion-pane tag:                  Ionic Blank Starter                       12. Now add a new button in the UI along with the ng-click event:                   Ionic Blank Starter                      <button ng-click="buttonClicked  "  class="button   button-block button-calm">             Touch me!!                    235  www.it-ebooks.info   13.  When the button is clicked or tapped, it will display a message. Here, JavaScript's   alert function will not be used. Add the buttonClicked   handler in the  controller to the call dialog plugin API: .controller 'MyController', function $scope,   $cordovaDialogs  {     $scope.buttonClicked = function   {         $cordovaDialogs.alert 'New message from ngCordova. This   is a native UI component', 'Alert', 'Ok'              .then function   {                    callback success             } ;     }; }   14.  Build the project and then emulate:  ionic build ios ionic emulate ios  get the following result:  15.  The application is now running on the emulator. Upon clicking on the button, you will   236  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… We started by downloading the ngCordova library from the official repository. Then we  created a new blank Ionic project and added device platform. After the project was generated,  we placed ng-cordova.js into the Ionic project directory which is placed in www js. ng- cordova.js reference is placed on index.html then.  After the preparation was complete, we injected the ngCordova dependency into our  AngularJS module so that the ngCordova module could be accessed. Then, we created a  controller that held our application's logic. Inside index.html, we defined which part of the  view is controlled by the newly created controller, MyController. We then added a button  along with the ng-click event handler.  Inside MyController, we created a new scope to handle the buttonClicked   event.  Then the alert   method of $cordovaDialogs was called. This method is used to display  alert dialogs using native UI component. We will see different outputs of dialog when running  the application on Android and iOS.

We will start by building a  single view application, and move on to a more complex tab-based application. Then, we will  cover the usage of AngularJS on the Ionic framework. We will explore routing, the controller,  and directives used in Ionic.  Exploring the UI components In this recipe, we will explore the UI components of the Ionic framework by building a sample  UI of settings.  How to do it… To get started, follow these steps:  1.  Create a new blank Ionic application project with the name as uiComponent:  ionic start uiComponent blank  239  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Change the directory to uiComponent:  cd uiComponent  3.  Then add the device platforms to the project:  ionic platform add ios ionic platform add android  4.  We open www index.html and clean   so that we have the following code:                   <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1,   maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width">                        <!-- IF using Sass  run gulp sass first , then   uncomment below and remove the CSS includes above           -->                  <!-- cordova script  this will be a 404 during   development  -->                                         Ionic uiComponent              5.  Let's add a header and give it a color:                   Ionic uiComponent           240  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  Then, we will add a footer and give it another color:                 Footer           7.  To place our content, we need to add a container for it. We can add the container   by adding div with the content class. As we are using a header in our view, we  must add the has-header class to the container. Let's add the container below   our header and above the footer:       8.   Inside the content, we will add a new list with items. We create a new container  with the list class, and then add several list items. The list items will have the   item class:                                  Check mail                   <a class="item item-icon-left item-icon-right"   href="">                Call Ma                                                   Record album                         Grammy                                              Friends              0                                                 Friends              0                     241  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  Then, we will add a list divider after the last list item. The list is indicated by the   item-divider class:              Friends      0          Activities    10.  We will place another list item after the divider, like this:        Activities                     Breaking Bad               Blue, yellow, pink                          Music               JT                          Games               Super Mario          11.  Start the Ionic server to preview the application by running the following line:  ionic serve  242  www.it-ebooks.info   Ionic will open the browser and run the app, as you can see here:  For more information about the UI components, visit   http:  ionicframework.com docs components .  243  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating a layout In the last recipe, we explored the Ionic UI components by creating a single-page application  using a blank starter template. In this recipe, we will create a clone of the Instagram mobile  app's layout.  How to do it… To start creating our own version of the Instagram UI, we follow these steps:  1.  Create a new tab Ionic application project with the name as ionSnap:  ionic start ionSnap tabs  2.  Change the directory to ionSnap:  cd ionSnap  3.  Then add the device platforms to the project:  ionic platform add ios ionic platform add android  4.  Let's change the tab name. Open www templates tabs.html and edit each   title attribute of ion-tab:       <ion-tab title="Timeline" icon-off="ion-ios-pulse"   icon-on="ion-ios-pulse-strong" href=" tab dash">                      <ion-tab title="Explore" icon-off="ion-ios-search"   icon-on="ion-ios-search" href=" tab chats">                      <ion-tab title="Profile" icon-off="ion-ios-person-outline"  icon-on="ion-person" href=" tab account">                     244  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  We have to clean our application to start a new tab-based application. Open www   templates tab-dash.html and clean the content so that you will have only the  following code:                  6.  Then, open www templates tab-chats.html and clean it up:  7.  Next, open www templates tab-account.html and clean that up as well:                                    8.  Open www js controllers.js and delete the methods inside the controllers.    So, we will have the following code: angular.module 'starter.controllers', []   .controller 'DashCtrl', function $scope  {}   .controller 'ChatsCtrl', function $scope, Chats  {  }   }   } ;  .controller 'ChatDetailCtrl', function $scope,   $stateParams, Chats  {  .controller 'AccountCtrl', function $scope  {  245  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  We have cleaned up our tabs application. If we run our application now, we will get   something like this:  10.  In the next step, we will create a layout for the timeline view. Each post of the timeline   will be displaying the username, an image, a like button, and a comment button.  Open www template tab-dash.html and add the following div list:                                                                     Some title                   November 05, 1955                                              <img class="full-image"   src="http:  placehold.it 500x500">                                        1 Like                       5 Comments                                   246  www.it-ebooks.info                                                          Like                                                            Comment                                                            Share                                                     Our timeline view will look like this:  247  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  Then, we will create an Explore page to display photos in a grid view. First, we need to   add some styles to our www css styles.css file: .profile ul {     list-style-type: none; }  .imageholder {     width: 100%;     height: auto;     display: block;     margin-left: auto;     margin-right: auto; }  .profile li img {     float: left;     border: 5px solid fff;     width: 30%;     height: 10%;     -webkit-transition: box-shadow 0.5s ease;        transition: box-shadow 0.5s ease; }  .profile li img:hover {     -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 7px rgba 255, 255, 255,   0.9 ;     box-shadow: 0px 0px 7px rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.9 ; }  12. Then we just put the list with the image item, like this:                                                                                       248  www.it-ebooks.info                                                                                       Now, our Explore page will look like this:  249  www.it-ebooks.info   13.  Lastly, we will create our profile page. The profile page consists of two parts. The first  one is the profile header. It shows user information, such as the username, the profile  picture, and the number of posts. The second part is a grid list of pictures uploaded  by the user. It's similar to the grid view on the Explore page.  14.  To add a profile header, open www css style.css and add the following styles   below the existing style: .text-white{   color:fff; }  .profile-pic {     width: 30%;     height: auto;     display: block;     margin-top: -50%;     margin-left: auto;     margin-right: auto;     margin-bottom: 20%;     border-radius: 4em 4em 4em   4em 4em; }  15.  Open www templates tab-account.html and then add the following code   inside ion-content:    <div class="user-profile"   style="width:100%;heigh:auto;background-color:fff;float:left;">                                                 <p class="text-white text-center" style="margin-top:- 15%;margin-bottom:10%;display:block;">@ionsnap, 6 Pictures                                 250  16.  The second part of the profile page is the grid list of user images. Let's add some  pictures under the profile header and before the end of the ion-content tag:                www.it-ebooks.info                                                                                             Our profile page will now look like this:  251  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… We created the app using the tabs template provided by the Ionic team. Using templates  can help us get started, especially when starting complex applications, such as a tab-based  application. We don't need to create a controller or a separate template, or set up the project.  However, the tab-based template needs to be cleaned up. That's why we cleaned up JavaScript  and HTML files first.  Then we started creating a layout for the timeline. The timeline consists of multiple photos,   and they are displayed in the card view. The timeline layout that we created may seem familiar.   It was similar to the Facebook card and the Instagram post. We started by creating a div with  the list and card classes. Then we added several div with the class item inside the card.  The second layout that we created was the Explore layout. The Explore layout shows a list  of pictures in a grid view. We defined a custom style for the profile class to display the  pictures in a grid view.  The last layout that we created was the profile page. We added a few profile-pic styles  to style.css to make a nice profile header. Then we added a list of user images under the  profile header. This list is just a copy of the image list in the Explore layout.  For more information on building layouts using the Ionic framework,  visit http:  ionicframework.com docs components .  Using Ionic and Angular In the last recipe, we created an Instagram clone layout using tab templates. We created   the layout using the components of the Ionic UI. We skipped the use of AngularJS in our app.  In this recipe, we are going to explore and take advantage of AngularJS's controllers, router,  and models in our Ionic application.  How to do it... To start taking advantage of AngularJS's features in an Ionic application, follow these steps:  1.  We will continue building the ionSnap app that we created in the previous recipe.   Open the terminal, change the directory to ionSnap, and run the Ionic server: cd path to ionSnap ionic serve  252  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Open www js app.js and examine it. The app.js is the main entry of our app.   There is a bunch of configurations, but for now, we will explore the router only. We can  configure each state of our app. Each state holds the configuration of the URL, which  template is used, and the name of the controller. The router configuration will look  like this: .state 'tab.dash', {     url: ' dash',     views: {         'tab-dash': {             templateUrl: 'templates tab-dash.html',             controller: 'DashCtrl'         }     } }   3.  Our timeline page uses the templates tab-dash.html template and the   DashCtrl controller. Open www js controllers.js, and you will find   DashCtrl. Let's add the posts model inside the DashCtrl controller: .controller 'DashCtrl', function $scope  {   $scope.posts = [     {title: 'First Title', date: 'January 05, 2015', image:   'http:  placehold.it 500x500', like: 1, comment: 5},     {title: 'Second Title', date: 'January 04, 2015', image:   'http:  placehold.it 510x510', like: 2, comment: 10},     {title: 'Third Title', date: 'January 03, 2015', image:   'http:  placehold.it 400x400', like: 5, comment: 9}   ]; }   4.  We have set up our model. Now, we will bind the model to view. To do this, open    www templates tab-dash.html and change the code to the following:                                              {{post.title}}               {{post.date}}                                                                   {{post.like}}   Like                   {{post.comment}}   Comments                           253  www.it-ebooks.info                                              Like                                                Comment                                                Share                                  5.  Run the app. Our timeline will now have three posts:  254  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  We will add another model to ChatsCtrl, which is the controller of the Explore   page. Open www js controllers.js and add the following models to  ChatsCtrl: .controller 'ChatsCtrl', function $scope, Chats  {     $scope.images = [     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 100x100'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 101x101'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 102x102'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 103x103'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 104x104'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 105x105'}     ]; }   7.  Then we bind the model to the Explore page. Open www templates tab-chats.  html and modify the list:                                                  255  www.it-ebooks.info   Our Explore page will look like this:  8.  Then we will add two models to the profile page: the userProfile model and the  images model. Open www js controllers.js and add the following models to  AccountCtrl: .controller 'AccountCtrl', function $scope  {   $scope.userProfile = {     username: '@ionsnap',     avatar: 'img ionic.png'     imageCount: 6   };    $scope.images = [     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 100x100'},  256  www.it-ebooks.info       {url: 'http:  placehold.it 101x101'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 102x102'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 103x103'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 104x104'},     {url: 'http:  placehold.it 105x105'}   ]; } ;  and change it to the following code:           9.  Next, we bind the models to the view. Open www templates tab-account.html     <div class="user-profile"   style="width:100%;heigh:auto;background-color:fff;float:left;">                                                 <p class="text-white text-center" style="margin-top:- 15%;margin-bottom:10%;display:block;">{{userProfile.username}},  {{userProfile.imageCount}} Pictures                                                                        257  www.it-ebooks.info   The profile page will now have something like what is shown in this screenshot:  How it works… We started by adding the posts model to DashCtrl. A model can be assigned using $scope.  We added the posts model to DashCtrl. We assigned it using $scope.posts. Once the  model is assigned to $scope, we can access it from the view. Since the posts model is an  array of objects, we take advantage of ng-repeat. We used ng-repeat="post in posts",  which means that Angular would loop each of the items on posts as post. To display the value  of the model, we used {{}}.  On the profile page, we assigned two models. The userProfile is an object that holds  information about the user. An object doesn't need ng-repeat in order to access the value.  We displayed username simply by calling {{userProfile.username}}.  For more information about AngularJS, visit   https:  docs.angularjs.org guide.  258  www.it-ebooks.info   Putting it all together In this recipe, we are going to dig deeper into using AngularJS with the Ionic framework.   We are going to add two common features to the existing ionSnap app. The first feature   is infinite scrolling, which loads more content whenever the user navigates to the bottom of  the list. The second feature is pull to refresh, which allows the user to refresh the content   by pulling from the top.  How to do it… To start adding more features into the existing ionSnap app, follow these steps:  1.  We will continue building the ionSnap app we created in an earlier recipe.    Open the terminal, change the directory to ionSnap, and run the Ionic server: cd path to ionSnap ionic serve  2.  Then open www templates tab-dash.html, and add the ion-infinite-  scroll directive before the ion-content close, as shown in this code:     <ion-infinite-scroll         on-infinite="loadMore  "         distance="1%">           3.  When the user reaches the end of the list, the loadMore   method from the   controller will be called. Open www js controller.js and add the loadMore  function after $scope.posts, like this: $scope.loadMore = function   {  };  4.   Inside the function, we will prepare dummy data as if it were fetched from the server: $scope.loadMore = function   {        var dataFetchedFromServer = {     title: 'Another Title',     date: 'January 05, 2015',     image: 'http:  placehold.it 500x500',     like: 1,     comment: 5       };  259  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  Then we will use JavaScript's setTimeout function to produce a delay before  appending a new post to the model. After appending a new post to the model,   we will send a broadcast message to inform AngularJS that the infiniteScroll  event is complete: setTimeout function  {           add dataFetchedFromServer to posts model        $scope.posts.push dataFetchedFromServer ;           send broadcast message to indicate the loading process  is complete        $scope.$broadcast 'scroll.infiniteScrollComplete' ; }, 3000 ;  Run the app. We will see the loading image at the bottom of the timeline, as shown in  this screenshot:  260  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  The second feature that we will be adding is pull to refresh. We will use the ion-  refresher directive in our timeline page. Open www templates tab-dash.html  and add the ion-refresher directive right after the opening of ion-content:                 <ion-refresher             pulling-text="Pull to refresh..."             on-refresh="doRefresh  ">            7.  When pull to refresh is triggered, the directive will call the doRefresh method to  handle the refresh. Let's create the doRefresh method on DashCtrl after the  loadMore method declaration: $scope.doRefresh = function   {  };  8.  Then we will use setTimeout to give a delay before resetting the model. After we are   done refreshing the model, we will send a broadcast message to inform AngularJS  that the refresh event is complete: $scope.doRefresh = function   {     var data = [{         title: 'First Title',         date: 'January 05, 2015',         image: 'http:  placehold.it 500x500',         like: 1,         comment: 5     }, {         title: 'Second Title',         date: 'January 04, 2015',         image: 'http:  placehold.it 510x510',         like: 2,         comment: 10     }, {         title: 'Third Title',         date: 'January 03, 2015',         image: 'http:  placehold.it 400x400',         like: 5,         comment: 9     }, {         title: 'Fourth Title',         date: 'January 03, 2015',         image: 'http:  placehold.it 400x400',  261  www.it-ebooks.info           like: 5,         comment: 9     }];      setTimeout function   {         $scope.posts = data;            Stop the ion-refresher from spinning         $scope.$broadcast 'scroll.refreshComplete' ;     }, 3000 ;  };  loading image like this:  9.  When we run the ionSnap and drag from the header to the bottom, we will see the   262  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… We added the infinite scrolling feature to our application. First, we added the ion- infinite-scroll directive and set the event to on-infinite="loadMore  ". Then we  created the implementation of loadMore   on DashCtrl. We assigned the method using  $scope.loadMore = function   {}.  Inside the function, instead of getting data from the server, we simulate the process using  setTimeout. After the process is complete, we send a $scope.$broadcast 'scroll. infiniteScrollComplete'  broadcast message to the framework so that the loading  animation disappears.  For more information about the API of infinite scrolling on the Ionic  framework, go to http:  ionicframework.com docs api  directive ionInfiniteScroll .  The second feature that we added is pull to refresh. For the first step, we added the ion- refresher directive and set the event to on-refresh="doRefresh  ". Then we  created the implementation of doRefresh on DashCtrl. Similar to the loadMore    method, we assigned the doRefresh method using $scope. Inside the doRefresh  method, we initialized fresh data to replace the current model. After the posts model was  replaced by the newly initialized fresh data, we sent a $scope.$broadcast 'scroll. infiniteScrollComplete'  broadcast message to stop the animation.  The complete list of ion-refresher APIs, such as changing the  loading animation, can be found at http:  ionicframework. com docs api directive ionRefresher .  263  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   10  User Interface  Development  In this chapter, we will cover these recipes:   f Creating a jQuery Mobile layout  f Persisting data between jQuery Mobile pages  f Using jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller  Introduction When we develop for mobile devices, we are extremely limited in terms of space, and we   have to think differently about creating a user interface or frontend for our application than   we would if we were creating it for the "big screen."  Users on mobile devices need information represented clearly and given to them in a format  and layout that is easily understandable and recognizable on smaller devices.  In this chapter, we will briefly look into creating a layout for a podcast application, and we  will be using the jQuery Mobile framework to do this. With its big, easily identifiable buttons,  elements, and interface, it gives us everything that we need to create a layout that almost  matches the designs of native apps.  265  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating a jQuery Mobile layout In this recipe, we will be creating a simple podcast application. It will obtain the available  shows from a remote XML feed and display them in a list on the main page.  We want the interface and elements to be easily recognizable and simple to use, which jQuery  Mobile can easily help us achieve.  Getting ready Before we start building our application, we need to ensure that we have the jQuery   Mobile framework.  Head over to http:  jquerymobile.com download  to download the latest code   as a .zip file.  We have options for including the code stored in a Content Distribution Network  CDN .  This means that the files are hosted on a remote server with a fairly high guarantee of their  availability at all times, without any server downtime.     266  www.it-ebooks.info   Using this method will help to reduce the overall size of our compiled application, as it will  mean that our app will not contain the files. They are not gargantuan in size, but when dealing  with mobile networks and data use, we want to consider the user by reducing the number of  external requests that they may have to make.  We also need to think about connectivity. The users of our application may not have a  constant connection to their network, and so we can't rely on remotely stored files. For this  reason alone, it is best that we include them in our application.  Once you have downloaded the archive, extract the files to a directory within your application  project folder. With this done, we can now get started with creating our jQuery Mobile application.  How to do it... We will use the jQuery Mobile framework to create the layout and user interface for our   mobile application:  1.  Create a new index.html file in the project folder, which will be your main application   2.   page. The head of the document will include a meta tag that defines the viewport to  assist in defining the structure of the page for use on mobile devices. Include the style sheet reference to the jQuery Mobile CSS file, and two JavaScript  references to the jQuery Mobile and jQuery core framework's .js files. Let's also  include the Cordova JavaScript file within the head tag:         <meta name="viewport" content="width=screen.width; user- scalable=no"  >     <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text html;   charset=utf-8">            <link href="jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css"   rel="stylesheet" type="text css"  >     <script src="jquery-1.11.1.min.js"   type="text javascript">      <script src="jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"   type="text javascript">            267  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Let's start adding jQuery Mobile-specific code. We'll begin by adding a new page to  our application. jQuery Mobile recognizes that certain aspects of the code should   be defined as a page by the data-role attribute specified within the div tag.  4.  Each of our pages will have a unique id attribute. Here, we'll call our page "home." 5.  Create a div tag block with data-role set to header, and a second with data-  role set to footer.  6.  We'll also create a new div tag with the data-role attribute set to content,   which declares the code within as the content for our page, between the header   and footer sections:                                CFHour Mobile                                   CFHour is the number 1 ColdFusion podcast.                                   &copy; cfhour.com                     7.  With very little code, we have created a simple application layout. Upon running the   application on a device, it will look something like this:  8.  As you can see, we have made extensive use of the HTML5 data attributes in our code.   jQuery Mobile uses these to define the layout, markup, and behavior of our code.  9.  Let's add a second page into our application. Below the current page definition,    we'll create a new div tag block with the data-role attribute set to page. Set the  id attribute for the page to about so that jQuery Mobile can differentiate this page  from the first.  268  www.it-ebooks.info   10.  We've also included the header, content, and footer sections, as these need to   be defined for each page:                  About CFHour                       CFHour is a weekly podcast primarily focused on   ColdFusion development, but brings you news and updates   about all things 'web'.           Join your hosts Dave Ferguson, Scott Stroz and   their producer Matt Gifford for the latest information,   live shows and guest interviews.                        <a href="http:  www.cfhour.com" data- role="button">Visit www.cfhour.com                                 &copy; cfhour.com           If you create an application with multiple pages in one file, jQuery Mobile  will display the first page that it encounters, in this case the home page.  It is important to remember that the order of content in your application  will have an effect on what is rendered.  11.  We now have our second page created, but we haven't yet created a way for the user  to navigate to it. Add an anchor tag within the header of the first page, home, and set  the href attribute to point to the second page by referencing its specific id attribute,  about. This creates an internal link, and jQuery will know exactly what to do.  12. We can also make use of the mobile framework to turn the standard link into a  button, and we'll add an icon from those included in the library to enhance the   user interface:                  CFHour Mobile   269  www.it-ebooks.info           <a href="about" data-role="button" data- icon="info">About     13.  We also need to give the user the option to navigate back to the home page. If their  mobile device has a back button, they can use it to switch back, but to enhance the  user experience, it's best that we provide them with the ability to do so from within  the application. Let's amend the About page's code to include this:                  About CFHour          <a href="" data-rel="back" class="ui-btn-left ui-btn   ui-icon-back ui-btn-icon-notext ui-shadow ui-corner-all"  data- role="button" role="button">Back         270  www.it-ebooks.info   14.  We now have our second page complete, with an automatically generated back   button, but as you can see in the screenshot of the application, we also have a lot   of empty space below the footer. Let's resolve this and set the footer to sit at the  bottom of the screen. Amend the footer div tag within each page by adding a new  data attribute, data-position, and set the value to fixed, like this:        &copy; cfhour.com     15.  We now have the header and footer fixed in their positions at the top and bottom  of the screen, respectively. This is cleaner for the user, provides a more consistent  layout, and also allows the user to scroll to the main content of the page and keep   the header and footer locked in position.  16.  If we run the application on our device now, the layout will look something like this:  271  www.it-ebooks.info   17.  When the user loads up the application, we want to provide them with a list of   available podcast episodes to listen to. We'll start off by revising the code in the   initial home page to include an unordered list:        CFHour is the number 1 ColdFusion podcast.       Select a show to listen to:            18.  We create a new script tag block at the bottom of the file to hold our custom code.  To begin with, we'll bind a pagecreate jQuery Mobile event to the home page, which  will run a new method called getRemoteFeed:       $ "home" .bind "pagecreate", function e  {         getRemoteFeed  ;     }     19.  The getRemoteFeed method will run a .get   jQuery method call to obtain the   contents of the podcast feed. When the XML data has been retrieved, we'll loop over  each item element  which represents an individual show  and generate a new list  item for each one. While building your list, you can see that you are adding elements from the feed as  data attributes to the list item, as well as the text for the link.  20. After looping through all available items, we append the complete string containing   our list items to the shortList unordered list element that we created earlier.  Finally, we need to refresh the list to allow jQuery Mobile to render the list elements  with the correct styles and formatting: var getRemoteFeed = function   {      $.get  "http:  feeds2.feedburner.com CfhourColdfusionPodcast",         {},         function data  {              var listItem = '';              $ data .find 'item' .each function  {                  listItem += '<li data-show-description="'                 + '" data-show-title="'   272  www.it-ebooks.info                   + $ this .find 'title' .text                    + '" data-enclosure="'                 + $ this .find "enclosure" .attr "url"                   +'" id="'+ $ this .find "guid"                   +'">  '                  + $ this .find 'title' .text                    + '   Released: '                 + $ this .find 'pubDate' .text     +'  ';             } ;              $ 'showList' .append listItem ;             $ "showList" .listview "refresh" ;         }      ; };  21.  Our main application page will now look something like what is shown in    this screenshot:  We defined the list to be inset. Had we left this attribute as default,  the list would have covered the entire width of the screen.  273  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… The jQuery Mobile framework gives developers the ability to create application layouts that  are responsive to the size of the device screen and provide an entire library of user interface  elements that aesthetically match a native application.  We were able to create a layout and define various sections and content simply by using data  attributes within the HTML. jQuery Mobile has been built to apply styles and events based on  the existence of these data attributes. This means that we only need to write well-structured  HTML code—we do not need to worry about diving too deeply into a new language or any  development framework that uses the model-view architecture.  Persisting data between jQuery Mobile pages In this recipe, we will build upon the podcast application built in the previous recipe, extending  the functionality and features available for the user.  So far, our podcast application consists of a few simple pages that are independent of each  other; that is, any content consumed by a page is used by that page only.  How to do it... We will use the localStorage capabilities to save and retrieve information, causing it to  persist across pages:  1.  With the list now populated, we need to revise the home method to include a function   to capture the tap events on each list item. This will obtain the title, enclosure,  and description attribute values from the selected item and set them in the  localStorage on the device so that we can cause them to persist on the next  screen. Then we'll force a page change to a new page called itemdetail: $ "home" .bind "pagecreate", function e  {     getRemoteFeed  ;     $ 'showList' .on 'click', 'li', function   {         localStorage.clear  ;         localStorage.setItem "enclosureURL",             $ this .attr 'data-enclosure'  ;         localStorage.setItem "showTitle",             $ this .attr 'data-show-title'  ;         localStorage.setItem "showDescription",             $ this .attr 'data-show-description'  ;          $.mobile.changePage 'itemdetail' ;  274  www.it-ebooks.info       } ;  }   3.   2.  Let's now create the new itemdetail page, which must sit in the code below the   initial home page. Remember that the order of the page content in your jQuery Mobile  application is important. We will leave the h1 tag within the header empty, as we'll  populate the title with the name of the show from localStorage. We have also added  another link button inside the header to open up a new page, showdescription.  This link differs from others that we have implemented as it opens the page in a dialog  window. This is because we have specified the data-rel attribute as dialog. In the contents of the page, we'll define the layout for the audio controls, which will  manage the playback of the remote audio file:                            <a href="showdescription" data-role="button" data- icon="info" data-rel="dialog" class="ui-btn-right">Description                                  Play           Pause           Stop                                          Current:  0   sec                                 Total:  0    sec                                 &copy; cfhour.com           4.  Let's now add the JavaScript controls for the audio to the script tag. We'll begin  by including a pagebeforeshow event bound to the itemdetail page. This will  obtain the mp3 remote URL and the show title from localStorage, and define the  playback controls for the audio player: $ "itemdetail" .bind "pagebeforeshow", function e  {  275  www.it-ebooks.info       var mp3URL = localStorage.getItem "enclosureURL" ;     var showTitle = localStorage.getItem "showTitle" ;      var audioMedia = null,         audioTimer = null,         duration = -1,         is_paused = false;  5.  We can now set the show title as the title for the page. Start applying the    audio controls: $ 'showTitle' .html showTitle ;  $ "playaudio" .live 'tap', function   {     if  audioMedia === null  {         $ "audio_duration" .html "0" ;         $ "audio_position" .html "Loading..." ;         audioMedia = new Media mp3URL, onSuccess, onError ;         audioMedia.play  ;     } else {         if  is_paused  {             is_paused = false;             audioMedia.play  ;         }     }      if  audioTimer === null  {         audioTimer = setInterval function   {             audioMedia.getCurrentPosition                  function position  {                     if  position > -1  {                 setAudioPosition Math.round position  ;                         if  duration <= 0  {                             duration =   audioMedia.getDuration  ;                             if  duration > 0  {                                 duration =   Math.round duration ;                        $ "audio_duration" .html duration ;                             }                         }                     }                 },                 function error  {  276  www.it-ebooks.info                       setAudioPosition "Error: " + error ;                 }              ;         }, 1000 ;     } } ;  function setAudioPosition position  {     $ "audio_position" .html position + " sec" ; }  6.   Include the success and error callback methods: function onSuccess   {     setAudioPosition duration ;     clearInterval audioTimer ;     audioTimer = null;     audioMedia = null;     is_paused = false;     duration = -1; }  function onError error  {     alert 'code: ' + error.code + '\n' +         'message: ' + error.message + '\n' ;     clearInterval audioTimer ;     audioTimer = null;     audioMedia = null;     is_paused = false;     setAudioPosition "0" ; }  7.  We'll now add the methods used to pause and stop the audio, as well as the   event handlers used to detect the tap action on the relevant control buttons   to run these functions: function pauseAudio   {         if  is_paused  return;         if  audioMedia  {             is_paused = true;             audioMedia.pause  ;         }     }      function stopAudio   {         if  audioMedia  {  277  www.it-ebooks.info               audioMedia.stop  ;             audioMedia.release  ;             audioMedia = null;         }         if  audioTimer  {             clearInterval audioTimer ;             audioTimer = null;         }          is_paused = false;         duration = 0;     }      $ "pauseaudio" .live 'tap', function   {         pauseAudio  ;     } ;      $ "stopaudio" .live 'tap', function   {         stopAudio  ;     } ;  } ;  We won't go into details about the audio functions here, as they are  covered in detail in Chapter 4, Working with Audio, Images, and Video,  in the Playing audio files from the local filesystem or over HTTP section.  8.  When you run the application on the device and select an episode from the list, the   show details page will look something like this:  278  www.it-ebooks.info   9.  Add a new page to the document and set the id attribute to showDescription.   We'll also set the id attribute of the content's div block to descriptionContent  and include an empty paragraph tag block, into which we'll insert the content  dynamically.  10.  Finally, we'll also include a link button that will close the dialog window for the user:                   Notes                                  Close           11.  Amend the .js file once more and include a new pagebeforeshow event binding to  the showDescription page. This will obtain the showDescription key value from  localStorage and set it in the empty paragraph tags:  $ "showdescription" .bind "pagebeforeshow", function e  {     var description = localStorage.getItem "showDescription" ;     $ 'descriptionContent p:first' .html description ; } ;  279  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... We were able to add functionality to the home page to set the touch interaction for each list  item. This set the values of the selected individual feed items in the device's localStorage,  which allowed us to access them using the localStorage getItem   method on a new  page, independent of the data feed.  We also altered the link to open the itemDetail page in a dialog window overlay by setting  the data-rel attribute for the link itself.  There's more...

This is managed by changing specific values   for the data-theme attribute in various elements and containers.  The framework itself ships with five built-in themes, or swatches, alphabetized from A to E.  For more information on theming your application, read the official  jQuery Mobile documentation at http:  demos.jquerymobile. com 1.4.5  and http:  api.jquerymobile.com .  280  www.it-ebooks.info   Although the provided themes work beautifully and care and consideration have gone into  them by the jQuery Mobile team with regards to readability and accessibility, these themes  should be considered as only a starting point and not a definitive design for our applications.  If you have spent time developing a bespoke native application that interacts with your data  and brand, you would also want to make sure that it stands out visually from the crowd and  doesn't look like an off-the-shelf theme. Make an impact, and make it individual.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will explore the features offered by jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller, an online  application that allows us to generate our own themes, or swatches, for our mobile application  using drag-and-drop interactions:  1.  Head over to http:  jquerymobile.com themeroller  to begin the creation   and customization of your swatches.  2.  The home page will load with a welcome message overlay box, which also reminds   you that you have the ability make 26 swatches in total. This should give you plenty of  scope to unleash your creative side and explore many color matches and possibilities.  Click on Get Rolling to dismiss the message.  281  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  The welcome message recommends that you create a minimum of three swatch   variations for your theme. As such, it has rendered three jQuery Mobile page layouts  for you to get started with. These are fully interactive so that you can see how your  theme looks and feels in a true application layout.  4.  To add more than three swatches to your theme, click on the empty layout holder in  the main preview panel. This will generate the next swatch and the name in the next  alphabetical order.  282  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  The left-hand side of the interface is home to the inspector panel. From here, you can   exercise control over the global theme settings, such as the font family, icon color,  and corner radii, as shown in the following screenshot. Any changes made to this  section will be applied to all the swatches in the preview section.  6.  Next to the Global tab, you also have access to changing theme settings for each  individual swatch. This can be accessed by the alphabetical character assigned to  each swatch. You can also add a new swatch from here using the + button, and it   will automatically be placed in the preview section.  283  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  You can even delete or duplicate a specific swatch from these tabs using the Delete   link or Duplicate link within each swatch tab respectively, as shown here:  8.  Adding colors to your theme is incredibly easy. Above the main preview content, you  will see a panel containing a number of color blocks and empty squares. To apply   a color to a section of the jQuery Mobile layout, simply drag the selected color block  from the panel and drop it onto the UI element on the swatch you wish to update.   The change will be applied instantly, and the selected color will be placed in the  Recent Colors palette for quick reference, should you wish to apply that color  elsewhere within the same swatch.  9.  You can also adjust the lightness and saturation of each color before applying it to  your theme by adjusting the sliders beneath the main palette display, as shown in   the following screenshot:  10.  If you need some color inspiration or want to see what color schemes other creative  professionals have developed, you can access the Adobe Kuler service by clicking on  the Adobe Kuler swatches link, which will display visual representations of the latest  swatches generated through the service. You can also filter for the most popular or  selected random themes.  284  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  Moreover, you can create your own free account with Adobe Kuler  now Adobe   Color CC  to start generating and sharing your own swatches. To find out more,   visit http:  kuler.adobe.com .  12. The toolbar at the top of the interface gives you instant access to some useful tasks   and features, including the undo and redo options, as shown in this screenshot:  13.  If you have an existing theme that you would like to amend or revise, you can import   it directly into the interface using the Import option. This will generate the correct  number of layouts for each swatch in the theme, and apply the styles to each one   so that you have an immediate visual representation of the theme.  285  www.it-ebooks.info   14.  A very useful tool is Inspector. Click on it to turn it on or off. When it is turned on, you  simply need to hover over a specific part of the layout and click on the selection. This  will open up the specific panel and tab in the Inspector panel on the left-hand side of  the interface. This is great for accessing the portion of the layout that you wish to edit  immediately.  15.  Once you are happy with your color choices, you can choose to download your   completed theme. This will package the relevant files in a .zip file, in both compressed  and uncompressed formats. Simply import the CSS files into your project location, and  include the reference to the style sheet within the head tags of your document, like this:  How it works... Using a simple online interface, we have the ability to create color swatches and themes   that better suit our applications' brand while still using the power offered by the jQuery   Mobile framework.  There's more... A framework is a framework, and offers a standard approach to fulfill common design   and development tasks. Themes generated by the ThemeRoller application  and indeed   the themes that come with the jQuery Mobile framework  still look like every other jQuery  Mobile theme—they do share common interface elements, after all.  286  www.it-ebooks.info   One thing to remember is that these themes are nothing more than CSS, and as such,   you can create truly bespoke layouts and designs with the right amount of skill, time, and  patience. Your mobile application need not look like a clone of every other application in   the marketplace that uses the same framework, and it can still retain the common user  interface elements that help define it as a mobile app.  For some inspiration on what you can achieve with some CSS, take a look at the JQM Gallery  site, which showcases some wonderful designs created using the jQuery Mobile framework at  http:  www.jqmgallery.com . A screenshot of this website is shown here:  287  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   11  Extending PhoneGap  with Plugins  In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:   f Extending your Cordova Android application with a native plugin  f Extending your Cordova iOS application with a native plugin  f The plugin repository  Introduction Along with providing developers with an incredibly easy yet powerful way to build native mobile  applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the PhoneGap framework also gives us the  ability to further extend the functionality by creating native plugins that can interact in more  detail with device features and functions that are not already exposed through the existing  Cordova plugin API.  By creating native plugins, we can enhance the already vast list of methods available through  the plugin API, or build totally unique features, all of which will be made available to call and  process responses from JavaScript methods.  For some, the thought of writing code that is native to the device platform that they wish to  enhance may be a little daunting. If you haven't had any prior exposure to or experience in  these languages, they may be perceived as a form of an unwelcome paradigm shift.  289  www.it-ebooks.info   Luckily, the Cordova API simplifies this process as much as possible and essentially   breaks it down into two core related parts: some JavaScript code for use within your HTML  applications, and a corresponding native class for performing actions and processes in the  native code. You will also have to edit and amend some XML to inform Cordova about your  plugin and grant permissions for its use, which is also incredibly simple. Cordova will manage  the communication between the two parts for you, so all that you have to worry about is  building your awesome applications.  Plugins compromise a single JavaScript API along with the corresponding native code for each  supported platform. So, we will have various pieces of native code, but we can call native code  using a single JavaScript interface.  Extending your Cordova Android application  with a native plugin Android devices have been proven to be developer friendly insofar as they easily allow us to  test and deploy unsigned applications throughout the development process.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will create a native Android plugin for our Cordova application, using  command-line tools as suggested by Cordova:  1.  Create a new directory named helloplugin. Then, create two blank directories,   www and src, from the root. Next, create an empty file called plugin.xml.   Now, we have a Cordova plugin project to get started, as shown here:  2.  We open plugin.xml and paste the following code for basic information about the   plugin that we are going to make:   <plugin xmlns="http:  www.phonegap.com ns plugins 1.0"         id="com.example.hello"         version="0.7.0">     Hello   290  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Create a new hello.js file inside the www directory. We have to make a reference            =3.4.0" >         from the newly created hello.js file to plugin.xml:        =3.4.0" >                  4.  Then, we need to create native Android code. Inside the src directory, create   another directory named android. Inside the android directory, create an   empty file named Hello.java. Again, we have to make a reference to the   newly created file in plugin.xml:                                           <param name="android-package"   value="com.example.plugin.Hello" >                    <source-file src="src android Hello.java" target-dir="src com  example plugin " >         291  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  Now, we have completed the plugin information through the plugin.xml file.    Open src android Hello.java and create a new class, called Hello,   that extends from CordovaPlugin: public class Hello extends CordovaPlugin {  6.  Add the package named com.example.plugin to the class, and import the    basic requirements for CordovaPlugin: package com.example.plugin;  import org.apache.cordova.*; import org.json.JSONArray; import org.json.JSONException;  public class Hello extends CordovaPlugin {  7.  Then, we will override the CordovaPlugin execute method to suit our    own implementation: public class Hello extends CordovaPlugin {   @Override     public boolean execute String action, JSONArray data,   CallbackContext callbackContext  throws JSONException {  }  }      } }  8.  We will create a greet action. This action will add the Hello string from the    given string input: public boolean execute String action, JSONArray data,   CallbackContext callbackContext  throws JSONException {      if  action.equals "greet"   {          String name = data.getString 0 ;         String message = "Hello, " + name;         callbackContext.success message ;          return true;      } else {  292  www.it-ebooks.info           return false;      } }  9.  We have now completed the Java for native Android code. The next step is to create a  JavaScript interface. Open www hello.js. We will add function invoke greet action  defined in our previous Java code: module.exports = {     greet: function  name, successCallback, errorCallback    {         cordova.exec successCallback, errorCallback,   "Hello", "greet", [name] ;     } };  10.  We are done creating an Android plugin, and we are ready to add our Hello plugin to  a Cordova application. First, we have to create a new Cordova application and add the  Android platform to the project: cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld  cd hello  cordova platform add android  11.  To add the plugin, we can simply use plugman. If you haven't installed plugman  yet, you can install it by running npm install -g plugman. Once plugman is  installed, run the plugman command from the terminal: plugman install --platform android --project hello platforms  android --plugin helloplugin  12. Once the plugin has been installed, head back to the Cordova application and open   www index.html. Clean it up and add the JavaScript reference of hello.js below  the cordova.js reference and above the js index.js reference:                             <meta name="format-detection"   content="telephone=no"  >         <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight"   content="no"  >         <!-- WARNING: for iOS 7, remove the width=device-width and  height=device-height attributes. See https:  issues.apache.org  jira browse CB-4323 -->  293  www.it-ebooks.info   13.  The next step is to call the JavaScript interface during the onDeviceReady event.           <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,   width=device-width, height=device-height, target- densitydpi=device-dpi"  >         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"   href="css index.css"  >          Hello World                       <script type="text javascript"   src="cordova.js">          <script type="text javascript"   src="hello.js">                      Open js index.js and add the following code to onDeviceReady: var app = {        Application Constructor     initialize: function   {         this.bindEvents  ;     },     bindEvents: function   {         document.addEventListener 'deviceready',   this.onDeviceReady, false ;     },     onDeviceReady: function   {         app.receivedEvent 'deviceready' ;         var success = function message  {             alert message ;         }          var failure = function   {             alert "Error calling Hello Plugin" ;         }          hello.greet "World", success, failure ;     },     receivedEvent: function id  {         var parentElement = document.getElementById id ;         var listeningElement =   parentElement.querySelector '.listening' ;  294  www.it-ebooks.info           var receivedElement = parentElement.querySelector '. received' ;          listeningElement.setAttribute 'style',   'display:none;' ;         receivedElement.setAttribute 'style',   'display:block;' ;          console.log 'Received Event: ' + id ;     } }; app.initialize  ;  14.  Build and run the project:  cordova build android  cordova run android  We will get an alert box like this:  295  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… We started by creating a new plugin project. There is no generator available, so we ourselves  created the plugin.xml file and the www and src directories to hold our project files. We  created the plugin definition for general information and the JavaScript module that will be  included when the application is built.  Then, we added the platform-specific plugin files. Platform-specific plugin files begin with the  platform attribute. Inside the platform attribute, we declared the package name and  filename that contains the native code.  After the plugin directory was prepared, we started writing the Java code required to hold  the native code for the Android platform. We created the Hello class, which extends  CordovaPlugin. Then, we implemented the execute method to detect the greet action  sent from the JavaScript interface. We appended the word "Hello, " to the string  parameter given by the JavaScript interface.  After we were done with the native Android code, we created the JavaScript interface.   Our Cordova application will call and execute the JavaScript code from this interface.   The Cordova core enables the JavaScript interface to call native code and then return   the call to JavaScript.  With the help of plugman, we added the hello Cordova plugin to our hello application.   The plugman makes the process of Cordova plugin development easier. We don't need   to register our plugin on any online Git repository.  For more information about developing your own Cordova plugin,  visit https:  cordova.apache.org docs en 4.0.0  guide_hybrid_plugins_index.md.html.  Extending your Cordova iOS application   with a native plugin  How to do it... In this recipe, we will create a native iOS plugin for our Cordova application using   command-line tools, as suggested by Cordova. We will implement the plugin for   Android that we created in the previous recipe to work with iOS:  296  www.it-ebooks.info   1.  Change the working project to helloplugin, open plugin.xml, and add   information about the new iOS platform:                                                 <header-file src="src ios HWPHello.h" target- dir="HelloPlugin" >     <source-file src="src ios HWPHello.m" target- dir="HelloPlugin" >         2.  Then create two blank files, HWPHello.h and HWPHello.m, inside the src ios   directory. Both files will contain our native Objective-C code for the iOS platform.  3.  Open HWPHello.h and paste the following code in it:  import    @interface HWPHello : CDVPlugin  -  void  greet: CDVInvokedUrlCommand* command;  @end  4.  We have created the HWPHello interface, so we need to create the class   implementation. Open HWPHello.m and paste this code in it: import "HWPHello.h"  @implementation HWPHello  -  void greet: CDVInvokedUrlCommand* command {      NSString* callbackId = [command callbackId];     NSString* name = [[command arguments] objectAtIndex:0];     NSString* msg = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"Hello,   %@", name];  297  www.it-ebooks.info       CDVPluginResult* result = [CDVPluginResult     resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_OK                                messageAsString:msg];      [self success:result callbackId:callbackId]; }  @end  5.  We have created our Hello Cordova plugin for the iOS platform. The next step is to   change the directory to the hello Cordova app and then add the iOS platform to the  project: cd hello  cordova platform add ios  6.  Then, we use plugman to install the iOS plugin that we created in our hello    Cordova project: plugman install --platform ios --project hello platforms ios  --plugin helloplugin  7.  Build and run the project:  cordova build ios  cordova emulate ios  as follows:  8.  We will have our hello Cordova application running and displaying an alert box,    298  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... In this recipe, we continued to work with the hello Cordova plugin. We created the plugin  implementation for iOS. We began by adding a platform element to plugin.xml. Inside the  platform element, we added references to native Objective-C code. The code consists of   the HWPHello.h header and the HWPHello.m implementation.  We included the dependencies of Cordova CDV.h inside the header file. Then we  created the HWPHello interface, which extends from CDVPlugin. Inside the HWPHello  interface, we created a new void method named greet. The greet method accepts  CDVInvokedUrlCommand as a parameter. After we were done creating the header file,   we created the implementation of the interface in HWPHello.m. Inside the greet method,  we appended the word "Hello, " to the string inputted by the JavaScript interface.  299  www.it-ebooks.info   Since we have created a JavaScript implementation in the previous recipe, we don't need  to create a new JavaScript implementation. All we have to do is add the plugin to our hello  Cordova project with the help of plugman.  The plugin repository Cordova enables developers to create their own plugin to extend hybrid application  capabilities. This plugin system enables hybrid applications to get native capabilities.   Almost any native functionality can be implemented using plugins.  Sometimes, creating our own plugin will take more time. We have to know each of the  platform's languages, create code specific to each platform, and then create a JavaScript  interface to make it work with an HTML application. It would be easier for us to use an   existing plugin or an open source Cordova plugin.  Luckily, there is a centralized repository of Cordova plugins. We can search for the plugin   we need and then add it to our Cordova application.  How to do it… To search and use a Cordova plugin from the repository, follow these steps:  1.  Open http:  plugins.cordova.io  , and you will see a search box to start   searching for a plugin, like this:  300  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Let's find a plugin for implementing local notifications for the Cordova application.   We type the notification keyword in the search box, and then hit Enter so that   we can see a list of notification plugins available, along with a brief description of  each plugin, as shown here:  301  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Now we find the local notification plugin named with the package name as com. cordova.plugin.localnotificationplugin. Open the link and you will   see the plugin information page, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  All we have to do is add the plugin to our application:  cordova plugin add com.cordova.plugin.localnotificationplugin  5.  After we are done adding the plugin to the application, we only need to call the   JavaScript API, as the plugin description says.  How it works… We started by visiting the official Cordova plugin registry at http:  plugins.cordova.io.  Then we searched for the local notification plugin using the notification keyword. Once  we found the plugin, we opened the plugin page. Then we added the plugin to the Cordova  application using the cordova plugin add   command.  302  www.it-ebooks.info   12  Development Tools   and Testing  In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:   f Downloading Cordova  f Using the command line to create a new iOS Cordova application  f Debugging the iOS Cordova application using Safari Web Inspector  f Using Android Studio to develop Android Cordova applications  f Using Adobe Dreamweaver to develop Cordova applications  f Using the PhoneGap Build service  Introduction To successfully create your Cordova applications, it is really important to set up the correct  development environment—one that suits the requirements of your application, your personal  development style, and the tools and features that you may need to use, and one that is  compatible with your local development machine's operating system.  In this chapter, we will investigate some of the options available for setting up your local  environment with development tools in order to assist you and help make developing your  mobile applications even easier.  303  www.it-ebooks.info   Downloading Cordova Before we develop any Cordova applications, we need to download a copy of the framework,   of course.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will download the Cordova framework to make sure that we have the  framework available to start local development:  1.  Cordova needs Node.js to be installed first. Head over to https:  nodejs.org   en download  and download the installer for your machine, as shown here:  304  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Download Cordova by running the following command on your terminal or    Command Prompt: npm install -g cordova  3.  Check your Cordova installation by running cordova —v. You will see something    like this if Cordova is installed correctly:  How it works... We installed Node.js from the official site. Then we used the Node Package Manager to  download and install Cordova.  Using the command line to create a new iOS  Cordova project A streamlined workflow is something that can benefit us all greatly by speeding up our  processes and reducing the amount of manual work needed to complete a task.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will explore the command-line tools available in Cordova for creating and  running iOS applications from the terminal application:  1.  Create a new Cordova iOS project by running the following command:  cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld  305  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Change the directory to the newly created project:  cd hello  3.  Add the iOS platform to the project:  cordova platform add ios  4.  Open the project directory in the explorer, and you should see something like this:  306  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  Open the  platform ios directory and double-click on HelloWorld.xcodeproj.   So, the project will be opened in Xcode, as shown here:  307  www.it-ebooks.info   6.   If we choose to run the newly opened project via Xcode on a simulated device, the  output will look something like this:  How it works... The command-line tools available in Cordova greatly simplify the tasks involved in creating a  project. With a simple command, we can generate a complete project—complete with the www  directory linked at a project level, and ready to open up in Xcode to continue our development.  The create command accepts three parameters:   f The path to your iOS project  f The name of the package  f The project name  308  www.it-ebooks.info   There's more... The usage of the command line is incredibly powerful, and it can allow developers to  automate the creation of a project by running a very simple script. However, that's not   the only tool available for use through the command line.  To see all the available commands in command-line tools, visit  http:  cordova.apache.org docs en 5.1.1 .  Running the application on the iOS Simulator We can run the emulate script from the command line via the Terminal app to launch our  application on a simulated device.  For the emulation to work successfully on OS X, you will need to install a command-line utility  tool called ios-sim, an open source project that launches the built application on the iOS  simulator. You can download ios-sim from the GitHub repository at https:  github.com  phonegap ios-sim.  The readme file in this repository has short, detailed instructions explaining how to install ios- sim on your machine.  Once the installation is done, simply run the emulate script to load the application onto the  iOS Simulator. To do so, simply type the path to the cordova directory within your project  folder and run the cordova emulate ios script.  When you run this command for the first time, the script will ascertain whether or not you  currently have a successfully built version of the application. If not, it will ask you whether or  not you would like the build process to take place.  Debugging your application When running an application on a simulator using Xcode, we are able to catch the console. log message directly from Xcode. Another option is to use Safari to debug and inspect your  running application.  309  www.it-ebooks.info   Debugging the iOS Cordova application  using Safari Web Inspector Debugging iOS Cordova can be done just like debugging a normal web application. We can  catch network activities, inspect elements, and see the console logging.  How to do it… To start debugging a iOS Cordova application, follow these steps:  1.  Open and run the HelloWorld project created before using Xcode. 2.  While the application is running on the simulator, open Safari. Go to Develop  iOS   Simulator  index.html, as shown in the following screenshot:  310  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  We can inspect the element and check out Local Storage and Session Storage by   choosing the Resources tab, as follows:  4.  We can see the network activities on the Timelines tab, as shown in this screenshot:  5.  To see the output on the browser's JavaScript console, click on the Console tab.  311  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works… We opened the iOS Cordova application in Xcode. Then we ran the application on a simulator.  While the application was being run on the simulator, we opened Safari and chose Web  Inspector. Safari connects to the emulator's Safari to make the debugging process easier. The  debugging process is practically the same as debugging common web or HTML5 applications.  Using Android Studio to develop Android  Cordova applications Android Studio is the official IDE for developing Android applications, based on IntelliJ IDEA.   It provides an easier workflow to develop Android applications compared to using Eclipse.  Getting ready Opening an Android Cordova application is very simple:  1.  Download Android Studio from http:  developer.android.com sdk index.  html, as shown in this screenshot:  312  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Launch Android Studio. 3.  Select Import project  Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc. , as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  For the Gradle Sync question, you can simply answer Yes. 5.  Select the location where the android platform is stored  phonegap-cookbook   chapter12 hello platforms android .  313  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  Your application is ready and can be run directly from Android Studio.  For more information about building using Android Studio, visit  http:  developer.android.com tools building  building-studio.html.  Using Adobe Dreamweaver to develop  Cordova applications Adobe Dreamweaver has long been a favorite tool of web designers and developers.  Dreamweaver CS5 included features that assisted building mobile applications and the   ability to simulate and package PhoneGap applications without having to worry about the  underlying framework library.  Dreamweaver CS6 took this one step further and integrated an automated Build service   in the form of PhoneGap Build.  Getting ready To use the PhoneGap Build service, you will first need an active PhoneGap Build service  account, which is free and incredibly easy to set up:  1.  Head over to https:  build.phonegap.com people sign_in to begin the   registration process. You can sign in using either your Adobe ID or your GitHub  account details, as shown here:  314  www.it-ebooks.info   That's it! It's time to start building an application using Dreamweaver CS6.  If you do not have a copy of Dreamweaver CS6, you can download  a full-featured trial version from http:  www.adobe.com uk  products dreamweaver.html.  315  www.it-ebooks.info   How to do it... In this recipe, we will use Dreamweaver CS6 to create a simple application, which we will pass  to the PhoneGap Build service to build for us:  1.  To manage our Cordova application in Dreamweaver CS6, we need to create a new  Dreamweaver site definition, pointing the project directory to our preferred location  on our development machine.  2.  We'll simplify the creation of our application's structure and download a    project template that contains all the core files that we will need. Head over to  https:  github.com phonegap phonegap-start and click on the ZIP   button to download a compressed version of the code. Alternatively, you can   clone the GitHub project directly on your local machine using the command line.  316  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Move or copy the extracted files to the location of your Dreamweaver project.    The resulting project structure should look something like this:  4.  Open index.html in the editor window. There are some JavaScript assets included  in the head of the document, one of which is called cordova-2.0.0.js. However,  you may notice that the file does not actually exist in the project itself.  When dealing with the PhoneGap Build service, you do not need to have  a local copy of the PhoneGap Cordova JavaScript file, but you do need  to reference it in the document. This is because the service needs it to  successfully build your application.  317  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  Open the config.xml file in the editor window, which holds the configuration details  for our application. Change the id attribute value to a reverse-domain value specific  to you.  6.  We'll also change the name value to that of our application, and change the author   node to set the developer information with our URL, e-mail address, and name:   <widget xmlns=http:  www.w3.org ns widgets xmlns:gap=http:  phonegap.com ns 1.0 id="com.coldfumonkeh.mycordovaapp" version="1.0.0">   My Cordova Application   Matt   Gifford   7.  We can request that our application be built using a particular version of the   PhoneGap library. Although the Build service will use the default version  currently  2.0.0 , you can also enforce this by setting a preference tag to confirm that you  want to use that version:    8.  Then, there is the feature node in the config.xml file, which specifies the   features you want your application to use and have access to. This sample application  requests access to the device API. Let's add two more feature nodes to request  access to the geolocation and network connectivity APIs, like this:      For detailed information about all the parameters and values available for  use in the config.xml file, visit the PhoneGap Build documentation at  https:  build.phonegap.com docs config-xml.  9.  Save the config.xml file, and open the PhoneGap Build service window by going to  Site  PhoneGap Build Service  PhoneGap Build Service from the main application  menu. This will open the Build service window in Dreamweaver. If this is the first time  you are running this process within Dreamweaver, you will be asked to enter your  PhoneGap Build account credentials to log in and use the remote service, as shown  in the following screenshot:  318  www.it-ebooks.info   10.  Once logged in, you will be presented with the Build service panel, which will inform   you that a project settings file needs to be built for this application. Ensure that  Create as a new project is selected in the drop-down box, and click on Continue   to start the build process, as shown in this screenshot:  11.  Dreamweaver will now submit your application to the remote PhoneGap Build service.   You can view the process of each build from the panel in the editor.  If you receive any build errors, make sure that the id value in the  config.xml file does not contain any underscores or invalid characters,  and that there are no spaces within the xml node names and values.  319  www.it-ebooks.info   12. Once the build process is complete, you will be shown the results for each mobile   platform, like this:  13.  You will be presented with the option to download the packaged application in the   respective native format by clicking on the downward-facing arrow. You can then  install the application on your device for testing.  14.  If your mobile device has a Quick Response  QR  Code Reader, you can select the  barcode button and scan the resulting image shown to you. This will download the  application directly on the device without any need of USB connectivity or transfers.  320  www.it-ebooks.info   15.  In this example, the iOS application was not built as no signing key was provided in   the config.xml file.  For more details on iOS code signing, check out the official  documentation from the iOS Developer Library at http:   developer.apple.com library ios technotes  tn2250 _index.html.  16.  You may also notice that the Android platform have an extra button—the right-facing   arrow. Clicking on this button will load the application onto a local emulator for   testing purposes.  17.  To use emulators on your local machine, Dreamweaver needs to know the location  of the SDK libraries. To set these paths, open the PhoneGap Build Settings panel,  which you can reach by going to Site  PhoneGap Build Service  PhoneGap Build  Settings from the main menu, as shown in this screenshot:  18.  Include the path to the SDKs that you have installed and wish to use, and click on   Save to store them.  321  www.it-ebooks.info   How it works... The integration of the PhoneGap Build automated service directly into Dreamweaver CS6  helps manage the packaging and building of your application across a number of device  platforms. The build process takes care of the device permissions and inclusion of the   correct Cordova JavaScript file for each platform.  This means that you can spend more time developing your feature-rich native application and  perfecting your layouts and visuals, without having to handle the various build processes and  differences between each platform.  Using the PhoneGap Build service A benefit of the Cordova project is the ability to create a native application from an HTML  file and a little JavaScript, at its very minimum. Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 has the built-in  capabilities to interact with and upload your mobile project directly on the remote PhoneGap  Build service on your behalf. You can, however, build your application using the service directly  via the Web.  Getting ready To use the PhoneGap Build service, you will first need an active PhoneGap Build service  account, which is free and incredibly easy to set up:  1.  Head over to https:  build.phonegap.com people sign_up to begin the   registration process. You can sign in using either your Adobe ID or your GitHub  account details, as shown here:  322  www.it-ebooks.info   How to do it... In this recipe we will create a very simple single-file application and upload it to the Build  service using the web interface:  1.  Create a new index.html file, and include the following code in it:          <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,     initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,     minimum-scale=1, width=device-width;"  >    Cordova Application   323  www.it-ebooks.info     <script type="text javascript"        src="cordova.js">           function onLoad   {       document.addEventListener "deviceready",   onDeviceReady, false ;     }      function onDeviceReady   {       alert 'Cordova has loaded' ;     }              Welcome to Cordova      What will you create?        In this file, we have included a reference to cordova.js in the head of the  document. This file does not exist locally, but the Build service requires this   reference to successfully build the application. We have created a very simple  function that will generate an alert notification window once the device is ready.  2.  We create a new .zip file that contains the index.html file we just created. We will   use this archive file to send to the PhoneGap Build service to create our application.  3.  Head over to https:  build.phonegap.com , and sign in with your account  details if you haven't done so already. If this is your first visit, or you have not yet  submitted any application to the service, you will be greeted with a form to help you  generate your first build.  4.  You have the option to create either an open source or a private application. Both  options give you the ability to provide code as either a link to a Git repository or an  archived .ZIP file. For the purposes of this recipe, we will select the Upload a .zip  file button. We navigate to the archived file that we created earlier, select it, and click  on Open to proceed. The PhoneGap Build service will instantly upload our code and  create a new project, as shown here:  324  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  As we have not included a config.xml file in the upload, the application title and   description are placeholders. Click on the Enter your app title text and enter the  title or name of your application in the input box, making it easily identifiable so that  you can distinguish it from any other apps that you may upload. You can also add a  description for your application in the same manner.  6.  Let's also select the ability to debug our application, as shown in this screenshot:  7.  Click on the Ready to build button in the bottom-right corner of the screen layout.   The build process will now begin, and you will be presented with a visual reference   to the available platforms and the status of each build, like this:  325  www.it-ebooks.info   8.   In this example, four of the six builds were successful. The iOS and BlackBerry builds  were not, as iOS needed a signing key and BlackBerry was unable to verify the  application's passwords.  9.  Click on the title of the application, which will take you to a new page with the options   to download the successfully built packages, as shown in the following screenshot:  10.  You can download the applications using the direct download link next to each  successful build listing; or if your device has a QR Code Reader, you can scan   the barcode to download and install the application directly on the device.  How it works... The PhoneGap Build service automates the packaging process for your mobile application  across the available device platforms, which greatly simplifies your workflow and the task   of preparing configuration files for each individual platform.  There's more... When we created this sample application using the online Build service, we chose to enable  debugging. This is another online service offered by the PhoneGap team, and it makes use of   an open source debugging application called weinre, which stands for Web Inspector Remote.  326  www.it-ebooks.info   To see it in action, you need to have the application packaged by the PhoneGap Build service  running on a physical device attached to your local development machine, or on a device  emulator. Once you have the application running, click on the debug button at the top of   your project page, as shown here:  This will open a new window or tab in your browser using the debug.phonegap.com  subdomain, and you should see your connected device in the list, as shown in the   following screenshot:  For developers who have used development tools such as Firebug, the tools on offer with  weinre should look very familiar. It provides similar functionality to test and debug HTML  applications inline, but is designed to work remotely and is exceedingly good at testing   apps and pages on mobile devices.  To find out more about the features and functions available in weinre,  check out the official documentation at http:  people.apache. org ~pmuellr weinre .  The PhoneGap Build documentation also provides an introduction to the service with an  emphasis on using it with the online Build service, at https:  build.phonegap.com  docs phonegap-debug.  Hydrating your application PhoneGap Build also provides a tool to enhance the workflow and deployment of compiled  applications on your devices for testing, called Hydration. This reduces the time taken to  compile an application and automatically pushes a new build of a "Hydrated" app onto   the device. Hydration can be enabled while creating a new project, or the settings can be  updated and applied to an existing project.  327  www.it-ebooks.info   To apply Hydration to your current application, select the Settings tab within the project  view and click on the enable hydration button. Then click on the Save button to retain the  changes. At this point, the application will automatically rebuild as a hydrated app.  Install or deploy the freshly compiled application on your device, replacing any previous non- hydrated version that you may already be having.  The benefit of such an application is the ease and simplicity of deploying further updates.  Once any future code has been updated, deployed, and compiled in the Build service, you can  easily update your installed version by restarting the application on the device. The Hydrated  application will check on every startup whether an updated version of the app exists, and if so,  it will prompt the user with a dialog box offering a chance to update the application, like this:  328  www.it-ebooks.info   If accepted, the new build will be downloaded and installed directly on the device,   as shown here:  To find out more about the Hydration service, check out the official  documentation, which is available at https:  build.phonegap.com  docs hydration.  The PhoneGap Build API The online PhoneGap Build service is also available via an exposed public Application  Programming Interface  API .  329  www.it-ebooks.info   By opening the Build service as an API, developers get the ability to create, build, update, and  download PhoneGap applications from shell scripts, the command line, a separate automated  Build process, or a source control post commit hook process.  Read and write access to the service is available by using authentication protocols.  To learn more about the PhoneGap Build API, check out the official  documentation at https:  build.phonegap.com docs api.  330  www.it-ebooks.info   sensor update interval, adjusting  24-29 used, for
