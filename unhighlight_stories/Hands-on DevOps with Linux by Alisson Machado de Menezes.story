In	 my	 perspective,	 we	 can consider	 some	 revolution	 in	 IT	 when	 we	 stop	 creating	 boundaries	 among	 IT teams	 and	 start	 collaborating	 and	 working	 together,	 aiming	 for	 a	 common objective.	Apart	from	that,	we	have	all	the	technical	stuff	which	are	included	in the	 DevOps	 mindset,	 using	 automation	 to	 speed	 up	 the	 time	 to	 market	 and delivery	faster,	high-quality	software	and	services. I	came	into	DevOps	because	of	my	curiosity	regarding	everything	in	IT.	I	started when	I	was	a	teenager,	studying	cybersecurity,	because	I	wanted	to	be	a	Hacker, like	 all	 geeks	 when	 they	 start	 with	 IT.	 Then	 I	 studied	 operating	 systems, computer	 programming,	 databases,	 network,	 security,	 etc.	 These	 terms prepareded	me	when	DevOps	came	into	the	picture. Today,	the	DevOps	engineers	must	possess	all	these	skills.	In	my	daily	work,	for example,	I	have	to	create	scripts	to	automate	the	cloud	servers	installation,	which can	 be	 done	 in	 many	 different	 ways.	 Mostly,	 I	 use	 Python	 for	 my	 automation when	it	is	something	very	specific.	For	more	generic	scenarios,	I	use	Ansible.	I use	Jenkins	for	scheduling	automation,	creating	pipelines,	and	many	other	tools. I	 also	 wrote	 some	 other	 courses	 when	 I	 was	 living	 in	 Brazil,	 which	 included MongoDB,	DevSecOps,	Python	Development,	Docker	and	OpenShift,	and	Agile Infrastructure.	In	the	ten	years	working	there,	I	worked	in	different	companies, in	different	scenarios,	like	web	hosting,	e-commerce	development,	open-source consultant,	EdTech’s,	and	payment	gateways. Today,	my	position	is	Big	Data	DevOps	Engineer,	wherein	I	apply	my	DevOps knowledge	about	automation	into	a	Big	Data	scenario,	to	create	pipelines,	and automation	to	create	data	lakes,	data	pipelines,	automating	governance	rules,	etc. The	primary	goal	of	this	book	is	to	provide	the	information	and	skills	necessary to	work	in	today’s	market	as	a	DevOps	Engineer,	giving	you	the	basic	overview and	steps	of	the	most	used	technologies,	based	on	my	ten	years	of	experience: Chapter	 1	 This	 chapter	 introduces	 you	 with	 the	 the	 virtualization	 concept	 on your	 local	 machine	 aiming	 for	 you	 to	 create	 your	 labs,	 test	 your	 new technologies,	 simulate	 environments	 without	 crashing	 anything	 in	 production, and	for	your	studying	purposes. Chapter	2	This	chapter	explains	you	about	some	basic	bash	commands,	because   we	know	that	nowadays	Linux	is	not	a	differential	anymore,	rather	a	requirement for	those	who	work	with	Cloud	and	High	Availability. Chapter	 3	 Here,	 we	 set	 up	 some	 services,	 like	 a	 database	 and	 a	 web	 server bringing	up	the	most	common	installation,	what	we	call	Lamp	 Linux	Apache Mysql	PHP . Chapter	4	Reverse	proxy	is	commonly	used	when	you	have	just	one	public	IP, and	you	have	different	sites	running	behind	a	private	structure.	When	you	are	not using	 cloud	 services,	 like	 Azure	 or	 Amazon,	 you	 can	 either	 set	 up	 your	 own Nginx	 and	 make	 the	 load	 balance,	 or	 you	 can	 pass	 your	 connections	 to	 the private	servers	enforcing	the	security. Chapter	 5	 Docker	 is	 one	 of	 the	 leading	 technologies	 of	 a	 DevOps	 engineer stack.	 Here,	 we	 will	 learn	 the	 very	 basics,	 but	 enough	 for	 you	 to	 create	 your images	and	commit	them	to	a	registry	for	a	deployment. Chapter	 6	 Vagrant	 is	 also	 one	 very	 useful	 tool	 for	 those	 who	 are	 not	 using Docker	 yet.	 We	 know	 that	 many	 companies	 are	 still	 using	 on	 premise infrastructure.	 It	 also	 needs	 to	 be	 automated.	 Somehow,	 this	 chapter	 aims	 to teach	you	how	to	create	your	automation	scripts. Chapter	 7	 After	 working	 on	 your	 laptop,	 this	 chapter	 will	 teach	 you	 how	 to create	the	labs	and	infrastructure	using	Cloud	Services	and	the	CLI	 Command- line	interface ,	with	a	focus	on	automation. Chapter	 8	 Multicloud	 is	 one	 topic	 that	 we	 cannot	 avoid.	 After	 learning	 the command-line	 interfaces	 and	 the	 differences	 among	 the	 different	 cloud providers,	 Terraform	 will	 give	 you	 a	 single	 workflow	 to	 create	 your infrastructure	on	any	provider. Chapter	9	At	this	point,	we	have	created	a	lot	of	code.	Therefore,	we	need	to use	Git	to	save	it	and	also	created	documentation	and	different	versions	of	our infrastructure. Chapter	 10	 Pipelines	 is	 a	 way	 to	 create	 a	 workflow	 on	 your	 automation, defining	dependencies,	step-by-step,	Jenkins	is	the	most	famous	open	source	tool for	it,	and	in	this	chapter,	we	will	learn	more	about	it. Chapter	 11	 In	 my	 perspective,	 Kubernetes	 will	 become	 the	 standard	 way	 of application	deployment,	and	then	I	could	not	write	a	book	without	giving	you	at least	the	basics	of	it. Chapter	12	Once	all	your	infrastructure	is	ready	to	be	scaled	and	automated,	we need	to	find	a	way	to	centralize	the	logs	because	when	you	have	a	few	servers, you	can	go	one-by-one	and	check	the	logs.	But	when	we	have	planter	thousands   of	 servers,	 creating	 automated	 we	 must	 centralize	 the	 logs	 in	 the	 server	 for audition	purposes	and	debugging,	the	Elasticsearch,	Fluend,	and	Kibana	are	the references	for	it.

In	my	view,	if	you	bought	this	book,	you	probably	have	a	basic	idea	of	what	is Linux	and	you	already	know	why	you	want	to	learn	it.	Thus	summarizing,	Linux is	 an	 operating	 system	 with	 an	 open-source	 code,	 and	 works	 similar	 to	 the famous	Windows,	but	it	does	not	belong	to	any	company.	So,	how	is	the	code open?	 Everyone	 site: https:  www.kernel.org ,	 and	 if	 you	 are	 interested	 to	 give	 a	 look	 around	 the source	code,	it	can	be	found	on	this	link	https:  git.kernel.org . Linux	has	this	name	because	of	its	creator,	Linus	Torvalds.	The	first	3	letters	are the	initials	of	Linus,	and	the	last	2	come	from	another	OS,	called	Minix,	created by	a	man,	named	Andrew	Tanenbaum. It	 is	 common	 for	 you	 to	 see	 Linux	 bound	 to	 other	 initials,	 like	 GNU.	 This happens	because	when	Linus	Torvalds	was	creating	Linux,	he	used	many	tools that	were	created	by	the	GNU	project,	https:  www.gnu.org home.en.html.	The GNU	 project	 began	 with	 Richard	 Stallman,	 the	 creator	 of	 the	 Free	 Software Foundation,	https:  www.fsf.org.	What	does	it	mean	to	license	an	open-source? It	means	that	every	software	written	by	the	GNU	project	has	its	code	open	for everyone	 who	 wants	 to	 work	 on	 it.	 Then,	 how	 Linus	 Torvalds	 used	 the	 tools from	 the	 GNU	 project?	 He	 decided	 to	 use	 the	 same	 philosophy	 of	 the	 open- source	and	he	released	the	Linux	system	with	the	tools	from	the	GNU	project. This	explains	the	term	GNU Linux.  Distributions Since	 Linux	 is	 open-source,	 a	 lot	 of	 people	 and	 companies	 created	 their	 own versions	 of	 Linux,	 which	 are	 called	 distributions.	 Everyone	 who	 has	 the knowledge	 in	 computer	 programming	 can	 make	 their	 own	 Linux	 distribution. One	 example	 is	 Kurumin	 Linux,	 created	 by	 a	 Brazilian	 programmer,	 Carlos Morimoto,	 and	 can	 be	 found	 on	 the	 link,	 https:  distrowatch.com table.php? distribution=kurumin.	 Unfortunately,	 it	 is	 discontinued,	 because	 maintaining your	 own	 distribution	 is	 not	 an	 easy	 task.	 You	 have	 to	 be	 concerned	 about updates,	new	releases,	new	software,	bug	correction,	and	infinite	things	that	are basically	impossible	for	just	one	person	to	take	all	that	effort	and	without	being   paid	for	it.	So,	it	is	one	important	topic	for	you	to	decide	what	distribution	you are	 planning	 to	 install	 in	 your	 infrastructure.	 Imagine	 the	 situation	 where	 you began	 with	 one	 distribution.	 A	 year	 later,	 it	 is	 discontinued	 and	 you	 have	 to reinstall	 your	 whole	 infrastructure	 with	 more	 than	 300	 servers.	 We,	 as professionals,	cannot	let	this	happen. Regarding	the	distribution	we	want	to	choose	for	our	infrastructure,	there	exists several	of	them,	but	some	are	the	mostly	used,	because	of	the	reasons	I	am	going to	explain	further:  RedHat	 Enterprise	 Linux:	 This	 is	 the	 most	 famous	 and	 corporative distribution	because	of	the	RedHat	Company.	It	is	one	of	the	most	famous companies	in	the	Linux	world.	It	has	amazing	support,	frequent	updates, and	100%	compatibility	with	the	RedHat	software,	like	JBoss,	OpenStack, RedHat	Enterprise	Virtualization	Manager,	and	a	lot	of	more	options.	But, for	using	RHEL,	it	is	required	to	take	a	subscription	with	the	company	and pay	for	it.	Otherwise,	you	will	neither	receive	any	updates,	nor	will	you	be able	to	access	to	the	repository. Community	 Enterprise	 Operating	 System:	 CentOS	 is	 the	 community version	of	RHEL.	It	is	the	most	common	distribution	among	the	companies that	have	chosen	to	not	use	the	paid	version	and	want	to	use	the	community version	of	the	RedHat	software. SUSE:	 It	 is	 the	 Novell	  Microsoft 	 distribution	 and	 is	 a	 good	 option, because,	 Microsoft	 is	 one	 of	 the	 biggest	 companies	 around	 the	 world. Therefore,	 the	 probability	 of	 it	 being	 discontinued	 is	 zero,	 and	 you	 will always	have	the	updates	and	new	software	published	by	the	company.	It also	 has	 a	 community	 version	 called	 the	 OpenSUSE	 which	 follows	 the same	features	of	the	CentOS. Debian:	 This	 is	 the	 option	 for	 those	 who	 are	 more	 involved	 in	 the community	and	do	not	want	to	be	bound	to	any	company,	like	the	distros mentioned	previously.	Debian	is	100%	maintained	by	the	community	and is	one	of	the	oldest	distros	we	have.	Also	running	over	a	lot	of	servers,	it	is very	 stable	 and	 reliable,	 and	 is	 frequently	 used	 by	 the	 companies	 and common	users. Ubuntu:	 This	 distro	 was	 made	 in	 Africa	 by	 Canonical	 that	 used	 to distribute	CDs	over	the	whole	world	for	people	to	get	to	know	more	about Linux	 and	 run	 it	 on	 their	 desktops.	 The	 final	 users	 were	 the	 target	 by Canonical	in	the	beginning.	So,	I	believe	that	for	desktops,	Ubuntu	is	the most	used	distro,	and	for	servers,	it	is	CentOS.	Ubuntu	has	a	version	for   server	which	is	my	favorite	distribution.	That's	why	I	am	writing	this	book using	Ubuntu.	But	the	knowledge	you	will	acquire	here	can	be	used	for	all the	distributions.  Servers Servers	are	nothing	more	than	computers.	They	are	usually	more	powerful	than PCs,	which	are	created	and	installed	to	attend	to	a	purpose.	For	example,	we	can install	a	Linux	server	for	acting,	like	web	server.	In	other	words,	to	run	a	website on	it,	like	Facebook,	Amazon,	or	Google.	It	can	also	act	like	a	database	server where	 we	 can	 install	 a	 PostgreSQL,	 SQL	 Server,	 MySQL,	 Oracle,	 or	 another that	 can	 be	 fileserver	 where	 the	 company	 stores	 all	 the	 data	 inside	 it,	 and	 in many	 cases,	 all	 of	 it	 together.	 One	 example	 of	 it	 is	 what	 we	 call	 the	 LAMP, Linux	Apache	MySQL	PHP.	Usually,	we	call	a	server	LAMP	when	we	have	a Linux	system	 a	webserver,	in	that	case ,	Apache,	a	database	server	 MySQL , and	a	programming	language	interpreter,	in	this	case,	PHP.	We	can	also	call	this a	stack.	Stack	means	a	set	of	tools	that	you	can	use	to	solve	a	problem.	One	of my	favorite	stacks	is	NPM,	Nginx,	Python,	and	MongoDB.	I	have	been	using	it to	solve	many	issues	in	the	company	that	I	work.	This	stack	can	be	installed	in	a server,	which	can	be	virtual	or	physical,	and	we	will	do	that	in	the	next	chapters. On-premise	is	a	term	often	used	for	server	installed	within	the	infrastructure	of our	companies,	many-a-times,	in	a	datacenter,	and	sometimes,	under	the	system admin	desk.	The	VMs	can	also	run	in	an	on-premise	infrastructure	when	we	use tools	like	OpenStack	or	oVirt	to	create	them	on	the	top	of	physical	servers.	It	is	a strategy	 adopted	 by	 the	 companies	 towards	 having	 more	 resilience,	 flexibility, and	 better	 use	 of	 our	 resources.	 One	 example	 is	 if	 you	 have	 to	 switch	 one	 or more	servers	in	your	datacenter,	for	the	fact	that	it	is	very	old	and	is	not	able	to have	the	same	performance	as	the	other	servers,	you	can	migrate	the	VMs	from one	 server	 to	 another.	 Switch	 the	 physical	 machine	 and	 after	 installing	 a	 new one,	migrate	all	the	VMs	back. Cloud	is	the	name	used	to	describe	when	the	virtual	servers	are	installed	inside the	 infrastructure	 of	 something	 else.	 In	 most	 cases,	 the	 companies	 like	 AWS, Azure,	and	GCP	have	their	own	on-premise	infrastructure	and	rent	it	for	us.	So, we	do	not	need	to	take	care	of	the	maintenance,	like	switching	disks	when	they fail,	switching	the	server	when	they	are	deprecated,	or	even	the	electricity	and the	 internet.	 Furthermore,	 you	 can	 save	 costs	 by	 turning	 them	 off	 after	 the business	 day	 and	 starting	 them	 again	 the	 next	 day.	 All	 these	 providers	 only charge	you	for	the	time	that	the	machine	is	turned	on.	Otherwise,	you	are	going   to	pay	only	for	the	storage.  Conclusion Now	 that	 we	 already	 have	 a	 brief	 explanation	 regarding	 the	 servers,	 virtual machines,	 Linux,	 and	 distributions,	 we	 are	 ready	 to	 start	 the	 hands-on.	 Let's begin	by	setting	up	our	first	Linux	environment	and	get	to	know	the	basics,	and so	much	more.  Setting	up	your	environment One	of	the	most	important	tasks	for	a	Linux	professional	is	the	skill	to	set	up different	 types	 of	 environment,	 run	 web	 server,	 databases,	 file	 systems,	 and many	different	services	by	different	vendors.	In	this	chapter,	we	will	see	where to	 download	 a	 Linux	 distribution	 from,	 how	 to	 install	 a	 virtualization	 tool	 to create	your	testing	environments,	how	to	create	a	base	image	to	make	it	easier for	 the	 creation	 of	 new	 labs,	 and	 if	 you	 crash	 your	 testing	 environment,	 what happens	very	often	when	we	learn	new	stuff. To	 run	 VMs	 on	 your	 laptop	 or	 personal	 computer,	 you	 need	 to	 check	 if	 your processor	 arch	 is	 64-bit.	 This	 specification	 can	 be	 found	 at	 the	 laptop manufacturer	or	processor	manufacturer.	After	checking	this	setting,	you	need	to enable	virtualization	at	your	device's	BIOS	or	UEFI.	This	configuration	can	be very	different	according	to	your	equipment,	but	in	most	of	the	cases,	it	can	be found	 in	 the	 Advanced	 or	 Security	 option	 with	 the	 name	 Intel	 Virtualization Technology.  Installing	the	VirtualBox Nowadays,	we	have	many	options	for	virtualization	tools	to	run	on	your	laptop, like	VMware	Player,	KVM,	QEMU,	HyperV.	But,	in	my	opinion,	VirtualBox	is the	easiest	one	and	has	all	the	features	we	need	to	create	our	labs. To	 install	 the	 VirtualBox,	 you	 need	 to	 download	 its	 latest	 version	 from	 the official	website: https:  www.virtualbox.org wiki Downloads I	am	using	Windows	system,	so,	I	am	going	to	download	the	Windows	version. But,	 if	 you	 have	 the	 basic	 knowledge	 of	 Linux	 or	 you	 are	 using	 MacOS,	 the steps	are	basically	the	same. After	 downloading	 the	 file,	 double	 click	 and	 the	 installation	 step	 is	 basically   Next,	Next,	and	Finish.	The	following	first	window	is	just	explaining	that	you are	about	to	install	the	VirtualBox:  Figure	1.1  The	second	window	is	important	for	you	to	select	all	the	resources,	because	a	lot of	times,	they	are	needed	mainly	when	you	want	to	share	the	files	between	your PC	and	the	VM,	or	even	configure	networks:   Following	are	the	basic	options	about	the	shortcuts,	if	you	want	to	add	them	to your	desktop:  Figure	1.2   Figure	1.3  At	 this	 step,	 the	 installation	 will	 ask	 you	 for	 the	 Admin	 Rights,	 because	 the VirtualBox	will	create	a	bridge	interface.	This	interface	is	responsible	for	the communication	between	the	host	machine	and	the	VM,	and	without	it,	you	will not	be	able	to	access	the	internet	from	your	virtual	machine:   Figure	1.4   Figure	1.5   After	the	installation	completes,	you	will	be	able	to	open	the	VirtualBox,	and	the main	screen	will	be	as	shown	in	the	following	figure:  Figure	1.6   Figure	1.7  Now,	we	are	ready	to	set	up	our	first	Linux	environment.	The	VirtualBox	has	a lot	of	options	for	you	to	configure	and	explore.	But,	I	will	not	focus	on	it	now because	we	have	a	Linux	system	to	install.  Installing	the	Linux	System Since	I	mentioned	earlier	that	we	will	use	the	Ubuntu	server	to	do	everything	in this	book,	you	can	download	the	latest	version	from	this	link: https:  ubuntu.com download server Then,	download	this	file:	ubuntu-18.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso Now,	let's	start	the	installation.	The	first	step	is	to	open	the	VirtualBox,	click	on New,	 and	 in	 the	 new	 window,	 type	 UbuntuServer,	 as	 given	 in	 the	 following example:   Figure	1.8  After	clicking	on	Next,	you	need	to	define	the	amount	of	memory	you	want	to have	in	your	VM.	The	Linux	system,	usually,	does	not	need	a	lot	of	memory	to work,	 but,	 after	 you	 install	 your	 services	 and	 test	 them,	 you	 will	 need	 more memory.	For	now,	1	GB	is	enough.	Then,	click	on	Next:   Figure	1.9  In	this	part,	create	a	New	Disk.	The	disk	is	basically	a	file	in	your	disk	where	the VM	 will	 store	 all	 the	 data.	 Click	 on	 Create	 and	 you	 will	 see	 the	 following window:   Figure	1.10  VDI	is	the	standard	type	used	by	the	VirtualBox.	You	can	change	the	type	if	you intend	to	import	this	machine	in	other	Virtualization	Tool.	VMDK,	for	example,	is the	type	used	by	VMware.	Click	on	Next:   Figure	1.11  This	 window	 is	 very	 important.	 In	 your	 laboratories,	 you	 will	 always	 use	 the Dynamically	allocated	option,	because	the	VirtualBox	will	create	a	small	file and	will	increase	the	size	according	to	the	disk	usage. The	Fixed	Size	is	recommended	for	the	production	environments,	because	the Virtualization	Tool	will	reserve	that	space	for	your	VM.	Even	if	you	don't	use	all the	disk	space	allocated,	it	will	avoid	you	from	having	more	Virtual	Space	than the	Physical	Space.	In	some	cases,	when	you	use	the	Dynamically	allocated   size	in	production	environments,	you	overcome	the	total	space	of	your	Storage, but	your	virtual	machines	still	have	free	space.	I	had	experienced	this	in	the	past and	 it	 is	 really	 hard	 to	 deal	 with.	 One	 more	 reason	 to	 choose	 this	 option	 is because	 you	 avoid	 your	 Virtualization	 Tool	 to	 recalculate	 the	 disk	 space	 after every	writes.	When	you	use	the	 Dynamically	 allocated	type	for	every	write, your	 system	 will	 calculate	 the	 actual	 size	 and	 how	 much	 it	 needs	 to	 increase before	it	reaches	the	defined	limit:   Here,	you	can	define	where	the	VM	data	will	be	stored	and	the	disk	size.	For	us, 10	GB	is	enough	to	run	our	tests:  Figure	1.12   Now,	your	VM	is	created!  Figure	1.13  Installing	Your	Linux	System Once	 we	 have	 all	 the	 prerequisites,	 like	 creating	 the	 VM	 and	 defining	 all	 the configurations,	it's	time	to	install	the	system.	So,	double	click	on	your	VM.	The following	screen	will	sppear:   You	do	not	have	any	operating	system	installed	in	this	VM.	You	need	to	select the	ISO	download	from	the	Ubuntu	website	by	clicking	on	the	yellow	folder:  Figure	1.14   Click	on	Add,	and	select	the	ISO	file	you	had	already	downloaded.	Select	it,	click on	choose,	and	Start:  Figure	1.15   Figure	1.16  Now,	select	your	language.	I	always	select	English	even	when	I	lived	in	Brazil, Canada,	and	now	in	Germany.	Selecting	this	option,	for	sure,	will	avoid	a	lot	of problems	regarding	collation,	like	punctuation,	special	characters,	etc.:   Figure	1.17  This	option	depends	on	your	keyboard	layout.	You	will	probably	need	to	change it	according	to	the	country	you	are	living	in	the	moment.	My	keyboard	has	the layout	of	the	US,	so	I	will	select	this	option:   Figure	1.18  Now,	you	don't	need	to	do	anything.	Just	press	 Done,	because	we	will	use	the default	 configuration.	 This	 step	 is	 really	 important	 because	 Ubuntu	 will download	 some	 updates	 during	 the	 installation.	 So,	 it	 is	 important	 to	 have	 an internet	connection	in	your	PC	and	in	your	VM:   Figure	1.19  If	you	are	doing	this	during	your	work	time,	and	if	your	company	has	the	proxy to	access	the	internet,	now	is	the	time	for	you	to	configure.	So,	just	put	the	proxy URL	and	press	Done:   Figure	1.20  Here,	you	can	define	the	Mirror	where	Ubuntu	will	download	the	updates.	If	you have	an	internet	connection,	it	will	select	the	nearest	mirror	to	you.	In	my	case,	I have	the	German	repository:   Figure	1.21  Years	 ago,	 I	 would	 have	 given	 you	 a	 big	 explanation	 about	 the	 important directories	 on	 Linux,	 which	 is	 the	 best	 way	 to	 split	 your	 disk	 among	 the directories	 and	 the	 partitions.	 But	 nowadays,	 it	 is	 not	 that	 important	 when	 we work	with	the	virtual	machines.	We	can	consider	the	Amazon	EC2	instances	as an	example.	These	do	not	even	have	the	SWAP	partition.	If	you	lack	space,	just increase	 more	 in	 your	 root	 partition	 and	 clean	 your	 server.	 Another	 important thing	 is	 the	  var	 directory.	 I	 won't	 go	 deep	 into	 that	 topic	 now,	 but	 it	 is	 the directory	 where	 the	 logs	 of	 your	 Linux	 system	 are	 stored.	 Therefore,	 they frequently	use	a	lot	of	your	free	space	and	we	have	to	clean	it	often.	Years	ago,	I would	ask	you	split	it	into	a	different	partition.	But	today,	we	have	tools	to	ship the	logs	to	a	 Log	Server,	and	we	can	just	remove	the	logs	every	day	from	the local	machine.	However,	select	Use	An	Entire	Disk:   Now,	select	the	physical	device	where	the	operating	system	will	be	installed,	and press	Enter:  Figure	1.22   Figure	1.23  The	following	screen	shows	you	how	your	disk	has	been	partitioned.	We	can	see that	there	is	a	 Physical	 Device,	 VBOX_HARDDISK,	and	it	is	split	into	two	parts. The	 boot	 partition,	 which	 is	 mandatory	 to	 boot	 your	 system,	 is	 where	 the bootloader	is	installed. The	root	partition,	also	known	as	 .	Just	select	Done:   Figure	1.24  Here,	we	will	create	the	first	user,	and	then	I	will	define	the	following	data:  Your	name:	alisson	-	this	is	just	your	real	name,	but	it	will	not	be	used	for anything. Your	Server's	name:	devops	-	this	is	the	hostname	of	your	machine Pick	a	username:	alisson	-	this	is	literally	the	user	which	you	will	use	to access	the	server Choose	a	password:	devops Confirm	your	password:	devops  Press	Done. Attention!   The	following	step	is	really	important.	The	OpenSSH	server	is	not	installed	by default,	so	you	have	to	select	the	option,	and	install	the	OpenSSH	server.	You can	use	the	key	Tab	to	change	the	options.	Otherwise,	you	will	not	be	able	to access	your	server	from	a	remote	connection:  Now	that	you	have	selected	the	right	option,	press	Done:  Figure	1.25   Figure	1.26  Now,	 you	 need	 to	 select	 a	 Template	 of	 installation	 for	 your	 server,	 like	 a Nextcloud	 server.	 Or,	 if	 you	 intend	 to	 run	 Kubernetes,	 you	 can	 select	 the microk8s,	 But	 it	 is	 not	 what	 we	 want.	 So,	 press	 Tab	 to	 change	 the	 option	 to Done,	and	press	Enter:   Figure	1.27  Now,	 your	 installation	 has	 begun.	 It	 may	 take	 a	 while	 because	 Ubuntu	 will download	the	updates	and	some	important	packages.	You	are	not	obligated	to	do the	updates.	But,	in	my	view,	it	is	important	for	those	who	are	learning	Linux	to have	an	updated	system.	Just	wait	for	the	installation	to	finish,	and	when	Ubuntu asks	 you	 for	 a	 Reboot,	 do	 that.	 After	 the	 reboot,	 you	 will	 see	 the	 following screen:   Figure	1.28  Enter	the	credentials	defined	during	your	installation: login:	alisson password:	devops Now,	you	are	inside	the	Linux	shell.	Starting	now,	you	will	be	able	to	run	the commands,	install	packages,	and	do	everything	that	you	want	with	your	server. This	 access	 console	 is	 exactly	 what	 you	 would	 do	 if	 you	 were	 inside	 a datacenter.	 Plug	 a	 KVM	  Keyboard	 Video	 Mouse 	 to	 a	 server	 and	 run	 the commands.	 I	 did	 a	 lot	 of	 that	 when	 I	 was	 working	 with	 Colocation.	 This	 is	 a business	 model	 in	 which	 you	 can	 buy	 your	 own	 physical	 servers	 and	 install inside	 the	 datacenter	 of	 someone	 else's.	 Thus,	 you	 will	 use	 the	 datacenter infrastructure,	but	the	server	belongs	to	you. It	is	not	used	much,	unless	you	are	working	within	a	datacenter.	If	you	are	still   logged	in	into	your	machine,	run	the	following	command:  ip	a The	preceding	command	will	show	all	the	network	interfaces	you	have	and	their IP	address,	like	the	following	screenshot:  Figure	1.29 We	just	have	2	IP	addresses	and	2	interfaces: Interface:	lo IP	Address:	127.0.0.1 This	is	the	local	IP	address.	It	is	used	to	make	the	TCP IP	connection	without getting	outside	of	the	machine: Interface:	enp0s3   IP	Address:	10.0.2.15 This	 is	 a	 NAT	 interface.	 We	 need	 this	 interface	 just	 to	 make	 the	 internet connection.	 But,	 we	 cannot	 access	 the	 machine	 from	 outside	 using	 this configuration.	 It	 is	 used	 just	 for	 the	 installation	 purposes.	 We	 could	 have changed	 that	 before.	 However,	 I	 wanted	 to	 show	 you	 how	 to	 change	 that configuration	and	why	we	need	to	do	it. To	 change	 this	 configuration,	 go	 to	 the	 main	 screen	 of	 the	 VirtualBox.	 Now, click	on	the	virtual	machine,	and	then,	click	on	Settings		Network.	In	this	part, Attached,	you	will	see	the	value	Nat.	Change	it	to	the	Bridge	Network,	and	in the	option	Name:	select	the	network	interface	that	you	have	the	internet	access	to. In	my	case,	it	is	configured	like	the	following	screenshot:  Figure	1.30  After	 saving	 the	 configuration,	 go	 back	 to	 your	 VM	 and	 run	 the	 following command	again: ip	a You	will	see	a	new	IP	address.	In	my	case,192.168.178.62	was	attached:   Figure	1.31  Accessing	via	SSH We	 have	 a	 connection	 from	 the	 outside	 now.	 So,	 how	 can	 we	 connect	 to	 that machine	using	the	SSH?	In	the	past,	it	was	common	to	use	tools	like	Putty	to SSH	the	servers	from	Windows	machines,	but	in	the	new	versions	of	Windows, we	have	PowerShell,	which	is	installed	by	default	and	we	can	use	it	to	access	our VM. Open	the	PowerShell	if	you're	using	Windows	or	Terminal	in	Linux MacOS,	and run	the	following	command:  ssh	alisson@192.168.178.62 The	 command	 follows	 the	 structure	 USER@HOSTNAME.	 If	 you	 do	 not	 have	 a hostname	configured,	you	can	use	the	IP	address.	After	that,	press	Enter.	It	will show	you	the	following	message: The	authenticity	of	host	'192.168.178.62	 192.168.178.62 '	can't	be established. ECDSA	key	fingerprint	is SHA256:GX474 IAL VeIoiV r6WoPZHRg3HfFTS3tfvigA9jKM. Are	you	sure	you	want	to	continue	connecting	 yes no ?	yes Warning:	Permanently	added	'192.168.178.62'	 ECDSA 	to	the	list	of known	hosts. It	happens	because	this	is	the	first	time	you	are	connecting	to	that	server.	You can	just	type	Yes	to	make	sure	that	you	want	to	connect	to	it	and	then,	the	SSH will	ask	for	your	password:  alisson@192.168.178.62's	password: Type	the	password	defined	in	your	installation.

It	 is	 important	 to	 know	 if	 you want	to	become	a	Linux	expert,	but	not	that	important	for	us	now. We	 know	 that	 using	 a	 password	 to	 access	 the	 server	 is	 not	 the	 best	 practice, because	they	are	a	lot	reliable	and	are	easily	exposed.	So,	we	can	create	a	key pair	to	secure	our	access.

Now	we	are	ready	to	learn	more	about	the	Bash,	directories, files,	and	many	more.  Conclusion This	was	just	the	first	chapter	with	the	basics	on	how	to	install	your	own	Linux server,	and	create	your	labs	on	the	top	of	the	VirtualBox.	I	strongly	recommend you	 to	 do	 all	 these	 steps	 again	 using	 other	 Linux	 distributions	 and	 discover which	one	is	your	favorite.	When	I	started	using	Linux,	I	created	my	own	labs using	different	distributions,	including	Slackware,	Gentoo,	BigLinux,	Mandrake, Mandriva.	So,	feel	free	to	choose	your	own.	In	the	companies	I	worked	for	all these	years,	most	of	them	used	RedHat	or	CentOS,	and	they	had	theirs	on	on- premises	 infrastructure.	 But,	 since	 I	 started	 to	 work	 with	 Cloud,	 it	 has	 been changing.	If	you	try	to	create	Ubuntu	server	machine	on	Amazon,	you	will	see that	it	is	one	of	the	most	used	distributions.   CHAPTER	2 Working	with	Bash  T  his	chapter	will	explain	the	basics	for	you	to	navigate	inside	your	Linux system,	 the	 main	 directories,	 mostly	 used	 commands,	 important	 files,  managing	users	and	groups,	and	how	the	Linux	permission	system	works!  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  What	is	Bash?  Introduction Basic	commands  Managing	files	and	directories  Structure	of	directories Important	files Customizing	your	environment  Managing	users	and	groups  Creating	and	modifying	users Creating	and	modifying	groups  Working	with	permissions  Changing	read	and	write	permissions Changing	the	owner	of	files	and	executing	scripts  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Understand	directories	infrastructure   Customize	your	environment	using	important	files Manage	users	and	groups Understand	the	permissions	and	executing	scripts  What	is	Bash? Bash	is	an	abbreviation	of	Bourne	Again	Shell.	It	is	an	improved	version	of	the Legacy	Shell	that	we	used	to	see	in	older	Linux Unix	Systems.	In	this	version, we	 have	 many	 features,	 like	 creating	 functions,	 controlling	 jobs	 in	 the foreground	 and	 background,	 creating	 aliases,	 customizing	 your	 environment, putting	 color	 in	 your	 terminal,	 new	 shortcuts,	 auto-complete,	 and	 many	 other features	that	we	are	going	to	see	in	this	chapter.	Just	to	give	you	more	context about	it,	Shell	is	the	interface	on	Linux	which	is	used	to	administer	the	system. In	other	words,	it	is	where	we	run	all	the	commands. It	is	also	a	programming	language.	Often	among	Linux	users,	we	see	the	term Shell	Scripting.	What	does	it	mean?	It	means	we	can	get	all	the	commands	used during	 our	 work,	 put	 all	 of	 them	 together	 in	 the	 same	 file,	 give	 permission	 to execute	 it,	 and	 automate	 your	 daily	 job.	 It	 is	 a	 Shell	 Script.	 It	 is	 basically	 the Swiss	Knife	of	the	Linux	administrators.	Today,	it	is	frequently	challenged	by Python,	because	Python	is	an	object-oriented	language	and	has	a	lot	of	features which	are	very	easy	to	use	if	we	compare	it	with	the	Shell	Script.	Nevertheless, it	 will	 always	 be	 the	 favorite	 tool	 of	 all	 the	 Linux	 administrators	 to	 automate easy	tasks,	and	at	the	end	of	this	chapter,	I	will	teach	how	to	create	a	script	using all	the	commands	learned	before.  Introduction In	the	last	chapter,	we	configured	and	installed	our	Linux	system	and	we	were able	to	access	it	using	the	SSH	tool.	The	point	where	we	stopped	is	as	follows: ssh	alisson@192.168.178.62 Welcome	to	Ubuntu	18.04.3	LTS	 GNU Linux	4.15.0-76-generic	x86_64   *	Documentation:			https:  help.ubuntu.com *	Management:						https:  landscape.canonical.com *	Support:									https:  ubuntu.com advantage  System	information	disabled	due	to	load	higher	than	1.0  *	Multipass	1.0	is	out!

Last	login:	Mon	Feb	10	18:59:46	2020 To	run	a	command	as	administrator	 user	"root" ,	use	"sudo  ". See	"man	sudo_root"	for	details.  alisson@devops:~$ It	 means	 we	 are	 inside	 the	 Linux	 Shell.	 Now,	 we	 are	 going	 to	 call	 it	 Bash because	it	is	the	command-line	interpreter	used.	Every	operating	system	has	its own	command-line	interpreter,	because	it	is	required	to	administer	the	system.	In the	older	versions	of	Windows,	we	had	MS-DOS.	Now,	we	have	the	PowerShell. In	the	older	versions	of	Linux,	we	had	the	Shell.	Now,	we	have	the	Bash	and some	 users	 are	 migrating	 from	 Bash	 to	 Z	 shell.	 I	 will	 show	 in	 the	 following pages	how	we	can	change	our	CLI	 Command	Line	Interpreter . Within	your	server,	the	most	useful	command	is	called	ls: alisson@devops:~$	ls id_rsa.pub This	command	is	used	to	show	the	files	and	the	directories	of	Linux.	It	can	be used	 with	 different	 parameters.	 For	 example,	 if	 I	 want	 to	 show	 the	 files	 and directories	in	a	detailed	mode,	I	can	pass	the	parameter	–l: alisson@devops:~$	ls	-l total	4 -rw-rw-r--	1	alisson	alisson	398	Jan	31	20:18	id_rsa.pub alisson@devops:~$ The	last	output	shows	us	more	information	following	that	sequence: Permissions	–	Number	of	the	Hard	Links	–	User	–	Group	–	Size	–	Last Modification	Date	–	Filename This	kind	of	information	is	called	the	metadata.	But	why	does	it	have	this	name? Because,	 we	 have	 a	 file	 which	 contains	 the	 data	 that	 we	 use,	 and	 this	 data	 is about	the	file	that	is	used	the	most	by	the	OS.	For	example,	we	need	not	always know	 the	 size	 of	 a	 file,	 but	 the	 operating	 system	 always	 needs	 that	 kind	 of information,	because	it	needs	to	calculate	the	free	and	used	space	on	the	disk. If	you	want	to	see	more	about	the	metadata	of	a	file,	use	the	following	command   stat: alisson@devops:~$	stat	id_rsa.pub File:	id_rsa.pub Size:	398				Blocks:	8				IO	Block:	4096				regular	file Device:	802h 2050d				Inode:	532800				Links:	1 Access:	 0664 -rw-rw-r-- 	Uid:	 1000 	alisson 	Gid:	 1000 	alisson  Access:	2020-01-31	20:20:23.741638861	+0000 Modify:	2020-01-31	20:18:39.467733742	+0000 Change:	2020-01-31	20:18:39.467733742	+0000 Birth:	- This	command	will	show	you	all	the	metadata	about	the	file	and	in	a	detailed form. One	very	interesting	parameter	of	the	ls	is	the	-a,	which	will	show	you	all	the files	including	the	hidden	ones.	In	Linux,	all	the	hidden	files	starts	with	a	.	 dot  in	the	beginning.	For	example: alisson@devops:~$	ls	-la total	40 drwxr-xr-x	5	alisson	alisson	4096	Jan	31	20:20	. drwxr-xr-x	3	root	root	4096	Jan	31	19:40	.. -rw-------	1	alisson	alisson	113	Jan	31	20:20	.bash_history -rw-r--r--	1	alisson	alisson	220	Apr	4	2018	.bash_logout -rw-r--r--	1	alisson	alisson	3771	Apr	4	2018	.bashrc drwx------	2	alisson	alisson	4096	Jan	31	19:41	.cache drwx------	3	alisson	alisson	4096	Jan	31	19:41	.gnupg -rw-rw-r--	1	alisson	alisson	398	Jan	31	20:18	id_rsa.pub -rw-r--r--	1	alisson	alisson	807	Apr	4	2018	.profile drwxrwxr-x	2	alisson	alisson	4096	Jan	31	20:20	.ssh We	can	see	a	lot	of	files	now,	like	the	.bashrc	or	.bash_history	or	the	hidden directory	 .ssh,	 which	 we	 used	 in	 the	 first	 chapter	 to	 save	 our	 public	 key	 to access	the	server	without	any	password. If	you	want	to	see	the	content	of	a	file,	you	can	use	the	command	cat: alisson@devops:~$	cat	.bash_logout 	~ .bash_logout:	executed	by	bash 1 	when	login	shell	exits.  	when	leaving	the	console	clear	the	screen	to	increase	privacy  if	["$SHLVL"	=	1];	then [-x	 usr bin clear_console]	&&	 usr bin clear_console	-q fi Using	the	command	 cat,	we	were	able	to	see	the	content	of	the	 .bash_logout   file.	This	file	has	some	importance,	because	if	we	want	to	execute	a	command before	logging	out	of	the	server,	we	should	put	in	this	file. To	display	a	message	on	the	screen,	use	the	command	echo: alisson@devops:~$	echo	Message	on	Terminal Message	on	Terminal This	command	is	often	used	to	create	a	file	as	well: alisson@devops:~$	echo	Creating	a	file	>	message.txt alisson@devops:~$	ls id_rsa.pub	message.txt alisson@devops:~$	cat	message.txt Creating	a	file  We	can	use	redirectors	at	Shell	Script	to	send	command	outputs	to	write the	files.	There	exist	many	redirectors,	but	the	most	used	are	">"	and ">>". If	you	use	">"	after	a	command,	the	standard	output	of	the	command	is redirected	to	a	file	that	you	need	to	specify.	But,	if	you	select	an	existing file,	the	redirector	will	overwrite	it. If	you	use	">>"	after	a	command,	the	standard	output	of	the	command is	redirected	to	a	file	that	you	need	to	specify	too.	But,	if	you	select	an existing	file,	the	redirector	will	append	it	and	not	overwrite	it.  To	 manage	 files,	 most	 commands	 use	 the	 same	 syntax.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 copy, move,	 or	 rename	 a	 file,	 you	 can	 use	 COMMAND	  <DESTINATION FILE>.  Renaming	a	file: alisson@devops:~$	mv	message.txt	file.txt alisson@devops:~$	ls file.txt	id_rsa.pub Copying	a	file: alisson@devops:~$	cp	file.txt	file2.txt alisson@devops:~$	ls file2.txt	file.txt	id_rsa.pub In	the	first	chapter,	we	edited	a	file	and	called	authorized_keys.	If	we	want	to check	this	file	again,	we	can	access	the	directory	using	the	command	cd: alisson@devops:~$	cd	.ssh    alisson@devops:~ .ssh$	ls authorized_keys And,	we	can	check	the	file	content	again: alisson@devops:~ .ssh$	cat	authorized_keys ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQChi8HX26xv9Rk9gz47Qhb+Tu7MRqGIyP xnheIeEgFad dlqG4w4pY7y5dtx5LNGE9C01varco5dZagqsHplI7M+5ECSvjAuS6b5r kYZwZiZruDXxckcQHFpr2yIz	3DOzKRTUc5Hg5JHF5aymiqyVfTsxL aI LDY8Ikh+ INn3S9+b5bZtU+74tA6yuqt h5SCtNSWwMUlv7QL6ONHtQiviAjBe+ksDBBV6thWz2ZIJA jApSIBJWK9AWmZwq 2hFy9sOZArUDB2Kt6kl3rIZnHpqJ GMUCxFhtggYamJ5J2H62 77qLFqLZ 8tum9uc5l lSWYKTDm2+E prQfmFrxPf9	1511	mxti@avell If	 you	 need	 to	 know	 the	 directory	 you	 are	 working	 on,	 use	 the	 following command: alisson@devops:~ .ssh$	pwd  home alisson .ssh And	if	you	want	to	go	to	the	previous	directory	again,	use	the	command	cd	using two	dots	 .. : alisson@devops:~ .ssh$	cd	.. alisson@devops:~$	pwd  home alisson  Managing	files	and	directories After	 getting	 to	 know	 some	 basic	 commands,	 it	 is	 really	 important	 for	 you	 to know	 how	 to	 navigate	 among	 the	 directories,	 know	 the	 files	 within	 them,	 and what	we	can	do	using	these	files.	So,	now	we	will	see	what	the	root	directory	is, where	the	configuration	files	are,	what	these	files	do	for	our	Linux	system,	and how	we	can	customize	the	environment	using	it.  Structure	of	directories To	 see	 the	 basic	 structure	 of	 the	 directories	 on	 Linux,	 use	 the	 following command: alisson@devops:~$	ls	  bin	cdrom	etc	initrd.img	lib	lost+found	mnt	proc	run	snap	swap.img tmp	var	vmlinuz.old boot	dev	home	initrd.img.old	lib64	media	opt	root	sbin	srv	sys	usr vmlinuz   Here,	we	have	some	directories.	I	will	explain	just	the	most	important	of	them:   :	It	is	the	root	directory	and	everything	that	runs	in	your	Linux	system	is below	this	directory.  etc:	This	directory	stores	all	the	configuration	files	on	Linux.  var:	 This	 directory	 stores	 the	 log	 files	 and	 data	 of	 some	 services.	 For example,	if	you	have	a	MySQL	server	installed	in	your	system,	you	can find	all	the	data	stored	inside	 var lib mysql data.  lib:	Here	you	will	find	the	libraries	of	your	system.	We	do	not	have	to often	access	this	directory,	but	it	is	an	important	one	to	know.	For	example, the	kernel	modules	are	stored	in	 lib modules.  bin:	This	directory	stores	the	binaries.	In	other	words,	the	programs	are required	for	your	Linux	Words.	For	example,	the	command	ls,	it	is	found in	this	directory.  usr:	 Here	 you	 can	 find	 some	 binaries,	 like	 the	  bin.	 But	 the	 binaries installed	 here	 are	 not	 required	 for	 your	 system	 works.	 For	 example,  usr bin at,	 this	 binary	 allows	 you	 to	 schedule	 a	 task	 to	 run	 in	 your system,	but	you	can	live	without	that.  boot:	 In	 this	 directory,	 you	 can	 find	 your	 kernel	 installed.	 My	 current version	is:	 boot vmlinuz-4.15.0-76-generic.  proc:	This	is	the	current	process	running.	One	fact	about	this	directory	is it	only	exists	when	your	Linux	is	turned	on.	If	you	have	a	dual	boot	and you	 try	 to	 mount	 your	 Linux	 partition,	 you	 will	 be	 able	 to	 see	 all	 the directories,	except	the	 proc,	because	it	is	your	RAM	content.  opt:	 Usually,	 it	 becomes	 empty	 after	 your	 installation.	 But,	 when	 you compile	 a	 program,	 it	 is	 a	 good	 practice	 to	 put	 the	 binaries	 and	 the configuration	files	in	this	directory.  sbin:	 This	 is	 exactly	 like	 the	  bin,	 but	 the	 binaries	 here	 require administration	permissions.	For	example,	if	you	want	to	format	a	partition, you	will	call	the	command	 sbin fdisk.	You	cannot	run	this	command	as a	common	user.  home:	 In	 this	 directory,	 you	 will	 find	 the	 home	 directory	 of	 all	 the common	users.	The	only	exception	is	the	user	root;	its	home	directory	can be	found	in	 root.  mnt:	Here,	you	can	use	to	mount	network	shares;	your	pendrive,	SD	card, and	another	kind	of	external	volumes.   These	are	the	most	important	directories	you	can	find	in	your	Linux	system	and they	will	be	a	part	of	your	daily	work.  Important	Files Now	that	you	already	know	the	important	directories,	let's	get	inside	of	them	and see	the	files	that	are	important	for	our	system	to	work. One	important	file	is	the	  etc passwd.	This	file	is	responsible	to	store	all	the Linux	users,	and	we	can	give	a	look	at	its	content	using	the	cat	command: alisson@devops:~$	cat	 etc passwd root:x:0:0:root: root: bin bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon: usr sbin: usr sbin nologin bin:x:2:2:bin: bin: usr sbin nologin sys:x:3:3:sys: dev: usr sbin nologin sync:x:4:65534:sync: bin: bin sync This	 was	 an	 example	 of	 the	 first	 5	 lines.	 Its	 structure	 follows	 the	 following sequence: User	–	password	–	user	id	–	group	id	–	comment	–	home	folder	- shell The	data	is	separated	by	a	colon	 : .	It	is	important	to	know	that	the	Linux	shell has	many	useful	commands	to	work	with	these	kinds	of	files. For	example,	we	could	use	the	command	cut	to	see	just	the	information	we	want: alisson@devops:~$	cut	-f	1,6,7	-d	:	 etc passwd root: root: bin bash daemon: usr sbin: usr sbin nologin bin: bin: usr sbin nologin sys: dev: usr sbin nologin Thus,	in	the	example,	I	printed	just	the	columns	1,	6,	7	which	correspond	to	the user,	the	home	folder,	and	the	shell. I	am	not	posting	the	entire	output	of	the	command	because	I	want	to	save	some space.	But,	you	probably	are	running	this	on	your	own	virtual	machine.	So,	if you	 want	 to	 show	 just	 the	 first	 3	 lines	 of	 any	 file,	 you	 can	 use	 the	 command head.	By	default,	this	command	shows	the	first	10	lines	of	a	file,	but	we	have	the -n	parameter,	where	we	can	define	as	many	lines	we	want	to	see. For	example: alisson@devops:~$	head	-n	3	 etc passwd root:x:0:0:root: root: bin bash   daemon:x:1:1:daemon: usr sbin: usr sbin nologin bin:x:2:2:bin: bin: usr sbin nologin On	Linux,	it	is	also	possible	to	concatenate	the	commands.	If	you	want	to	see just	 the	 first	 3	 lines	 and	 only	 the	 columns	 1,	 6,	 7	 like	 we	 did	 with	 the	 cut command,	we	can	use	the	pipe	  .	This	statement	has	the	function	of	getting	the output	of	the	last	command	and	sending	it	to	the	next	command	in	the	pipeline. Example: alisson@devops:~$	head	-n3	 etc passwd		cut	-f	1,6,7	-d	: root: root: bin bash daemon: usr sbin: usr sbin nologin bin: bin: usr sbin nologin Therefore,	every	time	that	you	want	to	concatenate	the	commands,	you	must	use the	pipe	  .	One	interesting	point	is	the	second	columns	of	the	 etc passwd	file. I	wrote	that	it	is	the	password,	but	we	can	only	see	an	x,	this	character	represents the	encrypted	password.	The	hash	can	be	found	in	the	file	 etc shadow: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	head	-n3	 etc shadow [sudo]	password	for	alisson: root:*:18113:0:99999:7::: daemon:*:18113:0:99999:7::: bin:*:18113:0:99999:7::: To	 see	 the	 content	 of	 this	 file,	 you	 need	 to	 run	 the	 command	 sudo	 before	 the command	head.	The	 sudo	command	means	the	substitute	users	do.	In	a	simple way,	we	are	running	the	command	head	as	we	were	another	user.	If	you	do	not specify	the	user,	by	default,	the	user	is	root.	The	password	is	the	same	as	we	set in	the	installation.	If	you	set	the	same	password	as	me,	it’s	devops. To	see	your	user's	password,	we	can	use	the	command	grep.	This	command	will find	the	line	which	corresponds	with	our	criteria	of	the	search. Example: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	grep	alisson	 etc shadow alisson:$6$aeR.OxEqoVMnyUuq$eYxtbG6V.156mtlsK9QBZcVOjQZBm7NlcKFn5x1y xF4mffuLYd6Wmz2R9V2iKZvuC7fgp96H7.jlQW o7OenF :18292:0:99999:7::: Now	you	can	clearly	see	the	password	hash	in	the	second	column.	Of	course,	we cannot	decrypt	it,	but	if	you	want	to	take	a	Linux	certification,	you	will	need	to record	 this	 file	 and	 the	 structures.	 However,	 we	 can	 also	 remove	 a	 user's password.	You	can	just	edit	this	file	and	delete	the	hash.	This	way,	the	user	will not	have	a	password	and	he	can	set	a	new	one	in	the	future.   Regarding	the	users,	we	also	have	one	file	on	Linux	to	manage	the	groups.	This file	is	located	in	 etc group: alisson@devops:~$	head	-n	3	 etc group root:x:0: daemon:x:1: bin:x:2: This	file	follows	the	following	sequence: Group	name		password		group	id		users So,	the	users	added	into	a	group	will	appear	in	the	last	column	of	each	line.	As	I explained	earlier,	we	can	use	the	command	grep	to	find	a	group	and	see	which users	were	added	into	it: alisson@devops:~$	grep	sudo	 etc group sudo:x:27:alisson It	shows	us	one	interesting	thing;	the	command	sudo	only	allows	the	users	who belong	 to	 the	 sudo	 group	 to	 use	 the	 command.	 Another	 important	 file	 is	 the  etc fstab.	This	file	is	responsible	to	mount	our	volumes	during	the	boot.	Let's give	it	a	look: alisson@devops:~$	cat	 etc fstab UUID=75fbe5e6-26ff-4522-abc4-0d8a3ac69c5b	 	ext4	defaults	0	0  swap.img	none	swap	sw	0	0 When	you	work	with	Linux,	it	is	really	important	for	you	to	know	the	structure of	the	files.	So,	this	file	is	organized	in	the	following	sequence: Partition	–	folder	–	filesystem	type	–	mounting	options	–	backup enable	–	disk	check	sequence Nowadays,	 this	 command	 lets	 you	 see	 the	 first	 column	 with	 a	 uuid,	 which represents	 a	 partition.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 see	 where	 it	 binds,	 run	 the	 following command: alisson@devops:~$	blkid  dev sda2:	UUID="75fbe5e6-26ff-4522-abc4-0d8a3ac69c5b"	TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="7177f53d-2db2-49cb-93a9-21d763cac088" If	you	check,	it	is	exactly	the	same	in	the	  etc fstab.	If	you	want	to	change, you	can	just	replace	the	uuid	in	the	file	to	 dev sda2.	It	will	work	in	the	same way.	The	machine's	hostname	is	stored	in	the	 etc hostname: alisson@devops:~$	cat	 etc hostname   devops If	you	want	to	change	the	hostname,	you	can	just	edit	this	file.	We	also	have	the  etc hosts	 file	 that	 you	 can	 map	 an	 IP	 address	 to	 a	 name,	 as	 we	 did	 in	 the DNS: alisson@devops:~$	cat	 etc hosts 127.0.0.1	localhost 127.0.1.1	devops  	The	following	lines	are	desirable	for	IPv6	capable	hosts ::1					ip6-localhost	ip6-loopback fe00::0	ip6-localnet ff00::0	ip6-mcastprefix ff02::1	ip6-allnodes ff02::2	ip6-allrouters It	is	very	useful	when	you	are	developing	a	web	system	and	you	don't	want	to type	 the	 IP	 address	 in	 the	 browser	 every	 time	 a	 really	 important	 file	 is  etc sudores: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	cat	 etc sudoers [sudo]	password	for	alisson:  	This	file	MUST	be	edited	with	the	'visudo'	command	as	root.

I	explained earlier,	the	only	users	in	the	group	sudo	can	run	the	command.	But,	how	does	the command	know	which	group	it	needs	to	use?	Because	of	the	following	line: 	Allow	members	of	group	sudo	to	execute	any	command %sudo			ALL= ALL:ALL 	ALL You	can	put	more	groups	in	this	file	or	you	can	put	the	users	directly,	like	the following	line: 	User	privilege	specification root			ALL= ALL:ALL 	ALL One	thing	that	is	nice	to	work	with	Linux	is	since	all	the	documentation	comes inside	the	files,	like	we	saw	in	the	 etc sudoers,	the	comments	explain	how	and where	you	have	to	edit	the	file.

It	 follows	 the	 following structure: Minute	–	hour	–	day	of	the	month	–	month	–	day	of	the	week	–	user	- command So,	if	you	want	to	schedule	the	tasks	to	run	every	Friday	at	07	pm,	you	can	add	a line	like	the	following: 00	19			*	*	5			root			bash	 bin backup.sh Therefore,	 every	 Friday	 at	 7	 pm,	 the	 user	 root	 will	 run	 the	 command backup.sh.	This	is	how	we	must	read	a	line	in	the	crontab	file.	This	is	the	main file,	 but	 each	 user	 has	 their	 own	 crontabs,	 and	 they	 can	 be	 found	 in	 the following	path: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	ls	 var spool cron crontabs 	-la [sudo]	password	for	alisson: total	8 drwx-wx--T	2	root	crontab	4096	Nov	16	2017	. drwxr-xr-x	5	root	root				4096	Aug	5		2019	.. We	 do	 not	 have	 any	 file	 inside	 this	 directory,	 because	 we	 never	 created	 any schedule.	But,	we	can	edit	the	users'	crontab	for	you	to	see	the	creation	of	the file.	Type	the	following	command	in	your	terminal: alisson@devops:~$	crontab	-e no	crontab	for	alisson	-	using	an	empty	one  Select	an	editor.	To	change	later,	run	'select-editor'.   1.	 bin nano	<----	easiest 2.	 usr bin vim.basic 3.	 usr bin vim.tiny 4.	 bin ed  Choose	1-4	[1]:	2 crontab:	installing	new	crontab You	can	choose	option	2,	as	I	did.	It	will	set	the	VIM	as	the	default	text	editor for	your	crontab.	Wait	for	the	VIM	to	open	and	close	by	pressing	Esc,	and	use the	following	command:  :wq! I	 will	 explain	 more	 about	 VIM	 in	 the	 next	 section.	 Now	 that	 you	 have	 saved your	user	crontab,	you	can	check	the	folder	again: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	ls	 var spool cron crontabs 	-la total	12 drwx-wx--T	2	root	crontab	4096	Feb	17	20:54	. drwxr-xr-x	5	root	root	4096	Aug	5	2019	.. -rw-------	1	alisson	crontab	1089	Feb	17	20:54	alisson You	can	see	that	a	file	with	the	same	user's	name	was	created.	So,	every	user will	have	a	file	in	this	folder	since	they	created	a	 crontab	using	the	command crontab	-e.	For	Linux	systems,	it	is	a	requirement	to	have	an	SSH	connection and	the	configuration	file	for	this	is:	 etc ssh sshd_config: alisson@devops:~$	cat	 etc ssh sshd_config 	$OpenBSD:	sshd_config,v	1.101	2017 03 14	07:19:07	djm	Exp	$  	This	is	the	sshd	server	system-wide	configuration	file.	See 	sshd_config 5 	for	more	information.  	This	sshd	was	compiled	with	PATH= usr bin: bin: usr sbin: sbin  	The	strategy	used	for	options	in	the	default	sshd_config	shipped with 	OpenSSH	is	to	specify	options	with	their	default	value	where 	possible,	but	leave	them	commented.	Uncommented	options	override the 	default	value.  Port	22 AddressFamily	any ListenAddress	0.0.0.0 ListenAddress	:: Formerly,	we	have	a	short	part	of	the	file,	in	which	you	are	able	to	change	the   port,	and	define	which	IP	addresses	will	listen	for	the	connections: alisson@devops:~$	grep	Root	 etc ssh sshd_config PermitRootLogin	prohibit-password 	the	setting	of	"PermitRootLogin	without-password". One	important	configuration	in	the	preceding	file,	PermitRootLogin,	is	in	some cases,	we	are	able	to	login	in	the	server	using	the	root	user	directly.	But,	it	is	not a	 good	 practice.	 However,	 it	 is	 not	 uncommon	 to	 see	 in	 an	 on-premises environment.	In	the	cloud	environment,	it	is	never	allowed,	because	everyone	in the	world	can	try	to	access	with	the	root	user. Another	important	configuration	is	the	following	one: alisson@devops:~$	grep	PasswordAuthentication	 etc ssh sshd_config PasswordAuthentication	yes 	PasswordAuthentication.	Depending	on	your	PAM	configuration, 	PAM	authentication,	then	enable	this	but	set PasswordAuthentication PasswordAuthentication	yes If	you	are	working	with	any	Cloud	provider	like	Amazon,	Azure,	or	GCP,	this configuration	 is	 disabled	 by	 default,	 for	 security	 reasons.	 We	 have	 added	 our SSH	key	in	the	server	in	the	first	chapter.	So,	if	you	want,	you	can	edit	this	file and	change	the	option	for	no.  Managing	users	and	groups Now,	you	already	know	some	of	the	important	files,	and	the	files	responsible	to manage	users	and	groups.	We	could	just	open	these	files	and	edit	them	to	create new	users	and	groups.	But,	Linux	has	useful	commands	which	should	be	used	to do	that	job	and	make	our	life	easier.  Managing	users To	see	the	users,	we	have	the	command	getent: alisson@devops:~$	getent	passwd root:x:0:0:root: root: bin bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon: usr sbin: usr sbin nologin bin:x:2:2:bin: bin: usr sbin nologin sys:x:3:3:sys: dev: usr sbin nologin The	output	is	a	quite	similar	as	the	command	cat,	but,	the	difference	is	that	we can	look	for	a	specific	user,	like	we	did	using	the	command	grep:   alisson@devops:~$	getent	passwd	alisson alisson:x:1000:1000:alisson: home alisson: bin bash Thus,	it	is	up	to	you	which	command	you	want	to	use.	When	I	am	working,	I always	use	the	 getent,	to	look	for	a	user	or	group,	and	the	 grep	command,	to find	a	line	in	any	file	of	the	Linux	system. To	add	a	new	user,	run	the	following	command: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	adduser	elvis [sudo]	password	for	alisson: Adding	user	'elvis'	… Adding	new	group	'elvis'	 1001 	… Adding	new	user	'elvis'	 1001 	with	group	'elvis'	… Creating	home	directory	' home elvis'	… Copying	files	from	' etc skel'	… Enter	new	UNIX	password: Retype	new	UNIX	password: passwd:	password	updated	successfully Changing	the	user	information	for	elvis Enter	the	new	value,	or	press	ENTER	for	the	default  Full	Name	[]: Room	Number	[]: Work	Phone	[]: Home	Phone	[]: Other	[]:  Is	the	information	correct?	[Y n] Only	the	username	and	password	are	mandatory.	You	can	leave	the	other	options blank,	as	I	did	in	the	example.	I	set	the	password	as	devops.	If	you	analyze	the command	 output,	 you	 can	 see	 two	 things	 that	 are	 important	 for	 us	 to	 pay attention. The	 first	 is	 the	 information	 about	 the	 home	 directory.	 The	 command	 creates	 a folder	 called	 elvis	 within	 the	  home	 folder.	 As	 I	 explained	 earlier,	 the	 home folder	is	responsible	for	the	user's	files. The	second	is	the	 etc skel,	where	the	command	adduser	gets	the	default	files present	in	the	home	folder	of	the	user.	We	can	give	it	a	look	with	the	following command: alisson@devops:~$	ls	 etc skel 	-la total	20 drwxr-xr-x	2	root	root	4096	Aug	5	2019	. drwxr-xr-x	91	root	root	4096	Feb	18	19:25	.. -rw-r--r--	1	root	root	220	Apr	4	2018	.bash_logout -rw-r--r--	1	root	root	3771	Apr	4	2018	.bashrc   -rw-r--r--	1	root	root	807	Apr	4	2018	.profile These	files	are	responsible	to	customize	the	user's	environment.	We	are	going	to edit	 them	 in	 the	 last	 part	 of	 this	 chapter.	 But,	 if	 you	 want	 to	 put	 more	 items inside	the	home	folder,	you	can	just	add	inside	the	 etc skel,	and	they	will	be present	for	the	next	user	created.	Let's	test	it. Let's	 create	 a	 skeleton	 for	 a	 hosting	 server.	 How	 does	 the	 web	 server	 work? Usually,	we	have	the	user	and	in	the	 home	folder	of	each	user,	you	have	some folder	called,	public_html,	mail,	conf,	logs.	All	these	folders	must	be	created at	the	same	time	as	the	user	is	created.	So,	run	the	following	command: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	mkdir	 etc skel {public_html,	logs,	mail, conf} [sudo]	password	for	alisson: alisson@devops:~$	ls	 etc skel  conf	logs	mail	public_html alisson@devops:~$ So,	 as	 you	 can	 see,	 now	 we	 have	 these	 four	 folders	 created	 inside	 the  etc skel.	Now,	let's	create	another	user	to	see	it	working: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	adduser	customer01 Adding	user	'customer01'	… Adding	new	group	'customer01'	 1002 	… Adding	new	user	'customer01'	 1002 	with	group	'customer01'	… Creating	home	directory	' home customer01'	… Copying	files	from	' etc skel'	… Enter	new	UNIX	password: Retype	new	UNIX	password: passwd:	password	updated	successfully Changing	the	user	information	for	customer01 Enter	the	new	value,	or	press	ENTER	for	the	default  Full	Name	[]: Room	Number	[]: Work	Phone	[]: Home	Phone	[]: Other	[]:  Is	the	information	correct?	[Y n] alisson@devops:~$	ls	 home customer01  conf	logs	mail	public_html As	you	can	see	now,	we	have	these	folders	created	in	the	home	folder	of	the	user. I	am	setting	the	same	password	for	all	users.	But,	if	you	forgot	a	password	and you	want	to	change	it,	the	command	to	do	that	is	as	follows: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	passwd	elvis   Enter	new	UNIX	password: Retype	new	UNIX	password: passwd:	password	updated	successfully Now,	type	the	new	password	and	it	is	changed. We	 are	 now	 talking	 about	 the	 hosting	 servers.	 So,	 let's	 use	 another	 example. Imagine	 your	 customer	 did	 not	 pay	 you.	 So,	 you	 need	 to	 block	 this	 user.	 To execute	this	task,	you	can	run	the	following	command: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	passwd	-l	customer01 passwd:	password	expiry	information	changed. One	interesting	thing	about	Linux	is	if	you	want	to	know	how	it	blocks	the	users, you	can	give	a	look	at	the	 etc shadow: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	shadow	customer01 customer01:!$6$PExBAe3N$6AxVOOJLi A5ddWOp2I ZhvB00mpVwq4KQ78 4.QNNcrz2tsGGFu8XXr TU7NFA Hg3T2X9.R5v6cCuzbYF8j.:18310:0:99999:7::: Paying	attention	to	the	output	is	easy.	To	note	one	difference,	let's	compare	with a	non-blocked	user: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	shadow	alisson alisson:$6$aeR.OxEqoVMnyUuq$eYxtbG6V.156mtlsK9QBZcVOjQZBm7NlcKFn5x1 yxF4mffuLYd6Wmz2R9V2iKZvuC7fgp96H7.jlQW o7OenF :18292:0:99999:7::: In	the	second	column,	where	the	password	is	stored,	for	a	blocked	user,	you	can see	that	the	system	puts	an	exclamation	point	 ! 	as	the	first	character.	This	way, the	 user	 can	 type	 his	 password	 and	 it	 will	 never	 match	 with	 the	 hash	 because there	is	an	exclamation	point	in	the	beginning. To	unblock	the	user,	type	the	following	command: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	passwd	-u	customer01 passwd:	password	expiry	information	changed. alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	shadow	customer01 customer01:$6$PExBAe3N$6AxVOOJLi A5ddWOp2I ZhvB00mpVwq4KQ78 4.QNNcrz2tsGGFu8XXr TU7NFA Hg3T2X9.R5v6cCuzbYF8j.:18310:0:99999:7::: Now,	Linux	removed	the	!	in	the	beginning	of	the	hash	and	the	user	is	able	to access	 the	 shell	 again.	 If	 the	 customer	 canceled	 the	 service	 with	 you,	 it	 is possible	to	remove	his	user.	To	execute	this	task,	you	need	to	run	the	following command: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	userdel	elvis alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	passwd	elvis It	 is	 important	 to	 remember	 that	 removing	 the	 user	 does	 not	 mean	 you	 will remove	his	home	directory	if	we	check:   alisson@devops:~$	ls	 home  alisson	customer01	elvis You	can	remove	it	manually	now	using	the	following	command. alisson@devops:~$	sudo	rm	-rf	 home elvis  Linux	 has	 this	 behavior	 to	 avoid	 you	 delete	 files	 that	 you	 might	 need	 in	 the future.	 But,	 if	 you	 are	 sure	 you	 want	 to	 remove	 everything,	 run	 the	 following command: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	userdel	-r	customer01 userdel:	customer01	mail	spool	  var mail customer01 	not	found alisson@devops:~$	ls	 home  alisson Now,	everything	is	deleted.  Managing	groups This	task	is	pretty	similar	to	the	user	management.	We	can	see	all	the	groups: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	group root:x:0: daemon:x:1: bin:x:2: sys:x:3: adm:x:4:syslog,Alisson Find	a	group	using	a	specific	name: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	group	sudo sudo:x:27:Alisson Create	a	new	user	and	add	this	user	to	the	group	sudo: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	useradd	gabriela alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	passwd	gabriela gabriela:x:1001:1001:: home gabriela: bin sh alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	group	sudo sudo:x:27:Alisson The	command	I	ran	showed	that	I	created	a	user	called	 gabriela.	This	user	is present	in	the	passwd	file	and	the	group	sudo	just	had	the	user	Alisson	added. To	add	the	new	user,	run	the	following	command: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	gpasswd	-a	gabriela	sudo Adding	user	gabriela	to	group	sudo   alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	group	sudo sudo:x:27:alisson,gabriela Perfect!	Now,	we	have	2	users	who	belong	the	sudo	group	and	we	can	switch	the user	to	see	if	the	new	one	has	the	same	permissions: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	su	-	gabriela No	directory,	logging	in	with	HOME=  $ One	 interesting	 point	 is	 if	 you	 paid	 attention,	 I	 ran	 2	 different	 commands	 to create	 a	 user	 .Firstly,	 I	 ran	 the	 adduser	 and	 after	 I	 ran	 useradd.	 What	 is	 the difference	between	the	commands? The	last	output	when	I	changed	the	user	using	the	command	su	-,	I	received	the message	of	no	directory	for	this	user.	Therefore,	the	command	useradd	does	not create	 the	 home	 folder	 for	 the	 user	 as	 the	 adduser	 does.	 So,	 we	 can	 use	 the useradd	 for	 the	 technical	 user,	 which	 does	 not	 need	 a	 password	 or	 home directory,	and	the	adduser	for	common	users.	Do	I	use	that	in	my	daily	work? No,	I	use	the	 adduser	for	everything	and	after	that,	I	remove	the	shell	and	the password,	like	the	following: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	adduser	app1	--shell	 bin false Adding	user	'app1'	… Adding	new	group	'app1'	 1002 	… Adding	new	user	'app1'	 1002 	with	group	'app1'	… Creating	home	directory	' home app1'	… Copying	files	from	' etc skel'	… Enter	new	UNIX	password: Retype	new	UNIX	password: passwd:	password	updated	successfully Changing	the	user	information	for	app1 Enter	the	new	value,	or	press	ENTER	for	the	default  Full	Name	[]: Room	Number	[]: Work	Phone	[]: Home	Phone	[]: Other	[]:  Is	the	information	correct?	[Y n]  alisson@devops:~$	sudo	passwd	-l	app1 passwd:	password	expiry	information	changed. alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	shadow	app1 app1:!$6$ArmlhXou$Ry11spiafwXfqcPkVQ3xJDCd4gbN9vcsw1.9wkDoO4N69. 3vnkHTZl.jPsMJLJmYjJwW4yS.CvvMEA5bGsZVE1:18312:0:99999:7:::  alisson@devops:~$	sudo	getent	passwd	app1   app1:x:1002:1002:,,,: home app1: bin false So,	if	you	check	the	output,	you	can	clearly	see	that	the	user	has	no	shell	and	he is	blocked	for	login.	It	would	be	so	much	easier	if	I	had	executed	the	useradd. But,	when	you	develop	a	vicious	circle,	it	is	hard	to	avoid. Now,	let's	get	back	to	the	users	in	the	group	sudo.	Deleting	the	user: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	userdel	-r	gabriela userdel:	gabriela	mail	spool	  var mail gabriela 	not	found userdel:	gabriela	home	directory	  home gabriela 	not	found Creating	the	user	again: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	adduser	gabriela Adding	user	'gabriela'	… Adding	new	group	'gabriela'	 1001 	… Adding	new	user	'gabriela'	 1001 	with	group	'gabriela'	… Creating	home	directory	' home gabriela'	… Copying	files	from	' etc skel'	… Enter	new	UNIX	password: Retype	new	UNIX	password: passwd:	password	updated	successfully Changing	the	user	information	for	gabriela Enter	the	new	value,	or	press	ENTER	for	the	default  Full	Name	[]: Room	Number	[]: Work	Phone	[]: Home	Phone	[]: Other	[]:  Is	the	information	correct?	[Y n] Adding	the	user	to	the	group: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	gpasswd	-a	gabriela	sudo Adding	user	gabriela	to	group	sudo alisson@devops:~$ Changing	the	user: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	su	-	gabriela To	run	a	command	as	administrator	 user	"root" ,	use	"sudo  ". See	"man	sudo_root"	for	details.  gabriela@devops:~$ Now,	 you	 are	 able	 to	 see	 that	 my	 shell	 has	 changed.	 Now,	 I	 am	 the	 user gabriela.	To	create	users	or	groups,	we	need	to	have	the	sudo	permission.	Let's   try	to	create	a	new	group	called	applications: gabriela@devops:~$	sudo	addgroup	applications [sudo]	password	for	gabriela: Adding	group	'applications'	 GID	1003 	… Done. Checking	if	the	group	was	created: gabriela@devops:~$	sudo	getent	group	applications applications:x:1003: Adding	a	new	user	to	this	group: gabriela@devops:~$	sudo	useradd	juergen  gabriela@devops:~$	sudo	gpasswd	-a	juergen	applications Adding	user	juergen	to	group	applications: gabriela@devops:~$	getent	group	applications applications:x:1003:juergen And	if	you	want	to	delete	the	group: gabriela@devops:~$	sudo	delgroup	applications Removing	group	'applications'	… Done. Switching	back	to	my	user: gabriela@devops:~$	exit logout alisson@devops:~$ And	 that	 is	 it.	 This	 was	 your	 QuickStart	 for	 managing	 user	 and	 groups.	 Of course,	we	could	go	so	much	deeper	in	these	topics,	but	I	still	have	to	explain how	you	can	customize	your	environment.  Working	with	Permissions The	Linux	permission	system	works	differently	from	Windows.	We	have	some numbers	associated	with	the	permission.	So,	for	example: 1	–	Execution 2	-	Writing 4	–	Reading So	you	always	have	to	make	some	math	to	apply	for	the	permission.	If	you	want   to	 assign	 the	 execution	 permission	 you	 can	 set	 as	 1,	 write	 permission	 2	 and reading	permission	4.	Write	+	Reading	is	equal	to	6,	so	the	permission	is	6.	If you	want	Read	+	Write	+	Execution	is	equal	to	7.	Let's	create	a	file	and	check its	permissions: alisson@devops:~$	touch	new_file alisson@devops:~$	ls	-la	new_file -rw-rw-r--	1	alisson	alisson	0	Feb	20	19:21	new_file The	command	touch	is	responsible	to	change	the	access	time	of	any	file.	If	the file	does	not	exist,	it	creates	one.	Checking	the	output,	you	can	see	that	we	have the	permissions:	read+write,	read+write,	read,	but	what	means	that	sequence: user	–	group	–	other In	the	same	line,	we	can	see	alisson	alisson,	the	first	one	is	the	user	owner	for this	 file	 and	 the	 second	 one	 is	 the	 group.	 By	 default,	 all	 the	 users	 created	 on Linux	have	a	group	with	the	same	name	as	the	user. If	you	remember	the	numbers	which	represent	the	permission,	we	can	make	a calculation,	read+write	=	4	+	2	=	6.	Then	we	have	the	following	permissions: 664 Therefore,	the	user	can	read	and	write.	Users	from	the	same	group	can	also	read and	 write,	 users	 who	 do	 not	 belong	 to	 the	 group	 can	 just	 read.	 Now,	 we	 can create	a	directory	and	analyze	the	permissions	as	we	did	just	now: alisson@devops:~$	mkdir	new_folder alisson@devops:~$	ls	-la		grep	new_folder drwxrwxr-x	2	alisson	alisson	4096	Feb	20	19:29	new_folder Analyzing	the	permissions,	we	can	see,	read	+	write	+	execution	for	the	user and	 group,	 and	 read	 +	 execution	 for	 the	 others.	 If	 we	 make	 the	 following association: read	+	write	+	execution	=	4	+	2	+	1	=	7 read	+	execution	=	4	+	1	=	5 Then,	we	have	 775.	What	can	we	conclude,	then?	The	default	permissions	for the	files	are	644,	and	for	the	directories	are	775.  Why	are	the	permissions	for	the	directories	and	the	files	different?	If	we paid	 attention,	 the	 only	 difference	 is	 Execution.	 The	 files	 are	 created without	this,	just	for	security.	So,	we	can	execute	the	wrong	files,	and the	folders	are	created	with	the	execution	permission	because	with	this   permission,	we	can	open	the	folders.  Nice,	but	how	can	we	change	the	file	permissions?  Changing	read	and	write	permissions The	command	used	for	changing	these	permissions	is	 chmod.	I	will	show	you how	we	can	change	it	using	numbers	and	letters.	The	experienced	Linux	users usually	 use	 numbers,	 but	 it	 does	 not	 make	 any	 difference	 whether	 you	 use numbers	or	letters.	Let’s	use	an	example	of	the	new_file: alisson@devops:~$	ls	-la	new_file -rw-rw-r--	1	alisson	alisson	0	Feb	20	19:21	new_file So,	the	permission	is	664,	which	means	that	any	user	who	is	not	me	can	read	the file	content	and	I	do	not	want	to	allow	it.	So,	I	will	change	the	permission	for other	users	to	0: alisson@devops:~$	chmod	660	new_file alisson@devops:~$	ls	-la	new_file -rw-rw----	1	alisson	alisson	0	Feb	20	19:21	new_file I	just	changed	the	permissions	for	660.	So,	let's	create	the	content	inside	this	file. Change	the	user	and	see	how	it	works: alisson@devops:~$	echo	content	not	allowed	to	other	>	new_file alisson@devops:~$	cat	new_file content	not	allowed	to	other Let's	change	the	user	to	gabriela: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	su	-	gabriela [sudo]	password	for	alisson: gabriela@devops:~$	pwd  home gabriela gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	 home total	20 drwxr-xr-x		5		root					root					4096	Feb	20	19:05	. drwxr-xr-x	24		root					root					4096	Feb	18	18:00	.. drwxr-xr-x		6		alisson		alisson		4096	Feb	20	19:29	alisson drwxr-xr-x		6		app1					app1					4096	Feb	20	19:00	app1 drwxr-xr-x		6		gabriela	gabriela	4096	Feb	20	19:12	gabriela Now,	I	will	enter	in	my	home	folder	and	try	to	see	the	file	content: gabriela@devops:~$	cd	 home alisson    gabriela@devops: home alisson$	cat	new_file cat:	new_file:	Permission	denied And	 it	 works!	 But,	 if	 we	 remember	 the	 managing	 groups'	 part,	 this	 user	 has permission	to	use	sudo.	So,	I	will	add	itself	in	the	group	Alisson,	and	let's	see what	happens: gabriela@devops: home alisson$	sudo	gpasswd	-a	gabriela	alisson [sudo]	password	for	gabriela: Adding	user	gabriela	to	group	Alisson If	we	type	the	command	groups,	we	can	see	the	groups	that	this	user	belongs	to: gabriela@devops: home alisson$	groups gabriela	sudo Thus,	 it	 means	 that	 the	 new	 user	 is	 not	 able	 to	 be	 used	 in	 this	 session.	 Let’s logout	and	login	again,	and	see	if	it	changes: gabriela@devops: home alisson$	logout alisson@devops:~$	sudo	su	-	gabriela gabriela@devops:~$	groups gabriela	sudo	alisson Now,	the	group	is	loaded.	So,	let's	try	to	see	the	file	content	again: gabriela@devops:~$	cd	 home alisson   gabriela@devops: home alisson$	cat	new_file content	not	allowed	to	other And	it	is	possible	to	see	the	file	content.	So	this	is	how	the	permission	works.	I show	 how	 we	 can	 change	 the	 permission	 using	 the	 number.	 If	 you	 want	 to change	it	using	letters,	it	is	basically	the	same.	Let's	try: gabriela@devops: home alisson$	cd gabriela@devops:~$	touch	letters_file gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-rw-r--	1	gabriela	gabriela	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file To	remove	all	the	permission	to	others: gabriela@devops:~$	chmod	o=	letters_file gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-rw----	1	gabriela	gabriela	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file Then,	we	can	see	that	I	just	had	to	type	o=,	which	means	other	=	nothing,	and the	permissions	were	set.	I	could	just	add	the	execution	permission:   gabriela@devops:~$	chmod	o+x	letters_file gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-rw---x	1	gabriela	gabriela	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file Or,	I	can	set	the	permissions	to	read	for	all,	and	write	just	for	the	owner: gabriela@devops:~$	chmod	g=rx,o=rx	letters_file gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-r-xr-x	1	gabriela	gabriela	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file And	if	I	want	to	give	the	write	permission	to	everyone,	I	will	do	the	following: gabriela@devops:~$	chmod	+w	letters_file gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-rwxr-x	1	gabriela	gabriela	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file The	same	command	works	for	the	directories.  Change	the	owner	of	files	and	executing	scripts The	same	way	as	 chmod	is	used	for	permissions,	 chown	is	used	for	ownership. Let	me	use	the	same	files	that	we	have: gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-rwxr-x	1	gabriela	gabriela	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file The	owner	is	gabriela,	and	the	group	is	gabriela	too.	In	the	previous	example, I	have	added	the	user	gabriela	to	the	group	alisson,	and	then	the	user	was	able to	access	the	file.	But	this	time,	I	will	do	it	differently: gabriela@devops:~$	chown	gabriela:alisson	letters_file gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-rwxr-x	1	gabriela	alisson	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file Now,	the	group	owner	for	this	file	is	alisson.	If	I	want	to	change	the	user,	I	can run	the	command	as	follows: gabriela@devops:~$	sudo	chown	juergen	letters_file [sudo]	password	for	gabriela:  gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-rwxr-x	1	juergen	alisson	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file Jurgen	is	the	owner	of	this	file.	We	can	use	the	command	chown	to	change	the user	and	the	group	for	a	file	or	directory.	But	we	have	a	command	which	can also	be	used	to	change	the	group: gabriela@devops:~$	sudo	chgrp	gabriela	letters_file   gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	letters_file -rw-rwxr-x	1	juergen	gabriela	0	Feb	20	19:47	letters_file The	 group	 is	 now	 changed.	 Therefore,	 the	 command	 chgrp	 changes	 only	 the group,	and	the	command	chown	changes	the	owner,	or	the	owner	and	the	group. Thus,	to	finish	this	chapter,	we	are	just	missing	to	see	how	to	execute	a	script.	So let's	create	a	simple	one: gabriela@devops:~$	echo	"echo	this	is	a	simple	script"> simple_script.sh gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	simple_script.sh -rw-rw-r--	1	gabriela	gabriela	29	Feb	20	20:05	simple_script.sh Here,	we	have	the	script	created.	To	execute	it,	run	it	as	follows: gabriela@devops:~$	. simple_script.sh -su:	. simple_script.sh:	Permission	denied Permission	denied!	This	happens	because,	if	we	analyze	the	previous	command run	 and	 check	 the	 permissions,	 there	 is	 no	 x,	 which	 represents	 the	 execution permission.	Then,	set	the	following	permission: gabriela@devops:~$	chmod	+x	simple_script.sh Run	the	script	again: gabriela@devops:~$	. simple_script.sh this	is	a	simple	script Let's	check	the	permissions	one	more	time: gabriela@devops:~$	ls	-la	simple_script.sh -rwxrwxr-x	1	gabriela	gabriela	29	Feb	20	20:05	simple_script.sh The	 x	 is	 in	 all	 the	 permission	 groups	 for	 the	 users,	 groups,	 and	 others.	 So, everyone	can	execute	it.	If	you	still	give	the	execution	just	for	the	file	owner	or for	 the	 group,	 you	 can	 use	 chmod	 for	 it,	 and	 use	 the	 same	 math	 to	 set	 the permissions.   CHAPTER	3 Setting	Up	a	Service  T  his	 chapter	 will	 explain	 how	 the	 Linux	 Package	 system	 works,	 how	 to install	 a	 package,	 install	 a	 service,	 configure	 it,	 and	 run	 your	 first  application	in	your	first	LAMP	 Linux	Apache	MySQL	PHP 	server.  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  Learning	how	to	install	a	package  APT  Installing	the	Apache  Configuring	your	service Creating	a	VHost  Installing	MySQL  Configuring	the	service Creating	a	database	and	tables  Deploying	your	application  Installing	PHP Deploying	WordPress  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Understand	the	Linux	package	system Install	packages	using	APT Setup	a	web	server   Setup	a	database	server Deploy	an	application  Learning	how	to	install	a	package Most	 of	 the	 Linux	 distributions	 have	 a	 package	 manager	 by	 default.	 It	 can	 be YUM,	APT,	Zypper,	pacman,	slackapt,	etc.	Each	one	has	its	own	particularities, but	all	were	made	for	the	same	purpose,	to	install	the	packages	that	are	basically the	 Linux	 programs,	 via	 centralized	 repositories	 which	 are	 distributed	 all	 over the	world. In	the	first	chapter,	I	gave	a	brief	explanation	about	the	Linux	distributions	and some	differences.	Some	of	them	are	in	the	package	management	systems.	Now,	I am	going	to	give	2	examples	of	the	most	famous	package	managers. Debian	 based	 distributions,	 like	 Ubuntu,	 have	 the	 APT	  Advanced	 Package Tool .	 this: http:  de.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu.	It	is	just	an	Apache	web	server,	and	in it,	are	stored	several	packages	which	we	can	choose	and	install. RedHat	 based	 distributions,	 like	 CentOS,	 have	 YUM	  Yellow	 Dog	 Update Manager ,	which	will	soon	be	replaced	by	the	DNF	 Dandified	Yum ,	the	new substitute	 like https:  dl.fedoraproject.org pub epel 7 x86_64 ,	 and	 also	 stores	 several packages. Now,	let's	focus	on	Debian	which	is	our	goal	here,	once	we	are	using	Ubuntu.  of	 YUM.	  repository	  repository	  connects	  central	  central	  uses	  also	  like	  to	  It	  It	  a	  a	  APT If	 you	 run	 just	 the	 command	 apt	 without	 any	 parameter,	 you	 will	 see	 the following	output: alisson@devops:~$	apt apt	1.6.11	 amd64  Usage:	apt	[options]	command  apt	is	a	commandline	package	manager	and	provides	commands	for searching	and	managing	as	well	as	querying	information	about packages. It	provides	the	same	functionality	as	the	specialized	APT	tools, like	apt-get	and	apt-cache,	but	enables	options	more	suitable	for interactive	use	by	default.  Most	used	commands:   list	-	list	packages	based	on	package	names search	-	search	in	package	descriptions show	-	show	package	details install	-	install	packages remove	-	remove	packages autoremove	-	Remove	automatically	all	unused	packages update	-	update	list	of	available	packages upgrade	-	upgrade	the	system	by	installing upgrading	packages full-upgrade	-	upgrade	the	system	by	removing installing upgrading packages edit-sources	-	edit	the	source	information	file  See	apt 8 	for	more	information	about	the	available	commands. Configuration	options	and	syntax	is	detailed	in	apt.conf 5 . Information	about	how	to	configure	sources	can	be	found	in sources.list 5 . Package	and	version	choices	can	be	expressed	via apt_preferences 5 . Security	details	are	available	in	apt-secure 8 . This	APT	has	Super	Cow	Powers. Therefore,	 the	 options	 are	 self-explained.	 Let's	 use	 them	 in	 practice.	 One interesting	thing	is	the	command	top: top	-	18:19:11	up	2	days,	2:34,	1	user,	load	average:	0.04,	0.03, 0.00 Tasks:	92	total,	1	running,	50	sleeping,	0	stopped,	0	zombie %Cpu s :	0.0	us,	0.0	sy,	0.0	ni,100.0	id,	0.0	wa,	0.0	hi,	0.0	si, 0.0	st KiB	Mem	:	1008816	total,	133020	free,	126512	used,	749284 buff cache KiB	Swap:	2017276	total,	2016752	free,	524	used.	716548	avail	Mem PID	USER	PR	NI	VIRT	RES	SHR	S	%CPU	%MEM	TIME+	COMMAND 28427	alisson	20	0	107988	3460	2448	S	0.3	0.3	0:00.14	sshd 28462	alisson	20	0	42788	3940	3344	R	0.3	0.4	0:00.25	top  1	root			20		0		77992		9104		6680	S	0.0	0.9		0:02.58	systemd 2	root			20		0				0			0			0	S	0.0	0.0		0:00.00	kthreadd 4	root				0	-20				0			0			0	I	0.0	0.0		0:00.00	kworker 0:0H 6	root				0	-20				0			0			0	I	0.0	0.0		0:00.00	mm_percpu_wq 7	root			20		0				0			0			0	S	0.0	0.0		0:00.55	ksoftirqd 0 8	root			20		0				0			0			0	I		0.0		0.0		0:19.94	rcu_sched  To	exit	from	the	top,	press	q.	This	command	basically	shows	the	current	state	of your	 machine,	 the	 state	 of	 memory,	 CPU,	 processes	 running,	 etc.	 There	 is another	 version	 of	 top	 which	 is	 called	 htop.	 It	 does	 exactly	 the	 same	 thing. However,	it	has	a	better	interface,	and	therefore,	before	we	install	that	version,   run	the	following	command: alisson@devops:~$	sudo	su	- [sudo]	password	for	alisson: root@devops:~ The	previous	command	changes	your	current	user	to	the	user	root.	Until	now,	we were	 running	 the	 command	 sudo	 before	 every	 command	 which	 needs	 more permission.	 Now,	 we	 need	 not	 type	 sudo	 before	 the	 command	 every	 time because	we	are	already	the	administrator	of	this	server.	Or,	you	can	say	that	we are	the	root	user. Sometimes,	when	we	create	a	server	based	on	an	image.	The	local	cache	of	APT is	completely	outdated.	So,	we	need	to	clean	it	and	update	using	the	following commands: root@devops:~	apt	clean root@devops:~	apt	update Hit:1	http:  de.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu	bionic	InRelease Hit:2	http:  de.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu	bionic-updates	InRelease Hit:3	http:  de.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu	bionic-backports InRelease Hit:4	http:  de.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu	bionic-security	InRelease Reading	package	lists…	Done Building	dependency	tree Reading	state	information…	Done 65	packages	can	be	upgraded.	Run	'apt	list	--upgradable'	to	see them. root@devops:~ Now,	you	have	the	local	cache	updated.	We	can	try	to	find	the	htop	and	see	if	it is	available	to	install: root@devops:~	apt	search	htop Sorting…	Done Full	Text	Search…	Done aha bionic	0.4.10.6-4	amd64 ANSI	color	to	HTML	converter  htop bionic,now	2.1.0-3	amd64	[installed,automatic] interactive	processes	viewer  libauthen-oath-perl bionic	2.0.1-1	all Perl	module	for	OATH	One	Time	Passwords  pftools bionic	3+dfsg-2build1	amd64 build	and	search	protein	and	DNA	generalized	profiles   Analyzing	the	previous	output,	we	can	say	that	 htop	is	available.	So,	to	install the	package,	we	use	the	following	command: root@devops:~	apt	install	htop	-y Reading	package	lists…	Done Building	dependency	tree Reading	state	information…	Done htop	is	already	the	newest	version	 2.1.0-3 . htop	set	to	manually	installed. 0	upgraded,	0	newly	installed,	0	to	remove	and	65	not	upgraded. root@devops:~ The	package	is	installed	now.	So,	run	the	following	command: CPU[ 0.0%]	Tasks:	29,	28	thr;	1	running Mem[128M 985M] Load	average:	0.07	0.02	0.00 Swp[	524K 1.92G]	Uptime:	2	days,	02:45:09  PID	USER	PRI	NI	VIRT	RES	SHR	S	CPU%	MEM%	TIME+	Command	28771	root 20	0	32468	4868	3764	R	0.0	0.5	0:00.02	htop	1	root	20	0	77992	9104 6680	S	0.0	0.9	0:02.58	 sbin init	maybe-ubiquity 394	root	19	-1	100M	17652	16796	S	0.0	1.7	0:00.36  lib systemd systemd-journald 420	root	20	0	103M	1852	1664	S	0.0	0.2	0:00.00	 sbin lvmetad	-f 421	root	20	0	45836	4476	2888	S	0.0	0.4	0:00.87  lib systemd systemd-udevd 496	systemd-t	20	0	138M	3256	2744	S	0.0	0.3	0:00.00  lib systemd systemd-timesyncd 491	systemd-t	20	0	138M	3256	2744	S	0.0	0.3	0:00.20  lib systemd systemd-timesyncd 672	systemd-n	20	0	80048	5076	4484	S	0.0	0.5	0:00.19  lib systemd systemd-networkd 696	systemd-r	20	0	70636	4916	4356	S	0.0	0.5	0:00.19  lib systemd systemd-resolved In	this	simple	output,	we	are	able	to	see	some	improvements.	For	example,	we now	have	a	bar	to	indicate	the	amount	of	memory	used	in	the	server.	It	is	a	good tool	to	analyze	the	current	state	of	your	server,	but,	it	is	not	used	much	in	the production	system	because	it	consumes	more	memory	than	the	traditional	top. So,	let’s	remove	this	package	using	the	following	command: root@devops:~	apt	remove	htop Reading	package	lists…	Done Building	dependency	tree Reading	state	information…	Done   The	following	packages	will	be	REMOVED: htop	ubuntu-server 0	upgraded,	0	newly	installed,	2	to	remove	and	64	not	upgraded. After	this	operation,	269	kB	disk	space	will	be	freed. Do	you	want	to	continue?	[Y n]	y  Reading	database	…	102467	files	and	directories	currently installed.

Beside	 the	 commands,	 we	 also	 have	 some important	 files	 which	 are	 required	 to	 install	 some	 packages	 that	 may	 not	 be available	in	the	official	repositories. The	first	important	file	is	 etc apt sources.list: root@devops:~	cat	 etc apt sources.list 	See	http:  help.ubuntu.com community UpgradeNotes	for	how	to upgrade	to 	newer	versions	of	the	distribution.  deb	http:  de.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu	bionic	main	restricted deb	http:  de.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu	bionic-updates	main restricted Above-mentioned	is	an	example	of	the	first	few	entries	from	the	sources.list. These	are	the	lines	representing	the	remote	repositories	where	the	packages	are found.	If	you	want	to	add	a	new	repository,	you	can	just	find	the	respective	line and	add	at	the	end	of	this	file,	for	example: deb	http:  ppa.launchpad.net canonical-kernel-team unstable ubuntu bionic	main In	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 URL,	 you	 can	 see	 that	 it	 starts	 with	 PPA	  Personal Packages	Archines .	These	are	the	useful	repositories	that	are	not	included	in the	distribution	by	default,	but	you	may	find	some	packages	which	you	want	to use. Another	important	directory	is:	 var cache apt .	In	the	beginning,	I	explained that	the	APT	stores	the	cache	inside	the	Linux,	and	if	it	is	too	old,	we	need	to clean	 and	 update	 it.	 This	 folder	 also	 downloads	 the	 packages	 installed	 in	 our system,	for	example:  root@devops:~	apt	install	htop	--download-only   Reading	package	lists…	Done Building	dependency	tree Reading	state	information…	Done The	following	NEW	packages	will	be	installed: htop 0	upgraded,	1	newly	installed,	0	to	remove	and	64	not	upgraded. Need	to	get	80.0	kB	of	archives. After	this	operation,	221	kB	of	additional	disk	space	will	be	used. Get:1	http:  de.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu	bionic main	amd64	htop amd64	2.1.0-3	[80.0	kB] Fetched	80.0	kB	in	0s	 451	kB s  Download	complete	and	in	download	only	mode I	 ran	 the	 APT	 installation	 just	 to	 download	 the	 package	 using	 the	 option	 – download-only,	and	if	we	check	the	directory:  root@devops:~	ls	 var cache apt archives  htop_2.1.0-3_amd64.deb	lock	partial You	can	see	the	package	there.	Now,	if	you	run	the	following	clean	command:  root@devops:~	apt	clean root@devops:~	ls	 var cache apt archives  lock	partial The	package	is	not	there	anymore.  Installing	Apache We	installed	one	basic	package	to	learn	how	APT	works.	Now,	let's	install	a	real one.	The	Apache	web	server	is	currently	the	most	used	web	servers	in	the	world. You	 can	 deploy	 any	 application	 using	 it	 as	 a	 Load	 Balancer,	 cache	 for	 static files,	proxy	for	another	web	server,	and	many	other	options	that	depend	on	your usage.	To	install	Apache,	use	the	following	command: root@devops:~	apt	install	apache2	-y Reading	package	lists…	Done Building	dependency	tree Reading	state	information…	Done The	following	additional	packages	will	be	installed: apache2-bin	apache2-data	apache2-utils	libapr1	libaprutil1 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3	libaprutil1-ldap	liblua5.2-0	ssl-cert If	the	installation	ran	well	for	you,	it	is	possible	to	validate	if	Apache	is	installed and	running	using	the	following	command:   root@devops:~	service	apache2	status apache2.service	-	The	Apache	HTTP	Server Loaded:	loaded	  lib systemd system apache2.service;	disabled; vendor	preset:	enabled  Drop-In:	 lib systemd system apache2.service.d  └─apache2-systemd.conf  Active:	active	 running 	since	Mon	2020-07-06	12:56:38	UTC;	11s	ago Process:	22810	ExecStart= usr sbin apachectl	start	 code=exited, status=0 SUCCESS  Pay	attention	to	the	part	where	says	it	Active	 running ,	or,	you	can	also	use	the command	ss	-ntpl:  root@devops:~	ss	-ntpl  We	can	see	Apache	running	on	port	80,	with	the	PID	22848.	PID	means	process identification.	 Now,	 the	 server	 is	 up	 and	 running.	 Let's	 check	 the	 access	 via browser: http:  192.168.178.62    Figure	3.1  This	is	the	Apache	default	page	when	the	server	is	running	on	Ubuntu.	Usually, this	page	is	different	depending	on	your	OS. Now,	you	can	say	that	you	have	setup	a	web	server.	However,	we	know	that	the websites	are	not	just	made	using	HTML.	There	is	a	lot	of	back-end	processing. Usually,	 it	 is	 PHP.	 Of	 course,	 you	 can	 develop	 your	 website	 using	 any	 of	 the dozens	of	programming	languages	that	are	available.	But,	I	am	still	pretty	sure that	PHP	is	the	most	common	used	for	most	of	the	websites.  Installing	PHP In	this	part,	let's	install	PHP	and	create	a	simple	page	to	check	if	it	is	installed, and	what	are	the	modules	available	to	use	with	it: root@devops:~	apt	install	php	-y The	installation	is	simple	using	APT.	When	we	install	PHP	and	Apache,	there are	many	Apache	modules	that	are	installed	together.	You	can	run	the	following command	to	check	them: root@devops:~	a2enmod Your	choices	are:	access_compat	actions	alias	allowmethods	asis auth_basic	auth_digest	auth_form	authn_anon	authn_core	authn_dbd authn_dbm	authn_file	authn_socache	authnz_fcgi	authnz_ldap authz_core	authz_dbd	authz_dbm	authz_groupfile	authz_host   authz_owner	authz_user	autoindex	buffer	cache	cache_disk cache_socache	cern_meta	cgi	cgid	charset_lite	data	dav	dav_fs dav_lock	dbd	deflate	dialup	dir	dump_io	echo	env	expires	ext_filter file_cache	filter	headers	heartbeat	heartmonitor	http2	ident imagemap	include	info	lbmethod_bybusyness	lbmethod_byrequests lbmethod_bytraffic	lbmethod_heartbeat	ldap	log_debug	log_forensic lua	macro	mime	mime_magic	mpm_event	mpm_preforkmpm_worker negotiation	php7.2	proxy	proxy_ajp	proxy_balancer proxy_connectproxy_express	proxy_fcgi	proxy_fdpass	proxy_ftp proxy_hcheck	proxy_html	proxy_http	proxy_http2	proxy_scgi proxy_wstunnel	ratelimit	reflector	remoteip	reqtimeout	request rewrite	sed	session	session_cookie	session_crypto	session_dbd setenvif	slotmem_plain	slotmem_shm	socache_dbm	socache_memcache socache_shmcb	speling	ssl	status	substitute	suexec	unique_id userdir	usertrack	vhost_alias	xml2enc Which	module s 	do	you	want	to	enable	 wildcards	ok ? There	are	many	options,	but	the	one	we	are	looking	for	is	php7.2: root@devops:~	a2enmod	php7.2 Considering	dependency	mpm_prefork	for	php7.2: Considering	conflict	mpm_event	for	mpm_prefork: Considering	conflict	mpm_worker	for	mpm_prefork: Module	mpm_prefork	already	enabled Considering	conflict	php5	for	php7.2: Module	php7.2	already	enabled The	 command	 a2enmod,	 enables	 the	 php7.2	 module,	 which	 is	 responsible	 to integrate	Apache	and	PHP.	When	we	access	a	PHP	page	via	a	browser,	Apache will	call	that	module	which	will	call	the	PHP	interpreter	and	run	the	code.	Let's create	a	simple	page	as	an	example: root@devops:~	vim	 var www html info.php  <?php  phpinfo  ;  ?>  This	code	is	the	simplest	code	that	you	can	run	on	PHP	to	check	if	everything	is running.	When	you	call	that	page	via	a	browser,	you	will	see	the	following:   Figure	3.2  Now,	 you	 can	 see	 via	 browser,	 everything	 which	 is	 installed	 with	 your	 PHP installation,	 and	 make	 sure	 that	 PHP	 is	 running.	 When	 we	 are	 running	 a complete	 application	 within	 a	 web	 server,	 PHP	 and	 Apache	 are	 enough	 to publish	the	information	and	make	it	available	for	access	everywhere. However,	full	systems	store	and	manage	data,	and	in	order	to	do	it,	we	need	a Database	 Management	 System,	 which	 can	 be	 many.	 We	 have	 as	 much database	 systems	 as	 we	 have	 programming	 languages,	 and	 in	 different categories,	SQL,	NoSQL,	Key	Values,	etc. The	most	popular	DBMS	running	on	web	servers	is	MySQL MariaDB.	So,	let's install	it	and	test.  Installing	MariaDB The	most	popular	DBMS	running	on	web	servers	is	the	MySQL,	then	let's	install it	and	make	a	test: root@devops:~	apt	install	mariadb-server	mariadb-client	-y After	the	installation	completes,	run	the	following	command:   root@devops:~	mysql Welcome	to	the	MariaDB	monitor.	Commands	end	with	;	or	\g. Your	MariaDB	connection	id	is	30 Server	version:	10.1.44-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.18.04.1	Ubuntu	18.04  Copyright	 c 	2000,	2018,	Oracle,	MariaDB	Corporation	Ab	and others.  Type	'help;'	or	'\h'	for	help.	Type	'\c'	to	clear	the	current	input statement.  MariaDB	[ none ]>  Now	we	are	inside	the	MariaDB	console. In	the	past,	we	usually	used	MySQL.	But,	after	Oracle	bought	it,	a	fork	called MariaDB	 was	 created	 and	 it	 became	 more	 and	 more	 popular.	 Its	 API	 is completely	compatible	with	MySQL.	We	will	run	some	commands	here	and	you can	use	exactly	the	same	in	an	original	MySQL	server. To	create	a	database,	you	need	to	run	the	following	command: MariaDB	[ none ]>	create	database	chapter03; Query	OK,	1	row	affected	 0.00	sec   MariaDB	[ none ]>	use	chapter03; Database	changed MariaDB	[chapter03]> You	can	see	that	we	created	a	database,	called	chapter03,	with	no	tables: MariaDB	[chapter03]>	show	tables; Empty	set	 0.00	sec  We	can	create	one	by	running	the	following	command: MariaDB	[chapter03]>	create	table	users id	integer	primary	key auto_increment,	name	varchar 50  ; Query	OK,	0	rows	affected	 1.77	sec  We	just	created	a	table	with	2	columns,	one	called	ID,	which	will	store	numbers, and	 the	 other	 called	 name,	 which	 will	 receive	 strings.	 To	 check	 the	 table structure,	use	the	following	command:   I	 just	 entered	 4	 different	 users,	 alisson,	 gabriela,	 juergen,	 and	 leonardo	 to demonstrate	how	we	can	see	the	data	stored	in	a	table: MariaDB	[chapter03]>select	*	from	users;  +----+----------+ 	id		name	 +----+----------+ 	1		alisson	 	2		gabriela	 	3		juergen	 	4		leonardo	 +----+----------+ 4	rows	in	set	 0.00	sec  Notice	 that	 I	 just	 entered	 the	 names	 and	 the	 numbers	 were	 automatically increased	 by	 the	 database.	 This	 is	 normal	 when	 we	 have	 an	 auto-increment column.	We	did	that	just	to	make	sure	the	database	server	is	running.	Now,	we have	a	full	setup	which	we	call	LAMP	 Linux	Apache	MariaDB	PHP 	and	we   are	ready	to	deploy	a	real	application. For	 that,	 we	 will	 use	 WordPress	 and	 see	 how	 it	 works.	 Leave	 the	 MariaDB console	by	pressing	Ctrl	+	D.  Installing	WordPress The	first	task	is	to	download	WordPress	from	the	official	website: root@devops:~	wget	https:  wordpress.org latest.tar.gz --2020-07-06	13:51:03--	https:  wordpress.org latest.tar.gz Resolving	wordpress.org	 wordpress.org …	198.143.164.252 Connecting	to	wordpress.org	 wordpress.org 198.143.164.252:443… connected.

We	 will	 rename	 it	 to	 wp- config.php	and	edit	setting	the	database	information	for	our	website.	Now,	let's do	it: root@devops: var www html wordpress	mv	wp-config-sample.php	wp-   config.php root@devops: var www html wordpress	vim	wp-config.php   **	The	name	of	the	database	for	WordPress	*  define 'DB_NAME',	'database_name_here' ;   **	MySQL	database	username	*  define 'DB_USER',	'username_here' ;   **	MySQL	database	password	*  define 'DB_PASSWORD',	'password_here' ;   **	MySQL	hostname	*  define 'DB_HOST',	'localhost' ;   **	Database	Charset	to	use	in	creating	database	tables.	*  define 'DB_CHARSET',	'utf8' ;   **	The	Database	Collate	type.

If	you	are	working	with	webhosting	or	as	a	freelance	web	developer, it	 can	 be	 very	 useful	 for	 you,	 because	 you	 can	 create	 the	 websites	 using WordPress	and	now	you	know	how	to	set	up	and	manage	your	server.	It	was	just a	prerequisite	for	the	next	chapters	where	we	will	automate	everything.   CHAPTER	4 Configuring	a	Reverse	Proxy	with	Nginx T  his	chapter	aims	to	explain	how	a	reverse	proxy	is	used	and	what	it	does. You	 will	 also	 learn	 how	 to	 create	 a	 simple	 page	 in	 Python	 using	 the  framework	Flask	and	make	it	available	using	the	web	server	Gunicorn.  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  Installing	Nginx Installing	Python  Creating	a	simple	page	using	Flask  Configuring	reverse	proxy  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to	answer:  What	is	Nginx	and	how	it	works What	is	a	reverse	proxy The	basics	of	a	web	page	in	Python How	to	deploy	an	application	using	Gunicorn  Installing	the	Nginx Nginx,	the	name	is	made	up	by	the	sound	when	you	pronounce	Engine	X.	It	is also	 one	 of	 the	 most	 famous	 web	 servers,	 more	 frequently	 used	 as	 a	 load balancer	 or	 as	 a	 proxy	 pass.	 One	 of	 its	 own	 best	 capabilities	 is	 working	 with threads	 to	 respond	 a	 lot	 of	 requisitions	 in	 parallel.	 It	 is	 frequently	 used	 with Python	 applications.	 It	 receives	 the	 requisitions	 and	 passes	 to	 another	 Python server	like	Gunicorn,	as	we	will	see	in	the	following	pages.   To	begin	with,	let’s	install	Nginx	by	running	the	following	command: root@devops:~	apt	install	nginx	-y Reading	package	lists…	Done Building	dependency	tree Reading	state	information…	Done The	following	additional	packages	will	be	installed: fontconfig-config	fonts-dejavu-core	libfontconfig1	libgd3	libjbig0 libjpeg-turbo8	libjpeg8	libnginx-mod-http-geoip	libnginx-mod-http- image-filter libnginx-mod-http-xslt-filter	libnginx-mod-mail	libnginx-mod-stream libtiff5	libwebp6	libxpm4	nginx-common	nginx-core Suggested	packages: libgd-tools	fcgiwrap	nginx-doc The	following	NEW	packages	will	be	installed: fontconfig-config	fonts-dejavu-core	libfontconfig1	libgd3	libjbig0 libjpeg-turbo8	libjpeg8	libnginx-mod-http-geoip	libnginx-mod-http- image-filter libnginx-mod-http-xslt-filter	libnginx-mod-mail	libnginx-mod-stream libtiff5	libwebp6	libxpm4	nginx	nginx-common	nginx-core 0	upgraded,	18	newly	installed,	0	to	remove	and	72	not	upgraded. Need	to	get	2,461	kB	of	archives. After	 the	 installation	 finishes,	 you	 can	 check	 all	 the	 configuration	 files	 in	 this folder	by	the	following	command: root@devops:~	ls	 etc nginx  conf.d	fastcgi_params	koi-win	modules-available	nginx.conf scgi_params	sites-enabled	uwsgi_params fastcgi.conf	koi-utf	mime.types	modules-enabled	proxy_params	sites- available	snippets	win-utf Probably,	 you	 saw	 some	 similarities	 with	 Apache.	 For	 example,	 here	 also,	 we have	the	folder	sites-enable	and	sites-disable.	So,	you	already	know	what these	directories	do.	However,	the	most	important	is	the	nginx.conf.	that	stores the	 main	 configuration	 of	 the	 web	 server.	 We	 can	 use	 the	 command	 grep	 to check	the	enabled	lines,	in	other	words,	the	lines	which	are	not	commentaries: root@devops:~	grep	-v	""	 etc nginx nginx.conf user	www-data; worker_processes	auto; pid	 run nginx.pid; include	 etc nginx modules-enabled *.conf;   worker_connections	768;  events	{  }  http	{  sendfile	on; tcp_nopush	on; tcp_nodelay	on;  keepalive_timeout	65; types_hash_max_size	2048;  include	 etc nginx mime.types; default_type	application octet-stream;  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers	on;  access_log	 var log nginx access.log; error_log	 var log nginx error.log;  gzip	on;  include	 etc nginx conf.d *.conf; include	 etc nginx sites-enabled *;  } Therefore,	 this	 file	 can	 show	 you	 the	 important	 lines,	 like	 the	 number	 of connections	 per	 worker,	 so	 each	 worker	 will	 be	 in	 charge	 to	 respond	 768 connections.	By	default,	the	value	is	1,	but	we	can	have	at	least	one	per	CPU processor.	If	you	want	to	check	how	many	processors	you	have	in	your	CPU,	run the	following	command: root@devops:~	cat	 proc cpuinfo		grep	processor processor				:	0 The	last	command	shows	you	that	you	have	only	one	processor	in	your	CPU.	I ran	this	command	on	my	VM.	Since	I	have	only	one	processor,	if	I	run	in	my physical	machine,	the	result	is	as	follows:  alisson@avell:~$	cat	 proc cpuinfo		grep	processor processor			:	0 processor			:	1 processor			:	2 processor			:	3 processor			:	4 processor			:	5 processor			:	6 processor			:	7	show	-	show	package	details   Therefore,	in	this	case,	I	can	configure	my	Nginx	to	use	8	workers.	If	you	want to	do	that,	just	add	the	following	line	below	the	worker	connections: Worker_processes	8; Restart	your	server	and	the	configuration	is	enabled. We	just	saw	some	important	files.	Now	is	the	time	to	test	our	web	server.	In	the last	chapter,	we	installed	Apache	web	server	in	the	virtual	machine.	So,	probably it	is	still	running.	Let's	check	if	there	is	any	process	running	on	port	80:  The	last	command	is	printed	on	the	screen.	Of	all	the	services	that	are	currently listening	in	my	VM,	if	Apache	is	one	of	them,	let's	stop	it,	disable	the	server,	and start	Nginx: root@devops:~	systemctl	stop	apache2 root@devops:~	systemctl	disable	apache2 Synchronizing	state	of	apache2.service	with	SysV	service	script with	 lib systemd systemd-sysv-install. Executing:	 lib systemd systemd-sysv-install	disable	apache2 Now,	 even	 if	 you	 restart	 your	 VM,	 Apache	 will	 be	 still	 stopped.	 To	 start	 and enable	Nginx,	run	the	following	commands: root@devops:~	systemctl	start	nginx root@devops:~	systemctl	enable	nginx   Synchronizing	state	of	nginx.service	with	SysV	service	script	with  lib systemd systemd-sysv-install. Executing:	 lib systemd systemd-sysv-install	enable	nginx Open	 IP	 address	 http:  192.168.178.62 :  the	 browser	  to	 check	  index	 page:  the	  the	  in	  Figure	4.1  It	 is	 interesting	 that	 it	 is	 displaying	 the	 Apache	 example	 page.	 This	 happens because	Nginx	is	using	the	same	folder	as	Apache	for	the	document	root.	You can	check	that	using	the	following	command: root@devops:~	grep	-v	""	 etc nginx sites-enabled default  server	{  listen	80	default_server; listen	[::]:80	default_server;  root	 var www html;  server_name	_;  location	 	{  }  try_files	$uri	$uri 	=404;  index	index.html	index.htm	index.nginx-debian.html;  } The	 grep	 command	 showed	 you	 that	 the	 document	 root	 is	 defined	 as  var www html,	 which	 is	 the	 same	 as	 Apache.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 see	 the	 default index	page	of	Nginx,	run	the	following	command: root@devops:~	cp	-v	 usr share nginx html index.html  var www html  ' usr share nginx html index.html'	->	' var www html index.html'   The	 grep	 command	 showed	 you	 that	 the	 document	 root	 is	 defined	 as  var www html,	 which	 is	 the	 same	 as	 Apache.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 see	 the	 default index	page	of	the	Nginx,	run	the	following	command:  Now,	you	can	see	the	Nginx	default	page.  Figure	4.2  Installing	Python Python,	nowadays,	is	one	of	the	most	famous	programming	languages,	mainly	in the	areas,	like	Data	Science	and	DevOps.	It	is	frequently	used	to	automate	Linux tasks	and	integrate	systems	using	REST	APIs.	Some	years	ago,	I	worked	in	a system	called	BeavOps.	I	was	responsible	to	make	the	enrollment	of	the	students for	the	consulting	company	I	used	to	work	for. That	system	was	receiving	a	JSON	file	from	the	CRM	with	the	student	data,	the respective	course,	and	the	starting	and	ending	date.	The	mission	was	to	create some	 routines	 with	 this	 data	 which	 will	 integrate	 many	 different	 tools,	 like Gitlab,	 Jenkins,	 Apache,	 MongoDB,	 etc,	 aiming	 to	 create	 a	 development environment	 for	 the	 students	 and	 with	 a	 CI CD	 pipeline.	 That	 system	 was completely	made	up	using	Python,	Flask,	and	MongoDB	to	store	the	data. To	install	Python,	we	basically	need	two	packages: root@devops:~	apt	install	python3	python3-pip	-y Reading	package	lists…	Done Building	dependency	tree Reading	state	information…	Done python3	is	already	the	newest	version	 3.6.7-1~18.04 . python3	set	to	manually	installed. So,	the	options	are	self-explained.	Therefore,	let's	use	them	in	practice.	After	the installation	finishes,	install	the	Flask	framework	using	pip:   Now,	your	environment	is	ready	to	run	a	Python	application.  Creating	a	simple	page	using	Flask Flask	is	a	micro-framework	for	Python,	which	is	perfect	for	you	to	create	your APIs.	Now,	you	will	learn	how	to	create	a	simple	Hello	World	using	this	micro- framework	 and	 Python.	 You	 will	 also	 learn	 all	 the	 steps	 to	 deploy	 your application	using	Nginx	and	Gunicorn. Let's	create	a	file,	called	app.py	with	the	following	content: from	flask	import	Flask  app	=	Flask __name__   @app.route " "  def	index  :  return	"DevOps	with	Linux"  if	__name__	==	"__main__":  app.run debug=True,host="0.0.0.0"   Now,	run	the	following	command: root@devops:~	python3	app.py  *	Serving	Flask	app	"app"	 lazy	loading  *	Environment:	production  WARNING:	This	is	a	development	server.	Do	not	use	it	in	a production	deployment. Use	a	production	WSGI	server	instead.  *	Debug	mode:	on *	Running	on	http:  0.0.0.0:5000 	 Press	CTRL+C	to	quit  *	Restarting	with	stat *	Debugger	is	active! *	Debugger	PIN:	179-281-442  Now,	you	can	see	the	internal	server	running.	Like	we	used	PHP,	the	same	is applied	to	Python,	and	then	you	can	get	your	IP	address.	Access	from	your	web browser	and	you	must	see	a	page	like	that	the	one	following:   Figure	4.3  learn	 more	 about	  As	the	log	from	the	Flask	says	by	itself,	this	server	is	just	for	the	development purposes.	We	must	use	a	WSGI	 Web	Server	Gateway	Interface .	If	you	want to	 the	 PEP	 333	 page: https:  www.python.org dev peps pep-0333 .	 It	 explains	 more	 details	 about that	topic,	but	for	now,	our	focus	is	to	deploy	the	application. The	WSGI	server	that	we	will	use	will	be	Gunicorn.	It	is	just	one	of	the	many options	that	are	available.	To	install	it,	run	the	following	command:  that,	 you	 can	 access	  Now,	 we	 can	 deploy	 the	 application	 again,	 but	 using	 the	 WSGI	 server.	 To	 do this,	run	the	following	command: root@devops:~	gunicorn	--chdir	 root 	app:app	-b	"0.0.0.0" [2020-03-23	18:34:13	+0000]	[23783]	[INFO]	Starting	gunicorn	20.0.4 [2020-03-23	18:34:13	+0000]	[23783]	[INFO]	Listening	at: http:  0.0.0.0:8000	 23783  [2020-03-23	18:34:13	+0000]	[23783]	[INFO]	Using	worker:	sync [2020-03-23	18:34:13	+0000]	[23786]	[INFO]	Booting	worker	with	pid: 23786 Notice	that	the	port	has	changed.	Now,	you	must	use	the	port	8000:   Figure	4.4  It’s	so	simple	like	that.	However,	we	also	want	to	run	this	application	behind	a reverse	proxy.	So,	let's	see	how	we	are	going	to	configure	that.  Configuring	the	Reverse	Proxy We	have	already	installed	Nginx	in	our	VM	and	we	also	know	the	configuration files.	Knowing	that,	the	configuration	for	the	pages	can	be	found	in	the	virtual hosts	which	are	found	in	the	directory: root@devops:~	ls	 etc nginx sites-available default  etc nginx sites-available default Then,	we	can	open	the	file	and	your	file	should	have	the	content	as	follows: server	{  listen	80	default_server; listen	[::]:80	default_server;  server_name	_;  location	 	{  }  proxy_pass	http:  localhost:8000 	;  } Restart	the	server	to	enable	the	configuration: root@devops:~	systemctl	restart	nginx root@devops:~ If	 you	 try	 to	 access	 the	 server	 using	 the	 default	 port	 80,	 you	 will	 see	 the following	message:   Figure	4.5  It	happens	because	the	server	behind	our	proxy	is	not	running	yet.	So,	let's	run	it and	check	the	changes: root@devops:~	gunicorn	--chdir	 root 	app:app [2020-03-23	18:52:26	+0000]	[24025]	[INFO]	Starting	gunicorn	20.0.4 [2020-03-23	18:52:26	+0000]	[24025]	[INFO]	Listening	at: http:  127.0.0.1:8000	 24025  [2020-03-23	18:52:26	+0000]	[24025]	[INFO]	Using	worker:	sync [2020-03-23	18:52:26	+0000]	[24028]	[INFO]	Booting	worker	with	pid: 24028 This	time	we	do	not	need	to	pass	the	bind	option,	-b	to	make	the	server	available to	 all	 the	 IP	 address.	 In	 the	 current	 case,	 the	 server	 is	 just	 listening	 to	 the localhost.	Therefore,	Nginx	is	open	to	the	world	receiving	the	connections	and forwarding	it	to	Gunicorn. If	you	try	to	access	again	using	the	default	port,	you	will	see	that	now	we	are able	to	see	the	service	run:  Figure	4.6  The	environment	is	ready.	Reverse	proxies	are	used	for	many	strategies.	One	of the	most	common	is	caching	the	static	files,	like	JavaScript,	CSS,	and	HTML. Therefore,	 all	 the	 incoming	 connections	 are	 responded	 by	 Nginx	 and	 only	 the dynamic	content	is	forwarded	to	Gunicorn.	This	way	is	less	costly	for	the	CPU to	process	everything.	In	the	future	chapters,	we	will	see	how	to	apply	the	same logic,	but	using	the	Cloud	services,	which	are	the	most	common	today.	But,	if   you	are	using	on-premises	infrastructure,	this	can	be	a	good	strategy	to	increase the	performance.   CHAPTER	5 Deploying	Your	Application	Using Docker  T  server.  his	chapter	aims	to	explain	how	to	install	Docker,	how	to	work	using	it, create	 new	 containers,	 images,	 networks,	 and	 deploy	 the	 image	 inside	 a  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  Introduction	to	Docker Installing	Docker	and	creating	containers Creating	images	using	Dockerfile Publishing	images	and	deploying	it  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Understand	what	is	Docker	and	how	it	works Setup	a	Docker	environment Create	containers	and	images Version	images	and	deploying  Introduction	to	Docker Docker	is	a	tool	set	to	create	containers	and	version	it.	For	those	who	have	more experience	with	Linux,	they	probably	already	know	what	a	container	is	by	using the	 command	 chroot	 on	 Linux.	 In	 simple	 words,	 a	 container	 is	 a	 directory	 in your	file	system	that	allows	you	to	install	another	Linux	operating	system	in	it. As	the	command	says	chroot	 change	root ,	so	the	new	root	directory	 ,	will	be   the	new	one	that	you	set.	However,	an	entire	operating	system	needs	so	much more	than	just	the	files.	Then,	for	the	networking	part,	the	Docker	uses	iptables under	the	hood.	To	manage	some	redirects	via	NAT	rules,	I	will	show	you	the amount	of	stuff	that	Docker	manages	for	you	by	running	some	simple	commands in	the	following	paragraphs.  Installation Firstly,	 we	 need	 to	 install	 Docker	 in	 our	 environment.	 In	 the	 official documentation,	you	will	find	all	the	steps	and	the	detailed	instructions.	Here,	we have	a	summary	of	everything:  apt	clean apt-get	update apt-get	remove	docker	docker-engine	docker.io	containerd	runc	-y The	 preceding	 commands	 will	 remove	 any	 previous	 installation	 of	 Docker,	 if you	had	one	in	your	machine:  apt-get	install	apt-transport-https	ca-certificates	curl	gnupg- agent	software-properties-common	-y Now,	we	are	just	installing	some	dependencies	that	are	required	for	your	Docker installation,	like	the	apt-transport-https,	which	is	a	requirement	to	download packages	from	the	https	repositories:  curl	-fsSL	https:  download.docker.com linux ubuntu gpg		apt-key add	- The	 following	 command	 will	 add	 GNU	 Privacy	 Guard	 key	 to	 ensure	 the authenticity	of	the	Docker	repository:  add-apt-repository	"deb	[arch=amd64] https:  download.docker.com linux ubuntu	$ lsb_release	-cs 	stable" We	 are	 using	 Ubuntu.	 So,	 the	 preceding	 command	 is	 specifically	 for	 Ubuntu environments:  apt-get	update	-y apt-get	install	docker-ce	docker-ce-cli	containerd.io	-y To	conclude,	the	previous	command	were	to	update	your	local	repositories	list and	install	the	Docker	Community	Edition.   Creating	Containers The	environment	is	ready.	To	ensure	that	your	Docker	is	running	fine,	run	the following	command: root@devops:~	systemctl	status	docker  docker.service	-	Docker	Application	Container	Engine Loaded:	loaded	  lib systemd system docker.service;	enabled; vendor	preset:	enabled  Active:	active	 running 	since	Thu	2020-04-02	10:28:47	UTC;	1min 7s	ago Docs:	https:  docs.docker.com  Main	PID:	6464	 dockerd   Tasks:	9  CGroup:	 system.slice docker.service  └─6464	 usr bin dockerd	-H	fd:  	-- containerd= run containerd containerd.sock  Now,	 your	 Docker	 installation	 is	 active	 and	 running.	 To	 create	 one	 container, you	can	just	type	the	following	command: root@devops:~	docker	run	-ti	centos	 bin bash Unable	to	find	image	'centos:latest'	locally latest:	Pulling	from	library centos 8a29a15cefae:	Downloading [=================================================>] 72.58MB 73.23MB The	previous	command	means	that	we	need	to	run	a	new	container	with	a	TTY  terminal ,	 which	 is	 represented	 by	 the	 parameter	 -t,	 and	 an	 interactive, represented	 by	 the	 parameter	 -i.	 Thus,	 we	 can	 run	 the	 commands	 in	 the container	terminal	and	see	their	outputs. When	your	container	is	created,	you	can	see	the	following	output: root@devops:~	docker	run	-ti	centos	 bin bash Unable	to	find	image	'centos:latest'	locally latest:	Pulling	from	library centos 8a29a15cefae:	Pull	complete  Digest: sha256:fe8d824220415eed5477b63addf40fb06c3b049404242b31982106ac204f6700  Status:	Downloaded	newer	image	for	centos:latest [root@595b42fceebc	 ] The	last	line	is	the	important	one: [root@595b42fceebc	 ]   If	you	compare	with	our	terminal	in	before	running	the	command:  root@devops:~	docker	run	-ti	centos	 bin bash You	 can	 clearly	 see	 that	 the	 hostname	 is	 changed,	 which	 means	 now	 we	 are within	the	container	and	all	the	commands	we	will	run,	starting	from	now,	will be	 running	 inside	 the	 container,	 and	 nothing	 will	 be	 installed	 in	 the	 VM environment.	 The	 hostname	 name	 given	 to	 the	 container	 595b42fceebc	 is	 the container	 ID,	 which	 is	 used	 to	 manage	 your	 container.	 To	 exit	 from	 your container,	type:	exit	or	Ctrl	+	D: [root@595b42fceebc	 ] exit root@devops:~ To	see	your	current	running	containers,	type	the	following	command:  We	can	see	zero	containers	running.	It	happens	because	once	you	type	exit	or Ctrl	+	D	from	your	container	terminal,	the	container	stops.	To	see	that,	type	the following	command:  Now,	you	can	see	your	container	created.	If	you	give	a	look,	you	can	see	that	the value	in	the	column	CONTAINER	ID	is	exactly	the	same	as	the	container	hostname when	we	created	it. However,	why	does	the	Docker	has	this	behavior?	Why	is	it	that	when	we	exit from	 a	 container,	 the	 container	 stops?	 This	 happens	 because	 in	 the	 containers concept,	 one	 container	 is	 created	 for	 one	 specific	 purpose,	 different	 from	 the virtual	machines.	So,	we	do	not	need	to	concern	about	uptime	or	maintaining	a container.	 You	 can	 just	 delete	 it	 and	 create	 a	 new	 one.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 make changes	into	a	container,	you	must	modify	the	image,	save	it,	delete	the	current container,	and	start	a	new	one	with	the	new	version	of	the	image. In	my	case,	I	created	a	container	based	on	a	CentOS	image,	and	I	just	ran	the command	  bin bash,	 which	 was	 keeping	 my	 container	 alive.	 Once	 that   command	 stops	 running,	 the	 container	 becomes	 dead.	 It	 also	 applies	 for	 the container	 configurations.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 change	 a	 redirect	 or	 any	 other parameters,	you	must	create	a	new	container	with	those	new	parameters,	save	it, and	run	a	new	container. Now,	we	will	create	a	new	container	based	in	the	CentOS	image,	and	within	this container,	we	will	put	a	Python	application	that	we	learned	in	the	last	chapter: root@devops:~	docker	run	-ti	--name	python_app	-p	5000:5000	centos  bin bash [root@ce7f74b0304a	 ] The	creation	now	was	clearly	faster	than	the	first	one.	This	happens	because	the CentOS	image	is	already	in	our	local	repository.	Therefore,	the	Docker	does	not need	to	download	it	again. Install	the	dependencies	in	the	container	with	the	following	command: [root@ce7f74b0304a	 ]	yum	clean	all	&&	yum	install	python3 python3-pip	-y Failed	to	set	locale,	defaulting	to	C.UTF-8 0	files	removed Failed	to	set	locale,	defaulting	to	C.UTF-8 CentOS-8	-	AppStream	11%	[=======]	122	kB s		767	kB	00:49	ETA While	 the	 download	 is	 running,	 we	 have	 a	 new	 command	 now,	 the	 yum.	 This command	 is	 respective	 to	 APT	 on	 Ubuntu,	 and	 you	 can	 use	 it	 to	 install	 the packages	from	remote	repositories. After	the	download	finishes,	install	the	Python	modules	for	the	application: [root@ce7f74b0304a	 ]	python3	-m	pip	install	flask Successfully	installed	Jinja2-2.11.1	MarkupSafe-1.1.1	Werkzeug- 1.0.1	click-7.1.1	flask-1.1.1	itsdangerous-1.1.0 Copy	the	source	code	used	in	the	previous	chapter	to	the	container: [root@ce7f74b0304a	 ]	cat	 	 srv app.py >	from	flask	import	Flask > >	app	=	Flask __name__  > >	@app.route " "  >	def	index  : >	return	"DevOps	with	Linux" > > >	if	__name__	==	"__main__":   >	app.run debug=True,host="0.0.0.0"  >	EOF Run	the	application	to	see	if	it	is	working: [root@ce7f74b0304a	 ]	python3	 srv app.py *	Serving	Flask	app	"app"	 lazy	loading  *	Environment:	production WARNING:	This	is	a	development	server.

We	just	created	a	version	of CentOS	with	Python3	installed,	and	an	application	inside	it.	If	you	want	to	create a	 new	 version	 of	 your	 application,	 or	 update	 the	 CentoOS	 version,	 or	 even change	the	underlying	OS,	like	migrating	from	CentOS	to	Alpine,	you	can	do that.	Do	all	the	tests,	create	a	new	version	of	the	image	with	the	same	name,	send it	 to	 the	 hub,	 and	 download	 it	 in	 to	 your	 production quality development   environment.  Creating	Images	with	Dockerfile Now	that	you	already	know	all	the	steps	of	how	to	create	an	image	and	how	to push	it	into	the	hub,	we	can	automate	these	steps	using	the	Dockerfile.	This	file helps	you	to	track	the	modifications	made	into	an	image.	When	you	just	create	a container,	 install	 everything	 and	 create	 an	 image.	 It	 is	 a	 difficult	 task	 to	 track everything	that	was	installed.	Therefore,	if	you	want	to	create	a	new	version	for the	same	application,	you	have	to	track	all	the	dependencies	and	everything,	to ensure	that	all	the	earlier	dependencies	are	still	present	in	the	new	image. Now,	create	a	file,	called	Dockerfile,	and	we	will	include	all	the	steps	running	in the	container	within	the	file: root@devops:~	vim	Dockerfile from	centos maintainer	alisson.copyleft@gmail.com  run	yum	clean	all run	yum	install	python3	python3-pip	-y run	python3	-m	pip	install	flask copy	app.py	 srv app.py expose	5000  cmd	["python3"," srv app.py"] Earlier,	you	have	the	file	content,	which	has	exactly	all	the	commands	that	we ran	within	the	container.	The	statements	are	self-explained,	thus,	you	can	use:  from,	to	specify	the	base	image. maintainer,	to	specify	who	is	maintaining	the	image. run,	will	execute	the	commands	within	the	container. copy,	copy	one	file	from	the	local	machine	to	the	container. expose,	publishes	the	container	port. cmd,	the	command	which	will	ensure	the	container	running.  To	create	the	image	based	on	Dockerfile,	run	the	following	command: root@devops:~	docker	build	.	-t	my_new_image Sending	build	context	to	Docker	daemon	735.7kB Step	1 8	:	from	centos latest:	Pulling	from	library centos 8a29a15cefae:	Pulling	fs	layer   The	 Docker	 build	 will	 look	 for	 a	 Dockerfile	 inside	 the	 current	 directory.	 The parameter	 -t	 means	 TAG,	 which	 will	 define	 the	 image	 name.	 So,	 after	 the command	finishes,	you	can	just	create	a	new	container	by	running	the	following command: Successfully	built	b1b23966bb89 Successfully	tagged	my_new_image:latest root@devops:~	docker	run	my_new_image *	Serving	Flask	app	"app"	 lazy	loading  *	Environment:	production WARNING:	This	is	a	development	server.

The	 Dockerfile basically	did	the	same	steps	for	us	before	it	created	a	new	container.	If	you	check the	output,	you	will	see	the	following:  Successfully	built	b1b23966bb89 This	is	the	container	ID,	and	in	the	end	the	container	was	tagged	with	the	name specified	in	the	Docker	build:  Successfully	tagged	my_new_image:latest You	can	directly	put	the	repository	name	and	push	it	there.	Now,	you	already know	the	basics	of	Docker	and	it	is	the	minimum	requirement	for	you	start	to Dockerize	your	applications.  Conclusion To	conclude,	we	could	see	that	working	with	Docker	is	an	easy	task.	We	just have	to	apply	our	previous	knowledge	in	a	different	area	of	work.	Then,	you	can create	a	version	of	your	environment,	including	Infrastructure	as	Code,	ship	it	to everywhere	 you	 want	 to,	 but	 Docker,	 in	 itself,	 is	 not	 enough	 for	 the	 large production	 environments.	 For	 that,	 we	 have	 a	 chapter	 about	 Kubernetes	 and Docker	is	a	requirement	for	us	to	work	with	it.   CHAPTER	6 Automating	Your	Infrastructure	as Code  T  his	chapter	aims	to	explain	how	the	Infrastructure	as	Code	works,	install Vagrant,	 how	 to	 work	 using	 it,	 create	 new	 virtual	 machines	 in	 an automated	way	using	the	Shell	Script,	and	set	up	all	Infrastructure	we	did	before.  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  Introduction	to	Infrastructure	as	Code Installing	Vagrant	and	creating	virtual	machines Setting	up	a	LAMP	server Setting	up	a	Docker	server  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  What	is	Vagrant	and	how	it	works Setup	a	Docker	environment	using	Vagrant	automation Setting	up	an	Apache	server Benefits	of	automation  Introduction	to	Infrastructure	as	Code Infrastructure	 as	 Code	 is	 a	 technique	 used	 to	 document,	 version,	 and	 maintain the	control	of	your	infrastructure	in	a	very	similar	way	as	you	do	with	software development.	 Then,	 you	 can	 create	 a	 file	 describing	 the	 desired	 state	 of	 your infrastructure,	deploy	it	on	a	test	environment,	validate	your	code,	deploy	on	a staging	 environment,	 and	 if	 everything	 goes	 well,	 you	 can	 proceed	 to	 the   production	environment.	It	is	possible	using	pipelines;	therefore,	you	can	use	the same	 code	 for	 all	 the	 environment	 and	 change	 the	 server's	 sizes	 using	 the variables	defined	for	each	of	the	environments.  What	is	Vagrant	and	How	It	Works? In	 the	 beginning	 of	 this	 book,	 you	 will	 learn	 how	 to	 setup	 the	 VirtualBox, download	 an	 ISO,	 create	 a	 VM,	 attach	 the	 ISO,	 and	 format	 and	 install	 the operating	system.	However,	it	is	a	recurrent	task	in	the	daily	life	of	a	DevOps engineer.	 Can	 you	 imagine	 yourself	 installing	 100	 VMs	 every	 day	 and destroying	them	after	the	working	day	to	save	money?	It	is	insane.	But,	when	we use	Infrastructure	as	Code	 IaC ,	this	task	becomes	very	easy	to	do,	because	you just	 need	 to	 do	 some	 clicks,	 and	 run	 some	 commands	 to	 create	 and	 destroy everything. Vagrant	is	a	tool	that	can	be	integrated	with	the	Virtual	Box.	It	is	responsible	to read	 your	 code,	 convert	 it	 into	 Virtual	 Box	 commands,	 and	 also	 run	 the	 code within	 the	 VM.	 You	 need	 not	 to	 execute	 all	 those	 steps	 learned	 in	 the	 first chapter.	 HashiCorp	 created	 Vagrant	 and	 they	 have	 an	 official	 repository	 of images	that	you	can	use	to	setup	your	environment.	So,	you	do	not	need	to	go	to the	official	website,	download	the	ISO,	and	setup	the	machine.  Vagrant	installing You	can	download	Vagrant	from	the	following	link: https:  www.vagrantup.com downloads.html I	am	using	Windows,	so	I	will	download	the	MSI	version.   Figure	6.1  The	 installation	 process	 is	 simple	 like	 any	 other	 software	 to	 be	 installed	 on Windows.	 You	 just	 need	 to	 open	 the	 MSI	 file	 and	 follow	 the	 process,	 Next, Next:   And	then,	click	Finish	with	all	the	default	options:  Figure	6.2   Now,	since	the	installation	is	completed,	let	us	learn	the	basics.  Figure	6.3  Usage Firstly,	create	a	folder	to	store	your	vagrant	files	as	I	did:   I	created	a	folder,	called	VagrantChaper	and	I	entered	that	folder.	Right	now,	it is	empty.	To	create	your	first	code,	type	the	following	command:  PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	init A	'Vagrantfile'	has	been	placed	in	this	directory.	You	are	now ready	to	'vagrant	up'	your	first	virtual	environment!	Please	read the	comments	in	the	Vagrantfile	as	well	as	documentation	on 'vagrantup.com'	for	more	information	on	using	Vagrant. PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter> The	 command	 vagrant	 init,	 creates	 a	 sample	 file	 for	 you	 with	 the	 common configuration	 for	 the	 most	 of	 the	 cases	 of	 VMs.	 Let's	 have	 a	 look	 in	 the	 file content: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	cat	.\Vagrantfile 	-*-	mode:	ruby	-*- 	vi:	set	ft=ruby	:  	All	Vagrant	configuration	is	done	below.	The	"2"	in Vagrant.configure 	configures	the	configuration	version	 we	support	older	styles	for 	backwards	compatibility .	Please	don't	change	it	unless	you	know what 	you're	doing. Vagrant.configure "2" 	do	config  	The	most	common	configuration	options	are	documented	and commented	below. 	For	a	complete	reference,	please	see	the	online	documentation	at 	https:  docs.vagrantup.com.  	Every	Vagrant	development	environment	requires	a	box.	You	can search	for 	boxes	at	https:  vagrantcloud.com search. config.vm.box	=	"base"  	Disable	automatic	box	update	checking.	If	you	disable	this,	then   	boxes	will	only	be	checked	for	updates	when	the	user	runs 	'vagrant	box	outdated'.	This	is	not	recommended. 	config.vm.box_check_update	=	false  	Create	a	forwarded	port	mapping	which	allows	access	to	a specific	port 	within	the	machine	from	a	port	on	the	host	machine.	In	the example	below, 	accessing	"localhost:8080"	will	access	port	80	on	the	guest machine. 	NOTE:	This	will	enable	public	access	to	the	opened	port 	config.vm.network	"forwarded_port",	guest:	80,	host:	8080  	Create	a	forwarded	port	mapping	which	allows	access	to	a specific	port 	within	the	machine	from	a	port	on	the	host	machine	and	only allow	access 	via	127.0.0.1	to	disable	public	access 	config.vm.network	"forwarded_port",	guest:	80,	host:	8080, host_ip:	"127.0.0.1"  	Create	a	private	network,	which	allows	host-only	access	to	the machine 	using	a	specific	IP. 	config.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.10"  	Create	a	public	network,	which	generally	matched	to	bridged network. 	Bridged	networks	make	the	machine	appear	as	another	physical device	on 	your	network. 	config.vm.network	"public_network"  	Share	an	additional	folder	to	the	guest	VM.	The	first	argument is 	the	path	on	the	host	to	the	actual	folder.	The	second	argument is 	the	path	on	the	guest	to	mount	the	folder.	And	the	optional third 	argument	is	a	set	of	non-required	options. 	config.vm.synced_folder	".. data",	" vagrant_data"  	Provider-specific	configuration	so	you	can	fine-tune	various 	backing	providers	for	Vagrant.

Enable	provisioning	with	a	shell	script.	Additional	provisioners such	as 	Ansible,	Chef,	Docker,	Puppet	and	Salt	are	also	available. Please	see	the 	documentation	for	more	information	about	their	specific	syntax and	use. 	config.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL 	apt-get	update 	apt-get	install	-y	apache2 	SHELL  end In	the	same	folder,	you	run	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	status Current	machine	states: default	not	created	 virtualbox  It	means	that	we	have	one	VM,	called	default,	and	it	is	not	created	yet.	So,	we will	create	one. The	 sample	 file	 has	 some	 configurations	 and	 many	 comments	 giving	 a	 brief explanation	of	what	the	commands	do.	This	file,	with	the	default	configuration, allows	 you	 to	 create	 just	 one	 VM.	 In	 this	 chapter,	 we	 will	 create	 two	 virtual machines,	 one	 with	 the	 LAMP	 server	 installed,	 and	 other	 with	 the	 Docker installed.	I	will	modify	that	file	and	explain	the	differences	between	the	example file	and	the	new	one: 	-*-	mode:	ruby	-*- 	vi:	set	ft=ruby	: Vagrant.configure "2" 	do	config config.vm.box	=	"ubuntu focal64" config.vm.box_check_update	=	false config.vm.provider	"virtualbox"	do	vb  vb.memory	=	"1024"  end  config.vm.define	"lamp"	do	lamp  lamp.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.10"   lamp.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  config.vm.define	"docker"	do	docker  docker.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.11" docker.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  apt-get	clean apt	update	-y  SHELL  end  apt-get	clean apt	update	-y  SHELL  end  apt-get	clean apt	update	-y  SHELL  config.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  End The	preceding	file	is	my	new	and	modified	one.	It	is	cleaner	than	the	example one,	and	does	more	stuff.	Let's	run	the	vagrant	status,	to	see	if	something	has changed: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	status Current	machine	states:  lamp						not	created	 virtualbox  docker				not	created	 virtualbox  Interestingly,	now	we	have	two	virtual	machines,	one	is	called	a	lamp,	and	the other	is	called	Docker.	Both	are	not	created	yet.	In	the	new	file,	I	used	a	Vagrant resource	called	multi-machine.	 It	allows	 you	to	 create	more	 than	one	 machine per	file.	So,	you	can	have	as	many	machines	as	you	want	in	the	same	file. Now,	let's	analyze	the	file	and	what	will	happen	before	we	create	the	VMs: config.vm.box	=	"ubuntu focal64"  config.vm.box_check_update	=	false config.vm.provider	"virtualbox"	do	vb  vb.memory	=	"1024"  end  This	 part	 with	 config.vm	 is	 the	 common	 configuration	 for	 all	 the	 virtual machines	declared	in	the	file.	So,	all	the	machines	will	be	created	with	1024	MB of	RAM.	The	config.vm.box	is	the	image	which	will	be	used	in	the	machine.	In our	case,	we	will	use	the	Ubuntu	server,	version	20.04:   config.vm.define	"lamp"	do	lamp  lamp.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.10" lamp.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  apt-get	clean apt	update	-y  SHELL  end In	 this	 part,	 we	 have	 a	 local	 configuration	 just	 for	 the	 machine	 lamp.	 It	 is specifically	 for	 the	 virtual	 machine,	 called	 lamp.	 Then,	 in	 this	 called,	 the	 VM will	have	the	IP	address	192.168.33.10,	and	the	command	which	will	be	run	in the	 provision	 of	 the	 VM,	 as	 in,	 inside	 this	 part:	 lamp.vm.provision.	 It	 also applies	to	the	Docker	VM: config.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  apt-get	clean apt	update	-y SHELL  In	the	final	part,	we	have	the	config.vm.provision.	Inside	this	block,	you	can define	the	command	which	will	run	in	all	the	VMs,	except	lamp.vm.provision, which	will	run	only	in	the	lamp	VM,	and	docker.vm.provision,	which	will	run only	in	the	Docker	VM.	Therefore,	we	have	global	configurations	that	will	run in	all	VMs	and	local	configurations	that	will	run	only	in	the	specified	VMs.  Up	and	running With	 the	 file	 explained	 and	 everything	 configures	 to	 create	 the	 VMs,	 type	 the following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	up	-- provider=virtualbox Bringing	machine	'lamp'	up	with	'virtualbox'	provider… Bringing	machine	'docker'	up	with	'virtualbox'	provider… ==>	lamp:	Box	'ubuntu focal64'	could	not	be	found.

Vagrant	 Cloud	  http:  vagrantcloud.com  	 to download	the	images.	But,	of	course,	is	not	the	only	one.	You	can	also	create your	images	using	Packer	 https:  packer.io  .	However,	if	you	don’t,	you	can search	there	what	images	are	available	for	you	to	create	your	VMs.  the	 official	 repository	  is	  Figure	6.4  After	 the	 provision,	 if	 you	 want	 to	 check	 your	 local	 boxes,	 use	 the	 following command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	box	list centos 7														 virtualbox,	1801.02  fedora 28-cloud-base		 virtualbox,	20180425  ubuntu bionic64							 virtualbox,	20190807.0.0  ubuntu focal64								 virtualbox,	20200409.0.0  ubuntu xenial64							 virtualbox,	20180413.0.0 Status:	Downloaded newer	image	for If	you	have	a	fresh	installation,	you	probably	have	only	the	Ubuntu focal64,	the one	we	downloaded: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	status   Current	machine	states:  lamp					running	 virtualbox  docker			running	 virtualbox  If	everything	went	well	with	your	provision,	run	the	command	vagrant	status and	it	will	show	you	the	running	VMs.	If	there	is	a	machine	that	is	not	created yet,	you	can	try	to	run	the	vagrant	up	–provider=virtualbox	again,	and	see	if it	works.	If	it	doesn’t,	check	your	installation	and	your	internet	connection. Suppose,	you	did	not	define	any	password	or	SSH	key	to	connect	to	these	VMs, then,	how	do	we	connect	to	them?	Vagrant	is	also	managing	that	for	us.	With	the vagrant	 status,	 we	 can	 see	 the	 names	 of	 the	 VMs	 and	 use	 these	 names	 to connect	using	the	command,	vagrant	ssh: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	ssh	docker Welcome	to	Ubuntu	Focal	Fossa	 development	branch 	 GNU Linux 5.4.0-21-generic	x86_64   *	Documentation:		https:  help.ubuntu.com *	Management:					https:  landscape.canonical.com *	Support:								https:  ubuntu.com advantage  The	VM	was	successfully	provisioned,	and	as	you	can	see	with	the	Ubuntu	Focal Fossa	 version,	 Vagrant	 also	 created	 as	 user,	 called	 vagrant,	 to	 connect	 to	 the VMs,	which	has	pseudo	permission.	So,	we	can	just	change	the	user	and	run	all the	commands: vagrant@ubuntu-focal:~$	sudo	su	- root@ubuntu-focal:~ Now,	you	can	manage	everything	as	we	did	in	the	previous	chapters.	But,	let's see	how	we	can	provision	a	LAMP	in	an	automated	way.  Setting	up	a	LAMP	Server You	already	know	the	commands,	and	then,	we	can	basically	put	the	commands in	the	provision	section	of	vagrant	file	and	provision	the	VM	again: 	-*-	mode:	ruby	-*- 	vi:	set	ft=ruby	: Vagrant.configure "2" 	do	config config.vm.box	=	"ubuntu focal64" config.vm.box_check_update	=	false config.vm.provider	"virtualbox"	do	vb  vb.memory	=	"1024"   config.vm.define	"lamp"	do	lamp  lamp.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.10" lamp.vm.hostname	=	"lamp" lamp.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  sudo	apt-get	clean sudo	apt	update	-y sudo	apt	install	apache2	mysql-server	php7.4	-y  end  SHELL  end  config.vm.define	"docker"	do	docker  docker.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.11" docker.vm.hostname	=	"docker" docker.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  apt-get	clean apt	update	-y  SHELL  end  apt-get	clean apt	update	-y  SHELL  config.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  end In	 this	 case,	 I	 changed	 the	 lamp.vm.provision,	 including	 the	 Shell	 Script	 to install	 PHP,	 Apache,	 and	 MySQL	 server.	 Once	 the	 VM	 is	 created,	 run	 the following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	provision	lamp ==>	lamp:	Running	provisioner:	shell…  lamp:	Running:	inline	script lamp: lamp:	WARNING:	apt	does	not	have	a	stable	CLI	interface.

After	the	installation finishes,	you	can	login	into	the	VM: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>vagrant	ssh	lamp   Welcome	to	Ubuntu	Focal	Fossa	 development	branch 	 GNU Linux 5.4.0-21-generic	x86_64  Check	the	services	running:  Check	the	IP	address,	the	one	defined	in	the	Vagrant	file: vagrant@lamp:~$	ip	a 3:	enp0s8:	 	mtu	1500	qdisc fq_codel	state	UP	group	default	qlen	1000  link ether	08:00:27:69:a5:81	brd	ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet	192.168.33.10 24	brd	192.168.33.255	scope	global	enp0s8  valid_lft	forever	preferred_lft	forever  You	can	check	the	IP	address	in	the	browser	and	see	Apache	running:   Figure	6.5  Now,	every	time	you	want	to	provision	a	new	LAMP	server,	you	can	directly copy	the	code,	or	include	a	new	VM	with	the	provision	code	and	it	will	work.  Setting	up	the	Docker	Server This	 process	 is	 not	 different	 from	 the	 first	 one.	 So,	 let's	 edit	 the	 Vagrant	 file again: 	-*-	mode:	ruby	-*- 	vi:	set	ft=ruby	: Vagrant.configure "2" 	do	config config.vm.box	=	"ubuntu bionic64" config.vm.box_check_update	=	false config.vm.provider	"virtualbox"	do	vb  vb.memory	=	"1024"  end  config.vm.define	"lamp"	do	lamp  lamp.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.10" lamp.vm.hostname	=	"lamp" lamp.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  sudo	apt-get	clean sudo	apt	update	-y sudo	apt	install	apache2	mysql-server	php7.4	-y  SHELL  end  config.vm.define	"docker"	do	docker  docker.vm.box	=	"ubuntu bionic64" docker.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.11" docker.vm.hostname	=	"docker"   docker.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  apt	clean apt-get	update apt-get	remove	docker	docker-engine	docker.io	containerd	runc	- y apt-get	install	apt-transport-https	ca-certificates	curl	gnupg- agent	software-properties-common	-y curl	-fsSL	https:  download.docker.com linux ubuntu gpg		apt- key	add	- add-apt-repository	"deb	[arch=amd64] https:  download.docker.com linux ubuntu	$ lsb_release	-cs  stable" apt-get	update	-y apt-get	install	docker-ce	docker-ce-cli	containerd.io	-y  config.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  SHELL  end  apt-get	clean apt	update	-y  SHELL  end Note	that	I	changed	the	box	just	for	the	Docker	VM	because,	in	the	Docker	repo, the	support	for	Focal	Fosse	was	not	available	yet.	But	it	is	also	interesting	to	see how	we	can	create	different	VMs	with	different	OS	versions. Now,	within	the	provision	part	of	the	Docker	VM,	we	have	all	the	installation steps	to	setup	the	server.	Then,	you	can	start	the	machine	again: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\VagrantChapter>	vagrant	up	docker Bringing	machine	'docker'	up	with	'virtualbox'	provider… ==>	docker:	Importing	base	box	'ubuntu focal64'… ==>	docker:	Matching	MAC	address	for	NAT	networking… ==>	docker:	Setting	the	name	of	the	VM: VagrantChapter_docker_1586798805547_50415 ==>	docker:	Fixed	port	collision	for	22	=>	2222.

If	it	doesn’t,	or	if	you	want	to	run	the	script	again,	you can	 execute	 the	 command	 vagrant	 provision.	 Vagrant	 allows	 you	 to	 use different	 technologies,	 like	 Ansible,	 Puppet,	 or	 Chef	 to	 create	 your	 provision scripts.	 I	 used	 the	 Shell	 Script	 as	 an	 example,	 but,	 feel	 free	 to	 test	 and	 create your	own	scripts.	Another	important	thing	we	learned	is	the	Vagrant	file.	In	this file,	you	define	everything,	and	you	can	share	the	content	with	your	team,	so	that they	will	be	available	to	contribute	with	you	to	develop	your	environment.   CHAPTER	7 Creating	Your	Infrastructure	Using Cloud	Services  T  Infrastructure.  his	chapter	aims	to	introduce	you	to	the	biggest	Cloud	players	and	how	we can	use	it	to	speed	up	the	provisioning,	scalability,	and	reliability	of	our  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  Cloud	and	Main	Players Provisioning	using	AWS Provisioning	using	GCP Provisioning	using	Azure  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Define	Cloud	and	how	to	use	it Set	up	the	environment	on	each	player Create	a	simple	infrastructure	using	the	command	line Check	the	infrastructure	created	in	the	Cloud	console  Cloud	and	Main	Players Until	this	moment,	we	have	been	using	our	own	computer	to	create	everything. However,	running	the	applications	in	production	requires	a	lot	of	stuff,	such	as, high	 availability,	 backup,	 monitoring,	 redundancy,	 etc.	 In	 the	 past,	 many companies	 had	 their	 own	 data	 centers	 or	 local	 servers	 which	 were	 turned	 on 24*7.	Hence,	it	takes	a	lot	of	effort	to	manage	everything,	because	it	is	not	just   taking	care	of	the	virtual	machines	or	the	software;	it	is	necessary	to	manage	the network,	storage,	energy,	no	breaks,	internet	connection,	and	many	other	things that	are	involved	in	IT.	Also,	a	team	with	different	skills	to	manage	everything	is required	to	have	the	redundancy	of	people	as	well,	because,	if	some	employee	in the	company	gets	sick,	you	must	have	another	available,	in	case	something	stops working. When	I	began	working	in	the	IT	industry,	some	of	the	companies	that	I	worked for	 were	 using	 a	 service	 called	 Colocation,	 in	 which	 you	 can	 basically	 rent	 a Rack	inside	a	data	center,	and	you	can	install	your	servers.	Therefore,	you	just need	 to	 manage	 your	 servers.	 The	 networking,	 energy	 and	 internet	 part	 were delegated	to	the	company	which	was	offering	the	service.	After	sometime,	we began	to	use	the	services	from	a	company	called	SoftLayer.	They	had	their	own data	center	and	we	could	pay	and	use	a	physical	server	for	some	time	when	we were	renting	the	server. After	this	period,	we	started	working	with	the	AWS,	which	is	a	Cloud	company. There,	 we	 could	 rent	 the	 virtual	 machines,	 exactly	 like	 the	 VMs	 that	 we	 have been	 created	 in	 the	 earlier	 chapters.	 There	 are	 a	 lot	 of	 benefits	 of	 using	 this service,	such	as	high	availability.	So,	if	some	physical	server	fails	in	their	data center,	you	can	just	shut	down	the	VM	and	start	the	VM	in	another	server,	or even	pay	them	to	do	the	backup	for	you.	Thus,	only	one	person	can	manage	an entire	infrastructure	with	hundreds	of	servers.  AWS Amazon	Web	Services	is	currently	the	main	Cloud	player	at	the	moment.	They have	dozens	of	services	which	you	can	use	to	deploy	your	applications,	monitor, backup,	 create	 VMs,	 databases,	 queues,	 etc.	 It	 also	 allows	 you	 to	 create everything	 in	 an	 automated	 way	 using	 a	 command	 line,	 which	 is	 called AWSCLI.	But,	of	course,	it	is	not	that	easy	to	use	all	their	services.	That	is	why, they	 have	 created	 many	 courses	 and	 certifications,	 so	 that	 the	 people	 can	 get qualified	and	take	the	best	of	what	their	services	can	offer.  GCP Google	Cloud	Platform	is	the	newest	one.	They	are	offering	many	services	like AWS,	 but,	 they	 still	 do	 not	 have	 all	 the	 services	 as	 theirs.	 Nevertheless,	 they have	 some	 unique	 services,	 like	 Big	 Query,	 which	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 used	 to query	 large	 datasets	 and	 store	 the	 data	 on	 the	 Cloud.	 Furthermore,	 if	 you	 are   working	 with	 machine	 learning,	 they	 have	 clusters	 available	 to	 take	 the maximum	performance	with	TensorFlow	Projects.	GCP	is	often	cheaper	than	its other	big	competitors.	I	am	using	it	for	my	personal	projects.  Azure This	 is	 the	 Microsoft	 Cloud	 platform.	 So,	 if	 you	 are	 planning	 to	 export	 your active	 directory	 to	 the	 Cloud,	 this	 is	 the	 one.	 They	 have	 unique	 services,	 like SQL	 server,	 Azure	 Active	 Directory,	 or	 even	 the	 Azure	 DevOps	 which	 have become	very	famous.	Some	of	the	big	companies	that	I	worked	for	in	the	past used	Azure	as	their	main	platform,	because	Microsoft	is	a	reliable	company.	But, they	are	the	most	expensive	as	well.	So,	if	money	is	not	your	problem,	and	you are	using	Microsoft	products	in	your	applications,	this	is	the	right	option.  Provisioning	using	AWS AWS	has	its	own	courses	to	explain	how	to	use	all	the	services.	Then,	my	goal here	 is	 to	 show	 you	 how	 we	 can	 provide	 the	 same	 infrastructure	 like	 we	 did using	 the	 VirtualBox	 and	 Vagrant.	 So,	 I	 will	 focus	 on	 VMs	 and	 how	 we	 can install	things	on	it. Therefore,	your	first	task	is	to	create	your	own	AWS	Account.	You	can	visit	the following	link	to	do	so: http:  console.aws.amazon.com  After	you	have	created	your	account	and	logged	in	into	the	console,	you	will	see a	page	shown	in	the	following	figure:  This	 console	 allows	 you	 to	 create	 any	 service	 that	 you	 want.	 Now,	 click	 on Services	EC2	Running	Instances.	You	will	see	the	following	page:  Figure	7.1   Figure	7.2  My	account	is	empty.	I	have	used	more	AWS	in	the	past,	and	currently,	I	am using	 Azure	 in	 my	 current	 job,	 and	 am	 using	 GCP	 for	 personal	 projects. However,	this	is	the	console	for	you	to	manage	your	VMs.	It	is	important	for you	to	know	where	you	can	see	your	virtual	machines	in	the	console,	because	it is	 easier	 to	 see	 the	 watch	 you	 have.	 But	 starting	 from	 now,	 we	 will	 create everything	using	the	command	line.	So,	now,	install	Python	and	then	write	the following	AWS	command	line: https:  www.python.org downloads  After	Python	is	installed,	install	the	AWS	CLI	running	the	following	command line: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	python	-m	pip	install	awscli	--user Collecting	awscli To	 check	 if	 the	 AWS	 CLI	 was	 installed	 successfully,	 run	 the	 following command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	--version aws-cli 1.18.42	Python 3.8.2	Windows 10	botocore 1.15.42 Everything	is	working.	Now,	to	configure	the	access,	you	need	to	create	an	IAM account	 with	 the	 programmatic	 access.	 The	 easiest	 way	 is	 by	 clicking	 on Services	and	typing	IAM,	like	the	following	screenshot:   IAM	means	Identity	Access	Management.	This	service	is	responsible	to	create and	manage	users	and	groups.	In	the	dashboard,	click	on	Users	Add	User:  Figure	7.3  I	am	creating	a	new	user,	called	DevOps,	with	the	programmatic	access:  Figure	7.4   Figure	7.5  the	 option	 Attachexisting	 policies	 directly	 and	  Select	 the	 policy AdministratorAccess	 will	 appear.	 This	 policy	 will	 enable	 our	 user	 to	 do everything	 in	 our	 AWS	 account.	 This	 permission	 is	 not	 recommended	 for production	environments.	The	user	must	have	only	the	permission	required	for	a specific	purpose.  Figure	7.6  After	saving	your	user,	you	will	be	redirected	to	the	page	with	the	Access	Key and	the	Secret	Key.	Save	these	values	because	you	will	never	be	able	to	get	the Secret	Key	again.	The	only	way	is	creating	a	new	user.   Figure	7.7  After	following	these	steps,	we	can	configure	the	command	line	and	test	if	we are	able	to	connect	to	the	console.	The	first	task	is	to	add	our	keys	in	the	local environment: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	configure AWS	Access	Key	ID	[None]:	YOU_ACCESS_KEY AWS	Secret	Access	Key	[None]:	YOUR_SECRET_KEY Default	region	name	[None]:	eu-central-1 Default	output	format	[None]: In	the	region	name,	I	have	set	eu-central-1,	which	is	respective	to	Frankfurt, because	 I	 am	 living	 in	 Germany.	 Often,	 people	 set	 this	 option	 as	 us-east-1, which	is	respective	to	Virginia	in	the	USA.	So,	it	is	up	to	you. Now,	 you	 can	 check	 if	 you	 have	 any	 example,	 created	 using	 the	 following command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	describe-instances {  "Reservations":	[]  } I	do	not	have	any	example,	but	to	create	one	when	you're	using	the	console	is	an easy	 task.	 With	 just	 few	 clicks,	 you	 can	 create	 one.	 However,	 you	 cannot automate.	 To	 automate,	 you	 need	 to	 use	 the	 command	 line	 and	 for	 that,	 you should	know	every	single	object	necessary	for	your	VM. The	 first	 one	 is	 creating	 an	 SSH	 Key.	 It	 is	 required	 to	 access	 the	 VM	 after creating	it. PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	create-key-pair	--key-name   DevopsBook	--query'KeyMaterial'	--output	text					YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY The	parameter,--query	was	used	to	get	only	the	private	key	in	the	format	of	a plain	text.	Otherwise,	you	can	have	only	one	string,	which	creates	problems	with the	file	format	when	you	use	it. Copy	 the	 private	 key	 and	 save	 it	 into	 a	 file.	 In	 my	 case,	 I	 saved	 it	 as devopbook.pem,	which	is	the	standard	used	by	AWS. Every	instance	needs	an	IP	address.	Otherwise,	you	will	not	be	able	to	access	it remotely.	 But,	 to	 have	 an	 IP	 address,	 a	 subnet	 is	 required	 and	 in	 a	 sequence. Now,	let's	create	a	network	using	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	create-vpc	--cidr-block "192.168.0.0 24" {  "Vpc":	{  "CidrBlock":	"192.168.0.0 24", "DhcpOptionsId":	"dopt-891c21e2", "State":	"pending", "VpcId":	"vpc-0825b5c6f6a2a2429", "OwnerId":	"360560397478", "InstanceTenancy":	"default", "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet":	[], "CidrBlockAssociationSet":	[  {  }  "AssociationId":	"vpc-cidr-assoc-07b70a566b3a97801", "CidrBlock":	"192.168.0.0 24", "CidrBlockState":	{  "State":	"associated"  } ], "IsDefault":	false, "Tags":	[]  }  } Virtual	 Networks	 on	 AWS	 are	 called	 VPC	  Virtual	 Private	 Cloud .	 I	 had	 to specify	the	CIDR	block,	which	represents	the	network	size,	which	allows	us	to have	254	available	addresses.	Save	the	VpcId.	We	will	need	it	later	on. The	next	step	is	creating	a	subnet.	Use	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	create-subnet	--cidr-block "192.168.0.0 24"	--vpc-id	vpc-0825b5c6f6a2a2429 {  "Subnet":	{   "AvailabilityZone":	"eu-central-1a", "AvailabilityZoneId":	"euc1-az2", "AvailableIpAddressCount":	251, "CidrBlock":	"192.168.0.0 24", "DefaultForAz":	false, "MapPublicIpOnLaunch":	false, "State":	"pending", "SubnetId":	"subnet-0c7889e706674e64f", "VpcId":	"vpc-0825b5c6f6a2a2429", "OwnerId":	"360560397478", "AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation":	false, "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet":	[], "SubnetArn":	"arn:aws:ec2:eu-central- 1:360560397478:subnet subnet-0c7889e706674e64f"  }  } In	the	subnet	too,	I	used	the	same	CIDR	Block.	I	want	to	have	only	one	subnet	in my	VPC.	But,	you	can	create,	for	example,	a	VPC	with	a	bigger	block	like	 16 or	 8	and	split	it	into	many	subnets,	as	many	as	you	want. For	security	reasons,	we	are	obligated	to	create	security	groups.	It	is	like	firewall rules,	 which	 will	 allow	 the	 traffic	 to	 determine	 the	 IP	 address,	 networks,	 and block,	 or	 allow	 ports	 depending	 on	 the	 protocols.	 Therefore,	 let's	 create	 it because	it	is	a	requirement,	for	instance: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	create-security-group	--group-name devops-book	--description	"Example	used	in	the	book"	--vpc-id	vpc- 0825b5c6f6a2a2429 {  "GroupId":	"sg-0da7b308d99365dc3"  } Save	the	GroupId.	Now,	we	need	to	allow	all	the	TCP	connections	in	this	group: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	authorize-security-group-ingress	-- group-id	sg-0da7b308d99365dc3	--protocol	tcp	--port	22	--cidr 0.0.0.0 0 For	the	port	22,	the	access	can	be	given	from	any	source	and	we	can	assign	this SecurityGroup	 to	 any	 instance	 that	 we	 have.	 And	 finally,	 we	 can	 create	 an instance: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	run-instances	--count	1	--instance- type	t3.micro	--key-name	DevopsBook	--security-group-ids	sg- 0da7b308d99365dc3	--subnet-id	subnet-0c7889e706674e64f	--image-id ami-0b418580298265d5c   { "Groups":	[], "Instances":	[ The	new	parameter	here	is	the	Image	ID.	This	represents	an	ID	of	an	Amazon Machine	Image,	which	is	the	ISO	that	we	used	in	the	first	chapter	or	the	Box	we used	in	the	Vagrant	chapter.	To	see	the	image	options,	you	can	give	a	look	in	the Amazon	 Marketplace	 https:  aws.amazon.com marketplace.	 I	 am	 an	 Ubuntu fan,	so,	this	Image	ID	represents	an	Ubuntu	version	18.04. Check	if	your	instance	is	running	with	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	describe-instances	--query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].{Instance:InstanceId,State:State}" [  "Instance":	"i-0d26f9c327b92b630", "State":	{  "Code":	16, "Name":	"running"  ] If	we	have	an	instance	and	it	is	running,	we	are	able	to	connect.	Usually,	when we	create	an	instance	using	the	console,	a	public	DNS	is	assigned	to	it.	Check	if you	have	one	with	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	describe-instances	--query "Reservations[*].Instances[*]. {Instance:InstanceId,State:State,DNS:PublicDnsName}" [  "Instance":	"i-0d26f9c327b92b630", "State":	{  "Code":	16, "Name":	"running"  }, "DNS":	""  ] The	 instance	 does	 not	 have	 access	 to	 the	 internet.	 So,	 we	 need	 to	 create	 an  [  {  }  }  ]  [  {  }  ]   Internet	Gateway	for	that	using	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>aws	ec2	create-internet-gateway {  "InternetGateway":	{ "Attachments":	[], "InternetGatewayId":	"igw-05d94c382dd27185b", "Tags":	[]  }  } Now,	 we	 need	 to	 associate	 the	 Internet	 Gateway	 with	 the	 VPC,	 and	 all	 the instances	inside	the	same	VPC	will	have	access	to	the	internet. PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>aws	ec2	attach-internet-gateway	--internet- gateway-id	igw-05d94c382dd27185b	--vpc-id	vpc-0825b5c6f6a2a2429 Even	creating	the	Internet	Gateway	and	the	VPC,	it	is	required	to	create	a	default route.	Then,	all	the	connections,	by	default,	will	try	to	go	through	the	internet first.	You	can	check	the	route	tables	using	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>aws	ec2	describe-route-tables {  "RouteTables":	[  "Associations":	[  {  {  "Main":	true, "RouteTableAssociationId":	"rtbassoc-0388bce2f3bf06f9b", "RouteTableId":	"rtb-0ba4bf0ea11f024ee", "AssociationState":	{  "State":	"associated"  } ], "PropagatingVgws":	[], "RouteTableId":	"rtb-0ba4bf0ea11f024ee", "Routes":	[  }  {  "DestinationCidrBlock":	"192.168.0.0 24", "GatewayId":	"local", "Origin":	"CreateRouteTable", "State":	"active"  } ], "Tags":	[], "VpcId":	"vpc-0825b5c6f6a2a2429",   "OwnerId":	"360560397478"  },  }, The	route	with	the	ID	rtb-0ba4bf0ea11f024ee	is	associated	with	the	VPC	vpc- 0825b5c6f6a2a2429,	 which	 is	 the	 vpc	 that	 we	 created.	 Therefore,	 we	 need	 to assign	a	new	route	so	that	every	connection	with	the	destination	to	 0.0.0.0 0 will	 pass	 the	 ID	 igw- 05d94c382dd27185b. PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	create-route	--route-table-id	rtb- 0ba4bf0ea11f024ee	--destination-cidr-block	0.0.0.0 0	--gateway-id igw-05d94c382dd27185b  through	 our	 Internet	 Gateway,	 represented	 by	  {  "Return":	true  } Now,	you	can	create	a	public	IP	address,	and	see	if	we	can	connect	using	the following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	allocate-address {  "PublicIp":	"18.156.153.94", "AllocationId":	"eipalloc-04066542351eff3a4", "PublicIpv4Pool":	"amazon", "NetworkBorderGroup":	"eu-central-1", "Domain":	"vpc"  } Now,	we	have	the	public	IP	and	we	need	to	assign	it	with	the	instance: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>aws	ec2	associate-address	--allocation-id eipalloc-04066542351eff3a4	--instance-id	i-0d26f9c327b92b630 {  "AssociationId":	"eipassoc-07026da6c9093c86a"  } Let	us	check	the	instance	one	more	time: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	aws	ec2	describe-instances	--query "Reservations[*].Instances[*]. {Instance:InstanceId,State:State,DNS:PublicDnsName, IP:PublicIpAddress}" [  [  {  "Instance":	"i-0d26f9c327b92b630",   "State":	{  "Code":	16, "Name":	"running"  }, "DNS":	"", "IP":	"18.156.153.94"  }  ]  ] Now,	we	have	the	IP	address:	18.156.153.93assigned	with	the	instance.	We	still do	not	have	the	Public	DNS,	but,	we	can	try	to	connect	using	the	IP.	Remember the	Private	Key	that	you	saved	when	we	created	the	SSH?

We	need	to	automate	many	using	the	command	line,	like the	REST	APIs,	sometimes	SOAP	Interfaces.	It	does	not	matter	what	you	have to	automate,	just	do	it.   If	you	want	to	delete	everything,	you	can	access	the	web	interface	directly	and delete	the	VM.	All	the	resources	will	be	deleted	as	well.  Provisioning	using	GCP Now	 is	 the	 time	 to	 create	 the	 same	 infrastructure	 using	 the	 Google	 Cloud Platform.	The	elements	are	the	same	in	all	the	platforms.	We	will	need	networks, subnets,	SSH	keys,	public	IP	address,	etc.	However,	the	commands	and	the	way we	are	going	to	implement	it,	changes	by	the	platform.

To	  project	  access	  ready	  go	  to	  is	   Figure	7.8  On	 Google,	 the	 service	 name	 to	 create	 the	 VMs	 is	 Google	 Compute	 Engine. Using	this	service,	we	will	be	able	to	create	exactly	as	we	did	on	Amazon. Firstly,	 you	 need	 to	 activate	 the	 billing	 in	 your	 account.	 In	 your	 Dashboard within	 the	 project,	 click	 on	 Go	 to	 Compute	 Engine,	 and	 there,	 you	 have	 a button,	called	Enable	billing,	as	shown	in	the	following	figure:  Click	it	and	wait	for	a	few	minutes	for	the	configuration	to	complete.	Once	the  Figure	7.9   configuration	 is	 done,	 you	 can	 find	 the	 image	 with	 which	 you	 want	 to	 create your	instance	using	the	following	command:  You	 will	 find	 many	 options.	 In	 my	 case,	 I	 will	 use	 ubuntu-1804-xenial- 20200407.You	also	need	to	choose	the	zone	where	you	want	to	create	your	VM:  This	time,	I	will	create	my	VM	on	the	US	using	the	zone	 us-east1-b.	In	the AWS	part,	we	created	an	instance	with	the	t3.micro	size.	On	Google,	we	have	a respective,	but	with	a	different	name:   There	 are	 many	 machine	 family	 types	 which	 you	 can	 use.	 The	 difference between	 families	 is	 the	 purpose	 for	 what	 you	 want	 to	 use	 your	 VM.	 The	 E2 family	was	made	for	the	general	purpose	VMs.	So,	I	will	use	that	only	and	the smallest	size	is	micro,	which	corresponds	to	2	CPUs	and	1	GB	of	memory. Sometimes,	 just	 setting	 the	 image	 name	 when	 you	 are	 creating	 your	 VM	 can raise	an	error.

For	now,	this	is	enough	for	you	to	start	with	your	Infrastructure	on	GCP.  Provisioning	using	Azure As	we	did	with	the	other	Cloud	players,	we	are	going	to	do	the	same	on	Azure. The	goal	of	providing	the	same	Infrastructure,	in	the	same	way,	is	to	show	you the	process	and	make	you	feel	comfortable	in	choosing	the	one	you	prefer. The	first	step	is	installing	the	Azure	command-line	by	the	following	link: https:  docs.microsoft.com en-us cli azure install-azure-cli-windows? view=azure-cli-latest The	 installation	 process	 is	 exactly	 the	 same	 as	 all	 the	 MSI	 packages.	 Double   click,	click	 Next,	 Next,	and	 Finish.	After	the	installation	finishes,	you	can	run the	following	command	to	check	if	it	is	working: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	az	--version  Python	location	'C:\Program	Files	 x86 \Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\python.exe' Extensions	directory	'C:\Users\1511	MXTI\.azure\cliextensions' Python	 Windows 	3.6.6	 v3.6.6:4cf1f54eb7,	Jun	27	2018,	02:47:15  [MSC	v.1900	32	bit	 Intel ] Now,	the	Azure	CLI	is	installed	successfully.	To	begin	with,	run	the	following command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	az	login You	have	logged	in.	Now	let	us	find	all	the	subscriptions	to	which you	have	access… [  "cloudName":	"AzureCloud", "isDefault":	true, "managedByTenants":	[], "name":	"Pay-As-You-Go", "state":	"Enabled", "user":	{  "name":	"alisson.copyleft@gmail.com", "type":	"user"  {  }  }  ] The	 command,	 az	 login	 authenticates	 your	 command	 line	 with	 your	 Azure account. Similar	to	Google,	where	we	created	one	project	to	separate	all	the	provisioned services	by	context,	we	will	do	the	same	on	Azure,	but	instead	of	creating	the projects,	we	will	create	ResourceGroups. But,	 before	 creating	 the	 ResourceGroup,	 we	 need	 to	 know	 which	 location	 we will	use.	To	see	the	locations	available,	run	the	following	command:   PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>az	account	list-locations [  "displayName":	"Central	US", "id":	" subscriptions 55465d5a-355d-43d1-85ce- 9e518c812c0c locations centralus", "latitude":	"41.5908", "longitude":	"-93.6208", "name":	"centralus", "subscriptionId":	null  "displayName":	"East	US", "id":	" subscriptions 55465d5a-355d-43d1-85ce- 9e518c812c0c locations eastus", "latitude":	"37.3719", "longitude":	"-79.8164", "name":	"eastus", "subscriptionId":	null  {  }, {  },  ] The	command	will	show	all	the	locations	available.	In	my	case,	I	will	use	the East	US.	Now,	we	can	create	ResourceGroup	with	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>az	group	create	--location	eastus	--name	book {  "id":	" subscriptions 55465d5a-355d-43d1-85ce- 9e518c812c0c resourceGroups book", "location":	"eastus", "managedBy":	null, "name":	"book", "properties":	{  "provisioningState":	"Succeeded"  }, "tags":	null, "type":	"Microsoft.Resources resourceGroups"  } Now,	we	have	created	one	and	called	the	book,	and	within	it,	we	will	create	all the	resources	required	for	our	instance.	One	interesting	point	is,	when	you	delete your	resource	group,	everything	underlying	it	will	be	deleted	as	well: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	az	vm	image	list You	are	viewing	an	offline	list	of	images,	use	--all	to	retrieve	an up-to-date	list [   {  }, {  },  "offer":	"openSUSE-Leap", "publisher":	"SUSE", "sku":	"42.3", "urn":	"SUSE:openSUSE-Leap:42.3:latest", "urnAlias":	"openSUSE-Leap", "version":	"latest"  "offer":	"UbuntuServer", "publisher":	"Canonical", "sku":	"18.04-LTS", "urn":	"Canonical:UbuntuServer:18.04-LTS:latest", "urnAlias":	"UbuntuLTS", "version":	"latest"  ] The	preceding	command	will	show	you	the	images	available	to	create	your	VM. As	always,	we	will	choose	the	UbuntuServer.	Therefore,	you	can	create	the	VM by	running	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>az	vm	create	-n	vm1	-g	book	--image Canonical:UbuntuServer:18.04-LTS:latest	--admin-username	ubuntu {  "fqdns":	"", "id":	" subscriptions 55465d5a-355d-43d1-85ce- 9e518c812c0c resourceGroups book providers Microsoft.Compute virtualMachines vm1", "location":	"eastus", "macAddress":	"00-0D-3A-9A-DF-E9", "powerState":	"VM	running", "privateIpAddress":	"10.0.0.4", "publicIpAddress":	"52.224.120.36", "resourceGroup":	"book", "zones":	""  } For	the	image	name,	we	usually	refer	to	the	URN	 Uniform	Resource	Name , which	is	the	identification	for	the	image.	The	parameter,	 --admin-username	is the	user	who	will	have	the	access	to	run	sudo	and	do	the	administrative	tasks. The	Azure	command	line	is	smart	enough	to	get	your	default	SSH-key	and	add	it into	the	VM.	Therefore,	to	connect,	you	can	just	run	an	SSH	command	as	default and	login: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>ssh	ubuntu@52.224.120.36 The	authenticity	of	host	'52.224.120.36	 52.224.120.36 '	can't	be   established.

Conclusion I	 showed	 you	 how	 to	 create	 a	 VM	 in	 three	 of	 the	 main	 Cloud	 players.	 On Amazon,	I	showed	with	so	much	more	details	than	the	other	competitors.	But	I do	 not	 mean	 that	 it	 is	 harder	 than	 the	 other.	 It	 was	 just	 my	 explanation. Currently,	 I	 am	 working	 with	 Azure.	 But	 in	 the	 past,	 I	 have	 worked	 with Amazon	and	Google	as	well.	Therefore,	in	my	view,	a	good	DevOps	engineer should	be	able	to	work	with	all	the	platforms.	The	concepts	are	same	and	you can	deliver	the	same	essential	infrastructure.	There	is	another	concept	which	is called	Multicloud,	which	aims	to	use	all	the	Clouds	together	and	you	can	retrieve the	best	from	each	one,	like	authenticating	your	users	and	services	using	Azure Active	 Directory,	 creating	 the	 VMs	 using	 Amazon	 EC2,	 and	 query	 your	 data using	the	Big	Query	on	Google.   CHAPTER	8 Working	with	Terraform  T  his	chapter	aims	to	introduce	you	to	Terraform,	a	tool	to	help	you	with	the Multicloud	concept,	allowing	you	to	create	the	same	infrastructure	among  all	the	Cloud	players	in	the	same	automated	way.  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  Multicloud HashiCorp Introduction	to	Terraform Creating	the	Infrastructure  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Know	about	HashiCorp	tools Explain	what	Multicloud	is Use	Terraform	to	provide	Infrastructure Have	all	your	Infrastructure	as	Code  Multicloud We	 learned	 in	 the	 previous	 chapter	 that	 there	 are	 many	 Cloud	 providers available.	The	most	famous	are	AWS,	GCP,	and	Azure.	But,	we	also	have	other options	like	IBM	Cloud,	Oracle	Cloud,	Digital	Ocean,	etc.	Each	one	of	these	has its	services,	which	can	be	the	criteria	for	you	to	decide	among	them.	However, what	 can	 you	 do	 when	 you	 need	 the	 services	 from	 each	 one	 of	 them?	 For example,	 you	 must	 use	 an	 Active	 Directory	 Authentication,	 which	 is	 only available	on	Azure,	but	you	also	need	BigQuery	to	analyze	your	data,	and	it	is   only	available	on	GCP,	and	you	also	need	to	use	the	DynamoDB,	which	is	only available	on	AWS.	In	the	end,	you	have	an	on-premises	infrastructure	based	on OpenStack.	Therefore,	when	you	need	to	use	many	Cloud	providers,	we	call	that scenario	Multicloud.	The	challenge	now	is	how	to	manage	all	that	Infrastructure in	the	same	way,	and	perhaps,	by	using	the	same	tools.  HashiCorp HashiCorp	 is	 a	 company	 that	 created	 many	 tools	 to	 help	 you	 with	 the	 task	 of managing	 infrastructure	 among	 different	 scenarios,	 like	 AWS,	 GCP,	 Azure, Digital	Ocean,	etc.	We	already	have	experience	using	their	tools;	Vagrant	is	one of	 the	 tools	 from	 HashiCorp	 stack	 which	 we	 can	 use	 for	 our	 development environments.	In	their	stack,	you	can	find	the	following	tools:   https:  www.hashicorp.com products nomad 	  Packer	 https:  www.packer.io  :	This	is	a	tool	to	create	your	own	Cloud images.	In	the	Vagrant	chapter,	we	used	the	Ubuntu	Cloud	image	to	create our	VMs,	but	if	you	want	to	create	a	custom	image	with	your	application or	after	running	a	security	pipeline. Vagrant	 https:  www.vagrantup.com  :	You	already	know	that	tool.	We have	created	many	Virtual	Machines	and	tested	the	applications. Nomad	  :	 is	 an orchestrator	 to	 deploy	 your	 applications	 among	 different	 environments, like	the	public	Clouds	or	the	private	Clouds. Consul	  https:  www.hashicorp.com products consul  :	 It	 is	 commonly used	as	a	Service	Discovery	and	Service	Mesh. Vault	 https:  www.hashicorp.com products vault  :	It	is	a	tool	made	to manage	your	secrets.	It	is	an	alternative	for	the	secret	services	on	Cloud like	 Azure	 Secret,	 but,	 of	 course,	 with	 some	 differences,	 like	 rotate	 the secrets	automatically. Terraform	 https:  www.hashicorp.com products terraform  :	It	is	our focus	in	this	chapter.	I	will	show	you	how	to	create	the	Infrastructure	in	an easy	way	and	have	the	control	among	some	code	files.  It	  Introduction	to	Terraform Terraform	is	a	tool	to	create	and	manage	your	Infrastructure	as	Code	like	we	did using	Vagrant,	but	here,	with	more	details	and	using	public	Clouds	with	focus	on productions	environments,	not	just	laboratories,	as	we	did	earlier.   You	can	download	the	open-source	version	by	the	following	link: https:  www.terraform.io downloads.html You	 just	 need	 to	 unzip	 the	 file	 and	 include	 the	 path	 in	 the	 PATH	 environment variable.	After	that,	you	need	to	run	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	terraform--version Terraform	v0.12.24  If	 you	 have	 problems	 with	 the	 installation,	 HashiCorp	 has	 a	 tutorial explaining	 step-by-step: https:  learn.hashicorp.com tutorials terraform install-cli  how	  do	  to	  it	  The	current	version	is	v0.12.24,	which	is	the	installation	of	Terraform. Now,	we	can	create	the	files	and	create	our	first	VM	using	a	Cloud	provider.	I will	do	that	first	using	the	GCP	which	is	the	Cloud	provider	that	I	use	for	my personal	projects.	Then,	the	first	step	is	creating	a	folder	where	you	will	store your	code.  Of	 course,	 it	 is	 the	 best	 practice	 to	 split	 your	 code	 into	 many	 files,	 because	 it makes	the	code	reusable	and	easy	to	manage.	But	in	this,	we	will	just	create	one virtual	machine	to	learn	the	Terraform	syntax	and	understand	how	it	works.	So,	I will	create	everything	in	one	single	file. To	begin	with,	we	need	to	create	a	service	account	which	is	a	username	and	a password	 to	 create	 resources	 on	 my	 behalf.	 To	 access	 your	 Google	 Cloud Console	 https:  console.cloud.google.com  ,	go	to	IAM	&	Admin	and	on	Create service	account,	create	an	account	called	terraform,	as	shown	in	the	following screenshot:   Figure	8.1  Click	on	Create,	and	then	select	the	Role	Compute	Admin.	This	role	will	allow the	service	account	to	manage	all	the	resources	regarding	the	Compute	Engine, which	corresponds	to	our	VMs. Then,	 you	 must	 create	 a	 key	 in	 the	 JSON	 format	 as	 shown	 in	 the	 following screenshot:   Figure	8.2  Now,	you	have	the	service	account	configured	and	ready	to	use	with	Terraform. Copy	 the	 JSON	 file,	 and	 put	 it	 in	 the	 same	 folder	 where	 we	 will	 create	 the Terraform	 code.	 In	 the	 folder	 that	 we	 created,	 let's	 create	 a	 new	 file,	 called infrastructure.tf	with	the	following	content: provider	"google"	{  credentials	=	file "terraform_sa.json"  project					=	"alisson-187813" region						=	"us-east1"  } This	 code	 is	 necessary	 for	 Terraform.	 In	 this	 file,	 you	 will	 use	 the	 Google providers.	 Providers	 are	 modules	 created	 to	 make	 the	 interface	 between	 your Terraform	 code	 and	 the	 platform	 that	 you	 want	 to	 interact	 with.	 For	 example, once	I	had	a	situation	where	I	had	to	manage	a	DNS	server	on	Linux	 Bind9 . When	the	way	to	do	it	using	the	Terraform	was	using	the	TSIG	protocol,	I	had	to import	 the	 DNS	 provider.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 Azure,	 I	 imported	 the	 AzureRM provider.	If	you	want	to	get	to	know	more	about	that,	I	have	two	posts	on	my personal	blog. Using	 Azure	 and	 Terraform:	 http:  alissonmachado.com.br terraform-azure- criando-uma-infraestrutura-basica    DNS	  using	  Managing	 http:  alissonmachado.com.br terraform-gerenciando-dns-com-tsig  Getting	back	to	the	code,	the	providers	do	not	come	by	default	with	Terraform. You	must	download	them.	You	can	do	it	using	the	following	command: C:\Users\1511	MXTI\ProductionInfrastructure>	terraform	init  Terraform	  TSIG:  and	  Initializing	the	backend…  Initializing	provider	plugins… -	Checking	for	available	provider	plugins… -	Downloading	plugin	for	provider	"google"	 hashicorp google  3.20.0…  The	following	providers	do	not	have	any	version	constraints	in configuration,	so	the	latest	version	was	installed.  To	prevent	automatic	upgrades	to	new	major	versions	that	may contain	breaking	changes,	it	is	recommended	to	add	version	=	"…" constraints	to	the	corresponding	provider	blocks	in	configuration, with	the	constraint	strings	suggested	below.  *	provider.google:	version	=	"~>	3.20"  Terraform	has	been	successfully	initialized! You	may	now	begin	working	with	Terraform.	Try	running	"terraform	plan"	to see	 any	 changes	 that	 are	 required	 for	 your	 infrastructure.	 All	 Terraform commands	should	now	work. If	you	ever	set	or	change	modules	or	backend	configuration	for	Terraform,	rerun this	 command	 to	 reinitialize	 your	 working	 directory.	 If	 you	 forget,	 other commands	will	detect	it	and	remind	you	to	do	so	if	necessary. Now,	 you	 are	 able	 to	 create	 the	 Infrastructure	 because	 you	 already	 have	 the provider	installed	in	your	local	machine.	Therefore,	include	the	following	code to	create	our	first	instance: provider	"google"	{  credentials	=	file "terraform_sa.json"  project					=	"alisson-187813" region						=	"us-east1"  }  resource	"google_compute_instance""chapter8"	{  name									=	"chapter8-instance" machine_type	=	"g1-small" zone									=	"us-east1-b" boot_disk	{   initialize_params	{ image	=	"ubuntu-1804-bionic-v20200414" }  } network_interface	{  network	=	"default" access_config	{ }  }  } In	 the	 preceding	 code,	 we	 defined	 that	 we	 will	 use	 a	 resource	 called google_compute_instance	 which	 corresponds	 to	 a	 VM	 as	 we	 did	 in	 the previous	chapter.	But,	now	we	are	doing	so	using	Terraform.	This	instance	will be	 created	 using	 the	 Ubuntu	 1804	 image	 in	 the	 zone	 us-east1-b	 and	 the	 other details,	like	networking	configurations.

The	 command	 Terraform	 plan	 will	 check	 your	 project	 on	 Google	 and	 make	 a difference	to	see	what	is	different	between	your	code	and	the	project	on	Google.

Terraform	is	a	great	tool, but	 you	 need	 to	 take	 care	 before	 running	 the	 commands,	 otherwise,	 you	 can destroy	all	your	Infrastructure	using	it.	There	is	a	famous	sentence	about	that.

But,	as	you	can	see,	the	command brought	to	us	the	name,	the	public_ip	and	the	instance	size.	If	you	want	to	see these	values	again,	you	can	run	terraform	output: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\ProductionInfrastructure>	terraform	output name	=	chapter8-instance public_ip	=	104.196.24.122 size	=	g1-small Even	then,	we	cannot	access	the	instance,	because	we	did	not	define	any	SSH key	or	password.

Now,	we	do	not	have	anything	else	costing	in	our	GCP	account	and	if you	 want	 to	 create	 the	 Infrastructure	 again,	 you	 can	 just	 run	 the	 command terraform	 apply.

Conclusion This	chapter	showed	us	that	it	is	not	necessary	to	learn	the	command	line	of	all the	 Cloud	 players	 or	 even	 install	 the	 SDK	 for	 each	 one	 of	 them.	 Using Terraform,	 we	 are	 able	 to	 code	 the	 Infrastructure	 using	 the	 Terraform	 syntax, change	 the	 providers	 to	 make	 different	 integrations,	 and	 see	 what	 will	 be changed,	 created,	 or	 destroyed.	 I	 really	 recommend	 you	 to	 explore	 other providers	to	integrate	with	Azure,	AWS,	Digital	Ocean,	and	play	around	other providers	 which	 are	 not	 related	 to	 the	 Cloud	 player,	 but	 they	 can	 help	 you	 to provide	Infrastructure,	like	the	DNS	module.   CHAPTER	9 Working	with	Git  his	 chapter	 aims	 to	 introduce	 you	 to	 Git,	 a	 tool	 to	 help	 you	 work	 in	 the same	code,	and	collaborate	with	other	developers	in	the	same	project	in	a  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  T  remote	way.  Git GitFlow GitHub  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Install	and	use	Git	with	the	local	repositories Understand	the	GitFlow	and	how	it	can	be	applied	in	the	daily	work Share	your	code	with	other	people	using	GitHub  Git Git	is	a	tool	created	by	Linus	Torvalds,	the	creator	of	the	Linux	system.	The	tool was	created	to	help	the	Linux	developers	control	the	development	flow	among many	 developers	 around	 the	 world.	 It	 helps	 to	 solve	 conflicts,	 track	 the modifications,	 or	 even	 revert	 the	 configurations	 that	 were	 working	 before	 and stopped	working	in	a	new	version. To	install	Git,	you	can	access	the	following	link: https:  git-scm.com download win The	installation	process	is	the	same	that	we	did	for	all	Windows	applications; just	Next,	Next,	and	Finish.	After	the	installation,	you	will	find	a	new	program   called	 Git	 Bash,	 which	 allows	 you	 to	 create	 your	 local	 repos	 and	 use	 the	 Git commands	to	create	versions	of	your	application:  Figure	9.1  In	the	next	steps,	I	will	show	you	some	basic	commands	which	are	enough	for you	to	use	Git	in	your	daily	work.	Of	course,	it	is	possible	to	create	an	entire book	 just	 to	 explain	 the	 Git	 commands	 and	 how	 to	 deal	 with	 conflicts	 and different	 strategies	 of	 versioning	 code.	 However,	 let's	 keep	 with	 the	 basics because	“done	is	better	than	perfect": 1511	MXTI@avell	MINGW64	~ $	mkdir	Chapter09  1511	MXTI@avell	MINGW64	~ $	cd	Chapter09  Aforementioned,	you	have	the	output	of	my	Git	Bash.	Creating	a	folder,	called Chapter09	and	get	inside	that	folder.	Here,	I	will	create	my	first	repository: 1511	MXTI@avell	MINGW64	~ Chapter09 $	git	init Initialized	empty	Git	repository	in	C: Users 1511 MXTI Chapter09 .git  The	 command	 git	 init	 is	 responsible	 to	 initialize	 any	 folder	 of	 a	 Git repository.	 It	 basically	 creates	 a	 folder,	 called	 .git	 with	 a	 pre-defined	 folder structure	 which	 will	 store	 the	 files	 with	 the	 metadata	 for	 your	 code,	 like	 what   was	changed	from	the	current	version	of	the	code	and	your	modifications,	which files	 you	 want	 to	 send	 to	 the	 new	 version,	 and	 other	 things.	 A	 repository	 is	 a folder	where	you	store	and	track	the	modifications	of	your	code. Now,	we	can	use	any	text	editor	to	create	some	code	and	track	the	changes.	I will	use	the	Visual	Studio	Code,	because	it	is	my	favorite.	But,	feel	free	to	use any	according	to	your	preference:  Figure	9.2  I	created	a	new	file	called	 code.txt	 in	the	text	editor,	just	too	as	an	example with	 some	 random	 content.	 Within	 the	 Git	 repositories,	 we	 can	 track	 the modifications	 of	 any	 kind	 of	 the	 text	 file,	 Python	 codes,	 C++	 codes,	 Java,	 or whatsoever. The	next	step	is	to	check	what	changed	since	the	beginning	when	I	created	the repository	 and	 created	 the	 file,	 the	 Visual	 Studio	 Code	 as	 integration	 with	 the PowerShell.	Thus,	I	will	use	it	to	run	the	Git	commands. The	first	command	is	git	status: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	status On	branch	master  No	commits	yet Untracked	files:  use	"git	add	 …"	to	include	in	what	will	be	committed  code.txt  nothing	added	to	commit	but	untracked	files	present	 use	"git	add" to	track  In	the	preceding	command,	we	can	see	that	we	are	on	the	branch	master	and	we have	one	untraced	file,	called	code.txt.	The	branches	are	the	versions	that	you   can	have	of	the	same	project.	You	can	use	it	in	the	way	that	you	want,	with	the name	that	you	want.	However,	create	a	flow	which	helps	you	to	keep	a	standard of	the	organization.	Otherwise,	each	project	would	have	a	versioning	strategy.  GitFlow Now,	when	we	start	working	on	a	project,	we	have	the	code	files	that	are	already in	 production,	 and	 we	 cannot	 work	 in	 the	 main	 branch,	 because	 of	 the	 CI CD pipelines.	We	need	to	generate	a	new	version	of	our	software	with	the	complete code. Let's	commit	the	first	version	of	the	code,	which	will	be	shared	among	all	the developers	working	in	the	same	project: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	add	--all PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	commit	-m	"uploading	the scaffold	of	the	project" [master	 root-commit 	f6284bf]	uploading	the	scaffold	of	the project 1	file	changed,	3	insertions +  create	mode	100644	code.txt If	we	run	the	git	status	again,	nothing	is	untraced	or	pending	to	commit: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	status On	branch	master nothing	to	commit,	working	tree	clean To	check	the	branches	you	have,	run	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	branch *	master Now,	we	need	to	work	on	that	code	without	breaking	the	version	in	production, which	 corresponds	 to	 the	 branch	 master.	 Then,	 we	 will	 create	 a	 new	 branch, called	develop,	which	is	the	branch	respective	to	a	new	version	of	our	software: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	checkout	-b	develop Switched	to	a	new	branch	'develop' We	created	a	new	branch.	Now,	if	we	run	the	command	git	branch	again,	we can	see	that	another	version	of	our	current	code	is	created,	which	we	can	modify without	changing	anything	in	the	current	version: S	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	branch *	develop   master We	created	a	new	branch,	then	if	we	run	the	command	 git	 branch	again,	we can	 see	 that	 another	 version	 of	 our	 current	 code	 was	 created,	 which	 we	 can modify	without	changing	anything	in	the	current	version:  Figure	9.3  In	 the	 preceding	 figure,	 I	 have	 added	 a	 new	 line	 into	 our	 code.	 This	 book	 is about	infrastructure.	Therefore,	I	want	to	show	that	we	can	include	the	new	code respective	to	infrastructure,	and	we	also	have	the	development	infrastructure	and the	production	infrastructure,	whichever	one	has	their	configurations	and	codes. I	can	run	the	command	git	status	again,	and	see	what	has	changed: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	status On	branch	develop Changes	not	staged	for	commit:  use	"git	add	 …"	to	update	what	will	be	committed   use	"git	restore	 …"	to	discard	changes	in	working	directory  modified:			code.txt  no	changes	added	to	commit	 use	"git	add"	and or	"git	commit	-a"  Different	from	the	first	file,	the	 code.txt	is	now	modified,	not	untraced	as	we saw	in	the	first	command,	which	means	that	it	is	not	a	new	file	and	the	file	was modified.	If	you	want	to	check	what	has	changed	from	the	old	version,	you	can use	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	diff	code.txt diff	--git	a code.txt	b code.txt index	70274ce..9c5fd1c	100644 ---	a code.txt +++	b code.txt @@	-1,3	+1,5	@@ Hello!   -This	is	my	first	code! \	No	newline	at	end	of	file +This	is	my	first	code! + +This	is	the	configuration	respective	to	the	VMs	size. \	No	newline	at	end	of	file Here,	we	can	see	the	differences	between	the	two	versions.	Where	we	have	the  + 	plus	sign,	means	that	the	lines	were	included	in	the	file,	with	the	 - minus sign,	we	have	what	was	removed	from	the	old	version.	To	save	this	new	version and	share	with	the	other	developers,	we	must	add	the	file	in	this	new	version	and commit	the	changes: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	add	--all PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	commit	-m	"adding	new configurations" [develop	806990f]	adding	new	configurations 1	file	changed,	3	insertions + ,	1	deletion -  Now,	let's	assume	that	we	tested	everything	and	we	want	to	put	the	development version	in	production.	Now,	we	need	to	merge	the	development	code	with	the production	code.	To	do	this,	we	can	use	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	checkout	master Switched	to	branch	'master' PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	merge	develop Updating	f6284bf..806990f Fast-forward code.txt		4	+++- 1	file	changed,	3	insertions + ,	1	deletion -  Perfect!	Now	we	have	the	development	version	in	production.	So,	we	can	deploy it	and	start	to	work	again	in	the	other	version.	But,	let's	make	the	things	a	little bit	more	sophisticated.	Firstly,	we	have	to	go	back	to	the	development	branch: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>git	checkout	develop Switched	to	branch	'develop' We	 can	 suppose	 that	 we	 want	 to	 change	 the	 current	 operating	 system	 of	 the infrastructure.	 Assuming	 that	 it	 is	 based	 on	 CentOS,	 we	 want	 to	 change	 to Ubuntu.	 However,	 we	 cannot	 change	 it	 in	 the	 development	 environment, because	it	can	stop	the	developers	working	on	their	own	projects.	Therefore,	I have	to	create	a	new	branch	based	on	the	development	branch	which	we	usually call	the	feature	branch. PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>git	checkout	-b	feature-ubuntu   Switched	to	a	new	branch	'feature-ubuntu' Now,	I	will	write	the	new	code:  Figure	9.4  After	testing	the	code	in	the	ephemeral	environment	which	was	created	based	on the	development	environment	and	making	sure	that	it	is	working,	we	can	commit the	changes	and	merge	it	with	the	development	environment: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	add	--all PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	commit	-m	"changing	the	os" [feature-ubuntu	5b4ce7a]	changing	the	os 1	file	changed,	3	insertions + ,	1	deletion -  Now,	 we	 can	 change	 from	 the	 feature	 branch	 to	 the	 development	 branch	 and merge	the	code: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	checkout	develop Switched	to	branch	'develop' PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	merge	feature-ubuntu Updating	806990f..5b4ce7a Fast-forward code.txt		4	+++- 1	file	changed,	3	insertions + ,	1	deletion -  The	code	was	merged	successfully	and	now	assuming	that	we	have	tested	it	in the	 development	 environment	 and	 everything	 worked	 seamlessly,	 it	 is	 time	 to merge	with	the	production	environment: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	checkout	master Switched	to	branch	'master' PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	merge	develop Updating	806990f..5b4ce7a Fast-forward   code.txt		4	+++- 1	file	changed,	3	insertions + ,	1	deletion -   GitHub The	commands	ran	in	the	local	machine	and	in	a	local	environment.	It	was	just the	basic	steps,	but	I	am	pretty	sure	that	with	these	commands	you	will	be	able	to do	80%	of	your	work	every	day.	If	you	cannot,	there	are	many	tools	to	help	you with	the	Git	commands,	like	git	kraken,	or	you	can	even	use	plugins	for	Visual Studio	Code.	We	need	to	have	in	mind	that	as	bigger	as	your	team	is,	you	will have	more	conflicts	and	more	changes	happening	at	the	same	time. To	 share	 our	 code,	 we	 can	 use	 many	 tools,	 like	 GitLab,	 GitHub,	 Bitbucket. There	are	dozens	of	services	to	help	you	with	it.	Let's	use	the	GitHub	because	it is	the	most	famous.	But,	for	some	of	my	personal	projects,	I	use	the	Bitbucket, because	we	can	have	unlimited	private	repos. You	can	create	your	own	GitHub	account	for	free	on	their	website: https:  github.com  After	creating	your	account,	you	will	be	able	to	create	your	first	repository,	as	I am	doing	in	the	following	screenshot:   Figure	9.5  After	creating	the	repository,	the	initial	page	will	show	some	commands	in	case you	have	an	existing	repo	and	you	want	to	upload	it,	or	if	you	want	to	clone	the empty	repository.	In	our	case,	we	already	have	the	code	with	some	commits	and we	want	to	send	it	to	Git. The	 next	 screenshot	 will	 show	 the	 initial	 page.	 But	 the	 most	 important information	is	the	following	one: https:  github.com AlissonMMenezes Chapter09.git Which	corresponds	to	the	address	of	our	remote	repository:   Figure	9.6  Going	back	to	the	Visual	Studio	Code,	I	will	add	the	remote	URL	to	my	local repository	using	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	remote	add githubhttps:  github.com AlissonMMenezes Chapter09.git  PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	remote	-v github		https:  github.com AlissonMMenezes Chapter09.git	 fetch  github		https:  github.com AlissonMMenezes Chapter09.git	 push  Now	that	we	have	this	configured,	I	can	send	the	code	to	the	remote	repository. We	call	that	action	push,	because	the	command	that	we	will	use	is	the	git	push: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Chapter09>	git	push	github	master Enumerating	objects:	9,	done. Counting	objects:	100%	 9 9 ,	done. Delta	compression	using	up	to	8	threads Compressing	objects:	100%	 5 5 ,	done. Writing	objects:	100%	 9 9 ,	789	bytes		394.00	KiB s,	done. Total	9	 delta	1 ,	reused	0	 delta	0 ,	pack-reused	0 remote:	Resolving	deltas:	100%	 1 1 ,	done. To	https:  github.com AlissonMMenezes Chapter09.git *	[new	branch]						master	->	master   The	push	command	follows	that	sequence.	git	push	repo_name	branch.	Now, we	push	the	code	to	GitHub	and	the	branch	master.	If	we	go	back	to	GitHub,	it	is possible	to	see	the	code	there:  Figure	9.7  Now,	it	is	so	much	easier	to	see	what	has	changed,	because	we	have	a	graphical interface	 with	 the	 number	 of	 commits,	 the	 branches	 and	 so	 much	 more information.	Now,	you	can	delete	your	local	repository	because	your	code	is	safe on	GitHub. I	deleted	my	local	repository	and	let's	assume	that	I	am	a	new	developer.	Now,	I have	 to	 fetch	 the	 code	 from	 GitHub,	 make	 my	 changes,	 and	 push	 it	 back. However,	when	we	are	working	in	a	team,	it	is	a	good	practice	to	create	a	new branch,	push	my	branch,	and	create	a	pull	request.	But,	why	that?	We	do	that	for another	developer	to	do	what	we	call	code	review.	Thus,	he	will	analyze	your code	and	validate	if	it	is	in	the	good	practices	defined	by	the	company. As	a	new	developer,	the	first	thing	I	have	to	do	is	clone	the	repository	using	the following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>git	clone https:  github.com AlissonMMenezes Chapter09.git Cloning	into	'Chapter09'… remote:	Enumerating	objects:	9,	done. remote:	Counting	objects:	100%	 9 9 ,	done. remote:	Compressing	objects:	100%	 4 4 ,	done. remote:	Total	9	 delta	1 ,	reused	9	 delta	1 ,	pack-reused	0 Receiving	objects:	100%	 9 9 ,	done.

Let's	take	a	look:  Figure	9.9  We	can	give	a	title	that	corresponds	to	what	we've	done.	For	example,	it	could be	 the	 name	 of	 your	 Jira	 task,	 something	 like	 DASF-158:	 changing	 the	 SSH keys.	You	can	describe	what	you’ve	done	if	you	want,	or	just	give	a	message	for the	code	reviews.	For	example,	please	give	a	look	at	the	lines	between	55	and	99. I	am	not	sure	if	my	logic	is	correct.	Now,	you	can	create	the	pull	request:   This	is	how	a	PR	 Pull	Request 	looks	like.	And	now,	we	can	merge	with	the master	branch	or	another	branch	we	want	to:  Figure	9.10   Figure	9.11  Conclusion That	was	a	really	quick	and	short	introduction	to	Git.	But,	I	am	pretty	sure	that	it is	enough	for	your	daily	tasks.	Of	course,	in	the	real	world,	we	will	face	many conflicts.	As	bigger	the	team	is	that	you	work	with,	more	challenges	and	more complex	will	it	be	to	manage	the	code,	the	branches,	and	the	reviews.	If	you	are in	lucky	work	startup	and	you	are	the	DevOps	guy	who	is	in	charge	of	all	the Cloud	Infrastructure,	this	probably	will	attend	to	100%	of	your	necessities.   CHAPTER	10 Continuous	Integration	and	Continuous Delivery	Using	Jenkins  T  his	 chapter	 aims	 to	 introduce	 you	 to	 the	 concept	 of	 Pipelines,	 CI  Continuous	Integration ,	and	CD	 Continuous	Delivery .	It	also	gives  an	introduction	to	Jenkins,	the	most	famous	CI CD	platform	and	open-source.  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  Pipelines Continuous	Integration Continuous	Delivery Pipeline	as	Code	and	Jenkins  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Know	about	DevOps	pipelines Differentiate	and	how	to	implement	CI CD Create	your	pipelines	as	code	using	Groovy	and	Jenkins Deploy	an	application	using	Vagrant,	Docker,	and	Jenkins  Pipelines We	can	define	a	pipeline	as	a	sequence	of	steps,	which	will	take	one	thing	from a	 starting	 point	 to	 an	 ending	 point,	 following	 a	 predefined	 path.	 In	 our	 case, when	the	code	enters	the	pipeline,	we	have	to	check	many	things,	like	the	code quality,	 best	 practices,	 running	 tests,	 generating	 a	 ZIP	 file,	 and	 it	 can	 be increased	as	much	as	you	want.	At	the	end	of	your	pipeline,	you	will	have	your   code	with	quality,	following	the	best	practices	and	ready	to	deploy	everything	in an	 automated	 way.	 It	 helps	 you	 improve	 the	 quality	 of	 your	 product	 or infrastructure,	and	speed	up	the	process,	as	no	one	has	to	test	each	part	of	the pipeline.	For	some	pipelines,	the	DevOps	practices	defined	specific	names,	like Continuous	Integration	and	Continuous	Delivery.  Continuous	Integration Usually,	when	we	are	developing	a	software,	we	have	many	stages	where	our application	goes	through	before	reaching	the	end	customer.	Currently,	we	have these	most	common	stages:  Development:	 Where	 the	 developers	 can	 test	 the	 applications,	 fix	 bugs, and	 validate	 new	 feature	 requests.	 In	 this	 environment,	 we	 can	 break everything	because	it	will	not	affect	our	end	customers. Staging:	A	copy	of	the	production	environment,	but	just	for	the	business team	to	validate	the	business	rules	if	they	follow	the	requirements	defined by	 the	 clients.	 In	 this	 environment,	 we	 can	 have	 failures	 and	 new improvement	requests.	Following	this	is	the	last	stage	before	it	goes	to	the end	customer. Production:	 This	 environment	 is	 where	 the	 application	 is	 in	 production, with	 everything	 validated,	 tested,	 and	 ready	 for	 our	 end	 customer.	 Of course,	bugs	can	be	found	here,	but	the	goal	is	to	deliver	the	applications	as much	tested	as	we	can	to	avoid	problems.  The	Continuous	Integration	pipeline	is	created	to	connect	all	the	environment. For	example,	in	the	development	stage,	we	have	to	follow	some	of	the	following tests:  Unit	tests:	This	test	aims	to	validate	the	business	rules	for	each	part	of	our code,	 like	 classes,	 methods,	 functions,	 or	 whatsoever.	 But,	 these	 are	 the simplest	tests	that	you	can	do	in	your	application.	For	example,	you	can receive	the	task	of	creating	a	function	where	you	need	to	sum	2	numbers. Your	 test	 will	 pass	 the	 numbers	 to	 that	 function	 and	 check	 if	 you	 are returning	the	expected	result. Integration	tests:	Here,	you	will	have	to	test	a	business	case.	For	example, you	 created	 an	 API.	 Your	 end	 customer	 will	 make	 a	 request	 sending	 2 parameters	 and	 he	 is	 expecting	 a	 JSON	 response	 with	 a	 product	 data.	 In this	case,	we	do	not	need	to	check	what	is	happening	in	the	source	code	of   your	 API,	 we	 just	 need	 to	 make	 sure	 that	 when	 we	 receive	 those	 2 parameters,	we	will	return	the	JSON	with	the	product	data. End-to-end:	This	is	the	hardest	test	that	you	have	in	your	application.	It will	 test	 your	 entire	 system,	 each	 functionality	 in	 detail	 impersonating	 a real	 customer.	 It	 takes	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 to	 be	 developed,	 so,	 most	 of	 the companies	stop	at	the	integration	tests. Quality	test:	This	test	is	used	more	to	check	the	quality	of	your	code.	If you	are	following	the	best	practices,	if	you	are	creating	reusable	codes,	and not	 just	 copying	 and	 pasting	 code	 everywhere	 in	 your	 code,	 which	 will make	the	maintenance	harder.  Of	course,	those	tests	that	I	explained	are	just	common	tests	that	you	will	find	in most	 of	 the	 companies	 that	 you	 will	 work.	 However,	 there	 are	 more	 ways	 of testing	 applications.	 It	 can	 vary	 from	 project	 to	 project	 and	 company	 to company. Once	 we	 pass	 in	 all	 these	 tests,	 we	 have	 to	 make	 our	 application	 go	 to	 other teams	who	will	also	test	the	application,	many	times	in	a	manual	way,	to	make sure	that	the	developer	understood	what	the	requirements	are	and	how	we	need to	code	our	product.	This	is	where	we	have	the	Continuous	Delivery.  Continuous	Delivery In	 this	 stage,	 the	 developer	 did	 all	 work	 they	 were	 delegated	 to	 do.	 But,	 of course,	we	can	have	many	communication	problems	between	the	client	request and	the	software	delivery. Therefore,	once	all	the	tests	were	made	by	the	developers,	we	can	assume	that we	 have	 a	 new	 version	 of	 our	 application,	 which	 can	 be	 called	 version	 0.1. Assuming	 that	 it	 is	 working,	 we	 will	 create	 a	 package	 of	 that	 application	 and deploy	 it	 in	 the	 staging	 environment.	 In	 this	 environment,	 someone	 from	 the business	 part	 of	 the	 company	 will	 validate	 again	 if	 the	 feature	 requests	 are working	properly	as	they	requested.	This	stage	is	also	used	for	the	UX	team	to validate	if	your	interface	is	understandable	and	easy	to	use.	If	this	version	of	the application	 does	 not	 fulfill	 all	 the	 requirements,	 or	 the	 developers	 did	 not understand	how	the	new	feature	should	work,	this	version	can	be	discarded	and they	will	work	in	a	new	version	called,	0.2.	For	example,	and	it	will	pass	through all	the	environments	again	until	it	fulfills	all	the	requirements	specified	by	the end	customer. At	the	end	of	the	day,	Continuous	Delivery	is	being	able	to	deploy	a	version	of   your	 application	 every	 time	 a	 new	 feature	 is	 released.	 Not	 accumulating	 these features	will	be	harder	to	test,	since	many	are	not	uncommon	for	business	areas validating	the	application	manually.  Pipeline	as	Code	and	Jenkins We	 have	 many	 tools	 which	 can	 help	 us	 with	 the	 pipelines	 and	 integration between	the	environment,	and	indeed	Jenkins	is	the	most	famous,	because	of	its flexibility	 that	 allows	 us	 to	 install	 many	 plugins	 to	 easily	 integrate	 with	 the Cloud	providers	and	also	being	open	source.	Thus,	we	do	not	need	to	pay	for	a license. The	focus	of	this	book	is	not	especially	software	development,	but	Infrastructure as	Code.	So,	all	the	examples	that	I	will	use	will	be	regarding	Infrastructure	and how	we	can	test	and	deploy	it. Firstly,	 we	 need	 to	 setup	 our	 Jenkins	 server.	 I	 will	 setup	 it	 using	 Vagrant.	 To create	a	VM	with	Ubuntu,	install	Docker,	and	then,	Jenkins	will	run	on	top	of	the Docker: 	-*-	mode:	ruby	-*- 	vi:	set	ft=ruby	: Vagrant.configure "2" 	do	config config.vm.box	=	"ubuntu bionic64" config.vm.box_check_update	=	false config.vm.provider	"virtualbox"	do	vb  vb.memory	=	"1024"  end  config.vm.define	"docker"	do	docker  docker.vm.box	=	"ubuntu bionic64" docker.vm.network	"private_network",	ip:	"192.168.33.11" docker.vm.hostname	=	"docker" docker.vm.provision	"shell",	inline:	<<-SHELL  apt	clean apt-get	update apt-get	remove	docker	docker-engine	docker.io	containerd	runc	- y apt-get	install	apt-transport-https	ca-certificates	curl	gnupg- agent	software-properties-common	-y curl	-fsSL	https:  download.docker.com linux ubuntu gpg		apt- key	add	- add-apt-repository	"deb	[arch=amd64] https:  download.docker.com linux ubuntu	$ lsb_release	-cs  stable"   apt-get	update	-y apt-get	install	docker.io	-y  SHELL  end  end The	preceding	code	is	just	edited	a	little	bit	from	chapter06.	Then,	we	already know	 how	 to	 install	 and	 run	 a	 VM	 on	 Vagrant.	 Now,	 I	 have	 a	 Docker environment	running	and	to	run	the	Jenkins	in	a	container	is	very	simple.	Just run	the	following	command:  root@docker:~	docker	run	-tdi	--restart=always	--name	jenkins	-p 8080:8080	-p	50000:50000	jenkins jenkins:lts After	the	containers	start,	you	can	access	the	Jenkins	by	the	following	address: http:  192.168.33.11:8080 login?from=%2F It	will	show	you	the	following	screen	asking	for	the	initial	password:  Figure	10.1   You	can	get	the	password	by	running	the	following	command:  docker	exec	-ti	jenkins	cat  var jenkins_home secrets initialAdminPassword a7a1b2c796404bceab99b014f3220a9a You	can	just	copy	the	password:  a7a1b2c796404bceab99b014f3220a9a Paste	in	the	screen	and	proceed	with	the	installation.  Figure	10.2  It	is	highly	recommended	to	install	the	suggested	plugins	because	it	will	install one	of	the	most	important,	which	is	the	git	plugin.	Now,	you	just	need	to	follow the	sequence,	Next,	Next,	and	Finish,	to	finalize	your	installation.   The	 last	 part	 of	 the	 installation	 is	 setting	 your	 admin	 credentials.	 I	 have	 set admin admin	for	user	and	password.	Finally,	welcome	to	Jenkins:  Figure	10.3   Figure	10.4  Everyone	who	has	worked	with	Jenkins	knows	that	the	UX	is	not	one	of	Jenkins’ strengths.	To	work	around	this	problem,	there	is	a	very	famous	plugin,	called	the Blue	Ocean	to	improve	our	interface	and	usability. Go	to	Manage	Jenkins		Manage	Plugins		Available	and	Search	for	the	Blue Ocean:  Install	 the	 plugin	 and	 restart	 Jenkins.	 After	 everything,	 you	 will	 see	 a	 new button,	Open	Blue	Ocean	is	available:  Figure	10.5   Click	on	the	button	and	check	the	new	interface:  Figure	10.6   Figure	10.7  From	the	initial	screen,	we	can	see	that	it	is	so	much	better.	Of	course,	it	is	not mandatory	to	use	this	interface.	It	is	just	some	sort	of	fancy	feature,	but	I	liked	it. Not	just	for	the	interface,	but	it	also	makes	mandatory	the	usage	of	a	repository to	 versioning	 your	 pipelines.	 You	 can	 click	 on	 Create	 a	 new	 Pipeline	 and check	it:  Figure	10.8  In	my	case,	I	will	select	GitHub,	because	I	have	already	created	a	repository	for this	chapter.	Creating	the	pipeline	is	pretty	simple.	You	can	just	follow	the	steps showed	in	the	screen	followed,	create	an	access	token	on	GitHub,	and	bind	it	to your	installation,	like	the	preceding	screenshot:    Figure	10.9  In	the	bound	repository,	you	must	have	a	file,	called	Jenkinsfile,	in	the	root.	The Jenkins	will	scan	the	files	looking	for	that	specific	one,	read	the	code,	and	run the	pipeline.	I	already	created	one	with	the	following	code: pipeline	{  agent	any; stages	{  steps	{  stage 'Code	Quality' 	{  sh	'echo	checking	code	quality'  } stage 'Unit	Tests' 	{  steps	{  sh	'echo	Testing	the	Applications'  }  }  }  }  }  }  }  } stage 'Build' 	{  steps	{  } stage 'Delivery' 	{  steps	{  } stage 'Deploy' 	{  steps	{  sh	'echo	Creating	application	Package'  sh	'echo	Uploading	the	artifact	to	a	repository'  sh	'echo	Deploying	the	Application'  } Jenkins	uses	the	Groovy	language	to	write	the	pipelines.	It	was	a	basic	scaffold of	what	are	the	basics	we	need	to	have	in	our	pipeline.	Saving	everything	and checking	 the	 interface,	 you	 will	 see	 that	 the	 pipeline	 ran	 automatically	 and successfully:   Figure	10.10  In	the	code,	we	just	have	some	echo	statements	which	are	representing	the	real codes.	Now,	we	need	to	replace	them	with	a	real	application	and	real	commands to	check	the	application,	test	the	application,	and	deploy	it	after	all.	However,	of course,	 it	 will	 not	 be	 a	 complex	 application.	 Nevertheless,	 we	 will	 have everything,	and	here	is	what	the	application	will	do. Create	 an	 API	 which	 will	 receive	 credit	 card	 transactions	 and	 to	 validate	 the transactions	follow	these	criteria:  1.	 Validate	if	the	credit	card	is	active. 2.	 Validate	if	the	transaction	amount	is	above	the	credit	card	limit. 3.	 Validate	if	the	transaction	was	approved.  The	API	must	receive	a	JSON	request	in	the	following	format: {  "status":	true, "number":123456, "limit":1000, "transaction":{  "amount":500  }  } Now,	 I	 developed	 everything	 using	 Flask,	 because	 is	 fast	 and	 easy.	 The	 API code	is	as	follows: ! usr bin python3  from	flask	import	Flask,	request,	jsonify from	functools	import	wraps   app	=	Flask __name__   def	check_card f :  wraps f  def	validation *args,	**kwargs :  data	=	request.get_json   if	not	data.get "status" :  response	=	{"approved":False, "newLimit":data.get "limit" , "reason":"Blocked	Card"} return	jsonify response   if	data.get "limit" 	<	data.get "transaction" .get "amount" :  response	=	{"approved":False, "newLimit":data.get "limit" , "reason":"Transaction	above	the	limit"} return	jsonify response  return	f *args,	**kwargs   return validation   @app.route " api transaction",methods=["POST"]  @check_card def	transaction  :  card	=	request.get_json   new_limit	=	card.get "limit" 	- card.get "transaction" .get "amount"  response	=	{"approved":True,"newLimit":new_limit} return	jsonify response   if	__name__	==	'__main__':  app.run debug=True   The	 application	 is	 receiving	 the	 transactions	 and	 the	 validating	 via	 Python decorators.	 If	 tested	 manually,	 it	 works.	 But,	 it	 is	 very	 exhaustive	 to	 test everything	 every	 time.	 That	 is	 why,	 we	 create	 automated	 tests.	 In	 this	 case,	 I have	3	business	rules	that	were	already	mentioned	and	here	follows	the	code	for those	tests: ! usr bin python3  import	os import	tempfile  import	pytest  from	app	import	app  @pytest.fixture   def	client  :  app.config['TESTING']	=	True client	=	app.test_client    yield	client  def	test_valid_transaction client :  card	=	{  "status":	True, "number":123456, "limit":1000, "transaction":{  "amount":500  rv	=	client.post " api transaction",json=card  assert	True	==	rv.get_json  .get "approved"  assert	500	==	rv.get_json  .get "newLimit"   def	test_above_limit client :  card	=	{  "status":	True, "number":123456, "limit":1000, "transaction":{ "amount":1500  rv	=	client.post " api transaction",json=card  assert	False	==	rv.get_json  .get "approved"  assert	"Transaction	above	the	limit"	in rv.get_json  .get "reason"   def	test_blocked_card client :  card	=	{  "status":	False, "number":123456, "limit":1000, "transaction":{  "amount":500  }  }  }  }  }  }  rv	=	client.post " api transaction",json=card  assert	False	==	rv.get_json  .get "approved"  assert	"Blocked	Card"	in	rv.get_json  .get "reason"   Of	 course,	 I	 also	 need	 to	 install	 some	 external	 module	 which	 must	 be	 in	 the requirements.txt	file:   pytest flask pylint Now,	you	have	the	following	three	files: app.py test_app.py requirements.txt This	belongs	to	the	application	and	we	have	the	Jekinsfile,	which	is	not	a	part	of the	application,	but	it	is	important	for	the	process,	in	general.	The	next	step	is	to prepare	 the	 Jenkins	 environment	 to	 test	 the	 application.	 Of	 course,	 we	 do	 not need	much,	just	the	Python	and	the	PIP	to	install	the	new	modules.	Then,	you can	run	the	following	command	within	the	container:  root@docker:~	docker	exec	-ti	-u	0	jenkins	apt	clean root@docker:~	docker	exec	-ti	-u	0	jenkins	apt	update root@docker:~	docker	exec	-ti	-u	0	jenkins	apt	install	python python-pip	-y The	parameter	-u	is	new	for	us.	It	says	to	the	Docker	for	which	user	we	need	to run	the	commands.	In	our	case,	the	user	represented	by	the	UID	0,	is	the	user root,	the	Jenkins	default	image.	Therefore,	the	default	user	is	the	user	Jenkins. We	can	validate	it	using	the	following	commands: root@docker:~	docker	exec-ti	jenkins	whoami jenkins root@docker:~	docker	exec-ti	jenkins	id uid=1000 jenkins 	gid=1000 jenkins 	groups=1000 jenkins  Going	back	to	the	pipeline	topic,	now,	we	need	to	replace	the	echo	statements	in the	stages	for	the	real	commands	which	will	be	used.	Then,	the	pipeline	should be	as	follows: pipeline	{  agent	any; stages	{  steps	{  stage 'Preparing	the	environment' 	{  sh	'python	-m	pip	install	-r	requirements.txt'  } stage 'Code	Quality' 	{  steps	{  sh	'python	-m	pylint	app.py'  }  }   } stage 'Tests' 	{  steps	{  sh	'python	-m	pytest'  } stage 'Build' 	{  steps	{  sh	'exit	1'  } stage 'Delivery' 	{  steps	{  sh	'exit	1'  } stage 'Deploy' 	{  steps	{  sh	'exit	1'  }  }  }  }  }  }  } Make	sure	that	everything	is	within	your	repository,	like	mine.	You	can	check using	the	following	link: https:  github.com AlissonMMenezes Chapter10 Run	 your	 pipeline	 manually.	 For	 now,	 we	 cannot	 trigger	 it	 automatically, because	 the	 Jenkins	 installation	 is	 local,	 and	 the	 GitHub	 is	 in	 the	 Cloud. However,	we	will	see	that	in	the	next	chapters. In	 order	 http:  192.168.33.11:8080 :  the	 pipeline	 manually,	 you	 can	 open	 a	 new	  to	 run	  tab:  Figure	10.11   Click	on	the	Run	button,	by	side	of	the	star.	In	your	first	attempt,	it	will	raise	the following	error:  Figure	10.12  This	error	means	the	code	is	not	following	the	code	quality	standards	defined	by the	pylint.	So,	we	need	to	fix	it	in	order	to	go	to	the	next	stage	of	the	pipeline. Fixing	it	is	simple.	There	is	a	module,	called	autopep8,	which	can	fix	the	code automatically	for	you.	To	install	it,	use	the	following	command:  python	-m	pip	install	autopep8 PEP8	is	a	set	of	best	practices	for	your	Python	code.

Remember	that	we	refactored	the	code,	and then,	we	need	to	change	our	tests	as	well.	In	the	test	source	code,	we	just	need	to change	the	following	part: @pytest.fixture def	client  :  APP.config['TESTING']	=	True client	=	APP.test_client    yield	client  We	are	ready	to	run	the	pipeline	again.	Let's	see	how	is	the	new	behavior:   Figure	10.13  Now	it	is	perfect!	We	passed	the	code	quality	check,	the	functional	tests,	and	we are	blocked	at	the	build	step.	It	makes	sense,	because	I	coded	it	to	run	an	exit	1. For	 that	 step,	 we	 need	 to	 generate	 a	 new	 Docker	 image.	 With	 our	 application inside,	deploy	it	in	the	same	server	that	we	are	running	our	Jenkins	container. In	order	to	do	it,	we	can	set	up	the	VM	as	a	Jenkins	node.	The	address	you	must access	to	add	a	new	node	is	as	follows: http:  192.168.33.11:8080 computer new I	will	call	that	node	as	Docker	server.	The	remote	root	directory	must	be	 tmp, and	the	Labels	Docker	server	as	well.	The	Launch	method	must	by	the	agent, connect	to	the	master.	Then,	we	will	install	the	agent	within	the	VM	and	it	will be	responsible	to	run	the	next	steps	of	the	pipeline:   Figure	10.14  After	configuring	and	saving	the	configuration,	the	Jenkins	will	make	the	agent available	for	you: http:  192.168.33.11:8080 computer DockerServer   Figure	10.15 We	can	just	copy	and	paste	the	line	in	the	VM: root@docker:~	apt	install	openjdk-8-jre-headless	-y root@docker:~	wget	http:  192.168.33.11:8080 jnlpJars agent.jar  root@docker:~	java	-jar	agent.jar	-jnlpUrl http:  192.168.33.11:8080 computer DockerServer slave-agent.jnlp	- secret 1309b876151399817cab2ef0da0ea34716ecbc01a44b38a95c93fdd748d72629	- workDir	" tmp" INFO:	Agent	discovery	successful Agent	address:	192.168.33.11 Agent	port:			50000 Identity:				52:84:5b:cb:ed:f7:98:4c:da:b2:64:66:48:de:cf:be Jun	10,	2020	12:46:41	PM	hudson.remoting.jnlp.Main$CuiListener status INFO:	Handshaking Jun	10,	2020	12:46:41	PM	hudson.remoting.jnlp.Main$CuiListener status INFO:	Connecting	to	192.168.33.11:50000 Jun	10,	2020	12:46:41	PM	hudson.remoting.jnlp.Main$CuiListener status INFO:	Trying	protocol:	JNLP4-connect Jun	10,	2020	12:46:42	PM	hudson.remoting.jnlp.Main$CuiListener   status INFO:	Remote	identity	confirmed: 52:84:5b:cb:ed:f7:98:4c:da:b2:64:66:48:de:cf:be Jun	10,	2020	12:46:43	PM	hudson.remoting.jnlp.Main$CuiListener status INFO:	Connected The	agent	is	successfully	connected.	Now,	we	can	continue	to	code	the	pipeline and	finish	the	application	deployment: pipeline	{  agent	any; stages	{  steps	{  stage 'Preparing	the	environment' 	{  sh	'python	-m	pip	install	-r	requirements.txt'  } stage 'Code	Quality' 	{  steps	{  sh	'python	-m	pylint	app.py'  } stage 'Tests' 	{  steps	{  sh	'python	-m	pytest'  stage 'Build' 	{  label	"DockerServer";  }  }  }  }  }  }  agent	{ node{  }  } steps	{  agent	{ node{  }  }  stage 'Deploy' 	{  label	"DockerServer";  sh	'docker	build https:  github.com AlissonMMenezes Chapter10.git	-t chapter10:latest'   sh	'docker	run	-tdi	-p	5000:5000	chapter10:latest'  steps	{  }  }  }  } This	is	the	latest	version	of	the	pipeline.	Let's	run	it	and	see	if	it	will	work:  Figure	10.16  Great!	Now	we	have	a	fully	functional	pipeline,	versioned	with	an	application, running	tests,	code	quality,	and	also	Dockerized.  Conclusion We	just	learned	how	to	create	a	pipeline	as	code	using	Jenkins,	run	code	quality checks,	functional	tests,	create	an	image	based	on	a	functional	application,	and deploy	it	on	the	top	of	a	Docker	server. We	could	see	that	it	is	not	an	extremely	hard	task.	Of	course,	as	complex	as	is your	 project,	 more	 complex	 will	 be	 your	 pipeline.	 For	 example,	 in	 the	 initial steps,	we	were	able	to	run	everything	on	Jenkins	by	itself.	By	the	final	steps,	we had	to	add	a	node	and	run	on	top	of	it.	We	also	learned	new	information	about Docker,	for	example,	some	parameters	to	start	the	container	every	time	that	the server	has	started.	It	is	also	possible	to	build	an	image	using	a	Dockerfile	hosted directly	in	a	remote	repository. I	 am	 pretty	 sure	 this	 introduction	 will	 give	 you	 the	 start	 for	 creating	 your pipelines	which	will	fit	perfectly	with	your	projects.   Questions  1.	 What	are	the	benefits	of	using	pipelines? 2.	 What	are	CI	and	CD? 3.	 Why	is	it	a	good	practice	to	use	the	pipeline	as	a	code? 4.	 What	benefits	can	we	have	from	the	BlueOcean	plugin? 5.	 When	are	the	Jenkins	nodes	needed?   CHAPTER	11 Deploying	and	Scaling	Your	Application Using	Kubernetes  T  his	 chapter	 aims	 to	 introduce	 you	 to	 Kubernetes,	 showing	 how	 to	 create YAML	files	to	deploy,	and	scale	your	applications	with	the	most	popular  and	reliable	container	orchestration	tool.  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  Kubernetes Introduction	to	Kubernetes Deploying	on	Cloud  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Know	about	Kubernetes Explain	the	benefits	of	Kubernetes Create	YAML	files	to	deploy	your	application Test	your	application	running	in	the	cluster  Kubernetes Kubernetes	is	a	container	orchestration	tool.	In	the	previous	chapters,	we	have been	 using	 Docker	 a	 lot	 for	 deploying	 applications,	 creating	 new	 images,	 etc. However,	imagine	if	you	have	more	than	one	hundred	containers	to	manage.	It	is an	 impossible	 task	 for	 just	 one	 guy.	 The	 Docker,	 by	 itself,	 has	 the	 Docker Swarm,	which	helps	you	with	that	task.	But,	it	is	not	commonly	adopted	by	the market,	 since	 it	 misses	 some	 features	 and	 integrations	 that	 we	 have	 on Kubernetes.	It	was	created	by	Google	some	years	ago,	based	on	a	project,	called   Borg,	which	was	also	a	container	orchestration	tool.	With	the	release	of	Docker, that	project	was	adapted	to	use	it,	and	now	it	has	become	the	official	platform	to manage	your	cluster.  Introduction	to	Kubernetes Like	the	other	chapters,	our	focus	is	always	on	how	to	implement	it	in	the	real- world.	Let's	have	a	short	introduction	of	how	we	can	setup	our	local	environment to	learn	Kubernetes,	and	then,	we	can	setup	a	real	environment	and	deploy	an application.	 You	 will	 see	 that	 the	 commands	 are	 same	 when	 we	 run	 it	 in	 our local	environment	and	on	the	Cloud	environment. First	 of	 all,	 we	 will	 install	 minikube.	 It	 is	 a	 tool	 to	 set	 up	 a	 local	 Kubernetes environment	on	the	top	of	a	Virtual	Box,	like	we	have	been	doing	along	with	the book: wget https:  github.com kubernetes minikube releases download v1.11.0 minikube- windows-amd64.exe	-O	minikube.exe If	 you	 are	 using	 another	 OS,	 you	 can	 follow	 the	 official	 documentation: https:  kubernetes.io docs tasks tools install-minikube  Then,	we	can	start	the	cluster: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\minikube.exe	start *	minikube	v1.11.0	on	Microsoft	Windows	10	Pro	10.0.19041	Build 19041 *	Automatically	selected	the	virtualbox	driver *	Downloading	VM	boot	image	… *	Starting	control	plane	node	minikube	in	cluster	minikube *	Downloading	Kubernetes	v1.18.3	preload	… *	Creating	virtualbox	VM	 CPUs=2,	Memory=6000MB,	Disk=20000MB 	… *	Preparing	Kubernetes	v1.18.3	on	Docker	19.03.8	… *	Verifying	Kubernetes	components… *	Enabled	addons:	default-storageclass,	storage-provisioner *	Done!	kubectl	is	now	configured	to	use	"minikube" We	also	need	to	install	the	 kubectl,	a	command	which	we	will	use	to	manage your	cluster,	for	 dev,	 stg,	and	 prd.	If	you	are	using	another	operating	system, you	 documentation: official	 https:  kubernetes.io docs tasks tools install-minikube  PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	wget https:  storage.googleapis.com kubernetes- release release v1.18.3 bin linux amd64 kubectl	-O	kubectl.exe  follow	  can	  the	   To	begin	with,	we	can	run	a	simple	command	to	see	how	many	clusters	we	have configured	in	our	environment: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	config	get-clusters NAME Minikube For	now,	it	is	just	the	minikube.	But	we	will	have	more,	one	important	thing	to know	is	where	the	kubectl	get	this	informationfrom: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>cat	'C:\Users\1511	MXTI\.kube\config' After	the	minikube	installs	the	k8s	cluster,	it	configures	within	the	config	file, inside	 of	 .kube	 folder	 which	 is	 located	 in	 your	 home	 directory.	 All	 the authenticate	 information	 is	 located	 within	 that	 file.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 know everything	running	inside	your	cluster,	you	can	run	the	following	command:  I	 used	 the	 parameter	 to	 get	 pods,	 and	 another	 parameter	 –all-namespaces.	 It shows	us	all	the	running	containers	in	the	cluster	among	all	the	namespaces.	For now,	 we	 just	 have	 one,	 called	 kube-system.	 Before	 we	 move	 on	 with	 more commands,	it	is	important	to	understand	pod,	namespace,	and	not	just	it.  POD:	It	represents	a	set	of	one	or	more	containers	running.   NAMESPACE:	 It	 is	 the	 logical	 separation	 among	 the	 objects.	 For example,	in	the	same	cluster	I	can	have,	 dev	 –	 stg	 –	 prd,	namespaces, each	one	running	on	different	versions	of	the	same	application,	or	it	could be,	project1,	project2,	and	project3.	You	can	divide	your	cluster	in	as many	namespaces	as	you	want. SERVICE:	This	is	a	resource	which	you	will	use	to	connect	the	external world	with	your	pods.	If	you	remember	the	Docker	chapter,	we	had	to	map the	 host	 port	 8080	 to	 the	 container	 port	 8080.	 But	 it	 was	 for	 only	 one container.	 On	 Kubernetes,	 we	 have	 a	 POD	 which	 can	 have	 one	 or	 more containers	that	can	be	destroyed	and	recreated	at	any	time.	However,	we cannot	lose	the	port	mapping,	that	is,	the	SERVICE	job,	where	we	configure a	NODE	Port,	which	will	redirect	to	a	POD	port,	exactly	in	the	same	way	we did	with	Docker.	It	was	one	of	the	usages	of	the	services,	but,	we	can	also have	other	implementations,	like	a	load	balancer,	which	has	a	 clusterIP that	will	receive	the	incoming	connections	and	forward	it	to	the	containers. DEPLOYMENT:	It	is	a	set	of	rules	to	make	sure	that	you	have	a	specific number	 of	 running	 containers.	 All	 the	 containers	 are	 running	 the	 same image,	and	if	any	container	dies,	it	will	be	recreated.	In	other	words,	it	will create	 your	 PODs	 automatically,	 and	 the	 REPLICASET	 will	 ensure	 the running	containers. INGRESS:	This	resource	can	be	compared	to	a	Virtual	Host,	like	we	did in	 the	 Apache	 chapter.	 Here,	 we	 will	 have	 a	 NAME,	 which	 will	 point	 to SERVICE,	 which	 will	 point	 to	 a	 POD.	 If	 you	 are	 not	 using	 a	 DNS,	 the INGRESS	is	not	mandatory.  The	aforementioned	items	are	called	the	Kubernetes	objects.	There	are	so	many more	objects	that	we	can	explore	to	understand	more	about	Kubernetes,	but	we could	 write	 a	 whole	 book	 just	 explaining	 it.	 For	 now,	 I	 think	 it	 is	 enough	 to deploy	 some	 micro-services	 at	 last.	 If	 you	 are	 deploying	 stateful	 applications, you	will	probably	have	to	extend	your	reading	to	VOLUMES. So,	now	we	can	create	the	first	NAMESPACE	and	start	to	play	around	some	objects: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	create	namespace	chapter11 namespace chapter11	created PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>	.\kubectl.exe	get	ns NAME														STATUS			AGE chapter11									Active			11s default											Active			38m kube-node-lease			Active			38m kube-public							Active			38m   kube-system							Active			38m Notice	that	we	can	use	the	full	form	of	the	parameters,	and	also	the	short	form, like,	when	I	listed	the	namespaces,	I	used	just	the	ns. The	INGRESS	is	a	separate	resource	from	Kubernetes.	When	you	are	using	it	on the	 Cloud,	 some	 give	 it	 to	 you	 already	 installed.	 But,	 in	 an	 on-premises environment,	 you	 usually	 have	 to	 install.	 For	 our	 local	 environment,	 we	 will have	to	install	it	using	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\minikube.exe	addons	enable	ingress *	The	'ingress'	addon	is	enabled To	run	your	first	application	in	the	cluster,	run	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\minikube.exe	addons	enable	ingress PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	--namespace=chapter11	run python	-dti	--port=8080	--image=alissonmenezes python:latest	-l app=python This	command	will	download	the	 python_app:v1	from	my	personal	repository alissonmenezes	 and	 expose	 the	 port	 8080.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 check	 if	 the	 pod	 is running,	you	can	use	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>kubectl	get	pods	--namespace=chapter11 NAME					READY			STATUS				RESTARTS			AGE python			1 1					Running			1										6m43s Now	we	have	one	pod	running	with	one	container	in	it.	However,	we	want	to access	the	application,	but	at	this	moment	it	is	available	only	inside	the	cluster. The	other	applications	inside	the	cluster	are	already	capable	of	accessing	it,	but for	us,	from	the	outside,	we	will	have	to	create	a	service	for	it: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	--namespace=chapter11	create service	clusterip	python	--tcp=80:8080 service python	created We	just	created	the	 SERVICE	with	 clusterip	type.	It	does	not	expose	the	 NODE port,	and	we	need	the	ingress	to	make	the	mapping	from	the	outside	to	the	inside of	the	cluster.	Create	a	file	called	app.yaml	with	the	following	content: apiVersion:	extensions v1beta1 kind:	Ingress metadata:  name:	python namespace:	chapter11 annotations:   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io rewrite-target:	   spec:  backend:  serviceName:	python servicePort:	80  The	 INGRESS	 is	 composed	 of	 Nginx	 server,	 which	 we	 call	 the	 “Ingress Controller”.	It	is	basically	doing	a	proxy	pass	of	the	incoming	connections	from any	addresses	or	names	being	forwarded	to	a	service,	called	Python. To	apply	the	file,	you	must	use	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	apply	-f	.\app.yaml ingress.extensions python	created To	get	the	minikube	IP	address,	run	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\minikube	ip 192.168.99.101 If	you	type	this	address	on	your	web	browser,	you	must	see	the	following	page:  Figure	11.1  The	application	is	running! We	 have	 successfully	 created	 everything	 using	 the	 commands	 and	 just	 the Ingress	using	a	YAML	file.	However,	it	is	possible	to	create	everything	just	using the	files	that	are	the	most	used	way	to	deploy	everything	on	Kubernetes,	because we	 can	 version	 the	 files	 and	 run	 it	 on	 the	 pipeline	 as	 we	 did	 in	 the	 previous   chapter. We	can	create	everything	in	one	file	as	follows: --- apiVersion:	apps v1 kind:	Deployment metadata:  image:	alissonmenezes python:latest  ports:  -	containerPort:	8080  name:	python namespace:	chapter11 labels:  app:	python  spec:  replicas:	1 selector:  matchLabels: app:	python  template:  metadata: labels:  app:	python  spec:  containers:  -	name:	python  --- apiVersion:	v1 kind:	Service metadata: labels:  app:	python name:	python namespace:	chapter11  spec:  ports: -	name:	http  port:	80 protocol:	TCP targetPort:	8080  selector:  app:	python type:	ClusterIP  --- apiVersion:	extensions v1beta1 kind:	Ingress   metadata:  name:	python labels:  app:	python namespace:	chapter11  annotations:  spec:  backend:  serviceName:	python servicePort:	80  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io rewrite-target:	   To	make	sure	that	everything	will	run	properly,	you	can	delete	everything: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	delete	all	-l	app=python	--all- namespaces pod	"python-779879dbb6-w57pr"	deleted Apply	the	file	with	the	whole	content: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	apply	-f	.\app.yaml deployment.apps python	created service python	created ingress.extensions python	unchanged Now,	you	already	know	the	basics.	Let's	see	it	deploying	in	a	real	environment.  Deploying	on	Cloud In	order	to	deploy	on	the	Cloud,	we	will	use	exactly	the	same	app.yaml	that	we have	been	using	until	now.	But	firstly,	we	need	to	create	the	Kubernetes	cluster. I	will	use	the	GCP	for	it. I	have	created	a	project,	called	chapter11,	where	I	will	provision	the	cluster: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>gcloud	config	set	project	chapter11-280417 Updated	property	[core project]. Define	where	the	compute	nodes	will	be	created: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>gcloud	config	set	compute zone	us-central1-c Updated	property	[compute zone]. Define	where	the	compute	nodes	will	be	created: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>gcloud	container	clusters	create	chapter11	-- num-nodes=1 NAME							LOCATION						   MASTER_VERSION		MASTER_IP						MACHINE_TYPE		 NODE_VERSION				NUM_NODES		STATUS chapter11		us-central1-c		1.14.10-gke.36		35.193.191.37		n1- standard-1		1.14.10-gke.36		1										RUNNING Once	the	cluster	is	running,	we	need	to	login	into	the	cluster	using	the	following command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>gcloud	container	clusters	get-credentials chapter11 Fetching	cluster	endpoint	and	auth	data. kubeconfig	entry	generated	for	chapter11. And	 just	 like	 that,	 everything	 is	 perfect.	 Now,	 we	 can	 work	 exactly	 as	 we worked	with	minikube: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	config	get-clusters NAME minikube gke_chapter11-280417_us-central1-c_chapter11 By	 running	 the	 same	 command,	 we	 can	 see	 that	 we	 have	 another	 cluster configured,	 called	 gke_chapter11.	 When	 we	 ran	 the	 command	 get- credentials,	the	gke	was	set	by	default,	and	now,	we	do	not	need	to	think	about running	the	commands	in	one	cluster	or	another. We	also	can	check	what	is	running	with	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	get	pods	--all-namespaces NAMESPACE				 NAME																																																							READY		 STATUS				RESTARTS			AGE kube-system			event-exporter-v0.2.5-599d65f456- v2h9f																					2 2					Running			0										4m50s kube-system			fluentd-gcp-scaler-bfd6cf8dd- c4b6c																									1 1					Running			0										4m42s kube-system			fluentd-gcp-v3.1.1- pj6pp																																			2 2					Running		 0										3m51s kube-system			heapster-gke-7bff5f7474- 9vgtb																														3 3					Running		 0										3m42s kube-system			kube-dns-5995c95f64- 742kn																																		4 4					Running		 0										4m53s kube-system			kube-dns-autoscaler-8687c64fc- w7w2d																								1 1					Running			0										4m41s kube-system			kube-proxy-gke-chapter11-default-pool-e3952147-   h0gc								1 1					Running			0										4m41s kube-system			l7-default-backend-8f479dd9- tpmk6																										1 1					Running			0										4m53s kube-system			metrics-server-v0.3.1-5c6fbf777- 4xmlf																						2 2					Running			0										4m5s kube-system			prometheus-to-sd- 692dh																																					2 2					Running		 0										4m41s kube-system			stackdriver-metadata-agent-cluster-level-79974b544- 8n5gg			2 2					Running			0										3m58s There	 are	 so	 many	 more	 pods	 running.	 If	 we	 compare	 with	 minikube,	 one example	is	the	stackdriver,	which	is	the	Google	tool	to	retrieve	the	logs	from your	cluster.	Let's	create	the	namespace: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI>.\kubectl.exe	create	namespace	chapter11 namespace chapter11	created In	the	case	of	Google	Kubernetes	Engine,	they	have	a	Load	Balancer	as	a	service and	it	can	be	attached	to	our	Kuberntes	SERVICE.	Thus,	the	service	will	have	an external	address,	and	we	can	point	the	DNS	directly	to	it.	In	this	case,	we	do	not need	the	Ingress.	Therefore,	let's	change	this: apiVersion:	apps v1 kind:	Deployment metadata:  name:	python namespace:	chapter11 labels:  app:	python  spec:  replicas:	1 selector:  matchLabels: app:	python  template:  metadata: labels:  app:	python  spec:  containers: -	name:	python  image:	alissonmenezes python:latest  ports:  -	containerPort:	8080  As	you	can	see	the	last	line	from	the	service	part.

It	was	a	very	short introduction.	As	I	mentioned	earlier,	it	is	possible	to	write	an	entire	book	about Kubernetes.	The	goal	here	is	just	to	deploy	an	application	as	an	example	and	see how	it	works	in	your	local	environment	and	on	the	cloud	using	GKE. I	recommend	you	to	read	more	about	Kubernetes	and	Istio.	You	will	discover amazing	things,	like	fine-grain	routes,	A B	tests,	canary	deployment,	going	deep into	the	deployment	strategies,	and	so	much	more. I	have	a	post	in	my	personal	blog	giving	a	short	introduction	to	Istio.	You	can translate	the	page	using	Google	Chrome	and	see	what	we	are	doing. https:  alissonmachado.com.br istio-e-minikube-teste-a-b   Questions  1.	 What	is	the	tool	used	to	orchestrate	a	large	number	of	containers? 2.	 What	 is	 the	 name	 of	 the	 Kubernetes	 object	 to	 map	 a	 node	 port	 to	 a  container	port?  3.	 What	is	the	Kubernetes	object	that	represents	one	or	more	containers? 4.	 What	is	the	Kubernetes	command	to	apply	a	YAML	file? 5.	 What	does	Ingress	do?   CHAPTER	12 Logs	with	Open-Source	Tools  T  visualize	in	a	dashboard.  his	chapter	aims	to	introduce	you	to	the	EFK	stack,	showing	how	you	can retrieve	 the	 application	 logs,	 send	 them	 to	 a	 centralized	 server,	 and  Structure In	this	chapter,	we	will	discuss	the	following	topics:  EFK	stack Setup	the	EFK	stack Shipping	and	centralizing	logs	with	Fluentd	and	Elasticsearch Visualizing	logs	with	Kibana  Objectives After	studying	this	unit,	you	should	be	able	to:  Know	about	EFK	stack Send	logs	to	an	elasticsearch	using	Fluentd Search	for	the	logs	using	Kibana Create	alerts  EFK Elasticsearch,	Fluentd,	and	Kibana;	this	stack	is	famous	around	the	Kubernetes environments.	 Often,	 we	 can	 see	 a	 DaemonSet	 of	 FluentD	 running	 on	 all	 the nodes	retrieving	the	logs	and	sending	them	to	an	Elasticsearch	Server	which	will index	the	logs	and	parse	them,	thus,	making	it	easy	to	search	the	specific	events based	on	your	criteria.	Kibana	is	the	web	interface	that	can	be	connected	to	an elasticsearch	in	order	to	visualize	the	data.	Otherwise,	we	would	have	to	make requests	 to	 the	 elasticsearch	 API.	 Kibana	 also	 gives	 us	 many	 features,	 like   creating	graphics	based	on	logs.	Thus,	we	can	create	visualizations	of	how	many errors	the	application	raised	in	the	last	two	hours.	Or,	in	another	example,	we could	 count	 the	 HTTP	 status	 codes	 and	 order	 them	 based	 on	 the	 number	 of requests.	 40	 requests	 returned	 status	 400,	 500	 requests	 return	 status	 200,	 10 requests	returned	status	500,	etc.  Setup	the	EFK	Stack We	will	have	the	following	scenario;	we	are	going	to	set	up	the	elastichsearch and	Kibana	in	a	virtual	machine	using	Vagrant	and	the	Fluentd	will	run	within our	minikube	cluster	to	ship	the	logs	from	the	running	applications	to	the	remote server,	and	we	will	visualize	it	in	a	centralized	way. The	Vagrant	file	is	as	follows: 	-*-	mode:	ruby	-*- 	vi:	set	ft=ruby	:  	All	Vagrant	configuration	is	done	below.	The	"2"	in Vagrant.configure 	configures	the	configuration	version	 we	support	older	styles	for 	backwards	compatibility .	Please	don't	change	it	unless	you	know what 	you're	doing.

First,	enable the	elasticsearch	to	listen	to	all	the	addresses	by	the	following	command:  sed	-i	"s network.host:	192.168.0.1 network.host:	0.0.0.0 g"  etc Elasticsearch Elasticsearch.yml Second,	change	the	seed	hosts	by	the	following	command:  sed	-i	"s discovery.seed_hosts:	\[\"host1\", \"host2\"\] discovery.seed_hosts:	\[\] g"  etc Elasticsearch Elasticsearch.yml Third,	you	must	define	that	it	is	a	single	node	cluster	by	the	following	command:  echo	"discovery.type:	single-node">>  etc Elasticsearch Elasticsearch.yml Fourth,	change	the	Kibana	configuration	to	listen	to	all	the	addresses	as	well	by the	following	command:  sed	-i	"s server.host:	\"localhost\" server.host:	\"0.0.0.0\" g"  etc kibana kibana.yml Then,	you	can	restart	the	services	by	running	the	following	command: root@efk:~	 etc init.d kibanarestart d Elasticsearch	start kibana	started root@efk:~	 etc init.d Elasticsearchstart [….]	Starting	Elasticsearch	 via	systemctl :	Elasticsearch.service If	 you	 did	 all	 the	 steps	 correctly,	 you	 can	 check	 the	 service	 ports	 using	 the command	ss	–ntpl:   Figure	12.1  The	Kibana	is	running	on	port	5601.	Now,	you	can	use	the	following	address	to check	the	interface. http:  192.168.99.50:5601  Figure	12.2  The	server	takes	a	while	to	start.	If	it	takes	about	10	minutes,	do	not	worry. At	this	moment,	we	do	not	have	to	do	anything	else	in	this	server,	so,	let's	go	to the	minikube	and	run	the	FluentD	to	ship	the	logs.	After	that,	we	will	come	back to	the	Kibana	server	and	see	the	logs.  Running	Fluentd First	of	all,	let's	setup	the	minikube	environment	with	the	following	command:   PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Documents\Blog\EKF>	minikube	delete *	Deleting	"minikube"	in	virtualbox	… *	Removed	all	traces	of	the	"minikube"	cluster.

With	the	Kubernetes	environment running,	we	will	set	up	the	DaemonSet	using	the	following	file: apiVersion:	apps v1 kind:	DaemonSet metadata:  name:	fluentd namespace:	kube-system labels:  k8s-app:	fluentd-logging version:	v1  spec:  selector:  matchLabels:  name:	fluentd  template:  metadata: labels:  name:	fluentd k8s-app:	fluentd-logging version:	v1 kubernetes.io cluster-service:	"true"  spec:  containers:  -	name:	fluentd  image:	fluent fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset:v1-debian- Elasticsearch  env:  -	name:	FLUENT_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST 		value:	"192.168.99.50" -	name:	FLUENT_ELASTICSEARCH_SSL_VERIFY   		value:	"false" -	name:	FLUENT_ELASTICSEARCH_PORT 		value:	"9200" -	name:	FLUENT_ELASTICSEARCH_SCHEME 		value:	"http" -	name:	FLUENT_UID 		value:	"0" -	name:	FLUENT_LOGSTASH_FORMAT 		value:	"true" -	name:	FLUENT_LOGSTASH_PREFIX 		value:	"fluentd" -	name:	FLUENTD_SYSTEMD_CONF 		value:	"disable"  resources:  limits:  memory:	200Mi requests:  cpu:	100m memory:	200Mi  volumeMounts:  -	name:	varlog mountPath:	 var log -	name:	varlibdockercontainers mountPath:	 var lib docker containers readOnly:	true terminationGracePeriodSeconds:	30  volumes:  -	name:	varlog  hostPath: path:	 var log  -	name:	varlibdockercontainers  hostPath:  path:	 var lib docker containers  DaemonSet:	It	is	a	Kubernetes	object	which	is	responsible	to	run	the	same	pod	on every	node	of	the	cluster.	The	difference	between	a	normal	pod	and	a	DaemonSet is	that	a	pod	is	mandatory	on	every	node,	if	you	are	deploying	an	application,	not necessary	you	have	to	run	the	application	on	all	nodes: kubectl	apply	-f	.\fluentd.yaml daemonset.apps fluentd	configured The	preceding	command	will	run	the	DaemonSet	in	your	cluster.	To	check	if	it	is running,	you	can	run	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\DataLake>	kubectl	get	daemonset	-n	kube- system NAME									DESIRED			CURRENT			READY			UP-TO-DATE			AVAILABLE		   NODE	SELECTOR												AGE fluentd						1									1									1							1												1										  																			7m26s kube-proxy			1									1									1							1												1										 kubernetes.io os=linux			13h It	is	important	to	check	the	logs,	because	starting	from	now,	the	logs	must	be sent	to	the	elasticsearch	server: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\DataLake>	kubectl	logs		daemonset fluentd	-n kube-system  Visualizing	the	Logs Now,	 we	 can	 go	 back	 to	 the	 Kibana	 dashboard,	 because	 the	 logs	 must	 have already	 been	 shipped	 to	 the	 server.	 The	 next	 goal	 is	 to	 visualize	 them.	 In	 the initial	page,	click	on	the	option	Explore	on	my	own.	Then,	click	on	the	top	left and	discover	the	logs:  Figure	12.3  Now,	we	can	create	an	index	that	matches	with	all	the	logs	stored.	We	can	do that	once	that	cluster	is	used	only	for	this	Kubernetes	environment.	If	you	will use	the	same	elasticsearch	for	all	the	logs	of	the	company,	it	would	be	better	to create	different	indexes	for	each	case:   We	must	define	the	Index	Pattern	as	*,	which	will	get	all	the	logs:  Figure	12.4  Figure	12.5  You	can	select	the	time	filter	as	a	timestamp.	If	we	go	again	to	the	discovery	part and	 select	 logs	 from	 3	 months	 ago,	 we	 will	 be	 able	 to	 see	 that	 the	 logs	 are already	in	the	Elasticsearch.	Of	course,	we	do	not	need	to	put	3	months	ago,	but I	just	wanted	to	make	sure	that	we	will	see	all	the	present	logs:   Figure	12.6  If	you	look	on	the	left	side,	you	can	find	some	Kubernetes	elements.	You	can play	around	that	because,	now,	we	do	not	need	to	access	the	Kubernetes	cluster to	access	the	logs. Let's	deploy	an	application	and	see	how	we	can	check	the	logs:  Kubectl	create	ns	chapter11 Create	a	namespace,	called	Chapter11:	Deploying	and	Scaling	your	Application using	 Kubernetes,	 because	 we	 will	 use	 the	 same	 application	 used	 in	 the	 last chapter.	The	yaml	file	for	the	application	is	as	follows: apiVersion:	apps v1 kind:	Deployment metadata:  name:	python namespace:	chapter11 labels:  app:	python  spec:  replicas:	1 selector:  matchLabels: app:	python  template: metadata: labels:  app:	python  spec:  containers: -	name:	python  image:	alissonmenezes python:latest   ports:  -	containerPort:	8080  namespace:	chapter11  --- apiVersion:	v1 kind:	Service metadata: labels:  app:	python name:	python  spec:  ports: -	name:	http  port:	80 protocol:	TCP targetPort:	8080  selector:  app:	python  type:	ClusterIP  --- apiVersion:	extensions v1beta1 kind:	Ingress metadata:  name:	python labels:  app:	python namespace:	chapter11  annotations:  spec:  backend:  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io rewrite-target:	   serviceName:	python servicePort:	80	Run	the	following	command	now:  PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\Documents\Blog\EKF>	minikube.exe	ip 192.168.99.102 The	Kubernetes	IP	is	192.168.99.102.	We	will	use	it	to	access	the	application. Make	sure	that	you	have	enabled	the	ingress	with	the	following	command: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\DataLake>	minikube.exe	addons	enable	ingress *	The	'ingress'	addon	is	enabled If	we	access	the	application	on	the	browser,	we	will	see	the	following	page:   Figure	12.7  If	we	go	to	the	applications	logs	on	Kubernetes,	we	can	see	the	following: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\DataLake>	kubectl	logs	deploy python	-n chapter11 *	Running	on	http:  0.0.0.0:8080 	 Press	CTRL+C	to	quit  *	Restarting	with	stat *	Debugger	is	active! *	Debugger	PIN:	954-738-244 172.17.0.6	-	-	[28 Jun 2020	10:22:16]	"GET	 	HTTP 1.1"	200	- 172.17.0.6	-	-	[28 Jun 2020	10:22:17]	"GET	 favicon.ico	HTTP 1.1" 404	- 172.17.0.6	-	-	[28 Jun 2020	10:22:18]	"GET	 	HTTP 1.1"	200	- 172.17.0.6	-	-	[28 Jun 2020	10:22:18]	"GET	 	HTTP 1.1"	200	- It	means	that	we	generated	some	logs,	and	then	we	can	see	those	on	the	Kibana. Let's	give	a	look.	First,	we	need	the	pod	name: PS	C:\Users\1511	MXTI\DataLake>	kubectl	get	pods	-n	chapter11 NAME																						READY			STATUS				RESTARTS			AGE python-779879dbb6-wrw2g			1 1					Running			0										44m And	the	query	on	Kibana	will	be	like	this: kubernetes.pod_name:python-779879dbb6-wrw2g The	syntax	is:	key	:	value.	Then,	the	first	parameter	is	the	respective	element that	you	want	to	filter.	The	colon,	 :	,	represents	the	equal	and	in	the	end,	you have	the	value	used	as	a	criteria. The	Kibana	page	you	will	see	will	be	like	the	following	screenshot:   Let's	analyze	the	log	because	we	have	an	important	information	to	check:  Figure	12.8  Figure	12.9  Pay	attention,	the	pod_name	matches	with	the	criteria,	and	the	log	has	the	logline that	 we	 saw	 on	 the	 Kubernetes.	 Now,	 we	 are	 sure	 that	 the	 logs	 were	 sent	 to elasticsearch.	 We	 can	 visualize	 them	 on	 Kibana	 and	 now,	 we	 can	 create	 a specific	visualization	to	simplify	the	log	analysis.  Creating	alerts With	the	logs	within	the	elasticsearch	and	we	know	how	to	find	them,	let's	create some	 alerts	 which	 will	 notify	 us	 when	 an	 event	 happens.	 The	 event	 can	 be defined	by	you,	can	return	a	status	 404,	status	 500,	or	for	example,	part	of	an error	message. In	our	case,	every	time	that	someone	tries	to	access	a	non-existing	page,	it	will return	the	404	status	and	it	will	send	a	notification.	In	order	to	do	that,	we	will use	 a	 tool	 called	 ElastAlert.	 It	 is	 a	 tool	 in	 Python	 which	 will	 connect	 to	 our elasticsearch,	will	read	the	logs,	and	send	the	notifications. Within	the	EFK	stack,	let's	install	it. root@efk:~	apt	install	python3-pip	-y root@efk:~	python3	-m	pip	install	elastalert   Sometimes,	 we	 may	 face	 an	 issue	 because	 of	 the	 other	 modules	 version.	 The most	important	module	for	the	ElastAlert	is	the	PyYAML.	So,	let's	upgrade	it to	make	sure	that	we	are	using	the	latest	version: root@efk:~	python3	-m	pip	install	PyYAML	--upgrade Once	ElastAlert	is	installed,	we	need	to	connect	it	with	elasticsearch.	To	do	it, run	the	following	command: root@efk:~	elastalert-create-index Enter	Elasticsearch	host:	127.0.0.1 Enter	Elasticsearch	port:	9200 Use	SSL?	t f:	f Enter	optional	basic-auth	username	 or	leave	blank : Enter	optional	basic-auth	password	 or	leave	blank : Enter	optional	Elasticsearch	URL	prefix	 prepends	a	string	to	the URL	of	every	request : New	index	name?	 Default	elastalert_status  New	alias	name?	 Default	elastalert_alerts  Name	of	existing	index	to	copy?	 Default	None  Elastic	Version:	7.8.0 Reading	Elastic	6	index	mappings: Reading	index	mapping	'es_mappings 6 silence.json' Reading	index	mapping	'es_mappings 6 elastalert_status.json' Reading	index	mapping	'es_mappings 6 elastalert.json' Reading	index	mapping	'es_mappings 6 past_elastalert.json' Reading	index	mapping	'es_mappings 6 elastalert_error.json' New	index	elastalert_status	created Done! So,	 the	 next	 step	 is	 to	 create	 the	 config.yaml,	 which	 is	 the	 file	 where	 the elasticsearch	server	is	configured: root@efk:~	cat	config.yaml rules_folder:	rules  run_every: minutes:	1  buffer_time: minutes:	15  es_host:	127.0.0.1 es_port:	9200 writeback_index:	elastalert_status writeback_alias:	elastalert_alerts  alert_time_limit:   days:	2 Now,	we	need	to	create	a	rule.	The	ElastAlert	will	run	the	query	every	minute checking	 if	 we	 have	 the	 logs	 which	 match	 the	 criteria.	 Create	 a	 folder,	 called rules	with	the	following	command: root@efk:~	ls config.yaml		rules root@efk:~	mkdir	rules root@efk:~	pwd  root Within	the	rules	folder,	create	a	file,	called	 alert_404.yml	with	the	following content: es_host:	192.168.99.50 es_port:	9200 name:	Alerting	404 type:	frequency index:	"*" num_events:	1 timeframe: hours:	24 filter: -	query:  wildcard:  log:	"404"  alert:  -	slack:  I	 created	 a	 workspace	 on	 Slack,	 where	 I	 created	 a	 web	 hook.	 If	 you	 want	 to know	more	about	that,	you	can	check	the	documentation	later	on.	But,	for	now, the	most	important	thing	is	to	see	if	it	is	working.	So,	let's	run	the	ElastAlert with	the	following	command: root@efk:~	elastalert	--rule	rules alert_404.yml	--verbose 1	rules	loaded INFO:elastalert:Starting	up INFO:elastalert:Disabled	rules	are:	[] INFO:elastalert:Sleeping	for	9.999665	seconds Now,	you	can	try	to	access	a	non-existing	page,	like	the	following	screenshot:  slack_webhook_url: "https:  hooks.slack.com services T016B1J0J2J B0830S98KSL TAlTSxL2IhpCRyIVFOxdtVbZ"   Figure	12.10  This	access	should	generate	a	log	with	the	 404	status.	You	probably	saw	a	log like	this	on	ElastAlert: INFO:elastalert:Queried	rule	Alerting	404	from	2020-06-30	18:54	UTC to	2020-06-30	18:57	UTC:	2	 	2	hits INFO:elastalert:Ran	Alerting	404	from	2020-06-30	18:54	UTC	to	2020- 06-30	18:57	UTC:	2	query	hits	 2	already	seen ,	0	matches,	0	alerts sent INFO:elastalert:Background	configuration	change	check	run	at	2020- 06-30	18:57	UTC INFO:elastalert:Background	alerts	thread	0	pending	alerts	sent	at 2020-06-30	18:57	UTC It	means	that	our	alert	is	working	and	I	should	have	received	a	notification	on Slack:   Figure	12.11  As	you	saw	in	the	preceding	image,	I	received	the	notification	on	Slack	with	the logs	where	I	can	see	the	error	and	check	what	is	happening	with	the	application. Of	 course,	 you	 can	 explore	 more	 ElastAlert	 and	 configure	 different	 types	 of alerts,	using	email,	for	example.	However,	many	companies	now	are	changing from	email	to	Slack	or	similar	tools.	That	is	why,	I	used	it	as	an	example.  Conclusion This	chapter	was	a	short	explanation	of	how	we	can	set	up	an	environment	using the	EFK	stack	and	Kubernetes.	The	same	steps	work	on	Cloud	or	on-premises environments.	This	whole	chapter	aimed	to	show	you	a	short	explanation	about everything	 that	 is	 possible	 to	 do	 using	 the	 DevOps	 technologies.	 For	 each chapter,	we	could	have	written	a	whole	book.	However,	in	my	view,	it	is	very important	to	have	a	general	overview	about	different	topics,	because,	you	will	be able	to	think	what	is	possible	to	do	and	what	the	people	are	using	for	different cases.	And	after	that,	you	can	go	deep	in	each	one	of	the	solutions	represented here	or	find	their	alternatives.
