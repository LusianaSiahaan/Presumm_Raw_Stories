The ﬁrst was a long-overdue necessity: a cell phone to replace the battered but trusty companion that had been  bounced  off  a  few  too  many  rocks  and  hard  ﬂoors.  Actually  it  still worked ﬁne—the necessity had more to do with sparing the blushes of my off- spring when such a three-year-old “dinosaur” was taken out in public. OK, I’ll be  honest:  I  was  seduced  by  the  upgrade  model—a  3G  “smartphone”  with built-in  browser,  cameras   yes,  plural:  one  front  and  one  back,  believe  it  or not! ,  MP3  player,  FM  radio,  and  the  list  goes  on.  It  could  also  make  and receive calls, which was a relief.  Even  avowed  nongadget  types  admit  a  frisson  of  anticipation  when unpacking such a marvel. Sadly, the initial excitement soon evaporated to be replaced  by  disappointment  and  mounting  frustration—before  long  I  was looking  around  for  a  convenient  rock.  Yes,  the  phone  certainly  did  all  the things that it claimed to do, but it excelled at none of them. I may be particu- larly slow, but even making a call necessitated a quick glance at page 10 of the manual. The much-trumpeted accompanying software “suite” turned out to be a confusing hodgepodge of applications each with its own unique and inscrutable user interface. To top it all, the software was only for Windows— no mention of the Mac: it didn’t exist so far as this major manufacturer was concerned. Ruefully, I stuffed the lot back into its fancy box and returned it, having duly made my peace with my old phone.  A week or so later, and that feeling of anticipation is back as I’m extricat- ing an entirely different gadget from its packaging. No built-in camera this time; no browser, no FM radio, no Bluetooth—it can’t even make a phone  do are exe- call. But—as I soon discover—the few things that this device  cuted so superbly that it totally blows away my  already high  expectations. The  accompanying  software  is  fully  integrated  and  works  seamlessly  with the device. It can be installed on both Mac and Windows and works exactly the same on both. I’m talking about the latest video iPod, of course, and its companion software—iTunes 6.  can  xi                     xii  Preface  And the moral of this tale of two gadgets? Well, it should be obvious: if you nurture big ambitions for your gadget—or application or software tool— be  sure  to  focus  your  efforts  on  its  core  function  and  usability:  make  that outstanding ﬁrst and foremost—make it really shine.  QuickTime  QuickTime  is  the  success  that  it  is  today  precisely  because  Apple  has focused its efforts on making sure that QuickTime continues to deliver the very best media playback and creation technology, even as standards, plat- forms,  and  hardware  all  evolve.  And  shine  QuickTime  does,  not  only  on the Mac—where one would hardly expect less of Apple—but equally on the Windows platform, a fact that is often not fully appreciated nor admitted by Windows-oriented developers. It is no exaggeration to suggest that this unique  cross-platform  capability  of  QuickTime  has,  in  no  small  way, helped to underpin the whole iPod iTunes success story for Apple. A case in point is the way in which Apple was able to introduce into QuickTime a speciﬁc iPod export option in support of the ﬁfth-generation video-capable iPod, thanks to the component-based nature of QuickTime. Suddenly any- one with QuickTime 7 Pro could create video podcasts or export existing content for the new iPod—on both Mac and Windows.  For readers of this book, the exciting thing is that this very same enabling technology is available to us—developers with a focus on the Windows plat- form. Not only that, but with the advent of QuickTime 7 on Windows it is now possible to develop with QuickTime using most of the popular RAD and scripting tools that Windows developers enjoy including, of course, the .NET environment. And with much of the complexity of QuickTime having been assiduously bundled up into a collection of easy-to-use components, even the feeble excuse of having to learn a new and complex API no longer washes.  What’s in This Book?  This book speciﬁcally addresses QuickTime development on Windows using the QuickTime COM components that were released by Apple with Quick- Time  7.  An  introductory  chapter  sets  the  scene  with  useful  background information on QuickTime as well as on .NET and COM development. The initial chapters then cover the basics of using the QuickTime COM ActiveX Control to open a movie as well as to control its playback and display within the host application. As a key concept, the QuickTime Object Model is cen-                   tral to the material in this book, and it is presented next. Each of its constitu- ent QuickTime objects is systematically examined, often in the context of a practical application. Subsequent chapters deal with speciﬁc topics, such as event handling, export, and metadata, in considerable depth and also delve into  some  of  the  more  advanced  aspects  of  QuickTime  development.  The culmination of all this is a chapter devoted to the design and development of a  complete  object-oriented  QuickTime  application  in  Visual  Basic  .NET. Broadening the focus somewhat, later chapters look at scripting with Quick- Time in both Windows Scripting Host and Microsoft Ofﬁce applications.  The  speciﬁcs  of  using  QuickTime  in  other  popular  COM  development environments, such as Visual Basic 6, Delphi, and ATL, are covered in an appendix. While much of this book inevitably focuses on using QuickTime in  Visual  Basic  .NET  and  C,  the  principles  and  even  the  code  samples should be readily transferable to other component-based development tools and languages.  Code snippets are liberally scattered throughout the book and are speciﬁ- cally  designed  to  support  the  explanation  of  each  topic:  for  a  developer,  a few lines of code will often illuminate what any amount of careful explana- tion cannot. Longer code samples address the kind of real-world issues and applications that you are likely to encounter in your own projects. All of the code samples, scripts, and a few sample media ﬁles are available from the website associated with this book:   www.skylark.ie qt4.net  Discovering QuickTime  QuickTime entered my world well over a decade ago when I serendipitously happened upon QuickTime and HyperCard on the Mac at more or less the same time. A revolutionary technology that could play videos and sounds in conjunction  with  a  unique  scripting  language  was  an  intoxicating  mix  for interactive developers at the time—but, sadly, not on the then-mushrooming Windows  platform.  Apple’s  farsighted  release  of  QuickTime  for  Windows offered half the solution, but unfortunately there was no HyperCard equiva- lent  on  Windows.  Or  was  there?  The  more  I  looked  at  Microsoft’s  Visual Basic,  the  more  I  liked  it:  it  had  all  the  immediacy  and  productivity  of HyperCard and yet was clearly a serious development tool—but how to put the  two  together?  Initially  this  necessitated  the  development  of  a  16-bit QuickTime VBX control  or VB plug-in  written in C. In time I rewrote this  Preface  xiii                in C++ as a 32-bit QuickTime ActiveX control, eventually to be released in its own right as a commercial component  and still available* . Pairing Visual Basic  with  QuickTime  turned  out  to  be  a  hugely  productive  development platform for efﬁcient delivery of CD DVD-ROM titles and other interactive applications.  Remarkably, this is even more the case today when you consider the latest developments in QuickTime, the advent of next-generation RAD tools, such as Visual Basic .NET and C, and now, at last, the authoritative components from Apple to put the two together effectively.  You  may  be  entirely  new  to  QuickTime  or  perhaps  you  are  about  to embark  on  developing  with  QuickTime  on  the  Windows  platform  for  the ﬁrst time. Whatever the case, you may be forgiven for feeling a scintilla of anticipation at this point—as I often do when about to delve into some new and potentially exciting piece of technology. As you unwrap and discover the capabilities of QuickTime and the QuickTime COM components and as you apply them in your own applications, I hope that, with the aid of this book, your experience will be both rewarding and enjoyable  *   www.skylark.ie skylight  xiv  Preface                  Acknowledgments  Having had the pleasure of working with the QuickTime engineering team at Apple, I can personally attest to the creative energy, skill, and sheer commit- ment that is the human driving force behind QuickTime. Eric Carlson, with whom I worked closely on the QuickTime for COM project at Apple, epito- mizes this. Not only did Eric have the vision for opening up QuickTime to the COM and .NET developer community, he also brought to bear a deep understanding of QuickTime itself, which, combined with his technical acu- men and pursuit of excellence, ensured that the subject of this book became a reality. As the content of this book gradually took shape, Eric’s input and comments have been invaluable and very much appreciated.  Many others on the QuickTime engineering team at Apple have provided assistance  and  encouragement.  The  solidity  and  robustness  of  the  Quick- Time for COM technology are testimony to the efforts of Paul Zemanek. Paul has been generous with his help, spot-checking code samples, commenting on  drafts,  and  providing  an  all-important  reader’s  perspective.  Respected authors  of  other  books  in  the  Steve  Gulie  and Tim  Monroe  have  both  contributed  constructive  and  detailed  reviews  of draft chapters. Without their encouragement and enthusiastic feedback, this book  might  well  have  foundered.  Comments  from  Jeremy  Jones  and  Thai Wey Then have also been helpful in shaping the style of the book at an early stage and in weeding out one or two decidedly shaky analogies.  QuickTime  Developer  Series,   I am grateful to Tim Cox of Morgan Kaufmann and Michael Hinkson at Apple  who  together  made  this  book  possible.  Tim’s  gentle  prodding  has given  this  developer  the  impetus  to  leave  aside  coding   fun   and  keep  up with the writing  hard work . Thanks also to Jessie Evans and Richard Camp at Morgan Kaufmann.  Not having written a book before, I was never entirely sure what an editor actually  did.  Well,  now  I  know—and  I  admire  her.  Elisabeth  Beller  has helped to inject clarity and consistency, while all the time ﬁghting an uphill battle to Americanise  or should that be “Americanize”  my spelling, gram- mar,  comma here—I’m learning!  and punctuation. I have greatly appreci- ated her efﬁciency and organization in pulling this book together in the face of a tight deadline and the vagaries of a ﬁrst-time author.  xv                            The illustrations and code samples in this book have been enlivened with  archive. My thanks are video clips and images from the extensive  due to Max Whitby and Dave Gosney, my fellow directors at   for allowing me to use this material. David Suttle of suttledesign kindly created the funky    movie that features in early chapters.  Hello World  BirdGuides,  BirdGuides  Jan has been a constant support as I have been writing. If she has some- times wondered why technical writing requires sustained periods gazing out of the window at the birds on the feeders, or how come the end result of a full day’s “writing” can amount to no more than a few measly paragraphs or a single anemic-looking code sample, she has had the graciousness never to let on. Robert, Mary-Lynn, Joel, and Simon have treated Dad’s book project with the light-hearted good humor that it deserved, helping to keep me sane and  usually  good-humored in the process.  xvi  Acknowledgments                   1  Introduction 1  Introduction  It’s a fair bet that since you bothered to beg, borrow, or perhaps even buy this  book,  you  will  have  some  idea,  however  vague,  of  the  capabilities  of QuickTime. Some of you will be intimately acquainted with the QuickTime C C++ application programming interface  API  in all its savage glory; oth- ers will have used QuickTime in various scripting environments on the Mac or  on  Windows—perhaps  in  Macromedia  Director  or  via  AppleScript— maybe  even  in  HyperCard  if  you’ve  been  around  long  enough.  Or  your QuickTime  experience  may  amount  to  nothing  more  than  ﬁddling  around with the Pro edition of QuickTime Player.  Nor is it unreasonable to assume that you may already have worked with Visual Basic or with one of the many other Rapid Application Development, or RAD, tools. If so, you will not need to be convinced of the productivity, efﬁciency, and plain old ease of use that has characterized such tools, from the  humble  beginnings  of  Visual  Basic  over  a  decade  ago  to  those  heavy- weights of today: Visual Basic .NET and C.  Underpinning the success of these tools has been the component-based architecture—ﬁrst in COM  the Component Object Model  and later in its now fully ﬂedged .NET incarnation. Millions—literally—of developers have grown to love these tools for no other reason than the fact that should their application demand, say, a Kanji editor or a simulated aircraft instrument panel  or  maybe  a  calendar  with  psychedelic  dates,  all  they  have  to  do  is source  the  appropriate  component,  drop  it  into  their  toolbox,  and  away they go.  QuickTime has not entirely been left out of this party: a few third-party developers have been supplying useful QuickTime components for quite a  1                        number  of  years.  But  none  of  these  components  has  been  anywhere  near comprehensive  in  its  exposure  of  the  QuickTime  API  nor,  critically,  has Apple itself gotten involved. The release in 2005 of the ofﬁcial  Apple Quick- Time Control   changes all this.  least   in  playback  and  editing—to   The Apple QuickTime Control delivers a substantial chunk of QuickTime technology—at  toolboxes  of component-based  developers.  Using  Visual  Basic,  C,  Delphi,  and  other component-based tools, developers can now have access to the unique capabil- ities of QuickTime in their Windows applications, with the blessing and sup- port of Apple.  the   Why QuickTime?  For  many  Windows  developers,  QuickTime  is  perceived  as  nothing  more than  a  media  playback  technology,  vying  with  the  likes  of  Microsoft  Win- dows Media Player and Real Player for the right to handle the multiplicity of video  and  audio  ﬁles  that  litter  their  disks.  This  does  QuickTime  a  grave injustice:  QuickTime  is  about  a  whole  lot  more  than  just  video  playback. What is often not understood is that QuickTime can also be used for audio and video capture, for media creation and editing, for combining media from various online and off-line sources, for importing and exporting media in a host of different formats, for display and manipulation of images, for creat- ing sophisticated interactive applications, for exploring interactive 3D envi- ronments—and so the list goes on. In short, QuickTime is a complete media architecture and, as such, it is unique.  None of the competing playback technologies—not even Windows Media Player—can sustain such a claim. Launched way back in 1991, the Quick- Time architecture has managed to embrace a succession of emerging media technologies  and  standards.  Today,  QuickTime  is  more  successful  than  at any point in its history, and this is testimony to the robustness of its enduring architecture and its cross-platform appeal.  Another  common  misconception  amongst  Windows  developers  is  worth scotching at the earliest opportunity. This is that QuickTime is essentially a Mac   slight  pejorative  inﬂexion  here   technology,  a  few  essential  bits  of which have been ported, somewhat hastily, over to Windows. The fact, of course,  is  that  QuickTime  for  Windows  is  every  bit  as  feature-laden  and performance-oriented as its twin sibling on the Mac. Just as QuickTime on OS X builds on the powerful video, audio, and graphics services of that oper- ating system, so QuickTime for Windows takes maximum advantage of the  2  Chapter 1   Introduction                                                                equivalent  services  in  Windows.  True,  new  QuickTime  features  often  ﬁrst see the light of day on the Mac—that’s inevitable—but, more often than not, they soon make an appearance in QuickTime for Windows.  From  the  developer  perspective,  QuickTime  is  best  thought  of  as  an enabling technology. It enables us, as developers, to include capabilities in our applications that would otherwise be beyond our capacity  either techni- cally  or  due  to  limited  resources .  In  some  cases,  entire  applications  are made possible only with the underlying capabilities of QuickTime. Some of the  useful  capabilities  that  QuickTime  might  bring  to  our  applications include   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Playback of media in many different video, audio, and animation formats Streaming media playback Video and audio editing Frame-by-frame video creation Video and audio capture Conversion of video and audio between a whole range of popular formats Addition of close captioning and graphic overlays to video Ability to view and navigate around panoramic VR scenes and 3D objects  Why .NET and COM?  Visual  Basic  1.0  was  released  in  1991—about  seven  months  before  Quick- Time 1.0—bringing together the ease of use of the familiar BASIC program- ming  language  with  an  interactive  graphical  user  interface   GUI   design environment. Suddenly anyone with a smattering of BASIC and the ability to drag  and  drop  could  try  their  hand  at  creating  GUI  applications  for  Win- dows. And they certainly did: within the space of a few years, Visual Basic was to become the most popular programming language of all time.  Professional  developers,  meanwhile,  working  with  traditional  program- ming languages such as C, and the emerging C++, gazed out disdainfully at this upstart from the safety of their curly brackets. With its evil GOTO state- ment,  BASIC  had  always  been  an  object  of  scorn  for  proponents  of  struc- tured  programming  languages.  In  1975,  Edsger  W.  Dijkstra  famously declared of students who had some prior exposure to BASIC: “as potential programmers  they  are  mentally  mutilated  beyond  hope  of  regeneration.” Sadly this attitude has a tendency to live on in the mindset of many software professionals, tarring Visual Basic with the same brush.  Why .NET and COM?  3                                    COM  But,  while  such  prejudiced  engineers  grew  old  on  their  endless  edit- compile-link-test  treadmills,  less-blinkered  developers  began  to  realize  that using  Visual  Basic  allowed  them  to  develop  GUI  applications  and,  more important, get them to market much quicker than traditional programming languages. And all this could be achieved without abandoning good design and structured programming techniques: it was possible to use Basic without polluting your code with GOTO statements. The RAD era had begun.  Efﬁciency and ease of development were not the only reasons why Visual Basic thrived. Its support for the Component Object Model, or COM, stan- dard provided a ready means of accessing software libraries and user inter- face   UI   components,  often  developed  by  third  parties.  RAD  beneﬁted enormously, and still does, from a huge and diverse range of available soft- ware  components.  Everything  from  small  specialized  UI  controls  to  a  full working spreadsheet could simply be dropped into your application.  COM  is  an  application  and  vendor-independent  standard,  and  a  COM component such as the QuickTime Control can be used in a variety of differ- ent development tools and even desktop applications as long as they respect the  requisite  COM  containment  standards.  The  popularity  of  Visual  Basic, and the resulting proliferation of useful COM components, prompted other development tool vendors to introduce COM support. The best example is Borland’s Delphi, offering a very similar—and many would argue, superior— 1 development environment to that of Visual Basic, but using Object Pascal instead of Basic.  In Depth: COM  Component-based  development  would  simply  not  be  possible  without  rigorous  and well-deﬁned standards that ensure that a component from vendor X will work smoothly alongside a component from vendor Y or Z. The Component Object Model  COM  is by far the most successful standard, with hundreds of vendors supplying an incredible array of components to meet every conceivable developer need.  Much of the success of COM as a basis for software components is due to its rigorous the collections of properties and func-   interfaces—  insistence on well-deﬁned component tions exposed by an object.  1  This was rechristened as the Delphi programming language in recent versions of Delphi.  4  Chapter 1   Introduction                                       The COM standard  amongst many other details :   cid:2   Deﬁnes  the  way  in  which  the  interface s   of  a  component  are  made  available  to  its   cid:2   Deﬁnes a set of standardized data types that can be used to pass data back and forth  host.  between components.   cid:2   Deﬁnes how the component can notify its host of interesting events.  control  A COM    is distinguished from COM components in general by the fact that it has a visual representation of some kind  often managing its own window  and can only be placed on a visual container such as a form or dialog. Standards ensure that both the COM control and its container can communicate with each other through a set of mutu- ally respected interfaces.  When  it  comes  to  desktop  applications,  the  most  comprehensive  COM support is, not surprisingly, to be found in the Microsoft Ofﬁce suite of appli- cations, any of which can host COM controls, with scripting support avail- able through Visual Basic for Applications  VBA . As we will see later in this book,  the  judicious  use  of  COM  components  in  an  Excel  spreadsheet  or Access database can open up interesting and productive avenues in that twi- light zone between off-the-shelf and fully custom applications.  So carried away did Microsoft become with the potential of COM that not only did they add COM support to their desktop applications, they decided to add it to the desktop itself in the form of Windows Script Host—an operat- ing  system–level  environment  for  running  scripts  written  in  either  Visual Basic  Scripting  Edition   VBScript   or  Microsoft’s  version  of  JavaScript  JScript . Such scripts can directly create COM objects and can also be used to script any application that exposes its functionality through COM inter- faces: a potent tool  as we will discover in Chapter 8  but one that has, unfor- tunately, been ruthlessly hijacked by darker forces ever since.  .NET  Visual Basic .NET and C are the next-generation RAD tools, building upon the success of Visual Basic 6.0. Both languages depend entirely on the under- lying .NET Framework for their execution environment and for system ser- vices. At the very heart of the .NET Framework is the Common Language Runtime,  or  CLR.  All  code  in  the  .NET  environment,  whether  written  in Visual Basic or C  or any other .NET language, for that matter , is compiled  Why .NET and COM?  5                                          Code that runs under the CLR is known as   to Intermediate Language  IL —a kind of assembly language for .NET. The IL is then, in turn, compiled to native code by the CLR just prior to execution. : its execution is tightly  monitored  and  controlled  by  the  CLR,  which  can  check  on  such things  as  array  indexes  and  type  safety,  as  well  as  provide  exception  han- dling, garbage collection, and security services. Contrast this with traditional compiled  or    code,  which  once  loaded  into  memory,  essentially has a free hand to do its worst.  managed code  unmanaged  The CLR also replaces the older COM environment, except that instead of managing  COM  objects,  the  CLR  is  tasked  with  the  management  of  .NET objects. The .NET Framework takes the object-based environment pioneered by COM to an entirely new level: even operating system components, such as a ﬁle or folder, or the display screen, are full-ﬂedged .NET objects. Indeed, much of what was once the preserve of the Win32 API is now wrapped by the  extensive  and  uniﬁed  suite  of  classes  known  as  the  .NET  Framework class library.  User interface development is also enhanced: in place of the motley col- lection of UI controls provided with Visual Basic 6.0, RAD developers can draw on the services of  a collection of UI controls whose usefulness belies its uninspiring name.  Windows Forms—  To the RAD enthusiast, Visual Basic .NET and C hold out the promise of even more productive and efﬁcient development, dispensing with many of the idiosyncrasies and shortcomings of Visual Basic 6.0 and Delphi. None of this comes without a ﬂip side: .NET applications require the .NET runtime, which weighs in at a whopping 20+ megabytes and must be installed before even the most simple application can run.  Many  would  argue  too,  with  some  justiﬁcation,  that  the  .NET  Frame- work—with its extra layer between operating system and application code— adds  signiﬁcantly  to  execution  overhead.  In  time,  though,  as  Windows  XP gives way to Vista  formerly Longhorn , the .NET Framework becomes more closely  intertwined  with  the  operating  system  itself,  and  with  faster  hard- ware, these considerations will inevitably become less relevant.  COM Interop  While COM has been eclipsed by .NET’s new component architecture, COM components are still very much accommodated within the .NET Framework through its   services. COM Interop wraps a COM component with a .NET wrapper; in this way it can be used as if it were a native .NET object. Almost invariably, this Interop wrapper works seamlessly behind the  COM Interop  6  Chapter 1   Introduction                scenes so that using COM components with Visual Basic .NET and C is no different from using native .NET components.  QuickTime Meets COM and .NET  Serious QuickTime development, on both Mac and Windows, has tradition- ally been the preserve of developers working directly with the QuickTime API in languages such as C or C++. For those lacking the requisite resources or inclination to use the QuickTime API, the alternative was to use authoring tools  that  supported  QuickTime,  such  as  Macromedia  Director.  Both  the QuickTime API and the major authoring tools were available cross-platform, so QuickTime developers on Windows tended to fall into either the API or authoring camps. RAD tools, such as Visual Basic, were largely ignored for want of QuickTime support.  An irony, not lost on Mac developers of a certain vintage, is that many of the concepts that have made Visual Basic such a resounding success—graph- ical  UI  design,  event-driven  scripts,  drop-in  components—originated  in HyperCard:  a  ground-breaking  programming  environment  for  the  Mac  re- leased  by  Apple  in  1987.  When  QuickTime  appeared  on  the  scene,  it  was logical for Apple to include QuickTime support in HyperCard, and it wasn’t long before the HyperCard QuickTime combination became the platform of choice for pioneer interactive multimedia developers. Unfortunately, Apple rather  lost  the  plot  with  HyperCard,  and  it  faded  from  the  scene  by  the mid-1990s.  Apple’s farsighted decision to port QuickTime to the Windows platform left some developers wondering if perhaps the HyperCard QuickTime com- bination on the Mac could be replicated on Windows with Visual Basic and QuickTime  for  Windows.  A  number  of  third-party  ActiveX  controls appeared that exposed a basic QuickTime feature-set for use in Visual Basic and other COM-aware environments. These components enjoyed a limited degree  of  success,  particularly  with  developers  producing  CD-ROM  and DVD-ROM products for the consumer and educational markets. But, inevita- bly,  without  the  direct  support  of  Apple,  QuickTime  adoption  within  the ever-growing COM and .NET sector was never going to be signiﬁcant. Mean- while, Mac developers on OS X were reaping the beneﬁts of the comprehen- sive and easy-to-use QuickTime support included in the Cocoa framework with QuickTime Kit  QTKit , not to mention the powerful QuickTime Player scripting automation capabilities provided by AppleScript. Nothing like this existed for Windows developers.   QuickTime Meets COM and .NET  7                                     Aware of the need to promote QuickTime development with the popular COM- and .NET-based Windows tools, Apple released the QuickTime COM Control and Object Library in 2005. Exposing a similar view of QuickTime to that offered by QTKit on the Mac, the new QuickTime Control opens up the possibilities for using QuickTime in any application or scripting environ- ment that supports the hosting of COM controls.  Suddenly it becomes possible to use QuickTime in all sorts of unexpected places:  in  an  Excel  spreadsheet,  on  a  database  form,  or  in  more  specialist applications such as LabVIEW  National Instruments:   . But, excit- ing as it might be to have movie trailers brightening up that cash ﬂow, it is the ability to deploy QuickTime in any of the mainstream RAD development tools that really gets developers excited. Visual Basic, C, and Delphi  Borland  are the big-hitters of course, but there are also less well-known but still popular tools such as ToolBook  SumTotal:    . www.toolbook.com  www.ni.com  If you’re familiar with the component-based development scene, you may be wondering why Apple has gone to all this trouble to release a COM con- trol and not a 100 percent native .NET control. Well, the answer is that a native  .NET  control  must,  by  deﬁnition,  run  entirely  within  the  Common Language  Runtime   CLR —the  mandatory  runtime  environment  for  .NET. QuickTime has been running on Windows since long before .NET was ever conceived  of,  so  all  of  the  code  within  QuickTime  is,  rather  pejoratively, classed  as    code  and  regarded  as  untouchable  by  a  native  .NET control. This is why the QuickTime Control is delivered as a COM control with an Interop wrapper so that it can be used in the .NET environment.  unmanaged  Porting  QuickTime  itself  to  run  under  the  CLR  would  in  any  case  be  a mammoth task, and given that the outstanding performance of QuickTime depends heavily on carefully tuned access to low-level system facilities, it’s difﬁcult  to  see  how  adding  an  extra  layer  would  not  impact  performance. Interestingly, Microsoft currently adopts the same approach with their com- peting Windows Media Player technology: if you want to use Media Player in your .NET application, then you use the Media Player COM Control with its Interop wrapper.  Who Is This Book For?  When  a  book  purports  to  cover  the  intersection  between  two  such wide-reaching topics as QuickTime and COM .NET development, it inevita- bly attracts a diverse readership. There is no such thing as a typical reader  8  Chapter 1   Introduction                             for whom this book has been ﬁne-tuned. Nevertheless, I have presumed to identify  several  groups  of  potential  readers  to  whom  this  book  should appeal:   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   You are a Windows developer, with reasonable competency in Visual Basic 6.0, Visual Basic .NET, C, Delphi, or perhaps other RAD or component- based  development  tools.  You  have  some  basic  understanding  of  what QuickTime is and what it can do, and you are keen to find out more. You  will  learn  how  to  use  QuickTime  in  your  Visual  Basic  6.0,  Visual Basic .NET, or C applications. In the process, you will inevitably learn more about QuickTime and especially about how to get the most out of the QuickTime Control and Object Library. For a more in-depth under- standing  of  QuickTime  itself,  you  may  occasionally  need  to  refer  to Apple’s QuickTime documentation or other resources. Already familiar with QuickTime, you have developed QuickTime appli- cations either on the Mac or on Windows. While you may or may not be conversant with the QuickTime API, you will certainly have a good grasp of  the  principal  concepts  of  the  QuickTime  architecture.  Your  develop- ment experience with RAD tools such as Visual Basic, on the other hand, is still at the steep part of the learning curve. You will very quickly learn how to include basic QuickTime functionality in  the  Visual  Basic  .NET  or  C  applications  that  you  are  learning  to develop. As you learn how to exploit some of the more advanced Quick- Time features, the code samples become more intricate, and you may find that you need to refer to your Visual Basic .NET or C learning material or documentation from time to time. By the end, you should be confident to deploy your expanding skills in pursuit of more sophisticated Quick- Time applications. You are, or are about to be, involved in QuickTime content production on  the  Windows  platform.  You  are  anxious  to  discover  how  much,  if any, of your workflow can be automated using COM or .NET scripting. You  may  already  be  familiar  with  what  can  be  achieved  using  Apple- Script on the Mac and are wondering whether something similar might be possible on Windows. You will discover that QuickTime Player on Windows can be scripted  or automated   in  a  very  similar  way  to  what  is  possible  with  QuickTime Player on the Mac. You will learn that once a movie is loaded in Quick- Time Player, the entire QuickTime Object Model is exposed and available for you to script from JScript, VBScript, or even from applications such as  Who Is This Book For?  9                               cid:2   Microsoft Excel. Depending on your specific workflow requirements, var- ious  techniques  will  be  available  for  creating  and  manipulating  Quick- Time content in a variety of formats. As a battle-hardened C or C++ developer with the QuickTime API, there is very little that you don’t already know about QuickTime. You already create  advanced  QuickTime  applications  on  the  Mac  directly  with  the QuickTime API or with Cocoa and QTKit, or on Windows using Visual C++ with the QuickTime API. Nevertheless, curiosity impels you to find out more about what can  and can’t  be achieved developing with Quick- Time in a RAD or scripting environment. You may be pleasantly surprised.  If you’ve gotten as far as this and you don’t even faintly recognize yourself in any of the cameos above, what can I say? Thank you for buying this book: I do hope you enjoy it and learn something, even if you bought it to look at the pictures or to impress your manager!  What Should I Know Before Reading This Book?  Since this book deals with the convergence of QuickTime with RAD technol- ogies such as Visual Basic and C, it clearly helps to know a little about both. At  the  very  least,  you  should  be  comfortable  with  creating  a  simple  Win- dows Forms  the .NET UI platform  application in either Visual Basic or C. Fortunately, this is very easy to learn, and there are innumerable books out there that purport to introduce you to Visual Basic in 21 days, 21 hours, or perhaps even in your sleep for all I know.  Experienced Visual Basic 6.0 developers who haven’t yet made the leap to .NET  will  ﬁnd  most  of  the  code  samples  to  be  readily  comprehensible, although a short foray into Visual Basic .NET is highly recommended.  If,  however,  you’re  coming  to  this  book  completely  new  to  QuickTime, you may well ﬁnd the learning curve more of a challenge. There is no getting around the fact that there is a lot to QuickTime. A good starting point would be to purchase QuickTime Pro  $29.99 at the time of writing  and familiarize yourself with the basics of movie playback and editing.  Code Samples  While the majority of code samples in this book are in Visual Basic .NET, translating these into C is often a trivial exercise and should not present a  10  Chapter 1   Introduction                                                             major obstacle to anyone familiar with C. That said, there are a few cases where C examples are used, either explicitly to demonstrate techniques that might differ signiﬁcantly from Visual Basic or, more likely, because I hap- pened to get out of the C side of the bed that day. Developers coming to this book from a C++ or Java background will undoubtedly be more comfortable working  with  C,  and  I  would  encourage  you  to  stick  with  this:  C  is  a superb language.  Many of the code samples shown in the text are simply fragments. While these fragments should be correct and functional in themselves, they will, of course, only work within the context of a complete application. In quite a few  cases,  however,  we  go  beyond  code  fragments  to  a  complete  working sample application. In order not to pad this book unnecessarily with irrele- vant code, I have often omitted boilerplate code that has no particular rele- vance  to  the  topic  under  consideration,  especially  when  it  comes  to  the sample applications.  One speciﬁc point should be drawn to your attention in case it causes con- fusion.  Visual  Basic  .NET  and  C  event  handlers  tend  to  have  rather long-winded and repetitive event handler parameters. Here’s the Play menu item handler, for example  Private Sub mnuPlay_Click ByVal sender As System.Object,             ByVal e As System.EventArgs  Handles mnuPlay.Click    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub   AxQTControl1.Movie.Play    The event handler parameters    As System.EventArgs   tend to distract from the simplicity of the implementation code, so I took the rash decision to get rid of them in the text, replacing them with an ellipsis instead as shown here:  System.Object ,   sender  ByVal    ByVal  As  e              Private Sub mnuPlay_Click ...  Handles mnuPlay.Click    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub   AxQTControl1.Movie.Play    End Sub  End Sub  Code Samples  11                                                           I hope you will forgive such unilateral tinkering with linguistic syntax and remember  to  add  the  standard  event  arguments  back  in  should  you  ever transcribe such handlers into your own code. Better still, just copy the event handler implementation into the prototype that Visual Studio will invariably have generated for you.  Most  of  the  sample  code  fragments  and  complete  sample  applications, together  with  speciﬁc  media  samples,  are  available  to  download  from  the website associated with this book:  www.skylark.ie qt4.net  Additional information and code samples may also be found on this web-  site, together with any errata.   Additional Resources  It is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd useful learning and reference material online cover- ing many of the technologies and tools that we will be discussing later in this book.  Often,  though,  the  sheer  volume  of  available  information  can  make the process of ﬁnding what you want rather exasperating. To aid you, here are some of the more useful and authoritative online resources.  .NET, Visual Basic, and C  When it comes to .NET, Visual Basic, and C, there is no shortage of books catering to everyone from the absolute beginner to the experienced profes- sional developer.

All  of  this  powerful  functionality  is  of course provided by QuickTime but, in the well-established tradition of good COM components, the complexity of the underlying technology is distilled into a set of easy-to-master COM interfaces.  Component-oriented developers are not the type to waste hours  or even precious minutes!  poring over documentation—not when it’s so easy to drop an unfamiliar component onto an empty form and see how far we can get. The goal is usually to ﬁgure out as quickly as possible whether or not the new  component  meets  our  expectations.  That’s  really  all  this  chapter  is about: uncovering the basics of the QuickTime COM Control as painlessly as possible. Later chapters follow with more systematic and in-depth informa- tion on QuickTime and the QuickTime Control.  Hello World!  No  self-respecting  book  on  practical  software  development  would  be  com- plete without the de rigueur Hello World! application to kick things off. But since  we’re  dealing  here  with  an  exciting  media  technology  rather  than  a dull programming language, perhaps our starting point  Figure 2.1  should be a minimal application to load and play a Hello World! movie—complete with backing sound track!  15                                  Figure 2.1  Hello World! movie.

Since we don’t want to lose anybody before we even get started, let’s ﬁrst make sure that you have indeed installed QuickTime 7.0.2—the ﬁrst version of QuickTime to include the QuickTime COM Control—or a later version.

If you have never used Visual Basic  VB  before, I would highly recommend that you don’t proceed too much farther without investing just a little time familiarizing yourself with VB and the Visual Studio .NET development environment. This book is not intended to teach you VB, and some prior knowledge will be assumed as we progress. The good news, of course, is that learning VB is a piece of cake! Visual Basic itself comes with some excellent getting-started tutorials or, if you collect dead forests, most book outlets will oblige with a bewildering array of VB titles to satisfy your every whim.  You should end up with a freshly created Windows application consisting of one form and not much else. If you are new to Visual Basic .NET and over- come with excitement at having created your ﬁrst Windows application with- out touching a line of code, then I suggest you press F5 to build and run your application.

In  the  next  section  we  build  on  what  we’ve  discovered  so  far  to  create  a handy little utility application: Simple Player.  Simple Player—The Basics  As  I  said  in  the  Introduction,  this  book  is  really  all  about  bringing  those amazing  technologies  that  are  available  in  QuickTime  into  such  powerful and productive development environments as Visual Basic .NET or C. As we’ve  discovered  in  the  previous  section,  the  Apple  QuickTime  Control makes  this  possible  in  a  very  straightforward  and  accessible  way.  Indeed, one  can  develop  a  QuickTime  application  without  really  needing  to  know too  much  about  QuickTime  at  all,  let  alone  about  the  somewhat  daunting QuickTime API  Application Programming Interface .  In the rest of this chapter, we’re going to put together a very simple but useful movie player  Figure 2.7 . Think of it as a bare-bones version of the QuickTime Player application that comes with QuickTime. In later chapters we will extend the functionality of this application as we bring in additional  Simple Player—The Basics  23   Figure 2.7 Simple Player.  features of QuickTime. In the process you should pick up useful concepts and sample code to deploy in your own applications.  As a starting point, I have put together a skeleton Visual Basic application comprising a resizeable window with a few simple menus. You will ﬁnd this project on the website in Samples\SimplePlayer\SimplePlayer A. Build and run this application, and then skim through the menus: this should give you a good overview of what we’re about to do.  Initialization  If you’ve looked at the Simple Player skeleton application in Design mode, you’ll have noticed that Form1 is completely devoid of any controls. The ﬁrst thing we must do is to add a QuickTime Control to the form from the Tool- box.  This  time,  instead  of  setting  properties  via  the  Properties  window  or Property Page, we’ll set them in some initialization code. This is generally better practice since it’s all too easy to set properties manually via the Prop- erties window and then forget that we’ve actually set them.  24 Chapter 2 Getting Started with the QuickTime Control   The usual place to carry out any initialization of controls on the form is in the Form1_Load subroutine, which gets called just after the form and all its controls  are  loaded.  Double-click  on  the  form  to  edit  the  code  behind  the form: we’ll add a few lines to the Form1_Load handler to anchor the control in the top-left corner of the form, turn off its border, and make the movie controller visible by default.  Private Sub Form1_Load ...  Handles MyBase.Load    AxQTControl1.Location = New System.Drawing.Point 0, 0    AxQTControl1.BorderStyle = QTOControlLib.BorderStylesEnum.bsNone   AxQTControl1.MovieControllerVisible = True  End Sub  In Depth: Enumerations  If you’re not very familiar with Visual Basic, COM, or .NET, you may be wondering what’s going on in the middle line in the preceding code in which the BorderStyle property is set. Well, the explanation is that certain properties of the control, such as BorderStyle or Sizing, can only be set to one of a ﬁxed set of predeﬁned numeric values, each represent- ing a legal option for that property. The valid options for BorderStyle are 0, 1, or 2, repre- senting  no  border,  plain  border,  or  3D  border,  respectively.  So  we  could  equally  have written  AxQTControl1.BorderStyle = 0  and it would have happily done the same thing. But it’s not easy to remember what arbi- trary numeric values stand for. So COM and .NET  along with many serious programming languages  allow such sets of values to be grouped together into an enumeration where each value is assigned an easier-to-remember name that you can use in your code instead of the value itself.  In this case the enumeration is called BorderStylesEnum and it contains the following  set of values:  0 = bsNone   no border   1 = bsPlain   plain border   2 = bs3D   3D border    The name of the enumeration is preﬁxed by the name of the library or namespace to which it belongs: in this case QTOControlLib, which is the namespace for everything relat- ing to the QuickTime Control.  Simple Player—The Basics 25   Opening and Closing Movies  At the start of this chapter, we saw that we could open a movie by setting the URL property of the QuickTime Control to the full path and ﬁle name of a movie:  AxQTControl1.URL = "d:\My Movies\KidsPicnic.mov"  In Simple Player we’d like to be able to browse for any movie anywhere on our computer—or even on our network for that matter—and then open it. Windows Forms provides a convenient ﬁle browsing dialog in the shape of the OpenFileDialog control, which can be found on the Windows Forms tab in the VS.NET Toolbox  you might need to scroll well down the long list of Windows  Forms  controls  to  ﬁnd  it .  Just  pop  one  of  these  controls  on  the form, where it will be given the default name OpenFileDialog1. Now select the File  Open Movie... menu item in our Form1 design view, double-click to get  into  code  view,  and  you  can  implement  the  menu  item  handler  as follows:  Private Sub mnuOpen_Click ...  Handles mnuOpen.Click    If OpenFileDialog1.ShowDialog   = DialogResult.OK Then     AxQTControl1.URL = OpenFileDialog1.FileName     End If  End Sub  So we have a single line of code to show the standard File Open dialog and check that a ﬁle was indeed selected, plus a second line to set the con- trol’s URL property to the ﬁle we’ve selected—that’s it! With just a handful of lines of code we can select and load any movie  or, indeed, sound ﬁle or image . Before you try it, let’s make sure we can properly close any ﬁle that we  might  open  by  setting  URL  to  an  empty  string  in  the  mnuClose_Click handler:  Private Sub mnuClose_Click ...  Handles mnuClose.Click    AxQTControl1.URL = ""  End Sub  26 Chapter 2 Getting Started with the QuickTime Control   Also, for completeness, let’s make sure that when someone closes the form, the movie gets closed. We can do this in the handler for the form’s Closed event:  Private Sub Form1_Closed ...  Handles MyBase.Closed    AxQTControl1.URL = ""  End Sub  Now you can experiment with opening and closing a few movies. You may have noticed that OpenFileDialog is not selective and will allow you to open any type of ﬁle irrespective of its ﬁle extension, leaving Quick- Time with the unenviable task of trying to ﬁgure out what to do with it. A little  polish  would  be  appropriate  here,  such  as  the  ability  to  choose  the type of ﬁle we would like to open: Movies, Audio ﬁles, or All ﬁles. This turns out to be quite easy to achieve with the Filter property of the OpenFile- Dialog control:  Private Sub mnuOpen_Click ...  Handles mnuOpen.Click    Dim filter As String   filter = "Movies*.mov;*.mpg;*.avi;*.dv"   filter += "Audio files*.wav;*.aif;*.mp3;*.m4a;*.m4p"   filter += "All files  *.* *.*"   OpenFileDialog1.Filter = filter    If OpenFileDialog1.ShowDialog   = DialogResult.OK Then     AxQTControl1.URL = OpenFileDialog1.FileName     End If  End Sub  Audio files  Note the pipe characters    that delimit the ﬁlter ﬁelds and the fact that there is a pair of ﬁelds for each ﬁlter option. The ﬁrst ﬁeld in each pair is purely descriptive, for example,   Simple Player—The Basics 27   Figure 2.8 Open Movie dialog for Simple Player.  while the corresponding second ﬁeld comprises a list of wildcard ﬁle speciﬁ- cations delimited by semicolons, for example,  *.wav;*.aif;*.mp3;*.m4a;*.m4p  Now—Figure 2.8—we have an Open Movie dialog to be proud of!  Controlling the Movie  Now  that  Simple  Player  is  capable  of  opening  and  closing  movies,  we  can shift our attention to the Movie menu that’s lurking in our menu bar and, more speciﬁcally, to some of the basic functionality required to work with movies.  You will recall from the QTHelloWorld example earlier in this chapter that the properties and methods associated with a movie are all accessed through the  QuickTime  Control’s  Movie  property.  As  we  discovered,  this  property  28 Chapter 2 Getting Started with the QuickTime Control   returns a child object representing the movie itself. This makes the ﬁrst two items in the Movie menu rather trivial to implement:  Private Sub mnuPlay_Click ...  Handles mnuPlay.Click    AxQTControl1.Movie.Play    Private Sub mnuRewind_Click ...  Handles mnuRewind.Click    AxQTControl1.Movie.Rewind    End Sub  End Sub  Build and run Simple Player again and load a movie—you’ll notice that these two menu items work as advertised.  But, as it turns out, we have been a little too simplistic especially if our application  is  to  be  professionally  robust.  Try  running  the  application again, but this time DON’T load a movie and select Movie  Play. Dumb? Of course! But someone is sure to try it and the resulting error message is rather alarming:  An  unhandled  exception  of  type  ‘System.NullReferenceException’  occurred  in SimplePlayer.exe.  While  unhandled  exception   loosely  translated:  Oh  dear  me!  Something untoward occurred!  may feature vaguely in the lexicon of the seasoned com- puter user, System.NullReferenceException is just plain bafﬂing whatever way you look at it. Clearly, we need a more meaningful message, but you might well ask, Why the error in the ﬁrst place?  The additional information that .NET supplies in the error message hints  at the reason:  Additional information: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.  Translated from .NET-speak, the entire error message simply reads  You tried to tell a Movie object that doesn’t exist to Play—I just can’t handle it!  Remember  that  AxQTControl1.Movie  is  in  fact  a  reference  to  a  movie object. However, if we haven’t loaded a movie, then no movie object exists  Simple Player—The Basics 29   and .NET is perfectly entitled to protest with a System.NullReferenceException when you attempt to invoke the Play method on a nonexistent object!  Exception  An exception occurs when something out of the ordinary, or exceptional, occurs outside of the normal program ﬂow—often an error of some kind, but sometimes simply a notiﬁca- tion that something has happened that we should know about. Fortunately, it is not difﬁ- cult to catch exceptions and manage them gracefully, as we’ll see in Chapter 5 when we discuss exception handling in more detail.  Experienced  developers  will  recognize  that  there  are  two  ways  we  can handle this more gracefully: we can put in place an exception handler to trap the error condition, or we can fend off the error by preventing its occurrence in  the  ﬁrst  place.  In  this  case,  we  will  add  a  simple  check  that  the Movie object does in fact exist before attempting to access its Play method:  Private Sub mnuPlay_Click ...  Handles mnuPlay.Click    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub   AxQTControl1.Movie.Play    Private Sub mnuRewind_Click ...  Handles mnuRewind.Click    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub   AxQTControl1.Movie.Rewind    End Sub  End Sub  More sophisticated UI design, of course, would dictate that we should dis- able or gray-out the Play and Rewind menu items until such time as we have a  loaded  movie.  Notwithstanding,  battle-hardened  developers  will  always cater for the unexpected error even if it “should never occur.”  Getting Information about the Movie  Having gone to the trouble of opening a half-forgotten movie buried some- where in the bowels of our hard disk, it would be useful if we could easily  30 Chapter 2 Getting Started with the QuickTime Control   view some basic information about the movie such as its title or perhaps its length. Such information is usually referred to as metadata  more to come in Chapter 5  and can be viewed through the Annotations tab in the Properties window in QuickTime Player  Window  Show Movie Properties . Happily, our Movie object provides easy access to metadata about the movie through its Annotation property: we must specify which annotation we want with an annotation ID from QTAnnotationsEnum.  In Simple Player, the last item in our Movie menu is Movie Info.... Select- ing this should display a dialog with some key information about the movie:  Private Sub mnuGetInfo_Click ...  Handles mnuGetInfo.Click  Dim s As String If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    s = ""   With AxQTControl1.Movie     s += s + "Full Name   : "     s += .Annotation QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationFullName  + vbCrLf     s += "Duration    : "     s += CStr .Duration  + vbCrLf     s += "Copyright   : "     s += .Annotation QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationCopyright  + vbCrLf   End With   MsgBox s, MsgBoxStyle.Information, "Movie Info"   End Sub  Note  the  use  of  the  With  AxQTControl1.Movie  syntax  to  simplify  coding: within  the  With  construct,  properties  and  methods  of  the Movie  object  are referenced  with  a  leading  period  to  represent  the  object.  Notice  also  that Duration, being an integer property, is converted to a string using the CStr function.  For simplicity each piece of information is appended to a string, which is  then displayed in a humble MsgBox dialog, as shown in Figure 2.9.  Simple Player—The Basics 31   Figure 2.9 Information about the movie.  Scaling the Movie  In many applications you will want to change the scale at which the movie is displayed on the screen, say, to double size or half size or perhaps even to ﬁll the screen. Our Movie menu has two scale options—1X and 2X—and these are easily implemented using the SetScale method of the QuickTime Control:  Private Sub mnuScale1x_Click ...  Handles mnuScale1x.Click    AxQTControl1.SetScale 1     '1X  Private Sub mnuScale2x_Click ...  Handles mnuScale2x.Click    AxQTControl1.SetScale 2     '2X  End Sub  End Sub  32 Chapter 2 Getting Started with the QuickTime Control   SetScale  can  take  either  a  single  ﬂoating-point  value  that  is  applied  to both  X  and  Y  axes,  or  two  ﬂoating-point  values  for  independent  X  and  Y scaling:  AxQTControl1.SetScale 0.5, 5.75     'Tall and thin AxQTControl1.SetScale 10.2, 1.75    'Short and fat  The default behavior of the control is to scale its own size to that of the movie it contains. In many cases, as with our Simple Player, this is exactly the behavior we want, but there are other options that we will touch on in more detail in the next chapter.  Full-Screen Movies  Anyone who has shelled out for the Pro version of QuickTime will be famil- iar with the Present Movie... option in QuickTime Player, which allows you to  play  your  movies  at  stunning  full-screen  resolution.  Irritatingly  fond  of this feature are owners of 30" ﬂat-screen displays and other such decadent visual real estate!   You may be surprised to learn that this is not in fact a unique feature of the Pro QuickTime Player application but is available via the QuickTime API to anyone with QuickTime installed, even if they have never paid Apple a penny. As you should come to expect by now, the QuickTime Control exposes this functionality very simply using its Boolean FullScreen property:  Private Sub mnuFullScreen_Click ...  Handles mnuFullScreen.Click    AxQTControl1.FullScreen = True  End Sub  OK, so we can get our movie to display full screen, but why hasn’t our Movie menu got an option to TURN OFF full screen? Stop and think for a moment...  Got  it  yet?  Well,  full  screen  implies  just  that:  our  movie  ﬁlls  the  entire screen obliterating everything else, our application and menus included. The only means of escape—for now, anyway—is the  default  Escape key.  Simple Player—The Basics 33   Automatically Sizing the Form  Up  to  now  we  have  been  concerned  with  dispatching  commands  to  our QuickTime Control to do this and that, and occasionally asking it for some piece of information. But there will often be occasions when we would like the QuickTime Control to take the initiative and tell us when something hap- pens so that we can respond to it—an essential requirement for any serious, event-driven application.  For example, we might like to be informed whenever the movie changes size. This will occur when the movie is ﬁrst loaded or if its scale is changed: some movies may even change size dynamically as they play. If the Sizing property of the control is set to its default option  qtControlFitsMovie , then anytime the movie changes size, the control will change size in sympathy so that it always wraps itself snugly around the movie.  And anytime the control changes size, it ﬁres a SizeChanged event to tell anyone who’s listening that it is now a different size. The form on which the control is placed can intercept this event in a code routine known as an event handler  Figure 2.10 .  Knowing that the movie has changed size is clearly very useful especially in  a  user  interface   UI   context.  For  instance,  we  might  wish  to  reposition controls on our form so that they line up neatly with the movie irrespective of  its  size.  In  our  Simple  Player  application,  however,  we  can  put  the SizeChanged event to good use in automatically sizing our form to ﬁt the con- trol, which in turn ﬁts the movie—a bit like tightly packed Russian dolls—all with a single line of code. Here’s the event handler on Form1:  Private Sub AxQTControl1_SizeChanged ByVal sender As Object,    ByVal e As System.EventArgs  Handles AxQTControl1.SizeChanged    Me.ClientSize = AxQTControl1.Size  End Sub  Notice we are setting the ClientSize, or the inside dimensions, of the form to which this event handler belongs  Me  to match the size of the control. The overall size of the form including caption bar and frame will automatically change to accommodate this.  34 Chapter 2 Getting Started with the QuickTime Control   Form1  AxQTControl1  Movie  SizeChanged  Event handler:  Sub AxQTControl1_SizeChanged ...    ... End Sub  Figure 2.10 Event handler on the form handles SizeChanged event ﬁred by the QuickTime Control.  About...  Every  application  should  have  an  About  screen  and  Simple  Player  is  no exception. In fact, it has two: the Help  About... menu item displays infor- mation about the application, while Help  About QuickTime Control... dis- plays information about the QuickTime Control and about QuickTime itself. AboutForm.vb  is  a  standard  application  About  box  populated  with  key attributes  of  the  .NET  assembly  using  the  AssemblyInfo  helper  class  as deﬁned in AssemblyInfo.vb.  More interesting is the menu handler that displays information about the  QuickTime Control:  Private Sub mnuAboutQTControl_Click ...  Handles mnuAboutQTControl.Click    AxQTControl1.ShowAboutBox    End Sub  All this does is call the ShowAboutBox method of the control, which in turn displays some useful version information about both the control and Quick- Time, as we see in Figure 2.11.  Simple Player—The Basics 35   Figure 2.11 QuickTime Control About box.  Summary  Rather  than  burdening  you  with  pages  of  tedious  introduction,  we  have deliberately jumped straight in, dropped a QuickTime Control on a Visual Basic  form,  and  quickly  discovered  what  we  could  do  with  it.  If  my  ploy worked, you should by now have a feel for just how useful and productive this combination of the QuickTime Control with the .NET environment can be. We managed to rapidly create a useful and nontrivial little QuickTime application using remarkably few lines of code. Signiﬁcantly, the code we did have to write was almost all genuine application code: the .NET Framework, Windows Forms, and the QuickTime Control all combined forces to relieve us of a lot of the drudgery.  36 Chapter 2 Getting Started with the QuickTime Control                         3  3  Using the QuickTime Control  Introduction  Flinging together the odd sample application—such as our Simple Player—to demonstrate a new software component is one thing; applying that compo- nent  in  the  creation  of  real-world,  professional-grade  applications  is  quite another. The challenge is even greater when the technology involves digital media  such  as  video,  sounds,  and  images,  where  lofty  user  expectations often  extend  to  smart  visual  design,  sophisticated  user  interfaces,  and smooth interaction, not to mention stability and performance.  might  With  this  in  mind,  the  last  chapter  was  sort  of  a  tantalizing  antipasti course designed to whet the appetite for what   be possible, while leav- ing ample room for what’s to come. The next two chapters are more main course—solid and chunky, with the odd interesting accompaniment on the side. We take a more considered and in-depth look at the QuickTime Con- trol itself, at the object model that it exposes, and at the essential concepts needed to get the most out of both in your own applications. Just so things don’t get too abstract, we will revisit Simple Player every now and again whenever we spot something useful that could enhance its feature set or performance.  Review the detail in these next two chapters, study its application in the code samples, and convince yourself that the QuickTime Control really does merit serious attention if you are developing with QuickTime on the Win- dows platform. And if you are already developing with a competing technol- ogy such as Windows Media Player, you will be in an excellent position to assess the relative merits.  37                                                                       The Apple QuickTime Control  The best way to think of the QuickTime Control is as a wrapper component that encapsulates QuickTime and exposes much of its functionality in a stan- dardized and easy-to-use format. Or, if you want to be more precise, you can describe the QuickTime Control as a COM control that encapsulates Quick- Time functionality inside a COM container such as the form or dialog box  i.e., window  in your own application.  COM ActiveX?  ActiveX control.   is the more up-to-date name for what was once known, and is frequently  But I thought there already was a QuickTime ActiveX Control used as the QuickTime  I’ve heard the QuickTime COM Control also referred to as an ActiveX control. What’s  Q:   the difference? A:  COM control still referred to, as an  Q:   plug-in in Internet Explorer? A: Correct.  Apple  released  the  QuickTime  Plug-in  ActiveX  Control  way  back  when Microsoft  suddenly  dropped  support  for  Netscape-style  plug-ins  in  Internet  Explorer   IE  5.5. However, this ActiveX control was speciﬁcally designed just to replace the QuickTime plug-in in IE and lacked support for embedding in other COM ActiveX hosts such as Visual Basic.     So the starting point for developing QuickTime-based applications in the .NET and COM environments is the QuickTime Control. As we will discover in the next chapter, the QuickTime Control is really just the root of an exten- sive  QuickTime  Object  Model  that  becomes  available  to  us,  obviating  any need to go near the traditional C C++ QuickTime API.  Beginning  with  QuickTime  7.0.2,  the  Apple  QuickTime  Control  is installed and registered with QuickTime itself, so there is nothing additional to  install.  It  comprises  two  dynamic  link  libraries   DLLs :  QTOControl.dll,   which  is  the which  is  the  QuickTime  COM  Control,  and  COM library of QuickTime Objects. You will ﬁnd these DLLs in the  Program  folder or wherever you happen to have installed QuickTime. Files\QuickTime  QTOLibrary.dll,  38  Chapter 3   Using the QuickTime Control                       A COM Control in .NET?  The QuickTime Control is not a native managed code .NET control, nor could it ever really be since QuickTime itself does not run on the Common Language Runtime  CLR . How- ever,  the  .NET  Framework  has  excellent  support  for  COM  through  its  COM  Interop  ser- vices. In order to use a COM control or library in .NET, you must have what’s known as an Interop Assembly—essentially a .NET wrapper for the COM object. Visual Studio .NET will automatically  generate  these  Interop  Assemblies  when  you  add  a  COM  control  to  a project, and they will appear as Interop DLLs in the project bin folder.   To avoid the need for each project to hold its own private Interop wrappers for a COM component, a Primary Interop Assembly  PIA  is often supplied with the component and can be registered with the system. While not available at the time of writing, it is likely that Apple  will  provide  PIAs  for  the  QuickTime  Control  and  associated  QuickTime  Objects Library as part of the QuickTime 7 SDK.  Get the Big Picture  In common with all COM controls, the QuickTime Control is incapable of survival on its own and must reside within a host window known as its con- tainer—normally the form, dialog box, or other window that you provide as part of your application  Figure 3.1 . When embedded in its container win- dow, the QuickTime Control is allocated its own visual real estate as a child window of its host, or parent window.

However, within the conﬁnes of its own window, the QuickTime Con- trol becomes ﬁef of its own mini-QuickTime domain: virtually anything you could conceivably open with the QuickTime Player application can also be opened, played, viewed, edited, and generally mucked about with inside the QuickTime Control, and all under the control of your application.  Recall  the  extensive  collection  of  media  and  interactive  formats  that QuickTime  can  handle  and  you’ll  quickly  grasp  the  potential:  video  clips, sounds, music, animations, interactive  wired  movies, Flash movies, virtual reality  VR  scenes, and images, in a bewildering variety of formats and all capable  of  being  embedded,  controlled,  and  in  many  cases  even  edited within your application.  Whenever your form is loaded—at start-up for example—the QuickTime Control on that form gets loaded along with all the other controls you might have on the form. The control is allocated as an object in memory and is now referred  to  as  an    of  the  QuickTime  Control.  Whatever  name  you gave the control at design time  the default is    now refers to this instance of the control.

Movies  For anyone not familiar with QuickTime, a little digression on terminology is appropriate. Way back in the mists of time  1992 to be precise , QuickTime was  released  as  an  intriguing,  novel  technology  targeted  primarily  at  the playback of digital video, albeit at postage stamp size. It made sense to refer to the ﬁles that QuickTime could open as “movies,” and the .mov extension was born. In the intervening decade or so, QuickTime has evolved to handle  40  Chapter 3   Using the QuickTime Control                                                     a  diverse  array  of  digital  media  formats.  Once  opened,  each  of  these  for- mats—whether  a  sound  ﬁle,  an  MPEG  movie,  a  VR  scene,  or  even  a  text ﬁle—is treated democratically within QuickTime as a movie. The fact that this is possible at all speaks volumes for the farsighted extensibility built into QuickTime by its original architects. And so the    name sticks.  movie  In order to simplify the forthcoming discussion, I shall use the term   movie rather loosely to refer to anything that the QuickTime Control can sensibly open. With all this in mind let’s take a closer look at the facilities provided by the QuickTime Control for loading a movie and controlling the essential visual aspects of movie presentation.  Loading a Movie  URL  Our  gateway  to  the  world  of  movies  is,  not  altogether  surprisingly,  the QuickTime  Control’s    property.  Setting  this  property  tells  the  control which particular movie we wish to load and from where. A movie is, more often than not, simply a discrete ﬁle somewhere, say, on your hard disk or on a DVD-ROM. It can be fully speciﬁed by a local path to which the   prop- erty may be set:  URL  AxQTControl1.URL = "C:\My Movies\KidsPicnic.mov"  'Movie  AxQTControl1.URL = "D:\My Music\Blues.mp3"  'Sound  AxQTControl1.URL = "D:\My Pictures\Stawberries.jpg"  'Image  AxQTControl1.URL = "G:\Flash\PingPong.swf"  'Flash movie  However,  in  our  networked  world,  nothing  says  the  ﬁle  has  to  be  on  a local disk. The control will cope just as well with a UNC  Universal Naming Convention  path to a network share  AxQTControl1.URL = "\\Eeyore\D\My Movies\KidsRemotePicnic.mov"  or indeed with a URL to a ﬁle way out there somewhere on a server:  AxQTControl1.URL = "http:  www.blueplanet.com movies hello_world.mov"  AxQTControl1.URL = "http:  mww.redplanet.com movies hello_mars.mov"  Movies  41                                                                           And of course, the    property is not restricted to discrete ﬁles. Those 24x7 news junkies and Internet radio fans can point the URL at their favorite streaming channels:  URL  AxQTControl1.URL = "http:  stream.qtv.apple.com channels wcpe              sprites wcp_sprite.mov"  URL  The    property opens the door to digital media of all sorts, from local sources or remote servers, and embeds it right where we want it in our appli- cations.  Movie Scaling and Sizing  Once a movie is loaded, we invariably want some control over its size and position within the control. The QuickTime Control obliges with a number of useful properties and methods. Understanding how these work and inter- act  together  is  essential  if  you  want  to  ensure  that  your  application  copes well with movies of different shapes and sizes. Both scale and aspect ratio are important factors to take into account.  Scale   is the ratio of the movie’s normal size  width and height  to the size at which we wish to view the movie in our control. If the movie is very big, we may wish to view it at a reduced scale or, rather like QuickTime Player, we may wish to offer our users the ability to view a movie at Half Size, Nor- mal Size, or Double Size. Different screen resolutions may also mean that the usable area available to our application can vary enormously, and we there- fore need to scale the movie appropriately  Figure 3.2 .  Scale can be applied independently to the X and Y axes using the   ScaleX  and   ScaleY   properties, both of which take ﬂoating-point values:  AxQTControl1.ScaleX = 2.5 AxQTControl1.ScaleY = 4.956  Alternatively, as we saw in the last chapter, the    method can take either a single value applied to both X and Y axes, or separate X and Y values:  SetScale  AxQTControl1.SetScale 3.5  AxQTControl1.SetScale 2.5, 4.956   Aspect ratio   is the ratio of the width of a movie to its height. Computer screen resolutions have traditionally settled on a 4:3 aspect ratio  e.g., 640 x 480  pixels  or  1400  x  1050  pixels ,  while  movie-goers  have  become  accus-  42  Chapter 3   Using the QuickTime Control                     Figure 3.2  Scaling the movie.  Figure 3.3  Movie  captured  at  4:3  aspect  ratio   left   and  stretched  to  16:9   right .  Result:  peculiar- looking horse and fatter kids!  tomed to a  wide-screen  16:9 aspect ratio on the big screen. Depending on its source, digital content is liable to come in a variety of aspect ratios: con- sumer DV cameras typically churn out movies at 4:3, whereas movie trailers will usually reﬂect their 16:9 origins. Panoramic VR movies are often very wide indeed relative to their height.  Unlike scale, if we alter the aspect ratio, we usually end up introducing undesirable geometric distortion. If you have ever watched an old big-screen movie that has been converted to video format for television, you may have noticed the effect  Figure 3.3 .  Aspect ratio and scale are intimately related: changing the aspect ratio is in fact just scaling the width differently from the height. In most situations we will want to avoid changes to the aspect ratio even if we choose to scale the movie.  Movies  43                                                             Sizing  The    property of the control determines how it handles both size and aspect ratio. There are several options to which it may be set as enumer- ated in    and illustrated in Figures 3.4 and 3.5.  QTSizingModeEnum  1.  qtControlFitsMovie : The control resizes itself to ﬁt the natural size of the movie, taking into account any applied X and Y scaling. Aspect ratio is preserved, unless of course you deliberately force it to change by applying different scale values to the width and height.  Use this option if you need to display a movie at its natural size, or if you need to be able to apply manual scaling. While this sizing option might appear to be an automatic choice, your carefully laid-out user interface is  Figure 3.4  Sizing options:  left   FitsControlMaintainAspectRatio  qtControlFitsMovie  .  ,  center    qtMovieFitsControl  ,  right    qtMovie-  Figure 3.5  Sizing option:   qtMovieCenteredInControl  .  44  Chapter 3   Using the QuickTime Control                                                    at  the  mercy  of  whatever  movies—large  or  small,  fat  or  thin—that  your user might choose to load. This is the default sizing option for the Quick- Time Control. qtMovieFitsControl :  The  movie  is  automatically  sized  to  ﬁt  within  the qtCon- bounds of the control—in effect, the logical opposite of option 1,  trolFitsMovie . Both scale and aspect ratio are no longer at your discretion since they are slavishly driven by the control as it keeps the movie cor- ralled. The use of this sizing option is limited to cases where you simply must ensure that the control remains a ﬁxed size and where you couldn’t give a toss  about  aspect  ratio.  Either  that  or  all  your  movies  are  of  a  known aspect ratio  e.g., 4:3  and you deliberately preset the size of the control to accommodate them. qtMovieFitsControlMaintainAspectRatio :  As  you  might  guess  from  the qtMovieFitsCon- name, this is essentially a smarter variation on option 2,  trol . Instead of blindly ﬁlling the entire control, this option seeks to dis- play  as  much  as  possible  of  the  movie  in  the  available  space  while  its aspect ratio. Depending on whether the aspect ratio of the preserving movie is greater than or less than that of the control, the result is a movie centered vertically in the available space with gaps above and below, or centered  horizontally  with  gaps  to  each  side.  Either  way  the  movie  is scaled to ﬁt into the available space without geometrical distortion, and any resulting gaps are ﬁlled with the control’s background color. If your carefully laid-out form has a well-deﬁned space in which the con- trol should sit and display movies irrespective of their natural size  e.g., a preview window for movies , this is the sizing option to go for. qtMovieCenteredInControl : The movie is positioned so that the center of the movie is in the center of the control, irrespective of the size of the con- trol or the size of the movie  Figure 3.5 . The control size never changes, and no attempt is made to constrain the movie within the bounds of the control:  1  if the movie is too big for the control, we see only part of it;  2  if the movie is too small, the control background color will ﬁll any space surrounding the movie. Both aspect ratio and scale are retained; changes to scale simply determine how much or how little of the movie is visible. This  option  can  be  useful  where  the  control  ﬁlls  an  area  that  is  much larger than the movie and where you want to position the movie centrally in that area. qtManualSizing : Here, the control absolves itself of all responsibility for sizing and leaves it entirely up to you. Not a lot of use, and presumably here just for completeness.  2.  3.  4.  5.  Movies  45                             A Resizeable Window for Simple Player  1  qtControlFitsMovie  Our  Simple  Player  as  developed  in  the  last  chapter  implicitly  used  sizing option 1, the default  , and we arranged for the applica- tion  window  size  to  be  dictated  by  the  control  size.  Imagine  now  that  we want our application window to be resizeable so that, once a movie is loaded and  displayed  at  its  natural  size,  the  movie  can  then  be  scaled  simply  by dragging the window’s resize handle  Figure 3.6 .  To achieve this, we must switch from the default situation we had in the last chapter, where the movie dictates the size of the control and hence the size of the window, to essentially the reverse; that is, the size of the resize- able window now governs the size of the control, which in turn scales the movie.  However,  in  order  to  have  the  movie  display    at  its  default size,  we  have  to  start  off  with  Sizing  set  to  qtControlFitsMovie.  Then  as soon as we’ve loaded the movie, we change Sizing to qtMovieFitsControl:  initially  'Initially resize control to fit movie AxQTControl1.Sizing = QTSizingModeEnum.qtControlFitsMovie  If OpenFileDialog1.ShowDialog   = DialogResult.OK Then    AxQTControl1.URL = OpenFileDialog1.FileName      'Once we've loaded movie, its size is determined by control size   AxQTControl1.Sizing = QTSizingModeEnum.qtMovieFitsControl  End If  End Sub  But there’s more to it than that. The control will not resize unless we tie it into the parent’s form’s SizeChanged event, which is ﬁred whenever we drag its resize handle:  Private Sub Form1_SizeChanged ...  Handles MyBase.SizeChanged    AxQTControl1.Size = Me.ClientSize  1  This sample is available on the website at www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples SimplePlayer.  46  Chapter 3   Using the QuickTime Control   Figure 3.6 Resizing the Simple Player window.  Astute readers may spot a potential problem here. Consider this: the user resizes the form, which then resizes the control in Form1_SizeChanged. The control in turn ﬁres its own SizeChanged event, for which you’ll recall we have a handler AxQTControl1_SizeChanged that resizes the form once again. And so it proceeds around in circles potentially ad inﬁnitum, a classic race condition. The simplest way to put a stop to this nonsense is to set a ﬂag in Form1_SizeChanged  that  politely  tells  AxQTControl1_SizeChanged  to  ignore SizeChanged events if the window is being resized. First, we declare a mem- ber variable in our Form1 class to act as the ﬂag:  Private m_bExternalSizeChange As Boolean  Then we set the ﬂag to True while we change the size of the control:  Private Sub Form1_SizeChanged ...  Handles MyBase.SizeChanged    m_bExternalSizeChange = True   AxQTControl1.Size = Me.ClientSize   m_bExternalSizeChange = False  End Sub  Movies 47   Finally, we ignore SizeChanged events if the ﬂag is set:  Private Sub AxQTControl1_SizeChanged ...  Handles              AxQTControl1.SizeChanged    'Ignore events triggered by Form1_SizeChanged   If m_bExternalSizeChange Then Exit Sub     Me.ClientSize = AxQTControl1.Size  End Sub  End Sub  End Sub  One further detail remains to be tidied up in our resizeable Simple Player. If we want the Scale 1X and Scale 2X menu items to work as before, we need to force the Sizing property temporarily back to qtControlFitsMovie, other- wise our scale changes will have no effect. Remember qtMovieFitsControl ignores attempts to change scale:  Private Sub mnuScale1x_Click ...  Handles mnuScale1x.Click    AxQTControl1.Sizing = QTSizingModeEnum.qtControlFitsMovie   AxQTControl1.SetScale 1     '1X   AxQTControl1.Sizing = QTSizingModeEnum.qtMovieFitsControl  Private Sub mnuScale2x_Click ...  Handles mnuScale2x.Click    AxQTControl1.Sizing = QTSizingModeEnum.qtControlFitsMovie   AxQTControl1.SetScale 2     '2X   AxQTControl1.Sizing = QTSizingModeEnum.qtMovieFitsControl  Incidentally, this illustrates how sometimes Sizing can be usefully changed on the ﬂy and not just set before a movie is loaded.  48 Chapter 3 Using the QuickTime Control   The QTOControlLib Namespace  If you try some of the preceding code examples, you may be perturbed to ﬁnd that your code throws up build errors:  Name QTSizingModeEnum is not declared.  Before you accuse me of not bothering to check my code samples, let me hasten to point out that I have simpliﬁed the code by importing the QuickTime Control’s namespace at the top of the Form1.vb code module, giving all code in the form access to all the mem- bers of QTOControlLib, including its various enumerations:  Imports QTOControlLib  Public Class Form1   Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form  This means that I can use code like  AxQTControl1.Sizing = QTSizingModeEnum.qtControlFitsMovie  instead of the considerably more unwieldy  AxQTControl1.Sizing =              QTOControlLib.QTSizingModeEnum.qtControlFitsMovie  In C, reference the namespace with the using directive at the top of Form1.cs:  using QTOControlLib;  namespace QTHelloWorld {   public class Form1 : System.Windows.Forms.Form  Background and Border  Visual controls such as the QuickTime Control traditionally offer control over  background  color  and  a  facility  to  have  a  border  drawn  around  the control.  You  could  be  forgiven  for  wondering  why  background  color  is  relevant once a movie is loaded: in many cases it isn’t relevant since the movie ﬁlls the  control  completely  but,  as  we  saw  in  the  discussion  of  sizing  options,  Movies 49   there are situations where the movie does not completely ﬁll the bounds of the  control,  leaving  gaps  that  will  be  painted  with  the  background  color. There will also be situations where the control is visible but has no movie loaded. The BackColor property allows us to set this background to any stan- dard color or indeed any arbitrary ARGB  alpha, red, green, blue  value:  AxQTControl1.BackColor = Color.Aquamarine AxQTControl1.BackColor = Color.FromArgb 120, 255, 0, 0      C AxQTControl1.BackColor = Color.FromArgb 0x49,0x99,0xFF ;  In  practice  we  often  want  to  set  the  background  color  of  the  control  to that of its parent form so that it blends in whenever no movie is loaded or when  there  are  gaps  around  the  movie.  You  may  already  have  discovered that  whenever  you  drop  a  QuickTime  Control  on  a  form,  its  background color is automatically set to that of the form.  The BorderStyle property offers three options  Figure 3.7  that are pretty  much self-explanatory:    cid:2  bsNone: No border—useful with background color set to match that of the  form so that your movie blends into the form.   cid:2  bsPlain: A single-pixel border—often set to a subdued color to set off your  movies.   cid:2  bs3D: A sunken, beveled border for that genuine Windows look.  Figure 3.7 The QuickTime Control’s border options: bsNone, bsPlain, and bs3D.  50 Chapter 3 Using the QuickTime Control   The BorderColor property only applies when BorderStyle is bsPlain and  can be set to any System.Drawing.Color value as with BackColor.  AxQTControl1.BorderColor = Color.DarkGoldenrod AxQTControl1.BorderStyle = BorderStylesEnum.bsPlain  Movie Controller  A critical design decision in any application involving QuickTime movies is whether or not to display the movie controller bar, or just plain “movie con- troller” as it’s commonly called. Unless you are providing your own custom playback  controls,  the  movie  controller  will  be  essential  if  your  users  are going  to  be  able  to  start,  stop,  rewind,  or  step  frame-by-frame  forward  or backward through the movie. Sometimes, of course, all you want is to play the movie without any user interaction, in which case the movie controller is irrelevant.  But What Is a Movie Controller?  If you are new to QuickTime, then you may wonder what exactly a movie controller is and why anyone would want to hide one! Well, the movie controller is simply the little control  progress bar that QuickTime displays immediately underneath a movie, as shown in Figure 3.8. As well as indicating progress, it provides basic facilities for controlling playback: start, stop,  step  forward,  step  back,  plus  the  ability  to  slide  the  playback  position  forward  or back or, in the jargon, to scrub the movie. If your movie has a sound track, you’ll ﬁnd that the movie controller also sports a volume control.  The movie controller bar may in fact appear quite different depending on the type of media loaded into the control. For example, load a QuickTime VR movie and you will get a very different movie controller with all the controls you need to navigate inside a virtual environment.  Figure 3.8 Examples of movie controller bars.  Movies 51   Fortunately, turning the movie controller on and off is a dawdle using the MovieControllerVisible Boolean property. You can toggle the movie control- ler at any time or ensure that it is off prior to loading a movie if you don’t need it:  AxQTControl1.MovieControllerVisible = False AxQTControl1.URL = "D:\My Movies\TitanFlyby.mov"  One  fact  worth  mentioning  at  this  point  is  that  the  movie  controller  is always exactly 16 pixels tall. This is taken into account by the control when- ever  it  sizes  itself  to  ﬁt  the  movie  in  the qtControlFitsMovie  sizing  mode. You  can  easily  verify  this  by  adding  the  following  line  after  the  movie  is loaded:  Dim mcHeight = AxQTControl1.Height - AxQTControl1.Movie.Height Debug.WriteLine CStr mcHeight    The value of mcHeight is the difference between the control’s height and the height of the movie that it contains.  Auto Play  In many situations the obvious next step after loading a movie is to play it. In keeping with its tradition of saving developers from superﬂuous typing, the QuickTime  Control  provides  an AutoPlay  property  that,  when  set  to True, will automatically start playing the movie once it is loaded. This is especially convenient  if  you  need  sounds  or  music  in  your  application:  just  place  a QuickTime  Control  on  your  form   even  a  hidden  control  will  do ,  set AutoPlay = True, load any audio ﬁle, and it will proceed to play immediately.  Control over Full-Screen Display  In the last chapter we saw how easy it is to ﬂick the control into eye-popping full-screen display mode using the FullScreen property:  AxQTControl1.FullScreen = True  Finer control over this display mode is provided by a number of additional properties of the control.  52 Chapter 3 Using the QuickTime Control   By  default,  you  exit  full-screen  mode  by  hitting  the  Escape   Esc   key, which seems logical enough. However, your application might use the Esc key for some other purpose or you may prefer to use a function key instead. As its name suggests, the FullScreenEndKeyCode property allows us to deﬁne any key code we like as the means of escape:  AxQTControl1.FullScreenEndKeyCode = Keys.F2  AxQTControl1.FullScreenEndKeyCode = Keys.Space  Full-screen  mode  has  its  own  sizing  property  FullScreenSizing  that  is independent  of  the  sizing  mode  the  control  exerts.  In  most  cases  you  will want to set FullScreenSizing to preserve the movie aspect ratio:  AxQTControl1.FullScreenSizing = QTFullScreenSizingModeEnum.             qtFullScreenMovieFitsControlMaintainAspectRatio  Given that all you probably want to do in full-screen mode is just watch the movie, the cursor can be an irritating distraction. We can easily get rid of it by setting a ﬂag in the FullScreenFlags property:  AxQTControl1.FullScreenFlags = QTFullScreenFlagsEnum.              qtFullScreenFlagHideCursor  If your system supports multiple monitors as many now do, it's even pos-  sible to direct the full-screen output to a monitor of your choice:  AxQTControl1.FullScreenMonitorNumber = 2  This property can be set to any number from 1 to the number of active monitors on your system, but setting it will fail if the monitor number does not exist. Since it's not uncommon for additional monitors to be unplugged or otherwise unavailable, it's worth using SystemInformation to do a quick check on the actual number of monitors before setting this property:  If  monitorNumber > 0  And  monitorNumber <=              SystemInformation.MonitorCount  Then    AxQTControl1.FullScreenMonitorNumber = monitorNumber Else   AxQTControl1.FullScreenMonitorNumber = 1 End If  Movies 53   One thing to beware of with full-screen display is the effect it may have on the scale of the movie. When entering full-screen mode, the QuickTime Control scales the movie to ﬁt the screen according to the sizing mode speci- ﬁed  in  the  FullScreenSizing  property.  On  leaving  full-screen  mode,  how- ever, the original movie scale is not explicitly restored. If the Sizing mode of the  control  is  set  to  qtMovieFitsControl  or  qtMovieFitsControlMaintain- AspectRatio, then this is not a problem since the movie will immediately be scaled to ﬁt the control, which, of course, is the same size as it was before the full-screen interlude. But if the control Sizing is set to qtControlFits- Movie  or  qtMovieCenteredInControl,  then  you're  in  for  a  shock  when  you drop out of full-screen mode: the movie scale will remain exactly as it was in full-screen mode.   One  solution  to  this  problem  would  be  to  restore  the  movie  scale  after leaving full-screen mode, but how might we know when this has happened? We can't use the SizeChanged event of the control since the control hasn't changed size. Fortunately, another event comes to our rescue: the StatusUp- date event of the QuickTime Control. This event is triggered for a variety of reasons including entering and leaving full-screen mode. The available Sta- tusUpdate codes are found in QTStatusCodesEnum, and the pair we are inter- ested in is qtStatusFullScreenBegin and qtStatusFullScreenEnd. Below is a StatusUpdate event handler showing how the X and Y scales are saved upon entering full-screen mode and then restored on exit:  Private Sub AxQTControl1_StatusUpdate ...  Handles              AxQTControl1.StatusUpdate    Static scaleX As Single, scaleY As Single    Select Case e.statusCode      Case QTStatusCodesEnum.qtStatusFullScreenBegin       scaleX = AxQTControl1.ScaleX       scaleY = AxQTControl1.ScaleY      Case QTStatusCodesEnum.qtStatusFullScreenEnd       AxQTControl1.SetScale scaleX, scaleY     End Select  End Sub  54 Chapter 3 Using the QuickTime Control   Initializing QuickTime  One of the ﬁrst things that traditional QuickTime developers using the C API often  learn  the  hard  way  is  that  QuickTime  must  be initialized,  or  loaded, before you can expect it to do anything useful. If you are already familiar with this concept, you may be wondering how we seem to have gotten so far without  ever  mentioning  this!  Well,  the  good  news  is  that  QuickTime  is being initialized for us by the QuickTime Control just at the right time so that we never have to worry about it, and it is unloaded behind the scenes as well. This is component technology at its best: ease of use is preeminent and the intricacies of a particular technology are not allowed to get in the way.  If  you  happen  to  have  sneakily  jumped  way  ahead  and  looked  more closely  at  the  QuickTime  Control  interface,  say,  in  Object  Browser,  you might interrupt at this point: If the QuickTime Control really is so smart as to  load  and  unload  QuickTime  when  it  needs  to,  how  come  it  has Quick- TimeInitialize and QuickTimeTerminate methods?  That’s  a  good  question,  and  to  answer  it  we  have  to  look  a  little  more closely at how the QuickTime Control manages its relationship with Quick- Time itself. Three key points to bear in mind are  1. QuickTime  need  be  initialized  only once  by  your  application,  or  strictly speaking by any process, irrespective of how many movies the application might have open.  2. The QuickTime Control can be loaded by your application without having to load QuickTime itself, for example, when the control’s container form gets loaded. The QuickTime Control should not be confused with Quick- Time itself—the control just loads QuickTime whenever it needs to. This is important to grasp.  3. Once  loaded  by  a  process,  QuickTime  maintains  an  internal  reference count  on  the  number  of  times  that  it  is  initialized  and  terminated.  This means  that  we  shouldn’t  be  shy  about  calling QuickTimeInitialize  and QuickTimeTerminate multiple times within our applications: only the very ﬁrst call to QuickTimeInitialize and the very last call to QuickTimeTermi- nate will have any effect.  When the QuickTime Control is loaded as part of your form, it doesn’t need QuickTime until such time as you tell it to do something that involves QuickTime. So you can happily change the border style or the background color and the control doesn’t have to trouble with QuickTime since these are incidental properties of the control that do not require QuickTime. However,  Initializing QuickTime 55   the  moment  you  go  to  load  a  movie,  the  control  suddenly  has  to  do  some heavy lifting, and so it invokes QuickTime.  There are good reasons, however, for why we might wish to be more in control  of  when  and  how  QuickTime  gets  loaded  and  unloaded.  Here  are three:  1. Disguising  load  time:  Most  users  will  tolerate  a  reasonable  start-up delay when an application launches. Just throw up the hourglass cursor and they will contentedly wait. However, the very same users will curse any  irritating  delays  that  occur  once  the  application  is  up  and  running. Loading QuickTime for the ﬁrst time does take a few seconds, especially on slower systems, and it is often easiest to bury this in with the general application loading overhead. This is where QuickTimeInitialize comes in:  we  can  call  this  method  to  initialize  QuickTime  within  our  start-up code. In simple Visual Basic applications, a handy place to do this is in the form Load event handler of the main application window:  Private Sub Form1_Load ...  Handles MyBase.Load    Cursor.Current = Cursors.WaitCursor     AxQTControl1.Location = New System.Drawing.Point 0, 0    AxQTControl1.BorderStyle = BorderStylesEnum.bsNone   AxQTControl1.MovieControllerVisible = True    AxQTControl1.QuickTimeInitialize          'Load QuickTime    Cursor.Current = Cursors.Default  End Sub  Whenever our application quits and the process is killed, QuickTime will get unloaded anyhow. However, it is still good practice to do this explicitly using QuickTimeTerminate as part of an orderly shut-down sequence, for example, in our form’s Closed event handler: Private Sub Form1_Closed ...  Handles MyBase.Closed    AxQTControl1.URL = ""  End Sub    AxQTControl1.QuickTimeTerminate           'Unload QuickTime  56 Chapter 3 Using the QuickTime Control   2. Handling load errors: It is unlikely, but not inconceivable, that Quick- Time may fail to load for some reason. Perhaps the version is too old and not  compatible  with  the  QuickTime  Control  or  the  installation  may  be corrupt  or  damaged.  If  our  application  depends  heavily  on  QuickTime, this could be catastrophic and we would be well advised to break the bad news during start-up checks. Fortunately, QuickTimeInitialize returns an integer error code that we can check, and any failure can be intelligently reported back to the user: Private Sub Form1_Load ...  Handles MyBase.Load    Dim loadError as Integer    Cursor.Current = Cursors.WaitCursor     AxQTControl1.Location = New System.Drawing.Point 0, 0    AxQTControl1.BorderStyle = BorderStylesEnum.bsNone   AxQTControl1.MovieControllerVisible = True    'Load QuickTime   loadError = AxQTControl1.QuickTimeInitialize     Cursor.Current = Cursors.Default    'Check for error: report and exit if failed   If loadError   0 Then     MsgBox "Unable to load QuickTime! Error: " + CStr loadError ,              MsgBoxStyle.Critical      Application.Exit    'Abort   End If  End Sub  3. Conﬁguring QuickTime: You may have noticed that QuickTimeInitial- ize has a couple of optional parameters. We can safely ignore InitOptions  just pass zero , but InitFlags allows us to conﬁgure QuickTime in ways that may be useful under certain circumstances by passing one or more ﬂags as deﬁned in QTInitializeQTMLFlagsEnum. For example, if for some reason we wish to completely disable sound output from QuickTime we could call AxQTControl1.QuickTimeInitialize 0,             QTInitializeQTMLFlagsEnum.qtInitializeQTMLFlagNoSound   Initializing QuickTime 57   In general, you shouldn’t need to concern yourself with these initializa- tion ﬂags, but every now and again they can be very useful, especially dur- ing development.  Is QuickTime Available?  Whenever a user launches your application, the mere presence of the Quick- Time Control  QTOControl.dll  is no real guarantee that QuickTime itself is necessarily  installed  on  the  system.  The  IsQuickTimeAvailable  property checks  for  the  presence  of  QuickTime  and  returns  True  if  available.  You must pass a howToCheck parameter with this property, which determines how thorough the check for QuickTime will be:  0:  1:  does not attempt to initialize QuickTime but merely checks for the presence of QuickTime.qts.  a more thorough check for QuickTime involving an attempt to ini- tialize it  IsQuickTimeAvailable 0  is clearly the more useful option in this context,  and should generally precede any attempt to call QuickTimeInitialize.  Note While IsQuickTimeAvailable is a property, it is a parameterized property, and as such is not  available  in  C.  Instead,  it  can  be  accessed  through  property  accessor  method get_IsQuickTimeAvailable.  Probing Deeper  In  Simple  Player  we  already  touched  brieﬂy  on  the Movie  property  of  the control.  We  saw  that  this  property  exposes  an  object  that  represents  the movie that we have currently loaded into the control. As we have seen so far in  this  chapter,  the  control  takes  care  of  loading  and  presentation  of  the movie. If we want to obtain information about the movie itself or to manipu- late  it,  then  we  must  work  through  the Movie  object,  a  child  object  of  the control:  movieLength = AxQTControl1.Movie.Duration  AxQTControl1.Movie.Time = 2000  58 Chapter 3 Using the QuickTime Control   Similarly,  if  we  want  to  check  the  QuickTime  version  or  twiddle  with  QuickTime settings, then we turn to the QuickTime property of the control:  qtVersion = AxQTControl1.QuickTime.Version  This should be enough to convince you that the QuickTime Control war- rants a lot more exploration beneath the surface. The extensive object model exposed  via  the  Movie  and  QuickTime  properties  is  the  subject  of  the  next chapter.  Summary  Whatever way you choose to integrate QuickTime into your application, you will want the user experience to be smooth and seamless. Achieving this in any  nontrivial  application  will  depend  very  much  on  how  thoroughly  you understand the various presentation options available within the QuickTime Control and how these interact with your application. This is especially true if your user has free reign to load media of arbitrary size and type. Once you master the intricacies, though, you should be able to achieve very tight inte- gration,  with  the  added  bonus  of  some  sophisticated  features  such  as full-screen playback.  Summary 59                                      4  The QuickTime Object Model 4  Introduction  In 1976 Tim Severin set out from Ireland with some doughty companions in a leather-covered boat to sail—or rather, hoping to be driven by wind and current—across the North Atlantic. His objective was to inject some reality into the intriguing legends of the sixth-century Irish monk St. Brendan, who was supposed to have visited America hundreds of years before Columbus. Amongst many adventures before their eventual landfall in Newfoundland, Severin recounts several thrilling encounters with ice: deceptively small and benign-looking above the water but deadly below, especially when all that 1 separates you from the cold sea is a quarter-inch-thick skin of cowhide.  So far in the last two chapters we have been paddling around carefully studying  the  most  obvious  features  of  the  QuickTime  Control—the  bits above the water. But every now and again, we’ve stumbled across something like the   object, hinting at greater things below. In this chapter we get to grips with the underlying library of QuickTime objects that lies beneath the surface.  Movie  Before getting down to the detail, we should pause to acquaint—or per- haps reacquaint—ourselves with the concept of an object model. If you are already  familiar  with  object  models,  such  as  the  Document  Object  Model  DOM , you may choose to skip over the next section.  1  The Brendan Voyage,   Tim Severin. London: Arrow, 1979.  61                                                                Object Models  One of the most useful concepts to come out of the object-oriented program- ming paradigm is that of the object model. An object model is essentially a conceptual representation of a system in terms of its constituent objects and their relationships: a rather terse theoretical deﬁnition for what is in fact a very straightforward and eminently practical concept that can be applied to any system.   The compact bundle of ﬂesh and bones writing this book is as good an  example as any.  Our  bodies  comprise  a  torso,  a  collection  of  limbs   usually  four ,  and  a head  usually one . Applying the object model terminology  Figure 4.1 , we can treat the head and torso as simple child objects of the body. If we can regard our collection of limbs as an object, then we can say that our Limbs collection  has  four  child  objects,  each  of  which  is  a  Limb.  Notice  that  the Limb object comes in two ﬂavors:   Limb objects, but notwithstanding, they are all limbs.   Limb objects and   arm  leg  Now if we take any Limb object, either arm or leg, we know that it con- tains a number of joints and a number of bones. Let’s call them the Joints collection and the Bones collection. In the Joints collection we have elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles—all Joint objects of various kinds. Rattling around in our Bones collection are Bone objects such as the femur, tibia, humerus, and other reminders of high school biology.  This skeletal example illustrates the key concepts of the object model:    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   The system is broken down into subobjects. Some subobjects can be conveniently grouped into collections of objects that share certain characteristics. Collection objects contain a number of child objects all of the same type. Subobjects themselves may be further broken down.  An object model could conceivably be extended down almost to the   th n degree as each object is in turn decomposed into its subobjects. Imagine tak- ing our human body model down to the cellular level!  The Component Object Model  COM  standard is speciﬁcally designed to facilitate the implementation of abstract object models such as the one just described. Each object that we have identiﬁed in our model can be imple- mented as a COM object. A COM collection, as the name implies, is itself a COM object that deﬁnes a collection of other COM objects. A COM collec-  property that returns the number of items in the tion has a mandatory   Count  62  Chapter 4   The QuickTime Object Model                      Human Body  Head  Torso  Limbs  Limb  left arm   Joints  Joint  elbow   Bones  Bone  humerus   Joint  wrist   Bone  radius   Bone  ulna   Joint  knee   Joint  ankle   Bone  tibia   Bone  fibula   Bones  Bone  femur   Limb  left leg   Joints  Limb  right arm   Limb  right leg   Figure 4.1  The Human Body object model.  collection, together with a mandatory  item of the collection—usually by index or by name.

The .NET environ- ment builds on the success of COM: the entire .NET Framework is in fact  Object Models  63                         one giant object model, exposing much of the Windows API in the form of a hierarchy of .NET objects and collections of objects. Just bring up the .NET Object Browser  View  Object Browser, or Ctrl-Alt-J , choose any of the Sys- tem assemblies, and you’ll see what I mean.  It’s only to be expected then that both Visual Basic and C facilitate the creation of a set of objects and collections that implement an object model, allowing us to write code such as  Dim myBody As New HumanBody Dim myLimb As Limb  For Each myLimb In myBody.Limbs   If  Not myLimb.Joints 1 .Sprained  Then     myLimb.PutIn     myLimb.PutOut     myLimb.PutIn     myLimb.ShakeItAllAbout     myBody.DoHokeyPokey     myBody.Rotate   End If End If  As  we  can  see  from  this  hypothetical  code,  a  well-designed  object  model allows us to represent the structure of an object-oriented system in a conve- nient and intuitive form.  Since many types of documents are comprised of hierarchies of objects, they can often be modeled using a document object model. By far the best- known of these is the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  Document Object Model   DOM   that  describes  an  HTML  page,  starting  with  the  document itself as the root object and extending through a hierarchy of child objects to every individual HTML element on the page. If you have ever used JavaS- cript on a web page, you have encountered the DOM.  The QuickTime Object Model  QuickTime has long boasted a component-based architecture that lends itself to being expressed in an object model format. The QuickTime COM Control and its associated library of QuickTime COM objects exposes this underly- ing  structure  in  the  .NET  and  COM  environment  through  the  QuickTime Object Model as depicted in Figure 4.2.   64  Chapter 4   The QuickTime Object Model   QTControl  QTMovie  Objects that implement IQTObject  QTChapters  QTChapter  QTTracks  QTTrack  QTVRNodes  QTVRNode       QTStreams  QTStream  QTHotspots  QTHotspot  QTFrequencyMeter  QTQuickTime  QTSettings  QTEventObject  QTExporters  QTExporter  IQTObject  QTEventListeners  CFObjects  CFObject  QTOControlLib  QTUtils  QTMatrix  QTOLibrary  Figure 4.2  The QuickTime Object Model as exposed by the QuickTime Control and Object Library.                                                                                          Window  Document  QTControl  QTMovie  Figure 4.3   DOM Window Document model analogous to   QTControl QTMovie  .  Every hierarchical object model grows out of one or more root objects. In our anatomical example, the Human Body object is the root object, and we can only get at Limbs and Joints by starting with the root object. Similarly, in the W3C Document Object Model  DOM  the Document object is at the root of  the  entire  hierarchical  object  model:  we  can  only  get  at  individual  ele- ments of an HTML form by starting with the Document itself.  Referring  to  the  QuickTime  Object  Model  as  shown  in  Figure  4.2,  and applying  the  DOM  analogy,  it  is  obvious  that  the  QuickTime  Control,  or QTControl ,  which wraps the movie that was opened in the control, is essentially equivalent to the Document root object  Figure 4.3 .   ,  is  the  equivalent  of  the  Window  object,  while   QTMovie  QTQuickTime    is  the  root  object  that  enshrines  QuickTime  itself.  Both QTMovie  expose a hierarchy of underlying objects. We will devote the remainder of this chapter to exploring these two objects in detail.  QTQuickTime   and   QTMovie and Its Offspring  The Movie: QTMovie  QTControl  In the last two chapters we saw how the QuickTime Control COM object— or, more precisely, the   object—manages the opening of a Quick- Time  movie  and  its  visual  presentation  within  the  container  form  or  win- dow. Once a movie has been successfully opened by the   object, QTMovie the  child object that represents the movie itself:  QTControl  can be used to gain access to the    property of   QTControl  Movie  66  Chapter 4   The QuickTime Object Model   The properties and methods of   QTMovie   provide us with powerful control  over many aspects of the movie. Let's have a look at a few.                                                                     Dim myMovie as QTMovie  myMovie = AxQTControl1.Movie  Playback Control Playing a movie couldn’t be simpler:  AxQTControl1.Movie.Play    as is stopping the movie:  AxQTControl1.Movie.Stop    and rewinding the movie when we’re done:  AxQTControl1.Movie.Rewind    There  are  sometimes  cases  where  we  might  wish  to  speed  up  or  slow movieRate down playback.

For example, you might be using a QuickTime movie as a conve- nient means of storing a collection of still images and wish to be able to step between them. This is where the    methods come in handy:  Step  Dim myMovie as QTMovie myMovie = AxQTControl1.Movie  myMovie.StepFwd   myMovie.StepRev   myMovie.Step 6  myMovie.Step -16   'Step forward one frame 'Step back one frame 'Step forward 6 frames 'Step back 16 frames  The QuickTime Object Model  67                                                                                                   Precise control over movie playback position may be achieved using the  Time   property:  Dim nSaveTime as Long  nSaveTime = myMovie.Time              'Save current location myMovie.Time = 5000                   'Jump to time 5000  The   Duration    property  provides  the  overall  length  of  the  movie  so,  for  prop-  example, to go to the end of the movie, all we have to do is set the  erty equal to the   Duration  Time  :  myMovie.Time = myMovie.Duration       'Jump to end of movie  Movie Time and Movie Time Scale  and other Quick- The value obtained from time-based properties of  , can often be puzzling when you ﬁrst Time objects, such as  start  using  QuickTime.

All  of  the  time-based  properties  of  a  movie  or  a  track  are,  in  fact,  So what is movie time and how do I relate time  that is the number of units of movie time per second. The time scale Movie.TimeScale  expressed in units of  it to something concrete? Well, movie time is deﬁned by an arbitrary  scale is a property of the movie and may be obtained from the  property.  So converting any movie time to seconds is trivial:  Time  seconds   =  Time  units of movie time  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Movie time scale  =  Movie.Time  --------------------------------------------- Movie.TimeScale  Here it is in code:  Dim myTimeInSeconds As Single myTimeInSeconds = myMovie.Time   myMovie.TimeScale  As an example, if a movie reported a duration of 1920 and a time scale of 600, then it would be 1920 600 = 3.2 seconds long.   The   time scale   of a movie can be any arbitrary number of units per second. In practice, the time scale is usually chosen for convenience in working with common video frame rates so that the number of units of movie time per frame is a whole number. The default is often 600 movie time units per sec-  68  Chapter 4   The QuickTime Object Model                         ond, which works well with a range of frame rates such as 30, 25, 24, 15, 12.5, 12, 10, and 8 frames per second  fps .  If a movie has a ﬁxed frame rate, then the time per frame can easily be  worked out:  Movie time units per frame  =  Movie time scale ---------------------------------------------------- Frames per second   For example, if a movie is 15 fps and has a time scale of 600, then advanc-  ing one frame is equivalent to advancing 40 units of movie time.  Tip  In general it is best to work in movie time rather than converting to and from seconds or milliseconds, unless you have a very deﬁnite reason to do so. Bear in mind that while many movies do indeed use the default time scale of 600, you should not depend on this: if you need the time scale then always explicitly load it from the movie in question.  Playing Selections Cases often arise where you only want to play a part of a movie, perhaps one particular  clip  of  a  longer  sequence  or  one  verse  of  a  song.  One  rather simple-minded way of doing this would be to jump to the desired start time, Play the movie, and then repeatedly check the Time property of the movie, calling Stop whenever the desired end point has been reached. Such a poll- ing technique is clearly rather tedious, and latency could mean that we don’t quite stop precisely where we want to.  This  is  one  situation  where  the  selection  properties  of  the  movie  come into  play:  just  set  the  SelectionStart  and  SelectionEnd  properties  to  the start and end times, respectively, of the clip we wish to play and then set the movie’s PlaySelectionOnly property to True.  myMovie.SelectionStart = 1500 myMovie.SelectionEnd = 2500 myMovie.PlaySelectionOnly = True  duration of the selection:  myMovie.SetSelection 1500, 1000  myMovie.PlaySelectionOnly = True  Alternatively,  we  can  use  the SetSelection  method  to  set  the  start  and  'Alternative – same effect  Now when we Play or Rewind the movie, all the action is conﬁned to the selection. And if we were to set Looping to True, the selection would play over and over repeatedly.  The QuickTime Object Model  69   This turns out to be a particularly useful facility in many interactive situa- tions: imagine we have a movie that contains the full 123 minutes of the Euro 2004 quarter-ﬁnal  soccer, in case you don’t know  between Portugal, playing at home, and England. With two goals during normal time, two in extra time, and a nail-biting penalty shoot-out to follow, there is no shortage of action, including  a  hilarious   or  notorious  if  you’re  English!   penalty  miss  by England captain Beckham. We want to give our users the opportunity to pick any  one  of  these  highlights  and  view  it.  All  we  need  to  do  is  to  create  an array containing the start time and length of each of the highlights. When the user  chooses  a  highlight,  say,  from  a  menu,  we  just  use  the SetSelection method  to  simultaneously  set  the  start  time  and  duration  for  the  selected highlight from our array and then execute the Play method:  Sub PlayHighlight ByVal n As Integer     myMovie.SetSelection m_arrayHighlights n, 0 ,                         m_arrayHighlights n, 1     myMovie.PlaySelectionOnly = True   myMovie.Play    End Sub  You may encounter similar situations where it is more convenient to keep many short clips in one single composite movie. Performance is improved by not having to load and unload discrete movies all the time: QuickTime is sur- prisingly adept at jumping around even within quite large movies. Produc- tion is also more efﬁcient by avoiding the necessity to process large numbers of individual movies.  Movie Playback Settings The QTMovie object has a number of properties that provide control over var- ious  aspects  of  movie  playback.  Say  your  movie  comprises  a  collection  of advertising  clips:  you  probably  want  the  movie  to  begin  playing  automati- cally when someone opens it, and you will also no doubt want to bore them to tears by looping the movie to play over and over again:  myMovie.AutoPlay = True myMovie.Loop = True  Whenever AutoPlay is True, the movie will begin to play as soon as it is opened. This is really just a convenience property as you could easily call the  70 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   Play method to do the same thing once the movie is loaded. If Loop is True, as soon as the movie reaches the end, it will jump back to the beginning and start playing again.  If you sneakily embed subliminal messages in your advertising clips that only make sense when played backwards, then you might well opt for the LoopIsPalindrome property. If LoopIsPalindrome is set to True, as soon as the movie reaches the end, it will start to play in reverse towards the beginning again; and once it reaches the beginning, it plays forward again, constantly shuttling  backwards  and  forwards.  Palindrome  looping  can  sometimes  be useful for movies that contain animation sequences.  Both  the  Loop  and  LoopIsPalindrome  properties  also  apply  whenever  a selection exists, except that in this case the speciﬁed behavior applies to the selection only. A children’s game may involve short, repeated sequences of animated  action—say,  a  character  running  away  or  falling  through  the  air. Many  such  sequences  can  be  included  in  the  same  movie;  playing  a sequence involves code something like the following:  Const kMonsterRunningStart = 4570 Const kMonsterRunningDuration = 3500  myMovie.PlaySelectionOnly = True myMovie.Loop = True myMovie.SetSelection kMonsterRunningStart, kMonsterRunningDuration   myMovie.Time = kMonsterRunningStart myMovie.Play    'Run away from the monster  AutoPlay, Loop, and LoopIsPalindrome are all persistent properties of the movie. This means that the state of these properties can be saved with the movie. So, for example, if we were to load a movie, set AutoPlay to True, and then  call  the  movie’s Save  method,  the  next  time  the  movie  is  opened,  its AutoPlay property will already be True and it should start to play immedi- ately.  Both  QuickTime  Player  and  the  QuickTime  browser  plug-in  also respect these properties.  Tracks: QTTracks and QTTrack  If  you  have  worked  with  QuickTime  for  any  length  of  time,  you  soon become familiar with the concept of a track. In its most commonly under- stood form a track is usually a linear sequence of media samples, such as video frames or audio samples. A QuickTime movie is then comprised of one or more of these tracks or media sequences. So a very simple Charlie Chap- lin silent movie might contain only a single video track, while the trailer for  The QuickTime Object Model 71   Lord of the Rings is likely to contain two tracks: a video track and a separate audio  track.  As  the  movie  plays,  QuickTime  cleverly  combines  the  tracks and synchronizes them  Figure 4.4 .  Movies can, of course, have multiple tracks, as shown in Figure 4.5. The tracks  may  be  separated  both  spatially   in  different  locations  within  the movie’s bounding area  and temporally  over different time periods within the movie .  In  the  QuickTime  Object  Model  the  tracks  are  represented  as  child objects of the movie and are made available through the QTTracks collection of the movie.  The Tracks property of the movie returns the QTTracks collection. Access-  ing the individual tracks is then syntactically straightforward:  'Let's have some peace myMovie.Tracks.Item 3 .Mute = True  Notice that Tracks.Item n  returns the nth QTTrack object. Since this is a frequently used construct, some languages such as Visual Basic allow you to omit the Item property of the Tracks collection altogether:  'Let the music play myMovie.Tracks 3 .Mute = False  Video track  Sound track  Figure 4.4 Movie with a video track and a sound track.  In Depth Look up the QTTracks object in the Object Browser and you will notice that the Item prop- erty  is  deﬁned  as  the  default  member  of  the  QTTracks  collection:  if  you  leave  out  the name of the property, as in the preceding code, the default member is assumed.  Iterating over the Tracks As  with  any  collection,  we  will  often  want  to  retrieve  some  information about,  or  perhaps  do  something  to,  every  item  in  the  collection:  in  other words we want to iterate over the collection. For example, if we have a mixed bag of movies, it’s often instructive to iterate over the tracks collection of any movie  that  we  might  open,  so  that  we  can  extract  useful  data  about  each  72 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   Video track 1  Video track 2 : title overlay  Sound track 1 : musical score  Sound track 2 : voiceover  English   Sound track 3 : voiceover  Japanese   Figure 4.5 Movie with multiple tracks.  track.  There  are  two  ways  that  we  can  do  this;  the  ﬁrst  makes  use  of  the Count property, which every collection must have:  For i = 1 To myMovie.Tracks.Count        t += "Track : " + CStr i  + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "Type     : " + Hex myMovie.Tracks i .Type  + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "Format   : " + myMovie.Tracks i .Format + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "Duration : " + CStr myMovie.Tracks i .Duration                                   + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "StartTime: " + CStr myMovie.Tracks i .StartTime                                   + vbCrLf  Next i txtResults = t  Next trk txtResults = t  Alternatively, at least in Visual Basic, we can use the For Each construct  for improved readability:  Dim trk As QTTrack For Each trk In myMovie.Tracks        t += "Track : " + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "Type     : " + Hex trk.Type  + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "Format   : " + trk.Format + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "Duration : " + CStr trk.Duration  + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "StartTime: " + CStr trk.StartTime  + vbCrLf  The QuickTime Object Model 73   Having gotten our hands on a QTTrack object from the tracks collection of  our movie, let’s see what we can do with it.  Enabling and Disabling a Track Imagine  a  training  movie  with  instructional  audio  tracks  in  different  lan- guages, say, one in English, one in French, and one in Japanese. For obvious reasons, we only want one of these tracks to play at a time, so we use the Enabled property of the track to turn off all of the tracks except the one that we want to hear:  'Voiceover in English myMovie.Tracks 2 .Enabled = True myMovie.Tracks 3 .Enabled = False myMovie.Tracks 4 .Enabled = False  'Voiceover in French myMovie.Tracks 2 .Enabled = False myMovie.Tracks 3 .Enabled = True myMovie.Tracks 4 .Enabled = False  'Voiceover in Japanese myMovie.Tracks 2 .Enabled = False myMovie.Tracks 3 .Enabled = False myMovie.Tracks 4 .Enabled = True  A text track is often used to subtitle a movie: again we can easily toggle the subtitles on or off.   Positioning a Track The  QTTrack  object  also  has  a  full  suite  of  properties  that  allow  you  to dynamically position the track relative to the movie. This can be really use- ful  in  some  applications.  Taking  an  educational  example,  our  application might have a collection of video clips of various natural habitats. Overlaid as a  second  track  on  each  clip  is  an  expert  “talking  head”  who  explains  the interesting features of each habitat. As well as simply enabling or disabling the talking head, we could allow control of both the position and size of the talking head overlay.  74 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   Meet the FourCharCode  In the earlier code snippets that iterate over the tracks, rather than just con- verting the numeric Type property to a string, we used the Hex function to convert  it  to  a  string  representing  a  hexadecimal  number.  The  result  still looks rather meaningless but you might notice a pattern: all video tracks will share the same Type value, as will all sound tracks. Here’s the output from a movie with an H.263 video track and an IMA 4:1 sound track:  Track :    Type     : 76696465   Format   : H.263   Duration : 34505   StartTime: 0 Track :    Type     : 736F756E   Format   : IMA 4:1   Duration : 34501   StartTime: 0  Notice that the Type of any track is an 8-digit hex number that can be split into four 2-digit single-byte values. It so happens that each of these bytes is the ASCII hex code for a speciﬁc character:    Video Track Type = 76696465 = 76 69 64 65 = v i d e = vide    Sound Track Type = 736F756E = 73 6F 75 6E = s o u n = soun  So what appears initially to be a meaningless 32-bit numeric code turns out in fact to be a four-character sequence that represents the type of the track: a video track is of type vide and a sound track is of type soun. This is the four- character code or FourCharCode data type that you will encounter quite fre- quently when developing with QuickTime.  To  facilitate  working  with  FourCharCode  values,  the  QTUtils  object includes two handy functions that convert between numeric FourCharCode values and their string representations: FourCharCodeToString and StringTo- FourCharCode. To use these utilities, all we need is an instance of the QTUtils object:  The QuickTime Object Model 75   Dim trk As QTTrack Dim qtu As New QTUtils For Each trk In myMovie.Tracks   t += "Track : " + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "Type   : " + qtu.FourCharCodeToString trk.Type                                 + vbCrLf   t += vbTab + "Format : " + trk.Format + vbCrLf Next trk txtResults = t  to produce an output like  Track :    Type     : vide   Format   : H.263 Track :    Type     : soun   Format   : IMA 4:1  In most cases the FourCharCode values that we need to use are all conve- niently  deﬁned  in  enumerations  in  the  QuickTime  COM  Control  and Library.  Occasionally,  though,  we  will  want  to  deﬁne  our  own  FourChar- Code values or to generate them automatically in some way. In such cases the  starting  point  is  a  four-character  string  that  can  be  converted  to  a FourCharCode  using  the  StringToFourCharCode  function  of  QTUtils  as  fol- lows:  Dim trk As QTTrack  Dim qtu As New QTUtils Dim soundTrackType As Long  soundTrackType = qtu.StringToFourCharCode "soun"   For Each trk In myMovie.Tracks   If trk.Type = soundTrackType then     t += vbTab + "Sound format   : " + trk.Format + vbCrLf   End If Next trk txtResults = t  Notice  that  the  FourCharCode  that  we  create  is  simply  stored  in  a  Long: that’s  important  to  understand.  There’s  nothing  mysterious  about  a  76 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   FourCharCode—it’s just a 32-bit unsigned integer whose 4 constituent bytes each represent a character.  Streams: QTStreams and QTStream  Advanced   If you are playing a movie that is being streamed from a server, then instead of having separate tracks for audio and video, the movie will contain only a single  streaming  track  of  type  strm.  This  streaming  track  contains  one  or more  media  streams  from  the  server  of  different  types:  video,  audio,  text, and so on  Figure 4.6.   The  QTTrack  object  has  a  child  QTStreams  collection  accessible  via  the Streams property of the track. Again, as with tracks, we can iterate through the streams and dump useful information about them:  For i = 1 To myTrack.Streams.Count   t += "Stream " + CStr i  + vbCrLf   t += " Type : " + qtu.FourCharCodeToString myTrack.                        Streams i .Type  + vbCrLf   t += " Format : " + myTrack.Streams i .Format + vbCrLf Next i txtResults = t  For a typical streaming movie with video and audio, this might produce  an output like  Stream 1   Type : vide   Format : MPEG4 Video Stream 2   Type : soun   Format : AAC  Server  Client movie  Streaming track type = strm  Stream  audio   Stream  video   Figure 4.6 Streaming Movie with audio and video streams.   The QuickTime Object Model 77   Of course, before attempting to iterate the streams of a track, it is impor- tant to establish that we have in fact got a streaming track; otherwise, we will just get an error when we attempt to access the Streams property of the track.  First  of  all,  we  should  use  the  HasCharacteristic  property  of  the movie  to  check  that  the  movie  is  indeed  a  streaming  movie,  and  then  we should  check  the  Type  of  the  track  itself.  So  a  more  robust  version  of  the streams iteration would be  If myMovie.HasCharacteristic qtMovieCharacteristicIsStreaming  Then   ...          If myTrack.Type = qtu.StringToFourCharCode "strm"  Then     For i = 1 To myTrack.Streams.Count       ...            Next i     txtResults = t   End If End If  As  anyone  who  has  ever  watched  much  streaming  video  will  be  aware, the  reality  is  often  disappointing  because  bandwidth  limitations,  poor  net- work connections, and server overload all take their toll. While the video we are watching might, in theory, be 25 frames per second, it may in fact drop so many frames that the end result is closer to 15 or 16 frames per second. QuickTime’s streaming media handlers keep track of this kind of statistic as the movie is playing and, if we are concerned about measuring or logging performance, we can get at this useful information for any stream through several properties of the QTStream object. The difference between Average- FrameRate and ExpectedFrameRate tells us something about the video quality, while  the  underlying  data  stream  performance  is  revealed  by  the  various Chunks and Queue properties.  QuickTime VR Nodes and Hotspots: QTVRNodes, QTVRNode,  QTHotspots, and QTHotspot  Most QuickTime movies comprise linear sequences of media samples that play one after the other in a sequence. These are known as linear movies and include sounds, video clips, and animation sequences. QuickTime can how- ever  handle  other  types  of  media  such  as  VR  panoramic  scenes  and three-dimensional  3D  objects, or interactive  wired  movies. In QuickTime jargon these are referred to as nonlinear movies—movies that don’t have a timeline.  78 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   When dealing with a QuickTime VR movie, the word movie appears some- what of a misnomer, as we are really talking about a 3D space that may be explored interactively. Technically, however, this VR experience is packaged up for us in the form of a QuickTime movie, complete with its own special- ized tracks and a custom movie controller.  While  a  VR  movie  does  contain  tracks,  and  these  tracks  do  contain  all data about the environment we are exploring, they are of limited interest. Of far greater interest are the other conceptual entities such as the 3D scenes that make up the VR environment and the hotspots that can be used to link from one scene to the next or to carry out custom actions.  Nodes: QTVRNodes and QTVRNode Each scene in a VR movie can be explored from a single viewpoint in space known as a node. A VR movie may have a collection of one or more nodes and so, in our QuickTime Object Model, a movie has a child QTVRNodes col- lection obtained through the VRNodes property of the movie. Clearly, only a VR movie will possess a QTVRNodes collection and so it makes sense to check this using the IsVRMovie property before we attempt to access the nodes col- lection:  If myMovie.IsVRMovie Then   nodeCount = myMovie.VRNodes.Count End If  The special QuickTime VR movie controller has interactive controls that allow you to explore the virtual environment, with a cameralike ability to pan and tilt around the scene or zoom in and out to points of interest. The QTMovie object  not the QTVRNode object  has a number of properties dedicated to con- trolling navigation around VR scenes, as summarized in Table 4.1.  Table 4.1  QTMovie Properties for VR Navigation  Property  Function in Current VR Node  Value  Min Value  Max Value  PanAngle TiltAngle FieldOfView PanTiltSpeed 1  slowest   PanAngleMin Pan angle  side-to-side   degrees  TiltAngleMin Tilt angle  up down   degrees  FieldOfViewMin FieldOfViewMax Zoom angle  in out   degrees   PanAngleMax TiltAngleMax  10  fastest   ZoomRate  1  slowest   10  fastest   Relative speed of panning and tilting default is 5. Relative speed of zooming in and out default is 5.  The QuickTime Object Model 79   The following code iterates over all the nodes in a VR movie and prints out the values of the angular properties listed in Table 4.1. Notice the use of the movie’s CurrentNodeID property to jump to a particular node under pro- gram control:  'Iterate over VR Nodes and Angles  Dim node As QTVRNode Dim t As String Const kFMT = "0.˚"  With myMovie    For Each node In .VRNodes      .CurrentNodeID = node.UniqueID      t += "VR Node : " + CStr node.UniqueID  + vbCrLf     t += "  Pan Angle range : " + Format .PanAngleMin, kFMT  + " to "     t += Format .PanAngleMax, kFMT  + vbCrLf     t += "  Pan Angle : " + Format .PanAngle, kFMT  + vbCrLf     t += "  Tilt Angle range : " + Format .TiltAngleMin, kFMT  + " to "     t += Format .TiltAngleMax, kFMT  + vbCrLf     t += "  Tilt Angle : " + Format .TiltAngle, kFMT  + vbCrLf     t += "  FOV range : " + Format .FieldOfViewMin, kFMT  + " to "     t += Format .FieldOfViewMax, kFMT  + vbCrLf     t += "  FOV : " + Format .FieldOfView, kFMT  + vbCrLf    Next node  End With  tbResults.Text = t  Not only can you read these properties, setting them can place the entire navigational experience under program control. You may wish to jump to a speciﬁc viewpoint:  80 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   With myMovie    .PanAngle = 125.0;   .TiltAngle = 0.0;   .FieldOfView = 40;  End With  There  is  no  reason  why  your  application  couldn’t  store  a  whole  set  of these viewpoints and jump around between them—perhaps as part of game play.   Hotspots: QTHotspots and QTHotspot A VR node may contain a number of hotspots. These can link to other nodes  for instance, a hotspot on a doorway , open a URL, or request some kind of application-speciﬁc  action.  In  the  QuickTime  Object  Model,  the  hotspots within  a  node  are  available  as  a  QTHotspots  collection  from  the  Hotspots property of the node. So to fully explore a VR movie, we use a nested itera- tion, ﬁrst over the nodes and then over the hotspots within each node:  'Iterate over VR Nodes and Hotspots  Dim node As QTVRNode Dim hs As QTHotspot Dim qtu As New QTUtils Dim t As String  For Each node In myMovie.VRNodes    t += "VR Node : " + CStr node.UniqueID  + vbTab   t += qtu.FourCharCodeToString node.Type  + vbCrLf    For Each hs In node.Hotspots      t += vbTab + "HS : " + CStr hs.UniqueID  + vbTab     t += qtu.FourCharCodeToString hs.Type  + vbCrLf    Next hs  Next node tbResults.Text = t  The QuickTime Object Model 81   We use this to give us a concise dump of the structure of a multinode VR movie:  VR Node : 127      pano   HS : 180         link VR Node : 128      pano   HS : 81          link   HS : 100         url VR Node : 129      pano   HS : 16          link  We can see that this VR movie contains three nodes each with a link hotspot that presumably links to another node, and one node with a url hotspot.2  Chapters: QTChapters  QuickTime provides a useful index facility for creating an index to the sec- tions or chapters within a movie. This comes into its own if you have a very long  movie.  Take,  for  example,  a  movie  of  a  dramatic  production  such  as Shakespeare’s  Macbeth.  You  could  have  a  chapter  for  each  act  and  scene, providing a means to rapidly navigate the entire movie.  Adding chapters to a movie is a somewhat tedious process in QuickTime Player, involving the pasting of a carefully crafted text ﬁle into a movie to create a special text track known as a chapter track. More detail on this topic is available at  www.apple.com quicktime tutorials chaptertracks.html  Once  created,  however,  getting  at  the  chapters  using  the  QuickTime Object  Model  couldn’t  be  simpler  using  the  QTChapters  collection  of  the movie.  Here’s  a  code  snippet  that  iterates  over  the  chapters  in  a  movie  and  dumps the name and start time for each chapter:3  Dim myMovie As QTMovie = AxQTControl1.Movie If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub  Dim chptr As QTChapter Dim t As String  2 Try these code samples  at the website  with Media Movies VR GolfCourse.mov.  3 Try this with Media Movies Chapters.mov.  82 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   For Each chptr In myMovie.Chapters   t += "Chapter " + CStr chptr.Number  + " : "   t += CStr chptr.StartTime  + " "   t += CStr chptr.Name  + " " + vbCrLf Next chptr tbResults.Text = t  There isn’t a whole lot that you can do with the QTChapter object other than extract some data about it as shown in the code. However, QTMovie has a GoToChapter method that will jump to any indexed chapter in the movie:  AxQTControl1.Movie.GoToChapter 4   QTQuickTime and Its Offspring  In addition to the QTMovie child object, which, as we have seen allows us to delve deep into the movie itself, the QuickTime Control has another child object that exposes lots of useful information and features—but this time of QuickTime itself—QTQuickTime.  QTQuickTime  In  the  same  way  as  we  request  the  QTMovie  object  through  the  control’s Movie  property,  the  QTQuickTime  object  is  available  through  the  QuickTime property of the control:  Dim qt as QTQuickTime qt = AxQTControl1.QuickTime  QuickTime Version In our QuickTime-based applications, it is frequently useful to know the ver- sion of QuickTime that we are running on. We may simply wish to display this in an About box, or we may wish to alert the user that a later version of QuickTime is required. Here’s how to display the version of QuickTime:  Dim ver As Long ver = AxQTControl1.QuickTime.Version MsgBox "QuickTime Version : " + CStr ver    The QuickTime Object Model 83   The result is somewhat disconcerting—not quite what we expected:  The  explanation  is  that  QuickTime.Version  returns  the  version  as  a  long integer, but in a particular format known as a binary-coded decimal, or BCD, version. Fortunately, we are spared the gory details of how to convert this to something meaningful as Apple has thoughtfully provided us with a Version- AsString property:  Dim ver As String ver = AxQTControl1.QuickTime.VersionAsString MsgBox "QuickTime Version : " + ver   This time things look much more meaningful:  In Depth: BCD Version  The BCD version is a 32-bit integer split into 4 byte ﬁelds and designed to squeeze in far more information than is really good for it, as follows:  Byte 1 Major revision Byte 2 Minor and bug revision Byte 3  Stage   2 BCD digits 1 BCD digit each develop, alpha, beta, or ﬁnal stage unsigned integer  Range 00–99 Range 0.0–9.9 HEX 20, 40, 60 or 80  Byte 4  Nonreleased version  Range 0–255  84 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   Version numbers like 7.0.2b101 can be packed into a single long value. Before dismiss- ing the BCD version format as confusingly archaic, it should be pointed out that it does have one redeeming feature: when comparing versions using BCD values, later versions will always have a numerically greater value than older versions of the same stage. This is a much  more  robust  means  of  comparing  versions  than  just  doing  a  string  comparison between, say, "6.0.2" and "7.1".  QuickTime Settings: QTSettings  System-wide  QuickTime  settings  may  be  adjusted  through  the  QuickTime Control  Panel   QuickTime  Preferences .  The  QTQuickTime  object  provides programmatic  access  to  a  number  of  these  settings  through  its QTSettings child  object,  which  can  be  obtained  from  the  Settings  property.  Most  of these settings you should never need to go near, at least in your application, but one or two can be useful.  Language It is possible to check or even change the QuickTime language setting:  Dim qt As QTQuickTime qt = AxQTControl1.QuickTime MsgBox "QuickTime Language : " + CStr qt.Settings.Language    The value returned is a standard localization code as deﬁned in  http:  developer.apple.com documentation QuickTime APIREF  LocalizationCodes.htm  Media Keys Certain codecs, such as Indeo and Sorenson, allow movies to be secured by a media key—effectively an unlock code—that is attached to the movie at the time  it  is  compressed.  A  matching  media  key  must  be  available  to  Quick- Time if the movie is to be playable. Media keys may be permanently added to QuickTime using the Control Panel, or they may be added and removed at runtime using the QTSettings object. Each media key has a name, usually determined by the codec, and an associated value.  Try playing a movie4 that is locked with a media key  “Indeo video4”  with a value of “1234”: you will see only blank frames. Now run the following, and then play the movie again:  4 Try loading the following movie: Media Movies RTD_Indeo_Key=1234.mov.  The QuickTime Object Model 85   Dim qt As QTQuickTime qt = AxQTControl1.QuickTime  qt.Settings.MediaKey "IndeoVideo4"  = "1234"  We have used a media key to unlock this movie. If you don’t wish to add the  media  key  permanently  to  QuickTime,  you  should  remove  it  when you’re done with it:  qt.Settings.DeleteMediaKey "IndeoVideo4"   Exporters: QTExporters and QTExporter  By far and away the most useful feature available through the QTQuickTime object is QuickTime’s unrivalled export facility. Not only is QuickTime capa- ble of opening a wide variety of media ﬁle formats, it can also export to a sur- prising number of formats as well. So, for example, we can open an AVI ﬁle with an Indeo video track and IMA 4:1 compressed sound track and export this as a 3GP video ﬁle with an AAC compressed sound track. Or, we can paste images frame by frame into an empty movie and then export our new composite  movie  using  any  of  the  standard  codecs  such  as  Sorenson.  For anyone involved in digital media production and delivery, this export facility in itself has to be one of the compelling reasons for using QuickTime.  The QTQuickTime object has a QTExporters collection comprised of QTEx- porter objects. We access the collection of exporters through the Exporters property of QTQuickTime. A QTExporter is a QuickTime object that can per- form an export function on a movie or even on an individual track within the movie, as shown in Figure 4.7. If you are familiar with the QuickTime API, the QTExporter is really a wrapper around one of the QuickTime exporter components.  Initially, the QTExporters collection is empty. The ﬁrst thing we have to do before  we  can  use  an  exporter  is  to  add  one  to  the  collection  and  then retrieve the QTExporter object as follows:  Dim qt As QTQuickTime Dim exp As QTExporter  qt = AxQTControl1.QuickTime qt.Exporters.Add   exp = qt.Exporters 1   86 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   QTTrack  QTExporter  QTMovie  AVI exporter  QuickTime Movie exporter  3G exporter  MPEG4 exporter  etc....  Exported file:  .mov .avi .wav .3gp etc.  Available QuickTime exporter components  Figure 4.7 The QTExporter object can export a movie or a track.  Once we have an exporter, we can proceed to conﬁgure it to export which- ever movie or track happens to be of interest. We do this by calling the Set- DataSource method of QTExporter, passing the track or movie that we wish to export:  exp.SetDataSource  AxQTControl1.Movie   exp.SetDataSource  AxQTControl1.Movie.Tracks 2    So we now have an exporter and we have given it a track or movie that we would like to export. At this point you might reasonably ask why we have to go to all this trouble. Why don’t the QTMovie and QTTrack objects simply have an Export method in the same way that QTMovie has a Save method? Well, the reason is mainly to do with efﬁciency. Once you have created and conﬁg- ured  an  exporter,  which  can  be  time  consuming,  especially  if  you  have  to  The QuickTime Object Model 87   allow its settings to be changed through the user interface, you can then use it over and over again with multiple movies or tracks.  Two further essentials are required before we can perform an export:  1  we  must  conﬁgure  the  exporter  settings  with  the  required  ﬁle  format, codecs, and settings that we wish to use; and  2  we must supply a ﬁle name and path for the exported ﬁle.  Export with Export Dialog All of this can be accomplished in one go by presenting the user with a com- posite export ﬁle dialog using the ShowExportDialog method:  exp.ShowExportDialog    The Export drop-down list can be used to select the type of exporter that we wish to use and the Options… button provides conﬁguration settings for the selected format  Figure 4.8 .  Figure 4.8 QTExporter’s ShowExportDialog.  88 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   Once you have selected a ﬁle name and clicked Save, the export process will begin. Depending on the length of your movie and the compression set- tings selected, this export can take a signiﬁcant length of time. A progress dialog keeps you informed of what’s happening and you can of course abort the export by clicking the Stop button at any point  Figure 4.9 .  Adding a sophisticated export movie feature to Simple Player5 turns out to  be surprisingly straightforward:  Private Sub mnuExport_Click ...  Handles mnuExport.Click    Dim qt As QTQuickTime = AxQTControl1.QuickTime    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    qt = AxQTControl1.QuickTime    If qt.Exporters.Count = 0 Then qt.Exporters.Add      Dim exp As QTExporter = qt.Exporters 1    exp.SetDataSource AxQTControl1.Movie    exp.ShowExportDialog    End Sub  This proves to be yet another example of how much functionality can often be unlocked via a few apparently simple properties and methods of a Quick- Time  object.  Anyone  familiar  with  doing  something  similar  in  C++  using the QuickTime API will particularly appreciate this.  Figure 4.9 Export progress dialog.  5 See www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples SimplePlayer for this and subsequent code samples.  The QuickTime Object Model 89   Export with Export Settings Dialog In the preceding example, the user must ﬁrst choose the particular type  of exporter he wants to use from the Export drop-down list and then conﬁgure the export settings by clicking on the Options... button. In many cases we will already know the type of exporter that we wish to use  AVI, MPEG, Quick- Time  Movie,  etc.   and  this  can  instead  be  set  programmatically  using  the TypeName property of the QTExporter object.   exp.TypeName = "QuickTime Movie"  Once the exporter type has been set, we can call ShowSettingsDialog   exp.ShowSettingsDialog    which displays the export settings dialog for the particular type of exporter that we have chosen. The example in Figure 4.10 shows the settings for the QuickTime  Movie  exporter.  This  is  exactly  the  same  settings  dialog  as  we would get if we chose a particular exporter in the Export Dialog and clicked on the Options... button. Note that it may be quite different from exporter to exporter, as a comparison of Figures 4.10 and 4.11 will show.  Once the OK button is clicked, the QTExporter object is conﬁgured. All we have left to do is to supply a ﬁle name and path and initiate the export process:  exp.DestinationFileName = "D:\QuickTime\Movies\JustExported.mov" exp.BeginExport    Once an export process has begun, it is possible to cancel the process: you could of course click the Stop button on the export progress dialog or you can simply call the CancelExport method:  exp.CancelExport    Batch Export Once an exporter has been conﬁgured, either by exporting once with ShowEx- portDialog or by using ShowSettingsDialog, it can be reused as many times as you like with the same settings. Once conﬁgured, all you need do for each movie or track you want to export is  1. Use SetDataSource to set the data source of the exporter to the movie or  track.  90 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model   Figure 4.10 Export settings for QuickTime Movie exporter.   2. Set DestinationFileName to the path and ﬁle name for the exported ﬁle. 3. Call BeginExport.  Here is a useful function that takes a source folder of movies  sourcePath  and  exports  each  movie  in  it  to  a  destination  folder   destPath   using  the exporterType speciﬁed:  Private Sub BatchExport ByVal exporterType As String,                                ByVal sourcePath As String,                                ByVal destPath As String,                                ByVal destFileExtension As String     Dim srcFile As String   Dim dstFile As String   Dim log As String = ""  The QuickTime Object Model 91   Figure 4.11 Export settings for DV Stream exporter.

Since we may be processing thousands of ﬁles, we don’t really want one or two errors or a single corrupt ﬁle to abort further processing. So we protect the critical code with a Try…Catch excep- tion handler: if an exception occurs while opening a movie or exporting it, the COMException handler will trap the error, log it, and just move on to the next  ﬁle.  Note  that  we  are  catching  a  System.Runtime.InteropServices .COMException rather than a System.Exception. This allows us to extract the  The QuickTime Object Model 93   COM error code  HRESULT  resulting from the failed COM call, which will be a help in identifying the cause of the exception. See Chapter 6 for a more detailed treatment of exception handling.  Potential Exporters We’ve discovered that QuickTime allows us to export a movie or a track in a variety of different formats, but how can we ﬁnd out what export formats are available for a particular movie or track? The list of potential exporters will vary depending on what type of movie or track we are dealing with. For example, we can’t really expect to be able to export a video track to a sound format such as WAV or AIFF, or a sound-only movie as a sequence of PICT images. Also, since QuickTime exporters exist as components in the Quick- Time architecture, it is entirely possible that additional  perhaps third-party  exporters may, or may not, be installed.  This  is  where  the  PotentialExporters  property  of  QTMovie  and  QTTrack comes to the rescue. This property returns a list of all the available exporters that  could  potentially  be  used  to  export  that  particular  movie  or  track. Rather  than  just  returning  a  delimited  list  in  a  string, PotentialExporters returns  an  array  of  all  the  exporter  types  packaged  up  in  a CFObject.  But what is a CFObject, and how do we extract the relevant data from it in a use- ful way? We’ll ﬁnd out in the next chapter.  Summary  Most  of  the  key  objects  in  the  QuickTime  object  library  have  been  intro- duced in this chapter—some brieﬂy and others in more detail. We have seen how these objects link together to form the QuickTime Object Model. Once a movie has been opened in the QuickTime Control, we’ve discovered that the Movie and QuickTime properties of the control become the gateways to the  underlying  objects  in  the  hierarchy  via  the  QTMovie  and  QTQuickTime objects. By this stage you should be able to conﬁdently access and manipu- late  the  various  collections  of  objects  together  with  the  individual  objects themselves.  Now that we have established a solid foundation, the next chapter is all about squeezing more out of QuickTime objects. We cover a number of key topics and techniques relating these to real-world examples.  94 Chapter 4 The QuickTime Object Model                                5  5  Diving Deeper Essential Topics for Serious QuickTime Development  Introduction  Dipping below the surface in the last chapter, we explored the QuickTime Object  Model  together  with  its  principal  constituent  objects.  We  saw  how these  objects  can  be  accessed  through  the  QuickTime  COM  Control  and looked  at  examples  of  how  the  objects  can  be  used.  Diving  in  somewhat deeper, this chapter moves on to tackle a number of more advanced topics. Master these and you will be well equipped to develop fully featured and professional-grade  .NET  applications  using  the  QuickTime  COM  Control and associated library of QuickTime objects.  QuickTime Events  We can make considerable progress in the development of our QuickTime applications  just  by  setting  properties  and  calling  methods  of  the  various objects  in  the  QuickTime  Object  Model.  However,  modern  object-oriented applications more often than not employ an event-driven model: something happens—such as a mouse click—and we have an event handler to respond to  it.  A  QuickTime  application  is  no  different  except  that,  in  addition  to responding to user interface events, we can respond to events that are trig- gered by the QuickTime objects themselves. We touched on this brieﬂy in Chapter 2 when we looked at the   event of the QuickTime Con- trol, which is ﬁred whenever the control changes size.  SizeChanged  95                                                                                                                        Registering for QuickTime Events  As  it  turns  out,  there  are  so  many  events  that  the  QuickTime  objects  can potentially  notify  us  about  that  it  would  be  impractical,  not  to  mention grossly  inefﬁcient,  for  our  application  to  receive  and  handle  them  all willy-nilly. So in order to be notiﬁed of events by an instance of a QuickTime object we must ﬁrst specify the particular event s  we are interested in. We do  this  by  adding  those  events  about  which  we  want  to  be  notiﬁed  to  the EventListeners   collection  of  the  object.  Each  type  of  event  is  speciﬁed  by  as deﬁned by two enumera- two constants: the  . By adding an event of a par- tions:  ticular  class  and  ID  to  the    collection,  we  are  said  to  be  of that event. Here’s an example where we register to registering be notiﬁed when the play rate is about to change on a movie:  and the  event ID, QTEventIDsEnum  event class   and   QTEventClassesEnum  EventListeners  notiﬁed   to be   With AxQTControl1.Movie   .EventListeners.Add QTEventClassesEnum.qtEventClassStateChange,              QTEventIDsEnum.qtEventRateWillChange  End With    and   QTEventClassesEnum  Looking  through     in  the  Object Browser or in Table 5.2  page 102  will give you some idea of the variety of QuickTime events that you can register to be notiﬁed about. You will notice that the events are grouped into a number of functional classes. The event  are mostly self-explanatory, but note the constant names in  careful wording that subtly conveys the precise meaning of the event:  QTEventIDsEnum  QTEventIDsEnum  DidChange :  WillChange :  Request  :  Something has already happened and we are being notiﬁed after  the  fact.  The  implication  is  that  we  can  do  nothing about it. Something is just about to happen and we are being notiﬁed beforehand. It may be possible to cancel it. A  request  is  being  made  to  allow  something  to  happen.  It may be possible to alter the behavior or cancel it.

QTEvent   event from the  Before going any farther, let’s pause brieﬂy to clarify some potentially con- fusing terminology: it is important to distinguish between QuickTime events  as  listed  in  the    event  of  the   enumeration   and  the  QuickTime Control. The   event is the COM .NET event that acts as the gateway for the QuickTime events that we register to be notiﬁed of.   QTEventIDsEnum QTEvent  QTEvent  In Depth QTEvent  is a connection-point–based event interface supplied by the QuickTime Control for COM clients. The COM Interop layer cleverly maps this connection-point event to the .NET delegate-based event model.  In most cases, the client that handles, or sinks, the    events is usu- ally  but not always  the form that hosts the QuickTime Control, as shown in Figure 5.1. This is where we must add our code to handle any QuickTime events that we registered for.   QTEvent  Let’s look at what it takes to add a   QTEvent   handler to our Visual Basic or  C form.  Thankfully,  Visual  Studio  .NET  takes  the  drudgery  out  of  adding  event handlers by generating a skeleton handler for us. Here’s how we do this, ﬁrst in Visual Basic and then in C.

OnQTEvent  You will end up with a skeleton event handler like this:  private void OnQTEvent object sender,             AxQTOControlLib._IQTControlEvents_QTEventEvent e  {  }  This  time,  behind  the  scenes  in  the  Windows  Form  Designer–generated  to  code, you’ll also ﬁnd that this event handler has been added as a  the   QTEvent  delegate  :  this.axQTControl1.QTEvent += new             AxQTOControlLib._IQTControlEvents_QTEventEventHandler    this.OnQTEvent ;  Event Parameters  If you’re new to .NET events, you may ﬁnd the parameters of this event han- dler somewhat intimidating at ﬁrst glance, but they really are quite straight- forward:  QuickTime Events  99                                                                                                                 sender   : the .NET object that originated the event—in this case always the  e   : this object contains the event parameters as summarized in Table  QuickTime Control.  5.1.  In most nontrivial cases, we are likely to have to register for a number of  different QuickTime events, possibly even on different objects:  With AxQTControl1.Movie    .EventListeners.Add QTEventClassesEnum.qtEventClassStateChange,              QTEventIDsEnum.qtEventRateWillChange     .EventListeners.Add QTEventClassesEnum.qtEventClassTemporal,              QTEventIDsEnum.qtEventTimeWillChange     .EventListeners.Add QTEventClassesEnum.qtEventClassAudio,              QTEventIDsEnum.qtEventAudioVolumeDidChange     .Tracks 1 .EventListeners.Add QTEventClassesEnum.              qtEventClassAudio, QTEventIDsEnum.              qtEventAudioVolumeDidChange   End With  Notiﬁcations  of  all  these  events  end  up  in  our   QTEvent  e.eventID we can easily use a    returns the ID of the QuickTime event that raised this   Select Case   statement in Visual Basic, or a     handler.

For  example,  the  qtEventRateWillChange  always has a qtEventParamMovieRate parameter, while qtEventLinkToURLRequest has a  qtEventParamURL  parameter.  These  parameters  can  be  accessed  through e.eventObject, which returns an object of type QTEventObject. This object is packed  with  event-speciﬁc  data   Table  5.3   including  the  event  parameters that we have just mentioned.   To get a particular parameter, we use the GetParam method with the appro- priate  constant  from  QTEventObjectParametersEnum.  We  can  now  easily extend our event handler to display some of these parameters:  QuickTime Events 101   Event Class and Event ID  Objects  Description  Can Be  Canceled  Parameters  Table 5.2  QuickTime Events  qtEventClassAudio  qtEventAudioVolumeDidChange  qtEventAudioMuteDidChange  qtEventAudioBalanceDidChange  qtEventClassSpatial  qtEventSizeDidChange  QTMovie QTTrack QTMovie QTTrack QTMovie QTTrack  The audio volume of a movie or  track has changed.

QuickTime  Events Demo  is  a  simple  but  practical  code  sample  designed  to  demonstrate  the usefulness  of  QuickTime  events  in  a  real  application.  It  is  essentially  a very  basic  movie  composition  application  such  as  might  be  used  in  a newsroom to compile a 30-minute program from a series of shorter clips.   Looking at the application screenshot in Figure 5.2, the clips are loaded into  the  Source  QuickTime  Control  on  the  left   AxQTControl1   and  can  be appended to the movie in the Destination control on the right  AxQTControl2  using the >> button in the center. The X button allows you to undo the most recent change. Each QuickTime Control has two buttons underneath on the left-hand side: the ﬁrst is a Load button that brings up an Open Movie dialog, and the second is a combined Play Stop button. The Destination movie has a New button that will create a new empty movie as a starting point, and a Save… button so that you can save your ﬁnished composition. Finally, at the bottom of the window below the Destination movie is a display of its current  QuickTime Events 105   Figure 5.2 QuickTime Events Demo.  Length  and  Size.  Simple  enough  in  concept,  but  as  we  work  through  the implementation, we’ll discover useful ways to apply QuickTime events.  First we’ll set up the basic functionality. Good programming practice usu- ally dictates that when you work with multiple instances of any object, com- mon code should be shared. In this case we have two QuickTime Controls and two Load buttons and so we use a shared LoadMovie function, with the instance of the QuickTime Control passed as a parameter, along with an inte- ger index:  Private Sub LoadMovie ByVal qtCtrl As AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl,              ByVal idx As Long     Dim filter As String   filter = "Movies*.mov;*.mpg;*.avi;*.dv"   filter = filter + "Audio files*.wav;*.aif;*.mp3;*.m4a;*.m4p"   filter = filter + "All files  *.* *.*"   OpenFileDialog1.Filter = filter    qtCtrl.Sizing =              QTSizingModeEnum.qtMovieFitsControlMaintainAspectRatio    If OpenFileDialog1.ShowDialog   = DialogResult.OK Then             qtCtrl.URL = OpenFileDialog1.FileName     End If  106 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper     If qtCtrl.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    MovieSetup qtCtrl.Movie, idx   End Sub  what it says.  We’ll come to MovieSetup later—for now just assume that it does exactly  The Click handlers for the Load buttons are trivial:  Private Sub btnLoad1_Click ...  Handles btnLoad1.Click    LoadMovie AxQTControl1, 1   End Sub  Private Sub btnLoad2_Click ...  Handles btnLoad2.Click    LoadMovie AxQTControl2, 2   End Sub  Stop routine:  For the Play Stop buttons, again we factor common code out into a Play-  Private Sub PlayStop ByVal qtCtrl As AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl     If qtCtrl.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    If qtCtrl.Movie.Rate = 0 Then     qtCtrl.Movie.Play     Else     qtCtrl.Movie.Stop     End If  End Sub  Private Sub btnPS1_Click ...  Handles btnPS1.Click    PlayStop AxQTControl1   QuickTime Events 107   End Sub  End Sub  End Sub  End Sub  Private Sub btnPS2_Click ...  Handles btnPS2.Click    PlayStop AxQTControl2   Since we have a LoadMovie routine, it makes sense to have a similar New-  Movie routine for our New button:  Private Sub NewMovie ByVal qtCtrl As AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl,              ByVal idx As Long     qtCtrl.Sizing =              QTSizingModeEnum.qtMovieFitsControlMaintainAspectRatio   qtCtrl.CreateNewMovie      If qtCtrl.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    MovieSetup qtCtrl.Movie, idx   Private Sub btnNewMovie_Click ...  Handles btnNewMovie.Click    NewMovie AxQTControl2, 2   Continuing our basic functionality, we implement the Append  >>  and  Undo  X  buttons:  Private Sub btnAppend_Click ...  Handles btnAppend.Click    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub   If AxQTControl2.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    With AxQTControl1.Movie     If .SelectionDuration = 0 Then .SelectAll       .Copy     End With  108 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper     With AxQTControl2.Movie     .Time = .Duration     .Paste     End With  End Sub  Private Sub btnUndo_Click ...  Handles btnUndo.Click    If AxQTControl2.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    AxQTControl2.Movie.Undo    End Sub  In both cases, defensive programming dictates that we shouldn’t attempt to do anything if there is no movie loaded. When we come to append, the user  may  already  have  made  a  selection  in  the  Source  movie   using  the movie  controller ;  if  not,  we  select  the  entire  movie.  The  selection  is  then copied  to  the  clipboard.  Appending  the  clip  to  the  Destination  movie involves ﬁrst moving to the end of that movie before pasting the selection from the clipboard.  And  ﬁnally  of  course,  we  mustn’t  forget  the  Save  button,  without which everything we’ve done so far would be a little pointless; again for con- sistency we have a SaveMovie routine:  Private Sub SaveMovie ByVal qtCtrl As AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl     If qtCtrl.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    With qtCtrl.Movie     .SetSelection 0, 0      .Time = 0     If .CanUpdateMovieFile Then       .Save       Else       SaveFileDialog1.Title = "Save Movie As"       SaveFileDialog1.FileName = "Untitled.mov"       If SaveFileDialog1.ShowDialog   = DialogResult.OK Then         .SaveSelfContained SaveFileDialog1.FileName            btnSave.Enabled = False       End If  QuickTime Events 109       End If    End With  End Sub  SaveMovie has to be a little bit clever: it must do the right thing whether the Destination movie is a preexisting movie that we may have loaded, or a new movie. In the former case, the movie can just be saved to its current location, whereas for a new movie we must use a SaveFileDialog to prompt the user for a ﬁle name. SaveMovie checks the movie’s CanUpdateMovieFile property so that it can decide which course of action to take: if this property is True, then the movie has been opened from a ﬁle and can be saved back into that ﬁle. Notice, too, that in the case of a new movie, we use SaveSelf- Contained  rather  than  Save  so  that  our  newly  created  and  saved  movie  is fully self-contained with all its own data resources, rather than just contain- ing references to the bits of other movies that we’ve pasted into it.  If  we  build  and  run  our  sample  application  at  this  point,  we  should  be able to load a movie into either QuickTime Control and be able to play and stop  either  movie  independently  using  the  Play Stop  buttons.  It  should  be possible to create a new Destination movie, to append selections from the Source movie to it, and to save it.  So far so good, but what about QuickTime events you may ask with some  justiﬁcation? Well, now it’s time to add a little polish.  First let’s tackle those Play Stop buttons: while the graphical button may look  good,  it  really  doesn’t  properly  convey  its  dual  function  so  long  as  it remains  a  static  forward  arrow     cid:2  .  Ideally,  like  any  professional  media player, it should change to a standard square Stop icon   cid:3   while the movie is playing, and back to the arrow Play icon   cid:2   when the movie stops.   One perfectly valid way to do this would be to set up a timer on an inter- val of, say, 250 ms, which regularly polls the state of the movie—playing or stopped—and  sets  the  button  image  accordingly.  But  there’s  something rather unsatisfying about such an approach—it smacks a little too much of brute force.  A much more elegant—and efﬁcient—solution is to have the movie tell us when its play rate changes so that we can change the state of the button. To achieve this, we register for the QuickTime event qtEventRateWillChange to notify us any time the movie’s play rate changes for whatever reason.  Second,  a  common  requirement  of  good  UI  design  is  that  a  button  or menu  item  should  be  enabled  only  when  its  function  is  available.  This  110 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   applies to our Save… button: by rights it should remain disabled unless the Destination  movie  is  dirty   i.e.,  has  been  edited   and  needs  to  be  saved. Again, it turns out that we can use a QuickTime event to notify us whenever the movie has been changed: qtEventMovieWasEdited.  Registering for these QuickTime events just involves adding them to the movie’s  EventListeners  collection.  We  will  then  be  notiﬁed  any  time  the play rate changes and any time the movie is changed for any reason. We do this in MovieSetup  remember this is called by both LoadMovie and NewMovie :  Private Sub MovieSetup ByVal mov As QTMovie, ByVal idx As Long     If mov Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    With mov     .EventListeners.Add QTEventClassesEnum.qtEventClassStateChange,              QTEventIDsEnum.qtEventRateWillChange, 0, idx      .EventListeners.Add QTEventClassesEnum.qtEventClassStateChange,              QTEventIDsEnum.qtEventMovieWasEdited, 0, idx    End With    btnSave.Enabled = False   UpdateDestinationMovieStatus    End Sub  One small detail is important here: notice that the idx parameter that is passed  in  to  LoadMovie  or  NewMovie  gets  passed  on  as  the  Context   fourth parameter  when we register for the event. Glancing back at the Click event handlers for the Load buttons, you see that the value of idx will be either 1 or 2 depending on which QuickTime Control is being loaded.  Coming now to the event handler, the temptation is to add two QTEvent handlers—one  for  each  control.  And  why  ever  not?  Events  from  AxQT- Control1  will  be  handled  by  its  own QTEvent  handler,  and  those  from  the other QuickTime Control by a second dedicated QTEvent handler: no confu- sion, no risk, and anyway, who cares about the duplicate code? But there’s that nagging feeling again—there must be a better way.  There is of course, and it involves sharing a single QTEvent handler. The .NET event model allows you to delegate the event handling from any num- ber of objects to the same handler. In Visual Basic this simply involves tag- ging  another  item  onto  the  Handles  chain.  Here’s  our  skeleton  shared QTEvent handler:  QuickTime Events 111   Private Sub OnQTEvent ByVal sender As Object,              ByVal e As AxQTOControlLib._IQTControlEvents_QTEventEvent              Handles AxQTControl1.QTEvent, AxQTControl2.QTEvent End Sub  The syntax is self-explanatory: OnQTEvent handles AxQTControl1.QTEvent and AxQTControl2.QTEvent.  The complete QTEvent handler follows. Selecting e.eventID allows us to  handle each event type appropriately:  Private Sub OnQTEvent ByVal sender As Object,              ByVal e As AxQTOControlLib._IQTControlEvents_QTEventEvent              Handles AxQTControl1.QTEvent, AxQTControl2.QTEvent    Dim rate As Single   Dim btn As Button = Nothing    Select Case e.eventID      Case QTEventIDsEnum.qtEventRateWillChange        Select Case e.eventObject.Context         Case 1           btn = btnPS1         Case 2           btn = btnPS2       End Select        If btn Is Nothing Then Exit Sub        If rate = 0 Then         btn.ImageIndex = 0  'Play       Else         btn.ImageIndex = 1  'Stop       End If      Case QTEventIDsEnum.qtEventMovieWasEdited        rate = e.eventObject.GetParam              QTEventObjectParametersEnum.qtEventParamMovieRate   112 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper         If e.eventObject.Context = 2 Then         btnSave.Enabled = True         UpdateDestinationMovieStats         End If    End Select  End Sub  Dealing ﬁrst with qtEventRateWillChange, recall the Context value that we passed  in  when  registering  for  this  event:  this  can  now  be  retrieved  using e.eventObject.Context, used to determine which movie the event originated from, and therefore which Play Stop button  left or right  we should operate on. Once we know which button we’re working with, we extract the qtEvent- ParamMovieRate  parameter  that  was  passed  with  the qtEventRateWillChange event. The value of this, which indicates the current new play rate, can then be used to switch the ImageIndex of the button.  In handling qtEventMovieWasEdited, we’re only interested in events from the Destination movie since that’s the only movie that can be saved, so again we check the Context value before enabling the Save… button. The button is always disabled in MovieSetup. At this point, since the movie has changed, we also call UpdateDestinationMovieStats to refresh the statistics about the destination movie:  Private Sub UpdateDestinationMovieStats      Dim t As String   If AxQTControl2.Movie Is Nothing Then     LabelStatus.Text = ""   Else     t += "Length : " + CStr AxQTControl2.Movie.Duration      t += "  "     t += "Size : " + Format AxQTControl2.Movie.Size   1000, "0 kB"      LabelStatus.Text = t   End If  End Sub  Build and run the demo again now, and you should notice the icon on the Play Stop buttons changing on cue. This should work correctly irrespective  QuickTime Events 113   of  how  you  start  or  stop  the  movie:  clicking  the  Play Stop  button, double-clicking the movie, or using the movie controller. Click on the New button to create an empty movie and append a clip from the Source movie: the Save button should be enabled and the movie stats will be updated.  Deploying a couple of QuickTime events has allowed us to bring the user interface of this application up a step from crude functionality and closer to what would be expected in a professional application.  QuickTime Metadata  Whether it be a major sporting event, the latest blockbuster movie, or a song that we have just purchased, we are obsessed with information about what- ever it is we are watching or listening to: who was playing, who starred, who was the director, the artist, and so on. In fact, such information about some- thing can often be as important as the thing itself.   Take,  for  instance,  the  photograph  shown  in  Figure  5.3  of  an  oversize chick  staring  out  indignantly  from  its  mud-bowl  nest,  looking  for  all  the world like a ﬂuffy toy with its ludicrously big feet and bill. As an image it’s cute of course, but when we discover that this chick will one day become a full-grown  black-browed  albatross—a  master  of  ocean  ﬂight—with  a  wing- span  of  almost  8  feet   2.5  meters ,  the  picture  takes  on  a  whole  lot  more meaning. Our interest is further enhanced when we learn that this photo-  Title  Species  Albatross Chick on Nest  Black-browed albatross   Scientific name  Diomedea melanophris  Adult wingspan  Place  Location  2.5 meters  8 feet   Falkland Islands 51  22' S  60  4' W  Date   2 February 2004  Figure 5.3 Image with associated metadata.  114 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   graph was taken on a small island in the South Atlantic—one of the Falkland Islands—at latitude 51˚  22' S and longitude 60˚  4' W, in the antipodean sum- mer.  All of this information about a particular item of digital media is known  in information technology circles as metadata.  When  it  comes  to  digital  media,  metadata  is  usually  stored  under  a  set of  tags  such  as  Title,  Date,  Description,  and  the  like,  as  we  can  see  in Figure  5.3.  Some  tags,  such  as  Title,  will  be  common  to  a  wide  variety  of media  types,  while  others,  such  as  Album,  may  be  speciﬁc  to  a  particular type  of  media.  Various  efforts  have  been  made  to  develop  standards  for metadata  tags,  but  often  the  tags  associated  with  a  particular  media  col- lection are somewhat arbitrary.  With  the  burgeoning  popularity  of  digital  photography  and  personal music  collections,  many  of  us  are  amassing  sizeable  digital  media  collec- tions  running  to  thousands  and  even  tens  of  thousands  of  ﬁles.  Organiz- ing  these  personal  collections  has  become  the  new  chore,  with  the laborious  entering  of  metadata—such  as  captions  for  last  summer’s  holi- day  snaps—replacing  the  once  arduous  task  of  writing  on  the  back  of each  4"  x  6"  print  before  stufﬁng  it  into  an  album.  However,  the  end result,  delivered  to  your  relatives  on  a  shiny  CD-R,  is   not  surprisingly  just as boring!  So  metadata  is  fast  becoming  a  preoccupation  of  the  digital  classes, and  any  serious  digital  media  technology  had  better  be  able  to  handle metadata  convincingly.  Fortunately,  QuickTime  is  just  such  a  technol- ogy  and,  in  fact,  has  supported  the  concept  of  metadata  long  before  the advent of the personal digital media collection.   Not  only  does  QuickTime  support  its  own  metadata  format,  it  makes  a determined  effort  to  unify  access  to  the  metadata  standards  of  other  digi- tal  media  formats  that  it  supports.  So,  for  example,  using  the  same  API we  can  obtain  the  title  of  an  MP3  song,  the  caption  of  a  JPEG  digital photograph,  or  the  copyright  information  on  a  DV  video  clip.  This  layer of  abstraction  for  metadata  is  one  reason  why  QuickTime  is  so  often  the technology  of  choice  for  professional  applications  handling  diverse  media content.  Annotations   QuickTime can store and retrieve metadata items associated either with a movie itself or with any of the individual tracks in a movie. In the Quick- Time COM library metadata items are known as Annotations and may be  QuickTime Metadata 115   Table 5.4  Some of the Metadata Tags Available in QTAnnotationsEnum Metadata Tag  Annotation ID  FourCharCode  Album Artist Author Comments Composer Copyright Description Director Title   Name Genre Information Performers Producer Software Writer  qtAnnotationAlbum qtAnnotationArtist qtAnnotationAuthor qtAnnotationComments qtAnnotationComposer qtAnnotationCopyright qtAnnotationDescription qtAnnotationDirector qtAnnotationFullName qtAnnotationGenre qtAnnotationInformation qtAnnotationPerformers qtAnnotationProducer qtAnnotationSoftware qtAnnotationWriter  'albm' 'arts' 'auth' 'cmmt' 'comp' 'cprt' 'desc' 'dtor' 'name' 'genr' 'info' 'perf' 'prod' 'soft' 'wrtr'  accessed individually through the Annotation property of the QTMovie and QTTrack objects. Whenever we use the Annotation property, we must sup- ply an Annotation ID to indicate which particular annotation or metadata item we are referring to  Title, Description, Album, etc.  This Annotation ID  is  effectively  the  metadata  tag  and,  not  surprisingly,  it  is  a  FourChar- Code  see “Meet the FourCharCode” in Chapter 4 . For convenience, QTAn- notationsEnum contains a number of frequently used Annotation IDs, some of which are listed in Table 5.4.  Let’s retrieve and display some basic metadata from a movie:  Dim s As String If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub s = ""  With AxQTControl1.Movie   s += " Name   : " + .Annotation              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationFullName    s += vbCrLf   s += "Album  : " + .Annotation              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationAlbum   116 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper     s += vbCrLf   s += "Artist : " + .Annotation              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationArtist  End With  tbResults.Text = s  While  the  preceding  code  will  often  work  ﬁne,  if  we  have  the  temerity to  ask  for  an  annotation  that  doesn’t  exist,  the  QTMovie  object  is  very likely  to  deliver  us  a  wrap  across  the  knuckles  in  the  form  of  an  excep- tion.  Whether  this  actually  does  happen  depends,  of  course,  on  the  Error Handling mode of the QuickTime Control, but it’s as well to be prepared. The  safest  way  to  do  this  is  to  use  a  very  simple  GetAnnotation  function that just swallows any exceptions that might occur:  Function GetAnnotation ByRef mov As QTMovie,              ByVal annotationID As Long  As String    Dim val As String = ""    Try     val = mov.Annotation annotationID    Catch e As Exception     'Ignore error   End Try    GetAnnotation = val  End Function  A more robust way of getting movie metadata then becomes  Dim s As String If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub s = ""  With AxQTControl1   s += "Name  : " + GetAnnotation .Movie,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationFullName    s += vbCrLf   s += "Album : " + GetAnnotation .Movie,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationAlbum   QuickTime Metadata 117     s += vbCrLf   s += "Artist: " + GetAnnotation .Movie,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationArtist  End With  tbResults.Text = s  Hint  Experiment  with  the  preceding  code  snippet  on  any  iTunes  MPEG-4  audio  ﬁle   .m4a  or .m4p  in your music collection.  Setting the value of annotations is equally straightforward:  With AxQTControl1.Movie   .Annotation QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationArtist  =              "Ray Charles"   .Annotation QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationAlbum  =              "The Great Tomato Blues Package"   .Annotation QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationFullName  =              "Blues Is My Middle Name"   .Annotation QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationGenre  = "Blues" End Width  Once an annotation has been added or changed in this way, the movie is marked as having been changed. If you want to permanently save the anno- tation changes you have made, you must remember to save the movie using its Save method. Before calling Save, it’s usually good practice to check if the movie really does need to be saved:  If AxQTControl1.Movie.HasChanged Then AxQTControl1.Movie.Save    I mentioned earlier that the QTTrack object also has an Annotation prop- erty and that it is equally possible to store retrieve metadata to from individ- ual  tracks  in  a  movie.  Access  to  metadata  at  the  track  level  may  not immediately appear to be a particularly useful feature, but there are cases when  the  ability  to  store  data  with  the  individual  tracks  that  make  up  a movie can be valuable. Take, for instance, a news program that has been cre- ated by combining a number of shorter clips  as is very common in video editing  by putting each clip into a separate video track. QuickTime will of course combine the video tracks at playback time into what appears to be a single video track; however, the metadata for each clip  its title, source, etc.   118 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   is retained and accessible in the track metadata. Here’s an example that enu- merates the name and source of each track in a movie:  Dim s As String Dim i As Long Dim trk As QTTrack s = ""  With AxQTControl1.Movie   For i = 1 To .Tracks.Count     trk = .Tracks i      s += "Track " + CStr i  + vbCrLf     s += "  Name  : " + trk.Annotation              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationFullName      s += vbCrLf     s += "  Source: " + trk.Annotation              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationOriginalSource      s += vbCrLf   Next i End With  Custom Annotations  QuickTime provides a rich set of standard annotations in the form of QTAn- notationsEnum  and,  more  often  than  not,  these  will  serve  our  application needs perfectly. So, for example, if we want to store copyright information, we  have  qtAnnotationCopyright  speciﬁcally  for  that  purpose.  However, there are sometimes situations where we would like to store proprietary data in the movies that our application deals with. Perhaps there are particular application  settings  that  we  use  with  each  movie,  or  we  have  proprietary metadata in a particular format such as XML. In cases like these, it makes sense to use a custom annotation; this involves devising a new annotation ID, which shouldn’t of course clash with any of the standard IDs, and using it with the Annotation property.   As an example, an aerospace manufacturer might wish to manage a collec- tion of video clips of aircraft cabin interiors. While the name of the aircraft could easily be stored in the FullName annotation, the manufacturer’s cabin speciﬁcation  needs  to  be  stored  separately;  of  course,  one  of  the  standard  QuickTime Metadata 119   annotations could be appropriated for the purpose, but a custom annotation may be a more rigorous solution:  Dim qtu As New QTUtils Dim cabinSpecificationID As Long  cabinSpecificationID = qtu.StringToFourCharCode "CABN"   With AxQTControl1.Movie   .Annotation QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationFullName  =             "Airbus A340-300"   .Annotation cabinSpecificationID  = "Deluxe leather with fur trim" End Width  Tip Notice  that  our  custom  annotation  ID   "CABN"   is  in  uppercase,  the  reason  being  that Apple reserves all lowercase FourCharCode IDs. If you want to ensure that your annotation ID will never clash with one of Apple’s, make sure it’s in uppercase.  Many content management systems now store metadata in an XML for- mat, perhaps using a standard such as RDF  Resource Description Frame- work; see www.w3.org RDF for more detail . Again, it makes sense to use a custom annotation to store the entire chunk of XML metadata with each movie. While annotations are more often than not short text strings, there is  no  reason  why  much  larger  chunks  of  data  shouldn’t  be  stored  in  an annotation.  Metadata in MPEG Files  As well as providing access to its own proprietary metadata storage as we’ve just seen, QuickTime also attempts to provide access to metadata stored in some common media ﬁle formats, including MPEG.  ID3  tags  are  special  sections  within  an  MP3  ﬁle  in  which  information about the artist, album, title, and the like are stored. When QuickTime opens an MP3 ﬁle, the MP3 movie importer recognizes certain ID3 tags and maps them to movie annotations, as shown in Table 5.5. Unfortunately, only a lim- ited selection of ID3 tags appears to be accessible through QuickTime.  iTunes stores songs in .m4a and .m4p ﬁles using the MPEG-4 AAC stan- dard. Metadata in these ﬁles is stored not in ID3 tags but in AAC tags. Again, QuickTime  takes  care  of  this,  providing  access  to  many  of  these  tags,  as shown in Table 5.6.  120 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   Table 5.5  Annotation IDs for Some Common ID3 Tags ID3 tag  Annotation ID   FourCharCode  Album Artist Band orchestra Comment Composer Copyright Title name Track number Year date of recording  qtAnnotationAlbum qtAnnotationArtist qtAnnotationPerformers qtAnnotationComment qtAnnotationComposer qtAnnotationCopyright qtAnnotationFullName ' trk' ' day'  Table 5.6  Annotation IDs for Some Common AAC Tags AAC tag  Annotation ID   FourCharCode  Album Artist Comment Composer Name Grouping Encoder software  iTunes version  Year date of recording Apple ID  of purchaser from iTunes Music Store   qtAnnotationAlbum qtAnnotationArtist qtAnnotationComment qtAnnotationAuthor qtAnnotationFullName ' grp' ' too' ' day' 'apID'  Getting All the Annotations  As we’ve just seen, the Annotation property is invaluable in getting and set- ting individual annotations, but it’s not a lot of use if we want to obtain a complete list of all the annotations in a movie or track. This is where the read-only Annotations  plural  property comes in handy: it returns a dictio- nary of all the annotations and their values keyed on the annotation  tag  IDs. This  annotations  dictionary  comes  packaged  in  a  special  data  container object known as a CFObject. But before we can delve into its contents, we will have to learn a bit more about what a CFObject is.  QuickTime Metadata 121   CFObject and Its Uses  The CFObject is a data container object that is used throughout the Quick- Time Object Model, especially for complex data sets. It can contain data in a variety of formats from primitive types such as simple numbers or strings to more  complex  structures  such  as  an  array  or  dictionary,  or  even  just  raw bytes. Table 5.7 provides a summary.   If you have a CFObject, you can ﬁnd out what type it is  or, more precisely, what  type  of  data  it  contains   by  examining  its  Type  property.  This  will return one of the types listed in CFObjectTypesEnum, as shown in Table 5.7.  Table 5.7  The CFObject Data Types as Listed in CFObjectTypesEnum CFObject Type  Contains  CFObjectTypeBoolean CFObjectTypeNumber CFObjectTypeString CFObjectTypeArray CFObjectTypeDictionary  CFObjectTypeData CFObjectTypeInvalid  True or False Integer or floating-point number String Array of CFObject Dictionary of key-value pairs. Key may be integer or string.  Value may be any CFObject. Raw data  i.e., bytes  Nothing  If  the  CFObject  is  a  Boolean,  Number,  or  String,  you  can  get  its  value using the   default   Value  property,  which  simply  returns  the  value  as  a System.Object in .NET or Variant in VB6.   The CFObject is not just a read-only object. It is also possible to create a CFObject and put data into it. The following code snippet shows how to cre- ate a CFObject and use it with the primitive CFObject types:  Dim cf As New CFObject Dim s As String  cf.Value = "Grasshopper"    'String s += "Value : " + cf.Value + vbCrLf s += "Type : " + CStr cf.Type  + vbCrLf  cf.Value = 123              'Integer s += "Value : " + CStr cf.Value  + vbCrLf s += "Type : " + CStr cf.Type  + vbCrLf  122 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   cf.Value = 1234.5678        'Floating point s += "Value : " + CStr cf.Value  + vbCrLf s += "Type : " + CStr cf.Type  + vbCrLf  cf.Value = True             'Boolean s += "Value : " + CStr cf.Value  + vbCrLf s += "Type : " + CStr cf.Type  + vbCrLf  tbResults.Text = s  This produces the following output:  Value : Grasshopper Type : 2 Value : 123 Type : 3 Value : 1234.5678 Type : 3 Value : True Type : 1  You’ll notice that we only used a single instance of CFObject and that its  type changed based on the type of the value that was assigned to it.  In Depth A  CFObject  is  essentially  a  COM  wrapper  for  a  Core  Foundation   CFType   object  inside QuickTime. CFObject provides a convenient COM interface to the data while allowing the data itself to remain in its native internal format for efﬁciency.  Core Foundation is one of the core frameworks of Apple’s OS X operating system. The various data types wrapped by CFObject are the fundamental data types used extensively within OS X and OS X applications. Developers working with OS X will be intimately famil- iar with these. Apple has ported elements of the OS X Core Foundation over to Windows in order to support the cross-platform QuickTime API.  Each CFObjectType in the QuickTime COM library corresponds to a CFType, as shown in Table 5.8. For convenience, CFObjects of a particular type are often referred to by their equivalent CFType name, so a CFObject of type CFObjectTypeDictionary is simply termed a CFDictionary.  CFObject and Its Uses 123   Table 5.8  CFObjectType and Corresponding CFType CFObjectType  Equivalent CFType  CFObjectTypeBoolean CFObjectTypeNumber CFObjectTypeString CFObjectTypeArray CFObjectTypeDictionary CFObjectTypeData CFObjectTypeInvalid  CFBoolean CFNumber CFString CFArray CFDictionary CFData —  CFObject Collection  In addition to holding primitive Boolean, Number, and String data values, a CFObject can also act as a collection of other CFObjects, either in the form of an array  CFObjectTypeArray  or a dictionary  CFObjectTypeDictionary . The items in an array or dictionary type CFObject are child items of the CFObject and may be accessed using its ChildItems property; this returns a collection  CFObjects . Like any collection object, CFObjects has a Count property that returns  the  number  of  items  in  the  collection,  and  an  Item  property  that returns an item  CFObject  from the collection. You can iterate over the items in a CFObjects collection just as you would with any other collection:  For i = 1 To cf.ChildItems.Count   'Do something Next  A CFObject containing an array is often referred to simply as a CFArray  after the Core Foundation type that it wraps  and a dictionary is a CFDic- tionary. We now look at this pair of collection objects in detail.  CFObject Array  CFArray   To create a CFArray, we ﬁrst create a new instance of a CFObject and set its type to CFObjectTypeArray. Then we can start adding other CFObjects to the array. Here’s a code example that shows how to create and populate a CFAr- ray and then how to list its contents:  124 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   'Make the CFObject an array cfArray.Type = CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeArray  Dim cfArray As New CFObject Dim cf As New CFObject Dim s As String Dim i As Long  'Add items to the array cf.Value = 1234.5678 cfArray.AddItem cf   cf.Value = "Dung Beetle" cfArray.AddItem cf   cf.Value = True cfArray.AddItem cf   'List items in the array For i = 1 To cfArray.ChildItems.Count   cf = cfArray.ChildItems i    s += "Item " + CStr i  + ":" + vbCrLf   s += "  Type   : " + CStr cf.Type  + vbCrLf   s += "  Value : " + CStr cf.Value  + vbCrLf Next  tbResults.Text = s  This will produce the following output:  Item 1:   Type   : 3   Value : 1234.5678 Item 2:   Type   : 2   Value : Dung Beetle Item 3:   Type   : 1   Value : True  CFObject and Its Uses 125   CFObject  CFObjectTypeArray  CFObject                        1234.5678  CFObjectTypeNumber  CFObject                   "Dung Beetle" CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                 True CFObjectTypeBoolean  Figure 5.4 CFObject containing an array  CFArray .  The structure of the CFObjects collection that we’ve created is shown in  Figure 5.4.  CFObject Dictionary  CFDictionary   In a similar way, it is possible to create a dictionary of CFObjects contain- ing key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is a CFObject. A dictionary  is  a  collection  in  which  any  item  can  be  retrieved  with  a  key rather than just by index as with an array. This code example shows how to create a dictionary and then list all the items in it:  Dim cfDict As New CFObject Dim cf As New CFObject Dim s As String Dim i As Long  'Make the CFObject a dictionary cfDict.Type = CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeDictionary  'Add items to the dictionary cf.Value = "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" cfDict.AddItem cf, "Title"   cf.Value = "Eric Carle" cfDict.AddItem cf, "Author"   126 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   cf.Value = 1994 cfDict.AddItem cf, "Year"   cf.Value = True cfDict.AddItem cf, "Classic"   'List items in the dictionary For i = 1 To cfDict.ChildItems.Count   cf = cfDict.ChildItems i    s += "Item " + CStr i  + ":" + vbCrLf   s += "  Key   : " + cf.Key + vbCrLf   s += "  Type  : " + CStr cf.Type  + vbCrLf   s += "  Value : " + CStr cf.Value  + vbCrLf Next  'Get item by key s += vbCrLf s += "Name : " + cfDict.ChildItems.ItemByKey "Title" .Value + vbCrLf  tbResults.Text = s  Note  that  each  time  we  use  AddItem  to  add  an  item,  we  must  pass  the name  of  the  key  in  the  second  parameter.  The  output  from  the  preceding code is as follows:  Item 1:   Key   : Title   Type  : 2   Value : The Very Hungry Caterpillar Item 2:   Key   : Author   Type  : 2   Value : Eric Carle Item 3:   Key   : Year   Type  : 3   Value : 1994 Item 4:   Key   : Classic   Type  : 1   Value : True  Name : The Very Hungry Caterpillar  CFObject and Its Uses 127   CFObject  CFObjectTypeDictionary  "Title"  "Author"  "Year"  "Classic"  CFObject            "The Very Hungry Caterpillar"  CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                       "Eric Carle" CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                                 1994 CFObjectTypeNumber  CFObject                            True CFObjectTypeBoolean  = key  Figure 5.5 CFObject containing a dictionary  CFDictionary .  Figure 5.5 shows the structure of the dictionary we’ve created.  The Annotations CFDictionary  Browsing through the QuickTime Object Model, you will ﬁnd the CFObject used in a number of cases to hold complex structured data. One example is the Annotations property of the QTMovie and QTTrack objects, which returns all of the annotations that exist in the movie or track packaged as a CFObject of type CFObjectTypeDictionary.   Dim cf As CFObject  If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub  cf = AxQTControl1.Movie.Annotations  The CFObject that we get back contains a dictionary of key-value pairs, one for each annotation. The key for each annotation is the four-character ID of the annotation as a string  e.g., "albm" = qtAnnotationAlbum , while the value is another CFObject. In other words the Annotations dictionary contains a col- lection of child CFObjects keyed on annotation ID as illustrated in Figure 5.6.  128 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   CFObject  CFObjectTypeDictionary  Annotations  "albm"  "arts"  "cprt"  "name"  "cpil"  "gnre"  CFObject                                               Album CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                                 Artist  CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                          Copyright CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                         Full Name CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                       Compilation CFObjectTypeNumber  CFObject                                      Genre Code CFObjectTypeData                 2 Bytes  Figure 5.6 Annotations CFObject as a CFDictionary of key-value pairs.  = key  It’s easy to iterate over the items in the Annotations dictionary:  Dim cf As CFObject, cfAnn As CFObject Dim s As String Dim i As Long  If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub  cf = AxQTControl1.Movie.Annotations  For i = 1 To cf.ChildItems.Count   cfAnn = cf.ChildItems i    If cfAnn.Type = CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeString Then     s += "Item " + CStr i  + ":" + vbCrLf     s += "  Key   : " + cfAnn.Key + vbCrLf     s += "  Value : " + cfAnn.Value + vbCrLf  CFObject and Its Uses 129     End If Next  tbResults.Text = s  Notice that not all the annotations in the dictionary shown in Figure 5.6  typical  of  an  iTunes  song   share  the  same  data  type.  In  addition  to  the strings, the "cpil" annotation is a number while the "gnre" annotation is of type  CFObjectTypeData and contains 2 bytes of data. This explains why, in the preceding example, we tested the Type of each item to make sure it was a string, since our simple code assumes that the value is a string.  We  end  up  with  a  useful  dump  of  all  the  string  annotations  within  the  movie:  P   1996 Ricordi  Item 1:   Key   : cprt   Value :  Item 2:   Key   : name   Value : Sotto vento Item 3:   Key   : arts   Value : Ludovico Einaudi Item 4:   Key   :  day   Value : 1996-10-04T07:00:00Z Item 5:   Key   : albm   Value : Le Onde  Individual annotations may be retrieved from the dictionary by key using  the ItemByKey property of the CFObjects collection:  s += "Name        : " + cf.ChildItems.ItemByKey "name" .Value + vbCrLf s += "Description : " + cf.ChildItems.ItemByKey "desc" .Value + vbCrLf s += "Comments    : " + cf.ChildItems.ItemByKey "cmmt" .Value + vbCrLf s += "Date        : " + cf.ChildItems.ItemByKey " day" .Value + vbCrLf s += "Copyright   : " + cf.ChildItems.ItemByKey "cprt" .Value + vbCrLf  130 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   Unfortunately,  the  CFObjects  collection  is  rather  unforgiving  if  we attempt to access an item in the dictionary that doesn’t exist: it will generate an exception. This is quite likely to happen with the preceding code since a movie may well be missing one or more annotations. A more robust solution is to use a function with an exception handler to get each annotation item:  'Returns the value of a CFDictionary item or empty string if not found Function GetDictionaryItem ByVal dict As CFObject,             ByVal key As String  As String    Dim val As String = ""    Try     val = dict.ChildItems.ItemByKey key .Value   Catch e As Exception     'Ignore error   End Try    GetDictionaryItem = val  End Function  s += "Name        : " + GetDictionaryItem cf, "name"  + vbCrLf s += "Description : " + GetDictionaryItem cf, "desc"  + vbCrLf s += "Comments    : " + GetDictionaryItem cf, "cmmt"  + vbCrLf s += "Date        : " + GetDictionaryItem cf, " day"  + vbCrLf s += "Copyright   : " + GetDictionaryItem cf, "cprt"  + vbCrLf  What  about  those  annotations  with  nonstring  values?  If  the  value  is  a number, then the value we get back is just a numeric System.Object  .NET  or Variant  VB6 :  s += "Compilation   : " + CStr GetDictionaryItem cf, "cpil"   + vbCrLf  yielding  Compilation : 1  However,  if  the  value  is  of  type  CFObjectTypeData,  then  the  value  is returned as an array of bytes. How we interpret this will of course depend  CFObject and Its Uses 131   entirely on the structure of the data. In the case of "gnre" we might hazard a guess that the 2 bytes represent an integer:  Dim b   As Byte b = cf.ChildItems.ItemByKey "gnre" .Value If IsArray b  Then   s += "Genre Code: " + CStr  b 0  * 256  + b 1   End If  yielding  Genre : 21  Complex CFObject Data Structures  An item in a CFDictionary or CFArray need not contain merely a value such as a number or a string; it can also contain a more complex CFObject, per- haps another CFDictionary or CFArray. In turn, these CFObjects may hold further child objects to create an arbitrary n-deep hierarchical data structure. As  an  example,  let’s  examine  the  CFObject  that  we  get  back  from  the PotentialExporters property of a QTMovie or QTTrack. This property returns a list of all the exporters that can potentially be used with the track or movie. If we check the type of the CFObject that we get back from this property, we ﬁnd that it has returned a CFDictionary. Examining one of the items of the CFDictionary, we discover that this in turn is yet another CFDictionary: so PotentialExporters gives us back a dictionary of dictionaries! The structure is shown in Figure 5.7. Each potential exporter in the dictionary has its own mini-dictionary  containing  three  values  keyed  on  ExporterKind,  Type,  and DefaultFileNameExtension.  Exploring such a structure would require a nested loop something like  Dim s As String Dim cfExporters As CFObject Dim cf As CFObject  If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub  cfExporters = AxQTControl1.Movie.PotentialExporters  132 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   Dim i, j As Long For i = 1 To cfExporters.ChildItems.Count   cf = cfExporters.ChildItems i    s += cf.Key + vbCrLf   For j = 1 To cf.ChildItems.Count     s += "  " + cf.ChildItems j .Key     s += " = " + cf.ChildItems j .Value + vbCrLf   Next Next  tbResults.Text = s  CFObject  CFObjectTypeDictionary  "MPEG-4"  CFObject  CFObjectTypeDictionary  Potential Exporters  "ExporterKind"  "Type"  CFObject                                             "Movie" CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                            "mpeg4" CFObjectTypeString  "DefaultFileNameExtension"  CFObject                                                "mp4" CFObjectTypeString  "PNG"  CFObject  CFObjectTypeDictionary  "ExporterKind"  "Type"  CFObject                                             "Image" CFObjectTypeString  CFObject                                              "PNGf"  CFObjectTypeString  "DefaultFileNameExtension"  CFObject                                                "png" CFObjectTypeString  Figure 5.7 Potential Exporters CFDictionary  partial .  = key  CFObject and Its Uses 133   Inspecting a Complex CFObject  Studying  the  structure  in  Figure  5.7,  you  may  immediately  recognize  the recursive  nature  of  the  “dolls-within-dolls”  structure.  Recursive  structures beg recursive algorithms, so let’s be ambitious and see if we can’t come up with a recursive function that will allow us to explore any CFObject, irrespec- tive of its structure or complexity. DumpCFObject is the surprisingly compact end result:  Sub DumpCFObject ByVal item As CFObject, ByRef depth As Long,              ByRef strOut As String     Dim i As Long   Dim s As String = ""   Dim key   Dim Value As String   Dim cfType As String    Dim indent As New String " ", depth * 3     Select Case item.Type     Case CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeDictionary : cfType =             " "     Case CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeArray : cfType = " "     Case CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeNumber : cfType = " "     Case CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeString : cfType = " "     Case CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeBoolean : cfType = " "     Case CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeData : cfType = " "     Case Else : cfType = " "   End Select    Select Case item.Type      Case CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeDictionary,              CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeArray        If IsDBNull item.Key  Then         s = cfType       Else         s = s + CStr item.Key  + " = " + cfType  134 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper         End If       strOut = strOut + indent + s + vbCrLf        For i = 1 To item.ChildItems.Count         DumpCFObject item.ChildItems i , depth + 1, strOut        Next i      Case Else        If IsDBNull item.Value  Then         Value = " "       Else         If item.Type = CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeData Then           If  IsArray item.Value   Then             Value = "[DATA : " +                CStr UBound item.Value  -                LBound item.Value  + 1  + " bytes]"           Else             Value = "DATA"           End If         Else           Value = CStr item.Value          End If       End If        If IsDBNull item.Key  Then         s = s + Value + " " + cfType       Else         s = s + CStr item.Key  + " = " + Value + " " + cfType       End If        If Len s    0 Then         strOut = strOut + indent + s + vbCrLf       End If    End Select  End Sub  CFObject and Its Uses 135   DumpCFObject takes a CFObject item  together with two additional ByRef  parameters:  tation   depth   :  the depth of recursion  used to generate the appropriate inden-  strOut  :  the string to which we append the output  To dump the contents of any CFObject, we simply call it as follows:  Dim s As String Dim cfExporters As CFObject  If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub  cfExporters = AxQTControl1.Movie.PotentialExporters  DumpCFObject cfExporters, 0, s   tbResults.Text = s  yielding something like the following extract:      MPEG-4 =       ExporterKind = Movie       Type = mpg4       DefaultFileNameExtension = mp4     QuickTime Movie =       ExporterKind = Movie       Type = MooV       DefaultFileNameExtension = mov     PNG =       ExporterKind = Image       Type = PNGf       DefaultFileNameExtension = PNG    So how exactly does DumpCFObject work? Well, it ﬁrst inspects the type of the CFObject that it has been passed. This will be either a simple value such as a number or string, or it may be a collection: either an array or dictionary. If it’s a simple value, all it has to do is print out the value and type. However, if the CFObject is a collection, life gets interesting: DumpCFObject then recur-  136 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   sively calls itself for each of the child objects in the collection, incrementing depth as it does so. The end result, as we’ve seen, is a neatly formatted con- tents dump of any arbitrary CFObject.  Before we leave DumpCFObject, it’s worth looking brieﬂy at how it copes with a CFObject of type CFObjectTypeData. This type of CFObject is not a col- lection since it contains a value, and this value is an array of bytes, which could  conceivably  be  of  any  length.  Printing  out  each  byte  seems  a  little pointless, so DumpCFObject just extracts the length of the array:  If item.Type = CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeData Then   If  IsArray item.Value   Then     Value = "[DATA : " + CStr UBound item.Value               - LBound item.Value  + 1  + " bytes]"  For example, if you DumpCFObject the Annotations of an iTunes song, the  Track Number annotation prints out something like  trkn = [DATA : 8 bytes]    For the irredeemably curious, though, peeking inside the data is not difﬁ- cult. The following addition prints out the data byte by byte in hex format, up to the ﬁrst 16 bytes:  If item.Type = CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeData Then   If  IsArray item.Value   Then     Value = "[" + CStr UBound item.Value  -              LBound item.Value  + 1  + " bytes]"     Value += " = ["     For i = LBound item.Value  To UBound item.Value        Value += Hex item.Value i  .PadLeft 2, "0"  + "."       If i > 16 Then         Value += "..."         Exit For       End If     Next i     Value += "]"   Else     Value = "DATA"   End If Else     Value = CStr item.Value  End If  CFObject and Its Uses 137   Calling DumpCFObject on the Annotations dictionary of a song purchased from  the  iTunes  Music  Store  yields  something  like  the  following—a  fertile tramping ground for the reverse engineering enthusiast:      artw = [564801 bytes] =              [89.50.4E.47.0D.0A.1A.0A.00.00.00.0D.49.48....]     trkn = [8 bytes] = [00.00.00.06.00.0D.00.00.]     cprt =   1996 Ricordi     atID = -1690603264     gnre = [2 bytes] = [00.0B.]     aART = Ludovico Einaudi     name = Tracce     meta = [567153 bytes] =              [00.00.00.00.00.00.00.22.68.64.6C.72.00.00....]     arts = Ludovico Einaudi     rtng = 0     apID = xxxx@yyyy.com      day = 1996-10-04T07:00:00Z     akID = 0     disk = [6 bytes] = [00.00.00.01.00.01.]     albm = Le Onde     cnID = -1354367547     geID = 218301808     plID = -4.6754886448544E+18    DumpCFObject comes in handy anywhere that the property of a QuickTime  object returns a CFObject. Here’s another example.  Inspecting QuickTime Event Parameters  Earlier in this chapter we saw that in a QTEvent handler, we can retrieve spe- ciﬁc  event  parameters  through  the  GetParam  method  of  QTEventObject,  as long as you know the ID of the parameter that you want. The eagle-eyed may also  have  spotted  a  GetParams  method;  this  returns  a  CFObject  dictionary containing all the event parameters. If you ever want to explore the parame- ters of a QuickTime event, just pop the following into your QTEvent handler:  138 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   'Dump event params Dim s As String Dim qtu As New QTUtils s = "Event ID: " + qtu.FourCharCodeToString e.eventID  + vbCrLf s += "[" DumpCFObject e.eventObject.GetParams, 0, s  s += "]" + vbCrLf Debug.Write s   Here’s  what  will  appear  in  your  output  window  for  a  selection  of  use-  ful events:  Event ID: cvol [    volm = 0.703125     ctxt = 0   ] Event ID: ctim [    time = 1640     ctxt = 0   ] Event ID: size [    size = 0, 0, 480, 640     ctxt = 0   ] Event ID: rate [    ctxt = 0     rate = 1   ]  Tip Event processing generally needs to be efﬁcient if it is not to impact on your application’s performance. Getting the parameters through the GetParams dictionary will inevitably be a lot less efﬁcient than getting them directly by ID using GetParam.  CFObject and Its Uses 139   Persistent CFObject  Given its ability to hold a data structure of arbitrary complexity, there is no reason why you shouldn’t take advantage of the CFObject class to hold your own  application  data,  as  well  as  for  interacting  with  QuickTime  objects. When we discover how easy it is to serialize the data to and from an XML string so that, for example, we can save data to disk and load it again, the case for using CFObject is compelling.  The  XML  property  of  CFObject  makes  all  this  possible.  This  property returns  an  XML  string  representation  of  both  the  data  and  the  structure contained in the CFObject. This is easiest to explain with a simple example. The  following  code  populates  a CFObject  with  some  data,  copies  the  XML property into a string, and then uses the string to load another CFObject:  Dim cfDict As New CFObject Dim cf As New CFObject Dim s As String Dim xml As String Dim i As Long  'Make the CFObject a dictionary cfDict.Type = CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeDictionary  'Add items to the dictionary cf.Value = "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" cfDict.AddItem cf, "Title"   cf.Value = "Eric Carle" cfDict.AddItem cf, "Author"   cf.Value = 1994 cfDict.AddItem cf, "Year"   cf.Value = True cfDict.AddItem cf, "Classic"   'Create another dictionary Dim cfDict2 As New CFObject cfDict2.Type = CFObjectTypesEnum.CFObjectTypeDictionary  140 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   cf.Value = "lettuce" cfDict2.AddItem cf, "Lunch"  cf.Value = "strawberry" cfDict2.AddItem cf, "Dessert"   'Add as child dictionary cfDict.AddItem cfDict2, "Food"   xml = cfDict.XML  s = "" DumpCFObject cfDict, 0, s   s += vbCrLf s += xml  'Create a new CFObject Dim cfNew As New CFObject  'Load it from the xml cfNew.XML = xml  s += vbCrLf  s += "Dessert : " +    cfNew.ChildItems.ItemByKey "Food" .ChildItems.ItemByKey              "Dessert" .Value    tbResults.Text = s  A DumpCFObject listing of the CFObject we’ve created looks like this:      Title = The Very Hungry Caterpillar     Classic = True     Food =       Lunch = lettuce       Dessert = strawberry     Year = 1994     Author = Eric Carle    CFObject and Its Uses 141   and the XML property returns the following:    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-  Apple Computer  DTD PLIST 1.0  EN"              "http:  www.apple.com DTDs PropertyList-1.0.dtd">        Author     Eric Carle     Classic         Food           Dessert       strawberry       Lunch       lettuce         Title     The Very Hungry Caterpillar     Year     1994       If we then load a new CFObject  cfNew  with the preceding XML, we end  up with exactly the same data that we had in our original object.  Querying it as follows  s += "Dessert : " +       cfNew.ChildItems.ItemByKey "Food"              .ChildItems.ItemByKey "Dessert" .Value    yields the expected result:  Dessert : strawberry  The XML format returned by the XML property of CFObject is in Apple’s standard Property List or PList format. This is well-formed XML and can eas- ily be imported and used by other XML parsers including System.XML.  142 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   Saving the contents of a CFObject to disk or, in software engineering par-  lance, making it persistent, is easily achieved using System.IO:  xml = cfDict.XML  'Save the XML to disk Dim sw As StreamWriter = File.CreateText "d:\aaa\cfobject.plist"  sw.Write xml  sw.Close    And  loading  a  CFObject  from  the  saved  XML  ﬁle  is  equally  straight-  'Create a new CFObject Dim cfNew As New CFObject  forward:  xml = ""  'Load CFObject from the XML on disk Dim sr As StreamReader = New StreamReader "d:\aaa\cfobject.plist"  xml = sr.ReadToEnd sr.Close    cfNew.XML = xml  Saving Exporter Settings  One obvious use of this facility to save a CFObject is to save exporter set- tings. Whenever we bring up an Exporter Settings dialog, there may be quite a few options that we need to set before we can perform the export. If we ever want to use those settings again, it’s a real pain if they all disappear the moment  we  dispose  of  the  exporter.  Now  we  have  a  ready  means  to  save such settings:  Dim exp As QTOLibrary.QTExporter = qt.Exporters 1   exp.TypeName = exporterType  'Load exporter settings if available fPath = Application.StartupPath + "\Settings" f = fPath + "\" + exporterType + ".plist"  CFObject and Its Uses 143   If File.Exists f  Then   Dim sr As StreamReader = New StreamReader f    Dim cf As New CFObject   Dim xml = sr.ReadToEnd   cf.XML = xml   exp.Settings = cf   sr.Close   End If  exp.ShowSettingsDialog    'Save exporter settings If Not Directory.Exists fPath  Then   Dim di As DirectoryInfo = Directory.CreateDirectory fPath  End If Dim sw As StreamWriter = File.CreateText f  sw.Write exp.Settings.XML  sw.Close    The preceding code is wrapped around the exporter call to ShowSettings- Dialog. After the Exporter Settings dialog is closed, the current settings are saved in a ﬁle called  .plist. Before the settings dialog is opened, we look for a ﬁle with the same name and, if found, we load any previously saved settings.  With  the  simple  addition  of  Open  File  and  Save  File  dialogs,  this  could easily be extended so that the user would be able to load and save any num- ber of speciﬁc export conﬁgurations. This is left as an exercise for the reader.  Error Handling  If  your  aim  is  to  create  a  rugged,  professional-grade  application,  then  you ignore error handling at your peril. Developing with the QuickTime Control and QuickTime objects is no different: nasty and unexpected things happen, especially when someone is so inconsiderate as to allow your precious soft- ware to get into the grubby hands of real users. It pays to anticipate this.  Fortunately, the .NET framework has a powerful error handling facility in the form of its Exceptions mechanism. Any code that is liable to generate an error  and  throw  an  exception  can  be  wrapped  with  a Try Catch   C:  try  catch  block so that any exceptions are caught before they wreak havoc else- where. This exception handling is available in both Visual Basic and C:  144 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   ' VB.NET Try    'Try something risky in here  Catch ex As Exception    'Catch and report exception errors in here    MsgBox ex.ToString   End Try     C try {    Try something risky in here } catch Exception ex  {    Catch and report exception errors in here    MessageBox.Show ex.ToString   ; }  The  QuickTime  COM  control  and  objects  can  also  generate  COM  excep- tions when things go wrong. To make sure this happens, you should always explicitly conﬁgure the ErrorHandling property of the QuickTime Control as soon as possible after the control is loaded:  AxQTControl1.ErrorHandling =              QTErrorHandlingOptionsEnum.qtErrorHandlingRaiseException  But  COM  exceptions  are  not  the  same  as  .NET  exceptions.  Fortu- nately,  the  COM  Interop  layer  comes  to  the  rescue  once  again  and ensures  that  anytime  a  COM  object  returns  an  error  or  raises  a  COM exception,  it  gets  translated  into  a  .NET  exception.  A  COM  error  code comes in the form of a 32-bit HRESULT. A few well-known HRESULT error codes  are  mapped  to  obvious  named  .NET  exceptions  such  as OutOfMemo- ryException  or  NullReferenceException,  but  the  vast  majority  are  lumped  Error Handling 145   together into a .NET exception known as a COMException, or more precisely as  System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException.  Since  COMException  is ultimately  derived  from  System.Exception,  it  behaves  just  like  a  regular .NET  exception  and  can  be  caught  in  the  catch-all  exception  handlers  we have illustrated.   First, we’ll look at how to handle a straightforward  and not uncommon  error. Here’s an example of some code that’s guaranteed to throw an excep- tion as we attempt to access a movie object that doesn’t exist:  AxQTControl1.URL = ""  Dim duration = AxQTControl1.Movie.Duration  And sure enough the resulting error message is predictably obtuse:  Adding the exception handler, as follows, this becomes somewhat more benign, although not a whole lot more meaningful. At least we have caught the exception and can choose to do something about it if we can.  Try    AxQTControl1.URL = ""   Dim duration = AxQTControl1.Movie.Duration  Catch ex As Exception    MsgBox ex.ToString   End Try  146 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   We can now see that this particular error has generated a standard Sys- tem.NullReferenceException  rather  than  a  COMException.  That’s  simply because attempting to access objects that don’t exist is a not-infrequent prob- lem in .NET applications, the same as in any other application. We can of course improve on the error message:  Try    AxQTControl1.URL = ""   Dim duration = AxQTControl1.Movie.Duration  Catch ex As Exception    Dim msg As String   msg = "A calamitous event has occurred: I am so frightfully sorry!"   msg += vbCrLf + vbCrLf   msg += "Here are the details:" + vbCrLf   msg += ex.Message     MsgBox msg, MsgBoxStyle.Critical   End Try  Error Handling 147   If we are concerned with this particular error and would like to present a  polite message free from gobbledygook, we can always explicitly catch it:  Try    AxQTControl1.URL = ""   Dim duration = AxQTControl1.Movie.Duration  Catch ex As System.NullReferenceException    MsgBox "The movie doesn't exist, dummy!", MsgBoxStyle.Exclamation   Catch ex As Exception    MsgBox ex.ToString   End Try  So far we’ve handled a straightforward .NET exception even though it has emanated from the QTMovie object. What follows is some code that will cause an  error  deep  within  QuickTime  as  we  attempt  to  get  an  annotation  that doesn’t exist. The Annotation property of QTMovie will return an error that will, in turn, trigger a COM exception:  If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then   MsgBox "Please open a movie first and try again!",              MsgBoxStyle.Exclamation    Exit Sub End If  148 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper     Dim mov As QTMovie = AxQTControl1.Movie   Dim a = mov.Annotation 123456       'Causes the exception  Catch ex As Exception    Dim msg As String   msg = "An error occurred!"   msg += vbCrLf + vbCrLf   msg += ex.Message     MsgBox msg, MsgBoxStyle.Critical   Try  End Try  minating:  Even with the exception handler, the error message we get is far from illu-  The reason is that .NET knows nothing about the speciﬁc COM exception that occurred.   To get more details, we really need to trap the COMException explicitly:  If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then   MsgBox "Please open a movie first and try again!",              MsgBoxStyle.Exclamation    Exit Sub End If  Try  Error Handling 149     Dim mov As QTMovie = AxQTControl1.Movie   Dim a = mov.Annotation 123456  'Causes the exception  Catch ex As COMException    Dim msg As String   Dim qtu As New QTUtils   msg = "An error occurred!" + vbCrLf + vbCrLf   msg += "Error code : " + Hex ex.ErrorCode  + vbCrLf   msg += "QT Error code : " +              CStr qtu.QTErrorFromErrorCode ex.ErrorCode     MsgBox msg, MsgBoxStyle.Critical   Catch ex As Exception    'Catch and report exceptions errors in here   Dim msg As String   msg = "An error occurred!"   msg += vbCrLf + vbCrLf   msg += ex.Message     MsgBox msg, MsgBoxStyle.Critical   End Try  Once we have a COMException, we can obtain the all-important HRESULT error  code   in  this  case  the  hex  value  0x8004F77F   from  the  exception’s ErrorCode property. This is the error that originated in the QuickTime COM Control or in one of its child objects, and that triggered the COM exception in the ﬁrst place. Looking this up in the documentation should help us track down the source of the problem.  150 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   Embedded in the HRESULT may be an additional clue: if the HI word of the HRESULT equals 0x8004, then we can assume that the LO word is in fact  a  16-bit  QuickTime  error  code—in  this  case  0xF77F  or  -2177—which essentially  means  that  the  annotation  we  asked  for  could  not  be  found. QuickTime error codes like this can often be looked up in .h header ﬁles pro- vided with the QuickTime SDK. MacErrors.h is often a good place to start.  Exception  handling  can  sometimes  be  necessary  to  handle  even  routine occurrences. One example is in the following code that implements the File  Export menu item in Simple Player:  Private Sub mnuExport_Click ...  Handles mnuExport.Click    Dim qt As QTQuickTime = AxQTControl1.QuickTime    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    qt = AxQTControl1.QuickTime    If qt.Exporters.Count = 0 Then qt.Exporters.Add      Dim exp As QTExporter = qt.Exporters 1    exp.SetDataSource AxQTControl1.Movie    exp.ShowExportDialog    End Sub  If you happen to hit the Cancel button in the Export Dialog, the exporter will throw a COM exception with an HRESULT error code of 0x8004FF80. Clearly  this  should  not  be  considered  an  error,  and  so  we  can  tactfully ignore this particular error code in our COMException handler:  Private Sub mnuExport_Click ...  Handles mnuExport.Click    Dim qt As QTQuickTime = AxQTControl1.QuickTime    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub  Error Handling 151     Try    qt = AxQTControl1.QuickTime    If qt.Exporters.Count = 0 Then qt.Exporters.Add      Dim exp As QTExporter = qt.Exporters 1    exp.SetDataSource AxQTControl1.Movie    exp.ShowExportDialog      Catch ex As COMException      If ex.ErrorCode = &H8004FF80 Then       'Canceled - ignore      Else       Dim msg As String       msg = "An error occurred!" + vbCrLf + vbCrLf       msg += "Error code : " + Hex ex.ErrorCode  + vbCrLf       MsgBox msg, MsgBoxStyle.Critical      End If    Catch ex As Exception      MsgBox ex.ToString     End Try  End Sub  As a general rule, make sure to add exception handling code to any rou- tines or functions in your code that involve input output  I O , such as open- ing movies or saving and exporting movies. Remember also that exceptions thrown in lower-level routines percolate up the calling chain and are caught in  the  exception  handling  code  of  higher-level  functions.  However,  if  you depend  entirely  on  this,  you  will  often  miss  out  on  the  speciﬁc  context  in which an exception occurred in a low-level function.  152 Chapter 5 Diving Deeper   Summary  If  you’ve  completed  this  chapter  and  spent  some  time  perusing  the  code samples  available  online  at  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples,  you  should feel considerably more conﬁdent about tackling real-world QuickTime appli- cations. The judicious use of QuickTime events will ensure that your appli- cation performs well in an event-driven environment. Well-thought-out error handling will contribute to a robust application, while comprehensive error reporting will help in tracking down any problems that do arise, whether the source  is  in  your  application  or  in  QuickTime  itself.  Familiarity  with  the CFObject data container ensures that you will be in a position to use some of the more powerful features of the QuickTime COM objects, with the added bonus  of  a  useful  general-purpose  container  class  to  add  to  your  bag  of tricks.   If you’re working with QuickTime content in a production environment or  developing  software  tools  for  production,  the  ability  to  access  Quick- Time’s metadata capabilities can be a major bonus.  Summary 153                                 6  Create and Edit 6 Creating and Editing QuickTime Content  Introduction  Not  many  years  ago,  the  process  of  video  production  and  editing  was mainly  the  preserve  of  an  exclusive  priesthood  of  professionals  working with  expensive  equipment,  and  even  more  expensive  software,  usually  in the  hallowed  studios  of  television  and  movie  production  companies.  How things  have  changed!  It  seems  that  almost  anyone  with  a  handheld  DV camera  and  a  home  computer  is  now  an  aspiring  video  editor,  capable  of transforming  those  hours  of  insipid  poolside  footage   you  know  the  kind: little  Jack  on  the  waterslide;  little  Jill  on  the  waterslide;  Jack  going  down the  waterslide  head-ﬁrst,  upside-down,  backwards;  Jack  being  ejected  by the  pool  attendant…   into  gripping  hour-long  episodes  peppered  with  spe- cial  video  effects  and  captions.  Millions  of  grandparents  will  happily attest to the soporiﬁc effects of their output.  While  dramatically  lowered  hardware  size  and  cost  have  undoubtedly contributed  to  this  democratization  of  video  production,  advances  in video-editing software have been no less signiﬁcant. In recent years Apple has  led  the  way,  both  with  its  professional-grade,  yet  affordable  Final  Cut ,  the  home  video-editing  pack- Pro age.  It  shouldn’t  come  as  a  surprise  to  learn  that  both  of  these  applica- tions draw heavily upon QuickTime.    and,  at  a  more  basic  level,  with   iMovie  While  few  of  us  will  aspire  to  creating  video  production  applications  as sophisticated as these, the underlying video creation and editing capabilities of QuickTime do provide a powerful platform for developing both commer- cial and in-house content production applications. In this chapter we examine the  editing  and  content  creation  features  of  QuickTime  that  are  exposed through the QuickTime COM Control and object library.  155                          The Joy of Cut, Copy, and Paste  When it comes to basic movie creation and editing, such as the compilation of  multiple  short  clips,  or  shots,  into  a  single  movie,  the  Pro  version  of QuickTime Player can be perfectly adequate. It has the undeniable advan- tages of simplicity and low cost. Much can be achieved simply by opening movies  in  multiple  QuickTime  Player  windows,  copying  and  pasting between them, and ﬁnally saving or exporting the result.  Implementing the Edit Menu  Since  much  of  this  capability  derives  from  the  Edit  menu  in  QuickTime Player, let’s begin by looking at what it takes to add a similar Edit menu to the Simple Player application that we kicked off with in Chapter 2. The start- ing point, of course, is to add and populate the Edit menu in Visual Studio. As you insert the menu items, don’t forget to add the requisite standard key- board shortcut to each menu item. You should end up with a menu like that shown in Figure 6.1.  Now we can add the code behind the menu items. It turns out that most of the edit functions can be implemented as single-line calls to the appropri-  Figure 6.1  Simple Player showing basic Edit menu.  156  Chapter 6   Create and Edit                                                                      ate methods of the  Edit menu items together in one single event handler:  QTMovie   object, and so it seems logical to handle all the  Private Sub OnEditMenu_Click ByVal sender As System.Object,              ByVal e As System.EventArgs       Handles mnuUndo.Click, mnuCut.Click,              mnuCopy.Click, mnuPaste.Click,              mnuDelete.Click, mnuSelectAll.Click,             mnuSelectNone.Click    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    With AxQTControl1.Movie      If sender Is mnuUndo Then       .Undo       ElseIf sender Is mnuCut Then       .Cut       ElseIf sender Is mnuCopy Then       .Copy       ElseIf sender Is mnuPaste Then       .Paste       ElseIf sender Is mnuDelete Then       .DeleteSelection       ElseIf sender Is mnuSelectAll Then       .SelectAll       ElseIf sender Is mnuSelectNone Then       .SelectionDuration = 0     End If    End With  End Sub  sender  The   object that we are passed as a parameter to the event handler comes into play here: we compare it with each of the menu items in turn until we ﬁnd the   object that it matches. Note that the apparently more suitable   statement can’t be used here since it only copes with   MenuItem Case  =  equivalence     equivalence      and not   Select  object  value  Is   .     The Joy of Cut, Copy, and Paste  157                                                   Saving the Movie  Now  that  we  have  an  Edit  menu,  we  can  open  a  movie,  shufﬂe  sections around  by  cutting  from  one  part  of  the  movie  and  pasting  into  another, delete bits out of it, and generally monkey around with the movie. Once we are happy with the result, we will want to save the movie to disk. Any self-respecting editor application will have both Save and Save As… menu items in the File menu. Implementing the Save menu item is trivial:  Private Sub mnuSave_Click ...  Handles mnuSave.Click    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    AxQTControl1.Movie.Save    End Sub  Implementing  Save  As…  to  save  the  movie  to  a  different  ﬁle  is  pretty  straightforward as well:  Private Sub mnuSaveAs_Click ...  Handles mnuSaveAs.Click    If AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub    SaveFileDialog1.Title = "Save Movie As"   SaveFileDialog1.FileName = "Untitled.mov"   If SaveFileDialog1.ShowDialog   = DialogResult.OK Then     AxQTControl1.Movie.SaveSelfContained SaveFileDialog1.FileName      End If  End Sub  The Windows Forms  name and location.  SaveFileDialog   component is used to prompt for a ﬁle  Save  Note  that  in  this  case  we  use  the  movie’s     method rather than  . If you are already familiar with QuickTime Player, you will know that when you save an existing movie that you have edited, the edits are  saved  in  the  movie  ﬁle,  but  the  data  within  the  movie  ﬁle  remains Save- unchanged. This is for efﬁciency, especially when editing large ﬁles.  SelfContained   saves  all  of  the  movie  data  into  a  speciﬁed  new  ﬁle.  We  SaveSelfContained  158  Chapter 6   Create and Edit                                                            explore the distinction in more detail later in this chapter in “Saving a New Movie.”  Creating a New Movie  Editing and saving existing movies is all ﬁne and well, but many of us have a yearning to create something new and original. The starting point for this is an empty movie, which we obtain by calling the   method of mov- the QuickTime Control. This method sports a single optional parameter  ieIsActive  want our new movie to be active so that we  if we leave it out, we can play it, and since  can often safely ignore this parameter. Enhancing the File menu in Simple Player, as shown in Figure 6.2, we can add a   : in general, we   CreateNewMovie  movieIsActive   defaults to    menu item.

The Joy of Cut, Copy, and Paste  159                              Figure 6.3  Simple Player with a new empty movie.  Choose File  New Movie, and Simple Player hosts an empty movie  Figure 6.3 , just inviting you to populate it with some exciting content.  The  simplest  way  to  add  anything—images,  video  clips,  sounds—to  this movie  is  by  pasting  them  from  the  clipboard.  While  this  may  sound  a  bit crude, it is quite an effective means of assembling a movie, especially when you remember that virtually any application is capable of putting something on the clipboard and can therefore serve as a content source. For example, if you copy an image from a graphics application such as Photoshop and select Edit  Paste in Simple Player, the image will be added to the movie as a single frame at the current time position. If the dimensions of the image are larger than the current movie size, the movie will be enlarged to accommodate this. By  pasting  in  a  sequence  of  images  one  by  one,  you  can  create  an  entire movie, albeit rather laboriously.  By employing QuickTime Player, or another instance of Simple Player as our content source, we can copy entire movies or movie selections onto the clipboard and paste them into the movie that we are assembling. Longer mov- ies can easily be created from a series of shorter movies in this way. Admit- tedly,  this  technique  is  a  rather  tedious  manual  route  to  a  ﬁnished  movie. Nonetheless,  if  we  can    both  the  source  player   opening  ﬁles  and copying to the clipboard  and the destination player  pasting in from the clip- board , we possess an eminently practical tool for assembling digital content.  automate  Movie Builder  In  order  to  illustrate  how  the  movie  creation  and  editing  features  of  the QuickTime Control and object library can be deployed in a real-world envi- ronment,  we  will  develop  a  sample  application  called  Movie  Builder.  The basic concept is quite simple: we open a source folder containing a collection of  movies,  and  these  individual  movies  are  then  automatically  assembled into a single composite movie. Later in this section, we will extend Movie  160  Chapter 6   Create and Edit                                                Builder with a few interesting bells and whistles. The Movie Builder sample can be found on the website  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples MovieBuilder  Assembling a Movie  The Movie Builder user interface is shown in Figure 6.4. At the top there is a CheckedListBox1 Source frame containing a    on the left, with a QuickTime COM Control     beside it. The idea is that, on choosing File  Select Source Folder…, all the ﬁles  movies, images, . Clicking audio ﬁles, etc.  in the source folder are listed in    control   AxQTControl1  CheckedListBox1  CheckedListBox  Figure 6.4  Movie Builder.  Movie Builder  161                                                    on any ﬁle name will open and display that ﬁle as a movie in the QuickTime Control opposite. In the Destination frame below, we have another Quick- Time COM Control     in which the new movie will be assem- bled, as well as a     in which we can log activity.  AxQTControl2  TextBox  tbLog     Once the list of source ﬁles is populated, we can uncheck any ﬁles that we don’t  want  to  assemble  into  our  composite  movie  and  then  choose  Tools   Build Movie. This will create a new empty movie in the destination Quick- Time Control, and then, opening each source movie in turn, it will append them one by one to the destination movie. At that point we can choose File  Save As… or File  Export… to save or export the movie that has just been assembled.  FolderBrowserDialog  First let’s look at the code for opening a folder and populating the list of   component,  we  prompt  for  the  path  to m_SourcePath .   is  then  populated  with  the  names  of  all  the  ﬁles  in  that  ﬁles.  Using  a  the  source  folder,  which  we  then  stash  in  member  variable  CheckedListBox1 folder:  Private Sub mnuSelectSource_Click ...  Handles mnuSelectSource.Click    Dim srcFile As String    If m_SourcePath   "" Then     FolderBrowserDialog1.SelectedPath = m_SourcePath   End If   If FolderBrowserDialog1.ShowDialog   = DialogResult.OK Then      m_SourcePath = FolderBrowserDialog1.SelectedPath     lblSource.Text = m_SourcePath      CheckedListBox1.Items.Clear        Dim srcFiles As String   = Directory.GetFiles m_SourcePath, "*.*"      If srcFiles.Length = 0 Then Exit Sub      For Each srcFile In srcFiles       Dim fi = New FileInfo srcFile        CheckedListBox1.Items.Add fi.Name, True      Next    End If  End Sub  162  Chapter 6   Create and Edit                                                                      Adding some code to handle the   SelectedIndexChanged    allows  us  to  load  and  display  a  ﬁle  in   AxQTControl1   event of   Checked-   any  time  an  ListBox1 item is selected.  Private Sub CheckedListBox1_SelectedIndexChanged ...               Handles CheckedListBox1.SelectedIndexChanged    Dim msg As String = ""   Dim fName As String = CheckedListBox1.SelectedItem.ToString      Try      Dim f = m_SourcePath + "\" + fName      Cursor.Current = Cursors.WaitCursor     AxQTControl1.URL = f     Cursor.Current = Cursors.Default    Catch ex As COMException      msg = "Error loading file: " + fName     msg += "  " + Hex ex.ErrorCode  + " "    End Try  End Sub    StatusBar1.Text = msg  Note the exception handler: there is a distinct possibility of something going wrong should we attempt to load a corrupt ﬁle, or a ﬁle type that cannot be imported by QuickTime.  out  An interesting and useful reﬁnement would be the ability to deﬁne the   in  points for each source clip so that, rather than appending the entire and  clip to the destination movie, only that portion of the clip between its   and  points gets added. The movie selection is ideally suited to this purpose, out as  Figure  6.5  illustrates,  since  it  is  possible  to  set  the  selection  using  the movie controller bar  just hold down the Shift key while clicking and drag- ging in the controller . An added bonus is that the current selection is saved whenever  the  movie  is  saved  so  that  the    points  can  be  perma- nently saved for any clip.    and   out  in  in  Movie Builder  163                      Figure 6.5 Movie showing in and out points as start and end of the movie selection.  Even more useful for our editor users would be a real-time display of the position and length of the selection. This is easily accomplished by register- ing  for  the    event  from  the  movie  so  that we are notiﬁed any time the selection changes.  qtEventMovieSelectionDidChange  With these additions, our   SelectedIndexChanged handler starts to become a little more complex. To ensure that any changes to the movie selection are saved  before  another  movie  is  opened,  we  check  the m_bSelectionChanged ﬂag and save the movie if necessary:  'Save changes to current movie If Not AxQTControl1.Movie Is Nothing Then   With AxQTControl1.Movie     If m_bSelectionChanged And .CanUpdateMovieFile Then       AxQTControl1.Movie.Save       End If   End With End If  Unnecessary  movie  saves  are  avoided  by  using  the  Boolean  ﬂag m_bSelectionChanged,  which  gets  set  any  time  the  movie  selection  is changed in our qtEventMovieSelectionDidChange handler:  Private Sub AxQTControl1_QTEvent ...

The timecode format is as follows:   : : .  = hh:mm:ss.tt  Movie Builder 165   Hours, minutes, and seconds should be self-explanatory: the fourth ﬁeld rep- resents a fraction of a second and is denominated in units of movie time, as deﬁned by the movie’s time scale. So, if a movie has a typical time scale of 600, the last ﬁeld would be in the range 0–599. For example, the timecode 01:35:46.120 is equivalent to 1 hour, 35 minutes, 46 seconds, and 120 600ths of a second, for a movie whose time scale is 600. In passing, it’s worth noting that if the movie’s frame rate is the same as its time scale, the last ﬁeld may also be interpreted as frames—hh:mm:ss.ff.

The ﬁrst thing to do  Movie Builder 167   is to create a new empty destination movie in AxQTControl2 using CreateNew- Movie.  Then  we  need  to  in CheckedListBox1 using its convenient CheckedItems collection. Each source movie is loaded in turn into AxQTControl1; the selection can be copied to the clipboard and then pasted into the destination movie  AxQTControl2  using just a few lines of code:  iterate  over  the  checked  ﬁle  names   If AxQTControl1.Movie.SelectionDuration = 0 Then   AxQTControl1.Movie.SelectAll   End If  AxQTControl1.Movie.Copy   AxQTControl2.Movie.Paste    While this does indeed serve the purpose perfectly adequately, copy and paste via the clipboard is really a bit of a blunt instrument, and it can be slow. Fortunately,  there  is  a  better  way:  the  InsertSegment  method  of  QTMovie directly  copies  a  movie  segment  from  another QTMovie  object,  avoiding  the need for the clipboard stopover entirely. This useful method has the following parameters, the last three of which are optional:  srcMovie  : The source QTMovie object from which the segment is to  be copied.  srcStartTime   srcDuration  : The start time  in movie units  of the selection to be cop- ied from the source movie. Defaults to the current selec- tion start time if not supplied.  : The duration  in movie units  of the selection to be cop- ied from the source movie. Defaults to the current selec- tion duration if not supplied.  insertionTime : The time position  in movie units  at which the new seg- ment should be inserted. Defaults to the current time if not supplied.  Rather  than  relying  too  much  on  the  defaults  for  optional  parameters   never a great idea , we will specify them fully as follows:  If AxQTControl1.Movie.SelectionDuration = 0 Then   AxQTControl1.Movie.SelectAll   End If  168 Chapter 6 Create and Edit   AxQTControl2.Movie.InsertSegment AxQTControl1.Movie,             AxQTControl1.Movie.SelectionStart,             AxQTControl1.Movie.SelectionDuration,             AxQTControl2.Movie.Duration   This appends the current selection from AxQTControl1.Movie to the end of the movie in AxQTControl2 and is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than the equiv- alent copy and paste option.  The complete build movie routine is as follows:  Private Sub mnuBuildMovie_Click ...

Imagine  that  our  ﬂedgling  Movie Builder  application  is  destined  for  one  of  these  identity-obsessed  corpora- tions and that we’ve been asked to provide a facility to automatically overlay the logo on each newly created movie.  Conceptually  this  is  not  particularly  difﬁcult  in  QuickTime:  all  that’s required is to have the logo graphic in a separate video track that is in paral- lel with, and the same length as, the content video track  Figure 6.6 . So long as the logo track is above the content track in the z-order, and is positioned correctly relative to the video track, QuickTime will ensure that the logo is superimposed on the entire movie clip.  Well, so much for the theory, but how do we achieve this in practice? We need some means of creating another video track. This comes in the guise of  Video track 1 content  Video   track 2  logo  Video track 2—logo   Video track 1—content  Figure 6.6 Logo  video  track  superimposed  on  content  video  track  showing  spatial  arrangement   above  and temporal arrangement  below .

In the case of Add, the new track starts at the beginning of the cur- rent selection, or the current movie time if there is no selection; the length of the  new  track  is  the  length  of  whatever  was  on  the  clipboard.  With Add- Scaled,  the  length  of  the  new  track  is  scaled  to  the  length  of  the  current movie selection or, if there is no selection, to the length of the entire movie. Figure 6.7 illustrates the difference. In both cases the X-Y dimensions of the new track will match those of whatever is on the clipboard.  So,  in  order  to  superimpose  a  logo  on  the  movie,  we  can  copy  a  logo graphic  of  the  correct  size  to  the  clipboard   perhaps  using  AxQTControl1 , select the entire destination movie, and then call AddScaled:  AxQTControl2.Movie.SelectAll   AxQTControl2.Movie.AddScaled    The logo will end up deposited in the top-left corner of our movie, and this may not be where we would ideally like to see it. However, since the logo is in a new track of its own, we can use the spatial properties of the track to position it wherever we want—perhaps in the top-right corner of the movie.  WithAxQTControl2.Movie   Dim trkLogo As QTTrack = .Tracks .Tracks.Count    If Not trkLogo Is Nothing Then     trkLogo.left = .right - trkLogo.Width - 10  172 Chapter 6 Create and Edit       trkLogo.top = 10   End If End With  Note that since the logo track has just been added to the movie, it is always going to be the last track in the Tracks collection of the movie at this point.  While we’re at it, we can impart a more professional look to the logo by blending it with the movie. When QuickTime renders a visual track, it uses the track’s transfer mode to determine how the track is rendered onto the movie. The default transfer mode for a video track is a dither copy  qtTrans- ferModeDitherCopy  that simply copies the track onto the underlying movie. By changing the TransferMode property of the logo track to one of the blend modes  see QTTransferModesEnum , the logo will be blended with the underly- ing movie. We even have some control over the degree of transparency with the  OperationColor  property,  which  takes  a  triplet  of  RGB  values   in  the range 0–65535  in the form of a comma-delimited string. The ultimate effect will of course depend on the combination of colors in the logo and the back- ground movie itself. Finally, to ensure that QuickTime carries out this ren- dering operation to best effect, we set the track’s HighQualityMode to True.  trkLogo.TransferMode =              QTTransferModesEnum.qtTransferModeStraightAlphaBlend trkLogo.OperationColor = "32768, 32768, 32768"       '50% trkLogo.HighQualityMode = True  The end result is a logo neatly ensconced in the top corner of our movie as  shown in Figure 6.8.

Tempting though it is to disabuse him of such a notion, coming as it does so late on a Friday afternoon, we have to grudgingly admit that, at least concep- tually anyhow, this most certainly is possible.  Live  text   as  opposed  to  text  that  is  burned  into  the  video  itself   in  a QuickTime movie resides in a special type of track known as a text track. A text track contains a series of text samples, each with a start time. Just like any other visual track, the text track can run in parallel with other tracks and may be superimposed on top of them. But how do we go about adding a text track to the movie?  If you launch QuickTime Player and point it at a plain text ﬁle, this should give  you  a  clue.  Player  will  indeed  open  the  ﬁle,  creating  a  text  track  and adding a sample for each line in the ﬁle. Play the resulting movie, and each text sample will appear one after another frame by frame as the movie plays: this is the QuickTime text importer in action. It does in fact provide rather more sophisticated control over the creation of text tracks from text ﬁles. The key to this is the use of a special text descriptor that describes the text format and the individual text samples.  The following is an example of a simple text descriptor ﬁle:  {QTtext} {timeScale:30} {width:150} {height:40} {timeStamps:absolute} {language:1} {textEncoding:0} {font:Verdana} {size:12} {bold} {justify:center} {dropShadow:off} {textColor: 65535, 65535, 65535} {backColor: 0, 0, 0} [00:00:00.00] Mary had a little lamb, [00:00:03.00] Her father shot it dead. [00:00:05.00] Now it goes to school with her [00:00:09.00] Between two chunks of bread. [00:00:12.00]  The  text  descriptor  always  begins  with  {QTtext},  which  is  usually  fol- lowed by some formatting details such as text font, size, and color. After that comes  a  series  of  text  samples,  each  with  a  starting  timecode  in  square  Movie Builder 175   brackets. The timecode in the very last line of the text descriptor is the time at which the text track should end, which often corresponds to the end of the movie. Full documentation for the QuickTime text descriptor format is avail- able at  http:  developer.apple.com documentation QuickTime REF  refDataExchange.6.htm  Opening the preceding text ﬁle in QuickTime Player, we get a movie with four frames, each displaying one text sample and lasting whatever length has been speciﬁed  Figure 6.9 .  To add our subtitles track in Movie Builder, we need to do the following:  1. Get the subtitle for each constituent movie: this could, for example, come  from the Full Name annotation  qtAnnotationFullName  of the movie.  2. Generate a text descriptor for the subtitles text track. This will contain a text sample for each of the individual movie clips that we used to build our composite movie, and each sample will begin at precisely the same time as each of the clips begins.  3. Save the subtitles text descriptor to a temporary ﬁle. 4. Open  the  subtitles  text  descriptor  ﬁle   in  a  QuickTime  Control  AxQTControl1 . If all goes well, the QuickTime text importer will ensure that we end up with a movie containing a single text track and of exactly the same length as our composite movie in AxQTControl2.  5. Copy the entire subtitles movie from AxQTControl1 to the clipboard. Add the  contents  of  the  clipboard  to  the  composite  movie  in  AxQTControl2. This will add a new subtitles text track in parallel with the movie, and at the top of the movie z-order so that it is superimposed on top of any other video track s .  6. Position and format the subtitles text track.  [00:00:00.00]  [00:00:03.00]  [00:00:05.00]  [00:00:09.00]  [00:00:12.00]  Mary had a little lamb,  Her father shot    it dead.

Figure 6.9 Movie containing text track imported from text descriptor.  176 Chapter 6 Create and Edit   Let’s  look  at  the  code  required  to  generate  the  text  descriptor.  The  ﬁrst thing to do is to write out the header formatting information for the track and text, carefully inserting the TimeScale and Width of the movie that we eventually want this track to overlay:  Dim td As String  If AxQTControl2.Movie Is Nothing Then Exit Sub  td = "" td += "{QTtext} " td += "{timeScale:" + CStr AxQTControl2.Movie.TimeScale  + "} " td += "{width:" + CStr AxQTControl2.Movie.Width  + "} " td += "{height:22}" + vbCrLf td += "{timeStamps:absolute} {language:1} {textEncoding:0}" + vbCrLf td += "{font:Verdana} {size:12} {bold} {justify:center}              {dropShadow:off}" + vbCrLf td += "{textColor: 65535, 65535, 65535} {backColor: 0, 0, 0}" +              vbCrLf  The next step is to iterate over the constituent movie clips just as we did earlier  to  build  the  movie,  except  that  this  time  we  write  out  a  timecode  currentTime, the cumulative time position in the movie  and the text  qt- AnnotationFullName  for each subtitle, followed, at the very end, by a ﬁnal timecode corresponding to the end of the movie.

The movie in AxQTControl2 is the new composite movie that we built earlier, and that in AxQTControl1 contains the subtitles text track. Combining the latter into the former, via the clipboard, is the next step.  Copying the entire text track movie, we Add it into the destination movie at Time = 0, creating a new text track in parallel with the existing movie. Note  that  AddScaled  is  not  what  we  want  here  since  both  movies  should be the same length in the ﬁrst place, and even if they weren’t, scaling the text  track  to  ﬁt  the  movie  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  our  carefully generated timecodes.

At the core of all of this are the various edit methods of QTMovie, which are summarized in Table 6.1.  Creating a Movie from Images  At their most basic, movies are comprised of individual frames. When creat- ing QuickTime content, it is not unusual to have, as a starting point, a folder containing dozens—perhaps hundreds—of individual images that will end up as frames in the movie. Combining these together into a single movie can easily be accomplished using the same technique that we’ve used in Movie Builder, namely, opening an image in one QuickTime Control and inserting it  into  another.  In  fact,  if  you  simply  select  a  folder  of  images  in  Movie Builder, creating a movie from them will work perfectly well. You will end up with a movie containing a frame for each image with a default frame rate of 15 fps  frames per second . This movie can, of course, then be exported in any format you like.  But, yet again, there is an easier—and more efﬁcient—way that involves handing  more  of  the  drudgery  over  to  QuickTime.  This  is  the CreateNew- MovieFromImages  method  of  the  QuickTime  Control,  which  happily  does exactly what it says on the label and creates for us a new movie from a folder full  of  images.  The  only  proviso  is  that  the  images  should  be  sequentially numbered  so  that  QuickTime  knows  what  order  you  want  your  movie’s frames in. So, for example, the ﬁrst image might be Frame0001.png, the sec- ond Frame0002.png, and so on. The source of the image sequence is immate- rial:  it  might  have  been  exported  from  an  animation  or  a  3D  rendering package, or it could be the product of time-lapse photography of a growing bacterial culture—anything that can produce a sequence of image ﬁles.

Indeed, this is the way in which many of us tackle DIY jobs: we start out with a grand idea and dive in with more enthusiasm than ability, cob- bling bits together and tacking things on. The sensible alternative, of course, would be to devote our energies to sketching out proper plans, before hand- ing the whole lot over to a professional builder and heading to the mountains for a few days.  Well, the good news, at this point in our story, is that QuickTime is that construction  professional:  everything  that  we  so  laboriously  achieved  with our carefully crafted code in Movie Builder—well, QuickTime can just about do it all for us. All we need do is draw up the plans and hand them over.  The secret here is SMIL  pronounced, "smile"  or Synchronized Multimedia Integration  Language,  an  XML-based  description  language  for  integrating diverse media elements into a single synchronized presentation. SMIL is a W3C  recommendation  and,  as  such,  enjoys  widespread  industry  support. QuickTime supports a useful subset of the SMIL standard and offers a few extensions of its own. If we can describe the composite movie we want in SMIL, then QuickTime can import our SMIL description and present us with the ﬁnished movie, so the theory goes.  New to SMIL?  If you’re new to SMIL, there are several good tutorials out there on the Web, and I would recommend skimming through at least one of them before continuing.  W3 School  www.w3schools.com smil default.asp  QuickTime and SMIL  http:  developer.apple.com documentation QuickTime IQ_InteractiveMovies  quicktimeandsmil chapter_10_section_1.html  Synchronized Multimedia on The Web  www.webtechniques.com archives 1998 09 bouthillier   The easiest way to explain the power of SMIL, in this context, is to assem- ble  a  SMIL  document  that  describes,  as  closely  as  possible,  the  composite movie that we were able to create with Movie Builder. You will recall that this consisted of a series of movies concatenated together into a single movie, with the addition of logo and subtitle overlays.  A  SMIL  document  has  two  main  sections:  the     section  that describes the layout and the   section that deﬁnes the content that gets presented in the layout. The   section deﬁnes one or more regions,  184 Chapter 6 Create and Edit   and each media element in the body section is then associated with a partic- ular region. A very simple SMIL document that presents a single movie looks like this:    <smil xmlns:qt="http:  www.apple.com quicktime resources              smilextensions"     qt:time-slider="true">                 <root-layout width="320" height="240"              background-color="white"  >                                           <video src=".. Birds 099178_V003_GreenWoodpecker.mov"              region="r1"  >              The   element is associated with region r1 and has a src attribute con- taining the URL to the movie itself. This URL can be absolute, or, as in this instance, it can be relative to the location of the SMIL document.  To  deﬁne  a  sequence  of  movies  one  after  the  other  in  SMIL,  we  use  a   element in the body section. When this sequence plays, each movie starts as soon as the previous movie has ﬁnished:                  <video src=".. Birds 087018_V002_BlChkdBeeeater.mov"              region="r1"  >     <video src=".. Birds 099178_V003_GreenWoodpecker.mov"              region="r1"  >              SMIL the Movie 185   Adding the logo is a little more of a challenge. We need to add an image element in parallel with the preceding sequence, and we need to make sure that it remains visible for the entire length of the sequence. Since the logo is in a different spatial location from the main video that plays in region r1, we need to deﬁne a new region r2 located in the top-right corner of the movie, as well as the correct size for our logo.                   Adding in the logo then involves adding a   or parallel   element,  whose src is our chosen logo graphic and which is located in region r2:                            <video src=".. Birds 087018_V002_BlChkdBeeeater.mov"              region="r1"  >       <video src=".. Birds 099178_V003_GreenWoodpecker.mov"              region="r1"  >                   <img region="r2" src=".. Birds Logo.png"             qt:composite-mode="blend;50%" end="id s1  end "  >        To  ensure  that  our  logo  doesn’t  ﬁzzle  out  before  the  end  of  our  movie sequence,  we  set  its  end  attribute  so  that  it  ends  at  the  same  time  as  the sequence whose id is s1:  end="id s1  end "  And, using one of the QuickTime SMIL extensions, we can even specify the graphics transfer mode for our logo, confusingly called qt:composite-mode:  qt:composite-mode="blend;50%"  186 Chapter 6 Create and Edit   Finally,  all  that  remains  is  to  overlay  the  subtitles.  For  these  we  will  require a third region, this time across the bottom of the movie:                       The subtitle itself can be described in a SMIL   element whose src  attribute contains, not a URL this time, but a QuickTime text descriptor:  <text src="data:text plain,{QTtext}{font:Arial}{size:12}{bold}             {width:320}{height:20} Puffin"        region="r3" end="id v1  end " qt:composite-mode="blend;50%"  >  The  text  descriptor  is  preﬁxed  with  a  data  speciﬁer  and  MIME  type  "data:text plain"  to distinguish it as in-line data rather than a URL, and it can specify a series of timecoded text samples just as we used earlier for cre- ating a text track.  To  add  the  subtitles,  we  need  another  parallel  track.  We  have  a  choice here. We could use a single   element in parallel with the entire movie sequence, containing a series of text samples carefully timed to appear at the point that each movie begins. Or, we could be a little lazier  or more robust, depending on your point of view  and simply add a   element in paral- lel with each of the movies in our sequence. Opting for the latter, we tie a   element to each video element inside a dedicated   element:          <text region="r3" end="id v1  end " qt:composite-mode="blend;50%"             src="data:text plain,{QTtext}{font:Arial}{size:12}{bold}             {width:320}{height:20} Puffin"  >    Notice again how we must force the text to hang out to the bitter end by slav- ing its end attribute to the end of the associated video track.

In practice, playback performance of SMIL sequences is not  always  what  it  should  be  in  QuickTime,  but  once  you  export  the sequence  as  a  new  movie,  you  will  end  up  with  a  movie  that  is  virtually indistinguishable from the one created the hard way.  SMIL is a serious tool in the portfolio of anyone working in QuickTime production. Since SMIL descriptions are well-formed XML, any software or tools that can generate or manipulate XML can readily be used, including the XML tools built into .NET in the form of System.Xml.  Unfortunately, the QuickTime SMIL implementation has remained rather static  since  its  inception  with  QuickTime  5,  so  many  of  the  features  of  the newer SMIL versions are not supported. This makes for interoperability prob- lems  with  other  SMIL  players.  Thus,  despite  its  promise,  SMIL  has  never really developed as a universal media integration standard, which is a pity.  Creating a Movie Using GDI  It’s not difﬁcult to think of cases where the frames for a movie come, not from  a  collection  of  image  ﬁles  somewhere  on  the  hard  disk,  but  directly from an application that generates them—perhaps using the graphical librar- ies supported by the .NET Framework, such as GDI+. This is likely to be the  Creating a Movie Using GDI 189   case, for example, with computer-generated graphics, or movie scenes ren- dered  using  powerful  dedicated  software,  or  perhaps  even  with  the  more prosaic output from a scientiﬁc experiment.  As  with  examples  earlier  in  this  chapter,  the  staging  ground  between graphic  and  movie  is  the  clipboard.  Each  time  our  application  generates  a new graphic, it must put it on the clipboard and then paste it into the movie under  construction.  This  technique  works  very  well,  the  only  downside being the evident inefﬁciency of copying to and from the clipboard.  Let’s look at a very simple example, this time in C for a change. We will create a movie by drawing its frames one by one, adding a random colored ball  in  each  frame   Figure  6.12 .  A  rather  trivial  example,  admittedly,  but given what could be done with GDI+, you will appreciate the potential. This sample can be found on the website  www skylark.ie qt4.net Samples GDICreateMovie  We  start  off  with  a  single  form  with  a  QuickTime  Control  on  it  axQTControl1  and a button. The ﬁrst thing we must do is create a Bitmap into  which  we  will  draw  each  frame.  We  keep  this  in  a  member  variable  m_bmpFrame  to avoid having to re-create it every time we draw a frame, and we initialize it in the form’s Load event handler:  Figure 6.12 Computer-generated movie.  190 Chapter 6 Create and Edit      C private Bitmap m_bmpFrame = null;  private void OnLoad object sender, System.EventArgs e  {   m_bmpFrame = new Bitmap 300,300 ; }  Clicking the button on the form gets the ball rolling, so to speak. In the initialization  process,  we  create  a  new  and  empty  movie  in axQTControl1, and clear m_bmpFrame to white. Generating the movie then involves calling AddNewMovieFrame repeatedly until we have as many frames as we want.     C private void OnCreateMovieClick object sender, System.EventArgs e  {   axQTControl1.CreateNewMovie true ;    int frameCount = 100;    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage m_bmpFrame ;   g.FillRectangle new SolidBrush Color.White ,              new Rectangle 0,0,320,240  ;   g.Dispose  ;    for int i = 0; i < frameCount; i++    {     AddNewMovieFrame axQTControl1.Movie ;   }    axQTControl1.Movie.SetSelection 0, 0 ;   axQTControl1.Movie.Time = 0;  }  Adding a new frame to the movie consists of drawing the new frame onto our  Bitmap,  setting  the  Bitmap  onto  the  clipboard,  and  ﬁnally  calling  the movie’s Paste method to actually append the frame to the movie:  Creating a Movie Using GDI 191      C private void AddNewMovieFrame QTOLibrary.QTMovie mov  {   DrawRandomBallFrame m_bmpFrame ;    DataObject dataobj = new DataObject  ;   dataobj.SetData DataFormats.Bitmap, m_bmpFrame ;   Clipboard.SetDataObject dataobj ;    if  mov != null      mov.Paste  ; }  DrawRandomBallFrame is the function that draws an individual frame, tak- ing the Bitmap as a parameter. Picking a random color and size, it plops a sin- gle ball somewhere on the Bitmap.     C private void DrawRandomBallFrame Bitmap bmp  {   Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage bmp ;   g.SmoothingMode = SmoothingMode.AntiAlias;    Random rand = new Random  ;    SolidBrush b = new SolidBrush Color.FromArgb rand.Next 255 ,             rand.Next 255 ,rand.Next 255   ;    int rad = rand.Next 100 ;   g.FillEllipse b, rand.Next bmp.Width , rand.Next bmp.Height ,              rad, rad ;    g.Dispose  ; }  Needless  to  say,  the  preceding  draw  function  could  do  something  con- siderably  more  sophisticated,  not  to  mention  useful,  and  that’s  really  the whole point of this exercise: if your application can generate potential movie frames using GDI+, and get them onto the clipboard, you are well on the way  to  being  able  to  generate  content  in  any  of  the  myriad  formats  that QuickTime supports.  192 Chapter 6 Create and Edit   Saving a New Movie  Once  we  have  created  a  movie  in  the  QuickTime  Control,  by  whatever means, it is instructive to review our options for saving the new movie to a ﬁle. Essentially we have three choices:   cid:2  Save  the  Movie.  Calling  the  movie’s  Save  method  and  passing  a  file name will indeed create a new movie file. If we open this file in Quick- Time  Player  for  a  quick  check,  it  will  appear  and  play  exactly  as  we would expect, with everything in place. A glance at the size of the file on disk,  though,  might  cause  some  disquiet:  it  is  likely  to  be  unusually small—perhaps  only  several  tens  of  kilobytes—and  nowhere  near  what we  might  expect  it  to  be,  given  all  the  movie  clips  or  images  we  were under the impression we stuffed into it. Here’s the explanation: when the contents of our new movie originated in other files, what actually gets added to the movie is a sequence of refer- ences to the data in its original source files, rather than a copy of the data itself.  So  when  we  Save  the  movie,  only  the  data  references  get  saved. You can easily see this if you create a movie from a sequence of movies in Movie  Builder,  Save  it,  and  then  open  it  in  QuickTime  Player.  Choose Window  Show Movie Properties and select the Resources tab: you will see a list of all the original movie files from which your movie was con- structed. Close the movie, move or rename any of these original files, and then attempt to reopen it. You will be confronted with an error message stating that one or more of your movie’s resource files cannot be located. If we know that our original source files are going to stay where they are, movies containing just references can be a very efficient means of pulling together  content  from  various  sources  without  the  overhead  of  actually having  to  copy  large  chunks  of  data.  But,  more  often  than  not,  this  is decidedly not the way in which we want to save our new movie, which brings us to the other two options.   cid:2  Save the Movie as Self-Contained. If we want to be certain that all the data resources required by our new movie are indeed stored in the movie itself, then we should call SaveSelfContained rather than Save. This will copy all of the data from the various original sources into the new file so that the movie has no dependencies, but it doesn’t do anything with that data, leaving it in its original format without any recompression. While nowhere near as quick as Save, SaveSelfContained can still be quite effi- cient since all it really has to do is to bulk-copy data from all the source  Saving a New Movie 193   files into the new movie file. The resulting movie, however, couldn’t be considered in particularly good shape when it comes to efficient playback, since its data is not optimized in any way.   cid:2  Export  the  Movie.  As  we’ve  seen  in  previous  chapters,  exporting  the movie involves handing the movie over to a QTExporter object, which will recompress  the  movie  data  in  the  desired  format,  optimizing  it  for  effi- cient playback and space utilization. While often time-consuming, espe- cially with the most efficient codecs, this really is the only option for the final stage in your production workflow.  Summary  Hopefully, this chapter has opened up a window on all the possibilities for using the QuickTime Control in a production environment. You should now be  familiar  with  the  movie  creation  methods  of  the  QuickTime  Control, together with the various editing methods of the QTMovie object, that make all this possible. Using these capabilities effectively in the .NET and COM environments requires a range of techniques that we have explored concep- tually  and  then  implemented  in  working  code  samples.  The  use  of  SMIL introduces another dimension to the whole business of assembling and syn- chronizing content and has a very useful role to play in certain aspects of content production. If your workﬂow is likely to require the regular creation of QuickTime content on Windows, you stand to gain a lot by familiarizing yourself with what can be achieved using the QuickTime Control in combi- nation with a few scripts.  194 Chapter 6 Create and Edit                                 7  7  Browsing the Media Design and Build a Complete QuickTime Application  For the Birds  If  you  were  a  nineteenth-century  ornithologist  and  wanted  to  identify  an unfamiliar bird, you generally had to be a pretty good shot—the standard of binoculars and telescopes was then just so poor. In fact, pick any leading Vic- torian  ornithologist  and  you’ll  ﬁnd  that  he   yes,  invariably     was  quite handy  with  the  riﬂe.  Nowadays,  as  with  big-game  hunters,  the  riﬂe-toting birdwatcher is thankfully a fading memory, only to be replaced by an army of recreational birders wielding nothing more harmful than the latest bins, ’scopes,  digital  cameras,  DV  cameras,  motorized  lenses,  PDAs,  and  digital sound gear, not to mention the obligatory designer birding jacket and pants. Well, at least the wee birds don’t get hurt anymore, although sometimes I wonder what they make of it all.  he  When this lot come home, they no longer worry about how to keep the cat away from their catch before they get down to the taxidermist. Instead, they are faced with a whole new set of concerns: how to identify, label, and orga- nize the hundreds of digital images, movie clips, sound clips, and ﬁeld notes that  comprise  the  ‘catch.’  The  digital  photography  of  birds  has  become  so   has  evolved popular  that  an  entire  new  subculture  known  as  around the activity of taking pictures with a digital camera stuck on the end of a telescope!  digiscoping  In fact, come to think of it, birds have to be the perfect subject for the new digital media collector: they form photogenic subjects for stills, unlike coins,  for  example;  their  ﬂight  and  other  movements  make  for  stunning video sequences, unlike stamps; and, unlike trains, their evocative songs and calls just have to be captured on disk. And they generally don’t bite.  195                                   In this chapter we are going to work through the development of a basic media browser application for a digital media collection such as this, using Visual  Basic  .NET  and  QuickTime.  Rather  than  just  hacking  the  sample together, we deliberately pay close attention to the design process. If you’re relatively  new  to  object-oriented  programming,  you  should  learn  a  little about  the  essential  design  process  involved  and  how  your  own  real-world projects will beneﬁt from the application of sound design methodology. In the process, of course, we learn more about how the QuickTime Control can best be deployed in the object-oriented environment.  Design Decisions  Before launching straight into the fun bit—coding—most seasoned develop- ers  have  learned  to  give  in  to  their  pangs  of  conscience  and  spend  a  little time  beforehand  considering  functionality  and  design.  Whatever  software design paradigm you happen to subscribe to, it’s hard to beat having some notion of what you plan to do before you start, even if the design process turns  out  to  be  highly  iterative.  Since  we  are  using  .NET,  this  inevitably means some object-oriented thinking. One of the most convincing beneﬁts of the  object-oriented  programming   OOP   approach  is  the  close  synergy between the functionality and the software implementation of that function- ality. Once you have worked out the various things your application needs to do, the objects that you need to implement these functions tend to fall quite naturally out of the process. And if they don’t, you should probably worry about whether you really understand the problem in the ﬁrst place.  The Objects  So, putting on our object-oriented thinking caps, what functionality will we require of our media browser and what objects will we need to implement it? First of all, assuming our collection of media ﬁles is organized in some kind of logical folder structure, we will need a folder or directory navigator so  that  we  can  ﬁnd  our  way  around  the  collection:  a  DirectoryNavigator object. Think the left-hand panel of Windows Explorer.  Now that we have a DirectoryNavigator to locate a folder of interest, we will want something like the right-hand panel of Windows Explorer in which to  view  the  media  ﬁles  in  that  folder;  let’s  call  this  our  MediaDisplayPanel object. Of course, we could just list the names of all the media ﬁles in this panel, but that wouldn’t exactly be mind-blowing. No, this is where Quick- Time comes in: we’ll have QuickTime open each of the media ﬁles in the  196  Chapter 7   Browsing the Media                                                   folder, if it can, and display the contents of that ﬁle, together with a few tid- bits of useful information about the ﬁle. Recalling the sheer variety of media ﬁle types that QuickTime can open, you can begin to visualize the outcome. If you’re thinking slightly ahead of me at this point, you will already have realized  that  the  MediaDisplayPanel  will  have  to  contain  a  collection  of QuickTime Controls as child objects—one for each media ﬁle in the folder. The good news is that you’re right; and the bad news? Well, you’ve fallen into  the  all-too-frequent  trap  of  jumping  to    decisions  too early. For now, forget you know that such a thing as a QuickTime Control  say at this point is exists, and let’s stick with high-level design.

In need some kind of overall container object: let’s call this  addition to hosting the various objects we’ve just discussed, this container object must also provide some of the essentials of any application such as a menu bar and workspace.  MediaBrowser  Visualizing the Design  A  propelling  pencil  is  arguably  one  of  the  more  essential  tools  in  the object-oriented  designer’s  toolbox.  In  conjunction  with  the  back  of  a  busi- ness card, beer mat, airplane sick bag, or, if all else fails, a clean sheet of white paper, you have a sophisticated visual design tool at your disposal. Use it! Visualizing the objects in our simple application so far, we can sketch a diagram like that shown in Figure 7.1.  The various objects that we’ve identiﬁed so far comprise the core func- tionality of our Media Browser, but they clearly can’t stand on their own. It is the relationships and connections   the objects that really make our application tick. In common with most GUI applications, our Media Browser is predominantly event-driven.  between  This is where the visual sketch comes into its own: we can now begin to identify  and  add  in  the  various  events  that  will  drive  our  application,  as shown in Figure 7.2 and detailed in companion Table 7.1.

When a MediaViewer is  selected, this event tells the  MediaInspector to load a  fresh set of data from the  newly selected viewer. When the application is  resized, this event tells the  DirectoryNavigator and  MediaDisplayPanel to  resize themselves. The  MediaDisplayPanel should  then reorganize its  collection of MediaViewers.  In  summary,  we’ve  now  identiﬁed  the  core  functional  objects  in  our application and the key connections between those objects. Note that we very  deliberately  haven’t  yet  talked  much  about  user  interface   UI ,  nor have  we  discussed  any  implementation  details  of  the  objects  themselves. The  object-based  application  that  we  have  designed  could  in  fact,  at  this stage,  be  implemented  in  any  of  a  whole  variety  of  different  OOP  lan- guages  and  frameworks:  C++,  Java,  Visual  Basic,  C,  Qt,  REALbasic,  to mention but a few.

Picking the Components  A core feature of the .NET Framework is  —a rather unimagi- native name for what turns out to be quite a comprehensive and useful col- lection of reusable standard UI objects. We begin our implementation design by  looking  carefully  at  each  of  our  objects  in  turn  and,  where  possible, selecting UI objects from Windows Forms upon which to base each object.  Windows Forms   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Panel  TreeView  MediaViewers  System.Windows.Forms.TreeView  DirectoryNavigator .  Since  any  directory  structure  is  essentially  a  tree structure, we must look for some kind of tree-view control that will allow us to display and navigate the structure. A tree-view is a very common UI requirement and it’s not surprising to find the necessary class in Windows Forms known simply as  . Unfortunately, the   class out of the box is not smart enough to build itself from a directory structure, so some additional coding will be required. MediaDisplayPanel .

We live in the real world, so let’s just assume for now that we’ve only a vague idea what we might wish for here and postpone implementation decisions until later.  Now we can revisit our object diagram and ﬁll in the names of the Win- dows Forms classes that we plan to use in the implementation of each object, as shown in Figure 7.3.  Having gone through this exercise, it should be apparent how much of the boilerplate functionality of our simple application the .NET Framework con- veniently provides. Instead of wasting time reinventing basic UI elements, we can get on with wiring the .NET objects together and writing our own application code.   Building the Bare Bones  Rapid  Even  in  a  supposedly    Application  Development   RAD   environment such as Visual Basic .NET, assembling the bare bones of an application from scratch  is  always  tedious.  If  you’re  like  me,  you  invariably  spend  a  while rooting through previous projects or samples looking for a starting point— anything to avoid File  New  Project.  Implementation  201                                                                                          To get started with this project, download the   MediaBrowserVB BareBones  project from  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples    in  the   Just  open   MediaBrowserVB.sln    folder.  Start  it   F5 ,  and you’ll  be  pleased  to  discover  that  I’ve  saved  you  the  trouble.

In this case I’ve opted to give the form a handcrafted code in the   component menu bar in design mode and I’ve dropped a  on the form for later use. All the other setup code is in the   rou-  FolderBrowserDialog  InitializeMe  New  Figure 7.4  Bare-bones Media Browser.  202  Chapter 7   Browsing the Media                            tine that gets called at the end of  the autogenerated code from design mode. In  we create and initialize the two principal child objects that will ﬁll our form:   has executed  you can see how  InitializeComponent  InitializeMe  , after   New  'Create a DirectoryNavigator m_directoryNavigator = New DirectoryNavigator m_directoryNavigator.Parent = Me m_directoryNavigator.Dock = DockStyle.Left  'Create RHS display Panel m_mediaDisplayPanel = New MediaDisplayPanel m_mediaDisplayPanel.Parent = Me m_mediaDisplayPanel.Dock = DockStyle.Fill 'Fills remainder of window m_mediaDisplayPanel.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.White m_mediaDisplayPanel.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.Fixed3D m_mediaDisplayPanel.AutoScroll = True m_mediaDisplayPanel.SetAutoScrollMargin 15, 15   Notice how the Dock property of both child objects is used to park the Direc- toryNavigator on the Left and to allow the MediaDisplayPanel to Fill the rest of the available space. Setting AutoScroll = True for the MediaDisplay- Panel  immediately  gives  us  all  the  beneﬁts  of  a  managed  scrolling  region, which  we  will  come  to  appreciate  later.  The  addition  of  a Splitter  object between the two panels and a StatusBar at the bottom completes the initial layout of our form.  Before ﬁring up our bare-bones application for the ﬁrst time, let’s take a quick  look  at  the  start-up  code.  While  it  might  seem  sensible  to  just  have MainForm as the start-up object for our project, I’ve elected instead to use a Main subroutine in a separate module—MediaBrowser—as the entry point for our application. This has several advantages:   cid:2  We have a chance to carry out some initial checks before we attempt to load  the  main  form.  For  example,  we  could  check  for  the  presence  of QuickTime.   cid:2  Wrapping  the  loading  of  our  MainForm  with  a  Try...Catch  construct allows  us  to  gracefully  handle  any  unexpected  application  errors  that might occur anywhere in our application, since an exception will bubble up from wherever it was raised until it is eventually trapped here if not caught beforehand.   cid:2  It is often useful to load application configuration information as early as possible, since some of the application settings may well determine what happens during the subsequent start-up phase.  Implementation  203   Every nontrivial application should have a conﬁguration ﬁle of some sort, where  settings  and  preferences  can  be  stored  and  in  this  case,  it’s Media- Browser.ini:  [Settings] RootPath=E:\Book\Data\Species FileExtensions=jpg,bmp,gif,tif,png  [MediaDisplayPanel] MarginWidth=15 ViewerWidth=128 ViewerHeight=96 ViewerSpacing=10  Sub Main   creates an instance of the IniFile class for reading and writ- ing INI ﬁles and initializes it with the name of the INI ﬁle. Since the refer- ence  to  our  IniFile  object,  g_IniSettings,  is  declared  Public  within  a module, it is available globally to other objects in the application—debatably one  of  the  few  legitimate  uses  for  a  global  variable  in  an  object-oriented application.  The MainForm menu events are wired up to Exit the application, to Open a new root folder, and to show the About dialog. The handy AboutForm class was borrowed from one of the .NET samples: it conveniently populates itself with information from its parent form and from the application assembly.  Press F5 and we have a great starting point for building the real meat of our application. Try dragging the splitter bar or resizing the main form and you’ll recognize how much functionality we’ve essentially gotten “for free” from the .NET Framework and for very little effort.  Before  moving  on,  I  suggest  you  move  to  the  MediaBrowserVB WorkIn-  Progress version of this project available from  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples  Directory Browsing  Our DirectoryNavigator class subclasses the Windows Forms TreeView con- trol. Unfortunately, that really hasn’t gotten us very far. In order to graphi- cally represent our folder structure, we will ﬁnally have to give in and resort to some serious coding to turn our TreeView into a DirectoryNavigator.  204 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   A  TreeView  object  is  made  up  of  a  hierarchical  set  of TreeNode  objects, where each TreeNode represents a named branch of the tree and may in turn have its own child nodes—ideally suited to graphically representing a direc- tory structure. So populating our TreeView requires a straightforward walk through the directory tree structure within our root directory:  1. Add a TreeNode for the current directory. 2. Add a child TreeNode for each subdirectory to the node we just created. 3. Open each subdirectory, go back to step 1, and keep repeating this process until we end up at the leaves of the tree; that is, until we run out of sub- directories.  Many of you will instantly note the scope for recursion, but before look- ing at how we might implement this algorithm, let’s start by conﬁguring our DirectoryNavigator class. Each TreeNode can be assigned a label and a pair of images in its constructor. The images are set using indexes into an Image- List, which we set up in the New   routine of the DirectoryNavigator with one image to represent a closed folder and another for the open folder:  Me.ImageList = New ImageList With Me.ImageList.Images   .Add New Bitmap "..\Images\FolderClosed.bmp"     .Add New Bitmap "..\Images\FolderOpen.bmp"   End With  Referring back to our design sketches, we can see that the DirectoryNavi- gator must respond to a SelectRootDirectory event by loading a new direc- tory  structure,  and  so  we  give  it  a  Load  method  that  takes  an  optional rootPath parameter.  Public Sub Load Optional ByVal rootPath As String = ""     BeginUpdate      'Prevent repainting flicker while we add nodes    Nodes.Clear      'Build root nodes of tree   If rootPath   "" Then     Dim tnRootPath As New TreeNode rootPath, 0, 1      Nodes.Add tnRootPath      AddDirectories tnRootPath   Implementation 205       'Expand root node     tnRootPath.Expand     Else     'No root path so make disk drives the root nodes     Dim diskDrives As String   = Directory.GetLogicalDrives        Dim drv As String     For Each drv In diskDrives       Dim tnDrive As New TreeNode drv, 0, 1        Nodes.Add tnDrive        AddDirectories tnDrive      Next    End If    EndUpdate    End Sub  If  the  rootPath  parameter  is  present,  then  we  create  a  new  TreeNode object, give it the name rootPath, and add our new node to the Nodes collec- tion of the TreeView. If no rootPath was passed in, we gather up a list of all the disk drives and add a new node for each to the Nodes collection.  But the real magic here is in AddDirectories, which simply takes a node representing a directory, obtains a list of all its subdirectories, and adds child nodes for each one:  Sub AddDirectories ByVal tn As TreeNode     Dim di As DirectoryInfo   Dim dirs   As DirectoryInfo    tn.Nodes.Clear      di = New DirectoryInfo tn.FullPath     Try     'Get array of all subdirectories     dirs = di.GetDirectories    206 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media     Catch exp As Exception     Exit Sub   End Try    For Each di In dirs      'Create a child node for every subdirectory, passing in     'the directory name and the images its node will use     Dim tnDir As New TreeNode di.Name, 0, 1       ' Add the new child node to the parent node     tn.Nodes.Add tnDir       AddDirectories tnDir     Next End Sub  Note use of tn.FullPath: the FullPath property of a TreeNode returns a delimited string of the labels of all the nodes in the complete path from its root  node.  Since  we  label  our  nodes  with  the  name  of  the  corresponding directory, and since the default delimiter or PathSeparator is a backslash  \ , FullPath  effectively  returns  just  that—a  full  path  to  the  directory  repre- sented by the node.  Intriguingly, AddDirectories calls itself for each of the new nodes it has added. This is known as a recursive call and makes for a very elegant solu- tion: a single call to AddDirectories in the Load routine populates our entire DirectoryNavigator! Sadly, while it’s certainly elegant, it’s not really a lot of use in practice. Imagine calling  Load "c:\"   You  might  have  time  for  a  quick  coffee  while  AddDirectories  churns recursively through every folder on your drive adding thousands of nodes as it goes! So, sadly, the neat recursive bit gets commented out.  Thinking about it, however, it’s obvious that we only really need to add nodes to our tree on demand whenever the user chooses to open a folder by expanding its node. And sure enough, TreeView has an OnBeforeExpand event  Implementation 207   that is just the ticket. We override this to call AddDirectories on demand for each child node of the node that the user has chosen to expand:  Protected Overrides Sub OnBeforeExpand              ByVal tvcea As TreeViewCancelEventArgs     MyBase.OnBeforeExpand tvcea     BeginUpdate      'Prevent repainting flicker while we add nodes    Dim tn As TreeNode    'Add child nodes for each child node in the expanded   For Each tn In tvcea.Node.Nodes     AddDirectories tn    Next tn    EndUpdate    End Sub  Media Display  Now  that  we  can  use  our  DirectoryNavigator  to  select  a  folder  of  media ﬁles, let’s move on to the MediaDisplayPanel that is going to provide us with a view of those ﬁles.  During  the  design  discussion,  I  mentioned  that  the  MediaDisplayPanel would manage a collection of MediaViewer objects: one for each media ﬁle in the selected folder. So, clearly, it will need methods to   cid:2  Load the MediaViewer objects from a directory in response to a Directory-  Select event from the DirectoryNavigator.   cid:2  Lay out the MediaViewer objects within the available space on the Media-  DisplayPanel.  Let’s  look  at  the  Load  subroutine.  Having  unloaded  any  existing Media- Viewer instances and switched the cursor to an hourglass—this could take a while—we  get  a  list  of  all  the  ﬁles  in  the  directory  that  was  passed  as  a parameter to Load:  208 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   Public Sub Load ByVal dir As String     'Save directory path   m_directoryPath = dir    'Clear any existing media viewers   Unload      Cursor.Current = Cursors.WaitCursor 'This might take some time    Dim di As New DirectoryInfo m_directoryPath    Dim myFiles   As FileInfo    'Get an array of all files in the directory   Try     myFiles = di.GetFiles "*.*"    Catch     MessageBox.Show "Unable to get list of files from folder:" &             vbCrLf & vbCrLf & m_directoryPath, "Error"      Cursor.Current = Cursors.Default     Return   End Try    ...  End Sub  The error trap here is useful in case for some reason our directory has gone away,  for  example,  the  DVD-ROM  was  ejected  or  a  network  share  disap- peared.  Now, while QuickTime is pretty adept at working out whether it can or cannot open a particular ﬁle, we may prefer a little more control over this. For example, confronted with a text ﬁle, QuickTime will quite happily make a movie out of it containing a text track with one frame per line in the ﬁle. However, reading text ﬁles with the aid of a movie controller isn’t exactly pleasurable, so maybe we’d like a means of limiting the kinds of ﬁles that our  Media  Browser  can  open  to  certain  types,  such  as  MP3  ﬁles  or  Flash movies.  For  this  purpose  I’ve  added  a  FileExtensions  setting  in  Media- Browser.ini that contains a list of all the ﬁle extensions we would like to be able to browse. For example  Implementation 209   FileExtensions=jpg,bmp,avi,pic,mov,dv,gif,tif,png,wav,aif,mpg,             mp3,mp4,swf,m4a,m4p  This comma-delimited list of extensions is loaded from the INI ﬁle in the Form1_Load routine of MainForm, split into an array of strings, and passed to the MediaDisplayPanel by calling its SetExtensions method:  Private Sub Form1_Load ByVal sender As System.Object, _             ByVal e As System.EventArgs  Handles MyBase.Load    Dim exts   As String    exts = LCase g_IniSettings.GetSetting "Settings",              "FileExtensions", "jpg,mov"  .Split CType ",", Char      'Set qualifying file extensions   m_mediaDisplayPanel.SetExtensions exts     ...  End Sub  SetExtensions takes the array of strings and converts it into a StringCol-  lection held in the m_extensionsCollection member variable:  Public Sub SetExtensions ByVal exts   As String    m_extensionsCollection = New StringCollection   m_extensionsCollection.AddRange exts  End Sub  Back  in  our  Load  routine,  as  we  can  see  in  the  following  listing,  all  we have to do is loop through the list of ﬁles we have obtained from the folder, ﬁltering  out  any  that  don’t  have  extensions  in  our  list  and  creating  new MediaViewer objects one by one to load the ﬁles that we do want to view.  Dim di As New DirectoryInfo m_directoryPath  Dim myFiles   As FileInfo  'Get an array of all files in the directory  210 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   Try   myFiles = di.GetFiles "*.*"  Catch   MessageBox.Show "Unable to get list of files from folder:" +              vbCrLf + vbCrLf + m_directoryPath, "Error"    Cursor.Current = Cursors.Default   Return End Try  'Load the media viewers one at a time Dim fi As FileInfo Dim ext As String Dim mv As MediaViewer For Each fi In myFiles    ext = LCase Mid fi.Extension, 2    'Strip period: ".JPG" -> "jpg"    'Check if file extension in extensions collection   If m_extensionsCollection.Contains ext  Then      'Create new media viewer     Try       mv = New MediaViewer        'Configure media viewer       mv.Parent = Me       mv.Visible = False  'Keep hidden until after we position later       mv.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.FixedSingle       mv.Size = m_sizeViewer        mv.Load fi.FullName         'Add media viewer to controls collection of MediaDisplayPanel       Controls.Add mv       Catch e As Exception        Dim errMsg As String = "Unable to load media viewer: "       errMsg += "[" + fi.FullName + "]"       errMsg += vbCrLf + e.Message  Implementation 211         Debug.WriteLine errMsg         'Dispose of media viewer - we won't be needing it       mv.Dispose         mv = Nothing      End Try    End If  Next fi  Once each MediaViewer is created and loaded, we add it to the Controls col- lection of the MediaDisplayPanel. If an exception occurs while attempting to load a MediaViewer—the ﬁle might be corrupt—we log the error and dispose of the MediaViewer.  Media Viewer  Up to this point we haven’t said a whole lot about the MediaViewer class that we  have  been  so  merrily  creating  instances  of.  What  precisely  is  a Media- Viewer, and what is the code in the preceding Load routine actually doing?  Well, our MediaViewer class actually subclasses the QuickTime Control—it  inherits all of its properties and methods:  Public Class MediaViewer     Inherits AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl  Why not just use the QuickTime Control as is instead of going to all this trouble?  The  answer  is  that,  in  line  with  good  OOP  practice,  we  want  to wrap a layer of abstraction around the implementation details of the Media- Viewer. The MediaDisplayPanel should not need to be overly concerned with the precise semantics of the QuickTime Control. Rather, it should be able to deal  with  a  more  abstract  MediaViewer  class  with  a  well-deﬁned  interface speciﬁc to its own needs.  This approach has several advantages:   cid:2  Should  a  new  or  updated  QuickTime  Control  come  on  the  scene,  any changes  we  may  find  necessary  are  likely  to  be  confined  to  the  private code of our MediaViewer class.  212 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media    cid:2  If we opted to replace the QuickTime Control with some other media con- trol, it is conceivable that we could create a drop-in replacement for our MediaViewer control.  Encapsulation vs. Inheritance  While subclassing allows us to inherit all the functionality and interfaces of the QuickTime Control,  and  to  extend  it,  it  does  not  provide  any  real  degree  of  information-hiding  or encapsulation. Encapsulation means literally putting something “inside a shell” and is one of the pillars of object-oriented design. If our MediaViewer were to encapsulate the Quick- Time Control, instead of inheriting the QuickTime Control class, it would create its own private instance of the control through a private member variable.  'Subclass Inheritance Public Class MediaViewer   Inherits AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl End Class  'Encapsulation Public Class MediaViewer   Private m_qtControl as AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl      Sub New         m_qtControl = New AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl     End Sub End Class  None of the control’s interface would be exposed, and all access would be through the public MediaViewer interface. Any class using MediaViewer would be dealing with a black box. While this degree of abstraction has some clear advantages, it does add an additional layer of complexity, since additional code has to be added to MediaViewer to access the encapsulated control.  Since, at this stage, we are more concerned with how our MediaDisplay- Panel  class  loads  and  positions  MediaViewer  objects  than  with  the  Media- Viewer itself, let’s take advantage of the layer of abstraction we’ve allowed ourselves. Instead of having the MediaViewer subclass the QuickTime Con- trol, let’s forget about QuickTime for now and make our life a little simpler by having MediaViewer subclass a PictureBox, the Windows Forms class for displaying images:  Public Class MediaViewer   Inherits PictureBox  Implementation 213   Once  we  have  everything  working  the  way  we  want  it  with  a Picture- Box-based MediaViewer, we’ll see how easy it is to switch the base class of the MediaViewer back to the QuickTime Control class. Here’s our starter Media- Viewer class:  Public Class MediaViewer   Inherits PictureBox    Private m_loadedFileName As String    Public ReadOnly Property LoadedFileName   As String     Get       Return m_loadedFileName     End Get   End Property    Public Sub Load ByVal fileName As String       m_loadedFileName = fileName      If fileName = "" Then       Image = Nothing     Else       Image = Image.FromFile fileName        SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.StretchImage     End If    End Sub    'Unload viewer   Public Sub Unload        m_loadedFileName = ""     Image = Nothing    End Sub  End Class  214 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   Notice that we have given the MediaViewer both Load and Unload methods together with a LoadedFileName property. These simple additions allow us to disguise  the  fact  that  we  are  working  with  a PictureBox.  Later,  when  we switch MediaViewer to inherit the QuickTime Control class, we’ll retain this interface so as not to disrupt the client  MediaDisplayPanel , even though the implementation of the methods will of course change.  Keeping the Viewers in Order  Having loaded a MediaViewer for each media ﬁle of interest in the selected directory, we turn our attention to the problem of how to lay out our collec- tion  of  MediaViewer  objects.  Given  that  the  media  ﬁles,  or  at  least  those with a visual representation such as movies or images, are likely to come in a variety of different sizes and aspect ratios, it probably makes sense to use a ﬁxed-size MediaViewer and to scale the media display accordingly. For our simple PictureBox-based MediaViewer, the following line does the trick by ensuring that the image loaded into the PictureBox is stretched to ﬁt the control.  SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.StretchImage  Later,  when  we  introduce  the  QuickTime  Control,  we’ll  get  more  fussy about exactly how we control the scaling.  After each MediaViewer is created in the MediaDisplayPanel.Load routine,  it is ﬁrst hidden and then sized and given a single-pixel border:  mv.Parent = Me mv.Visible = False  'Keep hidden until after we position later mv.Size = m_sizeViewer mv.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.FixedSingle  The member variable m_sizeViewer holds the required viewer size and is set through the MediaDisplayPanel.ViewerSize property. This is one of several layout settings that are read from the INI ﬁle in MainForm.Form1_Load.  The  MediaDisplayPanel.PositionMediaViewers  routine  has  the  rather unenviable task of having to impose some spatial order on our collection of MediaViewer  objects,  such  as  arranging  them  neatly  in  a  grid.  We  decreed earlier that they should all be the same size, so this makes the task a little easier. Here are the parameters we have to work with:   cid:2  MediaDisplayPanel width and height  cid:2  MediaViewer width and height  m_sizeViewer   Implementation 215    cid:2  Margin width, or distance between edge of panel and viewers  m_margin-  Width    cid:2  Viewer spacing, or distance between adjacent viewers  m_viewerSpacing   cid:2  Number of MediaViewers  Pencil and paper come to the rescue here once again. Correctly visualiz- ing this sort of problem is usually half the battle won, as can be seen in Fig- ure 7.5.  Start with the assumption that that if we have too many viewers to display in the available space, we would rather they scrolled vertically—a bit like a long web page. Fortunately, the scrolling is taken care of for us since, as you will  recall,  MediaDisplayPanel  inherits  from  Panel,  which  in  turn  inherits from ScrollableControl. But that still leaves us with the task of positioning the controls in a grid.To achieve this we ﬁrst need to work out the maximum  MediaDisplayPanel  m_marginWidth  m_marginWidth  m_viewerSpacing  m_sizeViewer.Width  m_sizeViewer.Height  Height  Figure 7.5 Parameters involved in positioning MediaViewers on the MediaDisplayPanel.  Width  216 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   number of viewers that will ﬁt across a single row in the available width, taking into account the desired margin and spacing:  'How many columns can we fit in available width? nMaxCols = CInt Math.Floor  Width -  m_marginWidth * 2                   m_sizeViewer.Width + m_viewerSpacing     Math.Floor ensures that we obtain the largest whole number of viewers that will ﬁt; were we to use CInt on its own, it would be as likely to round up as down, leading us to believe that 4 viewers might ﬁt where there is really only room for 3.8.  Now that we’ve ﬁgured out the number of columns, we can loop through our viewers collection and line them all up in a grid. Since our MediaDis- playPanel has no other child objects in it, we can safely assume that its Con- trols collection is synonymous with the collection of viewers.  'Position all the media viewers in a grid within the available space Sub PositionMediaViewers      Dim nMaxCols As Integer, nCenterHOffset As Integer    If Controls.Count = 0 Then Exit Sub    'How many columns can we fit in available width?   nMaxCols = CInt Math.Floor  Width -  m_marginWidth * 2                   m_sizeViewer.Width + m_viewerSpacing       'Position the media viewers   Dim ctl As Control   Dim locn As New Point   Dim nCol As Integer, nRow As Integer    nCol = 0 : nRow = 0   For Each ctl In Controls      If  nCol >= nMaxCols  Then       nRow += 1 'New row       nCol = 0     End If  Implementation 217       locn.X = m_marginWidth +               nCol *  m_sizeViewer.Width + m_viewerSpacing       locn.Y = m_marginWidth +               nRow *  m_sizeViewer.Height + m_viewerSpacing        ctl.Location = locn     ctl.Visible = True   'Show viewer      nCol = nCol + 1    Next ctl  End Sub  The logic here should be self-explanatory, but notice how we make each viewer visible after we position it using its Location property. By hiding the viewers on creation and only making them visible once we have positioned them, we ensure an orderly screen update. Of course, we could be a little smarter and precompute nMaxCols before loading our viewers, working out the position of each viewer as we create it and allowing it to pop into place immediately—an exercise for the reader!  Resizing MainForm or even dragging the splitter bar has the effect of resiz- ing our MediaDisplayPanel. We want to be informed when this happens so that we can call our PositionMediaViewers routine to do its thing. The best way to do this is to override the MediaDisplayPanel’s Resize event handler, making sure to call the base handler:  'Overrides Resize event handler to reposition viewers Protected Overrides Sub OnResize ByVal e As EventArgs     PositionMediaViewers      MyBase.OnResize e   End Sub  Wiring Up the Connections  You will recall from our earlier design discussion that this application is very much event-driven. Now is the time to take the various objects that we’ve cre- ated and connect them to each other so that they begin to work together.  218 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   Where better to start than with File  Open Folder... on our main menu, which allows the user to pick a root folder from which the DirectoryNaviga- tor  is  populated.  Selecting  this  menu  item  raises  the  menu’s Click  event, thus our code to respond to it must go inside the mnuOpen_Click event han- dler of MainForm. When you present your user with a ﬁle folder open dialog, it’s only courteous to ensure that the starting point for browsing is the cur- rent working ﬁle or folder. And so ﬁrst we retrieve the RootPath setting from our INI ﬁle and use it to preconﬁgure the FolderBrowserDialog component, which you will recall we placed on MainForm in design mode:  'Start with current root folder Dim currentRootFolder As String =              g_IniSettings.GetSetting "Settings", "RootPath", ""   If currentRootFolder   "" Then              folderBrowserDialog1.SelectedPath = currentRootFolder  ShowDialog  presents  the  user  with  a  standard  Windows  folder  browser from which a new root folder can be selected. Once chosen, the new folder path  is  saved  straight  back  out  to  the  INI  ﬁle  before  we  call Load  on  our DirectoryNavigator object:  'Browse for new root folder If folderBrowserDialog1.ShowDialog   = DialogResult.OK Then    'Save new root folder   g_IniSettings.SetSetting "Settings", "RootPath",              folderBrowserDialog1.SelectedPath       'Load directory tree from root folder   m_directoryNavigator.Load folderBrowserDialog1.SelectedPath     End If  And so with just a few lines of event handling code, we’ve succeeded in connecting our File  Open Folder... menu to our DirectoryNavigator object. The next signiﬁcant event occurs whenever the user selects a directory in the DirectoryNavigator. Glancing back at our design sketches, we can see that this event has to be wired to our MediaDisplayPanel object. The only problem is that our DirectoryNavigator object is blissfully unaware of the  Implementation 219   existence of the MediaDisplayPanel and vice versa! And, in a sense, this is exactly as it should be in a proper object-oriented system: neither of these objects  needs  the  other  to  accomplish  its  own  particular  function  so  why introduce unnecessary dependencies?  The real responsibility for connecting these two objects falls upon Main- Form, their shared parent object. Since our DirectoryNavigator inherits from the TreeView control, it will emit an AfterSelect event whenever a directory is selected. All we have to do is add a handler for this event to MainForm after we create the DirectoryNavigator instance:  'Create a DirectoryNavigator instance m_directoryNavigator = New DirectoryNavigator m_directoryNavigator.Parent = Me m_directoryNavigator.Dock = DockStyle.Left  'Add an AfterSelect event handler AddHandler m_directoryNavigator.AfterSelect,              AddressOf DirectoryNavigatorOnAfterSelect  Our event handler routine then does nothing more than extract the full path  to  the  selected  directory  from  the  selected  node  and  call  the  Load method of our MediaDisplayPanel:  'Handles the AfterSelect event for the DirectoryNavigator Private Sub DirectoryNavigatorOnAfterSelect ByVal obj As Object,              ByVal tvea As TreeViewEventArgs     'Load media display panel from directory   m_mediaDisplayPanel.Load tvea.Node.FullPath   End Sub  This indirect linkage between the between DirectoryNavigator and Media- DisplayPanel is illustrated in Figure 7.6.  And with that, we should have a fully functional Image Browser based on a  PictureBox,  as  shown  in  Figure  7.7.  Check  it  out  by  navigating  to  any folder that contains JPEG, GIF, or BMP images. Now is a good chance to do some testing and to add in any functional tweaks we might wish for before we ditch the PictureBox in favor of a much more serious piece of kit.  220 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   MainForm  DirectoryNavigator  MediaDisplayPanel  Load  AfterSelect  DirectoryNavigatorOnAfterSelect  Figure 7.6 Indirect link between DirectoryNavigator and MediaDisplayPanel.  Adding the QuickTime Control  Having  elected  earlier  to  wrap  our  media  control  with  a MediaViewer  class, switching from a PictureBox-based implementation to a QuickTime Control– based viewer should be a matter of changing  Public Class MediaViewer   Inherits PictureBox  to  Public Class MediaViewer   Inherits AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl  not forgetting, of course, to add the necessary reference to the QuickTime Control to our project—as we learned in Chapter 2—and making some alter- ations to the MediaViewer.Load routine.  Implementation 221   Figure 7.7 Image Browser based on PictureBox control.  In  practice,  it  is  a  little  more  complicated  than  this,  but  not  very  much  more. Here’s our new MediaViewer class:  Public Class MediaViewer   Inherits AxQTOControlLib.AxQTControl    Private m_loadedFileName As String   Private m_loadErrorCode As Integer    Public ReadOnly Property LoadedFileName   As String     Get       Return m_loadedFileName     End Get   End Property  222 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media     Public ReadOnly Property LoadErrorCode   As Integer     Get       Return m_loadErrorCode     End Get   End Property    'Load viewer from a file   Public Sub Load ByVal fName As String       Me.ErrorHandling =              QTErrorHandlingOptionsEnum.qtErrorHandlingRaiseException     Me.Sizing =              QTSizingModeEnum.qtMovieFitsControlMaintainAspectRatio      Me.MovieControllerVisible = True      Try       Me.URL = fName       m_loadedFileName = fName       m_loadErrorCode = 0        If Microsoft.VisualBasic.Left Me.Movie.MIMEType, 5  =              "image" Then         Me.MovieControllerVisible = False       End If      Catch e As COMException       m_loadErrorCode = e.ErrorCode       Throw e     End Try    End Sub    'Unload viewer   Public Sub Unload        m_loadedFileName = ""     Me.URL = ""    End Sub End Class  Implementation 223   Our Load routine has been toughened up by adding an exception handler to  catch  any COMException  that  the  QuickTime  Control  might  throw  while attempting to load a ﬁle. Rather than reporting an error here, the exception handling code just saves the error code in a member variable m_loadError- Code, and then proceeds to throw the exception once again so that it can be recaught in the routine that is attempting to load the control. The LoadError- Code  property  of  MediaViewer  can  then  be  checked  to  ﬁnd  out  what  went wrong.  Setting the Sizing mode to MediaFitsControlMaintainAspectRatio ensures that the image, video, or whatever is scaled to ﬁt within the bounds of the con- trol, but in such a way as to preserve the original aspect ratio of the media. This means that there may be some white-space at top bottom or left right of the media where its aspect ratio differs from that of the control.  If a movie is loaded, we make sure it has a visible movie controller:  Me.MovieControllerVisible = True  But if an image happens to be loaded, it’s a bit pointless having a movie con- troller,  so  we’d  like  to  turn  it  off.  This  is  easier  said  than  done:  since  the QuickTime  Control  opens  an  image  as  a  single-frame  movie,  how  can  we possibly  tell  that  it’s  an  image?  This  is  where  the  MIMEType  property  of QTMovie comes in handy. The MIME content type of an image  or, more spe- ciﬁcally, of any ﬁle that is opened using a QuickTime Graphics Importer  can always be relied upon to be “image” so we can add the following after we’ve opened the ﬁle:  If Microsoft.VisualBasic.Left Me.Movie.MIMEType, 5  = "image" Then   Me.MovieControllerVisible = False End If  With these few changes we should now be able to point our Directory- Navigator at a folder of movies, images, or sound ﬁles, or even a mixture of any of the many types of media ﬁles that QuickTime can open, and watch them  pop  into  our  browser.  Of  course,  don’t  forget  to  edit  the FileExten- sions setting in your MediaBrowser.ini ﬁle to include a few more ﬁle types:  FileExtensions=jpg,bmp,avi,mov,dv,gif,tif,png,wav,aif,mpg,             mp3,mp4,m4a,m4p,swf  224 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   Media Inspector  It’s  all  very  well  being  able  to  view  and  even  play  the  media  ﬁles  we’re browsing, but that doesn’t help a whole lot if we’ve no idea what we’re look- ing at or listening to! As we learned in Chapter 5, many movies, images, and sound ﬁles contain valuable information about themselves locked up in their embedded metadata. The QTMovie class conveniently exposes this embedded data through its Annotation and Annotations properties, providing us with a uniﬁed means of obtaining metadata from many of the diverse ﬁle types that QuickTime can handle. A fuller explanation and examples can be found in Chapter 5. In addition to the metadata, QuickTime also allows us to extract lots of interesting and even not-so-interesting tidbits of information about a particular media ﬁle, such as its color depth, the codec used to compress the data, the length of a track, and the like.  If you open your movies one at a time in QuickTime Player and choose Window  Show Movie Info and Window  Show Movie Properties, you can of course ﬁnd a lot of this information, but it’s tedious and they make you work for it. What we would like for our Media Browser is a concise view of as much of this metadata as possible, preferably in a ﬂoating palette. Ideally, all we should have to do is click on a media ﬁle of interest in our browser and the palette will instantly display all the data we want. Welcome to the Media Inspector!  See Figure 7.8.   Figure 7.8 QuickTime Player Movie Info vs. Media Inspector for the same movie.  Implementation 225   Stepping back for a moment, let’s consider what functionality we require of our MediaInspector object and how best we can implement it. The ﬁrst thing that’s really kind of obvious, but still worth stating, is that it can only “inspect” one media ﬁle at a time, so clearly our MediaInspector must have a means of being told which MediaViewer to inspect.  Paying homage once more to OOP fundamentals, we should encapsulate as much functionality as possible within our MediaInspector so that its cli- ents need not concern themselves too much with what goes on inside it. Ide- ally,  all  our  application  should  have  to  do  is  create  an  instance  of  the MediaInspector,  size  and  position  it,  and  then  hand  it  a  MediaViewer  to inspect.  Property  inspectors  in  various  contemporary  applications  tend  to vary in sophistication from elaborate tree-based structures with collapsible sections to humbler lists of name-value pairs. In our case we’ll opt for the simpler name-value property list, although we will split this up into sections of related properties.  Moving on to implementation, if the MediaInspector is to be a ﬂoating pal- ette separate from our main application form, then we need to start with a stand-alone Form  MediaInspector  whose FormBorderStyle is SizableTool- Window and that will not show up in the task bar separately from our main application form. It’s just as convenient to set these properties of the form in design mode.  The  name-value  property  pairs  can  conveniently  be  presented  in  a two-column  ListView  component  that  ﬁlls  the  client  area  of  our  MediaIn- spector form, for which we declare the member variable m_lvInfo. Here’s an outline of our new two-column property inspector class:  Public Class MediaInspector   Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form    Private m_lvInfo As ListView   Private m_viewer As MediaViewer    Public Sub New       MyBase.New        'This call is required by the Windows Form Designer     InitializeComponent    226 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media       'Add any initialization after the InitializeComponent   call      'Create Info List View to fill window     m_lvInfo = New ListView     m_lvInfo.Parent = Me     m_lvInfo.Dock = DockStyle.Fill     m_lvInfo.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.None      m_lvInfo.Items.Clear       m_lvInfo.View = View.Details     m_lvInfo.GridLines = True     m_lvInfo.HeaderStyle = ColumnHeaderStyle.Nonclickable      'Add two columns     m_lvInfo.Columns.Add "Property", -2, HorizontalAlignment.Left      m_lvInfo.Columns.Add "Value", -2, HorizontalAlignment.Left       'Set Initial Size     Me.Size = New Size 350, 400     End Sub End Class  Notice that I have slipped in member variable m_viewer. This is destined to  hold  a  reference  to  the  MediaViewer  that  is  currently  under  inspection. Before we look at this in detail, though, let’s ﬁnish off the housekeeping by adding a resize handler to the inspector form:  'Handles the Resize event Private Sub MediaInspector_Resize ByVal sender As Object,              ByVal e As System.EventArgs  Handles MyBase.Resize    If IsNothing m_lvInfo  Then Exit Sub    'Resize the list view intelligently   m_lvInfo.Size = Me.ClientSize    If m_lvInfo.Columns.Count >= 2 Then     If m_lvInfo.Width < 300 Then       m_lvInfo.Columns 0 .Width = CInt m_lvInfo.Width   2        m_lvInfo.Columns 1 .Width = CInt m_lvInfo.Width   2   Implementation 227       Else       m_lvInfo.Columns 0 .Width = 150       m_lvInfo.Columns 1 .Width = m_lvInfo.Width - 150     End If   End If  End Sub  All this does is to ensure that, above a certain width, our Property column does not get any wider at the expense of the Value column where space is at a premium.  Tip Note this small but important check at the beginning of our Resize handler:  If IsNothing m_lvInfo  Then Exit Sub Without  this  check,  it’s  conceivable  that  our Resize  handler  could  be  called  before  the ListView object is created, for example, when the form is ﬁrst set to its default size, in which case referencing m_lvInfo would throw a rather scary NullReferenceException. Try commenting out this check and you’ll see what I mean!  The moral of course is to never assume that object variables invariably reference an actual object. Ruthless natural selection soon weeds out C and C++ programmers who don’t reli- giously check for null pointers, but because Visual Basic does such a masterful job of masking the concept of pointers from the casual developer, it’s easy to become careless with object references.  Now all that’s left is to write the code that actually populates the ListView in  our  MediaInspector.  The  starting  point  for  this  is  to  assign  a  particular MediaViewer to be inspected through the public SetViewer method of Media- Inspector.  Public Sub SetViewer ByRef mv As MediaViewer     If IsNothing mv  Then Exit Sub    m_viewer = mv    'Clear all existing info   m_lvInfo.Items.Clear    228 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media     'Populate Inspector   ...  End Sub  Once we have a MediaViewer to inspect, we can then proceed to populate the ListView with as much information as we care to extract from the Media- Viewer. First, we create a “General” section with some useful data that would be common to most media ﬁles:  'Add the General section AddSection "General"   Dim fi As FileInfo = New FileInfo mv.FileName  AddProperty "FileName", fi.Name  AddProperty "Modified", fi.LastWriteTime.ToString    AddProperty "Size",              Format m_viewer.Movie.Size   1000, "0.000"  + " KB"  w = m_viewer.Movie.Width h = m_viewer.Movie.Height AddProperty "Dimensions  Current ", CStr w  + " x " + CStr h   Dim rNatural As QTRECT = m_viewer.Movie.NaturalRect w = rNatural.right - rNatural.left h = rNatural.bottom - rNatural.top AddProperty "Dimensions  Normal ", CStr w  + " x " + CStr h   AddProperty "MIME Type", m_viewer.Movie.MIMEType   AddSection  and  AddProperty  are  private  helper  routines  that  I  have added to our MediaInspector class to make life easier. AddSection simply adds a row to the ListView in a different color and gives it a heading, while AddProperty  adds  a  row  and  sets  the  contents  of  the  Property  and  Value columns.  'Adds a section heading to the ListView Private Sub AddSection ByVal heading As String     Dim item As New ListViewItem heading, 0    item.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Wheat   m_lvInfo.Items.Add item   End Sub  Implementation 229   'Adds a property and its value to the ListView Private Sub AddProperty ByVal prop As String, ByVal value As String     Dim item As New ListViewItem prop, 0    item.SubItems.Add value    m_lvInfo.Items.Add item   End Sub  Different types of media ﬁles have particular properties of interest, so it’s useful  to  be  able  to  differentiate  between  the  fundamental  types  of  media ﬁles  that  QuickTime  can  open,  such  as  video,  image,  and  audio  ﬁles.  The MIMEType property comes in handy here again. If the ﬁle opened is an image, then we create a new “Image” section in our property list and add several pertinent properties of the image; whereas, if it’s an audio ﬁle, we add an “Audio” section. The “Movie” section is really a catchall for everything else.  Dim bIsImage As Boolean Dim bIsAudio As Boolean  bIsImage = Microsoft.VisualBasic.Left m_viewer.Movie.MIMEType, 5               = "image" bIsAudio = Microsoft.VisualBasic.Left m_viewer.Movie.MIMEType, 5               = "audio"  If bIsImage Then    AddSection "Image"    AddProperty "Format", m_viewer.Movie.Tracks 1 .Format    AddProperty "Color Depth", CStr m_viewer.Movie.Tracks 1 .Depth    ElseIf bIsAudio Then    AddSection "Audio"    AddProperty "Duration", CStr m_viewer.Movie.Duration     AddProperty "Format", m_viewer.Movie.Tracks 1 .             AudioFormatSummaryString    AddProperty "Channels", CStr m_viewer.Movie.Tracks 1 .             AudioChannelCount     AddProperty "Channel Layout", m_viewer.Movie.Tracks 1 .             AudioChannelLayoutString   230 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media     AddSection "Movie"    AddProperty "Duration", CStr m_viewer.Movie.Duration      'Iterate over tracks   For i = 1 To m_viewer.Movie.Tracks.Count     If i = 1 Then AddSection "Tracks"      AddProperty "Track " + CStr i , m_viewer.Movie.Tracks i .Format    Next i  Else  End If  Last, we turn to Annotations. As we have already discovered in Chapter 5, QuickTime does a reasonably competent job of unifying access to metadata irrespective of its source, whether it be from a QuickTime movie, an MP3 ﬁle, or a JPEG image. So in this case all we have to do is attempt to get data from a list of well-deﬁned annotations. If our media ﬁle does not have a par- ticular item, we just move on to the next. The end result, for any ﬁle that is appropriately tagged, is usually a useful synopsis of information:  'Add the Annotations section AddSection "Annotations"   AddAnnotationProperty "Name",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationFullName  AddAnnotationProperty "Info",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationInformation  AddAnnotationProperty "Description",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationDescription  AddAnnotationProperty "Comment",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationComments  AddAnnotationProperty "Artist",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationArtist  AddAnnotationProperty "Album",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationAlbum  AddAnnotationProperty "Genre",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationGenre  AddAnnotationProperty "Author",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationAuthor  AddAnnotationProperty "Copyright",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationCopyright   Implementation 231   AddAnnotationProperty "Software",              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationSoftware   AddAnnotationProperty is another convenient helper routine.  'Adds an Annotation property if present Private Sub AddAnnotationProperty ByVal propName As String,              ByVal annotationID As Long     Dim val As String    If IsNothing m_viewer  Then Exit Sub    val = m_viewer.GetAnnotation annotationID     If Trim val    "" Then AddProperty propName, val   End Sub  Instead of accessing m_viewer.Movie.Annotation directly, we have adopted good OOP practice by adding a GetAnnotation function to our MediaViewer so as to encapsulate the speciﬁcs of getting an Annotation from the movie.  'Gets an Annotation from the movie if present Public Function GetAnnotation ByVal annotationID As Long  As String    Dim val As String = ""   Try     val = Me.Movie.Annotation annotationID    Catch e As Exception     'Ignore error   End Try    GetAnnotation = val  End Function  With  our  MediaInspector  more  or  less  complete,  all  that  remains  is  to plumb it in to our main application and see if it works. To incorporate the MediaInspector, we add two routines to our MediaDisplayPanel:  232 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   'Hide Show the MediaInspector Sub MediaInspectorToggle      If Not IsMediaInspectorOpen   Then     m_mediaInspector = New MediaInspector     m_mediaInspector.Owner = CType Me.Parent, Form      m_mediaInspector.StartPosition = FormStartPosition.Manual     m_mediaInspector.DesktopLocation =             New Point Me.Parent.Left + Me.Parent.Width + 20,                        Me.Parent.Top      m_mediaInspector.Show     Else     m_mediaInspector.Close       m_mediaInspector.Dispose     End If  End Sub  'Returns TRUE if the MediaInspector is open Private Function IsMediaInspectorOpen   As Boolean    Dim bRet As Boolean = True    If IsNothing m_mediaInspector  Then     bRet = False   Else     'If the X button on the Inspector was clicked, then the     'form will be disposed but not necessarily set to Nothing     'if the garbage collector hasn’t come around     If m_mediaInspector.IsDisposed Then       bRet = False     End If   End If    Return bRet  End Function  MediaInspectorToggle toggles the MediaInspector palette open or closed and is attached to the Media  Info... item off the main menu. Note how our MainForm is made the owner of the MediaInspector after it is created. This  Implementation 233   ensures that our MediaInspector  hangs out closely with our main applica- tion  form  should,  for  example,  we  minimize  our  application  or  switch  to another application. IsMediaInspectorOpen returns True if the MediaInspec- tor is open.  In More Depth The function IsMediaInspectorOpen turns out to be nontrivial because we have allowed our MediaInspector to have a close box—the small X in its top right-hand corner—mak- ing it possible for the MediaInspector to be closed without the MediaDisplayPanel to whom  it  belongs  being  aware  of  it.  You  might  imagine  that  IsNothing m_media- Inspector  would be sufﬁcient to determine if the inspector is closed or open. Unhappily though, just because a form is closed, we cannot assume that object references to that form  will  be  set  to  Nothing.  This  only  happens  once  the  Common  Language  Runtime  CLR  garbage collector comes along and actually frees the memory used by the form. The useful IsDisposed function determines if our form is one of these zombie objects awaiting the attentions of the garbage collector.  Now that we can open and close our MediaInspector, let’s make it a little more useful by actually connecting it to whichever MediaViewer we click on. Since our MediaViewer inherits from the QuickTime Control, we should be able  to  intercept  the  control’s MouseDownEvent.  All  we  have  to  do  is  add  a handler  for  this  event  in  our  MediaDisplayPanel  after  we  create  a  Media- Viewer in MediaDisplayPanel.Load  :  'Add event handlers AddHandler mv.MouseDownEvent, AddressOf MediaViewerMouseDown  and create a handler routine for the event:  'Handles MouseDown event from media viewer Private Sub MediaViewerMouseDown ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As              AxQTOControlLib._IQTControlEvents_MouseDownEvent     Dim mv As MediaViewer    'Cast sender object to a MediaViewer   mv = CType sender, MediaViewer      'Select the viewer   SelectMediaViewer mv   234 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media     'Load the MediaInspector   If IsMediaInspectorOpen   Then m_mediaInspector.SetViewer mv   End Sub  Note  how  we  use  CType  to  explicitly  convert  or cast  the  generic  sender object reference to a MediaViewer object reference. This conversion is only possible, of course, because MediaViewer inherits ultimately from Object.  Note for C++ Developers CType  dynamic_cast that throws an exception if it fails.  is  essentially  equivalent  to  the  __try_cast  managed  C++  extension—a  So that we know which MediaViewer the MediaInspector refers to, I have added a SelectMediaViewer routine to the MediaDisplayPanel class. This sim- ply highlights the selected MediaViewer by altering its border color. Once the MediaViewer  is  selected,  we  pass  the  MediaInspector  a  reference  to  the selected MediaViewer using its SetViewer method.  A Tooltip  Finally, a little icing on the cake: we’ll add a tooltip containing the most use- ful metadata and have it appear when you simply move the mouse over a MediaViewer, as illustrated in the examples shown in Figure 7.9.  Figure 7.9 Typical tooltips for movie, image, and MP3 ﬁles.  Implementation 235   Windows Forms comes to the rescue once again with its ToolTip compo- nent.  We  just  add  one  to  our  MediaDisplayPanel  by  declaring  a  member variable  Private m_viewerTooltip As ToolTip  and then create our ToolTip object in MediaDisplayPanel.New  m_viewerTooltip = New ToolTip  and,  ﬁnally,  in  the  Load  method  of  MediaDisplayPanel,  we  tell  the  tooltip what to display when the mouse rolls over a MediaViewer:   'Set tooltip for the viewer m_viewerTooltip.SetToolTip mv, mv.GetTooltipInfo     Adding  the  GetTooltipInfo  function  to  our  MediaViewer  class  lets  us  deﬁne exactly what should be displayed in the tooltip:  'Returns info for the MediaViewer tooltip  Public Function GetTooltipInfo   As String    Dim nSaveImageIndex As Integer   Dim strInfo As String = ""    AppendAnnotation strInfo,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationComments    AppendAnnotation strInfo,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationInformation    AppendAnnotation strInfo,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationFullName    AppendAnnotation strInfo,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationArtist    AppendAnnotation strInfo,             QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationAlbum    AppendAnnotation strInfo,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationDescription    AppendAnnotation strInfo,              QTAnnotationsEnum.qtAnnotationCopyright     Return strInfo  236 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media   Summary  End Function  'Appends Annotation to line-delimited info string if item exists Private Sub AppendAnnotation ByRef info As String,              ByVal annotationID As Long     Dim val As String = GetAnnotation annotationID    If val = "" Then Exit Sub    If info   "" Then info += vbCrLf   info += val  End Sub  And that’s it: a very useful tooltip facility for very little effort indeed. If you have iTunes, or other music collection software, go point the Media Browser at a couple of folders of music ﬁles and you’ll appreciate the tooltip!  The completed Media Browser application MediaBrowserVB Complete, shown in Figure 7.10, may be found at  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples  Of course, we could add lots more to our Media Browser, for example   cid:2  Ability to double-click on a MediaViewer to open it full size in a separate   cid:2  Ability to edit any annotation in the MediaInspector and save it back to  window  the media file   cid:2  Facility to drag-and-drop media files into the MediaDisplayPanel  No doubt you can think of still more features. Hopefully, the approach that I’ve used in this chapter will give you the conﬁdence to extend and adapt this simple Media Browser into something really useful.  Looking  back  on  what  we’ve  achieved  in  this  chapter,  I’m  sure  you’ll agree that leveraging the .NET Framework in conjunction with the Quick- Time  Control  is  an  impressive  way  of  rapidly  building  feature-rich QuickTime-based applications.  Summary 237   Figure 7.10 Completed Media Browser.  Using a RAD environment does not exempt us from the need to design and plan our applications carefully. If anything, it encourages us to be more rigorous  in  the  application  of  good  OOP  principles  since  the  underlying .NET  Framework  is  so  thoroughly  object-based  from  the  ground  up.  Not only  that,  but  the  existence  of  so  many  rich  Windows  Forms  components frees us from a lot of the tedium often associated with developing UI-based applications. Instead, we have been able to concentrate most of our energies on the application itself and our QuickTime-speciﬁc code.  238 Chapter 7 Browsing the Media                            8  8  Scripting QuickTime Player  Introduction  Incredible though it might seem to the more cynical among us, computers were indeed conceived to make our lives easier—in particular by relieving us of the drudgery associated with repetitive manual tasks. Perversely though, as computers and software have become more powerful, the drudgery ele- ment hasn’t exactly faded into extinction; it’s just evolved into a more com- plex form. Anyone involved in media production will attest to this.  Dedicated  applications  often  handle  a  speciﬁc  task—such  as  color- correcting  a  video  clip—wonderfully  well.  If  you  must  perform  this  task over  and  over  again,  though,  the  shine  quickly  fades  as  it  turns  into  a chore. A complex production workﬂow may involve the use of several such applications to process and integrate the various media elements that are combined into the ﬁnished piece of content. Content producers are always on the lookout for any means of automating some or all of these tasks that eat up so much of their time.  Sample scripts for this chapter are available at  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples WSH   Scripting QuickTime on the Mac  The Mac has traditionally been the choice of professionals involved in con- tent production, and this has mainly been driven by the quality and sophisti- cation of the applications available on the Apple platform. But another not insigniﬁcant factor has been the ease with which parts—or even all—of the  239                   production  process  could  be  automated  using  the  easy-to-use  and  mature scripting  environment  that  is  AppleScript.  Eschewing  the  syntactical  com- plexity of traditional programming languages, AppleScript is a more natural —almost English-like—scripting language and as such, has particular appeal for those who have little or no programming background but are neverthe- less anxious to get the job done.  But a scripting language isn’t a lot of use on its own; to be truly useful, the applications that we want to automate need to be scriptable. We need a way to dispatch commands to the application and to retrieve data from its logical objects—in  short,  the  application  must  support  a  scripting  interface.  With AppleScript a relatively mature technology, there is no want of Mac applica- tions  exposing  such  a  scripting  interface.  Scrolling  down  the  long  list  of scriptable OS X applications, you will come across such industry stalwarts as Adobe  Acrobat,  Macromedia  Freehand,  Adobe  Illustrator,  Microsoft  Excel, Adobe  Photoshop,  and  QuarkXpress.  And,  of  course,  tucked  into  this  list along with many of Apple’s own applications is QuickTime Player.  You  can  get  a  ﬂavor  of  QuickTime  Player  scripting  from  the  following  self-explanatory script:  tell application "QuickTime Player"   activate   open file "Myrtle:Users:john:Movies:wedding.mov"   tell movie 1     set the selection start to 3000     set the selection end to 5000     cut   end tell end tell  The scripting dictionary of QuickTime Player is quite rich, allowing you to do lots of interesting things with the player application itself and with the movies that it can open.  At  this  point  you  may  well  interject:  that’s  all  ﬁne  and  well,  but  what about Windows? Is there an equivalent to AppleScript on the Windows plat- form? Let’s ﬁnd out.  240  Chapter 8   Scripting QuickTime Player                                                 Windows Scripting Host  Windows does indeed sport a scripting platform to rival AppleScript, and it comes with a decidedly more grown-up—and predictably less catchy—name:   WSH . Glamorous it may not be but Windows Script- Windows Scripting Host ing  Host  comes  with  big  ambitions:  not  content  with  supporting  a  single scripting  language,  it  boasts  an  agnostic  framework  that  claims  to  be  lan- guage  independent.  As  bundled  with  Windows   98,  2000,  and  XP ,  WSH comes  with  a  choice  of  two  scripting  languages,  VBScript  and  JScript. VBScript is the scripting version of Visual Basic and is easy to learn and use, albeit  without  the  natural-language  ﬂavor  of  AppleScript.  JScript  is Microsoft’s  implementation  of  the  ECMAScript  language,  better  known  as JavaScript. Syntactically closer to C++ and Java, JScript tends to be the pre- ferred  scripting  language  of  developers  already  familiar  with  those  lan- guages.  With  third-party  add-ons,  WSH  can  also  host  other  scripting languages such as TCL, Perl, Python, and Rexx.  Windows Scripting Host 5.6  All the examples in this chapter are based on Windows Scripting Host 5.6, which comes pre-installed with Windows XP. If you are using Windows 98, Me, 2000, or NT4, then you http:   should  make  sure  to  install  WSH  5.6   or  later ,  which  you  can  download  from  msdn.microsoft.com scripting.  The potential of the WSH environment becomes apparent when you real- ize that, with the aid of a simple function— —a script can create any of the hundreds of COM components that are registered on the system. For example,   is a very handy utility component for working with ﬁles and folders.  Scripting.FileSystemObject  WScript.CreateObject  As  a  quick  WSH  warm-up,  here’s  an  example  of  how  the   FileSystem-   object  can  be  used  in  a  very  simple  script  to  obtain  the  size  of  a  Object folder. This is what it looks like—ﬁrst in VBScript  ' GetFolderSize.vbs Dim fso, fldr Set fso = WScript.CreateObject "Scripting.FileSystemObject"  Set fldr = fso.GetFolder "D:\QuickTime\Movies"  If Not  fldr Is Nothing  Then   WScript.Echo fldr.Path + " contains " + CStr fldr.Size  + " bytes"  End If  Windows Scripting Host  241                                                                           and now in JScript:     GetFolderSize.js var fso = WScript.CreateObject "Scripting.FileSystemObject" ; var fldr = fso.GetFolder "D:\\QuickTime\\Movies" ; if  fldr    WScript.Echo fldr.Path + " contains " + fldr.Size + " bytes" ;  Apart from the obvious syntax differences, the code is remarkably simi- WScript lar—especially  the  way  in  which  the  COM  objects  are  used.  The  object is always available within a WSH script and provides useful support for creating COM objects and for handling input and output, as well as other utility functions.  A WSH script is usually saved in a text ﬁle: JScript script ﬁles use the   .js  ﬁle. Once we have ﬁle extension while VBScript should be saved into a  running the script is as simple a script ﬁle—for example,  as double-clicking on the ﬁle on the desktop or in Windows Explorer. Win- dows will invoke   GetFold- erSize.js   to run the script for us. The result, for  GetFolderSize.js—  wscript.exe  .vbs  , is  Scripts can also be run from within the Command window as   scripts, this time using   line change directories to the folder containing the script ﬁle  can enter at the command prompt  command .

The Command window is a special window into which you can directly type commands for the Windows operating system and from which you can run batch ﬁles or scripts. It is an essential tool for developers, systems administrators, and anyone else who either needs to—or prefers to—access the operating system directly rather than through its graphical user interface  GUI .  The quickest way to invoke the Command window is to select Run… from the Start  menu, enter   cmd  , and click OK. A typical Command window is shown in Figure 8.1.  For Mac users, the Command window is the equivalent of Terminal on OS X.  Tip  If you use the Command window regularly, it is a good idea to change its font and color to something less primitive looking and more legible. To do this, right-click in the title bar of the Command window and choose Properties.  Figure 8.1  The Command window.  COM  Automation  Server  So far in this book, the COM components that we have encountered—such as the QuickTime Control or even the  —have all  Scripting.FileSystemObject  Windows Scripting Host  243                                                                     within   the host application, be it a Visual Basic .NET or C in-  objects, living out their brief lives within the single process that is the  been instantiated  executable  or,  in  the  case  of  WSH,  process running host application.    These  are   wscript.exe  cscript.exe.    or   But it is also possible to access COM objects that reside in another process or application running on the same computer or even, perhaps, running on a remote  networked  computer.  For  this  to  be  possible,  an  application  must choose to expose   as a COM object, available to other COM-aware appli- cations. Any application that exposes a public COM interface in this way is known as a   COM Automation server,   or simply a   . COM server  itself  If a client application wants to use functionality exposed by a particular COM  server   another  application ,  it  will  attempt  to  create  an  instance  of that server’s public COM interface. It does this using the programmatic iden- tiﬁer  ProgID  that the COM server will have registered with the system. If the COM server is already running, the client will get back a reference to the running application. If not, the server application will be launched, and then a reference to it will be returned. Either way, the COM object returned to the client is an   COM object, since it refers to an object that resides in another process.  out-of-process  The  COM  interface  exposed  by  a  COM  server  is  its  public  face,  so  to speak.  It  will  expose  selected  application  functionality  and  may  reveal  an internal COM object model of the application and of the documents that the application currently holds open.  All  this  may  sound  rather  complicated  and  is  really  best  understood  by way of an example. The Microsoft Ofﬁce suite of applications—Word, Excel, PowerPoint,  Access,  and  others—are  all  popular  COM  servers.  The  ProgID for  Word  is    and  scripting  it  is  straightforward.  Here’s  a script that will open a document and display the number of words in it:  Word.Application     Open a document and count the words var wordApp = WScript.CreateObject "Word.Application" ; if  wordApp  {   wordApp.Visible = true;   wordApp.Documents.Open "UserGuide.doc" ;   WScript.Echo "Words: " + wordApp.ActiveDocument.Characters.Count ;   wordApp.Quit  ; }  244  Chapter 8   Scripting QuickTime Player                                                               Notice that the application object—  , the collection of open documents, and   —has child objects: in this case Documents , the cur- rent active document. Drilling down through the COM object hierarchy, we are  able  to  access  the    collection  of  the  document  and  get  its Count  ActiveDocument  Characters   property.  wordApp  Just for interest, here’s the equivalent AppleScript script:  tell application "Microsoft Word"   activate   open file "UserGuide.doc"   display dialog "Words: " &  count each word in window 1    quit end tell  It should be obvious that the COM server on Windows is the analog of the scriptable application on the Mac. And, if we can script QuickTime Player on the Mac, surely it ought to be possible to script QuickTime Player on Win- dows as a COM server.  QuickTime Player: A COM Server  Sure  enough,  as  of  QuickTime  7.0.2,  QuickTime  Player  on  Windows  has opened its stall for business as a COM server, happily offering its services to any COM client that cares to create an instance of   QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp.  Opening and Playing a Movie  It only takes a few lines of code to launch Player and open a movie:  var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject              "QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  if  qtPlayerApp != null  {   var qtPlayer = qtPlayerApp.Players 1 ;    if  qtPlayer      qtPlayer.OpenURL "d:\\QuickTime\\Movies\\sample.mov" ; }  QuickTime Player: A COM Server  245                                                                                 The  COM  class  that  “wraps”  the  QuickTime  Player  application  and exposes  it  for  scripting  is    is  an instance. Creating an object of this class will launch QuickTime Player if it is not already running.  QuickTimePlayerApp  qtPlayerApp  ,  of  which   The   qtPlayerApp   property of  QTControl  QTControl  is where the fun starts—it returns an  object  of  type    or,  in  other  words,  the  instance  of  the  Quick- Time Control that is in use by the QuickTime Player window. Just as we’ve done many times in earlier chapters, we can obtain the   object via the control’s   property. Suddenly the entire QuickTime Object Model is exposed and available for the scripting developer just as if we had instanti- ated a QuickTime Control in our own application.  QTMovie  Movie  To play the movie, we need only add one more line  qtPlayer.QTControl.Movie.Play  ;  and to list the format for each track of the movie:  var mov = qtPlayer.QTControl.Movie;  if  mov  {   var s = "";   for  var i=1; i<=mov.Tracks.Count; i++    {     if  s != ""  s += "\n";     s += "Track " + i + ": " + mov.Tracks i .Format;   }   WScript.Echo s ; }  The QuickTime Player Object Model  The QuickTime Player object model  Figure 8.2  shows the core classes in the  QuickTime  Player  object  library  as  well  as  the  relationship  that  exists between QuickTime Player and the QuickTime Object Model that we ﬁrst  class, which can be met in Chapter 4. At the root is the  considered  to  encapsulate  the  entire  QuickTime  Player  application.  This class has a   method that has the same effect as selecting File  Exit in QuickTime Player. To check it out, launch QuickTime Player manually and open several new player windows. This rather pointless script will connect  QuickTimePlayerApp  Quit  246  Chapter 8   Scripting QuickTime Player   QuickTimePlayerApp  QuickTimePlayers  QuickTimePlayer  QTControl                           QTOControlLib  QTQuickTime  QTMovie  Figure 8.2 The QuickTime Player object model.  QuickTimePlayerLib  QTOLibrary  to the currently running QuickTime Player application and promptly pulls the plug on it:     Quit QuickTime Player var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject              "QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  if  qtPlayerApp != null    qtPlayerApp.Quit  ;  Players  QuickTimePlayers  Of considerably greater interest is the    property of the application: this  returns  the    collection,  which  is  a  collection  of  the player windows that happen to be open at this moment in time. Each item in the QuickTimePlayers collection is an instance of the QuickTimePlayer class and wraps a QuickTime Player window. Manipulating the window is possi- ble using the various properties and methods of this class. In essence, the QuickTime Player window is just a fancy wrapper around a QuickTime Con- trol. The QuickTimePlayer class has a QTControl property that returns a ref- erence to its QuickTime Control. This is our gateway to the movie itself and to the other QuickTime objects that we have become familiar with.  QuickTime Player: A COM Server  247   Working with Players  If you launch QuickTime Player manually again, this time opening several movies in different windows, and run the following script, you will ﬁnd that the player windows are listed in the order in which you opened them.  var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject              "QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  if  qtPlayerApp != null  {   var s = "";   for  var i=1; i<=qtPlayerApp.Players.Count; i++    {     var qtPlayer = qtPlayerApp.Players i ;     if  s != ""  s += "\n";     s += "Player " + i + ": " + qtPlayer.QTControl.URL;   }   WScript.Echo s ; }  Close a player window or open a new window and run the script again.  The result should be different.  Opening a movie under script control in a QuickTime Player window can be accomplished in two ways. If we have an existing player window, as is always the case when QuickTime Player is ﬁrst launched, then we can use the OpenURL method of QuickTimePlayer:  var qtPlayer = qtPlayerApp.Players 1 ;  if  qtPlayer    qtPlayer.OpenURL "d:\\QuickTime\\Movies\\sample.mov" ;  Or we can add a new empty player window:  qtPlayerApp.Players.Add  ;  var qtPlayer = qtPlayerApp.Players qtPlayerApp.Players.Count ;  if  qtPlayer    qtPlayer.OpenURL "d:\\QuickTime\\Movies\\sample.mov" ;  248 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player   For  convenience  the  Add  method  can  take  an  optional  URL  parameter,  which opens a new window and loads a movie all in one go:  qtPlayerApp.Players.Add "d:\\QuickTime\\Movies\\sample.mov" ;  Once we have a QuickTimePlayer object, we can do quite a lot with it. If opening several movies, it is often useful to be able to organize them on the screen:     Cascade player windows var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject              "QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  if  qtPlayerApp == null  WScript.Quit  ;  for  var i=1; i<=qtPlayerApp.Players.Count; i++  {   var qtPlayer = qtPlayerApp.Players i ;  var x = 50; var y = 50; var dx = 50; var dy = 50;    qtPlayer.Move x, y ;    x += dx;   y += dy; }  As well as moving the player window, you can Activate it  i.e., bring it to  the front  or Close it.  The QuickTimePlayer method that provides the most scope for experimen- tation  is  DoMenu.  Exactly  as  it  states,  DoMenu  will  execute  one  of  the  menu items in the QuickTime Player menus.  We can open a movie and then display it full screen:  qtPlayer.OpenURL "d:\\QuickTime\\Movies\\sample.mov" ; qtPlayer.DoMenu "View", "Full Screen" ; qtPlayer.QTControl.Movie.Play  ;  QuickTime Player: A COM Server 249   The  ﬁrst  parameter  for  DoMenu  is  the  name  of  the  menu—in  this  case, “View”. The second parameter is the name of a menu item in that menu— ”Full Screen”. The optional third parameter allows you to specify a submenu item. You’ll get the idea when you try  qtPlayer.DoMenu "Window", "Favorites", "Show Favorites" ;  The beauty of DoMenu is that it allows us to automate many of the manual procedures that can be carried out using the QuickTime Player menus. Of particular interest are those menu items that reside in the Edit menu. You will recall from Chapter 6 that simple cut, copy, and paste type operations allow us to do some quite sophisticated production tasks. With DoMenu, we don’t even need to know anything about the QuickTime Control, since the basic editing functions are available at the player window level.  QuickTime Player Pro If you want to get the most out of QuickTime Player scripting, especially with DoMenu, then you will need to shell out for the Pro version of QuickTime. Visit  www.apple.com quicktime pro win.html  A Movie Builder Script  To give you an idea of what can be achieved, let’s look at a more complex script,  this  time  using  QuickTime  Player  automation  in  conjunction  with the Windows Scripting library to build a composite movie from a folder of movies.  First, we launch player and open a second player window into which we  will assemble the new movie:     BuildMovieSimple.js : create a movie from a folder of movies var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject "QuickTimePlayerLib.             QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  var sourcePath = "D:\\Movies\\Birds\\Kittiwake"; var destFile = "D:\\Movies\\Exported\\NewMovie.mov";  if  qtPlayerApp != null  {   var qtPlayerSrc = qtPlayerApp.Players 1 ;  250 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player     qtPlayerApp.Players.Add  ;   var qtPlayerDest = qtPlayerApp.Players qtPlayerApp.Players.Count ;   qtPlayerDest.Visible = true; }  At this point we have a source player  qtPlayerSrc  in which we can open movies and copy them to the clipboard plus a destination player  qtPlayer- Dest  into which we can paste each movie. The FileSystemObject comes in handy to obtain the Files collection of the source folder. Using a JScript Enu- merator,  we  can  iterate  over  the  source  movies,  copying  each  to  the  clip- board using the “Copy” menu item of qtPlayerSrc and pasting them into the destination movie using the “Paste” menu item of qtPlayerDest.  if   qtPlayerSrc == null    qtPlayerDest == null   WScript.Quit  ;  var fso = WScript.CreateObject "Scripting.FileSystemObject" ; var fldr = fso.GetFolder sourcePath ;     Regular expression to match file extension var re = new RegExp ".mov$", "i" ;     Iterate over the source files var fc = new Enumerator fldr.Files ; for  ; !fc.atEnd  ; fc.moveNext    {      Filter by file extension   if  !re.test fc.item  .Name      continue;       Open the movie   qtPlayerSrc.OpenURL fc.item   ;       Paste into destination movie   qtPlayerSrc.DoMenu "Edit", "Select All" ;   qtPlayerSrc.DoMenu "Edit", "Copy" ;   qtPlayerDest.DoMenu "Edit", "Paste" ; }  qtPlayerDest.DoMenu "Edit", "Select None" ;  QuickTime Player: A COM Server 251   When  iterating  over  a  folder  of  ﬁles,  there  is  always  the  possibility  of encountering the odd ﬁle of a type that we’re not interested in—for example, the cache ﬁle of an image browser. In the preceding code, we use a regular expression  “.mov$” meaning any string that ends with “.mov”  that we test against each ﬁle name. If the test fails, then we continue to the next ﬁle.  Having  assembled  a  movie,  it  would  be  sensible  to  save  it,  but  this  is  where the limitations of DoMenu become apparent. Yes, we can call  qtPlayerDest.DoMenu "File", "Save As…" ;  but all we get is QuickTime Player’s Save A File dialog box: our automation has suddenly run into a brick wall. But all is not lost; this is the time to reach down for the movie object  QTControl.Movie  and use its Save or SaveSelf- Contained method directly:  var mov = qtPlayerDest.QTControl.Movie;  if  mov    mov.SaveSelfContained destFile ;  Now that we have our hands on the movie  QTMovie  object, there’s really no limit to what we can get up to behind QuickTime Player’s back. Borrow- ing from our MovieBuilder sample in Chapter 6, let’s see if we can superim- pose a logo:     From BuildMovieWithLogo.js     Start with the destination movie var movDest = qtPlayerDest.QTControl.Movie;  var logoFile = "D:\\QuickTime\\Movies\\Birds\\Logo.png";  if  movDest  {      Open the logo graphic in a new player window   qtPlayerApp.Players.Add  ;   var qtPlayerLogo = qtPlayerApp.Players qtPlayerApp.Players.Count ;   qtPlayerLogo.Visible = true;    qtPlayerLogo.OpenURL logoFile ;  252 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player        Copy the logo into the destination movie   if  qtPlayerLogo.QTControl.Movie    {     qtPlayerLogo.QTControl.Movie.Copy  ;          movDest.SelectAll  ;     movDest.AddScaled  ;     movDest.Time = 0;      var trkLogo = movDest.Tracks movDest.Tracks.Count ;         Adjust logo position and transfer mode     if  trkLogo      {       trkLogo.Left = movDest.Right - trkLogo.Width - 10;       trkLogo.Top = 10;                     Define enumeration constant       var qtTransferModeStraightAlphaBlend = 260;                  trkLogo.TransferMode = qtTransferModeStraightAlphaBlend;       trkLogo.OperationColor = "32768, 32768, 32768";       trkLogo.HighQualityMode = true;     }   }       Tidy up   qtPlayerSrc.Close  ;   qtPlayerLogo.Close  ;   qtPlayerDest.DoMenu "Edit", "Select None" ;       Save the new movie   movDest.SaveSelfContained destFile ;   WScript.Echo "New movie created of duration: " + movDest.Duration ; }  This employs exactly the same technique as was used in Chapter 6; that is, AddScaled is used to paste the logo into the destination movie as a new video track superimposed on the movie. The position and transfer mode of this logo track are then adjusted.  QuickTime Player: A COM Server 253   Notice  that  we  had  to  explicitly  deﬁne  the  qtTransferModeStraight- AlphaBlend  constant  since  JScript  cannot  directly  use  the  enumerated  con- stants that are deﬁned in the QTOLibrary type library. Later in this chapter we will ﬁnd a way to address this frustrating limitation.  Batch Export from the Command Line  In  a  busy  production  environment,  we  really  don’t  want  to  have  to  mess around with editing hard-coded paths in our script ﬁles, or even with having to double-click on the script ﬁles to run them. Ideally, we would like to be able to run frequently used scripts from the command line, passing a few arguments, and have the script tell us when it’s done.  Movie export is a common repetitive task that lends itself to batch pro- cessing. Taking a batch of media ﬁles in one format, we export them to a dif- ferent format or even to several different formats—perhaps for delivery on diverse platforms such as DVD, the Web, or mobile devices, such as a PDA, smartphone, or video iPod.  Let’s consider a batch export script that takes a source folder of media ﬁles and exports them, using a speciﬁed QuickTime exporter, to a destina- tion folder. The script needs to run from the command line and takes four arguments:  1. The path to the source folder 2. The path to the destination folder 3. The type of exporter to use  e.g., AVI, QuickTime Movie, DV Stream  4. The ﬁle extension for the exported ﬁles  e.g., avi, mov, dv   Exporter Types  The deﬁnitive list of available exporter types for any movie or track can be obtained from its  PotentialExporters  property.  However,  for  convenience  I’ve  listed,  in  Appendix  C, most of the standard exporter types available with QuickTime Pro.  A typical call would be  cscript BatchExport.js D:\Movies\Source D:\Movies\Dest "DV Stream" dv  In other words, we would like to take all the movies in D:\Movies\Source and export them one at a time using the QuickTime “DV Stream” exporter to similarly named ﬁles—but with the “dv” ﬁle extension—that we will put in D:\Movies\Dest.  254 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player   Tip Command line arguments that contain one or more spaces should always be enclosed in  double quotes so that they are interpreted as a single argument.  Capturing the arguments from the command line is the raison d’être of the  WScript  object’s  Arguments  collection.  It  contains  one  item  for  every white-space–delimited argument on the command line. The ﬁrst part of our batch export script involves getting the arguments followed by the tedious, but necessary, task of validating them:     BatchExport.js var sourcePath, destPath, exporterType, exportFileExtension;     Get script arguments if  WScript.Arguments.Length >= 4  {   sourcePath = WScript.Arguments 0 ;   destPath = WScript.Arguments 1 ;   exporterType = WScript.Arguments 2 ;   exportFileExtension = WScript.Arguments 3 ; }     Sanity check arguments var fso = WScript.CreateObject "Scripting.FileSystemObject" ;  var e = "";  if  !fso.FolderExists sourcePath     e += "Source path does not exist : " + "[" + sourcePath + "]\n";  if  !fso.FolderExists destPath     e += "Destination path does not exist : " + "[" + destPath + "]\n";  if  exporterType == undefined    e += "No exporter type supplied!\n";  if  exportFileExtension == undefined    e += "No exporter file extension supplied!\n";  if  e != ""  {  QuickTime Player: A COM Server 255     WScript.Echo e ;   WScript.Echo "Usage:" ;   WScript.Echo "cscript BatchExport.js  ,  ,              ,  " ;   WScript.Quit  ; }  Now that we have our parameters all lined up, the next task is to launch QuickTime Player and set ourselves up with a QTExporter object that we will need to process the movies.     Launch QuickTime Player var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject              "QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  if  qtPlayerApp == null  {   WScript.Echo "Unable to launch QuickTime Player!" ;   WScript.Quit  ; }  var qtPlayerSrc = qtPlayerApp.Players 1 ;  if  qtPlayerSrc == null    WScript.Quit  ;     Set up the exporter and have it configured var qt = qtPlayerSrc.QTControl.QuickTime; qt.Exporters.Add  ; var exp = qt.Exporters 1 ;  if  exp  {   exp.TypeName = exporterType;   exp.ShowSettingsDialog  ; }  Our QTExporter object is obtained, as we learned in Chapter 5, by ﬁrst get- ting  hold  of  the  Exporters  collection  from  QTControl.QuickTime  and  then adding an exporter. Once we have the exporter, we can set its TypeName to the  256 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player   exporter type speciﬁed on the command line. Finally, before the export pro- cess  begins,  the  Exporter  Settings  Dialog  is  opened  so  that  the  exporter options can be conﬁgured once for the batch.  At this point the process of iterating over the source ﬁles can begin.  var fldr = fso.GetFolder sourcePath ;     Regular expression to match file extension var re = new RegExp ".mov$", "i" ;     Iterate over the source files var fc = new Enumerator fldr.Files ; for  ; !fc.atEnd  ; fc.moveNext    {   var f = fc.item  .Name;       Filter by file extension   if  !re.test f       continue;    try   {        Open the movie and export it     qtPlayerSrc.OpenURL fc.item   ;      var mov = qtPlayerSrc.QTControl.Movie;     if  mov      {       exp.SetDataSource mov ;           Strip file extension and compose new file name       f = f.replace  \.[^\.]*$ , "" ;       var fDest = destPath + "\\" + f + "." + exportFileExtension;        exp.DestinationFileName = fDest;       exp.BeginExport  ;        WScript.Echo "Exported: " + fDest ;     }   }  QuickTime Player: A COM Server 257     catch  err    {     WScript.Echo "Error Exporting: " + fc.item   ;   }  }     Tidy up qtPlayerSrc.Close  ;  The code that is concerned with opening the source ﬁle and exporting it is protected within a try...catch block; thus, should an exception occur with a particular rogue ﬁle, it does not cause the whole script to fail.  Regular expressions come in handy in all sorts of places. As well as using a  regular  expression  to  ﬁlter  the  source  ﬁles  by  ﬁle  extension,  a  regular expression is also used in the JScript replace function to strip the ﬁle exten- sion off the source movie ﬁle name so that it can be replaced with export- FileExtension to create the destination ﬁle name.     Strip file extension and compose new file name f = f.replace  \.[^\.]*$ , "" ; var fDest = destPath + "\\" + f + "." + exportFileExtension;  While this batch script is concerned with exporting media ﬁles, the pro- cessing  code  could,  of  course,  easily  be  adapted  to  carry  out  other  useful tasks on a bunch of movies, such as entering a copyright notice as an annota- tion, adding in a sound track, checking format and size, and so on.  Event Handlers  Now  that  we  are  getting  more  adventurous  with  our  QuickTime  Player scripts, we begin to wonder if it might even be possible to intercept events from the QuickTime Control. One or two extra lines of code and an event handler is all it takes.  First we need to connect the outgoing events of the QuickTime Control to  our script:  WScript.ConnectObject qtPlayer.QTControl, "QTControl_" ;  258 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player   All we need now are some event handlers:     SizeChanged event handler function QTControl_SizeChanged width, height  {   WScript.Echo "SizeChanged: " + width + "," + height ; }     StatusUpdate event handler function QTControl_StatusUpdate statusCodeType, statusCode,              statusMessage  {   WScript.Echo "StatusUpdate: " + statusCodeType + ","             + statusCode + "," + statusMessage ; }  The name of each event handler function must begin with the same preﬁx as  we  speciﬁed  in  the  second  parameter  of  ConnectObject—in  this  case “QTControl_”.  Before adding these event handlers to a simple command line script that opens  a  movie,  we  need  to  do  one  more  important  thing:  make  sure  our script  stays  running  long  enough  to  catch  the  events!  Whenever  we  run  a script, it executes all the code in the script and then, having gotten its work done, the script just quits—it doesn’t hang around for any after-hours frivol- ity. The crudest way to get the script to stay running is to add something like the following at the bottom of the script:  WScript.Sleep 10000 ;  This instructs the script to hang around for 10 seconds before leaving us. This should give us enough time to see the output from our event handlers. Grab the resize handle of the player window and you should get a stream of SizeChanged events.  Here’s a typical session:  D:\Projects\QTBook\Samples\WSH>cscript              QTControl_Events.js D:\Movies\sample.mov Microsoft  R  Windows Script Host Version 5.6 Copyright  C  Microsoft Corporation 1996-2001.

The  events  that  are  really  of  interest,  however,  are  those  QuickTime Events  that  we  discussed  in  Chapter  5—events  such  as  qtEventRateWill- Change, which notiﬁes us that the movie play rate is about to change. Recall that we must register for those QuickTime Events that we want to be noti- ﬁed of by adding them to the EventListeners collection of the movie.  var mov = qtPlayer.QTControl.Movie;  if  mov  {      Register to be notified of Rate change   mov.EventListeners.Add qtEventClassStateChange,              qtEventRateWillChange ; }  You will also recall that all QuickTime Events are notiﬁed to us through the QTEvent event of the QuickTime Control, and so we need a handler for QTEvent:  260 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player      QTEvent handler function QTControl_QTEvent eventClass,              eventID, phase, eventObject, cancel  {   WScript.Echo "QTEvent: " + eventClass + "," + eventID ; }  We can put this all to good use now with a script that launches QuickTime Player, loads a movie that we specify on the command line, plays it through, and then quits. This is only possible if we can determine when the movie has stopped playing so that we can close it and exit Player. Here’s the complete script:     LoadPlayAndQuit.js  var fileName;     qtEvent constants var qtEventClassStateChange = 0x73746174; var qtEventRateWillChange   = 0x72617465; var qtEventParamMovieRate   = 0x72617465;     Get the filename if  WScript.Arguments.Length > 0    fileName = WScript.Arguments 0 ; else   fileName = "d:\\QuickTime\\Movies\\sample.mov";     Launch QuickTime Player var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject              "QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  var movieStopped = false;  if  qtPlayerApp == null  WScript.Quit  ;  var qtPlayer = qtPlayerApp.Players 1 ;  QuickTime Player: A COM Server 261   if  qtPlayer  {      Connect this script to events from QTControl   WScript.ConnectObject qtPlayer.QTControl, "QTControl_" ;    qtPlayer.OpenURL fileName ;    var mov = qtPlayer.QTControl.Movie;    if  mov    {        Register to be notified of Rate change     mov.EventListeners.Add qtEventClassStateChange,              qtEventRateWillChange ;      mov.Play  ;   } }     Wait for movie to finish playing while  !movieStopped  {   WScript.Sleep 100 ; }     Quit QuickTime Player and exit the script qtPlayerApp.Quit  ;  WScript.Quit  ;     QTEvent handler function QTControl_QTEvent eventClass, eventID,              phase, eventObject, cancel  {     switch  eventID    {     case qtEventRateWillChange:       var rate = eventObject.GetParam qtEventParamMovieRate ;       if  rate == 0.0          movieStopped = true;   } }  262 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player   This time we keep the script going by running a while loop that polls a movieStopped ﬂag every 100 milliseconds. Just before we Play the movie, we register for qtEventRateWillChange so that we will be notiﬁed whenever the play  rate  changes.  When  that  happens,  our  event  handler—QTControl_ QTEvent—is called and in it we get the qtEventParamMovieRate parameter. If it equals zero, the movie must have stopped playing, and it’s time to bail out by setting movieStopped to true.  Again, we have had to explicitly deﬁne the qtEvent constants that we have used due to the lack of support in JScript for enumerated constants.  See the section “Windows Scripting File  .wsf  Format” later in this chapter for a bet- ter solution.   Script Droplets  Script users on the Mac have a particular weakness for AppleScript droplets. A droplet is a script onto which you can drag and drop one or more ﬁles or folders. The script will then proceed to do something to every ﬁle or folder. So,  for  example,  you  might  have  a  HalfScale  droplet  onto  which  you  can drop a folder; each movie in the folder is then opened and scaled by 50 per- cent. No fewer than 40 QuickTime Player droplets are listed at www.apple. com applescript quicktime .  Windows Scripting users needn’t feel left out—creating droplets from our scripts is a cinch. In fact, we’ve already done it! Open a second Windows Explorer window, browse to some movies, and then drag a single movie ﬁle and drop it onto the LoadPlayAndQuit.js script ﬁle that we have just written. The movie will be opened just as if we had passed it as an argument on the command line.  In fact, any script that can take a list of ﬁles or folders as arguments on the command line can also have those same ﬁles or folders dropped onto it. In both cases the list of ﬁles and folders ends up in the WScript.Arguments collection.  With  the  addition  of  just  a  couple  of  extra  lines  of  code  the  Load- PlayAndQuit.js script can easily turn into a useful load movie and play it full screen droplet. Immediately before we play the movie, we invoke the Quick- Time Player’s “Full Screen” menu item:  qtPlayer.DoMenu "View", "Full Screen" ; mov.Play  ;  and, to ensure an orderly shutdown, we set the movie back to normal size before we quit:  QuickTime Player: A COM Server 263      Quit QuickTime Player and exit the script qtPlayer.DoMenu "View", "Normal Size" ; WScript.Sleep 100 ; qtPlayerApp.Quit  ;  The WScript.Sleep 100  gives Player a little time to compose itself before we kill it.  Finally, here is a useful droplet that can be used to set the copyright anno- tation of every movie that is dropped on it. It’s a script that can easily be adapted to do almost anything we like to a batch of movies:     SetMoviesCopyright.js       Drop a list of movies onto this script  var qtAnnotationCopyright = 0x63707274;     Get script arguments if  WScript.Arguments.Length == 0  {   WScript.Echo "You must drop at least one file onto this script!" ;   WScript.Quit  ; }     Launch QuickTime Player var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject              "QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  if  qtPlayerApp == null  {   WScript.Echo "Unable to launch QuickTime Player!" ;   WScript.Quit  ; }  var qtPlayer = qtPlayerApp.Players 1 ;  if  qtPlayer == null    WScript.Quit  ;     Regular expression to match file extension var re = new RegExp ".mov$", "i" ;  264 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player      Iterate over the source files var n = 0; for  var i = 0; i < WScript.Arguments.Length; i++  {   var f = WScript.Arguments i ;       Filter by file extension   if  !re.test f       continue;    try   {     qtPlayer.OpenURL f ;     var mov = qtPlayer.QTControl.Movie;     if  mov      {       mov.Annotation qtAnnotationCopyright          = "  2005 Red Rooster Productions";       mov.Save  ;       n++;     }   }   catch  err    {     WScript.Echo "ERROR: " + f ;   } }     Tidy up qtPlayer.Close  ;  WScript.Echo "Copyright successfully added to " + n + " movies!" ;  Windows Scripting File  .wsf  Format  If your script frequently references the various QuickTime constants such as the  qtEvent  or  qtAnnotation  IDs,  you  can  avoid  the  tedium  of  having  to deﬁne these constants by packaging your script in a proper Windows Script File  .wsf . You can then explicitly reference the QTOLibrary and QTOControl- Lib typelibs so that all the enumerated constants are available to your script.  QuickTime Player: A COM Server 265   A script in the .wsf format looks like this:                                                      -- Script starts here -- var qtPlayerApp = WScript.CreateObject              "QuickTimePlayerLib.QuickTimePlayerApp" ;  if  qtPlayerApp != null  {   var qtPlayer = qtPlayerApp.Players 1 ;    if  qtPlayer      qtPlayer.OpenURL "d:\\QuickTime\\Movies\\sample.mov" ; }    -- Script ends here --          Scripts packaged in the .wsf format behave exactly as if they were .js or .vbs ﬁles.  A bonus is that you can also include other .js script ﬁles, and use functions  deﬁned in them, just as you might in a web page:     If so inclined, you can even mix scripts in different languages in the same .wsf ﬁle, calling functions in one language from another  with some caveats, of course! :  266 Chapter 8 Scripting QuickTime Player         $WScript->Echo "Hello world!" ;    Summary  You  should  now  be  well  equipped  to  experiment  with  writing  your  own scripts  to  automate  QuickTime  Player  and  to  harness  the  power  of  the underlying  QuickTime  Object  Model  that  it  exposes.  Many  of  the  Quick- Time production tasks that used to be the preserve of scripters using Apple- Script on the Mac can now be accomplished just as easily on Windows.  Don’t forget either, that your scripts can automate other applications in conjunction with QuickTime Player, making it possible to interchange data between other applications and the QuickTime movies that you are working with.  Summary 267                           9  9  QuickTime Meets Ofﬁce QuickTime Development in Microsoft Excel and Access  Introduction  When  it  comes  to  Windows  applications  that  bare  their  inner  souls  to  be scripted—or automated—the Microsoft Ofﬁce family of applications arguably tops  the  pile.  Word,  Excel,  Outlook,  Access,  PowerPoint—even  Visio  and Publisher—all  sport  deep  and  extensive  object  models  exposing  everything from the formula in a spreadsheet cell to the individual characters in a Word document or the properties of a ﬁeld in a database table. Most of the Ofﬁce applications can act as COM automation servers under the control of exter- nal scripts, just as we have done with QuickTime Player in Chapter 8.  Not only that, but Ofﬁce applications also feature a powerful internal pro- gramming  language  known  as  Visual  Basic  for  Applications   VBA .  Armed with the object model for an application, with its access to the logical objects and UI elements of a spreadsheet or Word document, a VBA script developer can very quickly pull together impressive mini-applications that come in the guise  of  an  Excel  or  Word  document.  VBA  is  a  full-featured  programming language that is almost indistinguishable from Visual Basic 6.  But  where  Visual  Basic  enjoys  the  open  spaces  of  its  own  forms  and  a toolbox  full  of  controls  with  which  to  populate  them,  in  a  typical  Ofﬁce application VBA is restricted to using the current document window or form as its playing ﬁeld. And as for controls, there is a limited set of standard UI controls that can be placed on this window, such as a button, text ﬁeld, or list box.  These  are  available  from  the  accessible  via  View   Toolbars  Control Toolbox in any Ofﬁce application.  Control  Toolbox—  269                                    Nestling in the lower right-hand corner of the Control Toolbox is a button whose  icon,  disquietingly  reminiscent  of  a  political  symbol,  displays  a crossed hammer and wrench. Click on this More Controls button and you will be presented with a long list of all the COM controls that are registered on the system. Close to the top of the list, you should ﬁnd the  Apple Quick- . Time Control 2.0  But I’m jumping ahead: sufﬁce it to say that it is possible to use the Quick- Time  Control—to  some  extent  anyhow—in  any  of  the  Ofﬁce  applications that support  ActiveX COM  control  hosting.  Whether  a  QuickTime  Control ensconced between the paragraphs of prose in your Word document can con- ceivably serve any useful purpose is admittedly a rather moot point. How- ever,  drop  the  same  control  onto  an  Excel  worksheet  or  Access  form,  and interesting possibilities begin to emerge, as we shall see.  Fortunately, the applications in the Ofﬁce suite share much in common. If we  learn  how  to  add  a  QuickTime  Control  to  a  document  or  form  in  one Ofﬁce application, the procedure is usually very similar in the others. In this chapter we concentrate on those two Ofﬁce heavyweights that are likely to be of most interest to anyone whose task it is to manage or produce Quick- Time content: Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access.  Note  The samples in this chapter are all based on Ofﬁce 2003. If you are using an earlier version of Ofﬁce, it should be possible to get the samples working—with perhaps a few differ- ences here and there—since ActiveX support has not changed signiﬁcantly in Ofﬁce 2003.  Excel  For all its curiosity value, a spreadsheet that can play a movie in among its rows  and  columns  of  ﬁgures  is  unlikely  to  have  you  jumping  up  excitedly and  exclaiming  “That  is    what  I  need!”  But  we’ll  persevere,  you  never know—perhaps it might come in handy after all.  just  270  Chapter 9   QuickTime Meets Ofﬁce                        Adding the QuickTime Control  Having launched Excel and created a new blank workbook, the launch pad for adding the QuickTime Control, as mentioned earlier, is the Control Tool- box  View  Toolbars  Control Toolbox . Clicking on the More Controls but- ton presents us with a list of controls from which we can select the Apple QuickTime Control as shown in Figure 9.1.  As soon as you select the QuickTime Control, the worksheet will ﬂip into Design Mode—the Design Mode button in the top-left corner of the Control Toolbox is highlighted—and the cursor will change to a crosshair. Click and drag  the  mouse  anywhere  on  the  sheet  to  place  the  QuickTime  Control. Then  right-click  on  the  new  control  and  select  Properties  to  bring  up  the Properties palette for the control. Clicking on the Custom property button will display the Property Pages for the QuickTime Control, and within this dialog we can select a movie to be loaded into the control. Alternatively you can just enter the full path and name of a movie directly into the   prop- erty ﬁeld in the Properties palette.  URL  After  dismissing  the  Properties  palette,  toggle  the  mode  button  in  the top-left corner of the Control Toolbox once again, this time to switch out of Design Mode. The movie should now load and will be overlaid on top of the worksheet cells  Figure 9.2 , with the QuickTime Control resizing itself to ﬁt the  movie.  Double-click  on  the  movie  or  click  on  the  Play  button  in  the movie controller bar, and the movie should indeed play.  Figure 9.1  Adding the QuickTime Control from the Control Toolbox.

Once you have escaped the clutches of Ofﬁce security  see ActiveX and Macro Security in the next section , the spreadsheet will open and this time the movie will be loaded straight away.

As soon as the QuickTime Control is loaded, any persistent property values are retrieved from the document and applied to the control once more, with the result that the movie is loaded immediately. Other persistent properties of MovieController- the  QuickTime  Control  include  Visible  BorderColor  BackColor  persistent  Sizing .  , and   ,   ,   ActiveX and Macro Security  VBA  scripts—confusingly  referred  to  as  Macros—are  often  disabled  by default in your Ofﬁce application.

You should select the Enable Macros button.  Whenever  you  load  an  Ofﬁce  2003  document  that  contains  an  ActiveX  control, you are likely to be confronted with a message something like this:  This application is about to initialize ActiveX controls that might be unsafe.  If you trust the source of this document, select Yes and the control will be  initialized using your document settings.  If  you  want  to  be  able  to  use  a  control  such  as  the  QuickTime  Control  in your document, then you should click Yes.  All this fuss is regrettably necessary. Ofﬁce documents containing all sorts of vile scripts are out there in force, and one is very likely to end up in your browser or email inbox at some point. Microsoft has, somewhat belatedly, gone to great lengths to put hurdles in front of such scripts. Unfortunately, for anyone genuinely wanting to use ActiveX controls or scripts in their doc- uments, all this security baggage can be a bit of a headache.  Excel  273                                                         Adding a Play Stop Cell  Having gotten a movie to open in our worksheet, the logical next step is to add a Play button. Rather than going down the predictable route of using a Command Button control from the Control Toolbox, let’s be more adventur- ous and see if we can get a worksheet cell to act as a Play Stop button. Pick- ing a free cell somewhere on our sheet, we change its background color to light blue and give it an outline border before—optimistically—entering the word   into it. At least it now looks like a button—getting it to act like a button is maybe not so simple.  Play  This  is  the  point  where  we  must  resort  to  a  VBA  script.  All  scriptable Ofﬁce applications have a VBA code editor that can be invoked using Tools  Macro  Visual Basic Editor or Alt-F11. On the left  usually , you will ﬁnd the Project  Explorer  window  listing  all  of  the  available  high-level  scriptable objects—in  this  case  the  workbook  and  its  worksheets.  Double-clicking  on Sheet1  opens  the  code  module  associated  with  Sheet1.  This  will  look instantly familiar to anyone who has programmed with Visual Basic.  Selecting Worksheet in the left-hand drop-down list at the top of the code editor, we can browse through the worksheet events in the right-hand list. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as an event that is triggered when you click on a cell: the closest we can get is the   event, which occurs whenever the current selection of cells changes. If you click on a cell Selec- that is not currently selected, then it becomes the selection, and so  tionChange  will ﬁre, simulating a click event. The only problem is that if you  ﬁre when you click on a cell the second time, want to have  you must ﬁrst select another cell elsewhere.  SelectionChange  SelectionChange  Picking   SelectionChange    from  the  right-hand  drop-down  list,  the  event  handler prototype is inserted into the code module:  Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange ByVal Target As Range   End Sub  To  work  out  which  cell  has  been  selected,  we  must  decode  the   Target event parameter. Assuming that the cell destined to be our Play Stop button is B19, our Play Stop “button” handler looks like this:  274  Chapter 9   QuickTime Meets Ofﬁce                                         Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange ByVal Target As Range     If Target.Address = Range "B19" .Address Then          If Not  QTControl1.Movie Is Nothing  Then                If QTControl1.Movie.Rate = 0 Then         QTControl1.Movie.Play       Else         QTControl1.Movie.Stop       End If                              End If      Range "B20" .Select    End If      End Sub  Notice  that  we  use   Range "B20" .Select  select  another   neutral   cell  so  that  we  will  always  get  a  event if we click on Play Stop a second time.

Movie Inspector  Working with multiple QuickTime movies—a frequent production require- ment—often involves lists of movies containing data about the movies and perhaps  annotations  that  need  to  be  added  to  the  movies.  For  this  type  of data—to be viewed or edited in a tabular format—Excel is often the ﬁrst port of call, and so this begs the question, Can we put our new-found ability to open QuickTime movies in Excel to good use in a production scenario where we’re dealing with large numbers of movies?  Excel  275                             The Movie Inspector is a spreadsheet that allows us to select a folder of movies and ﬁll a column with the ﬁle names of the movies in the folder. Selecting a cell that contains the ﬁle name of a movie will open the movie and populate the spreadsheet with detailed information about the movie. As before, we employ cells to act as buttons. The completed Movie Inspec- tor is shown in Figure 9.4 with the key cells and cell ranges identiﬁed in the accompanying Table 9.1.  Figure 9.4  Movie Inspector in Microsoft Excel.  Key cell ranges in Movie Inspector  Cell Range  Table 9.1  Function  Movies folder path List of movie files Select Folder button Apply Data button Save Movie button Close Movie button Annotations Other info Tracks details  A2 A4:An C2 C4 C6 C8 G4:G8 G10:G13 G16:n17  276  Chapter 9   QuickTime Meets Ofﬁce                                           SelectionChange  From a VBA script point of view, most of the action will be concentrated in the worksheet   event handler since all clicks on our ‘but- ton’ cells, as well as clicks on any of the listed ﬁles, end up routed through this handler. Before getting down to the nitty-gritty of this event handler, it’s worth pausing to deﬁne some constants to represent the rows and columns of the key cell ranges in our worksheet  see Table 9.1 . Using these will sim- plify  our  subsequent  code  and  spare  us  the  indignity  of  having  to  alter hard-coded values if we happen to add a row here or remove a column there.  Option Explicit  Const kDataCol = 7 Const kDataRow = 4 Const kFilesCol = 1 Const kFilesRow = 4 Const kPathCol = 1 Const kPathRow = 2 Const kCommandsCol = 3 Const kCommandsRow = 2  Note  how  the  columns  have  integer  designations   1=A,  B=2,  etc.   rather than letters. Also,   at the top of a code module forces us to explicitly deﬁne all variables: it is good discipline to insist on this at the top of every VBA module.  Explicit  Option     Now for the   SelectionChange   event handler, which is presented here in  outline, with the detailed code removed for clarity:  Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange ByVal Target As Range     Dim fileName As String   Dim rootPath As String    Select Case Target.Column          Case kFilesCol  'Select a file name                 Case kCommandsCol  'Select a button                Select Case Target.row                      Case kCommandsRow + 0:   'Select Folder                                                      Excel  277                                                         Case kCommandsRow + 2:   'Apply Movie data                                          Case kCommandsRow + 4:   'Save Movie                                      Case kCommandsRow + 6:   'Close Movie                                                                   End Select                  End Select          End Sub  You will see how the row and column constants that we deﬁned earlier are compared with   to identify the particular cell that has been selected and to determine the subsequent action. Turning now to the detailed implementation, we start with Select Folder:  Target.Column  Target.Row   and   Case kCommandsRow + 0:   'Select Folder    Dim objShell, objFolder, objFolderItem        Set objShell = CreateObject "Shell.Application"    Set objFolder = objShell.BrowseForFolder              0, "Choose Movies Folder:", 0         If objFolder Is Nothing Then Exit Sub        Set objFolderItem = objFolder.Items.Item        rootPath = objFolderItem.path        Me.Cells kPathRow, kFilesCol  = rootPath        GetListOfFiles rootPath  Using the Windows Shell object   Shell.Application  folder browse dialog.

It then proceeds to recursively call itself for each subfolder so that we end up with a list of all the ﬁles in our selected folder and any nested subfolders that it contains. So as not to unduly clutter our worksheet, each ﬁle name is stripped of the root path so that it appears in the list of ﬁles with a relative path.  kFilesCol  Now that we have a list of ﬁles, we want to be able to click on any ﬁle in   that we have the list, have it opened in the QuickTime Control   placed on the worksheet for this purpose, and have the movie data copied SelectionChange into the allocated cells. Here’s the relevant code from our  event handler:  QTControl1  Case kFilesCol  'Select a file name    If Target.row < kFilesRow Then Exit Sub    fileName = Me.Cells Target.row, kFilesCol    If fileName = "" Then Exit Sub        QTControl1.URL = ""        ClearMovieData        rootPath = Me.Cells kPathRow, kPathCol    OpenMovie rootPath + fileName  280  Chapter 9   QuickTime Meets Ofﬁce           The  ﬁle  name  is  extracted  from  the  target  cell  that  we  clicked  on, appended  to  the  root  path,  and  then  passed  to  OpenMovie.  The  function ClearMovieData will clear the range of cells that is to be populated with data about the movie. OpenMovie is not unlike similar functions that we have seen in earlier chapters:  Sub OpenMovie fileName As String     On Error GoTo ErrorHandler        Application.Cursor = xlWait   QTControl1.ErrorHandling = qtErrorHandlingRaiseException   QTControl1.URL = fileName   If Not  QTControl1.Movie Is Nothing  Then     GetMovieData   End If   Application.Cursor = xlDefault       Exit Sub      ErrorHandler:     Application.Cursor = xlDefault     MsgBox "Unable to open movie: " + fileName + vbCrLf +              "Error: " + Hex Err.Number   End Sub  Once the movie has been opened successfully, GetMovieData is called to extract data from the movie and its tracks and pop it into the relevant work- sheet cells:  Private Sub GetMovieData      Dim i As Long   Dim qtu As New QTUtils        With QTControl1.Movie     Me.Cells kDataRow + 0, kDataCol  =              GetAnnotation QTControl1.Movie, qtAnnotationFullName      Me.Cells kDataRow + 1, kDataCol  =              GetAnnotation QTControl1.Movie, qtAnnotationInformation   Excel  281       Me.Cells kDataRow + 2, kDataCol  =              GetAnnotation QTControl1.Movie, qtAnnotationComments      Me.Cells kDataRow + 3, kDataCol  =              GetAnnotation QTControl1.Movie, qtAnnotationCopyright      Me.Cells kDataRow + 4, kDataCol  =              GetAnnotation QTControl1.Movie, qtAnnotationDescription               Me.Cells kDataRow + 6, kDataCol  = QTControl1.URL     Me.Cells kDataRow + 7, kDataCol  = CStr .Width  +              " x " + CStr .Height      Me.Cells kDataRow + 8, kDataCol  = .Size   1000     Me.Cells kDataRow + 9, kDataCol  = .Duration   .TimeScale              For i = 0 To .Tracks.Count - 1         Me.Cells kDataRow + 12, kDataCol + i  =              qtu.FourCharCodeToString .Tracks i + 1 .Type          Me.Cells kDataRow + 13, kDataCol + i  = .Tracks i + 1 .Format       Next i     End With      End Sub  GetAnnotation is a helper function that returns the value of a movie anno-  tation, or an empty string if the annotation does not exist:  Function GetAnnotation ByRef mov As QTMovie,              ByVal annotationID As Long  As String    Dim val As String        val = ""   On Error GoTo Bail:   val = mov.Annotation annotationID   Bail:   GetAnnotation = val End Function  282 Chapter 9 QuickTime Meets Ofﬁce   With this we should be able to click on the ﬁle name of a movie, image, or sound and have its pertinent details displayed in our worksheet, as shown in Figure 9.4.  Movie Inspector with Annotation Editing  Once you see movie annotations popping into the cells of a spreadsheet, it’s not long before you begin to wonder if it might be possible to type something into those cells and have the edited annotations saved back to the movie.

Click Save Annotations and the copyright annotation will be rapidly applied to all the movies. If the movies have existing annotations, these may need  to  be  edited  or  modiﬁed,  perhaps  using  a  global  search  and  replace. Again, the spreadsheet is an ideal place in which to do this before updating the movies with Save Annotations.  Just as with the batch processing script in Chapter 8, ProcessMovies can be adapted to carry out any number of useful batch operations on the list of movies.  In  combination  with  the  spreadsheet  facilities  for  tabulating  and editing  data,  this  has  the  potential  to  be  a  valuable  production  tool.  The Movie_Annotator.xls sample is available from  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples Ofﬁce  While  many  of  us  contrive  somehow  to  manage  our  data  in  a  haphazard assortment of spreadsheets, anyone who really takes data management seri- ously  will  turn  to  a  database.  And  on  Windows,  at  least  for  desktop  pur- poses, this is very likely to be Microsoft Access.  Movie Display  If  our  database  relates  to  a  collection  of  content  assets—movies,  images, sounds—then  there  is  a  lot  to  be  said  for  having  the  ability  to  “view”  the asset  in  conjunction  with  its  associated  database  record.  For  example,  if working  in  forensics,  we  might  have  access  to  a  substantial  collection  of crime-scene video recordings. A keyword search in our database will retrieve a set of records through which we will then want to browse, ideally with the ability  to  view  each  video  clip  alongside  its  details  on  the  same  database form.  For the purposes of this example, and in deference to sensitive readers, we’ll swap the gory crime-scene clips for an avian database comprising just a few bird species records. Each record has an associated video clip whose ﬁle name is stored in the FileName ﬁeld. The entire Species table is shown in Figure 9.6.  288 Chapter 9 QuickTime Meets Ofﬁce   Figure 9.6 The Species table.  Figure 9.7 Wizard-generated Species form.  Feeding our Species table to the Access Create Form wizard gives us a sim- ple  form  something  like  that  shown  in  Figure  9.7.  Given  that  each  record contains the ﬁle name of a movie, our aim is to have this movie open for us on the right-hand side of this form. To achieve this, we must toggle the form into Design Mode and add a QuickTime Control—using the More Controls button  in  the  Control  Toolbox—in  exactly  the  same  way  as  we  added  the QuickTime Control to our Excel worksheet. Having done this, right-click on the  QuickTime  Control  that  has  been  added  to  the  form,  select  Properties and the All tab. Along with the familiar QuickTime Control properties, you will  notice  that  the  default  name  given  to  the  control  is  QTControl0  bizarrely—the default name is always QTControl1 in Excel and other Ofﬁce applications .  This  is  the  name  we  must  use  to  refer  to  the  control  in  our VBA script.  Access 289   Merely  plonking  a  QuickTime  Control  on  the  form  isn’t  sufﬁcient,  of course;  we  must  add  a  VBA  script  to  load  the  control  each  time  a  record changes. As with Excel, press Alt-F11 to get into the code editor and locate the Project Explorer. An object with the name Form_Species should be visi- ble and double-clicking on this should open up the code module associated with the form.  The  form  event  we  need  to  handle  is  Current.  This  event  is  triggered whenever a record becomes the current record displayed in the form. The Current event handler to load a movie each time the record changes is sim- plicity itself:  Private Sub Form_Current          If Me.Code   "" Then     QTControl0.Sizing = qtControlFitsMovie     QTControl0.URL = "D:\Movies\Grebes\" + Trim Me.FileName    Else     QTControl0.URL = ""   End If      End Sub  The form object itself is accessible through the object reference Me. Access cleverly supplements the properties of the form with the ﬁeld names of the database record so that the movie ﬁle name can be simply obtained using Me.FileName. Prepending a hard-coded path to the Movies folder, we use the value  of  Me.FileName  to  load  the  QuickTime  Control.  If  the  Code  ﬁeld  is empty, as will be the case should we add a new record, then the QuickTime Control is unloaded. In practice, of course, this handler could do with some toughening up in the form of an error handler.  Good housekeeping dictates that we clean up after ourselves by unloading the movie when the form is unloaded. This is easily handled in the form’s Unload event handler:  Private Sub Form_Unload Cancel As Integer    QTControl0.URL = ""   DoEvents End Sub  290 Chapter 9 QuickTime Meets Ofﬁce   QuickTime Event Handling  Harking back momentarily to the crime-scene video clips, our forensic spe- cialist may wish to note down the timecode of certain frames—perhaps the point where the camera focuses in on that crumpled note pinned to the vic- tim’s chest or, in our less gruesome avian example, the time when the grebe dives. We’d like the timecode to appear in a ﬁeld on the form as we drag the movie controller back or forward.  To implement this, we will need to register with the movie for its qtEvent-  TimeWillChange event:  Private Sub Form_Current          If Me.Code   "" Then     QTControl0.Sizing = qtControlFitsMovie     QTControl0.URL = "D:\Movies\Grebes\" + Trim Me.FileName               If Not  QTControl0.Movie Is Nothing  Then       QTControl0.Movie.EventListeners.Add              qtEventClassTemporal, qtEventTimeWillChange     End If    Else     QTControl0.URL = ""   End If   Me.tbTime = ""      End Sub  Next, to display the timecode we add an unbound text ﬁeld to the form called tbTime, which we can update in the QTEvent handler for our Quick- Time Control as follows:  Private Sub QTControl0_QTEvent ByVal EventClass As Long,              ByVal EventID As Long, ByVal Phase As Long,              ByVal EventObject As Object, Cancel As Boolean     Dim t As Long       Access 291     If EventID = qtEventTimeWillChange Then     t = EventObject.GetParam QTEventObjectParametersEnum.             qtEventParamMovieTime      Me.tbTime = GetTimeCode QTControl0.Movie, t    End If      End Sub  Borrowed from the MovieBuilder sample in Chapter 6, GetTimeCode has  been slightly adapted for VBA:  'Converts movie time to timecode  HH:MM:SS.ttt  format Private Function GetTimeCode ByVal mov As QTMovie, ByVal t As Long     Dim ss As Long, mm As Long, hh As Long, tt As Long   Dim dSecs As Double   Dim totalSecs As Long        dSecs = t   mov.TimeScale   totalSecs = Int dSecs     ss = totalSecs Mod 60   mm = totalSecs \ 60   hh = mm \ 60   mm = mm Mod 60   hh = hh Mod 24    tt = t -  totalSecs * mov.TimeScale     GetTimeCode = Format hh, "00:"  + Format mm, "00:"               + Format ss, "00"  + "." + Format tt, "000"   End Function  The ﬁnal result can be seen in Figure 9.8.

Summary  Ofﬁce applications such as Excel and Access can justiﬁably lay claim to being serious  developer  tools  in  their  own  right.  The  examples  in  this  chapter really only scratch the surface of what is possible when you bring the capa- bilities of QuickTime into such COM- and VBA-enabled environments. And we  haven’t  even  touched  on  other  more  specialized,  but  equally  capable, packages such as Visio and Publisher.  Before  attempting  development  with  any  of  the  Ofﬁce  applications,  it’s well worth taking the time to acquaint yourself with its object model. For obvious reasons, these differ considerably amongst the various applications, but this will help you to zero in on the relevant objects of interest, such as the Workbook object in Excel or the Form in Access. Full details of these object models and lots of other useful developer resources are available from the Microsoft Ofﬁce Developer Center at http:  msdn.microsoft.com ofﬁce .

Unlike  Windows  Forms  in  the  .NET Framework, VB6 forms lack the   property. Thus, we must resort to  using  a  pair  of  API-based  helper  functions  to  obtain  the  horizontal  and vertical border widths of the form—that is, the difference between the exter- nal width and height of the form and the width and height of the client area of the form.  ClientSize  Private Declare Function GetSystemMetrics Lib "user32"               ByVal nIndex As Long  As Long Private Const SM_CYCAPTION = 4 Private Const SM_CYFRAME = 33 Private Const SM_CYMENU = 15  Function GetFormExtraWidth     GetFormExtraWidth = GetSystemMetrics SM_CYFRAME  * 2 End Function  Function GetFormExtraHeight     GetFormExtraHeight = GetSystemMetrics SM_CYCAPTION  +               GetSystemMetrics SM_CYFRAME  * 2  End Function  Note that if we happen to have a menu bar across the top of our form,  GetFormExtraHeight   would become  Function GetFormExtraHeight     GetFormExtraHeight = GetSystemMetrics SM_CYCAPTION  +              GetSystemMetrics SM_CYMENU  +               GetSystemMetrics SM_CYFRAME  * 2  End Function  To ensure that the form gets resized whenever the control is resized, we   event  of  the  QuickTime  Control  and  compute  a  SizeChanged  intercept  the  new width and height for the form:  Visual Basic 6  303                                       Private Sub QTControl1_SizeChanged ByVal Width As Long,             ByVal Height As Long         Dim w As Long, h As Long    'Ignore if control was resized as a result of form being resized   If m_bExternalSizeChange Then Exit Sub    'Resize window to wrap control   w =  Width + GetFormExtraWidth    * Screen.TwipsPerPixelX   h =  Height + GetFormExtraHeight    * Screen.TwipsPerPixelY        Me.Move Me.Left, Me.Top, w, h  End Sub  Responding to Manual Resize of the Form  Lastly, in this whirlwind guide to using the QuickTime Control in VB6, we will look at what it takes to add support for resizing the movie in response to Form_Resize manual resizing of the form. The starting point, of course, is the  event handler that gets called anytime the form is resized. In this routine we resize the control to ﬁt snugly inside the newly resized form. First, though, we must temporarily switch the   mode of the QuickTime Control so that the movie is resized to ﬁt the control. Having resized the control—and consequently the movie—we restore the    mode to what it was:  Sizing  Sizing  Private Sub Form_Resize      Dim oldSizingMode As QTSizingModeEnum   Dim w As Long, h As Long        'Lock out SizeChanged handling while we resize the control   m_bExternalSizeChange = True        'Movie resized to fit control   oldSizingMode = QTControl1.Sizing   QTControl1.Sizing = qtMovieFitsControl   w = Me.Width -  GetFormExtraWidth   * Screen.TwipsPerPixelX    h = Me.Height -  GetFormExtraHeight   * Screen.TwipsPerPixelY   304  Appendix B   Additional COM Host Environments                                                                         QTControl1.Move 0, 0, w, h   QTControl1.Sizing = oldSizingMode        m_bExternalSizeChange = False      End Sub  , to ensure that   m_bExternalSizeChange  QTControl1_ Note  the  use  of  the  SizeChanged  events from the control are ignored while   does its thing.

You will  of  course  have  to  alter  any  Windows  Forms–related  code  to  use  VB6 forms and controls. Any delegate-based event handlers in the .NET code will have to be recast in the more traditional VB6 connection point format.  Watch out also for the following common differences in the code itself:   cid:2   In VB6 VBA, assignment of object references   must   use the   Set   keyword:  'VB.NET Dim mov as QTMovie mov = AxQTControl1.Movie  'VB6 VBA Dim mov as QTMovie Set mov = QTControl1.Movie  'VB.NET Dim n as Long = 0  'VB6 VBA Dim n as Long n = 0   cid:2   In  VB6 VBA,  you  cannot  initialize  a  variable  at  the  same  time  that  you define it:  Visual Basic 6  305                                                                                cid:2   String concatenation using the convenient  in VB6 or VBA:  +=   shortcut is not legal syntax  'VB.NET Dim msg as String = "" msg += "this is legal"  'VB6 VBA Dim msg as String msg = "" msg = msg + "this is more long-winded"  Delphi  Borland’s Delphi is a popular Rapid Application Development  RAD  envi- ronment of long standing, and its support for COM components has always been excellent. Current incarnations support C and C C++ as well as the traditional Object Pascal–based Delphi programming language.  The following sample is based on Delphi 6 and 7, which remain popular with many developers, not least because Borland captured their hearts with a free  with registration  Personal Edition. The sample code is available from  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples Delphi  Getting Started  Before we can use the QuickTime Control in Delphi, we must add it to the Component Palette. To do this   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   TQTControl   from the list.   Choose Component  Import ActiveX Control… Select  Apple QuickTime Control 2.0  Version 1.0  should appear in the list of class names. Make sure ActiveX is selected as the Palette page  tab  in which the con- trol will appear. Click Install… and, in the Install window, either select an existing pack- age into which the control will be installed or create a new package. Click OK, and then Yes when asked if you want to rebuild the package. This will generate Delphi wrappers for the QuickTime Control  QTOCon- trolLib  and QuickTime Objects  QTOLibrary  type libraries.  306  Appendix B   Additional COM Host Environments                               cid:2    cid:2   Once the package is rebuilt, close the Package window. If you choose the ActiveX tab on the Component Palette, the QuickTime Control icon should now be there.  Now the QuickTime Control can be added to a form just as you would any other Delphi control. The default name given to the control when added to a form is   QTControl1  .  Loading a Movie  Add an Open Dialog control  OpenDialog1  and a Load button  ButtonLoad  to the form  Figure B.2 , and we can quickly put the QuickTime Control to work loading a movie:  procedure TForm1.ButtonLoadClick Sender: TObject ; begin    QTControl1.ErrorHandling := qtErrorHandlingRaiseException;   if OpenDialog1.Execute then   begin     try       QTControl1.URL := OpenDialog1.FileName;     except       on E: Exception do ShowMessage 'Unable to load Movie!' +              1310 + E.Message ;     end;   end;  end;  As always, when setting the URL property, it is advisable to guard against a  possible load error—in this case using a try...except block.  Unfortunately,  when  you  attempt  to  load  a  movie,  this  may  fail  with  a ﬂoating-point exception. This is a known problem with the way Delphi uses the ﬂoating-point unit  FPU . Delphi expects the FPU to be in a certain state and  when  an  external  library—such  as  QuickTime  or  DirectX—alters  this state, it can cause an exception on return. If you run into this problem, the easiest work-around is simply to disable ﬂoating-point exceptions when you create the form and reenable them when the form is destroyed:  Delphi  307   Figure B.2 The QuickTime Control on a Delphi form.  var   Form1:        TForm1;   Saved8087CW:  Word;  ...  procedure TForm1.FormCreate Sender: TObject ; begin   Saved8087CW := Default8087CW;      Disable FPU exceptions   Set8087CW $133f ; end;  procedure TForm1.FormDestroy Sender: TObject ; begin      Restore FPU exceptions   Set8087CW Saved8087CW ; end;  Playing the Movie  To play and stop the movie, we can add another Play Stop button  Button- PlayStop :  308 Appendix B Additional COM Host Environments   procedure TForm1.ButtonPlayStopClick Sender: TObject ; var   mov: QTMovie; begin    mov := QTControl1.Movie;    if mov   nil then   begin     if  mov.Rate > 0  then       mov.Stop     else       mov.Play 1 ;   end end;  But before we can declare a mov variable of type QTMovie, we must add a reference  to  the  QuickTime  Objects  library   QTOLibrary_TLB   to  the  uses clause of our form:  uses   Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Variants, Classes, Graphics,              Controls, Forms,   Dialogs, StdCtrls, OleCtrls, QTOControlLib_TLB, QTOLibrary_TLB;  Note that the reference to the QuickTime Control  QTOControlLib_TLB  was added  automatically  when  we  placed  a  control  on  the  form:  we  just  add QTOLibrary_TLB after it.  Handling QuickTime Events  Enhancing our load procedure to register for notiﬁcations when the play rate is about to change is simple:  QTControl1.URL := OpenDialog1.FileName; if  QTControl1.Movie   nil  then begin   QTControl1.Movie.EventListeners.Add qtEventClassStateChange,             qtEventRateWillChange, 0, 0 ; end;  Delphi 309   But, for this to be of any use, we must handle the resulting QTEvent events that will be ﬁred by the QuickTime Control. If you locate QTControl1 in the Delphi Object Inspector and click on the Events tab, you should see QTEvent. Double-clicking in the adjacent empty box in the right-hand column should generate  a  skeleton  event  handler  to  which  we  can  add  our  speciﬁc  event handling code:  procedure TForm1.QTControl1QTEvent Sender: TObject;              EventClass, EventID, Phase: Integer;              const EventObject: IQTEventObject;              var Cancel: WordBool ; var   vRate : Variant; begin    case EventID of     qtEventRateWillChange:       begin          vRate := EventObject.GetParam qtEventParamMovieRate ;         Label1.Caption := 'Rate changed: ' + VarToStr vRate ;        if vRate = 0 then          ButtonPlayStop.Caption := 'Play'       else         ButtonPlayStop.Caption := 'Stop';       end;      end;   end;  end.  For  qtEventRateWillChange,  the  rate  parameter  is  extracted  from  the  EventObject and used to set the state of the Play Stop button.  310 Appendix B Additional COM Host Environments   ATL WTL  The  Active  Template  Library   ATL   is  a  suite  of  lightweight  C++  template classes originally released by Microsoft to facilitate the development of COM objects, including ActiveX controls and automation server applications. The existence in ATL of useful window and dialog classes, together with its light- weight wrapper classes for many Windows controls, has led to the adoption of ATL as a popular lightweight alternative to Microsoft Foundation Classes  MFC  for application development. Visual Studio includes a number of ATL Wizards that generate skeleton ATL projects as well as ATL objects such as dialogs and COM components.  The  Windows  Template  Library   WTL   is  an  extension  of  ATL  that  has been  released  into  the  public  domain  by  Microsoft  under  the  open-source Common  Public  License.  The  SourceForge  WTL  project  continues  to  be actively updated and can be found at  http:  sourceforge.net projects wtl   If your requirement is to develop a Windows C++ application that uses the QuickTime Control, and you are looking for a productive Win32 frame- work without the overhead of MFC or similar monolithic frameworks, then ATL WTL is certainly worth a serious look.  This sample project is available on the website at  www.skylark.ie qt4.net Samples ATL  Getting Started  say, Vireo.   cid:2  In Visual Studio .NET, create a new ATL Project and call it something—   cid:2  When  the  ATL  Project  Wizard  appears,  click  on  Application  Settings  as  shown in Figure B.3:  cid:2  uncheck Attributed  cid:2  select Executable  EXE  as the server type  cid:2  click Finish to generate a skeleton ATL application  ATL WTL 311   Figure B.3 Application Settings in ATL Project Wizard.  Figure B.4 Using the ATL Dialog Wizard.  Now  we’ll  add  the  dialog  class  that  we  will  use  to  host  the  QuickTime  Control.   cid:2  Make sure you have selected the Vireo project in Solution Explorer and   cid:2  Select ATL Dialog from the class templates and click Open to launch the  choose Project  Add Class…  ATL Dialog Wizard  Figure B.4 .  dialog class called CMainDialog.   cid:2  In the Short name field, enter “MainDialog” and click Finish to create a   cid:2  Open the dialog in the Resource View—it will be called IDD_MAINDIALOG—  and resize it, making it a good deal bigger.  312 Appendix B Additional COM Host Environments    cid:2  Open  Vireo.cpp,  which  contains  the  main  application  module  class—  CVireoModule—that inherits from CAtlExeModuleT.  cid:2  include “MainDialog.h”  cid:2  add a global variable m_dlg of type CMainDialog To open our dialog when the application launches, we override PreMes-  sageLoop and call m_dlg.DoModal  . The completed Vireo.cpp follows:     Vireo.cpp : Implementation of WinMain  include    "stdafx.h" include    "resource.h" include    "Vireo.h" include    "MainDialog.h"  CMainDialog m_dlg;  class CVireoModule : public CAtlExeModuleT  { public :   DECLARE_LIBID LIBID_VireoLib    DECLARE_REGISTRY_APPID_RESOURCEID IDR_VIREO,      "{430FF806-AE25-40F0-87F9-B3C7BC9EE021}"     HRESULT PreMessageLoop int nShowCmd    {     HRESULT hr = S_OK;     hr = CAtlExeModuleT ::PreMessageLoop nShowCmd ;     if  FAILED hr         return hr;      m_dlg.DoModal  ;      return S_FALSE;   } };  CVireoModule _AtlModule;  ATL WTL 313      extern "C" int WINAPI _tWinMain HINSTANCE  *hInstance* ,              HINSTANCE  *hPrevInstance* , LPTSTR  *lpCmdLine* ,              int nShowCmd  {   return _AtlModule.WinMain nShowCmd ; }  At  this  point,  before  we  go  anywhere  near  QuickTime,  take  a  moment  to build  and  run  the  application.  The  dialog  should  open,  and  clicking  OK should dismiss it.  Adding the QuickTime Control  Before  we  can  use  the  QuickTime  Control  and  QuickTime  objects  in  our ATL  application,  we  need  to  import  the  QTOControlLib  and  QTOLibrary type libraries. This is most easily done by adding the following imports at the end of stdafx.h:     Import QT control and library typelibs import "libid:29866AED-1E14-417D-BA0F-1A2BE6F5A19E"              no_namespace named_guids  import "libid:7b92f833-027d-402b-bff9-a67697366f4e"             no_namespace named_guids   This will ensure that all the classes, types, and enumerations in these type libraries will be available in our application.  Next we turn our attention to the dialog in which we want to create an instance  of  the  QuickTime  Control  and  load  a  movie.  ATL  helps  us  enor- mously here by providing the CAxWindow class as a window class speciﬁcally for hosting ActiveX controls. We add a member variable to CMainDialog to host the control:  CAxWindow m_winAx;  There are three steps to the process of instantiating the QuickTime Control:  1. Use  CAxWindow::Create  to  create  the  host  window  for  the  control  as  a  child window of CMainDialog.  314 Appendix B Additional COM Host Environments   2. Create the instance of the QuickTime Control using CAxWindow::Create-  ControlEx.  3. Retrieve  an  interface  pointer  to IQTControl  using  CAxWindow::QueryCon-  trol so that we can use it to call functions of the QuickTime Control.  All  of  this  can  be  done  in  the  OnInitDialog  function  that  we  have arranged—in our message map in MainDialog.h—to be called whenever the dialog has just been created:  CAxWindow m_winAx;  LRESULT OnInitDialog UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam,              BOOL& bHandled  {   HRESULT                hr = S_OK;   RECT                   rc;   LPOLESTR               wszQTControlCLSID = NULL;   CComPtr     spQTControl;    CenterWindow ::GetDesktopWindow   ;    GetClientRect &rc ;    StringFromCLSID __uuidof QTControl , &wszQTControlCLSID ;       Create Ax host window for control   if  !m_winAx.Create  *this, rc, _T "" ,              WS_CHILD  WS_VISIBLE  WS_CLIPCHILDREN,              0, IDC_QTCONTROL     {     MessageBox __T "Unable to create host window for control!" ,             __T "Error"  ;     goto bail;   }       Create the control instance   hr = m_winAx.CreateControlEx wszQTControlCLSID, 0, 0, 0 ;   if  FAILED hr     {  ATL WTL 315       MessageBox __T "Unable to create control!" , __T "Error"  ;     goto bail;   }       Get interface pointer to control   hr = m_winAx.QueryControl &spQTControl ;    if  spQTControl    {     spQTControl->put_URL CComBSTR "d:\\quicktime\\movies\\                                   sample.mov"  ;   }  bail:   return 1;  }  IDC_QTCONTROL is the ID that we assign to the QuickTime Control within its parent dialog window. It can be an arbitrary integer but must not clash with the IDs of any other control on the dialog.  Adding a Play Stop Button   cid:2  Open the dialog in the Resource Editor and add a Play button with an ID  of IDC_BTN_PLAY.   cid:2  In  MainDialog.h  add  a  Command  handler  to  the  CMainDialog  message map to direct click events on this button to a handler function, OnClicked- Play  .  COMMAND_HANDLER IDC_BTN_PLAY, BN_CLICKED, OnClickedPlay    cid:2  Add the button-click handler function to CMainDialog:  LRESULT OnClickedPlay WORD wNotifyCode, WORD wID, HWND hWndCtl,              BOOL& bHandled  {   CComPtr     spQTControl;   CComPtr       spMovie;   float                  rate;  316 Appendix B Additional COM Host Environments     if  SUCCEEDED  m_winAx.QueryControl &spQTControl       {     spQTControl->get_Movie &spMovie ;      if  spMovie      {       spMovie->get_Rate &rate ;        if  rate > 0.0          spMovie->Stop  ;       else         spMovie->Play  ;     }   }   return 0; }  Handling Events from the QuickTime Control  In order to be able to handle events from the QuickTime Control in our ATL dialog class, it must become a connection-point sink for events from the con- trol. Several things are necessary to achieve this:  1. An  IDispEventImpl  interface  must  be  added  to  CMainDialog  for  the  _IQTControlEvents dispatch interface of the QuickTime Control.  class CMainDialog :    public CAxDialogImpl ,   public IDispEventImpl<IDC_QTCONTROL, CMainDialog,              &DIID__IQTControlEvents, &LIBID_QTOControlLib, 1, 0>  2. A sink map must be declared to map events to their respective handlers.  BEGIN_SINK_MAP CMainDialog    SINK_ENTRY_EX IDC_QTCONTROL, DIID__IQTControlEvents, 1,              OnQTEvent    SINK_ENTRY_EX IDC_QTCONTROL, DIID__IQTControlEvents, 2,              OnQTControlSizeChanged  END_SINK_MAP    ATL WTL 317   Notice that the control identiﬁer IDC_QTCONTROL is used both here and in the IDispEventImpl interface declaration.  3. The connection points need to be set up or advised. This can be done after  the QuickTime Control has been instantiated:     Set up _IQTControlEvents connection point AdviseSinkMap this, TRUE ;  4. The connection point should really be unadvised when we close the dialog,  and this can be done in a WM_DESTROY handler:  LRESULT OnDestroy UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam,              BOOL& bHandled  {     Unadvise the connection points   AdviseSinkMap FALSE ;   return 1; }  Don’t forget to add WM_DESTROY to the message map in MainDialog.h:  MESSAGE_HANDLER WM_DESTROY, OnDestroy   And,  of  course,  we  mustn’t  forget  the  event  handler.  It  must  use  the __stdcall calling convention:     Sink handler for SizeChanged event void __stdcall OnQTControlSizeChanged long width, long height  {   ATLTRACE _T "CMainDialog::OnQTControlSizeChanged: %d, %d\n" ,             width, height ; }  QuickTime Events  To  receive  QuickTime  events,  we  must  register  event  listeners  with  the movie. This can easily be done once the movie is loaded:  318 Appendix B Additional COM Host Environments   spQTControl->put_URL  CComBSTR "d:\\quicktime\\movies\\             sample.mov"   ;  CComPtr              spMovie; CComPtr     spEventListeners;  spQTControl->get_Movie &spMovie ;  if  spMovie  {   spMovie->get_EventListeners &spEventListeners ;   if  spEventListeners      spEventListeners->Add qtEventClassStateChange,              qtEventRateWillChange ; }  The  following  QTEvent  handler  demonstrates  how  to  access  the  event  parameters:     Sink handler for QTEvent event void __stdcall OnQTEvent long EventClass, long EventID, long Phase,              IQTEventObject* EventObject, VARIANT_BOOL* Cancel  {   CComVariant var;   CComPtr  event = EventObject;    switch  EventID    {     case qtEventRateWillChange:        var = event->GetParam qtEventParamMovieRate ;       ATLTRACE _T "Play Rate %f\n" , var.fltVal ;   } }  These brief introductions to using the QuickTime Control in Visual Basic 6, Delphi, and ATL WTL should provide you with a useful starting point for your own development. With a little bit of effort, many of the code samples in this book can be adapted to any of these development environments.
