DECADE  has seen an increased interest in website performance, with businesses of all  sizes realizing that even modest changes in page loading times can have a signifi cant effect on their   profi ts. The move toward a faster web has been driven largely by Yahoo! and Google, which have  both carried out extensive research on the subject of website performance, and have worked hard to  make web masters aware of the benefi ts.  This book provides valuable information that you must know about website performance   optimization —  from database replication and web server load balancing, to JavaScript profi ling  and the latest features of Cascading Style Sheets 3  CSS3 . You can discover  perhaps surprising   ways in which your website is under-performing, and learn how to scale out your system as the  popularity of your site increases.  WHY SPEED IS IMPORTANT  At fi rst glance, it may seem as if website loading speeds aren’t terribly important. Of course, it puts  off users if they must wait 30 seconds for your page to load. But if loading times are relatively low,  isn’t that enough? Does shaving off a couple of seconds from loading times actually make that much  of a difference? Numerous pieces of research have been carried out on this subject, and the results  are quite surprising.   In 2006, Google experimented with reducing the size of its Maps homepage  from 100 KB to  70–80 KB . Within a week, traffi c had increased by 10 percent, according to ZDNet  http:  www .zdnet.com blog btl googles-marissa-mayer-speed-wins 3925?p=3925 . Google also found  that a half-second increase in loading times for search results had led to a 20 percent drop in sales.  That same year, Amazon.com came to similar conclusions, after experiments showed that for each  100-millisecond increase in loading time, sales dropped by 1 percent  http:  ai.stanford .edu ~ronnyk IEEEComputer2007OnlineExperiments.pdf .   The fact that there is a correlation between speed and sales perhaps isn’t too surprising, but the  extent to which even a tiny difference in loading times can have such a noticeable impact on sales  certainly is.  But that’s not the only worry. Not only do slow websites lose traffi c and sales, work at Stanford  University suggests that slow websites are also considered less credible  http:  captology .stanford.edu pdf p61-fogg.pdf . It seems that, as Internet connections have become faster, the  willingness of users to wait has started to wane. If you want your site to be busy and well liked, it  pays to be fast.  flast.indd   xxiii flast.indd   xxiii  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  If all this weren’t enough, there’s now yet another reason to ensure that your site runs quickly. In  2010, Google announced that loading times would play a role in how it ranked sites —  that is,  faster sites will rank higher  http:  googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com 2010 04  using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html . However, loading times carry a relatively  low weight at the moment, and other factors  relevance, backlinks, and so on  are still much more  important.  Hopefully you are now convinced of the need for speed. So, let’s take a look at some of the reasons  why sites are slow.  Why Sites Are Slow  The most common reason why websites run slowly is that they simply weren’t designed with speed  in mind. Typically, the fi rst step in the creation of a site is for a graphics designer to create templates  based on the ideas of the site owner  who is often not technically minded . The graphic designer’s  main goal is an attractive looking interface regardless of size, and the nontechnical site owner gener- ally wants lots of bells and whistles, again without appreciating the performance impact.  The next step is for a programmer to make things work behind the scenes, which typically involves  a server-side scripting language  such as PHP or Perl  and a back-end database. Sadly, performance  is often low on the programmer’s agenda, too, especially when his or her boss wants to see visible  results fast. It simply isn’t worth the programmer’s time to compress the bloated graphics created by  the designer, or to convert them to sprites.  Another often overlooked fact is that much of the development and testing of a new website will  probably be carried out on a development server under low load. A database query that takes a  couple of seconds to run may not be a problem when the site has only a couple of users. But when  the site goes live, that same query could well slow down the site to a crawl. Tools such as Apache  Benchmark can simulate heavy traffi c.  There is also the issue of caching. Those involved in the creation and development of a site typi- cally already have primed caches.  That is, images and external JavaScript CSS used by the site will  already be cached in their browsers.  This causes the site to load much faster than it would for fi rst- time visitors.  Other factors affecting the speed of a website are connection speed and computer “power.”  Developers typically have powerful computers and a good Internet connection, and it’s easy to for- get that plenty of people  especially in rural locations  still use dial-up modems and computers that  are 10 years old. Care must be taken to ensure that such users are accommodated for.  The Compromise between Functionality and Speed  The creation of a website is often a battle between the designers who want looks and functionality,  and the programmers who want performance.  Sadly, “battle” tends to be a more apt description  than “collaboration.”  Inevitably, some compromises must be made. Both sides tend to be guilty of   xxiv  flast.indd   xxiv flast.indd   xxiv  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  tunnel vision here, but it’s worth trying to develop a rounded view of the situation. Although speed  is important, it’s not the “be all and end all.” In your quest for more and more savings, be wary of  stripping down your website too much.  Scaling Up versus Scaling Out  There are two basic approaches to scaling your website:   ➤ Scaling up  sometimes referred to as scaling vertical  means keeping the same number of   servers but upgrading the server hardware. For example, you may run your whole setup from  a single server. As your site gets more traffi c, you discover that the server is beginning to  struggle, so you throw in another stick of RAM or upgrade the CPU —  which is scaling up.   ➤ With scaling out  also referred to as scaling horizontally , you increase the number of   machines in your setup. For example, in the previous scenario, you could place your data- base on its own server, or use a load balancer to split web traffi c across two web servers.  So, which method is best? You’ll hear a lot of criticism of vertical scaling, but in reality, it is a viable  solution for many. The majority of websites do not achieve overnight success. Rather, the user base  steadily increases over the years. For these sites, vertical scaling is perfectly fi ne. Advances in hard- ware mean that each time you want to upgrade, a machine with more CPU cores, or more memory,  or faster disks will be available.  Scaling up isn’t without its problems, though. You pay a premium for top-of-the-range hardware.  The latest monster server will usually cost more than two mid-range servers with the same overall  power. Also, additional CPU cores and RAM don’t tend to result in a linear increase in perfor- mance. For example, no matter how much RAM you have, access to it is still along a fi xed-width  bus, which can transfer only at a fi nite rate. Additional CPU cores aren’t a great benefi t if your bot- tleneck is with a single-threaded application. So, scaling up offers diminishing returns, and it also  fails to cope when your site goes stratospheric. For that, you need a topology where you can easily  add additional mid-range servers to cope with demand.  Scaling out is trickier, because it involves more planning. If you have a pool of web servers, you  must think about how sessions are handled, user uploads, and so on. If you split your database over  several machines, you must worry about keeping data in sync. Horizontal scaling is the best long- term solution, but it requires more thought as to how to make your setup scalable.  Finally, be wary of taking the idea of horizontal scaling to extremes. Some people take the idea  too far, setting up clusters of Pentium I machines because “that’s how Google does it.” Actually,  Google doesn’t do this. Although Google scales out to a high degree, it still uses decent hardware  on each node.   Scaling out isn’t without its drawbacks either. Each additional node means extra hardware  to  monitor and replace, and time spent installing and deploying code. The most satisfactory   arrangement tends to be through a combination of scaling up and scaling out.  flast.indd   xxv flast.indd   xxv  xxv  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  The Dangers of Premature Optimization  There’s a famous quote by Donald Knuth, author of the legendary The Art of Computer  Programming  Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Professional, 2011 . “Premature optimization is the  root of all evil,” he said, and this is often re-quoted in online discussions as a means of dismissing  another user’s attempts at more marginal optimizations. For example, if one developer is contem- plating writing his or her PHP script as a PHP extension in C, the Knuth quote will invariably be  used to dispute that idea.  So, what exactly is wrong with premature optimization? The fi rst danger is that it adds complex- ity to your code, and makes it more diffi cult to maintain and debug. For example, imagine that you  decided to rewrite some of your C code in assembly for optimal performance. It’s easy to fall into  the trap of not seeing the forest for the trees —  you become so focused on the performance of one  small aspect of the system that you lose perspective on overall performance. You may be wasting  valuable time on relatively unimportant areas —  there may be much bigger and easier gains to be  made elsewhere.  So, it’s generally best to consider optimization only after you already have a good overview of how  the whole infrastructure  hardware, operating system, databases, web servers, and so on  will fi t  together. At that point, you will be in a better position to judge where the greatest gains can be made.  That’s not to say you should ignore effi ciency when writing your code. The Knuth quote is often mis- used because it can be diffi cult to say what constitutes premature optimization, and what is simply  good programming practice. For example, if your application will be reading a lot of information  from the database, you may decide that you will write some basic caching to wrap around these calls,  to cut down on load on the database.   Does this count as premature optimization? It’s certainly premature in the sense that you don’t even  know if these database calls will be a signifi cant bottleneck, and it is adding an extra degree of com- plexity to your code. But could it not also be classed as simply planning with scalability in mind?  Building in this caching from the outset will be quicker  and probably better integrated  than hacking  it in at a later date.  If you’re tempted to optimize prematurely, stop and consider these two points:   ➤ Will there defi nitely be a benefi t —  and will it be a signifi cant one?   ➤ Will it make the code signifi cantly more diffi cult to maintain or debug?  If the answers are “yes” and “no,” respectively, you should optimize.  Time Is Money  Optimizing is a satisfactory experience —  so much so that you may fi nd yourself attempting opti- mization for the sake of it, rather than because it is needed. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Research has shown that even tiny increases in page loading times can have an impact on revenue  and user experience, so optimization doesn’t have to be a case of passively responding to complaints  about speed. But time is also money, and sometimes simply throwing extra hardware at the problem   xxvi  flast.indd   xxvi flast.indd   xxvi  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  is the best solution. Is spending the best part of a week trying to perform further optimizations the  right move, or would spending $100 on a RAM upgrade be just as effective? The latter option seems  like a cop-out but is probably the most cost-effective route.  TOOLS OF THE TRADE  Waterfall Views  The bottlenecks in an application don’t always occur where you might expect them to, and an  important precursor to optimization is to spend time watching how the application runs.  Waterfall views are extremely useful when looking at the front end of a website. These are graphs  showing the order in which the browser is requesting resources, and the time that it takes each  resource to download. Most waterfall tools also show things like the time spent for domain name  service  DNS  lookups, for establishing a TCP connection to the web server, for parsing and render- ing data, and so on.  There are a lot of waterfall tools out there —  some run in your browser; others are websites into  which you enter the URL that you want to check. But many have subtle fl aws. For example, one  popular online tool will request any resources contained in commented-out Hypertext Markup  Language  HTML  such as the following:  <!--   ->  Web browsers have the sense to ignore such links, so this tool will give a distorted view of the page  loading process. Another well-known online tool will fetch all the resources  images and fonts   referenced in the style sheet, even if the selectors containing them are not used in the HTML docu- ment. Again, in practice, web browsers are smart enough not to make this mistake.  WebPageTest.org  By far, the best online waterfall tool is probably WebPageTest.org  commonly known as WPT ,  developed by Google, AOL, and others. It offers dozens of locations around the world from which to  perform tests and has an impressive list of browsers to test in —  from Internet Explorer 6 through  to 10, to iPhone, Firefox, and Chrome. Figure I-1 shows WPT in action.  Figure I-1 shows the results page for http:  www.google.com. The six images at the top right  indicate how the site scored in what WPT determined to be the six key areas. Remember that this is  just a summary for quick reference and should not be taken as an absolute. For instance, in the test,  google.com scored an “F” for “Cache static content,” yet it is still well optimized. Clicking any of  these scores will give a breakdown of how the grade was determined.  flast.indd   xxvii flast.indd   xxvii  xxvii  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  FIGURE I-2  xxviii  FIGURE I-1  The way in which a page loads can vary dramatically, depending on whether the user’s cache  is primed  that is, if the user has previously visited the site . Some static resources  such as CSS,  JavaScript, images, and so on  may already be in the browser cache, signifi cantly speeding things up.  So, the default is for WPT to perform a First View test  that is, as the browser would see the target  site if it had an unprimed cache , and a Repeat View test  that is, emulating the effect of visiting  the site with an already primed cache . A preview image is shown for both these tests, and clicking  one brings up the full waterfall graphic, as shown in Figure I-2.  flast.indd   xxviii flast.indd   xxviii  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  The horizontal bar shows time elapsed  with resources listed vertically, in the order in which they  were requested . So, the browser fi rst fetched the index page    , then chrome-48.png, then logo3w .png, and so on. Figure I-3 shows the fi rst half second in more detail.   FIGURE I-3  The section at the beginning of the fi rst request indicates a DNS lookup —  the browser must  resolve www.google.com to an IP address. This took approximately 50 milliseconds. The next  section indicates the time taken to establish a connection to the web server. This includes setting  up the TCP connection  if you’re unfamiliar with the three-way handshake, see Appendix A, “TCP  Performance” , and possibly waiting for the web server to spawn a new worker process to handle the  request. In this example, that took approximately 70 milliseconds.  The next section shows the time to fi rst byte  TTFB . At the beginning of this section, the client has  issued the request and is waiting for the server to respond. There’ll always be a slight pause here   approximately 120 milliseconds in this example , even for static fi les. However, high delays often  indicate an overloaded server —  perhaps high levels of disk contention, or back-end scripts that are  taking a long time to generate the page.  Finally, the server returns a response to the client, which is shown by the fi nal section of the bar.  The size of this section is dependent on the size of the resource being returned and the available  bandwidth. The number following the bar is the total time for the resource, from start to fi nish.  After the web browser fetches the HTML document, it can begin fetching resources linked to in it.  Note that in request 2, there is no DNS lookup —  the browser already has the response cached. For  request 5, the resource resides on a subdomain, ssl.gstatic.com, so this does incur a DNS lookup.  Also notice two vertical lines at approximately the 40-millisecond and 55-millisecond marks. The  fi rst line indicates the point at which the browser began to render the page. The second line indi- cates the point at which the onLoad event fi red —  that is, the point at which the page had fi nished  loading.  You’ll learn more about these waterfall views later in this book —  you’ll learn how to optimize the  downloading order, why some of the requests have a connection overhead and others don’t, and  why there are sometimes gaps where nothing seems to be happening.  Firebug  The downside to WPT is that it shows how the page loads on a remote machine, not your own.  Usually, this isn’t a problem, but occasionally you want to test a URL inside a members-only area,   flast.indd   xxix flast.indd   xxix  xxix  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  or see the page as it would look for someone in your country  or on your ISP . WPT does actually  support some basic scripting, allowing it to log in to htpasswd-protected areas, but this isn’t any  help if you want to log in to something more complicated.  Firebug is a useful Firefox extension that  among other things  can show a waterfall view as a page  loads in your browser. This is perhaps a more accurate portrayal of real-world performance if you’re  running on a modestly powered PC with home broadband because the WPT tests are presumably  conducted from quite powerful and well-connected hardware.  The output of Firebug is similar to that of WPT, complete with the two vertical lines representing  the start and end of rendering. Each resource can be clicked to expand a list of the headers sent and  received with the request.  System Monitoring  This book is intended to be platform-neutral. Whether you run Berkeley Software Distribution   BSD , Linux, Solaris, Windows, OS X, or some other operating system, the advice given in this  book should still be applicable.   Nevertheless, for system performance-monitoring tools, this will inevitably be quite platform- specifi c. Some tools such as netstat are implemented across most operating systems, but the likes  of vmstat and iostat exist only in the UNIX world, and Windows users must use other tools. Let’s  briefl y look at the most common choices to see how they work.  vmstat  vmstat is an essential tool on most fl avors of UNIX and its derivatives  Linux, OS X, and so on .  It provides information on memory usage, disk activity, and CPU utilization. With no arguments,  vmstat simply displays a single-line summary of system activity. However, a numeric value is usu- ally specifi ed on the command line, causing vmstat to output data every x seconds. Here’s vmstat  in action with an interval of 5 seconds:   vmstat 5 procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----  r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs  us sy id wa  4  0  28528 355120 160112 4283728    0    0     0     0    0    0 20  2 75  4  4  0  28528 353624 160124 4283764    0    0     0   106  817 1303 28  1 71  0  1  0  28528 358008 160128 4283808    0    0     0  1354  926 1511 28  1 71  0  2  0  28528 351380 160132 4283828    0    0     0   167  757 1428 30  1 69  0  2  0  28528 356360 160136 4283940    0    0     0  1309  864 1420 26  1 72  0  3  0  28528 355552 160140 4284012    0    0    10   133  823 1573 37  1 61  0  5  0  28528 349416 160144 4284092    0    0     5  1598  918 1746 30  1 68  0  3  0  28528 353144 160152 4284116    0    0    14    82  791 1301 24  1 74  0  1  0  28528 355076 160156 4284344    0    0    13  1242  839 1803 27  1 71  1  xxx  flast.indd   xxx flast.indd   xxx  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  The fi rst columns are as follows:   ➤ r —  This is the number of currently running processes.   ➤ b —  This is the number of blocking processes.   Blocking processes are those that cannot yet run because they are waiting on the hardware  most  often the disks . Naturally, this is the least-desirable state for a process to be in, and a high number  of blocking processes generally indicates a bottleneck somewhere  again, usually the disks . If the  number of running processes exceeds the number of CPU cores on the system, this can also cause  some degrading of performance, but blocking is the real killer.  The next four columns are similar to the information given by the free command, as shown here:    ➤ swpd —  This is how much swap memory is in use  expressed in bytes .   ➤ free —  This is idle memory.   ➤ buff —  This is memory used for buffers.   ➤ cache —  This is memory used for caching.  The next two columns show swap usage:   ➤ si —  This is the bytes read in from swap.   ➤ so —  This is the bytes written out to swap.  If you’re coming to UNIX from the world of Windows, it’s worth taking some time to ensure that  you are absolutely clear on what these fi gures mean —  in UNIX, things aren’t as clear-cut as “free”  and “used” memory.  Swapping is usually a bad thing, no matter what operating system you use. It indicates insuffi cient  physical memory. If swapping occurs, expect to see high numbers of blocking processes as the CPUs  wait on the disks.  Following are the next two columns:   ➤ bi —  This is the bytes read from block devices.   ➤ bo —  This is the bytes written to block devices.   Invariably, block devices means hard disks, so these two columns show how much data is being read  from and written to disk. With disks so often being a bottleneck, it’s worth studying these columns  with the goal of trying to reduce disk activity. Often, you’ll be surprised just how much writing is  going on.   NOTE   For a breakdown of which disks and partitions the activity occurs on, see  the iostat command.  flast.indd   xxxi flast.indd   xxxi  xxxi  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  Now, consider the next two columns:   ➤ in —  This is the number of CPU interrupts.   ➤ cs —  This is the number of context switches.  At the risk of digressing too much into CPU architecture, a context switch occurs when the CPU  either switches from one process to another, or handles an interrupt. Context switching is an   essential part of multitasking operating systems but also incurs some slight overhead. If your  system performs a huge number of context switches, this can degrade performance.  The fi nal four columns show CPU usage, measured as a percentage of the CPU time:   ➤ us —  This is the time spent running userland code.   ➤ sy —  This is the system time  that is, time spent running kernel code .   ➤ id —  This shows the idle time.  That is, the CPU is doing nothing.    ➤ wa —  This shows the time that the CPU is waiting on I O.  id  idle  is naturally the most preferable state to be in, whereas wa  waiting  is the least. wa indicates  that the CPU has things to do but can’t because it’s waiting on other hardware. Usually, this is the  disks, so check for high values in the io and swap columns.   Whether the CPU will mostly be running user code or kernel code depends on the nature of the appli- cations running on the machine. Many of the applications discussed in this book spend a lot of time  sending and receiving data over the network, and this is usually implemented at the kernel level.   The previous vmstat example was taken from a web server at a fairly quiet time of the day. Let’s  look at another example, taken from the same server, while the nightly backup process was running:   vmstat 5 procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----  r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa  1  1  26968 330260 161320 4328812    0    0     0     0    0    0 20  2 75  4  4  0  26968 234492 160988 4370996    0    0  5329  6415 1041 3678 25  3 63  8  1  1  26968 238424 158284 4377120    0    0  4729  5066 1035 2128 18  2 71  9  0  2  27020 255812 150904 4386456    0    0  8339 14990 1169 1987 25  2 64  8  1  6  27992 254028 142544 4366768    0   53 10026 13558 1194 3906 44  5 35 15  4  0  27992 261516 138572 4384876    0    0  7706 17494 1081 2029 41  4 39 16  1  1  31648 277228 131832 4374340    0    0 10300 17186 1127 2262 31  3 58  9  1  2  31648 280524 130676 4385072    0    0  3330  5765  915 2059 23  2 68  6  0  1  31648 282496 130220 4385120    0    0  2096  1918  934 1474 21  1 68 10  Although the machine is far from being overloaded, performance is not ideal. You see regular block- ing processes, disk activity is higher, and the CPUs  this machine had six cores  are spending more  of their time in the waiting  wa  state.   xxxii  flast.indd   xxxii flast.indd   xxxii  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  Depending on your operating system, there may be other data available from vmstat. For example,  the Linux version can give a more detailed breakdown of disk activity  with the –d switch  and can  show statistics on forking  with the –f switch . Check the man pages to see exactly what your system  supports.  perfmon  On Windows, the Performance Monitor  perfmon  shown in Figure I-4 provides similar information.   FIGURE I-4  Don’t underestimate the power of perfmon. The default provides a wealth of information and can be  extended to show all manner of additional data.   WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR  The information in this book is designed to appeal to a wide range of readers, from system   administrators charged with managing busy websites, to web developers looking to write effi cient,  high-performance code.   This book makes no assumptions about your underlying operating system, and the information is   in most cases  equally applicable whether you run OS X, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, or another   fl avor of UNIX. Situations are highlighted in which some of the information depends on the   operating system used.  flast.indd   xxxiii flast.indd   xxxiii  xxxiii  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  WHAT THIS BOOK COVERS  A wide range of technologies are in use on the web, and it would be futile to attempt to cover them  all  or at least cover them in suffi cient detail . Rather, the discussions in this book concentrate on the  most popular open source technologies —  PHP, MySQL, Apache, Nginx, memcache, and mongodb.  In this book, you’ll discover many of the advanced features of these technologies, and the ways  in which they can be utilized to provide scalable, high-performance websites. You’ll learn cur- rent  performance best practices, tips for improving your existing sites, and how to design with   scalability in mind.  The browser market is wide and varied. The discussions in this book focus on the fi ve main web  browsers  which together make up the vast majority of web users   —   Internet Explorer, Chrome,  Firefox, Opera, and Safari. Behavior can vary in suitable  but important  ways between versions,  and, in most cases, when particular aspects of browser behavior are examined, the discussion  includes versions from the past 5 years or so. It’s unfortunate  but inevitable  that a sizeable number  of users will not be running the most current version.  HOW THIS BOOK IS STRUCTURED  The book is divided into two parts, covering aspects of website performance related to the front end   Part I  and the back end  Part II .   In the fi rst part you’ll meet topics such as the HTTP protocol, how web browsers work, browser  caching, content compression, minifi cation, JavaScript, CSS, and web graphics —  all essential topics  for web developers. Following are the chapters included in this part of the book:   ➤ Chapter 1, “A Refresher on Web Browsers” —  This chapter provides a look under the hood  at how the web works. In this chapter, you will meet the HTTP protocol, and features such  as caching, persistent connections, and Keep-Alive.   ➤ Chapter 2, “Utilizing Client-Side Caching” —   This chapter examines the ways in which   web browsers cache content, and what you can do to control it.   ➤ Chapter 3, “Content Compression” —   Here you fi nd everything you need to know about   compressing content to speed up page loading times.    ➤ Chapter 4, “Keeping the Size Down with Minifi cation” —   In this chapter, you discover the   art of minifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to further reduce payload sizes.   ➤ Chapter 5, “Optimizing Web Graphics and CSS” —   Here you learn how to optimize the  most common image formats, and discover ways in which CSS can be used to create lean,  effi cient markup.   ➤ Chapter 6, “JavaScript, the Document Object Model, and Ajax” —   JavaScript is an increas- ingly important part of the web. In this chapter, you learn about performance aspects of the  language, with an emphasis on interaction with the document object model  DOM .  xxxiv  flast.indd   xxxiv flast.indd   xxxiv  05 11 12   4:57 PM 05 11 12   4:57 PM   INTRODUCTION  The second part of the book focuses on the technologies behind the scenes —  databases, web  servers, server-side scripting, and so on. Although many of these issues are of more interest to back- end developers and system administrators, they are vital for front-end developers to understand to  appreciate the underlying system. Following are the chapters included in this part of the book:   ➤ Chapter 7, “Working with Web Servers” —   This chapter provides everything you need to   know about tuning Apache and Nginx. The second half of the chapter looks at load balanc- ing and related issues that arise  for example, session affi nity .   ➤ Chapter 8, “Tuning MySQL” —   In this fi rst of two chapters devoted to MySQL, you meet   the myriad of tuning options and discover the differences between MyISAM and InnoDB.   ➤ Chapter 9, “MySQL in the Network” —   Here you learn how to scale out MySQL using   such techniques as replication, sharding, and partitioning.   ➤ Chapter 10, “Utilizing NoSQL Solutions” —   NoSQL is a collective term for lightweight  database alternatives. In this chapter, you learn about two of the most important players:  memcache and mongodb.   ➤ Chapter 11, “Working with Secure Sockets Layer  SSL ” —   SSL can be a performance   killer, but there are a surprising number of things that you can do to improve the situation.   ➤ Chapter 12, “Optimizing PHP” —   Perhaps the most popular back-end scripting language,  PHP can have a signifi cant impact on performance. In this chapter, you learn about opcode  caching, and discover how to write lean, effi cient PHP.  This book also includes three appendixes that provide additional information:   ➤ Appendix A, “TCP Performance” —   Transmission control protocol  TCP  and Internet   Protocol  IP  are the protocols that drive in the Internet. In this appendix, you learn about  some of the performance aspects of TCP, including the three-way handshake and Nagle’s  algorithm.   ➤ Appendix B, “Designing for Mobile Platforms” —   An increasing number of users now   access the web via mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets. These bring about their  own design considerations.   ➤ Appendix C, “Compression” —   This book makes numerous references to compression.

Web browsers are one of the most  important  pieces of software in the modern Internet, and competition between vendors is fi erce — so much  so that many vendors have chosen to give their browsers away for free, knowing that an increased  share of the browser market can indirectly reap profi ts in other areas.  Although such competition is good news for consumers, it can be a different story for web  developers, who must strive to make their sites display correctly in the myriad of browsers,  each of which has its own idiosyncrasies and nonstandard behavior. To understand how  this situation has evolved, let’s begin by returning to the early days of the World  Wide Web.  A BRIEF HISTORY OF WEB BROWSERS  Although Mosaic is often thought of as the fi rst web browser to hit the market, this isn’t   actually true — that honor falls on WorldWideWeb, a browser developed by Tim Berners-Lee in  1990 at the same time as he developed the HTTP 0.9 protocol. Other browsers soon followed,  including Erwise, ViolaWWW, MidasWWW, and Cello — with Cello being, at this point, the  only browser for Microsoft Windows. The year 1992 also saw the release of Lynx, the fi rst  text-based browser — the others all utilized graphical user interfaces  GUIs .  c01.indd   3 c01.indd   3  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   4  ❘  CHAPTER 1  A REFRESHER ON WEB BROWSERS  In 1993, Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina created Mosaic. Although Mosaic was not as sophisticated  as its competitors, a lot of effort had gone into making it easy to install. And it had one other big  advantage. Previous browsers had mostly been student projects, and as such, they often fl oundered  after the students graduated. On the other hand, Mosaic had a team of full-time programmers  developing it and offering technical support. Thanks to some clever marketing, Mosaic and the web  were starting to become linked in the minds of the public.  In 1994, a dispute over the naming of Mosaic forced a rebranding, and Netscape Navigator was  born. Unfortunately, regular changes to the licensing terms meant that, for the next few years, there  was ongoing confusion over how free it actually was.  Microsoft entered the market in 1995 with Internet Explorer  IE  1.0, which was also based on  Mosaic, from whom Microsoft had licensed the code. IE 2.0 followed later that year, with IE 3.0  following in 1996. IE 3.0 was notable for introducing support for cascading style sheets  CSS ,  Java, and ActiveX, but Netscape continued to dominate the market, with IE making up only  approximately 10 percent of the market.  Netscape Loses Its Dominance  Over the following years, the market swiftly turned in Microsoft’s favor. By IE 4.0  released in  1997 , Microsoft’s share of the market had increased to 20 percent, and, by the release of IE 5  in 1999, this had risen to 50 percent. Microsoft’s dominance peaked in the fi rst few years of the  twenty-fi rst century, with IE 6.0  released in 2001  claiming more than 80 percent of the  market.  Microsoft’s aggressive marketing included a decision to bundle IE with Windows. But there’s no  denying that, at this point in the late 1990s, IE was simply the better browser. Netscape was prone  to crashing, it was not as fast as IE, and it was beginning to look distinctly old-fashioned.  In an attempt to revive its fortunes, Netscape decided to release the source code for Navigator,  and branded it as Mozilla  also known as Netscape 5 , entrusting it to the newly formed Mozilla  Foundation. Although this was an important turning point in the history of the web, it did little  to help in the immediate future. AOL purchased Netscape, and released Netscape 6 in 2000 and  Netscape 7 in 2002. This failed to halt the downturn, though, and AOL eventually announced the  end of Netscape in 2008, a year after the release of both Netscape 8 and 9  which, ironically, were  now based on Firefox .  The Growth of Firefox  By 2000, it was clear that Microsoft had won the browser wars, and for the next few years, it  enjoyed unchallenged dominance of the market. However, the Mozilla Foundation was still hard  at work. Mozilla 1.0 was released in 2002 but failed to make much of an impact in the Windows  environment.  c01.indd   4 c01.indd   4  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   Inside HTTP  ❘  5  Some Mozilla developers were becoming increasingly unhappy with the direction Mozilla was tak- ing, feeling it was becoming increasingly bloated, and branched off their own port of the Mozilla  code. After several changes to the name, this ultimately became Mozilla Firefox — usually referred  to simply as Firefox.  Firefox 1.0 was released in 2004, but it wasn’t until version 2.0, released 2 years later that things  began to take off. Mozilla marketed Firefox heavily to the everyday user as a faster, more secure  alternative to IE; while bloggers and techies were quick to praise the more advanced features.  Finally, it was felt, there was a worthy rival to IE, and by the end of 2006, Firefox’s share of the  market had risen to 10 percent.  Firefox 3.0 was released in 2008, and by the end of 2010, had a market share of approximately  25 to 30 percent. It’s ironic that just as IE’s early growth was boosted by dissatisfaction among  Netscape users, Firefox’s growth was aided enormously by growing dissatisfaction among IE users.  Indeed, it was felt that, having won the browser war, Microsoft had become somewhat complacent,  with IE 6 and 7 being somewhat insipid.  The Present  Microsoft managed to get back on track with the release of IE 8 in 2008. As well as being compliant  with CSS 2.1 and Acid 2, IE 8 fi nally included tabbed browsing — a feature that had been present in  Opera and Firefox for some time.  In 2011, IE 9 was released, boasting CSS 3 support; improved graphics rendering; and a new  JavaScript engine, Chakra, which was capable of better utilizing multicore CPUs. Also in 2011,  Firefox 4 was released with its own new JavaScript engine  JagerMonkey  and hardware graphics  accelerator.  INSIDE HTTP  Before beginning an examination of optimization techniques, it would be benefi cial to understand  how the web works. The remainder of this chapter recaps the basics of the HyperText Transfer  Protocol  HTTP , discusses the differences between HTTP 1.0 and 1.1  in particular, those relating  to performance , and then follows the steps taken when a browser requests a page — from the initial  domain name service  DNS  look-up through to the rendering. Later chapters revisit these steps in  more detail, and you will learn ways to improve performance.  The HyperText Transfer Protocol  HTTP is the means by which web browsers  clients  communicate with web servers and vice versa.  It’s a text-based protocol operating at the application layer, and, as such, HTTP doesn’t concern  itself with issues such as routing or error checking: This is the job of the lower layers such as trans- mission control protocol  TCP  and Internet Protocol  IP .  c01.indd   5 c01.indd   5  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   6  ❘  CHAPTER 1  A REFRESHER ON WEB BROWSERS  THE OSI MODEL  The Open Systems Interconnection  OSI  model is a commonly used means of rep- resenting the various parts of network traffi c in terms of layers, refl ecting the way  in which encapsulation of data works. The OSI model defi nes seven layers  the older  TCP IP model defi nes just four . The seven layers include the following:    Physical layer  layer one  — This is the underlying means of transmitting the    electrical signal across the network  for example, Ethernet, USB, or Bluetooth .    Data Link layer  layer two  — This sits above the physical layer and provides   transport across it. In the case of Ethernet, the data link layer handles the   construction of Ethernet frames, and communicates with devices via their  Media Access Control  MAC  addresses.     Network Layer  layer three  — This deals with packet routing across more   complicated networks. Internet Protocol  IP  is the most commonly used protocol  at this level, and is capable of traveling across multiple networks, and through  intermediate devices such as routers.     Transport Layer  layer four  — This sits on top of the network layer and provides   higher-level features such as fl ow control and the concept of connections. The  most commonly seen protocols at this level are Transmission Control Protocol   TCP  and User Datagram Protocol  UDP .     Session Layer  layer fi ve  — This handles the management of sessions between  the applications on either side of the network connection. Protocols used at this  layer include NetBios, H.245, and SOCKS.      Presentation Layer  layer six  — This handles the formatting of data. One of the  most common examples is seen in telnet, where differences in the capabilities of  terminals must be accounted for. Here, the presentation layer ensures that you see  the same thing in your telnet session no matter what your terminal capabilities or  character encodings are.     Application Layer  layer seven  — At the top of the OSI model is the application  layer, which contains some of the most well-known protocols, including Simple  Message Transport Protocol  SMTP , HTTP, File Transfer Protocol  FTP , and  Secure Shell  SSH . In many cases, these protocols are plain text  rather than  binary , and are, by their nature, high level.  Instead, HTTP deals with the higher-level requests involved in navigating the web, such as, Fetch  the Index Page from http:  www.google.com or Post This Form Data to the CGI Script at  Such-and-Such.  Navigating to a web page in your browser typically results in a series of HTTP requests being issued  by the client to fetch the resources contained on the page. For each request, the server issues a  response. Usually, the response contains the resource requested, but sometimes it indicates an error   c01.indd   6 c01.indd   6  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   Inside HTTP  ❘  7   such as the infamous 404 Not Found error  or some other message. Let’s take a look at the HTTP  protocol in action.  Using the Live HTTP Headers extension for Firefox, you can watch the HTTP headers that fl ow as  you browse the web. This is an incredibly useful extension, and one that you will frequently use. If  your knowledge of HTTP is a bit rusty, now would be a good time to install Live HTTP Headers  and spend a bit of time watching traffi c fl owing.  Here is the traffi c generated when you view a simple test page.  For brevity, some lines have been  removed.

Notice that the wanted HTTP protocol version is also stated. The remaining lines of  the request include some additional information: the browser user agent; the Multipurpose Internet  Mail Extension  MIME  type, languages, and compression methods that the browser accepts; and  Keep Alive Connection options.  The server responds with HTTP 1.1 200 OK  indicating success  and returns test.html in the body  of the response.  Remember, this discussion is about headers here, not bodies.  The server response  indicates the MIME type of the resource returned  text HTML , the size, and the compression type   gzip here . The last modifi ed time is given, which will be important when you learn about caching.  After the browser has fetched test.html, it can parse the HTML and request any resources   contained in it. The test page contains two images, and the browser now requests these. The  responses are similar to the fi rst, but there are a few subtle differences: The Content-Type in the  response is now image gif, and no Content-Encoding header is set.  This web server isn’t confi g- ured to use  compression when delivering images.   A full discussion of HTTP could take up a whole book. Assuming you’re broadly happy with HTTP,  let’s continue the discussion by looking at the areas that relate to performance.  HTTP Versions  The history of the HTTP protocol can be traced back to the fi rst version, 0.9, defi ned in 1991. The  web was a different place then, and although this crude protocol served the job, it wasn’t long   c01.indd   8 c01.indd   8  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   Inside HTTP  ❘  9  before refi nements were made. These resulted in the creation of HTTP 1.0, defi ned in RFC  1945 in 1996.  Whereas HTTP 0.9 was limited to making simple GET requests with no additional headers,  version  1.0 added most of the features now associated with the protocol: authentication, support for  proxies  and caches, the POST and HEAD methods, and an array of headers. HTTP 0.9 is pretty much obsolete  now, but HTTP 1.0 is still occasionally seen in use and is still a usable protocol for  navigating the  modern web.  Although the move from HTTP 0.9 to 1.0 marked a major improvement to the protocol, the current  version — HTTP 1.1  laid out in RFC 2616 in 1999  — is essentially just a fi ne-tuning of HTTP  1.0, with particular improvements made to caching, reuse of connections, and support for virtual   hosting. Let’s look in more detail at the major improvements.  Support for Virtual Hosting  In the early days of the web, each domain had its own IP address, and there was never any need for  an HTTP request to specify from which domain it was requesting a resource. It simply connected to  the appropriate IP  obtained via DNS , and the web server knew which domain name this mapped  to. As the Internet boomed, and concerns grew about the limited IPv4 address space, web serv- ers began to support virtual hosting — a method to host multiple domain names on the same IP  address. One of the changes in HTTP 1.1 was the introduction of the Host header, which enabled  the client to specify for which domain it was requesting the resource.  A typical HTTP 1.0 request would have looked like this:          GET  index.html HTTP 1.0  In HTTP 1.1, this now appears as follows:      GET  index.html HTTP 1.1     Host: mydomain.com  Although this feature has little to do with performance, it had a big impact on the growth of the  web and is one of the most compelling reasons to use HTTP 1.1 over 1.0.  Caching  Caching is an important topic that will be discussed numerous times in this book. In general, it  consists of storing resources in a temporary location for faster retrieval in the future. In the case of  client-side caching, this temporary location is an area of the user’s hard disk, set aside by the web  browser. In many situations, the browser can retrieve previously requested resources directly from  the cache, without needing to query the web server.  Although the caching mechanisms of HTTP 1.0 provide fairly good caching support  albeit   somewhat vaguely defi ned , HTTP 1.1 extends these and adds a host of new options, including the  Cache-Control and Vary headers. These offer you much greater control over how browsers and  intermediate proxies can cache your content.  c01.indd   9 c01.indd   9  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   10  ❘  CHAPTER 1  A REFRESHER ON WEB BROWSERS  NOTE   You’ll learn more about intermediate caches and proxies in Chapter 2,  “Utilizing Client-Side Caching.”  HOW BROWSERS DOWNLOAD AND RENDER CONTENT  One of the most important building blocks for the budding web optimizer is an understanding of  how browsers render websites. They don’t always behave as you might expect, and there can be  subtle differences from browser to browser. Only when you fully understand these can you be in a  position to perform effective optimization.  “Waterfall” graphs are invaluable when trying to understand this. Let’s dive in with an example,  albeit for a fairly simple page — http:  kernel.org, the home of the Linux kernel — shown in  Figure 1-1.  FIGURE 1-1  The fi rst thing the browser does is resolve kernel.org to an IP address using DNS, as indicated  by the fi rst segment of the fi rst request line. It then attempts to open an HTTP connection to  kernel.org. The second segment shows the time taken to do this.  At the beginning of the third segment, the TCP connection has been created, and, at this point, the  browser issues its request. However, it isn’t until the start of the fourth segment that the web server  starts to send back content.  This can be attributed to latency on the web server.  Finally, some 847  milliseconds  ms  after the start, the HTML document has been fully retrieved.  Of course, most web pages don’t consist of simply an HTML document.  If they did, the lives of  web masters would be less complicated.  Invariably, there are also links to style sheets, images,  JavaScript, and so on, embedded in the page, which the browser must also retrieve.  c01.indd   10 c01.indd   10  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   How Browsers Download and Render Content  ❘  11  The browser doesn’t wait until it fi nishes retrieving the HTML document before it starts fetch- ing these additional resources. Naturally, it can’t start fetching them immediately, but as soon the  HTML document starts to arrive, the browser begins parsing it and looks for links. The fi rst of  these is the style sheet  kernel.css  contained near the top of the page in the head, and it duly  requests this. You now have two connections running in parallel — this is enormously faster than  the requests made in a linear fashion, one by one.  This time, you don’t have the delay of a DNS lookup  the response from the previous lookup has  been cached by the browser , but you once again have a delay while the browser initiates a TCP  connection to the server. The size of this particular CSS fi le is a mere 1.7 KB, and the download   segment of the request is hence barely visible.  Given what you now know about the browser parsing the document as it comes in, why is there  such a delay until us.png is requested? Perhaps this image isn’t referenced until approximately  three-quarters of the way through the document  because the download appears to begin approxi- mately three quarters of the way through downloading the HTML . Actually, this image is fi rst  referenced on line 35 of the document  which is more than 600 lines in total .  The reason for the delay is that, historically, most browsers only download two resources in parallel  from the same host. So, the request for us.png doesn’t begin until the request for kernel.css fi n- ishes. Look carefully at the rest of the waterfall to see that at no point are there ever more than two  requests running in parallel.  You’ll learn more about this shortly.   There’s something else different about us.png  and the resources that follow it  — there is no  TCP connection segment. The browser is reusing the existing TCP connection it has with the server,  cutting out the time required to set up a new connection. This is an example of the persistent con- nections mentioned earlier in this chapter. In this example, the saving is approximately 0.1 second  on each request — and more than 12 requests, which mounts up to sizeable savings.  It’s also worth noting that, in this example, the overhead involved in making the request makes up  a signifi cant proportion of the overall time. With the fi rst, fi fth, and twelfth resources, the actual  downloading of data accounts for approximately one-half the time needed to fetch the resource.  With the other resources, the download time is virtually insignifi cant, dwarfed by the latency of  issuing the request and waiting for a response from the server. Although this is only one example,  the pattern of many small resources is common and illustrates that performance is not all about  keeping the size of resources small.  Rendering  After the browser retrieves the HTML document, it can begin to parse the document and render  it on the screen. Referring to the waterfall view in Figure 1-1, the fi rst vertical line shows the point  at which the browser begins rendering, whereas the second vertical line shows the point at which   rendering is complete.  If the image dimensions are not known, the browser does not allocate any screen space to them   during the initial rendering. As a result, the page fl ow must be recalculated after they have been  downloaded, and the dimensions become known. This can lead to the rather ugly effect of text  jumping around the page as the page loads.  c01.indd   11 c01.indd   11  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   12  ❘  CHAPTER 1  A REFRESHER ON WEB BROWSERS  Although the kernel.org example implies that the page takes approximately 1 second to render,  this is a little misleading. Actually, the majority of the page renders in the blink of an eye. Then  you must wait for the images to download. If no images were involved  or they were already in the  browser’s cache , how long would it take the browser to simply parse and render the HTML docu- ment? This is an area discussed again in Chapter 6, “JavaScript, the Document Object Model, and  Ajax,” when you learn about ways to reduce rendering times.  Persistent Connections and Keep-Alive  In HTTP 1.0, the default behavior is to close the connection after a resource has been retrieved.  Thus, the following is the fl ow of events when the client needs to fetch multiple resources:    1.  The client opens a TCP connection to the server.   2.  The client requests the resource.   3.  The server responds and closes the connections.   4.  The client opens a new TCP connection.   5.  The client requests another resource.  This is a rather wasteful approach, and the process to build up and tea down the TCP connections  adds a signifi cant amount of latency to requests  not to mention extra CPU and RAM usage on both  client and server . This overhead is even more signifi cant when requesting many small resources,  which tends to be the nature of most websites.  Figure 1-2 shows this problem with a waterfall view showing a page containing 22 small images  loading in IE 7. The effect has been exaggerated a bit by conducting the test from a dial-up  connection to a web server located on the other side of the Atlantic.  So the latency is quite high.   The problem still exists for broadband users, just not to the same degree.   FIGURE 1-2  c01.indd   12 c01.indd   12  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   How Browsers Download and Render Content  ❘  13  Clearly, this is not an ideal situation, which is one of the reasons that  as you have seen  browsers  typically issue more requests in parallel when talking in HTTP 1.0.  Keep-Alive  This shortcoming was partially addressed by the introduction of Keep-Alive. Although it was never  an offi cial part of the HTTP 1.0 specifi cations, it is well supported by clients and servers.  With Keep-Alive enabled, a server will not automatically close the connection after sending a  resource but will instead keep the socket open, enabling the client to issue additional requests. This  greatly improves responsiveness and keeps network traffi c down.  A client indicates it wants to use Keep-Alive by including the header Connection: Keep-Alive  in its request. If the server supports Keep-Alive, it signals its acceptance by sending an identical  header back in the response. The connection now remains open until either party decides to close it.  Unfortunately, browsers can’t always be relied upon to behave themselves and close the  connection  when they fi nish issuing requests, a situation that could lead to server processes sitting idle and   consuming memory. For this reason, most web servers implement a Keep-Alive timeout — if the  client does not issue any further requests within this time period  usually approximately 5 to 10  seconds , the server closes the connection.  In addition, servers may also limit the number of resources that may be requested during the   connection. The server communicates both these settings with a Keep-Alive header like this:  Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100  However, Keep-Alive is not an offi cially recognized header name and may not be supported by all  clients.  Persistent Connections  HTTP 1.1 formalized the Keep-Alive extension and improved on it, the result being known as per- sistent. Persistent connections are the default in HTTP 1.1, so there’s no need for the client or server  to specifi cally request them. Rather, the client and server must advertise their unwillingness to use  them by sending a Connection: close header.  NOTE   Just to clarify, Keep-Alive is the name of the unoffi cial extension to  HTTP 1.0, and persistent connections are the name for the revised version  in HTTP 1.1. It’s not uncommon for these terms to be used interchangeably,  despite the  admittedly small  differences between them. For example, the  Apache KeepAlive directives  which you’ll learn about in Chapter 7, “Working  with Web Servers”  also relate to persistent connections.  Keep-Alive and Persistent Connections  Let’s revisit an earlier example, again conducted from a dial-up connection but this time to a server  that has Keep-Alive enabled. Figure 1-3 shows the waterfall view.  c01.indd   13 c01.indd   13  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   14  ❘  CHAPTER 1  A REFRESHER ON WEB BROWSERS  FIGURE 1-3  This time, the results are signifi cantly better, with the page loading in less than half the time. Although  the effect has been intentionally exaggerated, Keep-Alive is still a big asset in the majority of situations.  When Not to Use Keep-Alive  So, if Keep-Alive is only an asset in the majority of situations, under which circumstances might  Keep-Alive not be benefi cial?  Well, if your website mostly consists of HTML pages with no embedded resources  CSS, JavaScript,  images, and so on , clients will need to request only one resource when they load a page, so there  will be nothing to gain by enabling Keep-Alive. By turning it off, you allow the server to close the  connection immediately after sending the resource, freeing up memory and server processes. Such  pages are becoming rare, though, and even if you have some pages like that, it’s unlikely that every  page served up will be.  Parallel Downloading  Earlier in this chapter, you learned that most browsers fetch only a maximum of two resources in  parallel from the same hostname and saw a waterfall view of IE 7 loading http:  kernel.org to   illustrate this point. Given that parallel downloading is so benefi cial to performance, why stop at two?  The reason that browsers have  historically  set this limit probably stems from RFC 2616  which  details version 1.1 of HTTP; you can fi nd it at http:  www.ietf.org rfc rfc2616.txt .  According to that RFC, “Clients that use persistent connections should limit the number of simul- taneous  connections that they maintain to a given server. A single-user client should not maintain  more than 2 connections with any server or proxy…. These guidelines are intended to improve  HTTP response times and avoid congestion.”  However, the Internet has come a long way since 1999 when that RFC was written, and for some  time, web developers have been more than happy to use tricks to get around this limit. You’ll learn  about some of these shortly.  c01.indd   14 c01.indd   14  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   How Browsers Download and Render Content  ❘  15  More recently, browser vendors have started to fl out this guideline, too, usually justifying it by  pointing out that the RFC says “should not,” not “must not.” Of course, their main concern is with  providing a faster browsing experience to users  especially if other vendors have already increased  their maximum connections per domain  — any increase in network congestion or overloading of  the web server isn’t their problem.  The issue has caused fi erce debate, with apocalyptic predictions of web servers being brought to  their knees by this fl ood of parallel connections. This hasn’t happened yet, though, and for good  reason. While a browser making eight parallel requests rather than two can certainly increase server  load, it stands to reason that these eight connections will be open for a shorter period of time.  So, although it may cause a slight spike in load, it’s only short-lived. It would be hypocritical for  web developers to complain about this aspect of browser behavior because they often use tricks to  increase parallel downloading.  The fi rst major browser to break from this “rule” of two maximum connections per hostname was  Safari, starting with version 3 in 2007. Firefox 3 and Opera followed in 2008, and IE 8 in 2009.  Table 1-1 shows the current state of play.  TABLE 1-1  Maximum Parallel Connections Per Host  BROWSER  MAX PARALLEL CONNECTIONS PER HOST  IE 6 and 7  IE 8  IE 9  IE 10  Firefox 2  Firefox 3  Firefox 4 to 17  Opera 9.63  Opera 10  Opera 11 and 12  Chrome 1 and 2  Chrome 3  Chrome 4 to 23  Safari 3 and 4  2  6  6  8  2  6  6  4  8  6  6  4  6  4  It’s worth noting that IE 8 automatically reduces this fi gure to two for users on dial-up  connections  and enables web developers to detect the current value in JavaScript via window .maxConnectionsPerServer.  c01.indd   15 c01.indd   15  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   16  ❘  CHAPTER 1  A REFRESHER ON WEB BROWSERS  Increasing Parallel Downloads  Earlier, you learned that web developers have traditionally often used tricks to increase the amount  of parallelization. With the current generation of browsers all enabling more than two parallel con- nections, the need for this has greatly diminished. As of this writing, IE 7 still makes up a signifi cant  share of the market, though, so it’s still a topic worth discussing.  Eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that this discussion has been quite pedantic in saying that  browsers establish only x number of parallel connections per hostname. It’s not globally  there’s  another limit for that , per server, per IP address, or even per domain. You can easily exploit this by  forcing the browser to fetch more than two resources in parallel.  Consider the following HTML snippet:                                 Let’s look at how this loads in IE 7, a browser that sticks to the RFC guidelines, as shown in Figure 1-4.  FIGURE 1-4  c01.indd   16 c01.indd   16  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   How Browsers Download and Render Content  ❘  17  Increase the level of parallelization by splitting the images across two subdomains: static.linuxbox .co.uk and images.linuxbox.co.uk, as shown here:                                                                                              As shown in Figure 1-5, using this simple technique has cut approximately 0.6 seconds off the page  loading time.  Keep in mind that the nature of the Internet makes it diffi cult to exactly replicate the  conditions between runs. The second run may have found the network a little quieter, or the web  server less busy.   FIGURE 1-5  c01.indd   17 c01.indd   17  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   18  ❘  CHAPTER 1  A REFRESHER ON WEB BROWSERS  What if you take this to extremes and use enough hostnames to make all the images download in  parallel?                                                                                             Figure 1-6 shows the result. It’s not quite what you had hoped for — the page loading time has  just doubled! Although the additional DNS lookups required haven’t helped  but this could be   eliminated by using IP addresses rather than hostnames , the main problem seems to be the web  server  Apache, in this case , which was somewhat slow to answer the barrage of requests.  FIGURE 1-6  c01.indd   18 c01.indd   18  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   How Browsers Download and Render Content  ❘  19  After a little Apache tuning  you’ll learn exactly what was done in Chapter 7 , if you rerun the test,  the results are more promising, as shown in Figure 1-7.  FIGURE 1-7  This time, the load time was 1.15 seconds, an improvement on the test using two subdomains.  This illustrates that, unless the web server is geared toward such a fl ood of traffi c, too much  parallelization can dramatically reduce loading times.  So, where is the sweet spot? Research suggests that splitting content across two to four hostnames  offers the best performance. With anything more than four hostnames, you risk fl ooding the server  with requests, and  in the case of dial-up users  saturating the network connections.  It’s a mistake to think that parallelization can solve the problem of pages being too heavy, too. It’s  a great way to reduce the latency involved with issuing many requests for small resources  which is  how most sites are structured . However, if you have, for example, two large images, arranging for  them to download in parallel will simply result in each downloading more slowly. Bandwidth is a  fi nite resource.  Coping with Modern Browsers  Although splitting resources across hostnames used to be a great technique to reduce loading times,  its days are numbered because the most recent generation of browsers moves away from the RFC  guidelines. Catering for both older and newer browsers poses somewhat of a problem, though. It’s  quite easy to envision a scenario in which a site, carefully tuned to accommodate the two-connection  limit of IE 7, results in a surge of connections in IE 8, driving up CPU usage on both the client and  server, and killing performance.  c01.indd   19 c01.indd   19  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   20  ❘  CHAPTER 1  A REFRESHER ON WEB BROWSERS  One option is to compromise. Splitting resources across just two domains will still speed things up a  little for older browsers but will lessen the risk of the more recent browsers creating a packet storm.  Another solution would be to use server-side scripting to determine the browser type and ver- sion, and rewrite the HTML document accordingly. Thus, a Firefox 2 user may see resources split  across four domains, whereas a visitor on Safari would see them split across just two. Naturally,  this causes some additional CPU usage on the server, but it need not be too intense if the server  were simply returning different versions of a static document, rather than rewriting the page  on-the-fl y.  Coping with Proxies  This isn’t quite the full story, though. When multiple users behind a proxy visit a site  simultaneously, the web server sees a fl ood of connections all coming from the same IP address. With  older browsers, the two-connection limit helped to lessen this effect. With newer browsers issuing  perhaps four or six requests in parallel, the potential for a fl ood is much greater, and an Intrusion  Detection System  IDS  could easily mistake this for a SYN fl ood or other form of denial-of-service   DoS  attack  perhaps leading to the IP address being blocked . For this reason, most newer browsers  lower the number of parallel connections when the browser connects via a proxy, and, consequently,  their behavior is more like that of older browsers.  Incidentally, most proxies don’t support HTTP 1.1, so a client connecting through a proxy usually  must downgrade to HTTP 1.0, which leads neatly into the next subject.  Parallel Downloads in HTTP 1.0  Although persistent connections  also known as Keep-Alive  are supported in many HTTP 1.0  implementations, they are not an offi cial part of the specifi cation. As such, clients connecting via a  proxy — or to a server that does not support HTTP 1.1 — lose out on performance. Increasing the  number of parallel connections is a way to mitigate some of this performance loss. As a result, many  browsers use different levels of parallelization for HTTP 1.0 and 1.1. Thus, Table 1-1 can be refi ned  to show the data in Table 1-2.   TABLE 1-2:  Diff erent Levels of Parallelization for HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1  BROWSER  MAX PARALLEL CONNECTIONS  HTTP 1.1  HTTP 1.0  IE 6 and 7  IE 8  IE 9  IE 10  Firefox 2  2  6  6  8  2  4  6  6  8  c01.indd   20 c01.indd   20  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   Summary  ❘  21  Firefox 3  Firefox 4 - 17  Opera 9.63  Opera 10  Opera 11 and 12  Chrome 1 and 2  Chrome 3  Chrome 4 - 23  Safari 3 and 4  6  6  4  8  6  6  4  6  4  6  6  4  8  6  4  4  6  4  The effect is most noticeable in the older browsers, with newer browsers generally having   abandoned this strategy — perhaps because of the confl ict with the proxy connection limitations  previously discussed.  In the past, both aol.com and Wikipedia have intentionally downgraded to HTTP 1.0, presum- ably with the intention to speed up their loading times by tricking the browser into increasing   parallelization. This seems to be a somewhat muddled logic. If you must increase parallelization,  the techniques described in this chapter are a better path to follow.  SUMMARY  After a refresher on the history of the web, this chapter provided an inside look at the HTTP   protocol, and some of the key concepts for performance — persistent connections, parallel   downloading, and rendering. You also met caching, which is an essential part of any  website — both for speeding up loading times for the user, and for reducing load on the  server.   In Chapter 2, you’ll learn about the various types of caching, how they work, and how to  implement them to achieve blistering performance.  c01.indd   21 c01.indd   21  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   c01.indd   22 c01.indd   22  11 26 12   2:44 PM 11 26 12   2:44 PM   2  Utilizing Client-Side Caching  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Discovering the diff erent types of caches and proxies   ➤ Learning how to encourage browsers to cache your contents   ➤ Learning how browsers cache 301 redirects   ➤ Understanding DNS caching and prefetching in the major browsers  Caching is an important part of the modern Internet, but it is also an issue surrounded by a  lot of confusion and misunderstanding. The issue is so signifi cant that many web masters see  caching as their enemy and spend copious amounts of time trying to force content not to be  cached. As you shall see, though, caching is a signifi cant concept to ensure the smooth fl ow of  the web, and web masters would do well to embrace it.  UNDERSTANDING THE TYPES OF CACHING  Caching is a somewhat broad term, but generally refers to the storage of web resources  HTML  documents, images, and so on  in a temporary location to improve performance. Caches can be  implemented by most web browsers, perimeter  intermediate  web proxies, and at the gateways of  large internal networks. Transparent proxies  caches  are used by many Internet Service Providers   ISPs , reverse proxies sit in front of web servers, and the web server itself utilizes caching.   To understand caching, let’s take a closer look at each of these scenarios.  Caching by Browsers  Most web browsers implement a cache  an area of disk on which previously retrieved resources  can be temporarily stored  to hold recently and frequently accessed resources. This makes   c02.indd   23 c02.indd   23  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   24  ❘  CHAPTER 2  UTILIZING CLIENT-SIDE CACHING  perfect sense — it’s much faster to retrieve a resource from the cache than to request it again from  the web server. When deciding what to cache, browsers are usually quite well behaved and  respect the caching policy dictated by the server  which you learn more about in the “Controlling  Caching” section of this chapter .  There are several problems with browser caching. First of all, the size of the cache tends to be quite  small by default. Although the size of the average hard disk in a desktop PC has continued to grow  at quite a rate, increases in the default browser cache size have been more modest. Given that web  pages have become increasingly heavy, browsers would probably be more effective if they defaulted  to much larger caches.  Table 2-1 shows a breakdown of the maximum cache sizes for common browsers.  TABLE 2-1:  Maximum Cache Sizes for Common Browsers  BROWSER  MAXIMUM CACHE SIZE  Firefox 17  1024 MB  IE 6, 7, 8  1 32 of the drive space, capped at 50 MB  1 256 of the drive space, capped at 250 MB  IE 9  Safari  Unlimited  Opera 10+  400 MB  Chrome  300 MB  Also, when the cache becomes full, the algorithm to decide what to remove is crude. Commonly,  the Least Recently Used  LRU  algorithm is used to purge old items. This may seem fi ne at fi rst  glance, but it fails to take into account the relative “cost” to request different types of resources.  For example, the loading of JavaScript resources typically blocks loading of the rest of the page.   You will learn in Chapter 6, “JavaScript, the Document Object Model, and Ajax,” why this  doesn’t need to be the case.  It makes more sense for these to be given preference in the cache  over, say, images. Hopefully, this is something that future generations of browsers must take into  consideration.  Finally, there is the human element. Many browsers offer an easy way for the user to remove  temporary data  such as cached pages, sessions, and so on  for the sake of privacy. Users often feel  that cleaning the browser cache is an important step in somehow stopping their PCs from running  slowly.  Although, if you press them for the logic behind this, the most you’ll get is a vague answer  about giving things a spring cleaning.   So, although the browser cache is a huge benefi t, it’s not without its faults.  Intermediate Caches  The intermediate cache proxy  so called because so often it fulfi lls the purposes of both caching and  proxying  is commonly used by ISPs and larger organizations.  c02.indd   24 c02.indd   24  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   Controlling Caching  ❘  25  When used by ISPs, it typically takes the form of a transparent caching proxy that silently intercepts  HTTP traffi c. When the client makes a request, the proxy intercepts it and checks its local cache for  a copy of the resource. If none is found, it makes the request on the client’s behalf and then relays  this back to the client, caching a copy itself in the process. When another client on the same ISP  requests the same resource, a cached copy is then already at hand.  Although this type of proxy can offer signifi cant performance benefi ts  because the connection  between the client and the proxy is generally low latency and high bandwidth , the downside is that  there is some increased latency for resources that are not in the intermediate’s cache.  Closely related to this type of cache are the border-level caching proxies implemented by many large  organizations. Often, the primary reason for these is security  because they offer the capability to  fi lter content , and clients inside the local area network  LAN  must confi gure their browsers to   connect to the outside world via the proxy. However, they are often used for caching, too.  Reverse Proxies  Whereas browser caches and intermediate proxies are generally for the benefi t of the client, reverse  proxies are usually used for the benefi t of the web server. These proxies sit in front of the web server  and have two purposes  although sometimes they are used for just one of these reasons : caching and  load balancing. For caching, they can be used to lighten load on the back-end web server by serving  up cached versions of dynamically generated pages  thus cutting CPU usage . For load balancing,  they can be used for load-balancing multiple back-end web servers.  CONTROLLING CACHING  Now that you have a grasp of the main types of caches and proxies available, let’s look at methods  that attempt to control them.   NOTE   In most cases, all you can do is to suggest policies to caches and proxies,  but most of them will respect these suggestions.  Conditional GETs  Look again at the browser cache. How does it know if a local, cached copy of a resource is  still valid? The standard way is to send a conditional GET request. This takes the form of an  If-Modified-Since header in the request. If the server determines that the resource has been   modifi ed since the date given in this header  which will be set by the browser as the Last-Modified  time returned with the original response , the resource is returned as normal. Otherwise, a  304 Not Modified status is returned.  This can be neatly illustrated by requesting a resource in a browser, then re-requesting it a few   seconds later. Unless the web server is overriding this default caching behavior, you see a 200 OK  the fi rst time  assuming you don’t already have a copy in the cache  and then a 304 the second time.  Here’s what you see when you request http:  www.debian.org Pics debian.png:  c02.indd   25 c02.indd   25  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   26  ❘  CHAPTER 2  UTILIZING CLIENT-SIDE CACHING  http:  www.debian.org Pics debian.png  GET  Pics debian.png HTTP 1.1 Host: www.debian.org User-Agent: Mozilla 5.0  X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.8       Gecko 20100308 Iceweasel 3.5.8  like Firefox 3.5.8  GTB7.1 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http:  www.debian.org  Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache  HTTP 1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 01 Aug 2010 08:24:47 GMT Server: Apache 2.2.9  Debian  mod_perl 2.0.4 Perl v5.10.0 Last-Modified: Sat, 30 Jun 2007 13:26:17 GMT Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 3895 Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=99 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: image png ---------------------------------------------------------- http:  www.debian.org Pics debian.png  GET  Pics debian.png HTTP 1.1 Host: www.debian.org User-Agent: Mozilla 5.0  X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.8        Gecko 20100308 Iceweasel 3.5.8  like Firefox 3.5.8  GTB7.1 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http:  www.debian.org  If-Modified-Since: Sat, 30 Jun 2007 13:26:17 GMT Cache-Control: max-age=0  HTTP 1.1 304 Not Modified Date: Sun, 01 Aug 2010 08:24:50 GMT Server: Apache 2.2.9  Debian  mod_perl 2.0.4 Perl v5.10.0 Connection: Keep-Alive Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=98 ----------------------------------------------------------  On the fi rst request, a Last-Modified header of Sat, 30 Jun 2007 13:26:17 GMT is returned in  the response. The browser caches the image, along with this date.  When you issue the second request, the header If-Modified-Since: Sat, 30 Jun 2007  13:26:17 GMT is sent to the server, saying “send me  Pics debian.org if it has been modifi ed  since Sat, 30 Jun 2007 13:26:17 GMT.” In this example, this isn’t the case, and the server sends  back a 304 Not Modified status.  The benefi ts of this should be obvious. Rather than spending time downloading the resource again,  the browser can use its locally cached copy. However, there is also a signifi cant drawback: The  browser must still request the resource. In this example, in which the image was a mere 3.8 KB, the  time in setting up the connection and issuing the request is likely to far outweigh the actual time  that would be spent downloading the image.  c02.indd   26 c02.indd   26  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   Controlling Caching  ❘  27  Let’s try another test, this time using an HTML document containing four small images.  Figure 2-1 shows the waterfall view the fi rst time the page is requested.  With none of the resources having previously been requested, the cache is empty, and all resources  must be downloaded. When you repeat the test  as shown in Figure 2-2 , all fi ve resources are now  in the browser cache. The server sends back 304 Not Modified in response to the conditional GETs,  but this doesn’t help much because the time spent actually downloading the resource was so small.  In this test, the second run was slightly slower than the fi rst. This was a blip, perhaps because of  network conditions or changes in load on the server. Even so, the improvement in performance is  never going to be particularly big in this example.  That’s not to say this method of caching is useless, but merely that, in cases in which the download- ing of the resource forms only a small fraction of the request time, it doesn’t have much benefi t. Had  you used larger images, the difference would be noticeable.  Figure 2-3 shows another test page containing a 3.7 MB JPEG image:  FIGURE 2-1  FIGURE 2-2  FIGURE 2-3  c02.indd   27 c02.indd   27  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   28  ❘  CHAPTER 2  UTILIZING CLIENT-SIDE CACHING  On the fi rst run, the image takes a little more than 3 seconds to load, and the HTML page hasn’t  fi nished rendering until 6 seconds later.  On the second run  shown in Figure 2-4 , with the cache primed, the overhead to send the   conditional GET is almost insignifi cant to the size of the image, and the page loads in a mere  136 milliseconds  ms  — quite a saving.  FIGURE 2-4  Of course, these two examples are extremes of the spectrum. But, in practice, pages do tend to be  more like the fi rst example  with many small resources  than the latter.  It would be great if there were a way to tell the browser not to issue these conditional GETs if it  already had the resource in the cache. As it turns out, there is.  Utilizing Cache-Control and Expires Headers  In the previous examples, the server sent a Last-Modified header in responses, which contained the  date that the resource was last modifi ed. The client cached this date with the resource and used it to  send an If-Modified-Since header when requesting the same resource at a future date.  There are two more headers that can control caching: Expires and Cache-Control: max-age.  These headers effectively say to the client, “This resource expires on such-and-such a date. Until  then, you can just use your locally cached copy  if you have one .” The result is that the client  doesn’t need to issue a conditional GET.  But why are there two different headers for doing this? What are the differences, and which is the  best to use?   The main difference is that Expires was defi ned in HTTP 1.0, whereas the Cache-Control family  is new to HTTP 1.1. So, in theory, Expires is safer because you occasionally still encounter cli- ents that support only HTTP 1.0. Modern browsers understand both headers; although if both are   present, preference is given to Cache-Control: max-age.  mod_expires  In Apache, the mod_expires modules can be used to set both Expires and Cache-Control headers  at one time. The syntax is simple, but be sure that mod_expires is loaded fi rst:  ExpiresByType image gif "access plus 2 months"  c02.indd   28 c02.indd   28  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   Controlling Caching  ❘  29  This tells Apache to set Expires and Cache-Control: max-age headers with a date 2 months in  the future  that is, 2 months from the date at which the request is made  for fi les of the images  gif Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension  MIME  type. Alternatively, you can set the values to a  fi xed date.  Most examples on the web seem to use a date of Thu, 15 Apr 2010 20:00:00 GMT,  which suggests a lot of copy and pasting is going on.  However, this is recommended only for special   circumstances — it’s much better to use relative dates.  Let’s set up some expiration rules in an .htaccess, and then run the example again. Set GIF, PNG,  and JPEG fi les to expire in two months, as shown here:  ExpiresByType image gif "access plus 2 months" ExpiresByType image png "access plus 2 months" ExpiresByType image jpeg "access plus 2 months"  First, you do a hard refresh of the page to force all resources to download again, as shown in  Figure 2-5.  The header information has been expanded for the fi nal request response to show the  Cache-Control and Expires headers that have now been set.  When you re-request the page, the difference is spectacular, as shown in Figure 2-6.  FIGURE 2-5  FIGURE 2-6  c02.indd   29 c02.indd   29  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   30  ❘  CHAPTER 2  UTILIZING CLIENT-SIDE CACHING  This time, only the HTML page is requested. The four images contained in it are simply loaded  from the cache without bothering the server.  Choosing Expiration Policies  Armed with this powerful tool, you now must decide what to cache and for how long. Images are  prime candidates, along with cascading style sheet  CSS , JavaScript, HTML, Flash movies, and so  on. The only type of resources you don’t usually want to cache  or at least not for long periods of  time  is dynamically generated content created by server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Perl,  Ruby, and so on. Implementation is then just creating a ExpiresByType directive for each MIME  type. This can be done server-wide or on a per-directory basis, and, in the former case, you can  always override it for specifi c directories.  How long should you cache for? One or two months seems like a good fi gure, although there’s  nothing to stop you from setting longer times. Clients re-requesting resources once every couple of  months are unlikely to be a particular drain on the server, and for caching periods longer than this,  the benefi ts become less and less.  What about nonstatic resources that change on a semi-regular basis? Although it might be  tempting  to not cache these, even a caching time of a couple of hours can make a signifi cant difference in  performance.  Coping with Stale Content  Although far-future Expires Cache-control headers are great for performance, there will inevita- bly come a time when you need to roll out an updated version of your site’s logo, CSS, or JavaScript.  How do you deal with clients that already have these resources cached?  Fortunately, there are a few tricks you can use to make the client re-request the resource, all of  which revolve around changing the URL to trick the browser into thinking the resource is not  already cached. Following are some examples:   ➤ Use a version revision number or date in the fi lename  for example, sitecode-1.0.1.js .   ➤ Use a version revision number or date in the path  for example,  javascript 2011-03-26   sitecode.js .   ➤ Switch the resource to a Canonical Name  CNAME   for example, http:  rev101  .mysite.com javascript sitecode.js .   ➤ Append a dummy query string  for example, sitecode.js?v=1.0.1 .  The folks at bbc.co.uk go with the last method, as shown here:   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"    href="http:  static.bbc.co.uk homepage css bundles domestic main.css?553"    media="screen,print"  > <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="http:  static.bbc.co.uk       homepage css contentblock promo mediazone.css?553"    media="screen,print"  >  c02.indd   30 c02.indd   30  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   Dealing with Intermediate Caches  ❘  31  The folks at eBay.co.uk use a combination of the fi rst and second examples, as shown here:   link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="http:  include.ebaystatic.com       v4css en_GB e679i CCHP_HomepageV4_DLSR_e679i11667273_en_GB.css">  Few sites  if any  use the third method yet — probably because it involves additional work to set up  the domain name service  DNS  and has no particular benefi t over the other techniques.  It’s also worth noting that some intermediate proxy-caches may not cache resources that contain a  query string. So, the fi rst two options are the safest bet.  With a bit of planning, none of these URL tricks should be diffi cult to implement, and rolling out  new versions of resources should just entail changing global variables somewhere.  How Not to Cache  It’s common to see meta tags used in the HTML of pages to control caching. This is a poor man’s  cache control technique, which isn’t terribly effective. Although most browsers honor these meta  tags when caching locally, most intermediate proxies do not — because they tend to look at only the  headers of requests and not the body,. So, unless you’re in a hosting environment in which you don’t  have control over HTTP headers  in which case, moving the host would be a much better bet , such  meta tags should be avoided.  DEALING WITH INTERMEDIATE CACHES  Thus far, you have learned about controlling browser caching. What differences  if any  do you see  with intermediate caching devices?  Cache-Control Revisited  The Cache-Control response header supports a lot more options than just max-age, and some of  these options deal specifi cally with public caches. Following is a list of the most commonly seen  Cache-Control options:   ➤ Cache-Control:max-age=  — This is the maximum number of seconds for   which the resource should be cached.   ➤ Cache-Control:s-maxage=  — This is the maximum number of seconds for   which the resource should be cached on shared  for example, public  caches.   ➤ Cache-Control:public — This means that the response is cachable. This is used to  override situations in which the response would usually be noncachable  for example,  where HTTP authentication is used .   ➤ Cache-Control:private — This means that shared caches should not cache this resource.   Private caches  for example, those specifi c to a user, such as the browser cache  may cache  this resource.  c02.indd   31 c02.indd   31  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   32  ❘  CHAPTER 2  UTILIZING CLIENT-SIDE CACHING   ➤ Cache-Control:no-store — This means that the resource should not be cached in any   situation, whether on shared or private caches.   ➤ Cache-Control:must-revalidate — This requests that the cache must honor any   Expires Cache-Control: max-age headers set in the request. Without this, there are rare  situations in which the cache may serve a stale copy of the resource.   ➤ Cache-Control:proxy-revalidate — This is similar to must-revalidate but applies   only to caching proxies.   ➤ Cache-Control:no-cache — This means that the response must not be cached.  Recall from the earlier discussion about mod_expires that Cache-Control:max-age headers  can be set using the ExpiresByType directive  which also sets Expires headers . To set other  Cache-Control headers, you can use the Headers directive  part of mod_headers . Following is  an example:        Header set Cache-Control "private"    Don’t forget to ensure that mod_headers is loaded in your Apache confi guration fi le.  Cache-Control options may also be combined, as shown here:  Cache-Control: max-age=7200, must-revalidate Requests, not Orders  The guidance provided previously about Expires and Cache-Control:max-age should also apply to  public proxies and intermediate caches. Just remember that all caching-related headers are requests,  not orders. Although you can ask a cache to behave a certain way, you can’t force it. Although  browser caches are usually fairly well behaved, it’s not uncommon to fi nd intermediate caching  proxies that stubbornly insist on doing things their own way. In these situations, sadly, nothing  much can be done.  CACHING HTTP RESPONSES  Caching is usually associated with HTML documents and other resources, but there is also the  opportunity for browsers to cache certain HTTP response codes, potentially saving a round trip  to the web server. Unfortunately, this can cause problems for developers — especially if they are  unaware of this behavior.  The Shift in Browser Behavior  A regular source of head-scratching for many web developers has been caused by a subtle shift in the  way in which 3xx HTTP responses are cached by browsers.   Until a couple of years ago, none of the major browsers cached 301 redirect responses. So, if you set  up a 301 redirect from, say, http:  mysite.com a.html to http:  mysite.com b.html, when a   c02.indd   32 c02.indd   32  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   Caching HTTP Responses  ❘  33  user entered http:  mysite.com a.html into the browser’s address bar, the browser would  always issue a request for http:  mysite.com a.html — even if it had previously seen this  resource return a 301.  Given that a 301 status means “Moved Permanently,” it seems logical that browsers should  cache  or have the option of caching  such responses, and the HTTP 1.1 RFC  RFC 2616 at http:   www.w3.org Protocols rfc2616  says as much. According to that RFC, “This response is cache- able unless indicated otherwise.”  Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean that browsers should cache 301s, and for more than 10 years  the  RFC was published in 1999 , none of the major ones did. Thus, web developers became quite used  to the idea that 301 redirects could be modifi ed server-side without any browser caching problems. .  Things changed in 2009 when the new browsers, such as Google Chrome and Firefox  perhaps  driven by the increasing interest in performance , began caching 301 responses. The other major  browsers followed suit soon afterward.   Technically, this is probably the right thing to do, and the RFC appears to encourage it. But for a  generation of web developers used to the idea that 301s would not be cached, it has caused a lot of  controversy.  To compound the problem, many browser developers chose not to set a default expiration time on  these cache entries  Firefox is a prime example . So, after they are in the browser’s cache, they are in  there forever. Even using the browser’s option to empty the cache won’t remove them because they  are stored elsewhere. This creates no end to the problems if you have a 301 redirect in place and  want to change it. Even though a 301 says, Moved Permanently, this probably will not apply for all  eternity. In extreme situations, this caching can even result in infi nite redirects, with the browser  bouncing between two URLs that it believes redirect to each other.  It’s not all bad news. Although many of the latest browsers can cache 301s indefi nitely by default,  you can control this behavior  including disabling it  by setting an appropriate Cache-control or  Expires header  or, for safety, both . In the past, the main problem has simply been that web devel- opers did not realize they would need to do this.  On a more practical level, the issue arises of how to actually set Cache-control and Expires head- ers on a 301 redirect. In Apache, a standard Redirect doesn’t offer this option and, at fi rst glance,  neither does mod_rewrite. If you’ve worked with mod_rewrite before, though, you know how  powerful it can be. With a little bit of trickery, you can set additional headers on a 301.   You must fi rst abandon Redirect in favor of mod_rewrite, as shown here:   Redirect 301  a.html http:  mysite.com b.html RewriteRule ^ a.html$ http:  mysite.com b.html [R=301,L]  The magic comes in when you also set an environmental variable at this stage. You can then create  rules farther down that set headers if the env variable is set. The full code is as follows:  RewriteRule ^ a.html$ http:  mysite.com b.html [R=301,L,E=foo:1] Header always set Expires "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT" env=foo Header always set Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate" env=foo  c02.indd   33 c02.indd   33  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   34  ❘  CHAPTER 2  UTILIZING CLIENT-SIDE CACHING  In this example, the env variable is foo, and is given a value of 1 if the rewrite rule matches.  You then set two headers to request that the client does not cache the result. Of course, you could  just as easily set Expires headers in the near future to allow short-term caching of the redirect.  Using mod_rewrite will always be more expensive than a simple redirect, but it’s currently the only  solution to set caching times on 301s.  Using Alternative 3xx Codes  Given that a 301 means Moved Permanently, it’s worth rethinking the situations in which you use it.  Web developers too often use a 301 for any form of redirect, no matter how transient it may be.  302 Found  A 302 Found response is one option. It indicates that the resource is temporarily located at  another URL, and the RFC is quite clear that it should be cached only if appropriate Expires or  Cache-control headers have been set to permit it.  Incidentally, the HTML meta refresh tag  uses 302s.  This sounds promising but turns out to be something of a minefi eld for Search Engine  Optimization  SEO .   Because many web masters may not appreciate the difference between 301 and 302, Google actu- ally treats a 302 as a 301 if it decides the web master meant the latter. Bing and Yahoo don’t appear  to do this, but there is still concern over all three of the big search engines handling 302s in an  unwanted way. Because a 302 is generally taken to mean a temporary redirect, it doesn’t seem  appropriate to use it for long-term redirects.  303 See Other  For redirects that you do not want to cache, a 303 See Other is perhaps the most suitable option.  The RFC states that this response must not be cached, regardless of the presence or lack of caching- related headers. This makes it useful in situations in which you have limited control over headers or  are worried about badly behaved browsers caching 302s.   In most cases, though, you probably do want redirects to be permanent  or at least semi-permanent ,  and a 301 is the most appropriate response. You just need to be aware that browsers will take this  literally and set appropriate caching headers to prevent them from caching the 301s indefi nitely.  DNS CACHING AND PREFETCHING  DNS is a prime example of effective, well-thought-out caching. Without caching, the whole system  would fail under the load. DNS caching occurs at many levels, and although web developers or  system administrators don’t have a huge amount of control over how clients behave in this regard,  it is important enough that it should be examined. Later, you’ll learn about some specifi c measures  introduced in web browsers, but to start let’s review the DNS resolution process and the places in  which caching can occur.  c02.indd   34 c02.indd   34  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   DNS Caching and Prefetching  ❘  35  The DNS Resolution Process  When a user enters a URL into the browser’s address bar, the fi rst step is for the browser to resolve  the hostname to an IP address, a task that it delegates to the operating system. At this stage, the  operating system has a couple of choices. It can either resolve the address using a static hosts fi le   such as  etc hosts on Linux , or it can query a DNS resolver. Most commonly, the resolving  DNS server is hosted by the client’s ISP, but some home users also run a resolver locally to increase  performance. In larger corporate environments, it’s common for a resolving DNS server to run  inside the LAN.  If the queried resolver does not have the answer  to the DNS query , it attempts to establish which  name servers are authoritative for the hostname the client wants to resolve. It then queries one of  them and relays the answer back to the client that issued the request.  There’s quite a lot going on here, with a single DNS query potentially resulting in a string of queries  between multiple servers. Yet, despite this, DNS usually works effi ciently, with a typical query tak- ing less than 200 ms.  In practice, queries can be much faster than this because of the effects of caching. Whenever the  client issues a request to an ISP’s resolver, the resolver caches the response for a short period  the  Time-To-Live, or TTL, set by the authoritative name server , and subsequent queries for this host- name can be answered directly from the cache. Because the latency between the client and the ISP’s  resolving name servers is generally low, responses are typically under 50 ms.  However, remember  that wireless and dial-up connections have inherently higher latency.  Because this cache is shared  among all customers of the ISP, the cache may well be primed already as a result of look-ups by  other users.  The caching doesn’t stop there, though. Even if end users aren’t running their own caching  resolv- ing  name server, the operating system typically caches DNS answers. Because this doesn’t involve  any network traffi c, the latency is very low.  DNS Caching by the Browser  If that weren’t enough, the major browsers now also implement their own DNS cache, which, in  many cases, removes the need for the browser to ask the operating system to resolve. Because this  isn’t particularly faster than querying the operating system’s cache, the primary motivation here is  better control over what is cached and for how long.   For example, Opera caches DNS answers for 10 minutes, while Internet Explorer  IE  4 and  upward cache for 30 minutes. With Firefox 3.5 onward, the defaults are up to 400 cache entries  with a 3-minute life, but this is confi gurable via network.dnsCacheEntries and network .dnsCacheExpiration. None of the big browsers offer a way to specifi cally clear the  DNS cache; although using the option to clear general cached data will usually have the  same effect.  c02.indd   35 c02.indd   35  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   36  ❘  CHAPTER 2  UTILIZING CLIENT-SIDE CACHING  How DNS Lookups Aff ect Performance  The result of all this caching is that DNS look-up times can vary dramatically — anything from a  few milliseconds to perhaps one-half a second  longer look-ups aren’t uncommon for users on high- latency links  if a remote name server must be queried. This manifests itself mostly as a slight delay  when the user fi rst loads the site. On subsequent views, the DNS query is answered from a cache. If  you have a lot of resources spread across different hostnames  for example, to improve download  concurrency, although this usually isn’t necessary these days , these look-up times can mount up.  Using IP addresses rather than hostnames is one way to avoid the cost of the DNS look-up. But this  doesn’t tend to be practical given how extensively virtual hosting is used.  There’s no one-to-one  mapping between IP and hostname.  Instead, you should ensure that DNS queries on your domains  are resolved quickly and used with a high TTL to encourage longer caching. If necessary, use your  own name servers, where you have greater control over the TTL and network performance.  DNS Prefetching  Web browsers have another trick up their sleeves to help with DNS performance: DNS prefetching.  Introduced in Chrome in 2008, prefetching involves performing DNS lookups on URLs linked to in  the HTML document, in anticipation that the user may eventually click one of these links. All the  major browsers now support DNS prefetching; although the implementations differ slightly.  Prefetching is slightly reminiscent of those annoying browsers and plug-ins that were popular a  decade or so ago. They would prefetch all the links in an HTML document to improve responsive- ness. Web masters hated these browsers because they drove up bandwidth and server load, made  web stats meaningless, and end users often got a nasty shock if they were not on unmetered band- width. The difference with DNS prefetching is that the amount of data sent over the network is  much lower. Typically, a single User Datagram Protocol  UDP  packet can carry the question, and a  second UDP packet can carry the answer.  In Chrome, prefetching occurs in the background after the HTML document has been fetched — either while additional resources are retrieved, or the user is reading the page. Because a slow  look-up on one query would cause a delay in resolving the others, Chrome uses multiple threads   up to a maximum of eight  on operating systems that don’t support asynchronous DNS lookups   such as Windows . This ensures that a slow name server doesn’t hold up any other queries.   It’s interesting to note that when Chrome receives the responses to these DNS prefetch queries, it  simply discards them, rather than storing them in its DNS cache. Although this may seem odd, it  serves to prime the operating system’s DNS cache, which can return a response immediately should  the browser later request it.  Firefox 3.5 took Chrome’s prefetching implementation one step further. Whereas the original  Chrome implementation only prefetched hostnames used in anchor links, when Firefox downloads  an HTML document, it immediately begins resolving hostnames used in other resources  such as  images, CSS, and JavaScript . This is beyond the anticipatory prefetching used in other browsers and  is more of a case of streamlining parallel downloading.  c02.indd   36 c02.indd   36  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   Summary  ❘  37  Controlling Prefetching  One situation in which prefetching fails to be effective is with links that redirect straight to another  URL. A prime example would be the links in Google search results, which take the user to their  intended destination after fi rst passing through a tracking URL. Here, the tracking hostname would  be prefetched but not the ultimate destination domain. To accommodate this, most browsers now  support a   tag with the nonstandard rel="dns-prefetch" attribute. This causes the browser  to prefetch the given hostname and can be used to precache such redirect links. Following is an  example:     In addition, site owners can disable or enable prefetching through the use of a special HTTP header  like this:  X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off  Although introduced by Chrome, this header is recognized by all browsers that support prefetching.  SUMMARY  Caching is an essential part of website performance. Left to their own devices, browsers make a rea- sonable effort to cache through the use of conditional GETs. Although this cuts down on data trans- ferred from the server to the client, it does nothing to reduce the number of HTTP requests. Instead,  Expires or Cache-Control headers should be used because they are far more powerful and effective.  HTTP resources aren’t the only things to be cached by browsers, however. All the major browsers  perform some level of DNS caching, and within the last few years they have also begun to perform  DNS prefetching. Again, the details vary from browser to browser.  The fl ip side to aggressive caching is that sometimes the client has stale content, and trickery is  needed to force the browser to refresh. In recent years, this has become a particular problem with  301 redirects because of a shift in the way that browsers handle the caching of them.  Although you can set specifi c Cache-Control headers to discourage caching  for example, to stop  intermediate proxies from caching private data , resources on which you have previously set a  far-future expiration time are more problematic. The most common workaround is to use version  numbers in either the fi lename or the query string  for example, changing your HTML source to   reference myscript-v2.js rather than myscript-v1.js .  So far, you’ve seen only client-side aspects of caching. but in Chapter 7, “Working with Web  Servers,” you’ll see caching from the opposite end, and learn how web servers can save themselves a  lot of work by serving pre-generated content from a cache.  While caching is a very useful means of reducing loading times for repeated page views, it does   nothing to speed up the initial loading of a page  where the user’s cache is not primed . In Chapter 3,  you’ll see how compression can be used to reduce the amount of data that the client’s browser needs  to fetch.  c02.indd   37 c02.indd   37  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   c02.indd   38 c02.indd   38  05 11 12   4:33 PM 05 11 12   4:33 PM   3  Content Compression  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Understanding how HTTP compression works   ➤ Becoming familiar with browser quirks and how to handle clients   that don’t support compression   ➤ Exploring alternatives to gzip and deﬂ ate compression   ➤ Compressing directly in PHP  With bandwidth being a bottleneck for many users  and for dial-up users, easily the largest  bottleneck , it’s not surprising that web masters would want to compress their content. The  benefi ts are obvious — faster loading times for users and reduced data transfer bills for web  masters. This chapter examines the available methods of compression, which browsers  support them, and situations in which compression is not appropriate.

Of the top 1,000 sites, 227 did not support compres- sion, with only 1 in the top 20  live.com  and 10 in the top 100 not supporting it.  There’s also a fairly wide range in the amount of compression achieved in this Top 20 table, with the  size of the compressed contents being anything between 15 percent and 60 percent of the original.  In general, you should expect to see a compression ratio of approximately 1:3 or 1:4 for HTML,  but it is highly dependent on the nature of the text  in particular, repeating patterns . Later in this   chapter, you’ll learn more about ways to improve this.  c03.indd   40 c03.indd   40  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   Understanding How Compression Works  ❘  41  Although it’s diffi cult to produce accurate empirical data about download times  because there are  so many other factors , it would take a dial-up user approximately 14 seconds to retrieve the  youtube.com homepage without compression. With compression, this fi gure drops to 2 seconds.  For the painfully large sina.com.cn, without compression, dial-up users would need to wait more  than a minute for the homepage HTML document to download, a fi gure that drops to an almost  bearable 16 seconds with compression.  The picture isn’t quite so bleak for broadband users. Uncompressed, the homepage HTML   document of Sina.com.cn  which is, admittedly, unusually large  would take approximately 4   seconds to retrieve from a 1 megabit  mb  connection. Compressed, this fi gure drops to 1 second.  For more reasonably sized HTML documents  such as those on the homepages of Wikipedia or  Twitter , the benefi ts of compression for broadband users are fractions of a second. But this is  still a saving worth making. As connection speeds have increased, so, too, have expectations  of users.  UNDERSTANDING HOW COMPRESSION WORKS  Like many other features of HTTP  such as KeepAlive, as discussed in Chapter 1, “A Refresher on  Web Browsers” , content compression occurs only when a client advertises, wants to use it, and a  server indicates its willingness to enable it.  Clients indicate they want to use it by sending the Accept-Encoding header when making  requests. The value of this header is a comma-separated list of compression methods that the  client will accept. If the server supports content compression  or, more accurately, if it supports any  of the compression methods that the client has advertised , it may deliver a compressed version of  the resource. It indicates that the content has been compressed  and the compression method used   with the Content-Encoding header in the response, as shown here:  GET  1 icons.html HTTP 1.1 Host: linuxbox.co.uk User-Agent: Mozilla 5.0  X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.8        Gecko 20100308 Iceweasel 3.5.8  like Firefox 3.5.8  GTB7.1 Accept: text html,application xhtml+xml,application xml;q=0.9,* *;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache  HTTP 1.1 200 OK Server: Apache 2.2.9  Debian  PHP 5.2.6-1+lenny8 with Suhosin-Patch       mod_ssl 2.2.9 OpenSSL 0.9.8g mod_perl 2.0.4 Perl v5.10.0 Accept-Ranges: bytes Vary: Accept-Encoding Content-Encoding: gzip  c03.indd   41 c03.indd   41  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   42  ❘  CHAPTER 3  CONTENT COMPRESSION  Content-Length: 152 Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=98 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text html  The Content-Length header in the response indicates the size of the compressed content, not the  original, uncompressed contents.  If a client supports multiple compression methods, it may express a preference using so-called q-values.  In the following example, the client expresses a preference for deflate by specifying a q-value of 1.0  for defl ate and 0.5 for gzip.  Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=0.5, deflate; q=1.0  Compression Methods  The HTTP specifi cations defi ne four possible compression values:   ➤ identity — This indicates no compression. If a client advertises only this method in the   Accept-Encoding header, the server should not compress the response contents. This value  is used only in the Accept-Encoding header — a server sending uncompressed content  should not send a Content-Encoding: identity header.   ➤ compress — This method uses the UNIX compress method, which is based on the    Lempel-Ziv Welch  LZW  algorithm. Use of compress is deprecated in favor of the next  two methods.   ➤ gzip — For a long time, gzip was the most popular compression format. It’s based on   LZ77, which, in turn, is based on LZW. As the name implies, it is the same algorithm used  in the UNIX gzip tool.   ➤ deflate — Essentially, this is just gzip without the checksum header. deflate tends to be   a little faster but is also a little less effi cient.  NOTE   Rather than exploring the subtleties of these various compression   formats here, you should look at Appendix A, “TCP Performance,” which   discusses them in more depth.  Of these four methods  the fi rst of which isn’t actually a compression method , the latter two are the  most important and are well supported by today’s browsers. deflate is slightly superior, but any  compression is better than nothing. So, if you are in the situation of using only gzip, don’t worry  too much.  What to Compress  Potentially any resource can be served up compressed, but compression is usually just applied to  text-based content such as HTML, XML, CSS, and JavaScript. The reason is twofold:  c03.indd   42 c03.indd   42  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   Understanding How Compression Works  ❘  43   ➤ Text tends to compress much more than binary data.   ➤ Many of the binary formats in use on the web already use compression. GIF, PNG, and JPEG   are prime examples, and there is virtually nothing to be gained by applying content com- pression to these. That simply wastes CPU cycles and may even make the size slightly larger   because the compression method can add its own headers to the data .  In view of this latter point, there’s usually nothing to be gained by compressing text resources  smaller than a certain size either. The savings are minimal, and headers added by the compression  method may well result in the compressed resource being larger than the original. When you learn  about web servers in Chapter 7, “Working with Web Servers,” you’ll discover methods to compress  only certain content.  Browser Support  Sadly, browser support for content compression hasn’t always been great. Although the major  browsers started to introduce support for this feature in the late 1990s, one browser in particular   no prizes for guessing which  has, until recently, suffered regular small glitches in its implementa- tion. When a browser simply does not support content compression, that’s fi ne. But when a browser  claims to support compression, but does not do so correctly, this causes problems.   Table 3-2 summaries gzip and deflate support in the major browsers.  TABLE 3-2:  gzip and deﬂ ate Support in Major Browsers  BROWSER  GZIP DEFLATE SUPPORT?

A bug causes ﬁ rst 2,048 bytes of compressed  content to be lost in some situations.  A security update breaks gzip compression in  some situations.  These versions of IE implement deflate  incorrectly, which may cause problems.   There were numerous bugs in versions 4.06  through 4.08.  continues  c03.indd   43 c03.indd   43  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   44  ❘  CHAPTER 3  CONTENT COMPRESSION  TABLE 3-2   continued   GZIP DEFLATE SUPPORT?  NOTES  BROWSER  Opera 5+  Lynx 2.6+  Safari  Chrome  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Opera 6 appears to be the only major browser that  detects and automatically decodes compressed  content if the server has not sent  Content-Encoding: gzip  or deflate .  deflate support was added on version 2.8.6.  There have been problems in the past with  compression of non-HTML data  for example, CSS .  The problems with IE’s support for deflate stem from inconsistencies in the HTTP 1.1 RFC  2616 .  While the deflate compression algorithm is simply a stream of compressed data, RFC 2616 defi nes  the deflate content encoding method as a deflate stream inside zlib wrappers  the wrappers  provide error checking, among other things . Versions 6, 7, and 8 of IE expect to see just a deflate  stream, and choke on the zlib headers.   Because of the confusion, many browsers choose to support both the HTTP 1.1 defi nition of  deflate and the “raw” deflate stream. You can fi nd a more detailed comparison at  http:  www.vervestudios.co projects compression-tests results.  NOTE   You can learn more about zlib and deflate in Appendix C,  “Compression.”  In Chapter 7, when you learn about web servers, you can see how they can be confi gured not to  compress content for browsers with known buggy implementations.  Dealing with Clients That Don’t Support Compression  An analysis of log fi les shows that approximately 10 percent to 15 percent of clients don’t advertise  support for content compression  via the Accept-Encoding header . Can it actually be that 10 to 15  percent of the Internet still uses prehistoric browsers with no compression support?  It turns out that of this 10 to 15 percent, approximately one-half do actually support compression,  even though they don’t advertise it. The most common reasons for this discrepancy are intermediate  proxies and antivirus software stripping the Accept-Encoding header from the requests.  Why would they do this? Proxies and antivirus software are often used to fi lter content, and it’s  easier for them if the content is uncompressed. Despite the fact that it should be relatively trivial for  them to uncompress, they choose to penalize the client by stripping the Accept-Encoding header.  Usually, the end user isn’t aware that this is even happening. And, if you think this type of behav- ior would be restricted to uneducated two-bit software developers, think again. Big names such as  McAfee, ZoneAlarm, Norton, and Squid have all been guilty of this practice in the past.  c03.indd   44 c03.indd   44  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   Understanding How Compression Works  ❘  45  One strategy to deal with these problematic clients is to send some compressed content anyway to  see how the clients handle it. If the client parses it correctly, it should be safe to use compression  when delivering future content. The general logic of such checks would be as follows:   1.  When the client issues a request, check for the presence of a cookie.  Call it gzip_ok.  If the  cookie has a value of 1, you already know the client understands gzip compression and can  deliver compressed content to it.    2.     3.   If the cookie is unset and the client is claiming not to support gzip, check to see if it can han- dle gzipped content. You do this by including a link to an external JavaScript fi le  containing  some simple script to set the gzip_ok cookie to 1. You confi gure the web server to always  serve this script compressed. If the client can parse this JavaScript fi le, the gzip_ok will be set.  If the cookie has a value of zero, you know that you’ve already tested for gzip support, and  it hasn’t worked.    4.  The next time a resource is requested, you can use the presence of the gzip_ok cookie to   decide whether to serve compressed contents.  This seems like a somewhat long-winded technique and goes against the principals of keeping pages  lean, reducing the number of external resources, and so on. But don’t forget that this technique  would be applied only on clients that claim not to support gzip compression, and even then it would  be for only the fi rst request. The major drawback to this method isn’t its intricacy — it’s that it relies  on the client supporting JavaScript.  Another option is to compile a list of browsers that are known to support content compression, and  then serve compressed content to them no matter what the Accept-Encoding headers says. This  actually is not recommended, though. There may be legitimate reasons for the browser not advertis- ing support for compression  such as the user having disabled it , and sending compressed content to  a client that can’t decode it can render your site inaccessible. Better to risk longer page loading times  than no loading at all.   Even if you do concoct a mechanism such as one of these to deal with misbehaving clients, you’ll  still be left with perhaps 5 percent of clients that simply can’t handle compressed content. As such,  you should still strive to keep document sizes small.  Remember that a large document doesn’t just  mean larger download times; it also means larger parsing and rendering times.  Don’t fall into the  lazy trap to think that bloated HTML doesn’t matter because it will shrink after it’s compressed.  Disadvantages of Content Compression  Although content compression is almost always a good thing, there are a couple of small drawbacks.   First, there is additional CPU usage at both the server side and client side. The server must compress  the document, and the client must decompress it. As you’ll learn in Chapter 7, it’s often possible  for web servers to deliver precompressed versions of resources, rather than compressing resources   on-the-fl y each time a request is made.  Second, as already mentioned, there will always be a small percentage of clients that simply can’t  accept compressed content. Because of this, you can’t use compression to excuse bloated HTML. In  Chapter 4, “Keeping the Size Down with Minifi cation,”, you’ll learn about techniques to reduce or  improving compression ratios and minifying HTML.  c03.indd   45 c03.indd   45  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   46  ❘  CHAPTER 3  CONTENT COMPRESSION  gzip Performance  In Apache, mod_gzip and mod_deflate compress resources on-the-fl y when a compression-aware cli- ent requests them. Apart from being rather wasteful of CPU cycles, just how good is the compression?   As you’ll see in Chapter 7, with many web servers, you can compress the fi les and then have the  web server deliver these precompressed versions when talking to compression-enabled clients. This  allows you to break free from using the gzip deflate implementation in the web server. But is there  any real advantage in doing this?  Let’s now revisit the list of the top 20 websites  refer to Table 3-1  — only this time, without  the country-specifi c versions of Google and Yahoo, and Live.com  because it doesn’t support   compression . Can you improve on their compression ratios by using specialist compression tools?  7-Zip  http:  www.7-zip.org   has a reputation to pull out all the stops to deliver high levels of  compression, and it can write fi les in the gzip format.   Table 3-3 compares this to the GNU gzip tool  running at its highest compression level .

The results are made somewhat more confusing because you don’t know the compression tools  used by these sites. Some use the on-the-fl y gzip modules shipped with their web server; others  serve up pregenerated gzipped resources. However, the results do clearly show that many sites are  not  compressing as effi ciently as they should be — WordPress, eBay, MSN, and YouTube are prime  examples. As for Sina.com.cn, something is going seriously wrong.   NOTE   Interestingly, Amazon’s compression outperforms both gzip and 7-Zip,  suggesting it uses a tailored gzip compression implementation geared toward  higher levels of compression. Appendix C provides more information on the  scope for performance improvements in the underlying algorithm used by gzip.  In short, if you do need to compress on-the-fl y, you should look at how effi cient your compression  routine is — in some situations, you may be surprised. Try compressing your data with GNU gzip  and comparing the difference. If your setup allows you to serve pregenerated gzip data, you might  as well use 7-Zip, but there probably won’t be a huge difference over standard tools.  Other Compression Methods  Although gzip and deflate are widely used, a number of other compression methods are available.  None of these are part of the HTTP specifi cations, however, and support for them across browsers  is generally poor. Let’s take a quick look at them here, in anticipation of them perhaps becoming  more popular in the future.  bzip2  SDCH  UNIX users have long been familiar with the bzip2 format, which offers superior compression to  gzip  at the expense of somewhat higher CPU usage . With HTTP supporting compression and  gzip, it seems only natural that bzip2 should also be supported. Despite this, none of the major  browsers natively support bzip2.  Although some do by means of third-party extensions.   Apparently pronounced “sandwich,” Shared Dictionary Compression for HTTP  SDCH  is a com- pression method developed by Google. It enables a high level of cross-request redundancy through  the use of a domain-specifi c shared dictionary.  When a client fi rst requests a resource from a domain, a link to download the shared dictionary is  returned in the response header. This dictionary contains strings commonly used on the website.  Subsequent responses may then have their content encoded by replacing such strings with a reference  to their position in the dictionary.  This has the potential for huge savings. Elements common to many pages  such as the header,  footer, navigation menu, and so on  — whole blocks of markup — can potentially be replaced with   c03.indd   47 c03.indd   47  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   48  ❘  CHAPTER 3  CONTENT COMPRESSION  just a reference to the dictionary. Appendix C highlights the similarities with the dictionary-based   encoding of formats such as LWZ.  SDCH also introduces problems for fi ltering proxies and personal antivirus software because mali- cious code could potentially be split across multiple requests, making it diffi cult to detect. The view  among developers of such software already seems to be that it’s easier just to strip SDCH-related  headers from outgoing requests than to attempt to decode and parse SDCH-encoded content. After  reading the earlier section in this chapter, “Dealing with Clients That Don’t Support Compression,”  this attitude won’t surprise you, but it’s the end user who loses out.  At present, Chrome is the only browser that supports SDCH, and Google’s web servers are the only  servers that support it. Perhaps this will change in the future.  Intended for XML content, EXI encodes XML into a binary format, drastically reducing the fi le  size. Although none of the major browsers support EXI natively yet, the W3C is acting favorably  toward it, and it looks set to play an important part in the web in the future.  EXI  peerdist  Developed by Microsoft, peerdist applies the logic of peer-to-peer networks to the web by  enabling a client to retrieve content from its peers, as well as the originating web server. In theory,  this should enable faster retrieval and lighten the load on the originating server.  At the moment, support for peerdist is low, but with Microsoft being such a big player, it may  change this in the future.  Transfer Encoding  To conclude this section, let’s take a brief look at Transfer Encoding  TE , which is often confused  with Content Encoding. The two are similar. However, whereas Content Encoding is end-to-end,  TE is hop-to-hop. Any intermediate devices that encounter messages with TE headers can uncom- press the message and may not necessarily recompress before sending it on. As such, Content  Encoding is to be preferred.  Dynamically generated content poses a problem for servers, which are expected to send a  Content-Length header in responses. The server has the choice to either wait for the content to be  fully generated  so that it may calculate the size , or omit the Content-Length header.  The latter method was fi ne under HTTP 1.0 where Keep-Alive was not the default. The server  would simply close the connection after it had fi nished sending, and the client would infer that there  was no more content to come.  With persistent connections in HTTP 1.1  or Keep-Alive in HTTP 1.0 , the problem is trickier.  Because the connection will probably not be automatically closed, the client has no way to tell  when the server has fi nished delivering the response content. The server must send a  Content-Length header.  c03.indd   48 c03.indd   48  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   Compression in PHP  ❘  49  The disadvantage to this is that the server must wait until the back-end script has fi nished  running  before it can start sending the response. End users could easily be left twiddling their thumbs,   waiting for a heavyweight PHP script to fi nishing running before seeing any content.  The solution is Chunked Transfer Encoding  CTE , which enables an HTTP response  or, more  rarely, a request  to be split into multiple smaller packets. After the server generates the fi rst X  number of bytes, it can send them off  with the appropriate Content-Length and a  Transfer-Encoding: Chunked header , and the client knows that there is more to follow. The  server indicates that it has fi nished by sending a zero-sized chunk. Each chunk can have content  compression applied to it, too, which is the justifi cation to include this discussion in this chapter.  By default, CTE is considered to be enabled in both client and server in HTTP 1.1, so no addi- tional headers are needed to enable it, and there is no extra work for the web master or system  administrator.  If CTE seems like a perfect solution, there is the small matter of increased packet fl ow across the  network. Although the overall size of the response body stays the same, each chunk will have its  own set of headers, which will increase the overall amount of data sent down the wire. Unless the  client has severely restricted bandwidth or high latency, this shouldn’t be a cause for concern, and  the increase in speed perceived by the user will more than make up for it.  COMPRESSION IN PHP  A solution often used by web developers is to compress HTML output in a scripting language before  sending it to the browser. This has the advantage of not requiring any modifi cations to the web  server  for example, enabling or compiling in compression modules  and makes it well-suited for  code that will be distributed. As you will see, though, this approach is ultimately less powerful than  using the compression offered by many web servers.  Compressing PHP-Generated Pages  For compressing pages generated by PHP, there are a couple of options: output buffering and zlib.  The latter is the preferred solution these days, but the fi rst is still widely used, and you’ll see exam- ples of both here.  Using Output Buff ering  Let’s look at an example in PHP:  ob_start "ob_gzhandler" ; ?>  <?php           ...  c03.indd   49 c03.indd   49  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   50  ❘  CHAPTER 3  CONTENT COMPRESSION  Here, output buffering is used with the ob_gzhandler callback function to compress the buffered  output before sending it to the browser.  You can go one step further to create your own callback function to handle the compression.  Although this doesn’t mean you can use an alternative compression method such as bzip  you’re still  limited to what the client supports , it does provide the opportunity to deploy some minifi cation.  Consider the following:  <?php ob_start "myhandler" ;       function myhandler $buffer  {           $buffer = str_replace                       array  "\r", "  ", "\n", "\t" ,                     "" ;           return $buffer;      } ?>          ...  NOTE   Chapter 4 discusses minifi cation in more detail.  There are two main drawbacks to this method. The fi rst is that you must manually add the  output buffering line to the top of all scripts. This can be mitigated by placing the code in an  auto prepend fi le.  The second disadvantage is that, as a consequence of the buffering, no compression takes place  until the script fi nishes executing. At that point, the data in the buffer will be compressed, and  then drip-fed to the client. This contrasts with Apache’s mod_gzip, which can perform streaming  compression — as your code generates output and sends it to Apache, mod_gzip begins compress- ing it and sending it out to the client  which, in turn, can begin uncompressing the data immedi- ately . Tricks like these can help to reduce the latency of requests, particularly for dynamic pages  that take a long time to generate or are large.  Compressing with zlib  These days, the preferred method to compress with PHP is to enable the output_compression  option of the zlib extension.  Although this may seem to suggest otherwise, ob_gzhandler uses  the zlib extension, too.  This is a php ini option and can be set in either the code itself  via ini_ set   , a .htaccess fi le, or, as shown here, php.ini:  zlib.output_compression = 1  c03.indd   50 c03.indd   50  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   Summary  ❘  51  Optionally, you can also set the compression level, as shown here:   zlib.output_compression_level = 9  The default value is -1, which causes PHP to pick a level.  The only disadvantage here is that the setting is global, so, unlike ob_gzhandler, you can’t pick and  choose to which scripts it will be applied. This usually isn’t a problem, though, because you’ll gener- ally want to compress as much as possible.  Compressing Other Resources  What is a problem is that compression in PHP naturally applies only to the HTML document —  style sheets, JavaScript, and so on, are not affected. You could argue that the benefi ts to compress  these resources are lower because they are invariably being cached. But compression is generally a  no-brainer and is worth using even in marginal cases.   Some web developers get around this by using a simple PHP script to serve up CSS and JavaScript  like so:  <?php  ?>    header 'Content-type: text css' ;   ob_start "ob_gzhandler" ;   include 'style.css' ;  Then you link to it like so:      Evoking PHP to serve up static resources like this hurts performance, though, and actually isn’t nec- essary when better alternatives  such as mod_gzip  exist. Although compression in PHP is certainly  an option, it’s usually faster, cleaner, and more effi cient to use mod_gzip or similar.  SUMMARY  Compressing web content speeds up downloads and reduces your bandwidth bills. Although   compression causes a slight increase in CPU usage on both the client and server, the benefi ts far out- weigh this, and enabling compression is almost always the right thing to do. Any plain-text resource  is a candidate for compression: HTML documents, style sheets, JavaScript, XML, and so on. But  there is generally little to be gained from compressing binary resources.  Most images, for example,  are already highly compressed.   Browser support for compression has been buggy in the past, with some browsers incorrectly   handling compressed CSS or JavaScript. Fortunately, those days have passed, and today you should  generally compress as much as possible.  c03.indd   51 c03.indd   51  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   52  ❘  CHAPTER 3  CONTENT COMPRESSION  The standard compression methods are gzip or deflate — they are essentially the same  thing — and, although other methods  offering better compression  have been proposed, none are  yet widely supported.  The standard way to compress content is via a web server module such as mod_gzip  a topic that  will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 , but you can also generate compressed content directly  via a scripting language. The examples provided in this chapter used PHP, but you can implement  the same principals in ASP, Python, Ruby, Perl, and so on. Nevertheless, compression this way isn’t  as effi cient, nor is it the preferred route.  While compression is an excellent way of improving page loading times, it is not being used to its  full potential if the text being compressed is bloated. Minifi cation refers to the process of stripping  down the plain text  often prior to compression , and is the subject of Chapter 4.  c03.indd   52 c03.indd   52  05 11 12   4:38 PM 05 11 12   4:38 PM   4  Keeping the Size Down with  Miniﬁ cation  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Shrinking your CSS, JavaScript, and HTML   ➤ Learning the tricks used by Google’s Closure Compiler and Yahoo’s   YUI Compressor   ➤ Comparing automatic miniﬁ ers  Minifi cation is the act to strip out unnecessary characters from code to reduce the size, and a  minifi er is the tool that does it. Most often, the term is applied to JavaScript, but as you shall  see, the technique can also be used on CSS and  to some extent  HTML.  For the web master, the aim of minifi cation is, of course, to reduce fi le size and thus speed  up transfer times for clients. Using gzip compression offers bigger reductions in fi le size,  and it’s often claimed that this makes minifi cation redundant — a minifi ed, gzipped page  isn’t much smaller than an unminifi ed, gzipped page. Although there is some truth in this  argument, minifi cation is still a useful technique. And with approximately 10 percent of  web traffi c passing through browsers that don’t support gzip compression  see http:   developer.yahoo.com performance rules.html , there is a sizable minority of users  for whom minifi cation can help a lot.  The downside with minifi cation is that code becomes diffi cult to read and modify. One   solution is to store your code unminifi ed and then minify it on-the-fl y, as clients request it.  This is a terribly ineffi cient way to handle what are usually fairly static resources, though, and   defi nitely not something recommended. Instead, you should keep an unminifi ed copy of the  code in a separate directory and pass it through the minifi er when you are ready for it to go  live,  possibly as part of your build process  c04.indd   53 c04.indd   53  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   54  ❘  CHAPTER 4  KEEPING THE SIZE DOWN WITH MINIFICATION  NOTE   For all but the most basic websites, it is common to automate the process  of deploying a new version of the site via a basic shell script or batch fi le. This  might consist of copying the code over from a development staging area, setting  the correct fi le permissions, pre-compressing resources, and so on. This is an  ideal place in which to perform minifi cation.  What are “unnecessary characters”? In the languages discussed here, whitespace and comments are  the main candidates for removal, and many simplistic minifi ers remove only these. This is often just  scraping the surface of what is possible though — especially with JavaScript, which is where the  discussion in this chapter starts.  NOTE   Be aware that minifi cation shouldn’t be used as an excuse to write sloppy  code. Don’t fall into the trap to think that it’s okay to write bloated, badly   structure code because a minifi er will clean it up for you. Your fi rst step should  always be to manually clean up your code as much as possible; only then  should you pass it through the minifi er.  JAVASCRIPT MINIFICATION  Of the three languages examined here  JavaScript, CSS, and HTML , JavaScript offers the most  potential for minifi cation. Aside from removing whitespaces and comments, Windows-style line  breaks  CRLF  can be converted to UNIX-style breaks  LF , and variable names can be shortened.  Let’s look at the typical minifi cation process for a small block of code. In this case, the code handles  a function to toggle the “visibility”  more accurately the display  of an element:  function toggle elementID  {                  if   document.getElementById elementID .style.display != 'none'   {                document.getElementById elementID .style.display  = 'none';         }         else {                 document.getElementById elementID .style.display = '';         } }  As it stands, this function weighs in at 297 bytes.  Before you run it through a minifi er, you should attempt some manual optimization. Using a   variable holding a reference to the element’s display would be a good start, as shown here:  function toggle elementID  {         var el = document.getElementById elementID ;         if   el.style.display != 'none'   {  c04.indd   54 c04.indd   54  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   JavaScript Miniﬁ cation  ❘  55                  el.style.display = 'none';         }         else {                 el.style.display = '';         } }  This takes the weight down to 246 bytes.  You can simplify things a bit more by getting rid of the if else block and using the ternary  operator:  function toggle elementID  {         var el = document.getElementById elementID ;           el.style.display != 'none'   ? el.style.display = 'none' :               el.style.display = '';   }  This takes it down to 193 bytes. So far, you have preserved whitespaces, and the code is still readable.  Now that you’ve seen how to clean up this code, you can pass it through a minifi er.  YUI Compressor  One of the most popular minifi ers is Yahoo’s YUI Compressor. It’s a command-line minifi er, written in  Java, that can process both JavaScript and CSS. You can download it from http:  developer.yahoo .com yui compressor .  Of course, you must have Java installed.  Running it is simple, as shown here:  $ java -jar  usr local bin  yuicompressor-2.3.5 build yuicompressor-2.3.5.jar       input.js > output.js  Now try it on the sample function introduced earlier:  $ java -jar  usr local bin yuicompressor-2.3.5 build yuicompressor-2.3.5.jar       function.js > function_minified.js $ cat function_minified.js function toggle a {var b=document.getElementById a ;if b.style.display!="none"       {b.style.display="none"}else{b.style.display=""}};  A few things have happened here. Unnecessary whitespaces have been removed, and the two vari- ables have had their names shortened: elementID to A, and el to B. Because these variables exist  only inside the function, it’s safe to rename them without worrying about it impacting other code.  This takes the function’s size down to 93 bytes — a signifi cant improvement from the original 342.  Just to stress the importance of manually optimizing your code fi rst, look at how the YUI  Compressor copes with the original function before you made any changes to it:  function toggle A {var B=document.getElementById A ;      if document.getElementById A .style.display!="none"       {document.getElementById A .style.display="none"}      else{document.getElementById A .style.display=""}};  c04.indd   55 c04.indd   55  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   56  ❘  CHAPTER 4  KEEPING THE SIZE DOWN WITH MINIFICATION  It has still renamed the local variables and removed whitespaces, but the long-winded if else  block with references to the element’s display are still there, and the size is down to only 204 bytes.  The YUI Compressor may be clever, but it’s not a mind reader.  You may have wondered why, in the manual optimization examples, var el = document .getElementById elementID ; was not simply written to el = document .getElementById elementID ; to save a few more bytes.  Although it may seem that declaring a variable with var is unnecessary, there is a subtle impact  on the variable’s scope. Variables defi ned inside a function with var are local — that is, they exist  only inside the function. Initializing a variable without var causes it to have a global scope, and it is  available to code outside the function.  Aside from it making good programming sense to use local variables  because that lessens the  potential for variable names to clash , the choice of a local versus global variable also has an  impact on minifi cation. For example, say that you run the following through the YUI  Compressor:  function toggle elementID  {     el = document.getElementById elementID ;      el.style.display != 'none'   ? el.style.display = 'none' : el.style.display = ";  Following is the output this time:  function toggle A {el=document.getElementById A .style.display;       el!="none" ?el="none":el=""};  The YUI Compressor realizes that el is a global variable and shies away touching it in case it breaks  another part of your code. In general, it’s best to defi ne your variables with var.  Google Closure  The YUI Compressor is not the only JavaScript minifi er out there. The new kid on the block at the  moment is Google’s Closure Compiler  http:  code.google.com closure compiler  , which is  set to become the leader of the pack. Crude benchmarking suggests its standard mode offers levels  of minifi cation similar to the YUI Compressor, whereas the advanced  and less foolproof  option has  the capability to make more savings.  Two of the most exciting features of this advanced mode are function inlining and the removal of  unused code..   Inline expansion  or inlining  will be familiar to anyone who has studied C compilers. It’s the act to  insert the contents of a function into the place where the function would have been called. This can  improve the execution speed  by cutting out the overhead involved in calling the function , and — in  the case of small functions that are rarely called — reduce the overall fi le size.   c04.indd   56 c04.indd   56  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   JavaScript Miniﬁ cation  ❘  57  Let’s look at an example.    function showalert message  {          el = document.getElementById 'alertbox' ;         el.innerHTML = message;         el.style.visibility = 'visible';  x = document.getElementById 'formfield' ;  if  x.value == "no"  {         showalert "Did you really mean no?" ; }  NOTE   innerHTML is nonstandard but is well supported and a little faster than  the alternatives.  This is not a useful piece of code, but it serves nicely as an example. Look at the value of a domain  object model  DOM  element named formfield. If the value is "no", you call a function to display  an alert message.  Let’s see what happens when you run this through Closure. For the sake of readability, let’s use the  PRETTY_PRINT formatting option to preserve whitespaces.  java -jar compiler.jar --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS  --js       example.js --formatting PRETTY_PRINT  x = document.getElementById "formfield" ; if x.value == "no"  {   el = document.getElementById "alertbox" ;   el.innerHTML = "Did you really mean no?";   el.style.visibility = "visible" } ;  As you can see, the showalert function has been removed. Its content has been placed inline where  the showalert   call previously was.  That’s fi ne in this simplistic example, where the function is called only once. But what happens if  your code makes multiple calls to the function, as shown here?  function showalert message  {          el = document.getElementById 'alertbox' ;         el.innerHTML = message;         el.style.visibility = 'visible';  x = document.getElementById 'formfield' ;  }  }  c04.indd   57 c04.indd   57  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   58  ❘  CHAPTER 4  KEEPING THE SIZE DOWN WITH MINIFICATION  if  x.value == "no"  {         showalert "Did you really mean no?" ; }  y = document.getElementById 'formfield1' ; if  y.value == "no"  {         showalert "Did you really mean no?" ; }  z = document.getElementById 'formfield2' ; if  z.value == "no"  {         showalert "Did you really mean no?" ; }    The result is as follows:  java -jar compiler.jar --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS        --js example.js --formatting PRETTY_PRINT  function a b  {   el = document.getElementById "alertbox" ;   el.innerHTML = b;   el.style.visibility = "visible" } x = document.getElementById "formfield" ; x.value == "no" && a "Did you really mean no?" ; y = document.getElementById "formfield1" ; y.value == "no" && a "Did you really mean no?" ; z = document.getElementById "formfield2" ; z.value == "no" && a "Did you really mean no?" ;  This time, Closure had the sense not to inline the function.  The second cool feature of the advanced mode — removal of unused functions — is straightforward.  If Closure deems that a function will never be called, it removes it.  The danger emerges when the function is called from elsewhere  for example, if you have a bunch  of JavaScript fi les and are passing them through Closure one by one  or is called by means of an  eval   statement. eval statements are a common stumbling block for minifi ers, are slow to run,  and are a potential security problem. So, whenever possible, you should avoid using them anyway.   Google also recommends compiling all the code used on a page in one go  by passing multiple fi le- names to Closure at the command line  to lessen the problem of functions being removed.  Comparison of JavaScript Miniﬁ ers  So far, you’ve learned about the two big players, the YUI Compressor and Google Closure. But there  are plenty of other JavaScript minifi ers out there.  The examples presented in this chapter thus far have been small, hence the savings have been small,  too. To illustrate how useful minifi cation can be, a bigger example is needed.  c04.indd   58 c04.indd   58  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   CSS Miniﬁ cation  ❘  59  Prototype  http:  www.prototypejs.org   is a popular JavaScript framework for AJAX   developers. Version 1.6.0 consists of a single JavaScript fi le, weighing in at 122 KB.  Table 4-1 shows the results of passing prototype.js through fi ve of the most popular JavaScript  minifi ers.  TABLE 4-1:  JavaScript Miniﬁ er Comparison  UNCOMPRESSED  KB   GZIPPED  KB   MINIFIER  None  YUI Compressor  JSMin  Closure  simple   Closure  advanced   Packer  Perl port   122  71  91  70  55  90  28  21  23  21  18  23  As you can see, the YUI Compressor and Closure are easily the leaders, and — in the case of the  Closure’s simple mode — offer similar levels of compression. If you’re feeling brave, and are willing  to debug any errors, Closure’s advanced mode offers an even greater boost.  These results also address the criticism of minifi cation given at the beginning of this chapter —  that minifi cation is largely redundant because of gzip compression. The difference in size between  the gzipped unminifi ed code and the gzipped YUI Compressor output is 7 KB, a reduction of  25 percent. With Closure’s advanced mode, the decrease in size is more than 30 percent. Coupled  with the fact that minifi ed code tends to execute slightly faster, minifi cation of JavaScript certainly  should not be ignored.  CSS MINIFICATION  Many of the minifi cation techniques outlined for JavaScript minifi cation are also applicable to CSS —  the removal of extra whitespaces, removal of comments, and conversion of CRLF to LF. And, as with  JavaScript, this is where many simplistic minifi ers end. At fi rst glance, it may seem as if there isn’t  much more you can do to shrink the size of CSS, but as you shall see, this is certainly not the case.  Use Shorthand  Many properties have shorthand variations. Consider the following example:  .myclass {         margin-left: 10px;         margin-right: 10px;         margin-bottom: 20px;         margin-top: 20px; }  c04.indd   59 c04.indd   59  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   60  ❘  CHAPTER 4  KEEPING THE SIZE DOWN WITH MINIFICATION  You can write this simply as follows:  .myclass { margin: 20px 10px 20px 10px;}  Or, because in this case the top and bottom margins are equal to each other and so are the left and  right, you could write this just as simply as follows:  .myclass { margin: 20px 10px;}  This shrinks the code to one-quarter of its original size  from 122 bytes to 31 bytes .  Similarly, consider the following:  p {     font-size:12pt;     font-family: verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;     font-weigth:bold;     font-variant: italic; }  This can be more cleanly expressed as follows:  p { font: italic bold 12pt verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;}  Hex triple color codes may be written in shorthand, providing both characters of the triplet are the  same. For example, FFEEDD can be abbreviated as simply FED, and 88DD22 as 8D2; conversely,  ABCDEF cannot be shortened.  Grouping Selectors  In some situations, selectors can be grouped together. Consider the following:  h1 { background-color:red;} h2 { background-color:red;} h3 { background-color:red;}  This can be shortened to the following:  h1, h2, h3 { background-color:red;}  CSS Miniﬁ ers  Earlier in this chapter, you learned about JavaScript minifi cation, and that, although many  minifi ers could optimize certain aspects of the code  for example, shortening variable names,  inlining functions, and so on , it still pays to do some manual optimization fi rst. How true is  this for CSS?  The following code has plenty of scope for optimization. Can you spot them all?  c04.indd   60 c04.indd   60  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   CSS Miniﬁ cation  ❘  61  .myclass1 {         margin-left: 10px;         margin-right: 0px;         margin-bottom: 20px;         margin-top: 20px;         background: AABBCC;         color:white; }  .myclass2 {         margin-left:10px;         margin-right:0px;         margin-bottom:20px;         margin-top:20px;         background:AABBCC;         color:white; }  Aside from stripping whitespaces, you can group the two selectors together, shorten AABBCC to  ABC, change 'white' to FFF, and group the margin attributes together, ending with the  following  with whitespace preserved for readability :  .myclass1, .myclass2 {      margin:20px 0 20px 10px;       background:ABC;       color:FFF }  Let’s see how the YUI Compressor handles it:  java -jar  usr local bin yuicompressor-2.3.5 build yuicompressor-2.3.5.jar        tmp test.css .myclass1{margin-left:10x;margin-right:0;margin-bottom:20px;      margin-top:20px;background:ABC;color:white;}.myclass2      {margin-left:10x;margin-right:0;margin-bottom:20px;      margin-top:20px;background:ABC;color:white;}  Although this has taken the size down from 334 bytes to 212, it’s mostly because of whitespace  being stripped out. The only other change has been to convert 0px to just 0. This is somewhat  disappointing, considering how much else could be done.  Luckily, there are plenty of alternatives, and a personal favorite is CSSTidy  http:  csstidy .sourceforge.net  , available for Windows, UNIX, and Linux. By default, CSSTidy preserves  whitespace, but you can easily override this at the command line. Let’s see how it copes with the  sample style sheet.  $ wine csstidy.exe  tmp test.css --template=highest output.css  Selectors: 2  Properties: 12 Input size: 0.327KiB  Output size: 0.07KiB  Compression ratio: 78.51% -----------------------------------  3: Optimised number: Changed "0px" to "0"  c04.indd   61 c04.indd   61  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   62  ❘  CHAPTER 4  KEEPING THE SIZE DOWN WITH MINIFICATION  6: Optimised color: Changed "AABBCC" to "ABC" 7: Optimised color: Changed "white" to "FFF" 12: Optimised number: Changed "0px" to "0" 15: Optimised color: Changed "AABBCC" to "ABC" 16: Optimised color: Changed "white" to "FFF"  ----------------------------------- CSSTidy 1.3 by Florian Schmitz 2005, 2006 $ cat output.css .myclass1,.myclass2{background:ABC;color:FFF;margin:20px 0 20px 10px;}  That’s quite impressive, and the resulting fi le size is down to a respectable 73 bytes.  Is there anything more you can do? CSSTidy has an array of command-line options that control indi- vidual optimization tricks, but most are enabled by default. The option to remove the trailing semico- lon from the end of the selector properties is not, however. Turning this on results in the following:  .myclass1,.myclass2{background:ABC;color:FFF;margin:20px 0 20px 10px}  There is a mere saving of 1 byte in this example, but you may as well still use it.  Improving Compression  Because you’ll generally want to serve up CSS compressed  for example, using mod_deflate in  Apache , anything that a minifi er can do to improve the compression ratio is also welcome. As you  will learn in Appendix C, “Compression,” LWZ  the basis for gzip and deflate  compression  likes repeating strings, so your aim should be to increase the frequency of these. Being consistent in  your use of case and spacing helps to improve compression, as does listing properties in a consistent  order. Consider the following:  .myClass {     color:FFF;     background-color: fff;     border: solid 1px black; }  .myOtherClass{    border: solid black 2px;    background-color:white;    color:fff; }  .myOtherClass {     color:FFF;     background-color:FFF;     border: solid 2px black; }  This compresses poorly. The second rule uses lowercase for the hex color code and a color name for  the background, lists the border attributes in a different order, is missing a space before the opening  curly bracket, and lists the attributes in a different order than the fi rst class rule. Now, rewrite the  rules like so:  c04.indd   62 c04.indd   62  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   HTML Miniﬁ cation  ❘  63  Here, the opportunity for greater compression is increased. Remember that LWZ uses a  history window and searches only so far back when looking for repeating strings  how far  depends on the implementation . So, although nearby rules may give matches, rules at the other  end of the style sheet probably won’t. As a result, you must think about the order in which rules   not just attributes  are defi ned, and you may fi nd it benefi cial to group together rules with  similar attributes.  This is an aspect of minifi cation that most minifi ers ignore. But CSSMin  https:  github.com  barryvan CSSMin   is different. Written in Java, CSSMin performs the ordering of properties,   conversion to lowercase, and replacement of simple names with their hex or numeric equivalents.   For example, font-weight:bold is converted to font-weight:600, color:black to color:000.   You get all this, plus the usual minifi cation techniques.   NOTE   Be aware, however, that re-ordering properties can cause problems.  Occasionally, it is necessary to list properties in a specifi c order because of  browser quirks.  HTML MINIFICATION  Whereas minifi cation of CSS and JavaScript are both popular techniques  as evidenced by the  number of minifi ers and blog posts on the subject , minifi cation of HTML has so far failed to  catch on.  Part of the reason for this is that it requires more thought to implement. Whereas CSS and  JavaScript are usually static fi les, HTML is often generated on-the-fl y by assembling fragments of  markup using a back-end scripting language. Web masters are then faced with the choice to either  minify each of these fragments, or perform the minifi cation on-the-fl y, prior to the HTML being  sent to the client. In the latter case, the performance overheads may well outweigh the benefi ts   which can admittedly be quite low .  That said, minifi cation of HTML is still a worthwhile endeavor. Although the benefi ts of CSS and  JavaScript minifi cation are often seen only once for the client  because these resources are generally  cached by the browser, at least for the length of the session , the benefi ts of HTML minifi cation are  seen on each page load. So, although the percentage decrease in size may be lower for HTML  documents, the cumulative effect over the length of the user’s session is often greater than that for  CSS and JavaScript.  HTML minifi cation is also quite a controversial subject, partly because many of the minifi cation  techniques result in markup that is not valid XHTML. The whole HTML versus XHTML argu- ment has been raging for years and isn’t something to be examined here, except to say that using  XHTML for your documents may not be as important as you think.  Most web servers still serve  pages using the text html content type, so, even if you use XHTML in your doctype, the browser  still renders it as HTML. Part of the reason for the lack of uptake of XHTML — which would be  served as application XHTML+XML — is that Internet Explorer does not support it.   c04.indd   63 c04.indd   63  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   64  ❘  CHAPTER 4  KEEPING THE SIZE DOWN WITH MINIFICATION  HTML Miniﬁ cation Techniques  Let’s look at some of the most popular HTML minifi cation techniques. Some of these  such as  removing comments and excess whitespace  are quick and painless. Others  such as the removal of  attribute quotes or closing tags  can cause compatibility issues if you are not careful, and you should  always be mindful of the Document Type Declaration  DTD, or doctype  that you are writing for.  Whitespace and Comments  Stripping comments and extra whitespace forms a large part of the minifi cation process.  And,  again, many basic minifi ers stop here.  However, with HTML, even this can be problematic.  In most situations, consecutive whitespaces in  X HTML documents are rendered as a single space.  Consider the following example:   This is a           space   This is displayed identically to the following:   This is a space   This isn’t the case for text wrapped inside   tags, however. Text inside these tags is considered  to be preformatted and is rendered as-is. It’s easy for a minifi er to spot   tags and ignore the  content between them, but the next problem is more challenging.  CSS supports the white-space property, which controls how whitespace in an element is handled.  Consider the following:   This is a        space   This has an identical effect to the   tag — that is, whitespace is preserved, rather than being  collapsed down.  In practice, this property would most likely be defi ned in an external CSS fi le, rather than via the  style tag in this example. So, for a minifi er to determine which elements contain preformatted text, it  would need to parse the CSS and calculate the properties associated with every element. Given the  cascading nature of CSS and the powerful way in which selectors can be specifi ed, this is no easy task.   So, perhaps it’s not surprising that few  if any  of the HTML minifi ers can cope with the  white-space property.  Although, in fairness, some do acknowledge this problem.  The good  news is that white-space isn’t a widely used property. So, for the moment, the best approach is to  check to see if your CSS rules make use of it; then either forgo whitespace compression, or manually  repair your preformatted text afterward.  Attribute Quotes  According to the HTML 4.0 specifi cations  http:  www.w3.org TR REC-html40 intro sgmltut .htmlh-3.2.2 , it is acceptable to omit the quotes from attribute values, provided the value is  limited to alphanumerics, hyphens, and periods. So, it is perfectly valid to say <a href=index.php  title=home> rather than  . Needless to say, removing attribute  quotes will result in invalid XHTML.  c04.indd   64 c04.indd   64  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   HTML Miniﬁ cation  ❘  65  Things get rather messy if you ignore the proviso about which characters are allowed in unquoted  attribute values. In particular, using the forward slash in unquoted values can result in markup  that still validates but fails to render correctly in browsers  according to http:  www.cs.tut .fi ~jkorpela qattr.html . If you use a minifi er that supports this option, ensure that it  understands the situations in which values must be quoted.  Inline CSS and JavaScript  It’s usually good practice to keep as much of your CSS and JavaScript as possible in external  resources, because this increases the potential for caching. Given the logistics of moving inline  CSS JavaScript out of the HTML document, this is almost certainly a task that you need to  perform manually.  On the subject of JavaScript, it’s worth noting that following frequently seen markup is deprecated   and has been for a long time :     Instead, you can simply say the following:     Occasionally the language= property specifi es a specifi c version of JavaScript to be used  for  example, language='JavaScript1.8" , but this isn’t particularly reliable and should be avoided  whenever possible.    and  ,   and    Many web authors consider   to be synonymous with  , and   to be synonymous  with  . They tend to render identically in browsers, so it may be tempting to replace all occur- rences of   with   in a document, as a means to shrink the document size.  Unfortunately, this logic is fl awed. Although   and   may render the same in  common browsers, their meaning is subtly different.   is purely a presentational tag, telling  the browser to render the text in bold, but carrying no other meaning. In contrast,    carries a semantic meaning — it indicates to the browser that the text is strongly emphasized.  Most browsers render such text in bold, but this is purely a decision made by the browser — it is  not a requirement.  Actually, the word “browser” probably isn’t the right choice of words here. There is a wide range  of user agents, of which desktop web browsers are only a handful. The real benefi t to make a  distinction between   and   comes for agents such as audio readers, where there is a  marked difference in meaning between bold text and strongly emphasized text.  In short, replacing   with    and   with    generally isn’t a good idea. This is worth  mentioning because some HTML minifi ers carry this option.  c04.indd   65 c04.indd   65  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   66  ❘  CHAPTER 4  KEEPING THE SIZE DOWN WITH MINIFICATION  Removing title and alt Attributes  Another minifi cation technique not recommended  but is offered by some minifi ers  is the  removal of title and alt attributes. An example might be transforming <a href=" home .html" title="Home">Go Home   into   Go Home  . This certainly cuts down  the size, but at the expense of accessibility and search engine optimization  SEO .  Boolean Attributes  In form elements, it’s common to use attributes that simply have on off values, such as selected  and checked. The standard method to write these is like so:   Red   Blue   Green   However, it’s perfectly valid in HTML 4 to omit the attribute value, as shown here:   Red   Blue   Green   Again, this shortcut is not valid in XHTML documents.  Closing Tags  In many situations, it’s also acceptable to omit closing tags in HTML  but not XHTML  documents,  thus going against everything you were taught about clean markup. The previous example could,  therefore, be condensed further to the following:  Or if you’re happy with the option values being identical to their text labels, you could use the  following:   Red  Blue  Green   Red  Blue  Green  This results in 48 bytes of code, compared to the 104 bytes of the original.  If your conscience allows you to cut corners like this, the savings in size can be quite substantial.  HTML Miniﬁ cation Tools  As mentioned earlier, HTML minifi cation hasn’t yet taken off to the extent that CSS and JavaScript  minifi cation has. That said, there are plenty of tools available to perform it. As with CSS and   c04.indd   66 c04.indd   66  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   HTML Miniﬁ cation  ❘  67  JavaScript minifi ers, the quality varies a lot, with basic tools doing little more than stripping  whitespace and comments  which is still a good start  — or even worse, replacing good markup with  bad  such as removing alt attributes and replacing strong with b .  Two popular HTML minifi ers are HTMLMinifi er  http:  github.com kangax html-minifier   and htmlcompressor  http:  code.google.com p htmlcompressor  . The fi rst is writ- ten in JavaScript and intended to be run via a web browser. The second is a command-line Java  application.  HTMLMinifi er is newer and is still experimental, but tests indicate that it does appear to offer  slightly better levels of compression. It also has the option to include some riskier techniques, should  you be feeling brave. Following are the available options:   ➤ Remove comments.   ➤ Remove comments from JavaScript and CSS blocks.   ➤ Remove character data  CDATA  blocks from CSS and JavaScript.   ➤ Collapse whitespace.   ➤ Collapse boolean attributes  for example, selected="selected" .   ➤ Remove attribute quotes  when it is safe to do so .   ➤ Remove redundant attributes  for example, language="JavaScript" .   ➤ Use short doctype.   ➤ Remove empty attributes  for example, title="" .   ➤ Remove optional closing tags.   ➤ Remove empty elements such as   .   ➤ Remove type="text javascript" from inline script.  All these options are enabled by default, save for the last two, which are potentially dangerous.  HTMLMinifi er also includes a Lint validator that reports on errors and deprecated code.  htmlcompressor is a little less adventurous but is still powerful; and being a command-line tool,  it is easier to integrate into an automated build system. htmlcompressor can also compress XML  documents and can integrate with the YUI Compressor to perform minifi cation of any inline CSS  and JavaScript.   Let’s have a look at the available options:  $ java -jar htmlcompressor-0.9.1.jar -h Usage: java -jar htmlcompressor.jar [options] [input file]                     If not provided reads from stdin  Global Options:   -o              If not provided outputs result to stdout  c04.indd   67 c04.indd   67  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   68  ❘  CHAPTER 4  KEEPING THE SIZE DOWN WITH MINIFICATION    --type             If not provided autodetects from file extension   --charset           Read the input file using                 -h, --help                  Display this screen                              XML Options:   --preserve-comments         Preserve comments   --preserve-intertag-spaces  Preserve intertag spaces  HTML Options:   --preserve-comments         Preserve comments   --preserve-multi-spaces     Preserve multiple spaces   --remove-intertag-spaces    Remove intertag spaces   --remove-quotes             Remove unneeded quotes   --compress-js               Enable JavaScript compression using YUICompressor   --compress-css              Enable CSS compression using YUICompressor  JavaScript Options  for YUI Compressor :   --nomunge                   Minify only, do not obfuscate   --preserve-semi             Preserve all semicolons   --disable-optimizations     Disable all micro optimizations   --line-break     Insert a line break after the specified column  CSS Options  for YUI Compressor :   --line-break     Insert a line break after the specified column  Please note that if you enable JavaScript or Css compression parameters, YUI Compressor jar file must be present at the same directory as this jar.  To get a rough idea of how HTMLMinifi er and htmlcompressor compare, a test was performed  by running the homepages of a couple of well-known sites through them. The level of minifi cation  is obviously heavily dependent on the content and will vary a lot from document to document. So,  although sampling just two websites isn’t enough to get any empirical evidence, it does provide a  general idea of how effi cient HTML minifi ers are. Table 4-2 shows the results of the testing.

The downside is that it reduces  the readability of code. Although on-the-fl y minifi cation is possible, it’s wasteful of resources, and  minifi cation is best carried out once, when the code is deployed.  In this chapter, you have learned about some popular minifi cation tools: YUI Compressor   JavaScript and CSS , Google Closure Compiler  JavaScript , CSSTidy, HTMLMinifi er, and   htmlcompressor. Whichever tools you use, remember that they are not a magic bullet. Your fi rst  step in minifi cation should always be to manually clean up the code, and, in the next two chapters,  you will learn more about writing effi cient and concise JavaScript and CSS.   In Chapter 5, you’ll spend some time looking at the issues surrounding web graphics and image  optimization.  c04.indd   69 c04.indd   69  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   c04.indd   70 c04.indd   70  05 11 12   5:55 PM 05 11 12   5:55 PM   5  Optimizing Web Graphics  and CSS  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Getting to know the three primary image formats   ➤ Achieving high levels of compression   ➤ Cutting down on HTTP requests by using CSS sprites   ➤ Making your CSS leaner  The images used on a website are often created by a web designer or graphic designer, for  whom quality is the primary concern  because this is the standard by which they are usually  judged . So, it’s not surprising that optimization is often ignored. You can frequently cut 10  KB or 20 KB off an image without any visible loss in quality.  If graphic designers are guilty of tunnel vision in this respect, you should be careful not to  fall into the same trap. Although size is your primary concern, and some loss of quality is  probably acceptable, you should resist the temptation to over-optimize — tacky looking  graphics are just as likely to put off visitors as slow loading times.  UNDERSTANDING IMAGE FORMATS  For a long time, two main image formats were used on the web: JPEG and GIF. JPEG  which is  an acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group  were used for photographs, and GIF  which  stands for Graphics Interchange Format  was used for computer-generated images such as icons.   In the mid-1990s, it came to light that the Lempel-Ziv Welch  LZW  compression method  used by GIF was patented, and the search was on for an alternative. In 1996, the fi rst   c05.indd   71 c05.indd   71  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   72  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   specifi cation for a new format, PNG  which stands for Portable Network Graphics , was released.  Later that year, it had become a World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  recommendation, with most  major browsers supporting it by the end of that decade. Although the LZW patent expired in 2003,  PNG had shown itself to be a superior format, and GIF never fully recovered.  Although the roles of JPEG and GIF are well defi ned, PNG’s purpose is vague. The PNG format can  be used as a replacement for both JPEG and GIF. So, let’s start with a review of these three formats.  Because much of this is common knowledge to those with even a basic knowledge of web develop- ment, this examination is brief.  JPEG is a lossy compression method  there is a lossless mode, but it’s not widely supported , and is  well-suited to photographic images, which typically have many different colors and gradients. With  JPEG, there is a trade-off between fi le size and image quality, but even at the lowest compression  level  that is, the largest fi le size , where artifacts are virtually nonexistent, JPEG images are still con- siderably smaller than nonlossy formats such as TIFF  which stands for Tagged Image File Format .  NOTE   With lossy compression, some data is lost during the compression. With  lossless compression, no data is lost during the compression.  JPEG compression levels are usually specifi ed as either a percentage  where 0 percent is the  smallest  fi le size, but lowest quality, and 100 percent is the best quality, but largest size  or a number in  the range 0 to 1. A value of approximately 60 percent to 80 percent is generally considered a good   middle ground for web images.   JPEG  GIF  GIF has been around since 1987 and is commonly used for logos, sprites, and clip art.  GIF images use a color table  also known as a palette , which can hold up to 256 colors. Each pixel  of the GIF image is then replaced by a number representing which of these colors it contains. The  obvious limitation here is that a GIF can contain only 256 different colors at most. But, surprisingly,  this is still often enough — especially because the color table is not preset but allocated from the   colors actually used in the image.  So, for example, the image could contain 256 shades of red.   It’s also interesting to note that GIF compression is based around LWZ, a revised version of the LZ78  algorithm, which as you learned in Chapter 3, “Content Compression,” is used in gzip and deflate.  Because compression occurs in horizontal rows   from left to right , images that contain a horizon- tal color gradient compress worse than those with  a vertical gradient. Consider the images shown in  Figure 5-1. The image on the left weighs in at 25 KB,  whereas the one on the right is only 17 KB.  FIGURE 5-1  c05.indd   72 c05.indd   72  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Understanding Image Formats  ❘  73  PNG  SVG  PNG is a lossless format that was designed as a replacement for GIF after the licensing issues with  LWZ became apparent. PNG uses the deflate algorithm  which itself uses LZ77, which, as you  learned in Chapter 3, is similar to LWZ .  PNG supports both paletted and non-paletted RGB and RGBA  RGB with an alpha channel  images.  Paletted fl avors are often referred to as PNG8  for PNG , PNG24  for RGB , and PNG32  for RGBA ,  with the numbers refl ecting the number of bits per pixel.    ➤ PNG8 is the most similar to GIF, using an 8-bit  that is, 256  color table. In most cases, it   outperforms GIF, making it an ideal drop-in replacement. It’s worth noting that PNG8 sup- ports both paletted and RGBA, making it a potential choice for image alpha transparency.   ➤ The RGB mode  PNG24  is sometimes also used as a lossless alternative to JPEG; although the   large fi le size means this is not commonly used on the web.   ➤ PNG32 is similar to RGB mode but includes an alpha channel. Although this mode isn’t used   much, there are certain situations in which it is the only viable format. For an image with  lots of color gradients that also require transparency, neither JPEG, GIF, nor PNG8 are ideal   because JPEG lacks support for transparency, whereas GIF and PNG8 have limited color  depths . PNG32 handles such images well — but don’t expect the fi le size to be small!  NOTE   Although PNG has been around since the late 1990s, Internet Explorer   IE  has had numerous fl aws in its support for the format, particularly PNG32. For  example, IE 6.0 and earlier versions fail to handle alpha transparency correctly,  whereas IE 7.0 struggles when transparency is used on top of semi-transparent  HTML elements.  See http:  support.microsoft.com kb 265221 for more  information.   The image formats examined thus far all work along similar principles, containing information  on the color of each pixel in the image. What differs is the way in which this information is  encoded.   Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG  takes a completely different approach by using XML to describe an  image in terms of geometrical shapes. If you’ve ever drawn on a canvas in your favorite program- ming language, you’ll be familiar with the idea of specifying the dimensions of polygons, setting a  fi ll color, overlaying text, and so on. Following is the content of a simple SVG fi le:    <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD SVG 1.1  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org Graphics SVG 1.1 DTD svg11.dtd">      <circle cx="100" cy="50" r="20" stroke="black" stroke-width="1"          fill="blue"  >    c05.indd   73 c05.indd   73  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   74  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   This draws a circle on the canvas with radius 20 pixels at coordinates 100 × 50 pixels. The  circle is fi lled with a blue color, and has a black border of radius 1 pixel. Aside from circles,  ellipses, polygons, and text, SVG also supports color gradients, fi lters, blur effects, and drop  shadows.  In many situations, SVG is an ideal alternative to traditional image formats. It can result in smaller  fi le sizes  sometimes, but not always , and  as the name implies  is scalable, meaning that the image  can be resized without affecting its quality.  One of the main reasons why the SVG format is not as widely used as it should be is because of poor  support in IE. While most of the major browsers have had some level of SVG support since around  2005  Konqueror in 2004, Firefox in 2005, Opera in 2005, Chrome and Safari in 2006 , IE did not  begin to offer native support for SVG until version 9 in 2011. Because a sizeable number of your  visitors will still be using earlier versions of IE, the only practical solution if you wish to utilize SVG  fi les is to use content negotiation and serve up a non-SVG version of the graphic to earlier versions  of IE.  While SVG fi les are not affected by traditional image optimization considerations  that is,  compression levels, color depths, interlacing, and so on , the fact that they must be parsed and  rendered by the browser raises its own performance considerations. The larger the XML fi le,  the more shapes must be drawn, and this has the potential to be slower than merely displaying  an image in a format such as GIF or PNG  even taking into account that these formats require  decoding . Particularly costly are advanced effects such as gradients, fi llers, and opacity.  However, provided that you use these sparingly, SVG fi les need not be particularly CPU- intensive to render.   OPTIMIZING IMAGES  Now that you have refreshed your memory about the three main image formats, let’s look at some  of the techniques to keep image sizes down.  Image Editing Software  A bewildering array of image-editing software is available, but one favorite is the GNU Image  Manipulation Program  GIMP   http:  www.gimp.org . It’s free, it works on UNIX, Windows,  and Mac, and it does a good job to compress images. So much so that, although there are a large  number of tools available specifi cally for optimizing images, they rarely result in any signifi cant  reduction in fi le size when run on images saved by GIMP.  Choosing the Right Format  The general rule for using the JPEG format for photography and GIF or PNG for everything else  can serve you well most of the time. But occasionally you encounter images somewhere in  between — often images generated digitally that contain more than 256 colors, or lots of   c05.indd   74 c05.indd   74  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Optimizing Images  ❘  75  gradients. In these situations, trial and error  and a good eye for detail  is the best approach.  Experiment with different formats and different compression levels until you fi nd the best  trade-off between size and quality.  Interlacing and Progressive Rendering  So far, you have learned a bit of background on techniques to keep image fi le sizes low. However,  user perception of how quickly a page loads is important, too, so now think the unthinkable. Let’s  look at a couple of techniques that actually often increase fi le size but can improve the user percep- tion of loading times.  The default compression method for JPEG is called baseline, in which the data is compressed from  top to bottom. This leads to the well-known effect where a large JPEG image starts rendering  from the top downward, as shown in Figure 5-2.  FIGURE 5-2  JPEG also offers a second method of compression, known as progressive, in which multiple passes  are made of the image, each producing higher detail. When loaded in a browser, such images start  out blurry and gradually become more detailed, as shown in Figure 5-3.  c05.indd   75 c05.indd   75  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   76  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   FIGURE 5-3  In terms of usability and user perception of speed, progressive JPEG fi les are generally considered  to be a good thing, especially for those who use slow connections. Progressive JPEG fi les provide a  rough overview of the image quickly, and the fi nal stages of rendering are often unnoticed by the  user. Not everyone feels this way, though. There is the danger that the user is never quite sure if the  image has fi nished loading, or sees the early passes and assumes the image is of a poor quality.  How does progressive rendering affect fi le size? It actually tends to reduce the size slightly;  although this isn’t always the case. Research at Yahoo  http:  yuiblog.com blog 2008 12 05  imageopt-4   suggests that approximately 10 KB is the sweet spot. For images larger than this,  progressive rendering results in a decrease in fi le size. For images smaller than this, fi le size goes up  a little.  GIF and PNG formats both support a similar technique  of which PNG’s is far superior , which is  known as interlacing. As with progressive JPEGs, the idea is to show the image in multiple passes,  each pass adding more detail. With a GIF fi le, the fi rst pass draws every eighth line, the second pass  every fourth line, the third pass every second line, and the fourth  last  pass the remaining lines.   By contrast, PNG uses a two-dimensional interlacing scheme consisting of seven passes. The result is  a much smoother transition with more clarity in the early stages of rendering.  c05.indd   76 c05.indd   76  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Optimizing Images  ❘  77  The downside to interlacing is that it always increases the fi le size — more so for PNG than GIF.  Interlacing is almost always unnecessary for small images, so the dilemma arises only for large PNG  and GIF fi les, which themselves are not common. As always, it’s diffi cult to make hard and fast  rules. You should experiment with and without interlacing on an image to see which you prefer. A  common opinion is that interlacing is unnecessary the majority of the time.  PNG Optimization  Optimization of PNG images can be divided into four steps:   1.  Remove redundant headers.   2.  Reduce the color depth.   For example, switch from RGB to paletted, or reduce the number   of colors in the palette.     3.  Re-implement or use alternative fi lters.   4.   Improve the performance of the LZ77 and deflate algorithms. Sometimes custom   implementations are used.  Let’s look at each of these steps in more detail.  Removing Redundant Headers  This step involves removing meta data that is not of the image itself. As such, there is no loss in  image quality; although whether this step can truly be referred to as lossless is debatable because  data is still being removed.  The PNG format supports more than a dozen additional headers, which are not required to be   present, and many can be omitted without ill effect. Following are prime candidates for removal:   ➤ bKGD — Specifi es a default background color. This option is not used by web browsers.   ➤ pHYs — Gives the intended aspect ratio or pixel size of the image.   ➤ sBIT — Stores the number of signifi cant bits, enabling a decoder  for example, a web   browser  to reconstitute images converted from a lower sample depth.   ➤ sPLT — Stores a suggested palette when the viewer lacks the capability to show the full   intended color range.  image.   ➤ HIST — Contains a palette histrogram, charting how frequently each color appears in the    ➤ tIME — The last modifi ed time of the image.   ➤ cHRM — Stores the X Y coordinates of the primary colors used in the image.   In addition, there are three text fi elds  zTXT, tEXT, and iTXT  that may be used to store textual  information relating to the image. Typically, this includes title, author, description, copyright infor- mation, comments, and so on.  c05.indd   77 c05.indd   77  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   78  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   Reducing the Color Depth  Hopefully, this step is not required because you should already have experimented with setting the  lowest acceptable palette depth.  While it is common knowledge that PNG8 supports binary transparency  that is, a pixel is either  transparent or it is not , less well-known is the fact that PNG8 also supports alpha transparency. If  you have been using PNG32 simply because you needed alpha transparency, now is the time to exper- iment with PNG8. File sizes should be signifi cantly smaller.  The most frequent problem with alpha transparency in PNG32 is the buggy support in earlier ver- sions of IE. Versions 6 and earlier could not handle the alpha channel, and would render alpha  pixels in grey, with less than pleasing results. While IE6 still does not support alpha transparency in  PNG8, it chooses to display such pixels as fully transparent, which is usually more acceptable.  Re-Implementing  or Using Alternative  Filters  At the precompression stage, fi lters can transform the data into a form that can compress easier.   Note that, in this context, “fi lter” has nothing to do with visual aspects of the image such as alpha  channels.  LZ77 looks for repeating sequences, and anything you can do to increase these can aid  compression.   NOTE   Appendix C, “Compression,” provides more detail on LZ77.  Consider the following sequence:  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  With no repeating sections, this sequence offers no scope of LZ77 compression. And yet, there is a  defi nite pattern — each value is one more than the previous.  Let’s apply a fi lter where each value in the sequence is replaced with the difference between itself and  the previous value.  So, for example, the difference between 5 and 6 is 1, the difference between 6  and 7 is 1, and so on.  The sequence now looks like this:  1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1  This is the kind of data that LZ77 loves, and provided that you know the fi lter that was applied, you  can easily reverse it to recover the original string.  Of course, this was a contrived example. Consider the following sequence:    2,3,4,5,2,3,4,5,2,3,4,5  Here, the fi ltered sequence would be as follows:    2,1,1,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,1,1,1  c05.indd   78 c05.indd   78  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Optimizing Images  ❘  79  This actually compresses a little less. You might say that it compresses less for this particular  fi lter — with a bit of thought you could no doubt come up with a more complicated fi lter for which  this sequence did compress better.  PNG currently offers fi ve different fi lters  although the fi rst simply says “no transformation is made” ,  and  rather usefully  a different fi lter may be used on each row of the image. The four remaining  fi lters are as follows:   ➤ Sub — Each pixel is replaced with the difference between it and the pixel to its left  as in the   earlier example .  the previous row .   ➤ Up — Each pixel is replaced with the difference between it and the pixel above it  that is, in    ➤ Average — Each pixel is replaced with the difference between it and the average value of   the pixels above and to the left of it.   ➤ Paeth — This is a much more complex fi lter based around the Paeth Predictor and using   pixels to the left, top, and top left. The details are outside the scope of this book, but if  you want to learn the nitty gritty of Paeth, PNG: The Defi nitive Guide  Sebastopol, CA:  O’Reilly Media, 1999  by Greg Roelofs is, well, the defi nitive guide.  Because these fi lters are preset, there’s no scope to implement your own fi lter. The only scope for  optimization at this stage is deciding which fi lter to use. Although a different fi lter may be used on  each row of the image, it is mathematically impractical to try every possible combination, except on  small images.  Improving Algorithm Performance  Having removed meta data and reduced the size of the raw image, the last possibility for optimiza- tion is in the compression.   As mentioned earlier, PNG uses the deflate algorithm. Just to refresh your memory, deflate uses a  combination of LZ77 and Huffman encoding. LZ77 is a dictionary coder that looks for sequences  of data that match sequences that have already been encoded. Such sequences are then replaced  with a length-distance pair representing the size and offset of the earlier occurrence. Huffman uses  a tree structure  usually referred to as a table  to encode frequently occurring symbols into shorter  representations.  Recall that LZ77 uses a sliding window and searches back only a limited distance when looking  for matches. Although this lowers memory and CPU usage, it does tend to result in matches being  missed. In deflate tools  such as gzip  that enable the compression level to be set, the size of this  window is typically one of the factors that can be changed.  The zlib implementation offers nine levels of compression, but if you’re happy with trading slower  compression for smaller fi le sizes, there’s no reason why you cannot go beyond this. As such, custom  deflate implementations tend to offer the capability to set larger window sizes.  Similarly, the effi ciency of the Huffman encoding is effectively limited by memory. Output from  LZ77 is piped to the Huffman encoder, and the buffer is fl ushed when it reaches a maximum size.  Raising the size of this buffer allows a larger, more organized tree.  c05.indd   79 c05.indd   79  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   80  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   Lossless Compression  Which, if any, of these steps are lossless? That depends on how you defi ne lossless. Generally, loss- less means no loss in visible image quality, but, strictly speaking, step 1 involves the potential loss of  meta data in the image headers, even if this has no effect on image quality.   Step 2 can be lossless or lossy, depending on the situation. Shrinking the palette to remove unused  colors is lossless, but sometimes it may be acceptable to lose a few colors for the sake of size, in  which case loss does occur.  The fi nal two steps are always lossless. PNG optimization tools often contain their own  implementation  of deflate, which outperforms that found in image-editing software. It’s worth noting that such  images can still be viewed correctly by the client — no special decoding method is needed.  GIF Optimization  With PNG generally being a superior format to GIF, there’s no need to spend too much time discuss- ing optimization of GIFs. In fact, GIF offers less scope for optimization, and optimization techniques  tend to be somewhat pedestrian — reducing the size of the palette to a visually acceptable level and  removing unnecessary meta data.  GIF supports three sets of text-format meta data  usually referred to as extensions , and each may appear  multiple times in the fi le. They are Comment, Plain text, and Application. All may safely be removed.  A discussion of GIF optimization would not be complete without a quick look at animated GIFs.   However, many developers are still scarred by their extensive misuse in the early days of the web.    Reducing the number of frames is usually the fi rst step — the less the better, although, of course,  quality will suffer. When possible, you should also use frame differencing  also known as  inter-frame transparency . Using this technique, each frame contains only the pixels that have  changed from the previous frame.  JPEG Compression  JPEG compression is something new and quite different from the LZW family of encoding schemes.  Whereas LZW and LZ77 perform lossless encoding, JPEG encoding is intentionally lossy — this is  where most of the savings occur. Unfortunately, JPEG compression is a signifi cantly more compli- cated technique than deflate or LZW, and a detailed explanation is outside the scope of this book.  So, let’s settle for a brief overview.  NOTE   Appendix C, “Compression,” provides more detail on LZ77.  Compression Internals  The fi rst step in compression is to convert the image from RGB to YCbCr  where “Y” is the bright- ness, “Cb” the blue chrominance, and “Cr” the red chrominance . Humans are much less sensitive  to changes in chrominance than brightness, and the YCbCr color space takes this into account,  allowing the image to be compressed more without a noticeable loss in quality.  c05.indd   80 c05.indd   80  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Optimizing Images  ❘  81  To achieve this compression, down-sampling is then applied to reduce the resolution  and, thus,  the level of detail, and the size  of the Cb and Cr components. The JPEG format supports numerous  ratios of sampling, of which the three most common are: 4:4:4  no resampling , 4:4:2  resampling  on the horizontal , and 4:4:0  resampling on both the horizontal and vertical .   Next, the image is split into 8 × 8 pixel blocks, and a Discrete Cosine Transform  DCT  is applied  to each pixel in the block, resulting in a frequency domain. While the math involved in this step is  well beyond the scope of this book, the result is a two dimensional grid in which each frequency in  the image is plotted against its magnitude — low frequencies appear at the top left of the grid, and  high frequencies appear at the bottom right. Quantization  that is, compressing a range of values  to a single quantum value  is then applied. Because the DCT tells you the relevance of each value,  you can apply more quantization to lower-frequency values, and use less quantization for the higher   frequencies. The result is that less signifi cant data is compressed more than more signifi cant data.  It’s at this stage that the compression level set by the user  typically offered as a percentage  comes  into play, with a lower value resulting in more quantization.   NOTE   The terminology here can be rather confusing. Some utilities such as  GIMP refer to this setting as “quality” and use a percentage, whereas higher val- ues mean higher quality. Other tools use a number between 0 and 1. Still others  call the setting “compression level” and lower values mean higher quality. For  consistency, the setting will be referred to here as “quality” or “quality level.”  The fi nal stage is to pass the quantized data through a modifi ed Huffman encoder.  Optimization  What does this all mean in terms of optimization? Well, in addition to the quality level, you also  have the ability to choose which sampling method to use. Although 4:4:2 tends to be the default  ratio, there are situations in which better overall compression can be achieved by using 4:4:4 in  combination with a lower quality level. This is typically the case in images with small amounts of  fi ne detail, such as images with text on them.  From this  albeit basic  understanding of JPEG compression, you can also draw some conclusions  about the types of images that compress well, and methods to improve the compression ratio:   ➤ JPEG fi les excel with gradual changes in color  the exact opposite of PNG and GIF fi les .   As such, adding a small amount of blur to produce softer edges can aid the compression  process.   ➤ Similarly, reducing the color saturation produces smoother color transitions, leading to    ➤ Decreasing the contrast lowers the range of brightness, which again allows better    better compression.  compression.  Admittedly, none of these techniques is hugely practical because they mean altering visible aspects of  the original image. But they’re still useful to know.  c05.indd   81 c05.indd   81  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   82  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   It’s also important to remember that acceptable quality levels vary from image to image. One image  may show no visible artifacts at, say, 60 percent quality, whereas another may look bad. This makes  it diffi cult to do any sort of batch resampling of JPEG fi les, and for the best optimization, the human  eye is still no match for a machine.  It should also be noted that because JPEG is a lossy format, resaving a JPEG — even if no changes  to quality compression are made — still results in loss of information. Ideally, the original image  should be stored using a nonlossy format  such as some fl avors of PNG or TIFF, or even an applica- tion’s native format, such as GIMP’s XCF  and converted to JPEG as the fi nal stage in publishing.  Zonal Compression  Although having fi ne-grained control over the level of compression used for a JPEG fi le is useful,  it can be somewhat infl exible because the same level of compression is applied to every part of  the image. Zone compression  also referred to as spatial, weighted, or regional compression  is a   technique whereby different parts of an image are compressed at different levels. This can lead to  lower fi le sizes and better quality in the parts of the image that matter.  Zonal compression is ideally suited to JPEG photography where a main subject is set against a less  important background — outdoor shots are a prime example.  In the photograph shown in Figure 5-4, the main focus is the black cat. Although it’s nice to appre- ciate the clarity of the weeds in the background, these are of secondary importance. You can reduce  the fi le size signifi cantly by applying a higher level of compression to this region.  FIGURE 5-4  Although GIMP does not support zonal compression, both Adobe Photoshop and Fireworks do.  In Fireworks, you fi rst select the region you want to keep at a higher quality using the Lasso tool,  and then save it as a JPEG mask  Modify ➪ Selective JPEG . The masked area is highlighted in a   different color, as shown in Figure 5-5.  c05.indd   82 c05.indd   82  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Optimizing Images  ❘  83  FIGURE 5-5  Finally, you can use the Optimize dialog  as shown in Figure 5-6  to set the quality level of the high- lighted region  “Selective quality”  and the remainder of the image  “Quality” .  Figure 5-7 shows the original image with a quality level of 70 for the cat’s face and 20 for the  background.  A low quality level has been used so that the differences in compression are more  pronounced.   FIGURE 5-6  FIGURE 5-7  Figure 5-8 shows a more realistic quality level of 70 for the face and 40 for the background. This  results in a fi le size of 24 KB — a signifi cant saving on the 42 KB size when the entire image is saved  at a quality level of 70.  c05.indd   83 c05.indd   83  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   84  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   FIGURE 5-8  Image Optimization Software  Image-manipulation programs such as GIMP and Photoshop usually do a decent job to create lean  images.  However, sometimes this isn’t the default behavior, and you must hunt around for a “save  for the web” option or something similar.  But there is usually at least some room for improvement.  Sometimes, it is virtually insignifi cant; at other times, it can have a big impact.  There are a number of  usually command-line  tools for optimization PNG, GIF, and JPEG images. Each  has its own fan base, and if you search the Internet, it’s not hard to fi nd “evidence” that any one tool  is better than the others. The differences tend to be small, though, and given what Disraeli had to say  about statistics  although Mark Twain attributed “lies, damn lies, and statistics” to Disraeli, the phrase  doesn’t appear in any of Disraeli’s writings , no attempt has been made by the author to quantify the  performance of each of these tools. You should just go with the one you feel most comfortable with.  Following is more information about a few of these tools:   ➤ PNGOUT  http:  advsys.net ken utils.htmpngout  is a freeware tool, available for  Windows and Linux. It uses a custom implementation of the deflate algorithm, which  results in better compression, at the expense of speed.   ➤ pngcrush  http:  pmt.sourceforge.net pngcrush   is an open source tool for manipu- lating PNG images. One of its most useful features is a “brute force” mode in which it will  attempt every possible combination of optimization options to fi nd which give the best   smallest  fi le size.   ➤ advpng  part of AdvanceCOMP, at http:  advancemame.sourceforge.net comp-readme  .html  also uses a custom implementation of deflate, this time from the 7-Zip program.  OptiPNG  http:  optipng.sourceforge.net   is an improved version of pngcrush,  offering automatic reduction of bit depth and color palette. It also features a “brute force”  mode, which outperforms pngcrush in many ways.   ➤ RIOT  http:  registry.gimp.org node 20778  is a Windows-only plug-in for GIMP that   offers a huge array of optimization techniques for PNG, GIF, and JPEG.  c05.indd   84 c05.indd   84  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Optimizing Images  ❘  85   ➤ GIFSicle  http:  www.lcdf.org gifsicle   can be used on both animated and inani-  mate GIFs to remove comments, redundant colors, and so on.   ➤ JPEGTran  http:  jpegclub.org   can strip comments and other meta data, and can    perform lossless editing.  Data URIs  One of the most exciting recent developments  actually the idea has been around since 1998, but it’s  only in recent years that browsers have started to support it  is the data URI scheme. This scheme  enables data  such as images  to be embedded inline in web pages, rather than from an external  source. The syntax is as follows:  data: ;base64,   Following is an example:  <img src="data:image gif;base64,R0lGODlhDAAKAMQAAAS A         zI7ccj7MMs7spRzKFlvMSavkid7ysgDMAKfihgjCBtjxrbvplmTRUEr      NO+X2t0TSNh7HGADFAADYANbvpd7vrWXTUQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA      AAAAACH5BAEHAAEALAAAAAAMAAoAAAUmYCCOZElChjlCRaGKw4K8AnW80PSYVa      RcCYaJsJhMHK GBCB8OUMAOw==" width=12 height=10>  Of course, the advantage is that by embedding the image data inline, you cut out a HTTP request.  You can even use data URIs in CSS, rather than directly in the HTML, thus taking advantage of  caching.  As you’ve probably guessed, though, there are downsides. Firstly, although all the major brows- ers do now support data URIs, IE 7 and earlier versions  which still make up a signifi cant share of  the market  do not. The workaround here is to load a different version of the CSS  not using inline  images  for such users, either through the use of CSS conditional comments, or back-end PHP code.  Secondly, as you might have noticed from the previous example, the image data needs to be base  64 encoded, which typically increases the size by approximately one-third. There’s also the matter  to convert the data into base 64; although this is easily achieved with PHP or other scripting lan- guages, as shown here:  <? php   $contents = file_get_contents $file ;   $base64   = base64_encode $contents ;  ?>  It should also be noted that IE 8 imposes a 32-KB limit on the length of the URI string.  Favicons  Creating a high-performing website means looking at all aspects of page loading times, not just  the low-hanging fruit. Favicons  the fi lename is actually favicon.ico  are a prime example. These  small images are so often overlooked, yet there are a few things you can do to improve them.  c05.indd   85 c05.indd   85  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   86  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   The fi rst thing to appreciate is that browsers will request them no matter what. So, even if you don’t plan  to use a favicon, it’s better to return a 200 OK  or even a 204 No Content  than a 404 Not Found. The  situation can be improved further by setting far-future Expires Cache-Control headers on .ico fi les.  The standard way to specify the favicon is via a link tag in the document head:     But because browsers will just request  favicon.ico anyway, if you omit the tag, is there any real  benefi t to using it? Unless you want to use a different name for your favicon, the answer is “no” —  quite the reverse, in fact. With no link to the favicon in the HTML document, most browsers will  request  favicon.ico toward the end of the page loading process. However, if a favicon link is  present, it will be requested near the beginning of the page loading process. So, although there is no  net change in page loading time, leaving out the favicon link should cause a perceived increase in  speed  and trim a few bytes off the size of your HTML document .  Supported File Formats  While the ICO fi le format is the standard way of storing favicons, many browsers support other  formats too. PNG, GIF, and JPEG are supported by Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari  but, note,  not Internet Explorer ; while Firefox, Chrome, and Opera also support animated GIFs. Because of  IE’s limitations, ICO is the most widely used format, and there is generally little to be gained from  attempting to deliver, say, a PNG favicon for non-IE users and an ICO fi le for IE users.  Despite what  many people think, ICO fi les do support alpha transparency — you are not stuck with PNG.   If you do decide not to use the ICO format, the MIME type for the favicon can be explicitly set like so:  <link id= "favicon" rel= "shortcut icon"  type="image png"     href= " favicon.ico">  The offi cial MIME type for ICO fi les is image vnd.microsoft.ico, but it’s interesting to note that  this causes problems in IE, and is best omitted.  Keeping the Size Down  Keeping the size of the icon down is worth exploring, too. Favicons can be created at various sizes,  but 16 × 16 pixels is the most common.  Anything up to 48 × 48 pixels is commonly seen.  You  should prefer 16 × 16, partly because of the smaller fi le size, and partly because your icon should be  understandable at these dimensions. There’s no point to create a beautiful icon at 48 × 48 if no one  can understand what it is meant to be when a browser resizes it to 16 × 16.  Icon images are paletted, so one of the points made in the earlier discussion on GIF and PNG8 holds  true — try to keep the number of colors down. Also, try to keep the fi le size of the favicon low;   anything more than 1 KB or so is too big.  Eliminating the HTTP Request  One of the reasons that favicons are so frustrating for those who care about performance  aside  from the fact that they can’t be disabled  is that they result in an additional HTTP request. Because  the icon is usually small, the overhead to issue the request is relatively high.   c05.indd   86 c05.indd   86  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Optimizing Images  ❘  87  To that end, there are a few techniques to eliminate the HTTP request. They all have their problems,  though, and this is probably a case in which the simplest solution is the best — just use far-future  Expires headers, and accept that there will still be a favicon request from clients without a primed  cache. Still, for the sake of completeness, let’s take a brief look at a couple of techniques.  The fi rst is to use a data URI, like so:  <link id= "favicon" rel= "shortcut icon" type= "image  png"     href= "data: image  png; base64,....==">  As you have already seen, support for data URIs is not universal, with Internet Explorer  IE  being  the main problem. You could get around this by using IE conditional comments, such that a tradi- tional favicon.ico is used for IE, and data URIs for other browsers — but, in some ways, this is  a step backward. At least with a favicon you can ask the browser to cache it for future use. With  a data URI, you have the overhead to contain the embedded icon in your HTML documents with  every request.  Moving the data URI into an external style sheet is one way to increase the chances of it being  cached. You could set it as the background image of the element with ID favicon. This is an even  less supported method, though, and appears to be handled inconsistently between browsers.  Finally, if you’re happy with not having a favicon, another option is to point the href to a resource  that has already been loaded  or is in the process of being loaded . Because the resource is already  being requested, this won’t cause an additional HTTP request. Following is an example:  <link id= "favicon" rel= "shortcut icon" type= "image  png"     href= " style style.css">  Intentionally feeding the browser a resource that you know it wouldn’t parse as an icon seems the  wrong thing to do, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior. But, in practice, this method  seems to work well.  Using Lazy Loading   Lazy loading is a term generally applied to the loading of resources as they are needed, rather than  in anticipation of them being needed at some point. In the context of images, this usually means not  automatically loading images that fall below the page fold, and, thus, are not visible on the initial  page load. As the user scrolls through the page, the missing images are loaded as needed. Lazy load- ing can be implemented in JavaScript.  The benefi ts are obvious. By loading only the images needed immediately, you can cut down sig- nifi cantly on the volume of data that must be sent to the client. To the user, it appears that the page  has loaded quicker. Of course, if the user scrolls through the rest of the page, the images will still be  loaded anyway, but lazy loading results in the browser’s page loading feedback  for example, a turn- ing wheel or loading bar  fi nishing earlier, and these feedback cues are an important part of a user’s  perception of speed.  Don’t underestimate the effect on data transfer with this method, either. A large number of your  visitors won’t scroll past the page fold, and if you have a signifi cant number of images lower down   c05.indd   87 c05.indd   87  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   88  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   the page, the bandwidth savings will be considerable. Not only that, web server processes will be  freed up quicker, resulting in a lighter load on the web server.  There is, of course, a downside. There’s always latency involved in sending HTTP requests and  receiving a response — more so when a connection must be established fi rst. When lazy loading is  used for images, there can be a noticeable fl icker — the user scrolls the hidden part of the page into  view, and it might be half a second or so before the image loads. This can have a negative effect on  the user’s perception of the site.  Still, lazy loading is an idea that is worth looking at — particularly if you have a large number  of images below the fold. Both YUI and jQuery have lazy loading plug-ins, or you can write your  own — but be careful to cover all situations in which additional content may come into view   for example, resizing of the browser window, removing resizing dynamic elements on the page,  scrolling, and so on .  Avoiding Empty src attributes  As back-end code has grown more and more complex, the opportunities for accidentally outputting    tags with empty src attributes have increased. Consider the following example,:   ">  If the $image variable is not set, you end up generating an empty src attribute. It would seem   logical that browsers should ignore image tags if no source URL is given, but the reality is   surprising. Firefox 3.5 and later will not issue a request; Opera will not issue a request; but  Safari, Chrome, and IE will.   In the case of IE, a request is made to the parent directory. Thus, if the current URL is http:   www.example.com news articles.html, a request will be made to http:  www.example.com  news . Most likely, this URL will return an HTML document or a 404 error rather than an image,  so the response will simply be ignored.  With Safari and Chrome, a request is made to the current URL — http:  www.example.com  news articles.html in the previous example.  While browsers have the sense not to attempt to parse HTML documents or error pages as images,  this behavior still results in an additional HTTP request. Equally troublesome is the impact it could  have on the server, because the number of requests on the URL is potentially being doubled. For a  heavily scripted page, this could cause a signifi cant increase in server load.  Setting Appropriate Width and Height Attributes  The dimensions of an image can be specifi ed either via the width and height attributes of the    tag, or through the width and height CSS properties. But since the page will apparently load just  fi ne without them, why not keep your code slim by leaving them out?  c05.indd   88 c05.indd   88  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Optimizing Images  ❘  89  The problem is that, without these attributes, the browser has no way of knowing the image  dimensions  until it begins to load them. As each image is loaded, the browser must redraw the page to accommo- date them. The result is the often seen effect where content jumps around on the page as it is loading.  By specifying the width and height of each image, the browser immediately knows how much screen  space the images will occupy, and can allocate appropriate space for when they are fi nally loaded.  The result is a much smoother page loading.   You should ensure that the width and height that you specify match the dimensions of the image.  It’s not uncommon for web masters to intentionally scale images by setting larger or smaller   dimensions, but the results are not good. Scaling images up in this way results in a noticeable drop  in quality, while scaling down is ineffi cient. The image fi le that is being requested will be larger than  is necessary. For best results, always resize images with image-editing software  such as Gimp or  Photoshop  fi rst, and set the correct width and height in your mark-up.  Using Image Maps  As you learned in Chapter 1, “A Refresher on Web Browsers,” cutting down the number of  resources on a page is one of the main ways to boost performance. However, although you may have  merged your CSS and JavaScript fi les, there will typically still be numerous images. Earlier in this  chapter, you learned about reducing the size of images, and now it’s time to look at reducing the  number of images requested.  Image Maps  In a normal image link, the whole graphic becomes a clickable link to the destination. Image maps are  a popular technique for mapping specifi c parts of the image to different destinations.  Actually, there  are two forms of image maps — client-side and server-side — but the former is much more  common.  Because of this, a reference to just an “image map” actually means “client-side image map.”   A common use of image maps is for hyperlinking different parts of a map, as shown in the   screenshot of http:  time.gov in Figure 5-9.  Moving the mouse around different parts of the image  causes the name of the time zone to be  displayed at the  bottom left, and the link URL to change to a location  showing the time in this particular zone.  The HTML  for creating this image map is somewhat tedious, with  each region being a polygon described by a series of  coordinates.   In this situation, an image map was the obvious choice —  it would have been impractical for the map to have been  composed of multiple images, one for each time zone.  However, there are situations in which the obvious choice  is a series of adjacent images, and, in these cases, an image  map can be used to reduce these images to one.   FIGURE 5-9  Consider the icons shown in Figure 5-10.  FIGURE 5-10  c05.indd   89 c05.indd   89  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   90  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   It’s not too diffi cult to imagine these six icons forming part of a toolbar on, say, a social  networking site. The HTML might look something like this.  Yes, alt and title attributes have  been omitted — it’s for clarity though, not laziness,                            Because they sit adjacent on the page, these icons are ideal  candidates for an image map.   First, you combine them into a single image using GIMP, as  shown in Figure 5-11, and then save it as a PNG8 fi le.  Next, you create the image map, as shown here:                   FIGURE 5-11     As you can see, the image map consists of a series  of   tags that defi ne hotspots in the image —  regions that will be clickable. Numerous shapes are  possible, but a rectangle is the natural choice here,  and the four coordinates specify the bottom-left  X,Y and top-right X,Y coordinates of the  hotspot   with the origin being the top left of the image .  The end result is indistinguishable from the original,  but you’ve reduced the number of images from six to  one, and along the way saved a few kilobytes — the  six individual images totaled 11,092 bytes, whereas  the sprite weighs in at just 4,461 bytes.  Figure 5-12 shows a waterfall view of the original  page loading  using IE 7 and a DSL connection .  Ignoring favicon.ico, you have seven requests in  total and a loading time of 1.16 seconds. Now, take  a look at Figure 5-13 to see the effect of using the  image map.  FIGURE 5-12  FIGURE 5-13  c05.indd   90 c05.indd   90  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Sprites  ❘  91  Here, the number of resources has dropped to two, and the loading time is down to 0.62 seconds —  a saving of approximately one-half of a second.  If all this seems too good to be true, it might just be. There are a few problems with using image  maps:   ➤ Navigation breaks for users on text-based browsers  or those who have images turned off ,   and may cause accessibility issues for text-to-speech engines.   ➤ Mouse-over effects become problematic.    ➤ Images must be adjacent.  Of these, the fi rst should be the biggest drawback. In practice, it tends to be the second and third  that discourage web masters.  Luckily, there is a much more powerful technique for merging images.  CSS SPRITES  The CSS background-image property enables you  to set an image to be used as the background of a  given element. One of the neat things about CSS  backgrounds is that an offset for the image may be  given using the background-position property.  Take a look at the example in Figure 5-14.  Figure 5-14 shows an image that measures 554   pixels wide and 394 pixels high. To display this as a  background image, you can use the following code:  FIGURE 5-14        .mybackground {        background-image:url ' images flowers.png' ;       width: 554px;        height: 394px;     }        However, using background-position, you can  display only a section of the image. Now pick an  arbitrary region inside the image, as shown in  Figure 5-15.  The upper-left coordinates of the highlighted area  are 193 pixels and 100 pixels, and the region is 95  pixels wide and 71 pixels deep. Thus, consider the  following:  FIGURE 5-15  c05.indd   91 c05.indd   91  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   92  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS         .mybackground {         background-image:url ' images flowers.png' ;         background-position: -193px -100px;       width: 95px;         height: 71px;         border: solid 1px black;     }        For added clarity, a small border has been put around the div. As shown in  Figure 5-16, when you load this in a browser, only the selected region of the   background image is shown.  FIGURE 5-16  Perhaps you have already surmised how background-image and  background-position could be used to great effect. You can join together multiple images into  one larger montage, and then selectively show regions of this montage in the appropriate place.  This slashes the number of image requests, and the montage — or sprite, as it is more commonly  called — is usually signifi cantly smaller than the sum of the images it contains.  Earlier in this chapter during the discussion on image maps, you saw  how to combine six icons into a single fi le  as shown in Figure 5-17 ,  with the intention of using a client-side image map.  FIGURE 5-17  Let’s try this again; only this time, using CSS sprites.  In the previous example, you set the background for a div element, but things are trickier for links.  If you set the background for the   element, like so, nothing is shown:          With no content inside the anchor tags, the element takes up zero screen space, even if you use  width height attributes in CSS. You can get around this by setting the display: block, but that  causes your icons to display on new lines.  One solution is to use an   element inside the anchor, and assign a CSS class to this. You can’t  leave the image blank, though, so instead, you use a holding image — a 1 × 1 pixel transparent gif   with an alt attribute for the benefi t of those with images turned off , as shown here:          Thus, the full code looks like so:         .sprite {         background-image:url 'imagemap_nav.png' ;         width: 37px;         height: 44px;  c05.indd   92 c05.indd   92  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Sprites  ❘  93       }      .sprite_games {     background-position: -4px -0px;}     .sprite_videos {    background-position: -41px -0px;}     .sprite_mail {      background-position: -78px -0px;}     .sprite_calendar {  background-position: -115px -0px;}     .sprite_search {    background-position: -152px -0px;}     .sprite_help {      background-position: -189px -0px;}      img {       border:0;    }      <img alt="games" class="sprite sprite_games"       src="holder.gif">   <img  alt="videos" class="sprite sprite_videos"       src="holder.gif">    <img alt="mail"  class="sprite sprite_mail"       src="holder.gif">   <img alt="calendar" class="sprite sprite_calendar"       src="holder.gif">    <img alt="search" src="holder.gif" class="sprite       sprite_search">   <img alt="help" src="holder.gif" class="sprite       sprite_help">   Two CSS class selectors have been used for each anchor tag — one containing “core” attributes of  the sprite and the other containing specifi cs for the region in question. Although this isn’t essential,  it keeps your CSS rules slim and is the logical thing to do.  The advantages would not have been so  clear-cut if the icons had not been of identical sizes.   The downside to this approach is that the   elements are largely redundant. You can eliminate  the need for a 1 × 1 pixel holding the image and remove the   element completely with a little  extra thought — either by giving the anchor tags the block display property  inline-block , or by  using float positioning  for example, float:left .  Alternatively, since it is common practice to hold navigation links inside a styled list  this approach  degrades well in older browsers and has more semantic meaning , you can often just apply the back- ground sprite to the   element, as shown in the following example:                    . . . .  CSS sprites have a few obvious advantages over an image map:   ➤ The images no longer must be adjacent. Although the six icons are side-by-side in this exam-  ple, they could just as easily be scattered across the page.   ➤ Each image can be used multiple times, in different places.  c05.indd   93 c05.indd   93  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   94  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS    ➤ You retain the ability to set an alt attribute for each image, thus improving accessibility.  Google is one of the biggest names to use CSS sprites and does so effectively. In fact, the majority of  the images used on google.com are contained in a single sprite, as shown at http:  www.google .com images srpr nav_logo13.png.  No doubt you can recognize many of these images from the various parts of the Google site.   Sprite Strategies  The Google master image also raises an interesting implementation issue. With only a few of the  sprites appearing on any one page, there’s a performance hit when the master image is fi rst retrieved.  The master image is currently 28 KB, whereas an image containing just the sprites used on a partic- ular page would be one-half that. Certainly, this is bad for performance in the short term — a user  who visits google.com, does a basic web search, and then leaves, has downloaded an unnecessarily  large image. But in the long term, the big master image does improve performance.   Deciding on which images to place in the master sprite is tricky and should be based on an analysis  of client usage patterns. Although you certainly want to place core icons used on every page in your  master image, it may make sense to place lesser-used images in a separate master image, or even not  sprite them at all. Although a master fi le containing every image used on your site is benefi cial for  devoted visitors, the large fi le size will punish the casual visitor. Keeping fi rst-time visitors on your  site is almost as important as getting them to visit in the fi rst place, and a bulky master image won’t  do much to help that cause.  Repeating Images  A common use of background images is to tile a much smaller image horizontally or vertically  or  both . As shown in Figure 5-18, Microsoft’s current homepage provides a neat example of this.  FIGURE 5-18  c05.indd   94 c05.indd   94  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Sprites  ❘  95  The actual image used for the red-yellow gradient is a single pixel wide, as shown in  Figure 5-19.  However, the gradient is tiled horizontally using the background-repeat property, as  shown here:   div.h15-header {         background-image: url ' global en us publishingimages           office_canvas_bg_top.jpg'  !important;     background-repeat: repeat-x;     background-color: transparent;     border: none !important;     color: FFF !important; }  How do you achieve a similar effect with sprites? Sprites may be repeated vertically or  horizontally  but not both! . The key is their positioning in the master image.   For the Microsoft background image, which was 1 pixel wide and 556 pixels high, you  can place additional sprites below this image, providing the width of the master image  does not exceed 1 pixel  the width of the Microsoft background image . This somewhat  limits what you can place there — another repeating background image is probably the  only practical possibility. An alternative would be to widen the fi rst image  as it repeats  horizontally  to, say, 20 pixels, providing suffi cient width to place some icons below it but sacrifi cing  fi le size a little.  FIGURE 5-19  Horizontal or Vertical?  All this talk of horizontally and vertically aligned images raises a question. In situations in which  you don’t need to worry about repeating backgrounds — and can, hence, arrange your sprites verti- cally or horizontally — is there anything to be gained by choosing one direction over the other?  Because the LWZ compression method  used in GIF and PNG  scans horizontally, there should theo- retically be an increase in compression  or rather the possibility for compression  if you stack your  sprites horizontally.  Again, Figure 5-20 shows the sprites used earlier in this chapter.  The PNG shown in Figure 5-20 has a size of 2,102 bytes. If you were to  align the images horizontally  and again save as a PNG fi le , the size would  be 2,297 bytes.  FIGURE 5-20  So, there certainly is some advantage to aligning vertically, albeit not a big one in this example.  Except in the case of repeating background sprites, it generally doesn’t matter which axis the sprites  are aligned along. So, you may as well use vertical and save a few bytes.  Drawbacks to Using Sprites  Although CSS sprites may seem too good to be true, there are a number of drawbacks to  using them.  c05.indd   95 c05.indd   95  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   96  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   The fi rst is that they are somewhat fi ddly to create and implement — merging images, calculat- ing pixel offsets, creating appropriate CSS rules. If one sprite must be changed at a later date to an  image of different dimensions, this can affect the offset of many of the other sprites. In the section,  “Automating the Process,” later in this chapter, you’ll learn about some useful tools for automating  this process.  A much less common problem  but still one worth noting  is that a GIF or PNG fi le is stored uncom- pressed in memory by the browser. Situations have occurred  albeit not often  in which a huge  in  terms of dimensions  background image — mostly consisting of whitespace — is used. Although  such an image compresses well, and, hence, has an apparently innocent fi le size, it’s a different mat- ter when the browser loads the image.  A disadvantage of background images in general is that when a page is printed, browsers tend not  to include them.  However, the client usually has the capability to override this.  In many cases, this  is actually wanted behavior. Printing unnecessary images slows down printing and wastes ink, but  sometimes these “background” images are an integral part of the page. In such situations, a sepa- rate style sheet for printing  using the media="print" attribute when linked to  can alleviate the  problem.  Finally, you should not lose sight of the big picture. The overall aim is to improve page loading  times, and although reducing the number of HTTP requests is usually benefi cial, this isn’t always  the case. Let’s look at an example.  Say that you have a master image containing four sprites  Van Gogh paintings, actually  that are the  sizes shown in Table 5-1.   TABLE 5-1:  Sprites in Sample Master Image  IMAGE NAME  SIZE  BYTES   Vg1.jpg  Vg2.jpg  Vg3.jpg  Vg4.jpg  44318  35172  35067  57824  The total size of these four images is 172,381 bytes,  whereas the master image is an almost identical size  at 173,354 bytes.  The images chosen were inten- tionally quite big, so no sort of optimization was  attempted on any of them.  Figure 5-21 shows the  waterfall view for the loading of this page.  FIGURE 5-21  Clearly, this 173 KB image is the bottleneck in the loading of the page.  Although you didn’t need  a waterfall view to tell you that.  Would it be more effi cient to keep the images separate and make  use of parallel downloading? With most browsers downloading only two resources in parallel, you  would need to split the four images across two domains.  c05.indd   96 c05.indd   96  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Sprites  ❘  97  Of course, this turns out to be false logic. Although the images would now download in parallel,  they would be competing for fi nite bandwidth. Hence, each one would take longer to download.  The overall loading time would almost be the same as when using sprites.  There is, however, one situation in which this technique would be benefi cial. If the client has more  bandwidth than the server, splitting the images across two separate servers prevents server band- width from being the bottleneck.  Figure 5-22 shows the result of using this technique, and the loading time has almost been cut in  half. Admittedly, situations such as this are rare, but they do help to illustrate the potential danger  of spriting everything in sight.  FIGURE 5-22  Palette Colors  An additional problem with sprites concerns the number of colors. Most likely, you’ll want to create  a paletted master image in GIF or PNG8 format, both of which limit the number of colors that can be  used. And with an image containing a variety of sprites, you may fi nd that there isn’t enough space  in the color table to hold all the unique colors. The result is that the sprites look ragged or crudely  drawn.  This problem can be partly mitigated by grouping sprites with similar color palettes and using   several master images rather than one. An alternative is to use a nonpaletted format, such as PNG24  or JPG — but you’ll likely pay a big price in increased fi le size. If it’s just one image that uses a dra- matically different color palette than the rest, it may simply be best not to sprite it at all. Sprites are  a powerful technique, and you can easily get carried away with it. Learning when not to use them is  an important consideration.  Automating the Process  Creating sprites is a tedious process, but a number of tools are available to automate the process.  These range from simply spriting a series of images supplied by the user, to automatically parsing a  page and then generating sprites and CSS for all images found. Although tools in the latter category  are certainly clever, you may fi nd you prefer a more hands-on approach.   c05.indd   97 c05.indd   97  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   98  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   Following are a couple of favorites:   ➤ CSS Sprite Generator  online at http:  spritegen.website-performance.org , or   available to download from https:  launchpad.net css-sprite-generator  creates a  master image from a list of user-supplied images. It offers the capability to resize images,  align horizontally or vertically, and can output in JPG, PNG, or GIF format. Optionally,  supporting CSS can be generated, too. This is a valuable tool because it is simple, yet  powerful, with plenty of options.   ➤ SpriteMe  http:  spriteme.org   uses the novel approach to run via a JavaScript book-  mark. Simply visit the site you want to inspect, fi nd SpriteMe in your bookmarks, and click  it. The SpriteMe widget then loads on the page, as shown in Figure 5-23. The widget lists all  the images found on the page and notes those that are possible candidates for spriting, and  those that are not  for example, because they repeat both vertically and horizontally . With  just a few clicks, you can generate a master image, and SpriteMe can show you the changes  you need to make to your CSS.  FIGURE 5-23  NOTE   Although SpriteMe is sleek and has many useful features, it doesn’t offer  any control over the automatically generated master image, so you still need  to optimize it manually. As always, you should exercise caution before blindly  accepting the SpriteMe suggestions.  Although interactive tools are all okay, in some situations, you may need to create sprites  programmatically.   For example, consider a dating site on which photos of the ten most recent members are shown on  the homepage. The obvious way would be to select the ten newest members from the database, then   c05.indd   98 c05.indd   98  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Performance  ❘  99  select the primary photos associated with each member, and dynamically generate the appropriate  HTML to display them. A better way   that is, better in terms of performance anyway  would be to  use a cron job to generate this HTML fragment every hour or so, thus cutting down on database  queries. What if you wanted to go a step further and convert these ten images into sprites? Clearly a  scriptable, command-line solution is needed.  NOTE   On UNIX and its derivatives  Linux, OS X, and so on , the widely used  cron utility lets you schedule commands to be executed at specifi ed times. cron  is used for everything from periodically cleaning up temporary fi les, to  updating  spam and anti-virus defi nitions, to generating stats on system load. cron is ideal  for periodically compiling HTML fragments to cut down on the server-side  scripting and database queries. Under Windows, the Task Scheduler performs a  similar role, and can also be used for such web automation.  With a little bit of magic  ImageMagick, that is , this is actually quite an easy task. ImageMagick   http:  www.imagemagick.org   is a suite of command-line tools used for manipulating images,  one of which — convert — can be used to join images together. The syntax can be as simple as the  following:  convert image1.png image2.png image3.png -append output.png  This creates a vertically aligned master image named output.png from the three specifi ed fi les. For  a horizontally aligned master image, just use +append instead of -append.  convert accepts a whole host of other options, too, including the capability to set the image type   for example, paletted versus RGB , color depth, and transparency. Following is an improved version  of the previous command:  convert -type Palette -colors 256 -background Transparent       image1.png image2.png image3.png -append PNG8:output.png.  This specifi es a paletted PNG fi le with a transparent background, and a color depth of 256, which is  probably closer to what you want. Although convert does a decent job to keep the fi le size down,  you may still want to pass the resulting image through something like pngcrush.  Of course, there’s nothing to stop you from using something like the command-line version of CSS  Sprite Generator. However, you may prefer the power and fl exibility to roll your own solution.  C  SS PERFORMANCE  In contrast to the other areas examined thus far in this chapter, there isn’t a great deal to say about  CSS performance. Still, there are a few small areas of interest, and a couple of popular performance  “rules” that deserve some clarifi cation.  c05.indd   99 c05.indd   99  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   100  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   CSS in the Document Head  With JavaScript, it is advantageous to load external scripts as late as possible. With CSS, the oppo- site is true. Most browsers delay rendering a page until the CSS has been downloaded to avoid a  repaint redraw, so it’s usually best to place links to external style sheets in the   of the docu- ment. Unlike JavaScript, these links do not block, and the browser can happily continue with down- loading other content.  Inline versus External  The decision on whether to include CSS inline or as an external fi le boils down to the trade-off  between the number of HTTP requests and cachability. If you include the CSS inline, you eliminate  an HTTP request but increase the size of the HTML document. If you use an external style sheet,  you have an additional HTTP request, but the resource can be more readily cached.  Most of the  time, you don’t want to cache the HTML document because it has been dynamically generated.   Link versus @import  Most of the time, you want your style sheet to be external, but you then have the choice of whether  to use   or @import to load the resource. This is an easy decision. Stick with   because  it is nonblocking, and can enable other resources to download in parallel.   Steve Souders has written an excellent article  although note that it is a few years old  on the subject  at http:  www.stevesouders.com blog 2009 04 09 dont-use-import , showing how differ- ent browsers implement @import, and what happens when you mix @import with  . All cause  blocking behavior to some extent, and because there isn’t a valid reason for favoring @import over    in the fi rst place  old browsers don’t support @import, so it can be used as a hack to stop  them from loading the CSS , the solution is simply not to use it.  Redundant Selectors  Over time, your style sheets can become rather messy and out of sync — duplicate rules are added,  elements are removed from the HTML document, but the developers forget to remove the CSS selec- tors, and so on. The result is redundant selectors adding unnecessary weight to your style sheet. Of  course, in theory, this shouldn’t happen. Your development and deployment process should be rigor- ous enough to ensure that the CSS is kept in sync. But, in practice, it does happen.  Dust-Me Selectors is a popular Firefox extension that can be used to fi nd unused CSS selectors.  However, development of the product seems to have stopped, and it will not work in the latest ver- sions of Firefox.   Instead, check out CSS Usage  https:  addons.mozilla.org en-US firefox addon css-usage  ,  which is an extension for the always useful Firebug. Figure 5-24 shows CSS Usage in action on  kernel.org. Toward the bottom is a link enabling you to export the cleaned-up CSS if you are  happy with the scan.  c05.indd   100 c05.indd   100  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Performance  ❘  101  FIGURE 5-24  The big danger with any automated tool like this is that it might miss rules that actually are being  used. For a global style sheet, you should scan every page of the site to be sure you haven’t missed  a rule that is used on only one page, buried deep inside the site. Even then, you risk missing DOM   elements added by JavaScript, or content that varies based on the user’s country, logged-in status,  and so on. At best, these tools should just be used to fi nd possible candidates for removal, which you  can then check over manually.  CSS Expressions  Avoiding the use of CSS expressions was once one of the most important rules for CSS performance.  But the use of these beasties has been deprecated for a while now  since IE 8, and they were sup- ported only in IE anyway , so there’s no point wasting too much time covering them here.  CSS expressions were a way to set CSS attributes dynamically using JavaScript embedded in the  style sheet. Unfortunately, the rules are re-evaluated every time the browser window is resized  or scrolled, or the mouse is moved. The result is that an expression can easily be re-evaluated   thousands of times during a page view. Although the expressions are generally fairly light, with  this number of executions, performance can suffer.  c05.indd   101 c05.indd   101  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   102  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   You can use expressions that will be evaluated only once, but almost always the same end result can  be achieved using pure JavaScript — which isn’t IE-specifi c and isn’t deprecated.  Selector Performance  The performance of CSS selectors themselves has received a lot of attention in the past few years,  mainly because of some well-publicized benchmarks showing a dramatic drop in performance under  certain conditions.   Selectors are parsed from right to left. Consider the following example:  When the browser hits this rule, it goes through every   element in the page and checks whether  it is the child of a   tag. Then it checks if this div is the child of another div, and if this other  div is the child of an element with ID body. This seems like quite a lot of work, and the obvious  conclusion is that you should keep your chain of selectors short to minimize all this backtracking.  The problem often isn’t as bad as you might expect in practice. Consider the following:  body div div p {      background:red; }  body div div p .highlight {      background:red; }  This time, you match elements only with class="highlight", so, although you have the same level  of nesting, the more specifi c selector means that less elements are going to match. Wildcard selectors  are the most dangerous to use, but, in general, there isn’t a signifi cant performance impact, and it’s  not worth your while to try to optimize your selectors.  What about the benchmarks? Many of these were rather artifi cial examples using deeply nested  selectors with lots of wildcards on a huge DOM. Although it might seem reasonable to assume that  the effect would still be there  albeit to a lesser degree  on a normal page, it turns out things are not  quite that simple.   It seems that many browsers will hit a threshold at which performance drops off signifi cantly. As you  add DOM elements, the time taken to parse the CSS gradually increases in a linear fashion. But after  you get into the tens of thousands of DOM elements, you hit a point in which CSS parsing suddenly  starts to tail off dramatically. So, although these benchmarks are correct in showing that selectors do  affect performance, the magnitude of the effect isn’t quite so signifi cant on real-life sites.  Using Shorthand Properties  Many CSS properties support a shorthand notation that is much quicker to write, which can make a  big impact on the size of the style sheet.  One example is when specifying colors. Generally, a hex triplet is used, with two digits for each RGB  part  for example, F368C4, where F3 is the red component, 68 the green, and C4 the blue . When the  two digits in each part are the same, you can omit one of them; thus, FF99CC becomes F9C.  c05.indd   102 c05.indd   102  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Performance  ❘  103  With the margin and padding properties, the longhand way is to write them like so:  margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:4px margin-left:3px; margin-right:2px  However, this can be simplifi ed to the following:  margin:5px 2px 4px 3px  Notice the order of the values. You start at the top and go around clockwise — so the top margin  fi rst, then the right margin, then bottom, and then left.  If the top and bottom values are the same, and so, too, are the left and right, you can simplify things  further, as shown here:  margin: 10px 5px  With only two values passed, browsers assume that the fi rst refers to the top and bottom margins,  and the second to the left and right margins.  There are many other shorthand notations. Table 5-2 shows some CSS properties along with their  shorthand equivalents.

In many cases, the default value for a property is inherited. Check the online CSS  documentation if you’re unsure.  Doing More with CSS  In many situations, it makes sense to use CSS more rather than less because it’s the most effi cient  option. Certainly, placing style rules in an external style sheet  cacheable by the browser  is  generally a better option than embedding the rules in the HTML document.  The exception is  when there are a large number of rules used only on one page — here, inlining is sometimes  better.   CSS versus Data URIs  With CSS sprites being a better supported way to achieve a similar effect, is there a need for data  URIs? You’ll recall from the earlier discussion of CSS sprites that it isn’t always practical to convert  images to sprites sometimes because of the color table, and sometimes because of horizontal and  vertical repetition. In these situations, data URIs are an excellent solution.  Mouse-Over Techniques  Using CSS, rather than JavaScript, for mouse-over effects  for example, in menus  is a popular  option. Previously, this was the preserve of JavaScript  or even worse, Java or Flash applets . But for  basic effects, CSS is better suited, and can do a surprisingly lot — pop-over windows, image switch- ing, pull-down menus, and so on. For example, to swap an image with another one when the mouse  is moved over it, the HTML and CSS is simply as follows:             span.swap {     background-image: image2.png;     background-repeat:no-repeat;     display:block; } span.swap:hover img{     visibility:hidden; }  Aside from being more elegant, this method works even if the client does not support JavaScript  or  has it disabled . Unfortunately, CSS solutions lack many of the keyboard navigation shortcuts, and  JavaScript still has the edge here.  c05.indd   104 c05.indd   104  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Performance  ❘  105  Creating Rounded Corners  Rectangular boxes are so 1990s. These days, site owners want aesthetically pleasing boxes with  rounded corners. There are a number of ways to achieve these, but most are rather ugly, rely on   creating images for each corner, and possibly the use of HTML tables.  Again, CSS comes to the rescue by defi ning the border-radius property, which can be used to  round the corners of a rectangular box. border-radius fi rst appeared in CSS 3 but had been under  discussion for several years previous. As a result, many browsers had already started to implement  support for it but had used their own naming.   Creating rounded corners in CSS is currently best achieved using rules such as the following:  .roundedcorner {      -moz-border-radius: 5px;     -webkit-border-radius: 5px;     -khtml-border-radius: 5px;     border-radius: 5px; }  -moz-border-radius is Mozilla’s name for the property and is supported by most Gecko- based browsers  Firefox, Konqueror, and so on . -webkit-border-radius is used by  WebKit-based  browsers such as Chrome and Safari, whereas -khtml-border-radius is for older  versions of Konqueror. border-radius is the accepted CSS 3 name, and you should include it for  future- proofi ng — for a time when all the major browsers support this and begin to deprecate  their own naming conventions.  What about IE and Opera? IE began to support only border radii from version 9 onward but  did so using the correct CSS3 property name — so there are no browser-specifi c hacks for IE. It’s an  identical story for Opera, which began supporting border-radius from version 10.5 onward.  In fact, most of the other major browsers now support -border-radius, too, so the browser- specifi c properties are becoming less necessary. For the next few years, it will still be important to  continue to use these hacks, however, to ensure compatibility with older browsers.   What about older versions of IE and Opera? Various hacks are available for these browsers  mostly  involving falling back on images or JavaScript , but another option is simply to ignore them. One  of the beauties of border-radius is that it degrades gracefully — if a browser doesn’t support it, it  simply falls back on displaying the border without nonrounded corners.   CSS3  Rounded corners are just one of the many new cool features offered by CSS3 and are a prime  example of how advances in CSS can solve problems that previously required JavaScript. CSS3 is  modular in nature, and with each module being at a different stage of development, it isn’t simply a  case of asking, “Does browser X support CSS3?” All of the major browsers do now support CSS3,  but to varying degrees. The main browsers to watch out for are IE 7 and 8, which have limited CSS3   support. With IE 9, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, support is much more comprehensive.  c05.indd   105 c05.indd   105  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   106  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   Let’s look at some of the ways in which CSS3 can improve performance.   Multiple Background Images With CSS3, the background property now supports multiple images, which will be displayed on top  of each other  the fi rst image listed will appear at the top , like so:  background:     url " images image1.png"  800px 40px no-repeat,     url " images image2.png"  ,     url " images image3.png"  ;  In some situations this can be a very effi cient way to reduce the size of complex images. Too often,  it seems, you encounter images for which neither palette nor RGB color schemes are wholly suitable  — for example, a company name in a stylized font on top of a photographic image. If you save as a  JPEG, the text will become jagged; if you save in a paletted format, the fi le size will be huge.  One way to solve this is by storing the two parts of the image separately, and using CSS3 to   superimpose them. In this way, you can apply the most appropriate compression method to each.  Even though this does result in an extra HTTP request, the overall saving may be worth it.  Text Shadows On the subject of text inside images, the preferred method is to place a text element on top of an  image using CSS, rather than having the text embedded in the image. Aside from reducing the image  size, this is better for both accessibility and search engines.  If you have highly styled text, this isn’t always possible, but the introduction of text shadows takes  you one step closer  in fact, they were proposed in CSS2, but Safari was the only browser to imple- ment them , and can be used to create surprisingly advanced images.  Figure 5-25 shows an example using the following styling for the text element:  .selector{ color:white; text-shadow:2px 2px 4px 000000; }  The fi rst two parameters specify the horizontal and vertical offset  of the shadow, while the third parameter sets the level of blurring,  and the fourth the color of the shadow.   FIGURE 5-25  Box Shadows Shadows around boxes are aesthetically pleasing, but have histori- cally been rather messy to implement, often relying on tables or a  mess of nested divs, coupled with a handful of small graphics.  CSS3  has changed all this, and box shadows are one of the most popular  and frequently used new features — especially since they degrade well in browsers that do not sup- port them. Figure 5-26 shows an example box shadow, and here’s the CSS for the box element:  FIGURE 5-26  c05.indd   106 c05.indd   106  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   CSS Performance  ❘  107  shadow { box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px 666; }  IE has supported box shadows since version 9, while Firefox has supported the box-shadow   property since version 4.0. Prior to that, the Firefox-specifi c -moz-box-shadow was needed, and it’s  still a good idea to include it for backward compatibility. With WebKit-based browsers  Chrome,  Konqueror, and Safari , the -webkit-box-shadow property is still required. Thus, a more robust  example would be the following:  example1 { -moz-box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px 666; -webkit-box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px 666; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px 666; }  Custom Fonts The @font-face selector fi rst appeared in CSS 2, was dropped in 2.1, and fi nally re-appeared in  CSS 3 as part of the CSS Fonts Level 3 module. Firefox 3.5 supports it, as do Opera 10, Safari 3.1,  and Chrome 4. Surprisingly, IE has supported @font-face since version 5 back in the late 1990s,  albeit using a proprietary font format  ironically called Embedded OpenType, or EOT . The other  major browsers support TrueType  TT  and FreeType  FT ,   In light of these cross-compatibility issues, it’s wise to store two copies of the font on your  server, in both EOT and TT FT format.  Be sure to check fi rst that the licensing on the font  allows you to redistribute it, because this is essentially what you are doing.  In addition, it can be  helpful to provide the font in SVG format for older browsers. The CSS then looks like this:  @font-face {      font-family: "myfontname";      src: url  media fonts MyFont.eot ;   src: url  media fonts MyFont.ttf  format "truetype" ;   src: url  media fonts MyFont.svg  format "svg" ; }     .customFont {    font-family: "myfontname", sans-serif;    }    You start by giving the font a name for internal use  myfontname . The next two src lines then   specify the location of the font fi le for IE and non-IE browsers, respectively. At a later point in your  CSS, you can then use the font name defi ned as you would any other font.  NOTE   Although font fi les are generally small, remember that they also incur the  overhead of an extra HTTP request. Use a custom font only if you really need it,  not for the “wow” factor.  c05.indd   107 c05.indd   107  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   108  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   Linear Gradients Another situation in which images are commonly used for styling is with background gradients on  buttons and text boxes. Typically, a single pixel-wide gradient image is repeated horizontally using  CSS  you saw an example of this in Figure 5-19, earlier in this chapter . Although such images are  usually tiny, they still result in an additional HTTP request.  CSS3 introduces support for linear color gradients, with the option for the browser to fall back on  using an image if it does not support gradients. Unfortunately, the major browsers all use their own  specifi c versions of this property at the moment, so the CSS is rather long-winded. Let’s look at an  example:  .gradient {    background-color: 00F;     background-image: url images gradient.png ;     background-image: -webkit-gradient linear, 0% 0%, 0% 100%, from F00 ,          to 00F  ;    background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient top, F00, 00F ;     background-image: -moz-linear-gradient top, F00, 00F ;    background-image: -ms-linear-gradient top, F00, 00F ;    background-image: -o-linear-gradient top, F00, 00F ; }  This creates a linear, vertical gradient, starting with red at the top, and ending with blue at the  bottom.  You start by setting the background color, followed by a fallback image. Versions of Safari prior to  5.1, and Chrome prior to 6, would annoyingly still load the fallback image anyway  even though  they did support gradients . This bug has now been fi xed.  Next come the browser-specifi c rules. -webkit-gradient is for Safari 4 onward and Chrome 1  through Chrome 9. However, this syntax is now deprecated  hence, there’s no need to explain  each property . For more recent versions of these two browsers, -webkit-linear-gradient is  preferred.  Gradient support was added in Firefox 3.6, in the form of -moz-linea-gradient. IE introduced  gradients in version 10, via -ms-linear-gradient, while Opera introduced -o-linear-gradient  in version 11.10. Eventually, there should be an offi cial, cross-browser property, but in order to  maintain backward compatibility, these browser-specifi c solutions will be around for several years  to come.  Transformations CSS3 introduces both two-dimensional  2D  and three-dimensional  3D  transformations, although  the latter are not yet supported in IE or Opera. Two-dimensional transformations are probably the  most useful  although IE has only supported them since version 9 , offering the capability for you to  scale, rotate, stretch, and move elements.   c05.indd   108 c05.indd   108  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   Looking Forward  ❘  109  As with many new CSS3 features, transformations are currently implemented using browser-specifi c  prefi xes. Thus, to rotate an element by 90 degrees, the following code is needed:  .myrule { transform: rotate 90deg ; -ms-transform: rotate 90deg ;  * IE 9 *  -moz-transform: rotate 90deg ;  * Firefox *  -webkit-transform: rotate 90deg ;  * Safari and Chrome *  -o-transform: rotate 90deg ;  * Opera *  }  Like rounded corners, shadows, and gradients, transformations are exciting because they raise the  possibility of eliminating images  and, in this case, possibly JavaScript , resulting in a lighter page.  LOOKING FORWARD  There are many exciting developments in the fi eld of web graphics on the horizon, and over the next  few years, these should enter the mainstream. In fact, some are already supported to some degree;  although lack of complete cross-browser support  you can guess which browser is behind all the   others  means that none are actually suitable for production use yet.  To conclude this discussion of all things graphics-related, let’s take a look at what the future has in  store.  MNG  APNG  One of the main reasons that the GIF format hasn’t died out on the web  aside from inertia  is  that its replacement, PNG, doesn’t support animation. Although this may seem like an oversight  by the creators of PNG, it was intentional — because they were also developing the lesser known   Multiple-Image Network Graphics  MNG  format specifi cally for animation.  Although the idea of the MNG format began at approximately the same time as PNG, its development  has slowed down, and the format hasn’t caught on. As of 2012, only Konqueror supported the for- mat natively, although plug-ins are available for IE, Firefox, and Opera.  Perhaps part of the reason for the slow uptake is that, thankfully, animated GIFs have fallen out of  fashion. With alternative formats under development, however, it may be that MNG may never enjoy  widespread support.  Animated Portable Network Graphics  APNG  is an extension to PNG, and offers features similar to  MNG. Its chief advantages over MNG are better browser support and a less-complicated format.   Because the fi rst frame of an APNG fi le looks like a regular PNG fi le, browsers with no APNG support  can still display the fi rst frame — thus, there is some degree of backward compatibility. Currently,  Opera and the Gecko-based browsers are the only ones that support APNG natively, although  Chrome supports it via a plug-in.  c05.indd   109 c05.indd   109  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   110  ❘  CHAPTER 5  OPTIMIZING WEB GRAPHICS AND CSS   JPEG 2000 is intended to replace JPEG. But despite it having been around since 2000, only  Konqueror and Safari currently support it natively  IE and Firefox both support it via plug-ins . It  looks as if things will stay this way for a while.   The main advantage of JPEG 2000 will be better compression, offering smaller fi le sizes and higher  image quality. Other goodies include error checking, multiple resolution representations, and   support for alpha channels.  JPEG 2000  SUMMARY  Choosing the right fi le format is an essential fi rst step to optimize your images, and an understand- ing of the underlying compression algorithms used by the three main image formats  PNG, JPEG, GIF   can help you to make further reductions in fi le size.  Each image used in a page results in an extra HTTP request, so cutting down on the number of  images is a worthwhile goal. The two main techniques are image maps and CSS sprites. Sprites are  the best general-purpose solution, but they are somewhat fi ddly to implement.   It’s worth being aware of the way in which selectors are parsed  right to left  and the effect of this  on CSS performance — especially when wildcards are used. Also, ensure that you become familiar  with the shorthand notations available for many CSS properties because these can make your style  sheets signifi cantly smaller in size.  While advances in CSS can be utilized to cut down on the use of JavaScript, there are still many  situations where JavaScript is the only viable solution. Love it or hate it, JavaScript is an essential  part of the modern web  especially so since the birth of Web 2.0 , and an understanding of how to  optimize it is essential. In Chapter 6, you learn all about JavaScript, the Document Object Model,  and Ajax.  c05.indd   110 c05.indd   110  05 11 12   4:40 PM 05 11 12   4:40 PM   6  JavaScript, the Document  Object Model, and Ajax  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Looking at the JavaScript engines used by the major browsers   ➤ Understanding the impact that the Document Object Model has on   performance   ➤ Looking at performance considerations of the JavaScript language   ➤ Understanding how browsers download and execute JavaScript   ➤ Getting some tips for effi  cient Ajax programming  In the late 1990s, JavaScript suffered from a poor reputation among professional web   developers. Too often it was used for fl ashy  but pointless  special effects and was a nightmare  for cross-browser compatibility. Even visiting a particular vendor’s website using its own  browser might have resulted in JavaScript error messages.   The situation has improved dramatically in the last decade, with browser-specifi c quirks   having decreased, along with the need for ugly hacks to get around them. In a testament to  how much things have changed, Ajax  which is built around JavaScript  is now such a big part  of the modern web and works surprisingly smoothly most of the time. There’s also been a shift  in how JavaScript is used, with less emphasis on gimmicks and more on usability. These days,  the majority of big sites  and most Web 2.0 sites  use JavaScript to some degree, often without  it being particularly apparent.  This chapter looks at the performance considerations for using JavaScript and the ways in  which browsers download and execute it. JavaScript is closely related to the Document  Object Model  DOM , and you’ll also learn how the DOM affects page rendering times,  as well as how JavaScript interacts with it. Finally, this chapter looks at Ajax, and ways in  which it can be sped up.  c06.indd   111 c06.indd   111  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   112  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   JAVASCRIPT, JSCRIPT, AND ECMASCRIPT   Before getting into the intricacies of JavaScript performance, it’s worth looking at the history of the  language, including the competing implementations, the offi cial standards, and the engines used by  each browser. Toward the end of this section, you learn about the different approaches offered by  the engines, and the ways in which they aim to boost performance.  A Brief History of JavaScript  The fi rst release of JavaScript was in Netscape Navigator 2.0, in 1995. Originally, it was called  LiveScript, but within a few months, it had been rebranded to JavaScript.  Many commentators have  suggested that this was simply a marketing ploy to cash in on the success of Java, which had become  something of a buzzword.   Naturally, Microsoft was not going to be left behind, and by the following year, the newly released  Internet Explorer 3.0 contained Microsoft’s implementation of JavaScript. To avoid any trademark  disputes, it named its scripting language JScript.  At around the same time, Netscape passed the language to the European Computer Manufacturers  Association  ECMA  standards organization, the international standards organization for  Information Communication Technology  ICT  and Consumer Electronics  CE , which began  formalizing and standardizing the language. The result was ECMAScript, which continues to  undergo regular refi nements and enhancements.  So, ECMAScript is the blueprint for the language. JavaScript and JScript are vendor-specifi c names  for their particular implementations of the language. Although it’s probably more accurate to say  ECMAScript,  most people still refer to the language as JavaScript, and they aren’t necessarily  talking specifi cally about Netscape’s implementation but the language in general.  In this book,  this implementation will be specifi cally referred to as Netscape’s JavaScript.    Surprisingly, the differences between JScript and Netscape’s JavaScript have never been huge, even  in the ugly days of the browser wars. This was no doubt partly because of the neutral role played  by ECMA. Still, there were enough small niggles that writing cross-browser JavaScript was tricky.   However, many of these problems were because of differences in the DOM, rather than JavaScript.    The situation has improved since then. Although differences still exist, they are well known and  can be worked around. With the increased interest in JavaScript, there are plenty of libraries and  frameworks that can accommodate the differences. For the most part, the differences these days  tend to be in vendor-specifi c extensions, rather than incompatibilities in core features.  JavaScript Engines  The major browser vendors have all developed their own engines for interpreting and executing  JavaScript, and this is where most of the exciting development is happening these days. With the  increase in the use of JavaScript at the professional level  as already noted, in the late 1990s, it was  often viewed as a toy for amateur web developers , performance has become an important factor,  and vendors are currently falling over themselves to offer the best speeds.  c06.indd   112 c06.indd   112  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   JavaScript, JScript, and ECMAScript   ❘  113  Firefox  Versions of Firefox prior to 3.5 used the SpiderMonkey interpreter, which had been in use since the  early Netscape Navigator days. Recent versions of Firefox have benefi ted from the addition of several  JIT compilers running alongside SpiderMonkey, which itself has seen numerous enhancements.  TraceMonkey The fi rst of these JIT compilers was TraceMonkey, which debuted in Firefox 3.5 in 2009,  and used  the innovative technique of tracing to produce the majority of the performance gains. One of the  reasons that executing JavaScript is slow is that the language is weakly typed — a variable could  happily contain a string, integer, or fl oating-point number, and it’s diffi cult to predict in advance  which will be used. As a result, compiled code must handle them in a generic way. Contrast this  with C, where variable types are declared in advance, and the compiler can optimize accordingly.  NOTE   Tracing is a relatively new method for improving the performance of  JIT compilers. It works by observing the code as it executes, and from this, it  determines variable types, allowing further optimizations to take place.  In TraceMonkey, the fi rst time the script runs, it does so through the relatively slow SpiderMonkey  interpreter. TraceMonkey watches, determines the variable types, and compiles type-specifi c code.  Execution then switches to this compiled version.  Of course, just because a variable contained an integer value on the fi rst run, it doesn’t mean that  this will always be the case. So, TraceMonkey also inserts type checks into the code. If any of these  fail, execution switches back to the interpreter, and another branch of the code is compiled using the  new variable type.   TraceMonkey has a few shortcomings:    ➤ Only loops are traced. They have the biggest potential for gain, and compiling and running   code that executes only once is often slower than simply interpreting it.    ➤ Code with lots of branches or type changes tends to run more slowly in TraceMonkey   because of the extra time needed to compile these different branches.    ➤ Because tracing is primarily used to distinguish between strings, fl oats, and integers,   TraceMonkey doesn’t offer a signifi cant performance increase for objects.  JägerMonkey It wasn’t long before Mozilla began refi ning TraceMonkey in an attempt to reduce some of its   shortcomings, and the result was JägerMonkey, released in Firefox 4.   As you have just seen, in many cases with TraceMonkey, control must switch back from execution  of native code to the interpreter because of changing variable types. In practice, this happened a lot  more than had been expected. Therefore, JägerMonkey adopts the more traditional “method JIT  compilation” approach used by most other JavaScript engines. Onto this, it then adds tracing to   further optimize loops.   c06.indd   113 c06.indd   113  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   114  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   IonMonkey Looking toward the future, Mozilla is already working on a new JavaScript engine named  IonMonkey. It will essentially be a refi ned and updated version of JägerMonkey, with an emphasis  on adding additional optimization techniques. Initially, IonMonkey was planned for release toward  the end of 2011. This proved to be rather optimistic, but a release should not be far away.  Google Chrome  The impetus for change in Firefox and IE was in part because of the arrival of Google Chrome,  which boasted particularly fast JavaScript execution in the form of the V8 engine. V8 uses a JIT  compiler and compiles directly into native code  rather than a bytecode intermediate, as was the  common strategy in other browsers at the time .   CrankShaft is the name for V8’s current compilation infrastructure, and consists of two distinct  compilers. The fi rst is a quick-and-dirty compiler that does very little in the way of optimization,  but compiles very quickly in order to reduce start-up latency. When a page is fi rst loaded, this base  compiler is used to enable the JavaScript to start executing quickly.  While code from the fi rst compiler is being executed, the second compiler kicks into action. This  compiler is slower, but produces faster code, thanks to numerous optimization techniques. By  watching execution of the code generated by the fi rst compiler, it is also able to determine variable  types, and makes use of this knowledge when compiling.  Internet Explorer  As with Opera, Internet Explorer  IE  has seen a move away from the traditional runtime inter- preter introduced in IE 3, to a just in time  JIT  compiler for performance reasons. The new engine,  Chakra, was introduced in IE 9, and has done a lot to improve the image of IE.  At the time, IE 8’s  JavaScript performance was particularly poor in comparison to that of other browsers.   Chakra introduces a number of innovative features and is particularly suited for today’s multicore  processors. The most signifi cant change is the introduction of a JIT compiler, but because this can be  slow to start up  although the code produced runs faster , IE 9 continues to use an interpreter for the  fi rst run of the script. At the same time, the JIT compiler is started up in the background in another  thread to compile the script. This compiled version is then used for subsequent runs of the script.   This approach makes better utilization of multicore processors  the JIT compiler can run on a differ- ent core  and gets around the dilemma over whether JIT is a better solution than interpreting.  Opera  Until 2009, Opera used an engine named Futhark for JavaScript execution. At the time of its   introduction  1996 , it was the fastest engine available, which was built with the intention of being  small and having a low-memory footprint.  In Opera 10.5, a new engine, Carakan, was unveiled. The new engine refl ects the way in which  JavaScript usage has grown, and this time the primary focus is on speed. For example, whereas  Futhark fi rst compiled scripts into platform-neutral bytecode, Carakan compiles some or all the  script directly into native machine code. This enables it to avoid operations such as loops that   c06.indd   114 c06.indd   114  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   The Document Object Model  ❘  115  are costly in bytecode. In addition, caching of compiled code is performed, further increasing  performance.  The second signifi cant change in Carakan is a move away from the stack-based model of Futhark  in  which instructions are pushed and popped from the stack  to a register-based approach. Instead of a  dynamically sized stack, fi xed-size registers are used, and these can be accessed directly without the  need to move data back and forth from the stack. Tests  by Opera  show Carakan to be about twice  as fast as Futhark.  Safari  As with the other main browsers, Safari has seen a shift away from a relatively slow JavaScript   interpreter to a bytecode interpreter and compiler.   Prior to 2008, the interpreter used was named JavaScriptCore  part of WebKit, on which Safari is  built . The new SquirrelFish  also called Nitro and SF  engine was introduced with Safari 4. As with  other engines of this period, SquirrelFish generates intermediate bytecode and performs most of  its optimizations at this level. It uses registers rather than stacks and supports some degree of type  inference.  Within a few months, there was already talk of an improved version of SquirrelFish, and  SquirrelFish Extreme  also known as SFX or Nitro Extreme  was released the following year in beta  versions of Safari 4. SFX expands on the new approach introduced in SquirrelFish and uses a JIT  compiler to generate native code for faster execution. Other changes include a signifi cantly faster  regular expression  regex  engine  WebKit claims a fi ve-fold speed increase , inline caching, and   better type prediction.  NOTE  You’ll learn more about regexes in the section, “Regular Expressions,”  later in this chapter.  In the last fi ve years, the major browser vendors have invested a great deal of effort into improving  their JavaScript engines. Partly as a result of this, the major bottleneck nowadays in JavaScript- heavy sites tends not to be in the compilation and execution of the language, but rather in the way  that JavaScript interacts with the browser’s Document Object Model.  THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL  The Document Object Model  DOM  is a tree-like structure that describes the relationship between  every element in the HTML document. When a web browser has fi nished retrieving a document, the  HTML is parsed and the DOM constructed, and from this the page is rendered.   After the DOM has been constructed, it is accessible through JavaScript. You can traverse the tree,  enumerate an element’s parent or children, get and set an element’s properties, and even add and  remove sections of the tree. DOM manipulation is at the core of most JavaScript.  c06.indd   115 c06.indd   115  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   116  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   A large DOM affects performance in a number of ways. It generally means a large HTML docu- ment, which takes longer to download, parse, and render by the browser. But the biggest impact is  on JavaScript. Manipulating the DOM becomes increasingly expensive, and some operations cause a  refl ow or repaint  more on these later , which can take longer with a heavy DOM.   So, keeping the size of the DOM down makes for an overall increase in responsiveness. But how  big is too big? As ever, there’s no right or wrong answer, but you can get an idea of what’s accept- able by seeing how the big names compare. They’ve generally spent a lot of time looking into  performance.   NOTE   It would seem that sina.com.cn is an exception, however, because it  has more than 150 KB of CSS and JavaScript embedded in the index page.  An easy way to count the number of elements in the DOM is with JavaScript using the Firebug  extension for Firefox. Simply open up the Firebug console and enter the following:  document.getElementsByTagName '*' .length  Table 6-1 shows the results for the top 20 websites at the beginning of 2012.  TABLE 6-1:  Number of DOM Nodes in Top 20 Websites  NUMBER OF DOM NODES  DOMAIN  Google.com  Facebook.com  Youtube.com  Yahoo.com  Live.com  Baidu.com  Wikipedia.org  Blogger.com  Msn.com  Twitter.com  qq.com  Yahoo.co.jp  Google.co.in  244  430  1,279  884  251  70  638  621  1,431  242  2,370  860  252  c06.indd   116 c06.indd   116  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   The Document Object Model  ❘  117  Taobao.com  Amazon.com  Sina.com.cn  Google.de  Google.com.hk  Wordpress.com  Ebay.com  1,404  1,861  3,710  241  240  317  1,073  There’s quite a lot of variation here, but perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising. The home page of  Amazon.com is a lot busier than Google’s, and it’s inevitable that a richer page will have a larger  DOM. It’s well known that both Amazon.com and Google have invested a lot of resources into  studying performance. Clearly, for Amazon.com, the benefi ts of a rich page outweigh the cost of a  heavier DOM.  So, it’s impossible to give guidelines on what an acceptable DOM size is. In some cases, a heavy  page is justifi ed because it contains plenty of contents to catch the user’s attention, but you should be  particularly cautious of heavy pages that also perform a lot of DOM manipulation in JavaScript.   No matter how big or small, it’s worth reviewing your HTML and seeing if you can simplify the  structure without affecting the visible layout. Although tables are often criticized for creating  bloated layouts, many web developers are also guilty of excessive use of   elements, and use  multiple levels of nested divs where one will do. Content Management Systems  CMSs  are some of  the worst offenders for this.  Manipulating the DOM  In JavaScript,  a common way to access the DOM is in this fashion:  document.getElementById 'id_of_element'   This forces the entire DOM to be traversed until the matching element is found. So, if you intend to  access the element multiple times, it makes sense to cache a reference to the element and use this:  var foo = document.getElementById 'id_of_element' ; foo.style.display = 'none'; foo.style.display = 'block';  Reﬂ owing and Repainting  Earlier in this chapter, you learned that after the DOM has been constructed, the browser then  renders the page. But actually there’s a little more to it than that. The DOM is concerned with   structure, not physical appearance, and after the DOM has been constructed, a render tree is then   c06.indd   117 c06.indd   117  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   118  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   generated. The render tree is similar in structure to the DOM but contains the computed styles for  each element  based on the parsed CSS . After the render tree has been constructed, the output is  then drawn  painted  to the browser.  In many situations, modifying the DOM with JavaScript causes a change on the layout of the page   for example, if you resize a visible element . This triggers a refl ow — the browser must regenerate the  render tree  or at least all parts of the tree that have been affected by the change  and draw it to the  screen. By contrast, a repaint occurs when the DOM is modifi ed in a way that does not affect the page  geometry  for example, if you change the background color of an element . This also causes the render  tree to be updated and the screen repainted.  So, both refl ow and repaint are expensive and take longer as the number of DOM elements in the  page increases. They adversely affect the user experience and give the impression of the page being  sluggish. What can you do to minimize them?  First, let’s look at common actions that cause a refl ow repaint. Reading the properties of DOM   elements  for example, capturing the text entered into a form fi eld  generally aren’t a problem   although see the discussion in the later section, “Browser Queueing” . It’s writes that you  must be wary of. Anything that changes the visible layout of the page can cause a refl ow repaint.  This includes changing the display or visibility of an element, changing its position, color, and  so on — basically any action that changes style properties of an element.   Some of these actions are more visually disruptive than others. Resizing an element at the top of the  page causes a more noticeable effect than changing the color of some text. But all involve repainting  some  or all  of the screen and recalculating the render tree. Because the browser reconstructs only  parts of the render tree that have been invalidated  rather than rebuilding it from scratch , changes  to nodes toward the end of the tree  or with fewer children  can help to minimize disruption.  Modifying the DOM is particularly expensive because this results in both the DOM and the  render  tree being updated. Thus, adding and removing nodes from the DOM should be avoided where  possible.   It’s not all doom and gloom though. In situations in which you need to perform several modifi ca- tions to the same DOM element, you can reduce the number of refl ow repaints that occur. Consider  the following:  var el = document.getElementById 'mydiv' ; el.style.background = 'EEE'; el.style.border = '2px'; el.style.color = 'red';  Normally, this would result in three refl ow repaints. You can get around this by temporarily setting  the element’s display property to none, making your changes, and then making the element visible  again. Having two refl ow repaints instead of three is not a huge change, but is increasingly useful as  the number of changes you’re making increases.  Another option here is to defi ne all these style changes in a separate CSS class, and then just change  the className property of the element. This time, there would be only one refl ow repaint.  c06.indd   118 c06.indd   118  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   The Document Object Model  ❘  119  Yet another option is to use the cssText property to set  or get  the style declarations on an  element, as shown here:  document.getElementById 'mydiv' .style.cssText =      'background:EEE; border-width:2px; color: red'  Again, this only causes one refl ow repaint, and, in some situations, is simpler than declaring a   separate CSS class.  Browser Queuing  Most modern browsers are smart enough to queue changes that would cause a refl ow repaint, and  execute them in a batch. In the example just presented, browsers wouldn’t, in practice, execute three  refl ow repaints. Instead, the operations would be queued and executed as a batch a fraction of a   second later.  There is a catch, though. If you attempt to retrieve layout information about an element, this forces  the browser to execute any queued actions  because it wants to be sure that it is not returning stale  data , and you lose the benefi t of queuing. So, setting a style property on an element that affects its  layout, and then immediately retrieving layout properties of the same element, should be avoided.  In fact, querying layout information on any element that may have been affected by the change will  cause the queue to be fl ushed.  Event Delegation  Often, JavaScript interacts with the DOM through event handlers. You add, say, an onClick  attribute to an element’s HTML mark-up and execute some code when the element is clicked. These  event handlers can quickly add up. Imagine if you need to add a handler to every item in a list, or  every cell in a table. This increases the size of your mark-up, takes the browser longer to initialize,  and consumes more memory.  The solution is event delegation, which makes use of the event bubbling feature of JavaScript.  With event bubbling, when an event is triggered on an element, it bubbles up through each of  the element’s ancestors until it reaches a handler, or the top of the DOM. For example, here’s the  traditional approach:       Item 1     Item 2    . . .     With event delegation, you add the handler to the   element instead:       Item 1     Item 2    . . .     c06.indd   119 c06.indd   119  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   120  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   With no event handlers assigned to the   elements, clicking these causes the event to bubble up  to the   element, where it reaches your handler and stops. In your JavaScript, you can easily tell  which   element triggered the event like so:  function foo e  {         This is the IE way var target = e.srcElement;        Other browsers var             target = e.target;      var target = e.target  e.srcElement      if  target.nodeName.toLowerCase   === 'li'  {            alert "Click li element with ID " + target.id ;      }      e.stopPropagation  ;    stops the even from propagating further for IE9 and  onward only }  IE uses a different method to access the target element than other browsers, but most JavaScript  frameworks accommodate this.  Unobtrusive JavaScript  Just as you use CSS to separate style from content, you can also  to some degree  separate JavaScript  from your document. This is known as unobtrusive JavaScript. Revisiting the event delegation  example, rather than adding the event handler to the   element in the markup, you can use  addEventListener and an anonymous function for a more aesthetically pleasing solution:       Item 1     Item 2    . . .    document.getElementById 'ourlist' .addEventListener "click",       function  e  {       var target = e.srcElement;    The IE way      var target = e.target;    Other browsers            if  target.nodeName.toLowerCase   === 'li'  {                 alert "Click li element with ID " + target.id ;           }      , false  ;  Note that addEventListener   was only introduced in IE in version 9  other browsers have  supported it for much longer . For earlier versions of IE, attachEvent   is needed:  document.getElementById 'ourlist' .attachEvent "onclick",      function  e  {       var target = e.srcElement;    The IE way            if  target.nodeName.toLowerCase   === 'li'  {                 alert "Click li element with ID " + target.id ;           }      }            ;  c06.indd   120 c06.indd   120  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   The Document Object Model  ❘  121  There’s a lot to be said for this approach. It improves maintainability if you have different developers  working on the markup and the JavaScript, and it shifts the weight from the HTML document into a   presumably  external resource where it has a better chance of being cached. You’re much more likely  to be setting far-future expiration headers on your JavaScript fi les than on your HTML documents.  Memory Management  In the old days, memory management wasn’t a big issue for JavaScript developers. That’s not to say  that browsers didn’t have memory leaks  and lots of them , but these were mostly problems that the  vendors needed to deal with, and there was little that web developers could do. The potential cer- tainly exists for JavaScript to be wasteful of memory, but the short lifetime of web pages tended to  stop this from being a problem. As soon as the user clicked to another page, the memory was freed  up again  although note that this wasn’t the case with IE 6 .  With the rise of JavaScript-heavy web applications, things have changed. It’s quite feasible that the  user may spend his or her entire session just on one page, with Ajax being used to communicate with  the server. As a result, ineffi cient memory usage has the opportunity to mount up into something  more signifi cant.  Generally, the most common problem is circular reference — specifi cally, when a JavaScript refer- ence still exists to a DOM node  either directly, or indirectly through closure  when the DOM node  is removed from the DOM, preventing its memory from being reclaimed. If a DOM node is removed  and there are no circular references keeping it or its descendant nodes in memory, there generally  should not be an issue.  JavaScript uses the garbage collection methodology for managing memory. Memory is allocated to  objects, and reclaimed by the garbage-collection process when the object is no longer being used.  To determine if an object is in use, browsers keep a count of how many references there are to  each object. If the number of references drops to zero, the object can be removed  and the memory  reclaimed .  Circular references occur when two objects reference each other, meaning that their reference counts  will never be less than 1  hence, they are not candidates for garbage collection . Although most  JavaScript implementations are intelligent enough to spot circular references between two JavaScript  objects, things get tricky when the reference is between a DOM node and a JavaScript object,  because both use their own separate garbage collectors.  Let’s look at an example using one of the most common sources of such circular references: refer- encing a DOM element from inside an anonymous function attached to the element via an event  handler.    function addHandler   {     var mydiv = document.getElementById "myid" ;          mydiv.onclick = function   {          alert this.innerHTML ;      }    c06.indd   121 c06.indd   121  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   122  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX    . . .       . . .  In this example, the global variable myobject refers to the DOM element mydiv, which refers back  to myobject  via expandoProperty  .The result is a circular dependency between the DOM and  JavaScript. The solution, of course, is to nullify myobject once you are fi nished with it.  By now, you should have a good understanding of the importance of the DOM, and how  interacting  with it via JavaScript can be surprisingly expensive. As noted at the beginning of this section,  DOM interaction tends to be one of the main areas where performance can suffer. But as you will  see in the following section, there is often plenty of scope for improving the performance of purely  JavaScript code.  GETTING THE MOST FROM JAVASCRIPT  Advances in the JavaScript engines of the big browsers have gone a long way toward improving  JavaScript performance. But this is not an excuse for laziness. As a JavaScript programmer, you  should still strive to write optimal code for your website’s visitors. In this section, you discover some  of the most common causes of performance problems in the JavaScript language, along with ways to  effi ciently load JavaScript resources into your documents.  Language Constructs  As the previous section has hinted, it’s generally DOM manipulation that is slow, rather than  JavaScript itself. Nevertheless, there are situations in which JavaScript can perform poorly. Let’s  look at the common cases.  Loops  As with most other languages, loops are a potential source of severe performance degradation  because tiny ineffi ciencies are magnifi ed each time the loop runs. Consider the following  example:  for  var x=0; x < myarray.length; x++  {      . . . }  The problem here is that the number of items in the array is calculated for each iteration of the loop,  which is unnecessary. You can improve the situation dramatically by fetching the size of the array  outside of the loop, as shown here:  var count = myarray.length; for  var x=0; x < count; x++  {      . . . }  c06.indd   122 c06.indd   122  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   Getting the Most from JavaScript  ❘  123  If you don’t mind traversing the array in reverse order, you can remove an extra condition from the  loop and write it as simply the following:  var count = myarray.length; for  var x=count; x--;  {      . . . }  These differences are small when dealing with a modest number of iterations but can reduce time  signifi cantly for large numbers of iterations. Incidentally, if you wonder whether for is faster than  while or do, the answer is that it doesn’t actually matter.   In the previous example, it was fairly obvious that myarray.length would cause the length of the  array to be calculated. But sometimes it’s not so obvious, and, in general, you should be wary of any  loop conditions — they may not behave quite as you expect.   A prime example is if you want to act on all the elements of a particular type in the document. Your  loop might look something like this:  for  var x=0; x < document.getElementsByTagName "span" .length; x++  { . . . }  This also causes the number of span elements in the document to be recalculated for each iteration.  Surprisingly, the following code is also affected:  for  var varx=0, elements = document.getElementsByTagName "spans" ; x <       elements.length; x++  { . . . }  Again, the solution is to calculate the length outside of the loop.  A commonly used optimization technique by C C++ compilers is function inlining, where the  body of a function is inlined directly at the point where the function would have been called.  Although this increases the size of the code, it also eliminates the overhead involved in calling  the function  passing arguments to the function, jumping to execution of another part of the  program, and so on .  Inlining is most useful for functions called inside loops, especially if the loop is iterated through  many times. Knowing that calls to functions carry some overhead, you can perform inlining your- self where it is appropriate. Consider the following example, which converts between the Celsius  and Fahrenheit temperature scales:  for  x=0; x <1000; x++  {     var Fahrenheit = convertCF x ;        now do something with Fahrenheit } function convertCF x  {     return x*1.8+32; }  c06.indd   123 c06.indd   123  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   124  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   Admittedly, this a rather trivial example, but it illustrates the logic used in many scripts. To cut the  overhead of calling convertCF, you can rewrite the loop like so:  for  x=0; x <1000; x++  {     var Fahrenheit = x*1.8+32;        now do something with Fahrenheit }  In the real world, candidates for inlining aren’t always this clear-cut. If the convertCF function  were less trivial and were used in other places in the code, maintainability would suffer — after all,  the whole point of functions is to reduce code duplication. Still, when it comes to loops, inlining can  be a very attractive option.  Variable Scope  JavaScript uses the concept of local and global variables. Local variables exist only inside the   function in which they are defi ned; global variables are accessible from anywhere. Although local  variables are generally preferred because of their limited scope  which limits the chances of acciden- tally clobbering another variable with the same name , they need a little more thought to deploy,  and many web developers lazily use global variables. Consider the following example:  var x = 1; function foo   {      var y = 2;      alert  x ;    x has global scope, so this displays "1"      alert y ;    displays "2" }  Using global variables inside functions comes at a cost, though. JavaScript uses lexical scoping. At  the top is the global scope, and beneath that are any variables defi ned in top-level functions. If any  of these functions contain functions of their own, then variables in these nested functions are stored  in a second level of scope, and so on. Consider the following code:  var a = 1; function bar   {      var b = 2;      function baz   {            var c = 3;      } }  Here you have three levels of scope. What happens if, inside function baz, you decide to use the  global variable a? To determine the value for a, JavaScript must climb up the chain until it fi nds  a. So, fi rst it checks the local scope, then it looks in its parent chain, and then fi nally it checks the  global scope and fi nds a. Backtracking through the scope chain incurs a slight cost, which can be  eliminated  or at least reduced  by prudent use of local variables. Aside from that, local variables are  generally a cleaner way to code.  c06.indd   124 c06.indd   124  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   Getting the Most from JavaScript  ❘  125  One way to get around the use of globals inside of a function is to pass the variables that you need  as function parameters:  var x = 1; function foo z  {      alert z ;    local variable, with value of 1      } foo x ;  Or if you must access a global multiple times inside the function, copy it to a local variable fi rst. The  following example causes the global x to be looked up twice:  The following example results in only one global lookup of x:  var x = 1; function foo   {      var y,z;      y = x * 2;      z = x * 3; } foo  ;  var x = 1; function foo   {      var y,z;      var tmp = x;      y = tmp * 2;      z = tmp * 3; } foo  ;  Of course, the downside here is an increase in memory usage, since the data is being stored twice:  once globally, and once in the local scope. Unless the variable is very large, this is usually an accept- able trade-off.  eval    eval   suffers from a bad reputation in JavaScript for a number of reasons. It can be slow   although this situation is changing ; it can introduce security issues; and it has a tendency to be  wildly misused. There are situations in which eval   is the right choice, but care must be taken,  and too often there are better ways to do things. That’s not to say you should never use eval  . Just  think carefully beforehand.  The reason for the poor performance of eval   is that browsers typically did not cache the  compiled code. So, every time the eval   was executed, the browser would be forced to recompile  the code. The situation has changed in the last few years, though, and most browsers now actually  do cache the code, assuming that it is static. If the contents of the eval   statement are dynamic,  there is no opportunity for caching.  c06.indd   125 c06.indd   125  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   126  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   Regular Expressions  Regular expressions  regexes  are an important part of most high-level programming languages.  JavaScript is no different, and the tips presented here are mostly equally valid for other languages, too.  NOTE   Regular expressions are found in most high-level languages  Perl,  Python, PHP, Ruby, and so on  and many UNIX tools  such as grep, sed, and  awk . They also provide advanced pattern matching for strings. The power of  regular expressions  or regexes, as they are often known  goes well beyond  standard string searching, offering support for wildcards, character classes   for example, any lowercase letter , and back-tracking. For many people, regular  expressions are mysterious and daunting, but it’s well worth learning at least the  basics — they are incredibly useful and powerful when used correctly.  However, think before you use a regex. Is it actually needed? If you simply want to test whether one  string is contained in another, or occurs at the beginning or end of the string, use one of JavaScript’s  string functions, which will be a lot faster.   Generally speaking, the longer the string that you match against, the more JavaScript has to do  when applying the regex. So, keep the target string as short as possible  trim it fi rst, if possible , and  try to use ^ or $ to anchor the pattern being matched — that enables the regex parser to quickly  eliminate many impossible matches.  Modiﬁ ers Regex modifi ers are used to alter the meaning of the pattern being matched. In JavaScript, the two  most common modifi ers are i  match case insensitive  and g  global, don’t stop after the fi rst match  found . If you don’t need these modifi ers, don’t use them. If you do think you need them, consider if  it is possible to rewrite the regex with them, because, although they are not a serious problem, they  do cause extra work for JavaScript.  Reusing Expressions The following example shows one of the most common ways of using regexes in JavaScript:  for  var x = 0; x < array.length; x++  {     var matches array[x].match  patterntomatch       if  matches.length > 0  {            we've got a match     } }  Here, the pattern is passed directly to the match method, which returns true if there is a match.  The problem here is that JavaScript must internally parse and compile the regex, and this happens  for each iteration of the loop. In these situations, using the RegExp construct is a better option,  because it allows you to build the pattern once, outside of the loop, and then reuse it.  c06.indd   126 c06.indd   126  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   Getting the Most from JavaScript  ❘  127  var myregex =  patterntomatch  for  var x = 0; x < array.length; x++  {     if  myregex.test ...  array[x]  {            we've got a match     } }  This time, the regex is compiled by JavaScript and stored in the myregex object. You can then call  the test   method  or exec   if you want to return the string matched  on the object without  incurring the performance hit of having to recompile the regex. This change can result in a substan- tial speed increase, but note that if you are not planning to reuse a regex, it’s cheaper simply to pass  the pattern directly, rather than creating a RegExp object.  Loading JavaScript  Let’s return to the examination of how JavaScript interacts with the browser. During the initial page  loading, browsers usually download resources in parallel. With JavaScript, the situation is a little  different. If the browser encounters a link to an external JavaScript fi le, it begins to download it in  the usual way but blocks any other downloads from starting until the JavaScript is retrieved, parsed,  and executed.   An example should help to clarify this. Consider the following code:          Figure 6-1 shows the waterfall view when this page  loads in IE 8.  The browser fi rst encounters the link to  paypalcards.jpg and begins to retrieve this.  Next comes the external JavaScript, and because  you haven’t reached the maximum number of   parallel requests, this begins to download, too. Notice, however, that the second image does not  begin to download until test.js has been fully retrieved.  FIGURE 6-1  One reason for this blocking behavior is to guard against race conditions when downloading   multiple JavaScript fi les because you have no guarantee of the order in which they would fi nish  downloading and be executed. A script sourced further down in the HTML document could easily  be executed before an earlier script, even if there were a dependency between them. Serialization of  script execution is essential for avoiding nasty surprises.   Other resources are blocking from download in parallel with scripts for similar reasons. The script  may modify the DOM, which may cause unpredictable behavior if other resources have already  been downloaded.  This blocking behavior is one of the reasons why it is suggested to load any scripts at the end of the  page.  Another reason might be that many scripts simply don’t need to be loaded until the end.  By  loading visual elements fi rst, you create a site that seems faster.  c06.indd   127 c06.indd   127  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   128  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   Let’s rewrite the test page a little to see what happens:          Figure 6-2 shows the waterfall view.  With the JavaScript pushed to the end, there’s an  increase in the amount of parallelization, and the  overall loading time of the page is reduced.  FIGURE 6-2  This works great if there is only one external script to load, and if you can happily place it at the end  of the document. But what happens if you must source several external scripts? You can’t execute  them in parallel  for reasons already given , but there’s no reason why you shouldn’t download them  in parallel.   Nonblocking of JavaScript Downloads  There are a few methods to create the nonblocking of the download of JavaScript. Let’s take a  closer look.  defer Attribute  The defer attribute is an IE extension that has found its way into Firefox  starting with v3.5 ,  Safari  v5 , and Google Chrome  v7 . The syntax is as follows:      In supporting browsers, parsing this causes the script to be retrieved immediately, in a nonblocking  fashion, but it will not be executed until the page has fi nished loading. Order is preserved, so scripts  appearing earlier in the document will be executed fi rst.  The drawback with this method is a lack of browser support. For a long time, it was an IE-only  extension, and it has been only recently that other browsers have started to support it.   async  In HTML 5, you can use the async attribute to ask the browser to download the script without  blocking other downloads:      This time, the script will be executed as soon as it has downloaded. So, when multiple scripts are  used on the page, the order of execution cannot be predicted.  c06.indd   128 c06.indd   128  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   Getting the Most from JavaScript  ❘  129  iframes  Another method is to load the script inside an iframe like so:      Here, loader.html is a simple HTML document containing the appropriate   tag. This  method results in the script downloading and executing immediately.  There are two main reasons why this method isn’t favored:   ➤ iframes are relatively expensive to load — many times slower than other DOM elements —   although for a single iframe, this probably isn’t signifi cant.   ➤ For JavaScript loaded in an iframe to access the parent page DOM, changes must be made   to the code.  Dynamically Writing Script Tags  Probably the most popular method to invoke the nonblocking of the download of JavaScript is to  dynamically write the script tag with JavaScript. This method has traditionally been the best   supported  although note the earlier comments about the increase in support for defer , and does  not have the performance penalty associated with the iframe method.  var newjs = document.createElement 'script' ; newjs.src = 'test.js'; var head = document.getElementsByTagName 'head' [0]; head.appendChild newjs ;  When the external script is included in this way, it is downloaded without blocking, and executes  immediately after the download has fi nished. Despite its popularity, this method has the drawback  that execution order is not guaranteed. So, again, you may end up with scripts executed in the  “wrong” order.  User Feedback  When a web page is busy loading, the user typically gets some form of feedback — often an ani- mated turning wheel near the top and information in the status bar  assuming it has not been hid- den . Usability research has shown that these are important parts of the user experience. Users like  to feel that a page has fi nished loading before they start to interact with it.  How do the nonblocking JavaScript methods affect this behavior? Not surprisingly, the answer isn’t  consistent from browser to browser, but, in general, all the methods cause loading feedback, with  the exception of Ajax techniques.  However, this still causes feedback in Chrome and Safari.  This  can be a good thing or a bad thing.   NOTE   You’ll learn more about Ajax techniques in the “Ajax” section later in  this chapter.  c06.indd   129 c06.indd   129  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   130  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   With code that forms an essential part of the page, displaying loading feedback discourages users  from interacting until the code has fully loaded. On the other hand, if the code is not essential, there  is no harm in the user browsing the site before it has fi nished loading. Showing a busy indicator   simply makes the site look sluggish.  Picking the Right Method  At the moment, dynamically inserting the script tag into the DOM is probably the best method;  although the defer attribute is becoming increasingly well supported and may be the way to go in  the future. If you want to avoid browser feedback, use one of the Ajax methods discussed in the  “Ajax” section of this chapter.  Some newer browsers do actually support nonblocking JavaScript by default, and, in the not too  distance future, the techniques just described will hopefully become increasingly unnecessary. For  example, IE8 onward downloads multiple scripts in parallel  and will execute them in the correct  order , as does Firefox 3.5 onward. With the two market leaders having adopted this, it’s likely that  other vendors will eventually follow suit.  Merging, Splitting, and Inlining  Web designers are often particular about their code, and enjoy nothing more than separating   different JavaScript functionality into different fi les. Thus, inside the   of a document, it’s  common to see half a dozen or more   tags loading external fi les, some with only a small  amount of code in them.  Merging  There’s no question that storing scripts separately is the best way to maintain a big project. But for a  production website, it has an adverse effect on performance. For each request, there’s the additional  latency to send the request to the server and wait for a response. So, merging everything into one fi le   then minifying it, of course  is often the way forward. If necessary, you can keep the scripts sepa- rate in your source tree and write a simple shell script to “publish” them for the live site.   Figure 6-3 shows the waterfall for a page with fi ve  small scripts in the document head.  Each script is 1,447 bytes, so the time spent down- loading the scripts is tiny and is not visible in this  waterfall. Instead, the browser spends most of its  time waiting for the web server to respond.  Figure 6-4 shows a waterfall after merging the fi ve  scripts into a single fi le  combined.js . As you can  see, you save about 0.4 second by merging.  FIGURE 6-3  FIGURE 6-4  In the previous section, you learned that recent  browsers now download JavaScript in parallel. The example shown in Figure 6-4 was for IE 7.  Figure 6-5 shows that the results are quite different for IE 8.   c06.indd   130 c06.indd   130  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   Getting the Most from JavaScript  ❘  131  FIGURE 6-5  IE 8 can download up to four resources in parallel  including JavaScript , so, although the waterfall  diagram shows a lot of time being spent creating the connection and waiting on the web server, the  overall page loading time isn’t dramatically different from when the fi ve scripts were merged together.  This test shows a slight improvement — although such small fl uctuations should be taken with a pinch  of salt when benchmarking against a live server over an unreliable medium  such as the Internet .  The relevance of this test has also suffered from  short-sightedness. It fails to consider how the over- all page loading time is affected. If you add four  images to the page, the waterfall view  again with  IE8  looks as shown in Figure 6-6.  As before, four JavaScript resources are loaded in  parallel. Once the JavaScript has been loaded and  executed, the image resources are then fetched over  the already-open connections.  FIGURE 6-6  In Figure 6-7, the combined JavaScript fi le is used. Resource 3 is fetched over the existing   connection, but resources 4 and 5 each require a new connection to be opened.  FIGURE 6-7  This time, the overall page loading time is approximately one-half a second lower, and there are a  few interesting things happening here.   In both waterfalls, JavaScript fi nishes loading at roughly the same time. But, in Figure 6-6, the  four parallel connections have already been established at this point, and the image requests do not   suffer the penalty of waiting for a connection to be established. In Figure 6-7 two of the images are  retrieved over new connections, increasing the request latency.   c06.indd   131 c06.indd   131  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   132  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   NOTE   Incidentally, you may have noticed a slight gap in some of the waterfall  fi gures, between the JavaScript download fi nishing and the next request starting.  Figure 6-6 shows a good example of this, at approximately the 0.7 seconds mark.  The reason is, after downloading the script, the browser must next execute it. It  does this before it issues any more requests. Usually, the delay is minimal, but  large gaps here can indicate ineffi cient JavaScript — or just lots of it.   To some extent, though, this penalty is offset by better utilization of bandwidth. In the waterfall  shown in Figure 6-6, there is a period  from approximately 0.7 to 0.9 seconds  when the browser is  not downloading anything, but simply waiting for the web server to respond. After the four images  begin to download, they do so in parallel, resulting in bandwidth being split across them. In the  waterfall shown in Figure 6-7, image1.gif begins downloading fi rst, and benefi ts from having the  whole bandwidth  well near enough — packets are still fl owing as the browser sets up the other two  connections  to itself.  In browsers that support parallel downloading of JavaScript, keeping scripts separate actually  improves loading times in many cases. But you must keep in mind that not all browsers do this, and  the overall gain is dependent on resources in the rest of the page.   The results also depend on the degree of parallelization offered by the browser. As you’ve already  seen, older browsers generally supported two requests in parallel, whereas newer browsers usually  perform four, six, or eight. With IE 8, this value is six, so there’s nothing to be gained on IE 8 from  having more than six external scripts  six external scripts next to each other in the document, any- way . If the six scripts were scattered through the page, the situation would be different. So, merging  your JavaScript into a maximum of two or four scripts is probably the best trade-off for perfor- mance versus cross-browser compatibility.  One thing not yet touched upon is how blocking affects all this. In the waterfall images so far,   nothing else happened until the JavaScript had been downloaded. Clearly, IE 8 will download other  JavaScript fi les in parallel, but not other resources.   This is more noticeable in the tests using the com- bined JavaScript fi le.  Let’s try again in IE8 using  the defer attribute.  Figure 6-8 shows the defer attribute being used  to load the combined JavaScript fi le. No block- ing occurs, and three of the images are requested  immediately.  In Figure 6-9, the defer attribute is used on each  of the four JavaScript resources. This leads to an  increase in the amount of parallelization, but the  effect is still an increase in loading time. The com- bined version is approximately 1 second faster to  complete.   FIGURE 6-8  FIGURE 6-9  c06.indd   132 c06.indd   132  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   Getting the Most from JavaScript  ❘  133  So, sometimes it pays to merge your JavaScript into a single fi le, and sometimes it doesn’t. Too much  depends on the nature of your code and other resources on the page. There is no hard-and-fast rule  on whether to merge the JavaScript on your site, but at least you now know about the tools for you  to make your own decision.  Splitting  Some websites use a set of one or more external JavaScript fi les that need to be loaded on every  page, but for many sites, the script needed varies from page to page. For example, you might have  some form-checking code that needs to be loaded only on a contact page.   If you opt to merge all the JavaScript into a single fi le, you have a dilemma. If you include the code  that is specifi c to certain pages, you increase the size of your global, combined fi le. If you leave it  out, you increase the number of resources to be downloaded. So, where do you draw the line? If one  of your JavaScript libraries is used on half the pages on your site, should you merge it into the global  script? What if the script is used only on a few pages, but is only a few hundred bytes?   One solution seen in many CMSs  where the JavaScript and CSS used tend to be large and can vary  greatly depending on admin settings  is to pass a list of required fi les to a dynamic script that builds  the JavaScript or CSS on-the-fl y. A call to such a script might look like this:  <script type="text javascript"     src=" rollup.php?files=main.js,forms.js,ajax.js,toolbar.js">    The back-end PHP script fetches these four fi les, merges them together, and spits out the result  with  an appropriate content-type header .  The advantage here is that you can load only the code you need for this particular page, and you  have only one browser request. The downsides are that it makes caching diffi cult, increases latency   running some PHP code and opening multiple fi les is always going to be slower than serving a sin- gle static fi le , and puts extra work on the server,  Usually you’d want to serve static resources from  something like Nginx without evoking PHP.  So, although this is sort of okay for people who don’t  want to get their hands dirty, for websites where performance ranks high, it’s not good enough.  Although merging is often the right thing to do, generally it also makes sense to keep code separate  if it is used only on a few pages  to avoid the overhead of loading where it is not needed . In some  cases, that can even mean that splitting an existing script is the right thing to do.  In the case of sites with a members area, one possible way of bundling is to group your code into  two fi les: one for logged-in users and one for guests. Typically, guests wouldn’t have access to what- you-see-is-what-you-get  WYSIWYG   editors for making posts, instant messaging chat widgets, and  so on. Here’s a simple example of how such logic might work:    <?php if  $_SESSION['userid'] > 0  {      print ' ';     }    c06.indd   133 c06.indd   133  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   134  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   guest.js is loaded no matter what. But if the user is logged in  in this example, the session variable  userid holds a numeric ID if the user is logged in , a second resource, member.js, is also loaded.  Usually, the goal is to minimize loading times as much as possible for the fi rst page that visitors hit.  Web users can be impatient, and you don’t want slow loading times to scare them away. If you have  a page that receives a clear majority of incoming traffi c  such as the homepage , it can make sense to  keep the scripting on this to a bare minimum — don’t load code used on the majority of the rest of  the site because visitors may not even get that far.  Inlining  Usually, you store JavaScript in external fi les because it is cacheable and reduces overall page loading  times;  although web developers do it because it increases maintainability and ease of development.  However, for small fi les, the cost to fetch an additional resource outweighs the decrease in the size  of your HTML document. If you load other scripts, you can simply append a small script to one of  these. Failing that, putting your JavaScript inline  directly inside the HTML document  can be the  best option.  It’s diffi cult to say at which exact point this becomes the more attractive option, but it’s roughly at  the 1 KB or 2 KB upward mark that issuing an additional request for external code becomes faster  overall than inlining.  Web Workers  The last few years have seen great advances in the performance of many JavaScript engines for many  browsers, but they are still held back by JavaScript’s inherently single-threaded nature. In many  situations, this isn’t a problem. Typically, JavaScript is used to execute short blocks of code based  on user interaction — for example, the user submits a form, and some fi eld checking takes place. As  such, responsiveness tends not to be too sluggish.  Things are different, though, if you must execute particularly intensive or long-running code   as has become increasingly common with today’s JavaScript-rich sites, which often behave almost  like desktop applications . Because there is only one thread, nothing else can execute until the long-  running block of code has fi nished.   For example, consider a script for drawing the Mandelbrot set. After the user has clicked a button  to start the script running, all other scripts on the page will be unresponsive until it has fi nished —  that includes unrelated scripting such as form checking or JavaScript navigation menus. Of course,  plotting the Mandelbrot set is something of an extreme example, but there are plenty of situations in  which this single-threaded behavior causes the interface to appear slightly sluggish.  One option is to use timers  specifi cally, the setTimeout   function  to periodically pause execution  of a long-running block of code, allowing other code to be handled. This gives the impression of  multi-tasking, but is rather hacky, and still not as smooth as you would wish.  The solution comes in the form of web workers — background threads running separate scripts, and  communicating with the parent thread via messages. All the major browsers now support web work- ers, and Table 6-2 shows when support was introduced.  c06.indd   134 c06.indd   134  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   Getting the Most from JavaScript  ❘  135  TABLE 6-2:  Introduction of Web Workers  BROWSER  WEB WORKERS INTRODUCED  Firefox  Version 3.5  IE  Version 10.0  Opera  Version 10.6  Chrome  Version 4.0  Safari  Version 4.0  Because web workers run in their own thread, there is some work to do in initializing the thread  and communicating with the parent. Web workers are only intended for heavy, long-running scripts   such as the Mandelbrot example . For anything smaller, the overhead of initializing the worker  thread cancels out any performance gains.  The fi rst step is to create a new worker thread, passing it the name of the script to load:  var worker = new Worker 'code.js' ;  A new worker thread is created, and the code is downloaded in this thread. But execution does not  start until specifi cally instructed, as shown here:  worker.postMessage  ;  As well as starting the worker code running, postMessage is also used for communicating with the  worker:  worker.postMessage "hello" ;  The worker can capture these messages by setting up an event listener:  self.addEventListener 'message',      function e  {            e.data contains the string "hello"     } , false ;  Data can also be passed as JavaScript Object Notation  JSON  and is automatically parsed by  the receiver. In the following example, the message object is automatically serialized to JSON  by the postMessage method:     in main script worker.postMessage {'action': 'execute', 'order': '66'} ;     in worker script self.addEventListener 'message',   c06.indd   135 c06.indd   135  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   136  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX       function e  {         if  e.data.order == 66  {             ...         } , false ;  Usually, you want to communicate both ways, and catching messages sent from the worker to the  parent works in a similar fashion via an event handler — this time, a property of the worker object,  as shown here:  worker. addEventListener 'message',   function e  {        again, e.data holds the received message } , false ;  If you’ve written threaded applications before, you’ll be aware of how messy things can get. For this  reason, web worker threads have limited access to the DOM  because they could potentially write to  the DOM at the same time as other threads are reading or writing . This is the main reason why an  elaborate messaging system is used between threads and parents.   In addition to restrictions on accessing the DOM, web workers have no access to the window,  parent,  or document objects. They can, however, use XMLHttpRequest, access the navigator and location  objects, and load external JavaScript fi les. Worker threads also have the capability to spawn subwork- ers, but situations in which these are needed are rare. Remember that there is an overhead associated  with spawning a new worker.  AJAX  In recent years, Ajax has become a buzzword and is one of the driving forces behind the annoyingly  titled Web 2.0. Yet, Ajax is quite a loose term and refers to technologies that have been around for  some time — JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and XML JSON.  It’s misleading to think of Ajax performance as a separate concern because it is just a question of  performance in these areas. There are no magic tricks specifi cally for Ajax. Rather, benefi ts come  from optimized JavaScript, careful use of the DOM, and a responsive back-end web server.  XMLHttpRequest  At the heart of Ajax is the XMLHttpRequest  XHR  function used in JavaScript to load a resource  in the background. This function allows for both synchronous and asynchronous calls. The latter   asynchronous calls  are preferable because they do not cause the calling script to block. Instead, you  write an event listener to trigger when the request has completed.  XHR also offers the choice of GET or POST requests. Surprisingly, it turns out that, even when POSTing  tiny amounts of data, the request is split into two packets — the fi rst containing the HTTP header  and the second containing the POST data. All the major browsers  with the exception of Firefox   behave like this. With GET, the data is contained in a single packet. So, if all other things are equal,  GET is the preferred method.  c06.indd   136 c06.indd   136  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   Ajax  ❘  137  All other things aren’t always equal, though. Caching and privacy are the other major factors, and  there are sometimes cases where POST is preferred because the response will not be cached.  Using Ajax for Nonblocking of JavaScript  You can also use Ajax as a means to invoke the nonblocking of the download of JavaScript. You can  fetch the script via XHR and then execute it by passing the response through eval  . Some libraries  such as Prototype even have an option to automatically use eval   on the response.  Alternatively, you could use XHR to fetch the script, and then insert it into the DOM inside a    tag.  These methods don’t offer any advantages over the other techniques examined earlier in this chapter.  They cause the script to be downloaded without blocking; it executes immediately, and there is no  guarantee of the order of execution. In addition, with this being Ajax, you can fetch scripts hosted  only on the same domain name. These methods also mean loading an Ajax library; although you can  write a simple cross-browser XHR library in 20 or 30 lines of code.  Server Responsiveness  The responsiveness of the web server is crucial to create an Ajax application that does not feel slug- gish — even more so than with standard HTTP requests — and you want to minimize latency as  much as possible. Using a lightweight server such as Nginx usually helps, and you should keep the  use of back-end scripting and database lookups to a minimum. Serving cached contents where pos- sible is an even better idea.  If you do use preforked Apache, keeping a high number of idle servers free cuts out the possible  overhead of spawning a new child process to handle incoming XHR requests. Unfortunately, there  may also be situations in which Apache is up to its MaxClients limit and is queuing requests.  Although this may add “only” a second or two to the response time, this can be noticeable on Ajax- driven sites.   NOTE   The Apache web server  which you will learn about in much more  detail in Chapter 7, “Working with Web Servers”  supports several modes of  process management, of which prefork is the most common. In this mode, each  request is handled by a separate child process. This contrasts with the worker  module, which is built around threading. To avoid overloading the server,  Apache is  confi gured to handle a maximum number of requests simultaneously   MaxClients . If this limit is reached, requests are queued up, leading to a delay  in the request being served.  Apache’s mod_qos can be used to shape traffi c, giving priority to requests on a particular  directory.  In this way, you could ensure that all requests for Ajax scripts go to the top of the queue, should  there be a backlog. In practice though, connection queuing indicates a server straining to cope, and  you should be looking at scaling up or out, rather than taping up the cracks.  c06.indd   137 c06.indd   137  05 11 12   4:41 PM 05 11 12   4:41 PM   138  ❘  CHAPTER 6  JAVASCRIPT, THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, AND AJAX   Using Preemptive Loading  Ajax can take advantage of preemptive loading. With Ajax, you have the capability to load scripts in  a manner that  with the exception of Safari and Chrome  will not generate any loading feedback in  the browser. Thus, one option is to load what you need for the landing page, wait until the page has  rendered, and send an Ajax request for the remaining JavaScript. Although you don’t need it yet, it  will be cached in the browser in anticipation.  Ajax Frameworks  Many developers use a framework such as Prototype or JQuery to develop Ajax websites. These  libraries have a lot of features that can make Ajax a breeze, but they can also be rather heavy. If all  you need is XHR, a full-blown framework isn’t necessary. Instead, a lightweight solution is microajax   http:  code.google.com p microajax  , which provides a cross-browser XHR wrapper in 841  bytes.  SUMMARY  Developers of the major browsers have made signifi cant improvements to their JavaScript engines,  and manipulation of the DOM tends to be the most expensive part of JavaScript-rich sites. Knowing  this, you can minimize your use of the DOM and employ tricks such as storing references in vari- ables to lessen this.  Browsers have historically loaded JavaScript in a blocking manner, which can make pages appear  slow to load. This is gradually changing, but there are also a number of tricks to get around this.  You must also think carefully about how JavaScript is arranged. Should it be inline, external, or a  combination of the two? A lot depends on what it is used for, and how users access the site.  Ajax is popular, and although most of this chapter’s discussion on JavaScript and the DOM applies  here, there are a number of small tips specifi cally for Ajax development.  So far, you have learned about a variety of front-end aspects of website performance — from  JavaScript and CSS to minifi cation and compression. The second part of this book is devoted to the  back end — the applications and code that run behind the scenes to make the web work. You’ll be  learning how to tune the most commonly used tools  PHP, MySQL, Apache, and Nginx  for optimal  performance, discovering what all the hype over NoSQL is about, and seeing how load balancing  and other multi-server setups work.

Yet, Apache is not perfect, and as web growth has accelerated  and as Ajax has  changed the nature of some of this traffi c , the need to serve huge numbers of requests has  given birth to several lightweight web servers specifi cally designed with performance in mind.   This chapter examines performance considerations for Apache, before taking a look at the  most prominent of the competitors that have emerged in the last decade. This chapter also   discusses the challenges that can arise when moving away from Apache, and takes a brief look  at caching, front-end proxies, and load-balanced server pools.  APACHE  The Apache HTTP Server is such an important part of the Internet’s history  and the history  of Linux, for that matter, too, since Apache + Linux + x86 quickly became a viable alternative  to commercial web servers running on UNIX mainframes in the 1990s . Because of that, this  discussion assumes that you have at least a basic knowledge of Apache management and con- fi guration, even if you have never compiled it from source  because so many operating systems  offer precompiled Apache binaries in their package systems .  c07.indd   141 c07.indd   141  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   142  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Numerous aspects of Apache have the potential to affect performance, and, in this section, you’ll  learn how modules impact memory usage, the differences between the various Multi-Process Models   MPMs , how to choose an optimal level of concurrency, the various caching modules available, and  much more.  Working with Modules  Part of the reason for Apache’s popularity is its modular system, enabling third-party developers  to extend the core functionality. The number and variety of modules are a testament to Apache’s  success. There are modules that provide both forward and reverse proxying, enhanced security, all  manners of alternative authentication systems, and even passive operating system fi ngerprinting.   But these modules come at a price. Each additional module loaded increases the memory footprint  of Apache, and sometimes increases the CPU overhead when handling a request. Thus, one of the  fi rst steps in tuning Apache should be to remove any unnecessary modules from the confi guration  fi les.  This isn’t quite as easy a task as it might seem. A typical default Apache installation can have dozens  of modules enabled, and some are useful enough to be considered almost essential  for example, the  handling of MIME types with mod_mime . Before blindly removing modules, it’s worth checking  precisely what they do.   You can fi nd a good overview in the Apache 2.2 docs at http:  httpd.apache.org docs 2.2  mod . In addition, Linux distribution vendors confi gure their Apache packages in slightly differ- ent ways. On Red Hat-derived distributions  such as CentOS or Fedora , LoadModule statements  are typically contained in the main httpd.conf fi le  under  etc httpd conf  , whereas Debian- derived systems use a separate fi le for each module, contained under  etc apache2  mods-available. In most situations, it’s enough to comment out the LoadModule directive. Any  directives specifi c to the module are typically wrapped in   blocks to prevent them from  being executed if the module has not been loaded.  Of course, this assumes that Apache has been compiled with support for dynamically loadable  modules. Most distribution vendors do this, but if you compile Apache from a source, you have the  choice.   The alternative is to compile the modules that you need directly into Apache and disable dynamic  shared object  DSO  support. Removing DSO support lowers Apache’s footprint a little  and can  be useful for security, too, because it prevents an attacker inserting malicious modules . But it can  also be greatly inconvenient — if you ever want to add or remove a module, you need to recompile  Apache. For this reason, removing DSO support should be left until the list of modules that are  required has been decided and tested.  Multi-Process Modules  MPMs   Apache 2 introduced the concept of Multi-Process Modules  MPMs , which control how Apache  handles concurrent requests. Only one MPM can be loaded at a time.  A recompile is required to  change MPMs.  For Linux, there are two MPMs to choose from  special MPMs that are specifi c to  the operating system exist for OS2, Netware, and Windows : prefork and worker. Prefork is gener- ally the default and is the most stable, whereas worker is more experimental but promises better  performance.  c07.indd   142 c07.indd   142  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Apache  ❘  143  Prefork MPM  The prefork MPM is a nonthreaded model in which multiple child processes each run as a single  thread, and each child handles a single connection at a time. The following confi guration snippet  shows the available prefork options:  StartServers            10    MinSpareServers         5     MaxSpareServers         10    ServerLimit             100   MaxClients              100   MaxRequestsPerChild     1000   StartServers is the initial number of child processes to start, whereas MinSpareServers and  MaxSpareServers control the minimum and maximum number of spare processes to keep in the  pool. MaxClients controls the maximum number of child processes that may run at any one  time — and, therefore, the maximum number of clients that Apache can serve concurrently — but  this is also governed by ServerLimit.   Why have two directives that appear to do the same thing? Changes to the value for MaxClients  can be affected by sending Apache a SIGHUP  that is, a reload , whereas any change to ServerLimit  requires a full stop start of Apache. This is because ServerLimit also helps Apache to judge the  amount of shared memory to allocate when starting up. Therefore, ServerLimit should always  be equal to  or higher than  MaxClients. In practice, it’s useful to keep it slightly higher, allowing  MaxClients to be raised slightly without a full restart.  Finally, MaxRequestsPerChild governs how many requests a single child process can handle in its  lifetime. The reason this is not unlimited  although you can set this value to zero for unlimited if  you want  is that memory leaks can  and do  occur. By setting a reasonably high value, you prevent  memory leaks from accumulating too much while lessening the overhead involved in spawning new  children too often.  This, then, is what happens when a preforking Apache server receives a request. The parent process  receives the request and attempts to assign it to a child. Parent and child communicate with each  other through a scoreboard, which is implemented in shared memory.  This is the default under  Linux, anyway.  If a spare child exists in the pool, it handles the request. If no spare child processes  exist  and MaxClients has not been reached , a new child is spawned to handle the process. If the  maximum number of child processes is already running, the request is queued until a child becomes  available.   After the request has been served, a number of things may happen. If MaxRequestsPerChild has  been reached, or there are already MaxSpareServers in the pool, the child is destroyed. Otherwise,  the child is kept alive so that it may serve future requests.  The reason to maintain a pool of spare servers is that the act to spawn a new child is somewhat  CPU-intensive and adds to the latency of responses. By keeping a handful of children spare, you  reduce the likelihood that a new process needs to be spawned — unless, of course, a sudden fl ood of  requests requires more than MaxSpareServers number of processes.   The downside to having a large number of spare children in the pool is that they all add to memory  usage — and memory is a precious resource. The overhead from spawning a new child is not so   c07.indd   143 c07.indd   143  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   144  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  great that it should be avoided at all costs, and it is generally not worth setting the maximum and  minimum number of servers high in the hope that Apache will rarely need to spawn extra children.  The memory could be put to better use.   Still, if the machine runs as a dedicated web server, or request latency is of high importance  such as  in an AJAX application , it’s generally a good idea to raise these two values signifi cantly. Remember,  too, that with modern web browsers requesting up to eight resources in parallel from the same host,  a single client could take up to eight child processes.   Worker MPM  The worker MPM uses a multithreaded model in which each child process runs many threads, with  each thread handling a single request. This makes the worker MPM ideally suited for multiprocessor  machines, and it offers the promise of being faster, having a lower memory footprint, and scaling  better than the prefork MPM.  The confi guration options for a worker MPM are similar to those for prefork:      StartServers          2     MaxClients            150     MinSpareThreads       25     MaxSpareThreads       75     ThreadsPerChild       25     MaxRequestsPerChild   1000  Again, StartServers specifi es how many child processes to start when Apache is launched.  MaxClients controls the maximum number of concurrent requests, and MaxRequestsPerChild  governs how many requests a single child processes before terminating.   The worker MPM has three different settings, however. ThreadsPerChild sets the number of threads  that each child process will run, whereas MinSpareThreads and MaxSpareThreads control the num- ber of threads that are kept spare. These are analogous to the maximum and minimum spare servers  in the prefork MPM, only this time, these options deal with threads, not child processes.  This promise of a slimmer, more effi cient model may sound too good to be true. There is a signifi - cant downside to the worker MPM. All Apache modules must be thread-safe. For trivial modules,  this usually isn’t a problem. But for the likes of mod_php, this is a big problem. Not only must the   programming language  covered in more detail in Chapter 12, Optimizing PHP  be thread-safe, but  any libraries that it depends on must also be. In practice, this makes it extremely diffi cult to ensure  that PHP is thread-safe. Unless you are brave, PHP combined with a worker MPM is simply not a  viable option at the moment.  There’s also the question of just how effi cient the worker MPM is. Although benchmarking fi gures  are sometimes unreliable, they do tend to vary a lot for the worker MPM. Some users report a per- formance increase of a few hundred percent, others see little difference, whereas still some actually  see a drop in performance. This suggests that it is far from being a magic bullet, but it is suited to  particular workloads.   If thread safety is not a problem, you should try the worker MPM. Most likely, it can improve per- formance. But be aware that, in some situations, it might make things worse. For the remainder of  this chapter, let’s assume that the prefork MPM is used.  c07.indd   144 c07.indd   144  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Apache  ❘  145  Deciding on Concurrency  No matter which MPM you choose to use, you must decide on the maximum number of concurrent  clients that Apache should handle. If you decide to use too few, the hardware will be under-utilized.  If you decide to use too many, you risk sending the server into a downward spiral of swapping.  Setting MaxClients  It’s best to start with a conservative fi gure and gradually raise MaxClients after you are sure that  the system can handle it. Although there’s the temptation to set MaxClients as high as the server  can tolerate, this doesn’t usually lead to the best overall throughput. At this level of concurrency,  each request will doubtlessly take longer for Apache to process, so the overall throughput may well  remain the same  or lessen, because of increased context switching . Rather than aiming for the  highest possible concurrency, aim for the fastest overall handling of a client’s request.  You can attempt to calculate an approximate limit for MaxClients based on the memory usage of  a single child. This relies on the principle that MaxClients times memory per child should never  exceed the amount of RAM you have set aside for Apache. On a dedicated web server, this would  be a little less than the overall installed memory because some would be needed for the rest of the  operating system. On a dual-purpose Apache MySQL box, this might be approximately one-half the  available RAM.  When looking at the memory usage of multiple instances of the same application, the resident set  size  RSS  usage is the most appropriate because it excludes the footprint of shared libraries. Under  Linux and other fl avors of UNIX, you can see the RSS in the output of ps:   ps -ylC apache2 --sort:rss S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI   RSS    SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD S    33  1955   585  0  80   0  9048 18462 -      ?        00:00:00 apache2 S     0   585     1  0  80   0 16604 18347 -      ?        00:00:06 apache2 S    33  1863   585  1  80   0 24216 20075 -      ?        00:00:01 apache2 . . . S    33 32077   585  1  80   0 36356 21004 -      ?        00:00:08 apache2 S    33 26948   585  1  80   0 36504 21131 -      ?        00:00:37 apache2 R    33  1166   585  1  80   0 38832 23345 -      ?        00:00:02 apache2  So, the hungriest Apache process currently running uses approximately 38 MB. On a dedicated web  server with 6 GB of RAM, you could run approximately 150 of these processes, still leaving a few  hundred megabytes free for the rest of the operating system.   There are so many assumptions and over-simplifi cations here, however, that this fi gure must be  treated with a pinch of salt, and only used as a rough ballpark fi gure. For starters, not every child  will use 38 MB of memory — as the ps output showed  or would have shown had it not been trun- cated , most were using less. Conversely, because these fi gures show only a single point in time, it  might be that Apache children are regularly using more than 38 MB.  Secondly, it has been assumed that RAM is only bottleneck. It may well be that your server hits  CPU and I O bottlenecks before the 150-client limit is reached.   c07.indd   145 c07.indd   145  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   146  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Finally, memory usage in many operating systems can be rather complicated, and asking how much  memory an individual process “uses” is ambiguous. Still, it provides a rough fi gure from which  to start and helps to illustrate the importance of removing unneeded modules. A small change in  the memory footprint of a single child can become signifi cant when multiplied by a few hundred  children.  ListenBacklog  One thing not yet mentioned is what happens when MaxClients is reached. The answer is that  Apache queues requests up to a maximum defi ned by the ListenBacklog directive.  The default for  this option is 511; although it depends on the operating system.    In most web browsers, this results in a blank, white page with the progress bar stalled at zero,  with only the browser’s animated loading icon showing that something is still happening. When  the request reaches the front of the queue, it is passed to a child process and is handled as usual.  If the backlog queue becomes full, Apache returns a 503 status code, and the browser displays a  message along the lines of The Server Is Too Busy. It’s almost always fi ne to leave ListenBacklog  at its default value.  Improving Logging  A busy web server can generate a signifi cant number of log entries. Naturally, Linux buffers these  writes, but with disk I O being one of the most common bottlenecks, it makes sense to look closely  at logging. In addition, because it is common to use separate log fi les for each virtual host, Linux  may regularly seek not just one, but dozens of different fi les.  Apache offers two types of log fi les: access logs and error logs.   An error log contains error messages and has an associated logging level — one of the standard  eight logging levels used by syslog and others, including debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, and emerg. Thus, a log level of warn would log error messages of a warning level or higher   error, crit, alert, and emerg .  Some modules  in particular PHP  can be rather verbose in their error logging, and it pays to set the  log level to a reasonably high value — certainly debugging events are unlikely to be of any interest  on a production server. The default level is warn, but error is generally a better value for use on  production servers:  ErrorLog logs error_log  LogLevel error   An access log is a log of all requests sent to the server, and access logs pose more of a challenge. To  start with, they tend to be much bigger, and turning off logging is not an option for most sites. They  rely on statistics generated from the access logs to monitor access patterns, incoming links, search  engine search terms, and so on.   Log Formatting  The good news is that Apache is extremely fl exible when it comes to logging. Not only can you con- trol what is logged, but also where it is logged to, as shown here:  c07.indd   146 c07.indd   146  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Apache  ❘  147  LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\""       mylogformat CustomLog logs access_log mylogformat  In this example, you create your own log format named mylogformat and write it to logs access_ log. A complete list of available format strings is available at http:  httpd.apache.org docs  current mod mod_log_config.htmlformats. This example produces log entries like so:  1.2.3.4 - - [22 Nov 2012:11:49:01 +0000] "GET  favicon.ico HTTP 1.1" 200 3638       "-" "Mozilla 5.0  Windows NT 6.1; WOW64  AppleWebKit 535.2  KHTML,       like Gecko  Chrome 15.0.874.121 Safari 535.2"   One approach to keeping the size of the logs down is to be more selective about which fi elds you log.  For example, if you decide you can live without the browser’s user agent, you halve the size of each  log entry. The result should be more log entries that are buffered in memory before Linux needs to  write them out to disk. Similarly, you might decide you can live without the HTTP status returned   %s  and the number of bytes transferred  %b . The savings here are rather modest, though, and if  this data has any use for monitoring or statistics, just leave it in.  Conditional Logging  Another option is to attempt to reduce the number of log entries that each visitor generates. When  a user visits your website  especially if it’s with an empty cache , there will typically be a fl ood of  requests — for example, images, external CSS and JavaScript, favorite icon, and so on — with a log  entry for each request. In practice, though, you probably want to know the name of only the page  that the user requested.   You can fi lter out the noise using conditional logging and environmental variables  so ensure that  the SetEnvIf module is loaded , as shown here:  SetEnvIf Request_URI "\. PNGpnggifGIFjpgJPGcssCSSjsJSicoICO $""       ignorethese LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" mylogformat CustomLog logs access_log mylogformat env=!ignorethese  This example sets an env variable, ignorethese, if the request URI is for any of the fi le extensions  listed. If the env variable has been set, CustomLog ignores does not log the entry.  This should have a dramatic effect on the size of your log fi les. But remember that sometimes this  extra information does have its uses. For example, you can get an idea of how effective your  caching strategies are by looking at the number of clients who request a page, but not the  associated media.  Similarly, you can restrict logging based on a handful of other conditions — for example, ignore  requests from localhost, or on a resource in a particular directory.  Piping Logs  As well as writing logs to a fi le, Apache also supports the piping of log events to an external applica- tion. This can be an incredibly useful feature, which opens up several new possibilities.   c07.indd   147 c07.indd   147  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   148  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  For example, you could feed your logs directly to a stats-generation application, which, in turn,  would need to only write a summary of events to disk. Or you could send the events to a logging  daemon on a remote host, removing the need to write anything to the local disk. Of these two  ideas, the latter is the most practical because any local log parser application inevitably takes away  resources from Apache.   Rather than reinventing the wheel, it makes sense to use syslog syslog-ng for this because it  already supports remote logging over the network. For the ErrorLog directive, you can simply spec- ify syslog as the destination, optionally including the syslog facility, as shown here:  ErrorLog syslog:remoteapache  For the access log, you must pipe to the logger binary, which can be used for sending log events to  syslog:  CustomLog " usr bin logger -t 'apache 192.168.0.1'" -p remoteapache combined  Both of these examples assume that the remoteapache log facility has been appropriately defi ned in  syslog.conf.  Miscellaneous Performance Considerations  Let’s take a look at a somewhat random collection of performance tips for Apache, which don’t fi t  cleanly into any of the previous sections, and which don’t warrant detailed discussion.  Reducing DNS Lookups  Hostnames are generally easier to work with than IP addresses, and many administrators would  prefer that Apache’s access logs use hostnames rather than IP addresses. This option is controlled by  the  HostnameLookups directive, but unless you have a compelling reason to enable this, it is best left  turned off  the default . Not only does it increase network traffi c  because Apache queries the  nameserver , it also increases request latency.  If you need to resolve IP addresses to hostnames in the Apache logs, there are a couple of options.  You can run a caching, resolving nameserver on the local web server, eliminating network latency.  Or you can simply perform the lookups at a later time — for example, as part of the log rotation  script. Apache includes a tool, logresolve, specifi cally designed for this.  Even with HostnameLookups turned off, there are still some situations in which Apache performs  DNS lookups. For example, if you use hostnames in access clauses such as Allow From and  Deny From, a two-way lookup will be performed on the client — fi rst to resolve the IP address to  a hostname, and then to resolve the hostname back to an IP address  to ensure you get back to the  same IP . Generally, such access rules are used only on restricted areas, though, so the impact on   nonmischievous  users should be minimal. However, if you’re in the habit of blocking sitewide  access based on hostname  for example, blocking a whole ISP or country , you should be aware of  this performance hit. Again, using a local caching, resolving nameserver can help.  c07.indd   148 c07.indd   148  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Apache  ❘  149  Disabling .htaccess Files  When Apache receives a request, it must backtrack up the directory tree checking for the exis- tence of any .htaccess fi les. For example, if a request is made for http:  www.example.com  news 2012 July stories.html, it would check for the existence of  var www example.com  news 2012 July .htaccess,  var www example.com news 2012 .htaccess,  var www  example.com news .htaccess, and  var www example.com .htaccess  assuming the document  root is  var www example.com, of course .   Although this isn’t a huge performance issue, you can eliminate it nevertheless by setting  AllowOverride None  disabling .htaccess fi les  and putting your .htaccess rules directly in the  Apache confi guration fi les. This makes it a little inconvenient to edit your rules because you must  restart Apache after making any changes. But on a production server, such changes should be rare  anyway.  Dealing with symlinks  For the sake of security, Apache can be confi gured not to follow symlinks, or to follow them only if  they have the correct ownerships. As with .htaccess fi les, this involves backtracking up the  directory tree and checking if any component of the path is a symlink. If you’re willing to forgo  these security checks, you can improve performance a little by telling Apache not to care about  symlinks like so:  Options +FollowSymLinks -SymLinksIfOwnerMatch  DirectoryIndex Wildcards  It’s standard to specify a list of directory index fi les, in order of preference:  DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm index.pl  But there is a lazier option, as shown here:  DirectoryIndex index  This causes any fi lename beginning with the string index to match. Needless to say, this method  doesn’t result in great performance, and the former way should be used.  Setting SendBuff erSize  This SendBufferSize directive controls how much data Apache writes out to a socket before block- ing  that is, waiting for a response, or acknowledgment, from the client . Raising this value means  that Apache can send more data without blocking, which can be useful on high-latency links.   An ideal size for the buffer would be slightly larger than the biggest web page you have, allowing  you to send the whole document in one chunk without needing to wait for acknowledgments from  the client. But, in practice, it may be that you have one or two unusually large documents, and you  should simply aim for SendBufferSize to be large enough for the majority of web pages.   c07.indd   149 c07.indd   149  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   150  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  NOTE  Incidentally, setting this value to zero causes Apache to use the buffer  sizes set by the operating system. Also, setting SendBufferSize to a value higher  than the kernel’s TCP send buffer won’t have any effect.  Examining Caching Options  Caching is a vital part of high-traffi c websites. In addition to operating system-level disk buffering,  PHP opcode caches, client-side caching, caching proxies, and the MySQL query cache, Apache also  provides its own caching support. This section looks at Apache’s caching options and discusses their  advantages and disadvantages.  Apache actually offers several server-level caching modules  not to be confused with the likes of  mod_expires and mod_headers, which can be used to encourage client-side caching . Some of these  are interconnected, and because they all have similar names, things can get a little confusing.  mod_cache  The primary caching module is mod_cache, which provides a fl exible and powerful caching solu- tion. In turn, mod_cache relies on a storage module, and the current choices are mod_disk_cache  and mod_mem_cache  nothing to do with memcache . So, if you use mod_cache, you must also enable  either mod_disk_cache or mod_mem_cache.  NOTE  You learn more about memcache in Chapter 10, “Utilizing NoSQL  Solutions.”  mod_disk_cache  As the name implies, mod_disk_cache provides disk-based storage of cached fi les and provides  directives controlling the cache root, fi le size limits, and directory structures.   For each cached HTML document, two fi les are created: one containing the headers and the other  containing the document. The fi lename is based on a 22-character hash of the resource  including  the protocol, path, query string, port, and hostname , and fi les can optionally be stored in a hierar- chy by setting the CacheDirLevels directive.   For example, with three levels of depth, a cache fi le named abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv would be  stored as a b c defghijklmnopqrstuv. With 64 possible characters  case-sensitive, alphanumeric ,  this gives you a maximum of 64 directories at any one level. Setting CacheDirLevels gives you a  way to limit the number of fi les in a given directory because a large number of fi les in a single direc- tory can cause performance problems with many fi lesystems.  The real power of caching comes on dynamically generated code. But even static documents can  benefi t from disk caching. This may seem surprising because you’re still reading from disk, but  fi les served from the cache bypass many of Apache’s fi lters and handlers — .htaccess rules,  for example. Figure 7-1 shows the fl ow of events when a client make requests to a server using  mod_disk_cache.   c07.indd   150 c07.indd   150  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Apache  ❘  151  Client requests  resource  Is the  resource in the  cache?

NO  NO  Yes  Update cache  Return resource   to client  Cache resource  FIGURE 7-1  When Apache receives a request, it fi rst checks if the resource exists in the cache. If it doesn’t,  mod_cache fetches it from the back-end server and returns it to the client, caching it in the process   if it is deemed cacheable . If the resource is in the cache but has expired, mod_cache sends a   conditional GET request to the back-end server, asking for a fresh copy only if the resource has  been modifi ed. The cache is then updated — either with a fresh copy of the document or with fresh   expiration headers.  By default, mod_disk_cache caches items for 1 hour; although this can easily be changed using  CacheDefaultExpire. However, if the resource contains its own expiration times, these take prece- dence. It’s worth noting, though, that even expired resources are often served faster from the cache  than noncached resources because mod_cache needs to perform only a conditional GET on the back- end server. Typically, this simply involves using a stat   call to check to see if the fi le’s size or last  modifi ed time has changed..   It should also be remembered that not all resources are deemed cachable — for example, if they con- tain Authorization headers or are in response to requests with POSTed data. In addition, resources  with query strings won’t be cached unless they contain suitable Expires or Cache-Control headers.  This brings up the subject of cache performance and effi ciency. If you do decide to cache resources  with query strings, resources with differing query strings will be stored as separate entries in the  cache.  As you have already seen, the cache entry key is composed of the full URL.  In some cases,  this is the right thing to do — news.php?page=1 will clearly contain different contents from news .php?page=2. But other times, this is undesirable.   For example, news.php?sessionid=12345 could well be the same as news.php?sessionid=23456  if you simply use the query string to track session data.  But, on the other hand, the pages might  show slightly different content based on the user’s session.  You can ignore all query string   c07.indd   151 c07.indd   151  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   152  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  components with CacheIgnoreQueryString On, but it makes more sense to ignore only some keys,  which you can achieve like so:  CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers sessionid id  In these examples, query string keys named sessionid or id will be stripped from the URL before  it is hashed into a cache fi lename.  It’s also worth turning on UseCanonicalNames in httpd.conf so that http:  www.example.com  foo.html and http:  example.com foo.html are not stored as two separate cache entries, which  is probably not what you want.  mod_disk_cache provides basic maintenance of fi les stored in the cache, removing entries if they  are no longer valid. However, it has no controls on the overall size of the cache, and regular mainte- nance is usually needed to stop the cache from becoming too large.  Although, if disk space permits,  there’s certainly nothing wrong with this.   Htcacheclean is a tool shipped with Apache that you can use to keep the cache size in check. In can  be run either as a daemon  in which case it actively monitors cache entries being added removed  or  as a standalone application that can be run via cron. You simply pass the maximum cache size to  htcacheclean, which then ensures that the cache does not grow larger than this.   Alternatively, you can roll your own solution, allowing more intelligence over purging. For example,  less frequently accessed entries could be removed in preference to more frequently used entries, or  static resources could be purged in preference to cached dynamic content  because the latter is typi- cally more expensive to generate .  mod_mem_cache  The second storage module for mod_cache is mod_mem_cache, which provides in-memory caching.  It offers two different caching modes: caching of documents and caching of open fi le descriptors.  Although the caching of documents is the preferable mode, memory is a scarce resource, and cach- ing of open fi le descriptors provides a good trade-off between memory usage and performance gain.   It may seem automatic to choose mod_mem_cache over mod_disk_cache — after all, you know  that memory-based caches are several orders of magnitude faster than disk-based caches. However,  mod_mem_cache has one subtle  but signifi cant  drawback that limits its effectiveness. It operates on  a per-process basis.   If you set a 10 MB maximum cache size and have 20 Apache processes running, each process  will have its own private memory cache up to 10 MB in size. Entries cannot be shared across  these caches, and the cache will be destroyed when the process is destroyed  for example, when  MaxRequestsPerChild is reached . Not only does this cause this method of caching to be ineffi cient,  it also signifi cantly increases the potential memory usage.  You can alleviate this to some degree by setting a higher value for MaxRequestsPerChild. But  unless you have a small set of resources that are accessed heavily, mod_mem_cache is rarely as  useful as you might have hoped. In addition because Linux caches disk I O, it’s likely that many  of the resources cached by mod_disk_cache can actually reside in memory already, lessening the  potential advantage of memory-based caching.  c07.indd   152 c07.indd   152  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Apache  ❘  153  mod_ﬁ le_cache  An alternative to mod_cache is mod_file_cache, which implements a more basic form of caching  without many of the features offered by mod_cache. As with mod_mem_cache, mod_file_cache  offers both the caching of fi le handles and the contents of fi les in memory, and it is aimed fi rmly at  static content that rarely changes.  To use the module, you specify in httpd.conf a list of fi les handles to be loaded at startup, as  shown here:  CacheFile  var www html index.html     Cache file handle CacheFile  var www html contact.html MmapFile  var www html about.html    Map file into memory  As with mod_mem_cache, there are memory-scaling issues here. Each child process receives its own  private copy of the cache, so you must be careful not to over-allocate memory.   There are a few drawbacks to this module. There is nothing in the way of cache management  such  as expiring or revalidation of stale resources . If a fi le fi le handle is in the cache, it is used. If not,  the cache is ignored. If you want to add new entries to the cache or expire old ones, you must restart  Apache  and possibly edit httpd.conf . And all cache entries are held in memory. In the case of  large caches, it is usually best to opt for disk-based caching and let the operating system buffer the  more frequently accessed entries in memory.  mod_memcache_cache  One of the strengths of Apache is that anyone can write a module. Although the previously covered  caching modules form part of the standard Apache distribution, third-party solutions do exist.  One such module is mod_memcache_cache  http:  code.google.com p modmemcachecache  ,  which is a storage module for mod_cache  like mod_mem_cache or mod_disk_cache  that uses  memcached as the back end. Using a network-aware back end opens up new possibilities. Your cache  is no longer confi ned to the available RAM on the web server, and you can balance the cache among  multiple memcached nodes. If you run a pool of web servers, each can access a common cache,  which is hugely more effi cient  in terms of cache size and duplication  than each web server having  its own private cache.  NOTE  You learn more about memcache in Chapter 10.  Although activity on mod_memcache_cache is low, it hopefully illustrates the potential for building  new caching structures.  Monitoring with mod_status  Aside from a highly useful logging module that enables you to compile all manner of usage statistics,  Apache also provides a real-time monitoring module in the form of mod_status. When enabled, this  module provides a URL that you can visit to view a scoreboard containing a breakdown of all the  requests currently handled.  c07.indd   153 c07.indd   153  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   154  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Enabling is as simple as loading the module, setting a URL through which the status page can be  accessible, and confi guring a list of hosts allowed to view the page. The following example also  turns ExtendedStatus on, which gives a more detailed report:  LoadModule status_module mod_status.so   SetHandler server-status ExtendedStatus On  Order Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from 1.2.3.4     With these rules in place, you can head over to http:  example.com my-server-status to view  the breakdown. The fi rst part of the output shows some overall server statistics — uptime, number  of resources served, CPU usage, and average requests per second:  Server uptime: 13 hours 23 minutes 18 seconds  Total accesses: 771875 - Total Traffic: 6.5 GB  CPU Usage: u442.53 s10 cu.02 cs0 - .939% CPU load  16 requests sec - 140.4 kB second - 8.8 kB request  30 requests currently being processed, 21 idle workers   Next is the scoreboard showing what each Apache child process is currently doing:  K_CKKK_CK__.WW_K_K__KK__.K_K___KW.W..KKK_C.K.CK..K......._C..... ..._..._._K.KK_...._............................................ ...................... Scoreboard Key: "_" Waiting for Connection, "S" Starting up, "R" Reading Request, "W" Sending Reply, "K" Keepalive  read , "D" DNS Lookup, "C" Closing connection, "L" Logging, "G" Gracefully finishing, "I" Idle cleanup of worker, "." Open slot with no current process  In this example, the majority of children are idle  as denoted by a period . The rest are in varying  stages of handling requests. Some are sending a reply to the client, others are initiating the connec- tion, but the majority are in the Keep Alive status. They’ve already handled one request and are  listening for others. This gives you a useful at-a-glance overview of what Apache is up to.  The remainder of the status page provides a breakdown of what each Apache child process is cur- rently doing: the request being handled  if any , the vhost, client IP, and various stats on CPU mem- ory usage and processing time. Following is an example:  Srv PID  Acc         M  CPU SS Req Conn Child Slot  Client  Vhost      Request 4-0 6110 0 142 10263 _ 10.47 0 0   0.0  1.30  83.25 x.x.x.x xxx.com GET        favicon.ico HTTP 1.1  SrvChild Server number - generation  PID OS process ID  Acc Number of accesses this connection   this child   this slot   c07.indd   154 c07.indd   154  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Apache  ❘  155  M Mode of operation  CPU CPU usage, number of seconds  SS Seconds since beginning of most recent request  Req Milliseconds required to process most recent request  Conn Kilobytes transferred this connection  Child Megabytes transferred this child  Slot Total megabytes transferred this slot  If Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  support is enabled in Apache, a fi nal section of the page shows some  SSL-related statistics.  NOTE  You can learn more about SSL in Chapter 11, “Working with Secure  Sockets Layer  SSL .”  mod_status is useful  and many monitoring tools like munin generate graphs based on its output ,  but there is a performance hit to enabling it with ExtendedStatus On. Each time Apache handles a  request, it makes two calls to gettimeofday  . This isn’t a killer, but it’s a needless expense if you  have no intention to use mod_status. So, as always, if you don’t need it, disable it.  Using Content Compression  Content compression is one of the most important things you can do to improve performance, and  you fi rst met it in Chapter 3, “Content Compression.” The focus then was client-side support,  and the practicalities of implementing compression on specifi c web servers was left open for this  discussion. This section looks at how to set up content compression in Apache, potential gotchas,  and how to deliver precompressed content.  mod_deﬂ ate  In the Apache 1.x series, mod_gzip was the stock compression module. Version 2 of Apache intro- duces mod_deflate as its replacement, and although the two are similar, they are not identical.   You may want to refer back to the discussion of deflate versus gzip in Chapter 3.  The perfor- mance differences between gzip and deflate are minor, and because Apache 2 supports only  mod_deflate, the differences are academic.  Assuming mod_deflate has been compiled, the following example can cause some of the most com- mon plain-text resources to be compressed:  LoadModule deflate_module  usr lib apache2 modules mod_deflate.so             AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text html text plain text xml text css                application x-javascript application javascript           DeflateCompressionLevel 9    You specify the resource by its MIME type  rather than, say, fi le extension . These can vary a little  from platform to platform. For example, sometimes JavaScript is application javascript,  application x-javascript, or even text javascript, and you may want to verify the   c07.indd   155 c07.indd   155  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   156  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Content-Type header being set on such resources  for example, using HTTP Live Headers for  Firefox  before you add the deflate fi lters.  Some older browsers  most notably Netscape 4.x  have trouble handling defl ated contents; either  all defl ated resources, or resources other than the HTML document. The following  somewhat old   rules are often seen on the Internet for working around this:   Netscape 4.x has some problems... BrowserMatch ^Mozilla 4 gzip-only-text html   Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems BrowserMatch ^Mozilla 4\.0[678] no-gzip   MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine  BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text html   NOTE: Due to a bug in mod_setenvif up to Apache 2.0.48  the above regex won't work. You can use the following  workaround to get the desired effect: BrowserMatch \bMSI[E] !no-gzip !gzip-only-text html  In reality, though, these rules probably aren’t necessary. Netscape 4.08 dates back to 1998, and the  latest release in the 4.x series was version 4.8 in 2002. Stats from statcounter.com show Netscape  had a mere 0.07 percent of the market in 2008. These days, its market share is so low  0.01 percent  for August 2012, according to statcounter.com  that it is generally just lumped in to the “other  browsers” category in stats reports. Aside from that, Netscape 4’s CSS support was so messed up  that there’s a good chance your site won’t render correctly in it anyway.  As its name suggests, the DeflateCompressionLevel controls the level of compression — 1 is the  lowest and 9 the highest. As usual, this is a trade-off between better compression and high CPU  usage. The differences are modest. Setting a compression level of 9 won’t cause a big increase in  CPU usage but won’t cause a big decrease in content size either. Feel free to experiment with differ- ent values for DeflateCompressionLevel, but in the section, “Precompressing Content,” later in  this chapter, you’ll learn about a more powerful method that eliminates this trade-off.  Aside from setting the compression level, mod_deflate offers a few other options:   ➤ DeflateBufferSize   — This is the size of the buffer to use. When the buffer is  full, mod_deflate compresses it and fl ushes it to the client, so this is effectively the block  size.   ➤ DeflateMemLevel   — This is how much memory is available for mod_deflate to use  when compressing. Rather than specifying the number of bytes, a value in the range 1 to 9  is given.   ➤ DeflateWindowSize   — Accepting a value between 1 and 15, this controls the win-  dow size used during compression.  Recall that zlib  the underlying compression method used by mod_deflate  uses a history win- dow when searching for multiple occurrences of a string. Thus, a larger window and buffer size  give greater opportunity for compression, at the expense of slightly higher memory and CPU usage.   c07.indd   156 c07.indd   156  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Apache  ❘  157  Again, it’s a case of experimenting to see what works best in practice. But setting these values to the  maximum shouldn’t cause any serious problems, and will give the best levels of compression  albeit  possibly only a slight increase .  Precompressing Content  The big drawback to mod_deflate is that it offers no way to serve up precompressed content.  Although the memory and CPU usage from defl ating content on-the-fl y isn’t huge, it’s incredibly  wasteful to compress a relatively static HTML document each time it is requested. It is better to  compress the resource in advance and then serve this up. The old mod_gzip in Apache 1 offered this,  as does Nginx  as you’ll see soon . But if you want to precompress with mod_deflate, a few ugly  hacks are needed.  Things become complicated because not all clients support compression. So, you can’t just zip up  your fi les and serve this. You must keep two copies of each: one compressed and one uncompressed.  You then need a bit of magic to ensure that the correct content is served to the client, based on  whether the client advertises gzip compression support.  Using mod_rewrite  Assume that you have an external script named init.js. The fi rst step is to create a compressed  copy  using gzip, or compatible  named init.js.gz. Because this is one-off compression, you can  afford to set the highest compression level available, as shown here:  Next, you use some rules in .htaccess  or httpd.conf  to set the MIME type on all .js.gz fi les to  text javascript and to send the Content-Encoding: gzip header:  $ gzip -9 init.js $ ls -1 init.js init.js.gz    ForceType text javascript Header set Content-Encoding: gzip    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Encoding} gzip RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \. jscss $ RewriteRule ^  .* $  $1.gz [L,QSA]  Finally, you redirect the client to the .gz version of the fi le, if it advertises compression support via  the Accept-Encoding: gzip header:  Thus, if the client requests init.js and supports compression, init.js.gz will be served up to it.  Using Content Negotiation  The downside to use the mod_rewrite method is the extra load on the server. mod_rewrite isn’t the  leanest of modules, and regular expressions are relatively expensive. An alternative technique makes  use of type-map fi les and content negotiation.  c07.indd   157 c07.indd   157  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   158  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Again, you start with two copies of the resource: a compressed version and a plain version. You then  create a type-map fi le  traditionally the .var extension is added, so init.js.var  containing the  following:  URI: init.js Content-Type: text javascript; charset=UTF-8  URI: index.js.gz Content-Type: text javascript; charset=UTF-8 Content-Encoding: gzip  The type-map fi le is divided into blocks  each separated by a blank line  that defi ne different content  types, depending on what the client is willing to accept. The fi rst block is the default  the uncom- pressed JavaScript , whereas the second  the compressed script  is delivered if the client advertises  gzip support.   Finally, you must tell Apache to treat fi les with the .var extension as type-maps and set the appro- priate content-type headers on .js.gz fi les. These rules can be in either the main httpd.conf or a  .htaccess fi le:  AddHandler type-map .var AddType text javascript js.gz AddEncoding x-gzip .gz  Now, if the client requests init.js.var, the appropriate resource will be returned.  This is certainly funky to set up, but it does avoid the need for mod_rewrite. In this example, the  link to the resource changed as well  from .js to .js.var . If you’re careful, you could defi ne .js  as the type-map fi le and use, say, .js.uncompressed for the uncompressed version of the fi le to  avoid having to rename fi les in your HTML code.  While Apache is a very powerful and popular web server, it is by no means the only option, and in  the next section you’ll learn about some of the most popular alternatives.  LOOKING BEYOND APACHE  Although you have seen lots of ways in which Apache performance can be tuned, many would argue  that Apache is built on a model that is fundamentally unable to deliver high performance  more  on this in a minute  — no matter how much tuning you do. Coupled with the fact that Apache is a  general-purpose web server, the search is on for a mean, lean alternative.   In this section, you discover one of Apache’s main competitors, Nginx, and learn how it can be used  to complement Apache, or even replace it. This will then lead to a look at how web servers can be  clustered and load-balanced.   Nginx  Nginx  pronounced “engine X”  appeared on the scene in the mid-2000s, and although initial  uptake was slow because of lack of documentation, it has quickly gained in popularity. Many   c07.indd   158 c07.indd   158  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Looking Beyond Apache  ❘  159  surveys now show it to be the third most used web server  behind Apache and IIS , and it is particu- larly popular for high-traffi c sites.  Nginx’s structure is notably different from Apache’s. As you have seen, Apache uses processes or  threads  depending on the MPM used , each of which use signifi cant resources  not to mention the  overhead involved in creating and destroying child processes . By contrast, Nginx uses an asyn- chronous, event-driven model, which removes the need for each request to be handled as a separate  child thread. Instead there is a single master process with one or more worker processes.   The performance impact of this change is huge. Whereas each additional Apache process consumes  an extra 4 MB or 5 MB  if the likes of mod_php have been loaded, this fi gure will be more like 15+  MB  of memory, the impact of additional concurrent requests on Nginx is tiny. The result is that  Nginx can handle a huge number of concurrent requests — much more than Apache, even with the  newer threaded MPM.  Conﬁ guration  The discussions earlier in this chapter skipped the basics of Apache confi guration because it was  assumed you had some knowledge of this already  because of Apache’s ubiquitous nature . The same  isn’t necessarily true for Nginx, though, and many administrators are cautious about straying away  from the safety of Apache. So, let’s look at various Nginx confi guration options, including a com- plete minimum confi guration.  The confi guration of Nginx has changed a little over the years, and the structure of confi guration  fi les tends to vary from system to system. For example, installing Nginx from under Debian results  in the sites-enabled and sites-available directories, familiar to Debian Apache users. In general,  though, confi guration fi les for Nginx on UNIX or Linux live under  etc nginx, with the master  fi le being  etc nginx nginx.conf.   As with Apache, this may, in turn, reference other confi guration fi les using the include syntax. As  of this writing, the default confi g fi le shipped with the Nginx Debian package looks like this:  user www-data; worker_processes  1;  error_log   var log nginx error.log; pid         var run nginx.pid;  events {     worker_connections  1024;      multi_accept on; }  http {     include        etc nginx mime.types;     access_log   var log nginx access.log;      sendfile        on;     tcp_nopush     on;      keepalive_timeout  65;  c07.indd   159 c07.indd   159  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   160  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS      tcp_nodelay        on;      gzip  on;     gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\. ?!.*SV1 ";      include  etc nginx conf.d *.conf;     include  etc nginx sites-enabled *; }  Let’s spend some time looking through a few of these options. This isn’t intended to be an exhaus- tive guide to confi guring Nginx  you can fi nd plenty of documentation on http:  wiki.nginx .org , so let’s just concentrate on performance-related options.  Worker Processes and CPU Affi  nity As previously mentioned, Nginx does not use the process-per-request model of traditional web serv- ers, so why would it need multiple worker processes? Certainly, Nginx can run just fi ne with this  option left to the default value of 1, but on machines with multiple processing cores, increasing the  number of workers can be advantageous.   A lot depends on workload. When using SSL or gzip compression  both of which are CPU- intensive , CPU bottlenecks can occur. Remember that a single process can be executed only on one  core, so with worker_processes set to 1, Nginx can max out only a single CPU core, leaving the  others idle. A good starting point, therefore, is to set worker_processes to the number of CPU  cores on the system. Raising it above this level is unlikely to produce any benefi t — if anything, per- formance will degrade a little from an increase in context switching.  Disk I O also causes bottlenecks, and although there is no advantage to having multiple workers  all reading from the same disk at once  overall throughput will still be the same , when content is  spread over multiple disks, you can raise the amount of parallel reading by increasing worker_ processes to equal the number of disks on which web content is stored.  Don’t forget any writes to  access error logs, too.   With processor affi nity, Linux might schedule all worker processes to run on the same CPU, which  is almost certainly not what you want. The worker_cpu_affinity directive enables you to control  this.  Each option to worker_cpu_affinity is a bit mask specifying on which CPU a worker should run.  Thus, on a quad-core machine, you’d probably set worker_processes to 4 and would need to spec- ify four bit masks to worker_cpu_affinity, as shown here:  worker_cpu_affinity 1000 0100 0010 0001  This can be particularly useful for processors that support hyper-threading because you can assign  a worker to multiple logical processors. For example, a mask for 0101 assigns a worker to both the  fi rst and third processors.  Concurrency Nginx has no MaxClients directive, but the worker_connections option in the events block  serves a similar purpose. This limit is per-worker. So, with worker_connections set to 1024, and  worker_processes set to 8, you allow a maximum of 8,192 simultaneous connections.  c07.indd   160 c07.indd   160  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Looking Beyond Apache  ❘  161  With Apache’s prefork MPM, you could estimate an approximate value for MaxClients by looking  at the typical memory usage of a child process. But this doesn’t work for a worker model such as  Nginx  or Apache’s worker MPM, for that matter . The good news is that setting too high of a limit  on concurrency doesn’t tend to risk sending the system into a downward spiral, the way it does with  Apache, so you can afford to be fairly liberal.   Watching CPU RAM use of Nginx workers and monitoring disk I O and CPU blocking  for exam- ple, with vmstat  can be useful to identify bottlenecks if you are too optimistic with worker_ connections. But, in reality, most bottlenecks occur in things like the PHP subsystem  which  you’ll learn about in Chapter 12, “Optimizing PHP” .  tcp_nodelay and tcp_nopush In the earlier discussion about Apache’s SendBufferSize directive, you learned about the potential  usefulness of sending the entire HTTP response in a single chunk, without waiting for a response  from the client.  In Nginx, tcp_nodelay serves a similar purpose, instructing the server to use the TCP_NODELAY  option when creating a socket. tcp_nopush  which passes the TCP_NOPUSH option to the socket  has  a similar effect and can cause Nginx to attempt to send out HTTP headers inside a single packet. It’s  generally worth enabling both of these options.  NOTE  tcp_nodelay and tcp_nopush are discussed in more detail in Appendix A,  “TCP Performance.”  sendﬁ le As with Apache, you can use sendfile to provide faster serving of static fi les. Rather than read- ing the contents of a fi le into userspace  that is, the web server , sendfile enables the web server to  simply copy the data from one fi le descriptor to another  the latter being a socket . This is all done  inside the kernel, making it more effi cient. Naturally, this works only on static fi les that don’t con- tain any dynamic code.  Disk I O In theory, you can improve performance substantially by using Asynchronous I O  AIO  to perform  nonblocking disk reads and writes. Rather than sitting and waiting for data to be read from disk,  Nginx can continue execution and be alerted when the data becomes available.   This sounds great in theory, but there are a number of drawbacks under Linux.  Note that some  operating systems such as FreeBSD don’t have these limitations.   For starters, you can’t use sendfile and must use direct I O  O_DIRECT . This causes the fi le to  bypass Linux’s disk caches, so you don’t benefi t from having the fi le potentially cached in memory.  Usually, you want this caching, but in a few situations, not caching is better. For example, if the fi le  is large  say a video , you probably don’t want to fi ll your disk buffers with it. Similarly, if you have  a large working set  too large to all fi t in memory  being accessed in a fairly distributed manner, the  disk cache may not help much. In these two cases, the benefi ts of AIO can outweigh the drawbacks.  c07.indd   161 c07.indd   161  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   162  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  The Nginx documentation gives the following example of AIO usage:  location  video {     aio on;      directio 512;      output_buffers 1 128k; }  You need to explicitly enable direct I O and have the option of also setting a minimum size. Only  fi les larger than this size will be read using direct I O. It makes a lot of sense to use only AIO on  directories containing large fi les — at least until the Linux implementation improves. For direct I O,  it’s worth experimenting with using it globally with a high value to prevent large fi les from polluting  your disk caches. But remember that enabling direct I O causes sendfile to be disabled.  sendfile isn’t always the ideal method for reading from disk. Because the operating system reads  the data in fairly small chunks, there may be a lot of seeking back and forth on busy systems, as the  operating system attempts to read multiple fi les at once. When sendfile is disabled  or isn’t being  used because you’re serving dynamic content , you can control the size of the chunks of data that are  read from disk using output_buffers, as shown here:  output_buffers 2 512k;  This causes Nginx to create two buffers in memory, each of 512 KB. When handling requests, it  then attempts to read 512 KB of data from disk in one chunk, before processing it. The 512 KB  should be big enough to hold even a large HTML document.  Compression  As you’d expect, Nginx supports gzip compression, and the options are mostly similar to Apache’s.  You can set the compression level  1 through to 9 , a list of MIME types to compress, the capability  to disable compression for certain user agents, and a minimum document length.  It’s generally not  worth compressing small documents because the additional gzip headers cancel out any saving.   Nginx also has the capability to serve up precompressed contents via the Gzip Precompression  module  --with-http_gzip_static_module . However, this module is not compiled in by default.  With this module enabled — and gzip_static set to on — Nginx can check for the existence of a  precompressed version of the requested fi le, and return this in preference to the original if it has a  newer timestamp. Thus, if a client requests http:  www.example.com news archive.html, Nginx  checks for the existence of archive.html.gz in the news directory of the document root.   If Nginx doesn’t fi nd a precompressed version of the requested document, the standard gzip module  kicks in  if it is turned on  and compresses the document on-the-fl y. It won’t save a compressed copy  for future use, though. Creating the precompressed fi les is an exercise for the system administrator.  A small shell script can be used to recursively compress the documents under the web root.  Another benefi t of precompressing is that you can use the highest compression level because you  will presumably compress only occasionally, when static pages have been edited. Usually, the lowest  compression level gives the best compromise between size and compression speed. You don’t have to  use gzip because there are alternatives that offer slightly better compression levels.  c07.indd   162 c07.indd   162  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Looking Beyond Apache  ❘  163  With Nginx, you also have control over the size of the gzip buffer s . Actually, that’s not entirely  true. The buffer is a fi xed size of 4 KB  one page of memory , but you can increase the number of  buffers. Under Linux, the current defaults are as follows:  gzip_buffers 16 k  Note that, since the individual buffer size is fi xed, the second argument here has no effect.  NOTE  Most operating systems handle memory in fi xed size blocks known as  pages. On x86 and x64 architectures, the most common page size is 4 KB, with  Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows all using this default. On the SPARC architecture   mostly used for Solaris , 8 KB pages are the default.  So, with 16 buffers, each at 84KB, you would have 64 KB. Thus, the maximum size for your  compressed contents is 64 KB. That’s enough for most purposes because the uncompressed contents  would likely be approximately 5 to 10 times this size. But if you plan to compress large documents,  the number of buffers can be increased as necessary.  Modules  Development of Nginx is currently moving at quite a rapid pace, often with several releases per  month. As such, precompiled Windows binaries and the package repositories of most Linux UNIX  distributions will be quite behind  especially for those distributions that favor stability over bleed- ing edge , and Nginx is one of those applications where it’s defi nitely a good idea to compile from  source.  Unlike Apache, Nginx does not support dynamically loadable modules — everything needs to be  compiled in. And, as usual, package maintainers tend to favor more rather than less. The result is a  packaged binary that probably contains more modules than you need  and maybe lacks some that  you do need  — although the performance penalty of extra modules is much lower than in Apache  because you aren’t running hundreds of child processes.  The full list of confi guration options for Nginx is available by running . configure --help   from inside the Nginx source directory . The defaults are quite sensible with support for Common  Gateway Interface  CGI , logging, basic authentication, gzip, URL rewriting, and so on, all being  included. A few of these standard modules may not be needed, though, and they must be explicitly  disabled. These include the following:   ➤ Support for server-side includes  SSIs    ➤ Load balancing  via the Upstream module    ➤ FastCGI, Simple CGI  SCGI , and uWSGI  NOTE  CGI isn’t just for Perl. If you want to use PHP under Nginx, you need  some form of CGI support.  c07.indd   163 c07.indd   163  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   164  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Of the modules not enabled by default in Nginx, the most likely ones that you’ll need include the  following:   ➤ SSL support   ➤ Stub Status  server stats    ➤ Real IP for correct logging of IP addresses in X-Forwarded-For headers  for example,   behind load balancers proxies   Aside from the offi cial modules, a healthy collection of third-party modules must be downloaded  separately and then compiled in. These include an enhanced FastCGI module  AFCGI , etags, a  fi lter for on-the-fl y stripping of excess whitespace from contents, and alternative load-balancing  techniques.  Nginx, Apache, and PHP  One of the biggest issues for users moving away from Apache is the lack of a PHP module in Nginx.  Whereas with Apache you can just load mod_php and happily run PHP scripts, with Nginx, you  must use CGI. This isn’t anywhere near as bad a performance issue as you might imagine, though,  and with a bit of work, you can equal the performance of Apache plus mod_php, and get a more fl ex- ible setup in the process.  FastCGI  fcgi   The main reason that CGI tends to be so slow is because a new process  be it Perl, Python, PHP, and  so on  must be forked to handle the request. FastCGI solves this by maintaining a pool of persistent  processes to handle CGI requests. When the web server needs to process a CGI script, it connects  to the FastCGI daemon over a socket and sends the request. FastCGI then delegates the request to  a free worker process and returns the response to the web server over the same socket. Figure 7-2  shows the topology of an Nginx-FastCGI setup.  Client  PHP daemons  FIGURE 7-2  Nginx  FastCGI Daemon  There’s nothing Nginx-specifi c about FastCGI. It’s a technique used for other web servers that don’t  natively support PHP  or similar , too. There’s even a FastCGI module for Apache. But why would  you want to go to the trouble to use FastCGI with Apache when mod_php, mod_perl, mod_python,  and so on, make life so much easier?   Separating the processing of your dynamic code from the web server actually has two signifi cant  benefi ts. First, you avoid the overhead of loading the scripting module for requests that might not   c07.indd   164 c07.indd   164  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Looking Beyond Apache  ❘  165  even contain dynamic code  for example, static HTML, images, and so on . Earlier in this chapter,  you learned how the likes of mod_php dramatically increase the memory footprint of each Apache  child. Second, it gives you the fl exibility to execute the PHP on a different server — or even spread  the load across a pool of servers.   FastCGI is by no means a poor man’s alternative to mod_php.  Setting Up FastCGI for PHP  Providing that PHP has been compiled with CGI support  or the appropriate php-cgi package  installed , you can use PHP 5’s built-in FastCGI support to launch the FastCGI daemon from the  command prompt like so:  export PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN=5 php-cgi -b 127.0.0.1:9000  In this example, the daemon can listen for incoming connections on 9000 TCP of the localhost.  The number of worker daemons to spawn is governed by the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environmental  variable. Alternatively, a simple init script can be used — the Nginx FastCGI documentation at  http:  wiki.nginx.org FcgiExample provides a suitable example.  With FastCGI running, all that is left is to tell Nginx to use it:  location ~ \.php$ {   include  etc nginx fcgi_params.conf;   fastcgi_pass  127.0.0.1:9000; }  In this example, any request ending with .php is passed to FastCGI. Note the inclusion of an  external fi le containing FastCGI confi guration options. The example given on the Nginx wiki is as  follows:  fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI 1.1; fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx; fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string; fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method; fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type; fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length; fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    $document_root$fastcgi_script_name; fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME        $fastcgi_script_name; fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri; fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri; fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root; fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol; fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr; fastcgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port; fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr; fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port; fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;  Aside from fastcgi_param, there are a few other fastcgi_* directives of interest from a perfor- mance perspective. fastcgi_buffers controls the number of buffers  as before, under Linux IA64,   c07.indd   165 c07.indd   165  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   166  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  each is 4 KB  used for reading in the response from the FastCGI daemon. Just to complicate matters,  Nginx also maintains a second buffer  controlled by fastcgi_buffer_size  used for the FastCGI  response header, and the fi rst part of the response. After this buffer has been fi lled, the buffers con- trolled by fastcgi_buffers are used to hold the remainder of the response. Again, the default is  one page, or probably 4 KB. For fastcgi_buffers, the default is eight buffers, giving 32 KB  8 × 4 + fastcgi_buffer_size   plus however big fastcgi_buffer_size is in total, but it’s worth raising this to approximately 256  to give just more than 1 MB of buffer space. Any response larger than the total buffer space is writ- ten to a temporary fi le on disk, so it makes sense to raise fastcgi_buffers to a value large enough  to hold the majority of responses.  Of course, the response contains the full HTML document, after  the PHP in it has been parsed.   You can disable the writing of oversized responses to disk by setting f astcgi_max_temp_file_size  to 0, but this isn’t recommended. Although it might seem tempting, with this option turned off,  FastCGI returns its response as fast as the client can read it  via Nginx, of course , which probably  is a lot slower than writing to disk. FastCGI is still relatively resource hungry, and you should aim  to minimize for how long each PHP worker runs. Nginx is much more suited for drip-feeding the  response to the client.  FastCGI Caching  Nginx supports the capability to cache responses from FastCGI, which has the potential to dramati- cally cut down on work load for the PHP workers. Caching dynamic pages is always tricky, though,  and you must take care not to cache  or make allowances for  user-specifi c copies of pages.  You  don’t want regular users to see admin-specifi c versions, for example.   Caching is enabled by setting a value for fastcgi_cache. This option takes an arbitrary string as  the name for the cache, as shown here:  fastcgi_cache  mycache;  As you’d expect, you can set the caching period, and Nginx offers the neat capability to specify dif- ferent values for different HTTP return codes. Thus, you might cache 200 OKs for a few hours, but  404s for a shorter period. By default, only 200, 301, and 302 codes are cached, but you can easily  override this, as shown here:  fastcgi_cache_valid    200 302 1d; fastcgi_cache_valid    301 7d; fastcgi_cache_valid    404 5m; fastcgi_cache_valid    any     10m;  NOTE  The any keyword serves as a catch-all, acting on any return code.  You also have the capability to set the key used for the cache entry. This requires a bit of thought,  however. If you use the script name as the key, you risk duplicates.  Imagine Nginx serving a dozen  virtual hosts, each with an index.php.  If you get around this by using the domain name plus the   c07.indd   166 c07.indd   166  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Looking Beyond Apache  ❘  167  script name, you hit issues when http:  example.com foo.php and https:  example.com foo .php contain different content. So, you must also include the protocol in the key, as shown here:  fastcgi_cache_key      $scheme$host$request_uri;  This results in keys such as http:  www.example.com foo.php?bar=baz, and also solves the  potential problem of different query strings resulting in different content being shown.  This still isn’t the end of the matter, though. Different HTTP methods can result in different  responses. For starters, you probably don’t want to cache POST requests — luckily, these are disabled  by default in Nginx. HEAD requests are more of an issue because these generate a blank response   save for the headers . If a client issues a HEAD request and the result is cached, subsequent GET  requests on the resource cause a blank page to be returned.  The best thing you can do is include the request method in the key name, as shown here:  fastcgi_cache_key      $scheme$host$request_uri$request_method;  This is not perfect because you are potentially cluttering the cache with cached HEAD responses. But  because they are small  and relatively uncommon , you needn’t worry too much about cache space.  A fi nal issue is how to deal with the caching of pages for logged-in users  or users who see specifi c  content for whatever reason . If you store authentication information  such as a session ID  in the  query string, all is well — you already know about including the query string in your cache key.  Passing a session ID in the query string isn’t great for security, though, and the usual method would  be to store authentication information in a cookie.   Again, the solution is to modify the cache key string, this time to add the value of a given cookie to  it. In Ngnix, you can access cookie data using the syntax $cookie_COOKIENAME. For example, if you  use $cookie_Userid, the cache key now looks something like this:  fastcgi_cache_key       $scheme$host$request_uri$request_method$cookie_userid$server_port;  FastCGI under Apache  Although mod_php is the most popular way of running PHP scripts under Apache, there is something  to be said for using FastCGI instead. First of all, it eliminates the overhead of loading the PHP inter- preter for every request, which is particularly useful if you are using Apache to serve static resources,  too  although, as noted, the likes of Nginx generally make better static fi le servers than Apache .  Secondly, it provides a scaling option, since the PHP FastCGI back ends can be distributed across  multiple servers. Perhaps more importantly, it also means that you can run Apache with the  worker MPM. As you saw earlier in this chapter in the section, “Multi-Processing Modules,”  the worker MPM is more effi cient, but does not sit well with mod_php.  From a non-performance perspective, it can also be used as a way of executing PHP code under the  user ID of the owner, rather than as the Apache user.  Installation Under Apache, mod_fcgid is currently the recommended module for providing FastCGI support.  Its licensing is less restrictive than the older alternative, mod_fastcgi. If you’ve compiled Apache   c07.indd   167 c07.indd   167  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   168  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  from source, you’ll need to manually download and build the mod_fcgid module  download from  http:  httpd.apache.org mod_fcgid  . On systems that use packages ports  for example,  FreeBSD, Ubuntu, or CentOS , it will probably be available from there.  On Debian, the package is  libapache2-mod-fcgid.   Conﬁ guration Confi guration is a simple case of loading the module, and then instructing Apache to use it for PHP  fi les  don’t forget to disable mod_php :  LoadModule fcgid_module modules mod_fcgid.so AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi .php MaxRequestsPerProcess       1000 MaxProcessCount             10 FCGIWrapper  usr bin php-cgi .php IdleTimeout                 240  Also, remember to ensure that +ExecCGI is listed in the Options directive for each vhost for which  you want to enable mod_fcgid.  The Best of the Rest  Although Apache might dominate the Linux and UNIX web server world, there is plenty of com- petition. In the past, the competition has tended to be heavyweight alternatives such as Apache  Tomcat, NCSA, Oracle, or  under Windows  IIS. But the past decade has seen increasing demand  for lightweight servers, such that the most interesting  and actively developed  web servers tend to be  in this area. You’ve already learned about one of these, Nginx, but there are numerous other alter- natives. Let’s take a closer look at a couple of alternatives.   lighttpd  Usually pronounced “lighty,” lighttpd offers a similar set of features to Nginx. A threaded model  enables for high concurrency and low resource usage, along with all the usual extras — FastCGI,  SSL, virtual hosting, URL rewriting, and SSI. Actually, lighttpd’s FastCGI implementation is more  integrated that that of Nginx and will spawn processes as  and when  needed without the need  for you to maintain a separate FastCGI daemon. lighttpd also has native support for standard  CGI — something missing in Nginx.  lighttpd’s other historical advantage over Nginx is that the documentation has been much better,  and confi guration has been simpler. Unfortunately, lighttpd was also bugged by reports of memory  leaks and benchmarks that showed higher CPU usage than Nginx. A lot of these factors are out- dated now. Documentation for Nginx has improved signifi cantly, and many of the alleged memory  leaks in lighttpd have either been fi xed or turned out to be false alarms.   Speaking of benchmarking, lighttpd versus Nginx is one of those subjects that provides as much  heated debate as vi versus emacs, or Linux versus BSD, and each side can invariably provide bench- marks that show Nginx is “better” than lighttpd, or vice versa. It’s worth remembering that these  benchmarks are often narrow, and often the tester will have more experience with one server than  the other, potentially leading to one having been confi gured better than the other.   c07.indd   168 c07.indd   168  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Multiserver Setups with Nginx and Apache  ❘  169  The benchmarking results are narrow because all they show is how the two servers cope with a  specifi c workload. For example, you might bombard Nginx and lighttpd with 10,000 requests for  a static 1 KB HTML document, and plot the average time taken to handle the request. Most likely,  the results will be close, but whichever server wins, benchmarking with say a 50 KB HTML docu- ment could produce different results.  Think of how sendfile or output_buffers could affect  Nginx performance here.   It’s also important to remember that performance isn’t just about how long it takes to serve a client’s  request. If a particular web server uses signifi cantly more CPU and memory than the other, a small  decrease in response time is often missing the point.   Overall, Nginx might be preferred over lighttpd because Nginx uses less resources in production  environments. It’s a close call, though, and when making your decision, just remember that a lot of  the pros and cons are outdated now.  thttpd stands for Tiny HTTPD or Turbo HTTPD  or various other things . thttpd is a small and  basic web server, which makes Nginx and lighttpd look feature-rich in comparison. Performance  doesn’t tend to be signifi cantly better than either Nginx or lighttpd, so thttpd’s main use is for spe- cialist situations —  for example, embedded applications because it is so small. However, it does sup- port CGI, so it is sometimes used alongside Nginx.  Although CGI modules are now available for  Nginx.   Development of thttpd seems to have ground to a halt, too, with the last stable release in 2003. For  these reasons, thttpd isn’t a suitable general-purpose, light web server these days.  thttpd  Node.js  Node.js is a JavaScript framework that can be used to create high-performance web servers  among  other things . It is built around Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, and uses an event-driven I O model  to provide high levels of concurrency.  Although relatively new  the fi rst release was in 2009 , Node.js has gained increasing popularity. Its  capability to provide PUSH services makes it a useful alternative to Comet technologies.   So far, you’ve seen how Apache and Nginx can work in single-server setups. Eventually, there will   hopefully  come a time when your website outgrows a single web server, and you must split tasks  across several servers. In the next section, you discover various ways in which Apache and Nginx  can run together.  MULTISERVER SETUPS WITH NGINX AND APACHE  You’ve now learned about some of the core performance-related features of Apache and looked at  one of its main lightweight competitors, Nginx. Although in many situations there’s a strong case  of abandoning Apache in favor of Nginx, a lot of system administrators are wary about leaving the  familiarity and safety of Apache completely  or still want to retain some of the advanced features  offered by Apache . Certainly it’s true that there’s a learning curve involved. You must learn a new  syntax of rewrite rules, probably set up some form of FastCGI scripting, and so on.   c07.indd   169 c07.indd   169  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   170  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  As a result, many administrators choose a dual-server setup, with Nginx handling static resources   where it excels  and Apache continuing to serve dynamic content such as PHP or Perl CGI scripts   where the advantages of Nginx are less clear cut .  There are two main ways to do this:    ➤ Running Apache and Nginx side by side  on different IP addresses    ➤ Using Nginx’s proxying abilities to forward requests for dynamic resources to an Apache   back-end server  Let’s look at the latter method fi rst.  Nginx as a Reverse Proxy to Apache  You can easily use Nginx as a reverse proxy to Apache using Nginx’s proxying support, as shown  in Figure 7-3. As shown in the following code snippet, Nginx is set up on 80 TCP of the public- facing IP address, and then Apache is confi gured to listen on a different port — say, 8080. If Nginx  receives a request for a static resource, it handles it itself; otherwise, it proxies the result on to the  back-end Apache server.   Client  GET logo.gif  Nginx handles request and returns response  Client  GET settings.php  Nginx relays response back to the client  FIGURE 7-3  Nginx listening on port 80  Nginx forwards request to Apache  Apache response  c07.indd   170 c07.indd   170  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Multiserver Setups with Nginx and Apache  ❘  171  location ~ ^  imagesjavascriptjscssmediastatic   { root  var www html ; expires 30d; }  location   { proxy_pass http:  127.0.0.1:8080; include  etc nginx proxy.conf; }  In other words, any URL under  images,  javascript,  js, and so on, is served directly.  Everything else is proxied to Apache listening on 8080 of the loopback interface.  Proxy Options  As you might expect, Nginx offers a wealth of proxy-related confi guration options, and it makes  sense to store them in an external fi le   etc nginx proxy.conf in the previous example  for reuse.  Let’s spend a few moments looking at these options.  proxy_redirect is needed only when the back end  for example, Apache  generates Location head- ers that must be rewritten — for example, to the URL of the front-end server. In most cases, you can  leave this turned off.  Nginx uses a similar approach to buffering proxy traffi c as it does for gzip and regular output.  Each buffer is a fi xed size  equal to one page of memory — usually 4 KB , but you can increase the  number of buffers to increase the overall size, as shown here:  proxy_buffers 20 4k   Again, note that the second parameter has no effect, because it is fi xed.   This gives a total of 80 KB. When buffering is enabled, Nginx reads the response from the back-end  server straight into the buffer and then feeds this back to the client as fast as the client can receive it.  With proxy buffering turned off, the rate at which Nginx reads from the back-end server is depen- dent on the rate at which the client can read the response from Nginx  because there is no tempo- rary buffer to hold the data . Because the back-end server is generally a lot heavier than Nginx, it  makes sense to minimize the time it spends handling requests, and proxy buffering should generally  be turned on  and the buffer size set large enough to handle the majority of responses .  One frequent problem is that, with a proxy in place, you lose the ability to track client IP addresses  in the back end  because all requests now appear to come from Nginx . The solution is to set the  following custom headers via Nginx:  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;  The back-end code  say, PHP running under Apache  can now access the X-Real-IP variable to  get the client’s true IP address  for example, $_SERVER['X-Real-IP'] . This isn’t much use if you   c07.indd   171 c07.indd   171  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   172  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  need to rewrite your application, though, and there’s a handy Apache module called mod_rpaf that  solves this problem:  LoadModule rpaf_module  usr lib apache2 modules mod_rpaf.so   RPAFenable On RPAFsethostname On RPAFproxy_ips 127.0.0.1    With rpaf in place  note RPAFproxy_ips has been set to the IP address of the Nginx server , the  proxy is effectively hidden, and you can access the client’s IP address in the usual way  for example,  $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR"] . This also eliminates the need to rewrite the Apache logging directives  to log the true IP address.  Nginx also offers a handful of options for controlling timeouts when talking to the back-end server.  You’ll learn more about these in the section, “Load Balancers,” later in this chapter.  Nginx and Apache Side by Side  Proxying requests for dynamic content through Nginx adds a small amount of latency to each  request response and also adds another point of failure. If Nginx goes down, both static and  dynamic content is affected. If you have only one Apache server and want to use Nginx for serving  static resources, a better solution is to run them both side by side on different IP addresses  but both  on the same machine . This ensures the least latency and means that if one web server daemon goes  down, the other isn’t affected.   To save on the use of an additional IP address  which, given the current IPv4 address space situa- tion, is a growing concern , you could run both web servers on the same IP address, but on different  ports — Apache on port 80, and Nginx on, say, 8080 — ensuring that the links to static resources in  your HTML documents contain the port number. Unfortunately, corporate and personal fi rewalls  are too varied to make this a reliable method. There are simply too many users whose browsers can- not access resources on anything other than ports 80 and 443.   Aside from these issues, an additional downside is that this model doesn’t scale so well. After you  reach the stage of needing multiple Apache servers, you’re going to need middleware in front of them  anyway  to handle load balancing . Nginx fi lls this role nicely, so you might as well just use it in  front of Apache from the start.   So far, you’ve seen how Nginx and Apache can co-exist, with Nginx proxying requests to Apache,  or sitting alongside it. Once you start proxying requests to multiple back-end servers, extra consid- erations arise. How does the system cope if one of the back-end servers goes down? In fact, how do  you even decide if a server is down — does it have to be completely unresponsive, or should it be  pulled out of the pool if the system load gets higher than a certain level? Should each server receive  an equal share of traffi c, or do some of the servers have better hardware than others?   Devices that proxy to multiple back-end servers are known as load balancers, and the questions  raised in the previous paragraph show just how involved the subject can be. In the following section,  you discover how to handle these issues and much more.  c07.indd   172 c07.indd   172  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Load Balancers  ❘  173  LOAD BALANCERS  Using Nginx to distribute requests across a pool of back-end servers is an example of the more  generic class of devices known as load balancers. Load balancers are often divided into software   typically open source applications running on generic PC hardware  and hardware.   But the distinction isn’t so clear-cut — after all, even hardware load balancers invariably run  some sort of software. There’s also a great range in load-balancer intelligence, from simple  round-robin handling of requests to more complex algorithms based on the health of individual  back-end servers. Many load balancers also include complementary features such as SSL accel- eration, traffi c shaping, and fi rewalling — more on these shortly, in the section, “Load Balancer  Features.”  In this section, you’ll learn some of the advanced features offered by load balancers, and how Nginx  and HAProxy can be used to provide highly confi gurable software-based balancing. But let’s start  by looking at the differences between hardware and software load balancers.  Hardware versus Software  Although the distinction is blurred  and the nomenclature somewhat inaccurate , it’s still useful to  think in terms of software and hardware load balancers.   Hardware load balancers often run on special hardware and contain any software pre-installed and  confi gured by the vendor. Management is usually performed through a web interface. This makes  them a black box in many ways, which can be a blessing or a curse. You can’t hack in new features  or changes, but you are also relieved from having to set up and maintain the system. Hardware load  balancers also have the potential to offer the lowest latency  although, in practice, the difference in  latency compared to a well-tuned software load balancer is relatively small .  By contrast, software load balancers usually just run on standard PC hardware, using applications  like Nginx and HAProxy. This provides a huge amount of control over the balancing but can take  longer to set up and monitor.   Hardware load balancers generally operate on Layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model  see Chapter 1, “A  Refresher on Web Browsers,” for more information about the OSI model  and simply work in terms  of TCP IP packets — routing traffi c to back-end servers and possibly handling Network Address  Translation  NAT . Software load balancers have the capability of operating on Layer 7  the OSI  application layer  and, as such, can “talk” HTTP. They can perform the compression of resources  passing through, and perform routing based on the presence of cookies  based on the request URL  and so on .   Balancers that operate solely on Layers 3 and 4 tend to be a little faster and have high capacity   because there isn’t the need to analyze the Layer 7 contents . However, they are also less intelligent  and fl exible. In practice, many hardware load balancers also support Layer 7.  So which is best? There’s no concrete answer to that question. Both are perfectly viable solutions.  However, the following discussion concentrates on software load balancing.  c07.indd   173 c07.indd   173  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   174  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Load Balancer Features  Load balancing might seem like quite a straightforward task — spread a series of requests evenly  over a bunch of back-end servers. But deciding what “evenly” means can actually be rather com- plicated. Let’s consider the basics of a simple balancing algorithm to see how it rapidly becomes  complex.  Using a round-robin algorithm is the simplest method of balancing. The round-robin just cycles  through a list of servers and sends each new request to the next server. When it reaches the end of  the list, it starts over at the beginning.  This method assumes that all requests have an equal performance cost on the server, and that each  server has identical processing power. In reality, the power of each back-end server might vary, so  you add weighting to allow some back-end servers to receive more requests than others.   This still leaves you with the problem that not all requests are equal. A request for a static resource  will be several orders of magnitude less resource-intensive than a request for a dynamic resource.  You can adjust for this by comparing the number of requests forwarded on to a server with the num- ber of responses received. If a particular server starts to build up a backlog, you can automatically  lower its weighting and forward subsequent requests on to a quieter server.   This still isn’t perfect, though, because a request taking a long time to be answered is not necessar- ily an indication of an overloaded back-end server. For example, a PHP script that generates reports  from a database might take a long time to return — but most of the load would be on the database  server, not the back-end server.   To deal with this, you need monitoring that is more sophisticated than simply watching requests  going back and forth. You need to query the back-end server to discover memory and CPU usage,  server load, and perhaps even network latency. Many load balancers do, indeed, do this, either using  Simple Network Management Protocol  SNMP , or a dedicated communications channel  for exam- ple, a daemon running on each back-end server that talks to the load balancer over a long-running  TCP connection . Even this isn’t perfect, though, because load on a back-end server can change dra- matically in a short period of time.  For example, think of a request that uses a lot of CPU but runs  only for one-tenth of a second.   Load-balancing intelligence doesn’t need to stop there. As you will soon see, sending requests from  the same client to the same back-end server each time can be useful to ensure sticky sessions  that is,  ensuring the session data is not lost . But this can defeat the purpose of trying to spread load evenly  over each back-end server. When you try to factor in both session affi nity  sticky sessions  and bal- ancing of the load, things get even more complicated.  Hashing based on an IP address ensures that, if the client has a fi xed IP address, subsequent requests  will all go to the same back-end server. This is great for session affi nity and produces a fairly even  balance across servers with a large enough sample. Unfortunately, there’ll always be a small percent- age of users behind proxy farms, whose IP addresses change from request to request. Often, it’s just  the last octet that changes, and hashing on the fi rst three octets solves this. But you can’t always  guarantee this, and you usually can’t afford to alienate these users. Conversely, some users will be  behind NAT devices, making them all appear to originate from the same IP address  the address of   c07.indd   174 c07.indd   174  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Load Balancers  ❘  175  the NAT device .This behavior is mostly seen on corporate LANs that only have one public-facing  IP address.   A solution to the problem of a client’s IP address changing between requests is cookies, of which  there are two possible options:    ➤ The load balancer sets a cookie when the client fi rst issues a request. This cookie contains  the ID of the back-end server that was assigned to handle the request. The balancer checks  for the cookie on subsequent requests from the client and routes them to the same back-end  server.    ➤ The balancer utilizes a cookie already set by the application  for example, a session ID .   Both methods rely on the client accepting cookies, of course. But with the latter option, your appli- cation probably won’t work if the client doesn’t. So, this isn’t penalizing clients any more than they  already have been. The latter method does require that the load balancer maintain a lookup table  mapping session ID to back-end server, though, and this table can grow rather large. In practice, you  must keep the table to a reasonable size by expiring entries after a certain time, and this can cause  session affi nity to be lost.  Ultimately, the best solution to session affi nity is simply not to store session data on individual back- end servers. memcache is the ideal alternative.   NOTE   You learn more about memcache in Chapter 10.  SSL Acceleration and Termination  SSL communications can cause a signifi cant amount of CPU overhead, both during the initial   handshake  when keys are exchanged  and the encryption decryption of packets sent over the   connection. This can have an impact on the performance of back-end servers, and many load   balancers offer features to take over some of the work.   NOTE   Advances in hardware over the past decade mean this is much less of a  problem than it was. See http:  www.imperialviolet.org 2010 06 25  overclocking-ssl.html for a discussion of Gmail’s experiences.  With SSL termination, the load balancer becomes one endpoint of the SSL connection, rather than  the back-end web server.  The other endpoint is the client, of course.  This relieves the back-end  servers of the overhead of managing the SSL connection. Whether this is benefi cial is debatable  because all you’ve done is to shift the processing from the back end to the load balancer. If the  load balancer runs specialist hardware, it’s probably more economical to place the extra load on  relatively inexpensive back-end servers, rather than risk causing a bottleneck on an expensive load  balancer.  c07.indd   175 c07.indd   175  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   176  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Still, there are a couple of advantages to making the load balancer the termination point. For start- ers, it means that the load balancer can inspect the contents of the HTTPS packets  because they  have been decrypted . This allows enhanced fi rewalling and means that you can balance requests  based on the contents of the packets — for example, the request URI, virtual host, the content  or  presence of  cookies, and so on. With encrypted HTTPS content, many of the advanced balancing  methods previously discussed simply aren’t possible.  Another advantage is that some hardware load balancers  in particular, the high-end ones  include  an additional processor specifi cally for SSL encryption decryption. These dedicated cryptography  processors can offer a huge boost in performance  hence, they are often referred to as SSL  accelerators , but this is refl ected in the cost — it may be cheaper just to invest in more powerful  back-end servers.  SSL acceleration isn’t just available on custom hardware, though. A number of manufacturers  produce PCI cards containing SSL processors. Using these is as simple as plugging them in and  loading the appropriate driver module into the kernel. These cards aren’t cheap, though, and,  again, there’s the suspicion that it may be just as economical to invest in a faster motherboard  CPU. Still, for a PC acting as a load balancer and SSL endpoint, these cards are certainly worth  looking into.  Security  Although security isn’t a primary concern in this book, it’s worth noting that software load bal- ancers add an additional layer of security to the network by hiding the back-end web servers from  the Internet. Because all requests to back-end servers must fi rst go past the balancer, they also pro- vide the capability to fi lter out unwanted requests  for example,  phpmyadmin ,  admin   or limit  them to authenticated users only. Load balancers can also help to protect against SYN fl oods  DoS  attacks  because they pass traffi c only on to a back-end server after a full TCP connection has been  set up with the client.  Traffi  c Shaping  One interesting possibility with a load balancer is to prioritize certain types of traffi c. You can  attempt to improve caching by hashing to ensure that the same request goes to the same back-end  server each time. With traffi c rate shaping, you could give priority treatment to certain IP blocks or  requests.   For example, you could send all requests for a reports-generating script to a particular server.  Requests may end up being queued on this server  because of the intensive, long-running nature of  the report-generating script , but end users will probably be okay with waiting longer for this kind  of request, and it stops spikes on the rest of your back-end servers.  Using Multiple Back-End Servers  One advantage of using Nginx and Apache side by side is that it paves the way for a multiserver  setup with more than one back end, and even includes its own load-balancing proxy  Nginx , as  shown in Figure 7-4.  c07.indd   176 c07.indd   176  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Client  GET logo.gif  Nginx  Load Balancers  ❘  177  Pool of Apache Servers  FIGURE 7-4  Nginx can serve the following three roles here:   ➤ Nginx acts solely as a load-balancing proxy, forwarding all requests to an Apache back end.   ➤ Nginx forwards requests for dynamic content to Apache and serves static resources.   ➤ Nginx forwards all requests to Apache  including static resources  but also acts as a cache   for static and or dynamic content.  Having Nginx forward requests for dynamic content to Apache  and serving static content  is gener- ally the most optimal. You could even combine it with elements of the third option so that FastCGI  responses are cached. You then end up with Nginx acting as a reverse proxying, load-balancing,  static fi le serving, dynamic request cache — quite a mouthful.  Nginx as a Load-Balancing Proxy  The key to load balancing with Nginx is the upstream module compiled in by default. Rather than  passing an IP:port to proxy_pass, use the upstream directive to defi ne a pool of back-end servers;  then pass the name that you’ve assigned to this pool to proxy_pass, as shown here:  upstream apachepool  {   server 192.168.0.100 weight=5;   server 192.168.0.101 weight=10;   server 192.168.0.102 weight=10; }  server {   location   {     proxy_pass  http:  apachepool;   } }  This code example creates an upstream named apachepool and assigns three servers to it.  Port  80 is assumed by default.  The fi rst server is given a lower weight to illustrate how a mixture of   hardware power can be used.  c07.indd   177 c07.indd   177  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   178  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Nginx can balance requests across these three servers using the weighting given.  If none is given,  each server is considered equal.  If a back-end server is down, Nginx moves on to the next one.   It’s usual to want more control over this process, and, as always, Nginx does not disappoint. The  server directive accepts the following additional parameters that can be used to fi ne-tune behavior:   ➤ max_fails — This is the number of times a back-end server can fail before Nginx considers  it to be “down.” By default, a timeout or connection error is considered a failure. The default  for max_fails is 1.   ➤ fail_timeout — This is the time frame for max_fails. If more than the specifi ed   max_fails occur during this time, the server is considered “down,” and Nginx moves  on to the next one. The default is 10 seconds.  When a server is marked as “down” by Nginx, how long does it stay “down”? This value is also  defi ned by fail_timeout. So, with max_fails=3 and fail_timeout=15, a server will be considered  “down” if more than 3 requests fail within the space of 15 seconds. When this happens, the server  will be temporarily removed from the pool for a further 15 seconds.  Proxy_next_upstream can be used to control exactly what it means for a server to be “down.” The  default is for just transmission errors  timeouts, errors sending requests reading responses  to trigger  a fail, but you can extend this to include specifi c HTTP status codes. In the following example, this  is specifi ed, for example, if the back-end server returns a 500 Internal Server Error:  proxy_next_upstream error timeout http_500  Nginx’s default load-balancing logic is far from perfect, though. It uses a round-robin approach, so,  if all servers have the same weight, it simply cycles through them. This approach fails to take into  account the cost of serving each request.   For example, generating a report might take 10 seconds, whereas generating the index page might  take only 0.2 second. Consider what happens with a pool of three servers if a hit on the report-  generating page is received, followed by fi ve hits on the index page:   1.  Nginx passes the report-generating page request to the fi rst server in the pool.   2.  The fi rst index page request is passed to the second server.   3.  The second index page request is passed to the third server.   4.  The fourth index page request is passed to the fi rst server again, even though it is still strug-  gling with generating the report.    5.  The fi fth index page request is passed to the second server.  Clearly, step 4 is not optimal — it’s preferable for the fi rst server to be skipped because the other  two are sitting idle. The third-party module  so you need to compile it in  upstream_fair solves  this problem. It keeps tracks of how many requests are currently served by each back-end server and  routes requests to the server with the least load.   Actually, upstream_fair uses a “weighted least-connection round-robin” algorithm. So, although  the load on each back-end server is the major factor, it also takes into account the weighting of   c07.indd   178 c07.indd   178  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Load Balancers  ❘  179  each server and uses the round-robin approach when two servers are otherwise equal. In addi- tion, upstream_fair has a number of options for specialist situations  such as the capability to  disable the round robin . The module is available from http:  nginx.localdomain.pl wiki  UpstreamFair.  It’s likely that you’ll be using some form of PHP opcode cache on each FastCGI back-end server. This  is a topic discussed in a lot more depth in Chapter 12. But if you’re unfamiliar with such caches, all  you need to know for now is that they can improve performance by providing partial caching of PHP  code. Naturally, it’s rather ineffi cient if each cache is duplicating data stored in the caches of other  FastCGI nodes, and it’s equally poor if a given FastCGI server does not have in its cache elements the  request it is currently handling while its neighbor does.   Clearly, neither of the load-balancing options examined thus far help here, but there are a couple of  possible solutions.   The upstream_fair supports an option to load balance based on a hash of the client’s IP address.   Actually, it uses the fi rst three octets from the IP, such as 192.168.5.x.  So, a client will always be  served by the same back-end server  unless the server is “down,” in which case the next available  server is used .   This isn’t a great help for effi cient opcode caching, but it can be used for session affi nity  also  known as sticky sessions  to ensure that session data  which is often stored in a fi le on the  back-end server  isn’t lost between requests.   NOTE   There are lots of other ways to deal with the problem of session affi nity,  such as storing in a database  which can be a performance bottleneck , stor- ing all client-side data in cookies  which can be insecure , or using a network   fi lesystem  for example, an NFS partition  to hold the session fi les. One favorite  is  memcache, though. You learn more about memcache in Chapter 10.  HTML5 also introduced sessionStorage and localStorage, which are   features that allow the client to store data locally. As with cookies, however,  there is the potential for the user to tamper with this data, and you should treat it  accordingly.  You can enable IP hashing like so:  upstream apachepool  {   ip_hash;   server 192.168.0.100 weight=5;   server 192.168.0.101 weight=10;   server 192.168.0.102 weight=10; }  Another solution is the third-party Upstream Hash module  ngx_http_upstream_hash_module ,  which performs hashing based on environmental variables. The possibilities here are endless. If you  hash based on the request URI, you can ensure that requests for the same dynamic content always  go to the same server, which is the most effi cient in terms of utilizing opcode caches.   c07.indd   179 c07.indd   179  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   180  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  upstream apachepool  {   hash $request_uri;   server 192.168.0.100;   server 192.168.0.101;   server 192.168.0.102; }  NOTE   You can’t use weighting when using Upstream Hash.  You can even hash a combination of the request URI and client IP address to ensure a high hit rate  on your opcode caches while preserving session affi nity, as shown here:      hash $request_uri$http_remote_addr;  Just how useful is balancing based on a URL, though? It certainly increases the effi ciency of your  PHP opcode caches, but this may offer only a minor performance gain, and you lose out on the  capability to distribute requests based on the load on each back-end server. Session affi nity is prob- ably an issue that can be left out of the equation for the moment because there are better solutions   for example, storing session data globally in memcache . Ultimately, you should be aware of both  possibilities, but balancing based on load is probably the superior solution overall.  Nginx as a Load Balancer and Static File Server  An improvement on this model is to have Nginx handle static fi les, taking weight off the back-end  servers  which are more suited for handling dynamic content than serving static fi les . Adding this is  simple. You just defi ne a location before your location   catch-all, as shown here:  location ~ ^  imagesjavascriptjscssmediastatic   {     root  var www html ;     expires 30d; } location   {     proxy_pass  http:  apachepool; }  Nginx as a Load Balancer and Cache  A third option is to let Apache continue to serve static resources but implement caching of them in  Nginx to reduce  or even eliminate  the need to bother Apache. The end result isn’t much different  from the previously discussed model  Nginx as a load balancer and static fi le server , but it may be  more appropriate in certain situations. Most of the time, though, having the static resources on a  centralized server  the Nginx load balancer  rather than distributed across each back-end server is  the more sensible solution.  Nginx as a Load Balancer, Static File Server, and Dynamic Content Cache  With this fi nal option, Nginx serves static fi les locally and load balances requests for dynamic content  across a pool of back-end servers. But it also caches the  dynamic  responses from the back-end servers,  further cutting down on traffi c to them. The caching of FastCGI has been previously discussed.  c07.indd   180 c07.indd   180  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Load Balancers  ❘  181  Eliminating Apache  The topologies examined thus far have clung on to Apache as a back-end server for dynamic content.  But as you’ve already seen, Nginx plus FastCGI can be just as good of a replacement — and when it  comes to multiserver setups, it can even be a better option because FastCGI can load balance across  multiple back-end servers.  Figure 7-5 shows a simple layout in which a single Nginx server handles dynamic content via  FastCGI, balancing the load across a pool of FastCGI back-end servers.  Client  GET foo.php  Nginx  Pool of FastCGI Servers  FIGURE 7-5  You’ve already seen how to use FastCGI for handling dynamic content. Implementing load balancing  into this is actually rather simple. You use the upstream module, as shown here:  upstream phppool  {   server 192.168.0.100:9000 weight=5;   server 192.168.0.101:9000 weight=10;   server 192.168.0.102:9000 weight=10; }  location ~ \.php$ {   include  etc nginx fcgi_params.conf;   fastcgi_pass  phppool; }  Now, you just need to ensure that your FastCGI daemon is listening on the appropriate interface and  port on each host. As before, you can use weighting, max_fails, fail_timeout, and proxy_next_ upstream to control how load is spread across these back-end servers, and what happens when a  node goes down.  HAProxy  Nginx already seems to work quite well as a load balancer  and optionally a cache, too , but there  are plenty of alternatives. One of the most popular is HAProxy, a fast balancer that also implements  high-availability features. Although HAProxy does not offer caching, benchmarks usually show it to   c07.indd   181 c07.indd   181  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   182  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  be a little faster than Nginx  in terms of the number of connections per second it can handle , and it  has a wealth of extra features. Let’s take a look at HAProxy confi guration options before looking at  topologies involving HAProxy and Nginx.  NOTE   HAProxy is known to run on Linux  this being the favored , Solaris,  FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, but other platforms are not supported.  Conﬁ guration  The HAProxy confi guration  usually  etc haproxy haproxy.cfg  fi le generally consists of three  sections:    ➤ global — This is where global parameters  mostly relating to HAProxy  are defi ned.   ➤ defaults — This contains options specifi c to the proxying method  for example,    ➤ listen — This is a block defi ning the interface ports on which to listen and the back-end    connection timeouts .   servers to proxy to.   You can dispense with the defaults block and place its directives directly inside a listen block,  and you can write the listen blocks in a more verbose form. But the three-section approach is   preferred. A simple confi guration fi le might be as brief as the following:      global         daemon         maxconn 256      defaults         mode http         timeout connect 5000ms      listen mybackends         bind *:80         server server1 192.0.0.101:80 maxconn 16         server server2 192.0.0.102:80 maxconn 16  This tells HAProxy to run as a daemon allowing a maximum of 256 connections. The defaults  section defi nes the protocol as HTTP  HAProxy can be used to balance many protocols , and a   connection timeout of 5 seconds. Finally, this instructs the proxy to listen on port 80 TCP on all  interfaces and to load balance across two back-end servers  192.168.0.101 and 192.168.0.102 . Let’s  take a more detailed look at the global confi guration options.  NOTE   Incidentally, most of the work carried out by HAProxy goes on in kernel  space, rather than user space.  By its author’s observations, approximately 95  percent of the time is spent in the kernel.  As such, tuning the operating system  kernel has a much greater impact on performance than application-level settings.  c07.indd   182 c07.indd   182  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Load Balancers  ❘  183  Global  The global section contains the majority of the performance-related options for HAProxy. But  remember that it runs on many platforms, and some of these options  for example, event polling  on BSD systems  may not be relevant. You can fi nd a full list of options in the documentation at  http:  haproxy.1wt.eu download 1.4 doc configuration.txt.   NOTE   Speaking of event polling, on Linux, HAProxy defaults to speculative  event polling, and there isn’t usually a good reason to stray from this default.  One potential gotcha is the nbproc option, which controls how many processes to spawn. It’s tempt- ing to see this as analogous to worker_processes for Nginx, and set it to equal the number of CPU  cores on the system. This isn’t recommended, though.   As you’ve already seen, the vast majority of the processing carried out by HAProxy is at the kernel  level — and the kernel is multithreaded, so it makes good use of multiple cores. Increasing the num- ber of userland processes isn’t going to help here. If anything, performance will be reduced because  there is now the additional overhead of the worker processes communicating with each other over  shared memory.   nbproc was introduced to only work around limits on the number of fi le descriptors an individual  process could create on some operating systems. This isn’t  or at least, doesn’t have to be  an issue  on Linux. Thus, nbcproc can be left to the default of 1.  TCP splicing is a relatively new feature of the Linux kernel, which can reduce CPU overhead on   systems that are acting as a proxy. Some versions of the 2.6 kernel have bugs in their implementa- tion, though, and HAProxy offers the capability to disable splicing via the nosplice option. Buggy  splicing can be diffi cult to diagnose, so unless you are sure that the kernel you are running is not  affected  or cannot afford to sacrifi ce the reduction in CPU usage , or are not using Linux, it’s   probably safest to turn splicing off.   maxconn sets the maximum number of concurrent connections that HAProxy will accept.  You can afford to set this relatively high because HAProxy can queue connections to the back-end  servers — this is governed by the maxconn setting in the listen section s .  The remaining global performance options all take the form tune.xxx   and shouldn’t  need changing from their defaults. In brief, they are as follows:   ➤ tune.bufsize — This is the per-request buffer size. Lowering this value will allow more  sessions to co-exist in memory but will break requests with large amounts of data in the  HTTP header.   ➤ tune.chksize — This is the size of the buffer to use when performing string matching on   HTTP headers. Setting this too low may cause matches to be missed; setting it too high  wastes memory. It’s best for performance not to be in the situation of needing to parse  potentially large HTTP headers anyway.  c07.indd   183 c07.indd   183  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   184  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS   ➤ tune.maxaccept — This option is mostly for use in multiprocess mode  that is, when   nbproc is greater than 1  to ensure a fair distribution of requests across each process. It sets  the maximum number of requests that a single process will accept in one batch.   ➤ tune.maxpollevents — This controls the number of events that will be processed in each   call to the polling system. The HAProxy documentation notes that lowering this value tends  to cause a small reduction in latency  at the expense of extra bandwidth , whereas increas- ing it has the opposite effect. Either way, this option is usually set automatically, and there  shouldn’t be a need to change it.   ➤ tune.maxrewrite — Related to bufsize, this is the size of the buffer used when rewriting   headers  for example, inserting cookies . If this value is too low, any particularly large request  won’t fi t fully. If it is too high, you waste memory. The suggested starting point is 1024.   ➤ tune.rcvbuf.client, tune.rcvbuf.server, tune.sndbuf.client, and tune  .sndbuf.server — These fi nal four options tune the kernel socket buffer size for sending  and receiving on both the client and server sides. Normally, these will be set automatically  by HAProxy, based on the amount of system memory. But it can occasionally be useful to  lower these to save memory  at the expense of an increase in CPU usage .  NOTE   Unless you are absolutely sure that there is a need to change any of these  values, it is strongly recommended to leave them alone.  defaults  Whereas the global section lets you confi gure global options for HAProxy, the defaults section  specifi cally deals with options for the chosen proxy mode. Because you’re dealing only with HTTP,  this distinction may seem unimportant. But it makes perfect sense if HAProxy is used as a load bal- ancer for several protocols at once.  Currently, three proxy modes are supported: tcp, http, and health. The latter is for performing  health checks on servers, so let’s concentrate on the fi rst two for the moment.   With tcp mode, HAProxy operates at the TCP level  OSI Layer 4 — see Chapter 1 for an overview  of the OSI model  only. It forwards traffi c between client and server without caring  or even under- standing  the higher-level HTTP protocol. This offers the lowest latency but is the least fl exible  because it cannot balance based on HTTP content.  In http mode, HAProxy acts on OSI Layer 4  TCP  and Layer 7  HTTP . This gives HAProxy the power  to inspect and rewrite HTTP packets, allowing for more advanced load balancing. But it also means  more work, so there is an increase in latency, as well as CPU and memory usage. Usually, these overheads  aren’t signifi cant, and the advantages of having a Layer 7-aware proxy more than make up for them.   Timeouts The default section is also the home for setting the various timeout options. All these options  accept a numeric value and can optionally include a units suffi x  for example, 10s . If no units are  given, milliseconds are assumed. Following are the timeout options:  c07.indd   184 c07.indd   184  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Load Balancers  ❘  185   ➤ timeout check — When performing health checks on servers, this option determines how   long HAProxy should wait until it decides a back-end server is timing out. Health checks  should be a lot faster to run than normal HTTP queries, so you can set this quite low,  unless the back-end servers are on a high-latency link.   ➤ timeout client — This is the timeout period when communicating with clients.   ➤ timeout connect — This is the timeout when HAProxy is attempting to establish a con-  nection to a back-end server. Although you’d usually expect back-end servers on a local area  network  LAN  to respond within, say, 100 milliseconds, it’s advisable to set this option to  a few seconds to accommodate the occasional dropped packet or server spike. The default  is no timeout, but this should be avoided because it has the potential to cause a buildup of  half-open connections.   ➤ timeout http-keep-alive — When the back-end servers use Keep Alive, HAProxy must   keep the connection open following the fi rst request and response, in case the client wants  to send further requests. This option defi nes for how long the connection will be allowed to  remain open without the client issuing any requests. If unset, the timeout http-request is  used.   ➤ timeout http-request — It’s often quite easy to perform denial-of-service  DoS  attacks  on heavy web servers like Apache by opening hundreds of connections, but not sending any  data  or sending data at a slow rate — say, one character per minute . This option requires  that the HTTP request headers have been fully sent by the client within this period of time.  It doesn’t apply to the request body, unfortunately, because POST data could potentially take  much longer to send. Generally, a value of a few seconds is best, and if not set, the value of  timeout client will be used.   ➤ timeout queue — HAProxy can be confi gured to limit the maximum number of con-  current requests it sends to a back-end server  to avoid overloading it . When this limit is  reached, requests are queued in HAProxy, and this option defi nes how long an item may  remain in the queue before HAProxy throws a 503 Service Unavailable error. If no  value is set, timeout connect is used.   ➤ timeout server — Whereas timeout client deals with timeouts when communicating   with the clients, this option governs the timeout period when waiting for a back-end server to  acknowledge a request or send a response. Obviously, the time taken for the back-end server  to process the request is the major delay here, so this value should be set suffi ciently large.  Cookies and Session Affi  nity As mentioned earlier, cookies can be used to ensure session affi nity, and  unlike IP address hashing   these work even if the client is behind a proxy farm that causes the IP address to change from one  request to the next.  In HAProxy, the appsession option can be used to set session affi nity based on the presence of a  particular cookie  for example, PHPSESSID . When HAProxy sees a server set the cookie, it stores  the cookie’s contents and the server ID in a lookup table. If HAProxy subsequently sees a client  issue a request with the cookie in the headers, it checks the lookup table and directs the request to  the appropriate server.   c07.indd   185 c07.indd   185  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   186  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  The full syntax for appsession is as follows:  appsession   len   timeout   [request-learn]  Following are the options used:   ➤ Len is the number of characters  starting at the beginning  of the cookie to store in the   lookup table. Using this option helps to keep the size of the table down but is only practical  if the cookie can be uniquely identifi ed by these characters.   ➤ The timeout value specifi es how long before unused cookie entries are removed from the   table, again helping to reduce memory usage.   ➤ When request-learn is set, HAProxy attempts to learn client-server associations if it   spots the cookie in a client request, but does not have an entry for it in the lookup table.  This improves reliability in situations in which the cookie entry has been expired from the  lookup table.  Although this sticky behavior is desirable for requests for dynamic content, it’s usually unneces- sary if the client is requesting a static resource. But the cookie would usually be sent with these  static requests as well  unless the cookie path or domain had been carefully set to exclude them ,  and, hence, they would all go to the same back-end server. To stop such behavior, HAPRoxy offers  the ignore_persist option, which enables the cookie to be ignored in certain user-defi ned situa- tions — for example on requests for fi les in a particular directory or with a particular extension.  Access Control Lists These user-defi ned situations are implemented as Access Control Lists  ACLs , and a thorough  examination could easily fi ll the next dozen pages exploring the intricacies of HAProxy’s implemen- tation of them. Briefl y, though, you would defi ne an ACL using the acl keyword, like so:  acl static_resources path_end .gif .png .jpg .css .js .ico .txt  It should be apparent that this defi nes an ACL named static_resources, which applies when the  path of the request ends in any of the extensions listed. You can subsequently use this ACL with  ignore-persist, as shown here:  Ignore-persist if static_resources  This only scrapes the surface of what is possible with ACLs, though. For example, you could bal- ance dynamic requests across a pool of heavy back-end servers such as Apache plus mod_xxx, while  static requests are sent to a lightweight Nginx instance. The HAProxy documentation contains  more information, along with plenty of useful examples.  Connection Handling and Keep Alive Another signifi cant part of the HAProxy defaults confi guration is the handling of connections,  particularly for Keep Alive. You can use these options to override the behavior of back-end web  servers and correct bad protocol implementations. Hopefully, you won’t need any of these, but in  brief they are as follows:  c07.indd   186 c07.indd   186  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Load Balancers  ❘  187   ➤ option httpclose — This adds a 'Connection: close' header to the request and   response, if one does not already exist. This effectively prevents Keep Alive, even if the  back-end servers support it.   ➤ option forceclose — This closes the connection as soon as the server has responded.   This is a faster  but less graceful  way to close the connection than option httpclose, and,  naturally, it also prevents the use of Keep Alive.   ➤ option http-pretend-keepalive — If either of the previous two options are set,  HAProxy ends up adding a 'Connection: close' header to the request sent to the  back-end server. With some web servers, this causes them not to use chunked encoding in  responses. With http-pretend-keepalive, the server will think that a persistent connec- tion is used, eliminating this behavior.  listen  Let’s now take a look at the heart of the confi guration — the listen section — the part that speci- fi es your back-end servers and how to balance across them. An example shows that the syntax isn’t a  million miles away from that of Nginx, and is easy to pick up.  Let’s start by defi ning the IP s  and port s  on which the proxy should listen:  bind 192.168.0.10:80  The balance keyword is used to specify the load-balancing method to use; although, this applies  only to nonpersistent connections — session affi nity takes precedence where applicable. Currently,  the following balancing methods are available:   ➤ static-rr — This uses a weighted round-robin approach — something you’ve already   learned about in detail.   ➤ roundrobin — This offers an improvement over static round-robin in that weightings are  dynamic and can be adjusted in real time by HAProxy. One use for this is so-called slow  starts, in which a server that had previously been marked as offl ine is brought back slowly  into the pool, rather than bombarding it with connections when it comes back online. This  method uses slightly more CPU than the static-rr method.   ➤ leastconn — Here, HAProxy balances based on the number of existing connections to   each back-end server and falls back to a round-robin if several servers have the same number  of connections. Because the HTTP requests are generally short-lived, the number of connec- tions to a back-end server can vary dramatically in a short period of time. As such, this isn’t  a good balancing method for web traffi c; although it is excellent for long-running requests  such as a POP3 session.   ➤ source — This uses hashing of the client’s IP address, resulting in stickiness — a given cli- ent will always be directed to the same back-end server provided the number of back-end  servers remains the same. Cookies are usually a better way to achieve session affi nity, but  this method can be used if HAProxy runs in TCP mode  rather than HTTP mode  or, for  other reasons such as to stop cookies from being used  for example, when clients refuse  cookies .  c07.indd   187 c07.indd   187  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   188  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS   ➤ uri — This balances based on the request URI  excluding any query string . As previously   discussed, this improves cache hits and effi ciency  if caching is used  because requests for the  same resource always go to the same back-end server. But it doesn’t give a particularly even  spread of requests across the back-end servers.   ➤ url_param — Similar to the uri method, this time HAProxy searches the query string for  a particular parameter  hashes  and balances on this. This can be used for session affi nity  in situations in which a unique identifi er is passed from page to page in the query string.   Although it can also be set to search POST data.    ➤ hdr name  — This method balances based on the content of the header given  or falls back   on round-robin if the header is not present . This is more of a specialist method, but possible  uses would be for balancing based on vhost, the client’s country of origin, or even if the   client supports Keep Alive or gzip compression.   ➤ rdp-cookie — Remote Desktop Protocol  RDP  is used for ensuring that RDP sessions are  correctly routed to the back-end servers when HAProxy runs in TCP mode, which is not a  concern for this discussion.  Following are a few examples:  balance static round-robin balance url_param uid balance hdr Accept-Encoding  gzip  It’s interesting to note that cookie-based balancing doesn’t appear in this list. In fact, you enable this  separately  if wanted , using the cookie option. You still set a balance method, though, which will  be used if the cookie isn’t present.  Aside from the name of the cookie to use, you must also tell HAProxy whether it will be using an  existing cookie  that is, one generated by the web application , or adding a cookie of its own by  using either rewrite  using existing cookie  or insert  add cookie . In most situations, it is prefer- able to insert a cookie to cause minimal interference to the web application, as shown here:  cookie SERVERID insert  This is closely related  but not identical  to the appsession option discussed earlier. With  appsession, HAProxy maps cookie to the back-end server using an internal lookup table.  With cookie, HAProxy actually creates or modifi es cookies.  Finally, your list of back-end servers is specifi ed as a name followed by an address port, and optional  additional arguments. Thus, your whole listen block can be as simple as this:  bind 192.168.0.10:80 balance round-robin server server1 192.168.0.100:80 server server2 192.168.0.101:80 server server3 192.168.0.102:80  c07.indd   188 c07.indd   188  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Load Balancers  ❘  189  This balances across three back-end servers using the round-robin method.  The real fun comes with the extra options available because these enable you to set up weighting, con- nection queuing, health-checking, and slow starts. Let’s take a look at the most interesting options.  weight   This option takes an integer value between zero and 256 specifying the relative weight of the server.  Following is an example:  server server1 192.168.0.100:80 weight 50 server server2 192.168.0.101:80 weight 50 server server3 192.168.0.102:80 weight 100  In this situation, server3 should receive approximately one-half of the total traffi c, and server1  and server2 approximately one-quarter each.  maxconn   This defi nes the maximum number of concurrent connections that HAProxy allows the server to  receive. Any further connections to this server will be queued. This can be useful to prevent a server  from being overloaded with connections; although MaxClients  or equivalent  should already  have been prudently set on the server to prevent overloading. Still, you can use this option as an  additional safety check, or for some non-HTTP services that may not offer the capability to limit  concurrency.   maxqueue   If maxconn is reached, connections will be queued, and this option defi nes the maximum size of the  queue. The default is zero  unlimited , but there is a case for setting it to a fi nite value. If the queue  fi lls up, requests will be sent to another server in the pool, and although this will break any session  affi nity, it will probably offer the best response time for the client.   It’s worth thinking about situations in which maxconn and maxqueue might be high when deciding  on suitable values. If the server pool is under high load, in general, it’s inevitable that connection  queuing needs to take place, and you need to set the queue high enough that clients won’t be turned  away too quickly.   However, if queuing starts to happen on an individual server, it could be that the server is locked in  a downward spiral.  Perhaps the requests that it handles are particularly intensive, or an unrelated  process is hogging resources.  In this case, there’s a good chance that queued requests will never be  processed. Hence, it may be better to keep the queue small, forcing the requests to go to other serv- ers. You’ll lose your session affi nity, but at least the request will get a response.   NOTE   HAProxy can still take servers out of the pool if they are completely  unresponsive. This is just to guard against situations in which a server enters into  a downward spiral.  c07.indd   189 c07.indd   189  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   190  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  check At its most basic level, health checking consists of HAProxy attempting to establish a TCP connec- tion to a back-end server on the IP address and port that it is balanced to. Thus, on web servers, the  check would  probably  be on TCP 80, as shown here:  server server1 192.168.0.100:80 weight 50 check  Checking is set on a per-server basis, giving you the option to disable it on certain back-end servers  if necessary.  Of course, simply attempting to create a TCP connection to the back-end service is no guarantee  that things are running perfectly, and HAProxy offers enhanced checking for a number of protocols:  HTTP, SMTP, MySQL, and SSL. The syntax is as follows:  option httpchk  option httpchk   option httpchk      The default is to send an OPTIONS request, which is low on overhead and should be a good indication  of the web server’s sanity. HAProxy treats a 2xx or 3xx response as success, and anything else as a fail.   inter The time period between health checks is governed by the inter parameter to server, and defaults  to 2,000 milliseconds. To not fl ood the network with packets, checks are automatically staggered  a little. But you can increase this further  if wanted  using spread-checks. This global parameter  takes a percentage value between 0 and 50 that specifi es the degree of randomness in the checking  time. Thus, with a check interval of 2,000 milliseconds on a server and a spread-checks value  of 10 percent, health checks would take place at intervals between 1,800 and 2,200 milliseconds.  Following is an example:  spread-checks 20 server server1 192.168.0.100:80 weight 50 check inter 2000  fall   By default, a health check must fail three times in a row before HAProxy fl ags the server as “down,”  but this can be overridden using the fall option, as shown here:  server server1 192.168.0.100:80 weight 50 check inter 2000 fall 5  Be wary of setting this too low. Taking a server out of the pool puts additional strain on the remain- ing machines, which, in turn, could cause them to fail. So, you must avoid being too trigger-happy  here. Certainly, a value of 1 would introduce the possibility of too many false positives.   c07.indd   190 c07.indd   190  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   Summary  ❘  191  rise   Even when a server has been marked as “down,” HAProxy still sends health checks, and this option  defi nes how many consecutive successful checks are needed for the server to be deemed “alive”  again. The default is 2.  slowstart   When HAProxy does detect that a back-end server has come back to life, it can be advantageous  not to immediately start bombarding it with connections. For web servers like Apache, a gradual  increase in the number of requests gives time for additional processes to be forked without causing  spikes in CPU and disk I O. Even for web servers that don’t operate on a process-per-request model,  slow starts can be used if there’s a danger of the server immediately falling down as soon as it has  come back up.  This option takes a time period  by default, in milliseconds  during which the weight of the back- end server will move from 0 percent to 100 percent of its confi gured value. In addition, maxconn  moves from 0 percent to 100 percent during this time, too.   In most situations, slowstart isn’t essential; although a smallish value  say a couple of seconds  can  reduce latency in handling requests if the back-end server must spawn new children to handle each  request. Following is an example:  server server1 192.168.0.100:80 weight 50 check inter 2000 slowstart 2000  observe   As an alternative to proactively sending out health checks, HAProxy can assess server health by  monitoring the traffi c already fl owing from the server. For example, if a back-end server starts gen- erating 5xx error codes in response to client requests, HAPRoxy can spot this and act on it.  Two observation modes are support: layer4 and layer7. In layer4 mode, HAProxy simply looks  at the TCP packet level — are TCP connections to the back-end failing? In layer7 mode, HAProxy  has the power to analyze HTTP responses and detect HTTP error codes, too.  There are dangers to relying on passive health checking. For example, an HTTP error code may  not mean the whole server is “down.” It may even be down because of a badly behaved client. As a  result, you should use dedicated health checking, but if you’d like to try passive checking, there are  more details in the HAProxy documentation.  SUMMARY  Although Apache is a great multipurpose web server, it doesn’t cope well with high levels of concur- rency, especially when the prefork MPM is used. Nginx provides an excellent high-performance  alternative, and although using PHP with Nginx is a little trickier, the end result is a more powerful  and fl exible setup. When you have outgrown a single-server setup, Nginx makes it easy to balance  traffi c across multiple back-end servers.   c07.indd   191 c07.indd   191  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   192  ❘  CHAPTER 7  WORKING WITH WEB SERVERS  Despite that, HAProxy has the edge over Nginx when it comes to load balancing. It offers health  monitoring of the back-end servers and provides greater control over how traffi c is balanced across  them. Using HAProxy as a load balancer with several Nginx and FastCGI back-end servers results  in a powerful and robust setup.  Web servers are naturally at the heart of a website’s back-end setup, but database systems also play  a highly important part in many infrastructures. MySQL is one of the most popular database solu- tions in the open source world, and will be covered in detail over the next two chapters. In Chapter  9, you discover the intricacies of MySQL replication and load balancing. But before that, let’s see  how single-server MySQL setups can be tuned for blistering performance, which is the focus of the   discussion in Chapter 8.  c07.indd   192 c07.indd   192  05 11 12   4:49 PM 05 11 12   4:49 PM   8  Tuning MySQL  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Getting to know the myriad of performance tuning options available    ➤ Writing effi  cient SQL queries, and spotting bottlenecks in existing   in MySQL  queries   ➤ Getting the most out of the MySQL query cache   ➤ Discovering the latest advances in MyISAM and InnoDB  As a relative newcomer on the scene  with the fi rst release in 1995 , MySQL has quickly  become the de facto relational database management system  RDBMS  for Linux, and one  of the most popular for Windows and UNIX. Despite lacking some of the more advanced  features found in other RDBMSs  this is gradually changing, but things like stored   procedures and transactions are still relatively new additions , MySQL is lightweight,  and has a good reputation for speed, making it an excellent choice for general-purpose  web development.  Despite this reputation for speed, there is typically still a huge scope for optimization, both in  the confi guration of the MySQL server, and in queries themselves. This chapter familiarizes  you with the performance aspects of MySQL.   This chapter begins by examining how the main storage engines differ, and the impact that  this has on performance. After looking at general MySQL tuning issues, this chapter discusses  tuning of the two most popular engines: MyISAM and InnoDB. After a discussion of MySQL’s  query caching capabilities, this chapter concludes with tips on how to write more effi cient  SQL queries, and how to debug slow-running queries.  c08.indd   193 c08.indd   193  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   194  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  NOTE   The terms cache and buffer, and index and key are often used   interchangeably throughout the MySQL community. Thus, index buffer means  the same as index cache, key cache, or key buffer. The discussions in this book  also use the terms interchangeably — partly for variety, and partly because they  refl ect real-world usage.  LOOKING INSIDE MYSQL  MySQL’s internal structure can be divided into several logical sections, and, in most cases, each of  them can be tuned. Figure 8-1 shows the major components of MySQL.   Query Cache  Client Request  Connection Handling  Parser  Optimizer  Execution  Storage Engines   MyISAM, InnoDB, and such   FIGURE 8-1  At the core is the parser, whose job it is to parse the SQL statement issued by the client, and check  the syntax. At this point, the parser may pass the query to the query cache in an attempt to fi nd an  already cached response to the query, or send it straight to the optimizer. The optimizer decides on  the best  most effi cient  way to execute the query and then passes it to the execution engine. Before  a request gets this far, though, the connection handling layer deals with matters such as authentica- tion and threading.  c08.indd   194 c08.indd   194  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Understanding the Storage Engines  ❘  195  Storage engines are a separate logical entity and are modular in nature. The rest of the internal  structure of MySQL doesn’t need to know the internal details of how the storage engines store the  data, only a set of standard methods for interacting with them. As a result, storage engines can  be radically different in how they manage things like the physical storage of data, indexing, and  locking.  Most tuning is performed through the MySQL confi guration fi le, my.cnf, which usually resides in   etc or  etc mysql  on Linux and UNIX. Unfortunately, MySQL doesn’t have a reload option,  so if any changes are made in my.cnf, you must perform a restart to force MySQL to re-read the  confi guration.  NOTE   Many MySQL init scripts offer a reload option, which, in turn, runs  mysqladmin reload. However, this reloads only the grants table. Be sure to  perform a full stop and start after making changes to my.cnf.  As an alternative, global variables  those appearing in my.cnf  can also be set at the MySQL   command-line interface  CLI  by users with privileged rights. The syntax is as follows:  SET variable-name=value;  Global variables set in this way are reset  to the values in my.cnf  upon a server restart, so permanent  changes should go in the confi guration fi le. However, as a means to make a quick change without  having to restart MySQL, global variables used in this manner are ideal.  UNDERSTANDING THE STORAGE ENGINES  As previously mentioned, the storage engine is a distinct part of MySQL, and you are free to use  any one of a number of built-in engines  or even write your own! . Some are general-purpose  engines, whereas others are designed for a specifi c purpose. Each engine has its own strengths  and weaknesses. This section looks at performance aspects associated with the two main engines   MyISAM and InnoDB , and covers some of the less common engines that are of particular interest  when considering performance.  MyISAM  Up until MySQL version 5.5, MyISAM was the default engine and is probably still the most widely  used. Conventional wisdom has it that MyISAM is faster  whatever you choose that to mean  than its  main rival, InnoDB, but this isn’t always the case. MyISAM does have a reputation for speed, however,  particularly with SELECT queriesl  The main disadvantage of MyISAM from a performance point of view is that it uses table-level  locking for write queries. That is, if a DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE query is being executed, the  whole table is locked for the duration of the query. During this time, all other queries on the table   including SELECTs  must wait.   c08.indd   195 c08.indd   195  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   196  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  This can be a particular problem on interactive sites such as forums or social networking where  there is a higher ratio of writing to reading.  The traditional maxim was that databases used for  websites spend approximately 90 percent of their time handling read queries, and 10 percent  handling write queries. But, as the web has become more interactive, this gap has lessened a little,  and it can vary a lot from site to site. . As you’ll see later in this chapter in the section, “Tuning  MyISAM,” this problem can be mitigated by using concurrent inserts, a MyISAM feature that allows  INSERT queries to run without blocking SELECT queries.  Although it’s obvious that slow-running write queries can cause problems when table-level locking  is in force, slow-running SELECT statements can also affect performance because any write queries  need to wait for these to fi nish before they can acquire a write lock.  The MyISAM engine also enables tables to be packed using the myisampack tool. Packed tables are  compressed on a row-by-row basis and are typically half the size of uncompressed MyISAM tables.  This makes accessing data a little faster  even when the cost of uncompressing is factored in because  there is less data to be read from disk , but such tables are read-only, which limits their usefulness  somewhat. Still, if you have a table with data that is rarely changed, the performance gain from  packing it may make up for the manual intervention involved in unpacking, updating, repacking,  and re-indexing.  Another popular reason for using MyISAM is its support for full-text searching —  a feature not  offered by any of the other stock storage engines. As you’ll see in the next chapter, however, full-text  searches can cause a signifi cant performance hit, and busy sites tend to opt for alternative solutions.  InnoDB  InnoDB’s support for transactions is often the main reason why developers move away from MyISAM   which has no support for them . But for a long time, it suffered a reputation for being slower than  MyISAM  a reputation that was not always deserved  and was generally thought of as something of a  specialist engine.  THE CONCEPT OF TRANSACTIONS  Transactions are a database concept in which several queries can be run atomi- cally — that is, either they all run or none run. This is vital in some situations, the  most commonly cited example being banking. Imagine transferring money from one  user’s account to another. This might consist of the following two queries:  UPDATE user1 SET balance=balance-100 UPDATE user2 SET balance=balance+100  It simply isn’t acceptable for the second query to fail  perhaps because the server  crashes, or the disk becomes full . Transactions guard against this by keeping a log  of all actions performed, and rolling back if the entire transaction does not complete  successfully.  c08.indd   196 c08.indd   196  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Understanding the Storage Engines  ❘  197  In the last few years, things have changed. Although development of MyISAM has slowed down, there  has been a lot of focus on InnoDB. Oracle’s decision to make InnoDB the default engine in MySQL  version 5.5 onward sent a clear signal that it is now the favored engine.  A lot has happened over the past few years. Performance issues that had dogged InnoDB on   multicore machines have been resolved, support for compressed tables has been added  through  the addition of a new fi le format , and a whole host of additional tuning options have been added.  InnoDB is rapidly making MyISAM seem rather primitive. If you’ve looked at InnoDB in the past and  discounted it, now might be the time to re-evaluate it.  Despite its reputation for being slower on lookups than MyISAM, InnoDB has always offered   particularly fast lookups on primary keys. The situation with secondary keys is more complicated  and is a subject that will be addressed later in this chapter in the section, “Tuning InnoDB.” But by  no means is it an inevitable performance killer.  InnoDB also offers signifi cant advantages over MyISAM when it comes to locking. Whereas MyISAM  must lock a whole table when issuing an UPDATE or DELETE query, InnoDB implements row-level  locking. On write-heavy tables, this alone can be enough reason to use InnoDB.  Finally, it should be noted that, although InnoDB offers a lot of features, it lacks full-text support.  If you require this, you’ll either have to stick with MyISAM, or implement search routines outside of  MySQL.  MEMORY  The MEMORY engine  also sometimes referred to by its earlier name, HEAP  is unique in that it  stores  the entire table in memory. This makes for fast access. Like MyISAM, it lacks support for transactions,  foreign keys, and row-level locking. There are also a number of specifi c drawbacks that limit it from  general use.  The contents of MEMORY tables do not persist across server restarts, meaning that they are only useful  for holding temporary data.  Session data is the classic example.  There is also a limitation on col- umn types, with neither blob nor text columns allowed.  The indexing method can also be problematic in some situations. The MEMORY engine supports both  B-tree and hash indexes, with the latter being the default. B-trees are generally quite a bit slower  than hashes, but in situations in which there are many duplicate index values, performance of hash  indexes can  not will  deteriorate rapidly, and B-trees can be a better option.  The maximum size of MEMORY tables is limited by the max_heap_table_size variable, which  defaults to 16 MB.  Finally, the MEMORY engine uses fi xed-size rows, with the memory allocated for each row being   determined by the size of the largest row. This is somewhat ineffi cient, and can result in a lot of  wasted memory.  c08.indd   197 c08.indd   197  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   198  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  B-TREES AND HASH INDEXES  The MEMORY engine is the only major storage engine to offer the choice of B-tree or  hashing for indexes — MyISAM and InnoDB both use B-tree only. So, which is better?  B-trees are particularly suited for large indexes where it is impractical to keep the  entire structure in memory. They take into account that the majority of the tree  will be held in secondary storage  that is, a hard disk , and they are designed to  minimize the number of disk reads required. Because of their tree structure, B-trees  make it easy to perform range searches  for example, =>, =<, BETWEEN  and prefi x  matching  for example, LIKE 'foo%' .  Hash indexes are less fl exible but are also much faster. Rather than traversing a  tree structure, MySQL can go directly to the value in the table. The table structure  also means that range searches aren’t particularly effi cient. With a B-tree, a whole  branch may be returned, whereas with hash tables, the whole table must be scanned.  So, B-trees are usually a better choice for large indexes  which won’t fi t fully into  RAM . Hash tables are faster but only for smaller indexes  they don’t scale as well  as B-tree , and only when performing equality tests.  ARCHIVE  In many ways, the ARCHIVE engine is similar to packed MyISAM tables, although it does support  INSERTs. Both use compression to save disk space and speed up reading, and both are read-only.  ARCHIVE uses zlib, and generally offers slightly better compression that packed MyISAM. However,  ARCHIVE doesn’t support indexing. Locking occurs at the row-level  like InnoDB , thus improving  concurrency.  TUNING MYSQL  Table Cache  Having looked at various aspects of the MySQL internal structure, let’s now concentrate on perfor- mance tuning. MySQL provides a whole host of confi guration options that can impact performance.  Some are specifi c to individual storage engines, whereas others affect MySQL as a whole. Let’s start  with the latter.  The table cache is perhaps the single most important aspect of nonengine-specifi c tuning but is a  little more complicated than some of the other caches buffers. Also, some minor improvements and  changes to variable names were introduced in MySQL version 5.5, so be careful of online documen- tation written for earlier versions of the software.  The table cache improves performance by holding open tables  that is, tables that are being read  written by a MySQL process via a fi le handle  in memory, eliminating the overhead involved in   c08.indd   198 c08.indd   198  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning MySQL  ❘  199  opening them.  This also involves a write because the table header must be modifi ed each time the  table is opened. The header of the table contains a counter that keeps track of how many open fi le  handles there are for the table.  Generally, it’s a good idea to strive for all tables being held in  the cache, but in some situations, this is not possible.  If the cache becomes full, and a client attempts to access a table not in the cache, a Least Recently  Used  LRU  algorithm is used to remove  that is, close and write back to disk  an old cache entry.  Running FLUSH TABLES causes all tables in the cache to be removed.  table_open_cache  The primary confi guration option for the table cache is table_open_cache  previously known as  just table_cache , which controls the maximum number of tables the cache can hold.  Simply setting this variable to the total number of tables in your databases is unlikely to yield good  results, however. To avoid locking problems when multiple clients simultaneously attempt to access  the same table, MySQL actually keeps a separate copy of the table open for each client accessing  it. Although this results in higher memory usage, it greatly improves performance. Therefore, the  most desirable size for the table cache is proportional to the max_connections — the more clients   simultaneously connected, the higher the number of open tables.  The last thing you want to happen is for tables to be opened and closed mid-query. Therefore, you  should aim for a cache size at least large enough to cope with a worst-case scenario in which the  maximum number of allowed clients is connected, each issuing queries across multiple tables. To  calculate this value, look through your web code for the most tables ever used in a single query,  and multiply by your max_connections. At a minimum, table_open_cache should be set to  this value.  Of course, this ensures that tables won’t be opened and closed mid-query. Ideally, you want the table  cache to be large enough to minimize the number of tables being opened — period. You could mod- ify the previous equation and set a value for the table cache equal to max_connections multiplied  by the total number of tables in your databases. But in many situations, this is overkill and would  use an unacceptably large amount of memory.  There are also some performance issues with large  table caches, which will be discussed shortly.  Instead, you should start with a reasonable minimum  value  given by the fi rst equation , then observe MySQL running, and tune the cache size up based  on how well the table cache is utilized.  The main variable of interest is opened_tables, which counts the number of times MySQL  has opened a table  that is, not served it from the table cache  since it was last restarted. By  observing the rate at which this increases, you can judge whether table_open_cache should be  increased.   NOTE   Don’t forget that because the table cache starts out empty, opened_ tables will initially increase rapidly before gradually tailing off. Therefore, you  should avoid sampling these fi gures until MySQL has been running for some  time.  Twenty-four hours is generally considered the minimum.   c08.indd   199 c08.indd   199  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   200  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  The following results were taken from a dedicated MySQL server with 6 GB of RAM.  max_connections was set to 1000 and table_open_cache to 3000.  The biggest JOIN query  ran on three tables.  MySQL had been running for more than one week.  After a few minutes, the query was rerun and produced the following results:  mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Opened_tables'; +---------------+-------+  Variable_name  Value  +---------------+-------+  Opened_tables  19915  +---------------+-------+  mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Opened_tables'; +---------------+-------+  Variable_name  Value  +---------------+-------+  Opened_tables  19978  +---------------+-------+  With 63 tables having been opened in this period, you should defi nitely look at increasing  table_open_cache.  An additional way to analyze the effectiveness of table caching is to look at the number of currently  open tables, as shown here:  mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Open_tables'; +---------------+-------+  Variable_name  Value  +---------------+-------+  Open_tables    3002   +---------------+-------+  In other words, the table cache is full. Increasing the size should be your priority here  memory  permitting .   NOTE   Incidentally, if you wonder how you can have 3,002 open tables when  the table cache size is only 3,000, MySQL enables the cache size to be temporar- ily increased if none of the existing cached tables can be removed  because they  are all in use by other clients .  table_deﬁ nition_cache  New to MySQL version 5.1 was table_definition_cache, a lightweight partner to the table cache.  One drawback of the table cache  aside from memory usage  is that it requires a lot of fi le descriptors   which you’ll learn more about shortly , and the table defi nition cache offers an alternative strategy  in which only the table defi nitions  describing the structure of the table, column types, indexing, and  so on  are held in memory. Because these are not open tables, entries in this cache aren’t using fi le  descriptors, and the memory footprint of each entry is a lot lower than table_cache.  c08.indd   200 c08.indd   200  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning MySQL  ❘  201  Despite these advantages, table_definition_cache doesn’t offer as great a performance increase  as the standard table_cache. The recommended way to utilize it is as a secondary caching mecha- nism when the table cache becomes full.  In some situations, memory constraints, max_connections,  or the sheer number of tables that exist mean that it is impractical to set table_open_cache large  enough to hold all tables.  The default value in MySQL version 5.5 upward is 400, and any value  from 256 to 524,288 is permitted.  File Descriptors and open_ﬁ les_limit  File descriptors  sometimes referred to as fi le handles  are created by the operating system when a  fi le is opened, and the kernel imposes limits on both the number of descriptors a particular process  can create, and the maximum number of descriptors globally. A large table cache means lots of open  fi les. In the case of MyISAM tables, two descriptors are needed per table, and, in some situations, this  can cause the operating system to run out of fi le descriptors.  In Linux, you can view the current global limit via proc, as shown here:  But, for more details, inspect via file-nr, as shown here:  $ cat  proc sys fs file-max 205094  $ cat  proc sys fs file-nr 6688    184       205094  These three columns show the following:   ➤ The number of descriptors currently in use   ➤ The number of allocated descriptors available   ➤ The maximum number of descriptors that can be allocated  As fi les are opened, and descriptors are allocated, this second fi eld decreases. When it gets to zero   or close to zero , Linux simply makes more descriptors available, up to the maximum.  It’s unlikely that MySQL alone can exhaust the global maximum number of descriptors.  But if it  is sharing a server with other busy services, it may be worth keeping an eye on usage.  Rather, the  problem for MySQL is usually the per-process descriptor limit imposed by Linux, which typically  defaults to 1,024 — too small in many cases. You can inspect and set this limit in the bash shell  using ulimit, as shown here:  The root user also has the power to change this limit, as shown here:   ulimit -n 1024   ulimit -n 2048  ulimit -n 2048  c08.indd   201 c08.indd   201  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   202  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  You can inspect the limit imposed on any running process by inspecting  proc _PID_ limits, as  shown here:   cat  proc 'pidof  usr local mysql bin mysqld' limitsgrep "Max open files" Max open files            3310                 3310                 files  NOTE   The fi rst fi gure is the soft limit, and second is the hard limit.  It’s not uncommon for init scripts to use ulimit to raise the fi le descriptor limit for the daemons  they launch, and this is one way to solve the problem with MySQL. However, MySQL provides an  easier solution, the open_files_limit confi guration option, which essentially does this same thing.   The value is actually just passed to mysqld_safe, which calls ulimit.   If you fi nd MySQL complaining about Too Many Open Files, raising open_files_limit should  be your fi rst avenue. You can estimate a suitable minimum value based on the earlier observa- tions that MyISAM tables need two descriptors per table, and the maximum number of open tables  is  determined by the table_open_cache size.  However, this limit can be temporarily exceeded.   However, don’t forget that MySQL still needs fi le descriptors for other things, too.  For InnoDB, the number of fi le descriptors needed depends on the storage method being used.  You’ll  learn about these shortly in the section, “Tuning InnoDB.”  Traditionally, all InnoDB tables were  held in a single fi le  hence the “too many open fi les” problem rarely appeared , but there is now also  the option to store each table in its own fi le. Unlike MyISAM, only one fi le per table is used.  NOTE   Under Windows, MySQL version 5.1 and earlier had a hard limit of  2,048 fi le descriptors. The problem has been fi xed in version 5.5 and later.  Table Cache Scaling  A recurring theme with MySQL cache tuning  and sometimes caching in general  is that bigger is  better — but often only up to a point. Throughout this chapter, you’ll see examples of situations in  which setting a cache too large can actually be detrimental to performance.  The table cache is one such case. As the size of the table cache increases, the speed at which tables  can be closed  which is triggered if the table cache is full  actually decreases. Thus, if you are in a  situation where you have lots of frequently used tables, and you know that the table cache can never  be big enough to hold them all, a lot of table opening and closing will be inevitable. It may make  sense to keep the table cache small to speed up this activity. Admittedly, this is a somewhat extreme  scenario, but it does illustrate the dangers of blindly following the “bigger is better” mantra.  Thread Caching  MySQL is a multithreaded service. As such, a new thread must be created each time a client   connects. On busy servers, this can result in a signifi cant amount of time spent simply creating  and destroying threads.  c08.indd   202 c08.indd   202  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning MySQL  ❘  203  To combat this, MySQL provides a thread cache to allow existing threads to be reused. When a cli- ent connects, MySQL fi rst checks the thread cache. If there is a spare thread, it is used; otherwise, a  new thread is created. When the client disconnects, the thread is placed in the cache for future use.  The size of the thread cache is controlled by thread_cache_size, which accepts values between 0  at 16,384. Note that the default size is zero, effectively disabling this feature.  How big should the cache be? Although there is a performance hit associated with creating and  destroying threads, it may not be particularly noticeable unless the server receives many connections  per second. So, in some situations, the thread cache may have an impact on performance. In other  situations, the effect will be marginal.  Let’s start by looking at the counters available for inspecting thread activity:  > SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'thread%'; +-------------------+--------+  Variable_name      Value   +-------------------+--------+  Threads_cached     2        Threads_connected  10       Threads_created    158703   Threads_running    2       +-------------------+--------+  Threads_cached shows the number of threads currently in the cache, naturally enough, whereas  Threads_connected gives the number of currently open connections. Because some of these open  connections may be sleeping, waiting for further queries, Threads_running displays how many of  these are actually running.  Of particular interest is Threads_created, which shows the number of times a thread has been  created  that is, not served from the cache  since MySQL was last restarted. Because this value is  dependent on MySQL’s uptime, the absolute value is largely irrelevant. Instead, you are interested  in the rate of change — that is, how fast the counter is increasing. If the number of threads created  is increasingly rapidly, you should look at increasing the thread_cache size. If the rate of increase is  modest, there will probably be little to gain from upping the cache size.  Another statistic you can look at is the connections counter. By dividing the number of threads cre- ated by this  shown previously as 158,703 , you can calculate the cache miss ratio.  > SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Connections';  +---------------+---------+  Variable_name  Value    +---------------+---------+  Connections    9201962  +---------------+---------+  In this example, you would arrive at a miss ratio of 0.0173  158,703 9,201,962  — in other words,  the vast majority of connections use threads from the cache. Be wary of attaching too much   signifi cance to this ratio, though, because it doesn’t tell you the actual number of threads created.  On a relatively quiet server, a high miss ratio might translate to only one or two new threads per  minute. Conversely, on a busy server, an apparently healthy miss ratio may hide that hundreds of   c08.indd   203 c08.indd   203  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   204  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  new threads are created each minute. This is an important point, and one that will be repeated when  looking at other caches.  Per-Session Buff ers  Although the table cache and thread cache are important enough to warrant detailed study, there  are also a number of other lesser buffers worth a brief examination. None of these is specifi c to a  particular storage engine, and, in most cases, none offer potential performance gains anywhere near  the table and thread caches. But there are always exceptions to the rule.  sort_buff er_size  The sort buffer is allocated on a per-client basis for any query that needs to perform a sort  operation   that is, ORDER BY and GROUP BY operations . The whole buffer is allocated in one go, so setting  sort_buffer_size too high can quickly use up a lot of memory if max_connections is high, aside  from the performance penalty of allocating overly large chunks of memory.  On Linux, MySQL uses mmap   rather than malloc   for allocating sort buffer sizes larger than  256 KB, and this is somewhat slower. So, ideally you should keep the sort buffer at 256 KB or less.  There is a similar threshold at 2 MB. If you do require a value higher than 256 KB, you should also  aim to keep it under 2 MB.  If you have only a few queries that would benefi t from a large sort buffer, you can set a modest  global default and then increase it on a per-session basis by issuing a SET SESSION query after  connecting.  read_buff er_size  The read buffer is used for queries that perform sequential scans of tables. As with the sort buffer,  the full buffer size is allocated for queries that need it  by using read_buffer_size , and so similar  caveats apply. Again, there are also thresholds at 256 KB and 2 MB, above which performance can  drop, and you are advised not to blindly raise this value too high  unless you have a good reason .  In particular, LIMIT queries on large tables can cause some unexpected detrimental behavior when  read_buffer_size is set too high. In these situations, the whole table is read into the buffer;  although only the number of rows specifi ed by LIMIT is returned — the rest are simply discarded.  read_rnd_buff er_size  The read_rnd cache is the counterpart to read_buffer used when reading sorted rows  rather than  sequential rows  and helps to cut down on disk seeks. However, as with the sort and read buffers,  this cache is allocated per client, and you should be careful not to raise it too high globally. Instead,  set it on a per-session basis with SET SESSION.  join_buff er_size  join buffers are allocated per-session, with one buffer for each non-indexed join between two  tables. Thus, with complex queries, multiple join buffers may be created. They are used for only   c08.indd   204 c08.indd   204  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning MyISAM  ❘  205  non-indexed joins, and, in most cases, better column indexing produces a greater performance  increase than raising this buffer. As with the other per-session buffers discussed here, care should be  taken not to make the join buffer too big.  Having looked at tuning aspects of MySQL itself, let’s take a look at performance aspects of the  main storage engines  MyISAM and InnoDB . While many of the MyISAM options are well known,  InnoDB is evolving rapidly, and new features are regularly being added. As such, even if you are an  old hand at confi guring MySQL, you may learn something new.  TUNING MYISAM  Key Cache  There is a distinct difference between tuning options of MySQL  which you just learned about  and  tuning of individual engines. So, let’s now look at MyISAM-specifi c settings, and, later in this chapter,  tuning for the InnoDB engine will be examined.  The MyISAM key cache is a memory buffer used to hold frequently accessed index  key  blocks. The  size of the cache can be one of the most important MyISAM-specifi c tuning options, yet there is also a  lot of misinformation about picking an appropriate size. Unfortunately, a large amount of guessing  is often involved.  The key_buffer_size ini directive is used to control the size of the cache, with a value of zero  disabling it. Disabling the cache isn’t quite as bad as it may seem because the operating system’s disk  buffering should help to reduce the frequency of index reads from disk. But it is still advisable to  turn the key cache on and set it to a reasonable size.  For a dedicated MySQL server, the general rule of thumb is to allocate between 25 percent and 50  percent of the total memory to the key cache. However, as always, this is only a rough fi gure.   If you have a particularly small dataset  or a huge amount of memory , this fi gure may be too large.  Conversely, you should be careful not to set this fi gure too high. The key cache is used only for   buffering indexes, and MySQL still needs memory for the tables’ contents.   If the key cache is too large, the system may run out of physical memory and start swapping — a  situation that can cause a huge deterioration in performance. Remember that the key cache is for  MyISAM tables only. InnoDB tables have their own buffer, and the size of the MyISAM key cache needs  to be reduced.  So, how do you determine a suitable size for the cache? Looking at MySQL’s counters is a good  start, as shown here:  mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE '%key_read%'; +-------------------+----------+  Variable_name      Value     +-------------------+----------+  Key_read_requests  14052595   Key_reads          96504     +-------------------+----------+  c08.indd   205 c08.indd   205  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   206  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  Key_read_requests shows the total number of requests to read a key block, whereas Key_reads  shows the number of times a key block was read from disk  because it was not in the cache . You  can calculate the ratio of cache misses by dividing Key_reads by Key_read_requests. In the   previous example, you would end up with a fi gure of 0.0069  96,504 1,405,295 .  Because you know that reading from disk is several orders of magnitude slower than reading from  memory, it follows that you should probably experiment with increasing the key buffer size in an  attempt to reduce the number of Key_reads. Unfortunately, things aren’t quite that simple. You’ll often  hear fi gures bandied about — the most popular seems to be that the cache miss ratio shouldn’t exceed  approximately 0.01 — but, by now, you should know to treat such statements with a pinch of salt.  For starters, a ratio is just that. It contains no information on the actual number of misses, nor the  period of time over which these misses occurred.   Consider the situation of a MySQL server that has been running for the past 24 hours. During  this time, there have been 1,000 key read requests and 48 key reads. This yields a miss ratio of  0.048  almost fi ve times higher than many sources recommend , and yet this translates only as two  disk-based key reads per hour  on average . Conversely, on a server that handled 288,000 key read  requests during the past 24 hours, of which 1,440 had been from disk, the healthy looking miss  ratio of 0.005 fails to tell the full story — that disk-based key reads have been averaging one per  second [1440  24 × 60 ]. The second problem with this ratio is the assumption that cache misses will actually be several  orders of magnitude slower. Because many operating systems use free memory for caching disk I O,  you can’t be sure that these key reads will actually be from disk at all.  Finally, you must also be careful not to sample these counters too soon after a server restart. As  you know, the key buffer starts out empty — hence, the miss ratio starts out high and gradually  decreases over time.  Perhaps a more useful metric would be to look at the rate of change of the key read counters because  this would tell you how many potential disk reads were occurring per unit interval. To do this, you  can simply execute SHOW STATUS LIKE '%key_read%', as shown here:  mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE '%key_read%'; +-------------------+-------------+  Variable_name      Value        +-------------------+-------------+  Key_read_requests  14092559640   Key_reads          889876       +-------------------+-------------+  Then, wait about 30 seconds, and run it again:  mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE '%key_read%'; +-------------------+-------------+  Variable_name      Value        +-------------------+-------------+  Key_read_requests  14092701815   Key_reads          889877       +-------------------+-------------+  c08.indd   206 c08.indd   206  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning MyISAM  ❘  207  Here you see 142,175 read requests  14,092,701,815 – 1,4092,559,640 , of which only 1 resulted in  a  possible  disk read.  You can take this one step further and use mysqladmin to generate stats at regular intervals  in this  example, every 60 seconds :   mysqladmin ext -ri60  grep Key_reads  Key_reads                          889918                 Key_reads                          6                      Key_reads                          4                      Key_reads                          6                      Key_reads                          4                      Key_reads                          5                      Key_reads                          3                      Key_reads                          1                      Key_reads                          4                      Discounting the fi rst fi eld  which shows the total number of key reads so far , you can see that MySQL  averages approximately four key reads — which may or may not result in disk reads — every minute.  You can now ask two questions. Is this level of potential disk activity liable to cause a deterioration  in performance for other aspects of MySQL  or other services running on the system ? Is disk activ- ity high enough  or the disks slow enough  that reading these blocks from disk will cause a signifi cant  performance penalty?  Note that iostat can shed further light on both these questions.  In many  cases, the answers to both of these questions will be “no,” and a small level of cache misses is quite  acceptable.  Index Preloading  When MySQL is fi rst started, the key cache is naturally empty, and blocks are gradually added to it  as they are accessed from disk. This adds a little overhead, and also results in index blocks existing  in the cache in a somewhat scattered fashion.  Assuming the key cache is big enough to hold them, you can preload entire indexes into the buffer by  using the LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE   statement. This has the advantage of sequential  blocks being faster to access, and cuts down on possible disk reads at a later stage. Optionally, you  can append IGNORE LEAVES to not preload leaf nodes. This helps to counter the main disadvantage  of this technique — that loading an entire index into the cache will be wasting valuable space if many  blocks are never accessed.  The preload_buffer_size variable can be used to control the size of the cache used when preload- ing indexes. The default value is 32,768, with accepted values in the range 1,024 to 1,073,741,824  bytes  1 GB .  Optimum Block Sizes  MySQL enables you to control the size of the blocks of memory used in the cache with the key_cache_ block_size confi guration option. In addition to this, you can also tune the size of blocks in the physi- cal index fi les using the –myisam_block_size startup option. Accepted values for both range from 512  to 1,6384 bytes, with the defaults being 1,024 bytes.  c08.indd   207 c08.indd   207  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   208  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  Your motivation for changing these is to match the block size used by Linux for disk I O  not to be  confused with the fi lesystem’s block size . On x86 Linux, use a value of 4 KB.  NOTE   On most fl avors of UNIX  including Linux , the following Perl one-liner  can be used to show the disk I O block size:  perl -e '$a= stat "." [11]; print $a'  Other fl avors of UNIX support adding the -g fl ag to the df command to show  block sizes.  On Windows, the fsutil command can be used  look for the Bytes Per Cluster  value in the output .  Using Multiple Key Caches  Prior to MySQL version 4.1, access to the key caches was linear, with only one request allowed at a  time. Fortunately, this situation has now changed, but there are still a couple of caveats:   ➤ If the buffer is being updated, clients must still wait for the update to complete before they   can access it.   ➤ If the buffer is full, concurrent accesses are permitted only if they do not cause keys being   used by another client to be purged from the cache.  To reduce these problems, MySQL enables you to create multiple key caches of user-defi ned sizes.  After allocating a name and size to these caches, you can then assign individual table indexes to  them.  Any indexes not assigned will continue to use the default key cache.  Following is an example:  mysql> SET GLOBAL mycache1.key_buffer_size=1024*1024*16;  Here, a cache named 'mycache1' has been created, and 16 MB of memory has been allocated to it.   The syntax for querying the size of the cache, or the size of each block, is a little different and  requires you to use the @@GLOBAL syntax, as shown here:  mysql> select @@GLOBAL.mycache1.key_buffer_size; +-------------------------------+  @@GLOBAL.mycache1.key_buffer_size  +-------------------------------+                       16777216  +-------------------------------+  mysql> select @@GLOBAL.mycache1.key_cache_block_size; +------------------------------------+  @@GLOBAL.mycache1.key_cache_block_size  +------------------------------------+                                1024  +------------------------------------+  c08.indd   208 c08.indd   208  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning MyISAM  ❘  209  The CACHE INDEX statement is used to assign the indexes on a table to a given key cache, as shown here:  mysql> CACHE INDEX categories, comments IN mycache1; +-----------------+--------------------+----------+----------+  Table            Op                  Msg_type  Msg_text  +-----------------+--------------------+----------+----------+  live.categories  assign_to_keycache  status    OK         live.comments    assign_to_keycache  status    OK        +-----------------+--------------------+----------+----------+  Aside from the benefi ts of reduced contention, you attain more control over block retention through  careful selection of which indexes to cache where. For example, if you have an index that you never  want to be fl ushed from the cache  by the LRU or MIS implementations , you can assign it to its own  key cache  making sure that the cache is large enough to fi t the index .  Hot, Cold, and Warm Caches The MySQL documentation also outlines a suggested three-tier setup, in which indexes are assigned  to a cache based on how static or dynamic they are likely to be. Let’s take a broad look at this.  You assign 60 percent of your key cache memory to the default cache and then create two additional  caches, each of 20 percent. The fi rst of these new caches, referred to as the hot cache, is used for the  indexes of tables that are searched heavily, but rarely updated. The second custom cache, the cold  cache, is used for tables that are frequently being modifi ed. All other indexes go in the default cache,  which is referred to as the warm cache, and contains tables that fall in the middle ground  that is,  neither hot nor cold .  Because index blocks in the hot cache never  or rarely  change, if you reach the stage where the  cache is full and blocks must be removed to make way for new ones, the purged blocks won’t need  to be written back to disk.  The use of a cold cache improves the chances that the frequently modifi ed  but not necessarily  searched  indexes remain in memory. This makes updating of the index much faster.  Conﬁ guring Multiple Key Caches So far, you’ve learned how to create custom key caches at the MySQL prompt. To conclude this sec- tion, let’s briefl y look at the confi guration fi le syntax.  For creating a cache, you simply prepend your wanted cache name to the beginning of the variable,  as shown here:  mycache1.key_buffer_size = 512M mycache2.key_buffer_size = 1G  Things are a little tricky if you want to automate the CACHE INDEX statement to assign table indexes  to these caches. For this, you need an init fi le, which you simply populate with the queries to exe- cute, as shown here:  CACHE INDEX categories, comments IN mycache1 CACHE INDEX userprofiles IN mycache2  c08.indd   209 c08.indd   209  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   210  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  You then source this fi le  you can imagine that it has been saved as  var lib mysql custom.sql   from my.cnf like so:  init_file= var lib mysql custom.sql  Caching Algorithms  When the key cache becomes full, an LRU retention policy is used by default — that is, frequently  used blocks are more likely to remain in the cache than less frequently used ones. If a block set for  removal is dirty  that is, it has been modifi ed since it was read in from disk , it is written back to  disk fi rst.  If the LRU policy seems a little crude, MyISAM also supports a Midpoint Insertion Strategy  MIS .   If you choose to use MIS for the key cache, there are a couple of confi guration options to set:   ➤ key_cache_division_limit — This specifi es the percentage of the key cache to allocate to  the warm list. The default value, 100, effectively causes MIS to be disabled  because the hot  list will be of zero size . When lowering this value, remember that the warm list will be used  more than the hot list, and the sizes of each should refl ect this. Broadly speaking, a division  limit of approximately 60 percent to 90 percent should be right in most cases.   ➤ key_cache_age_threshold — This controls how long an unused entry should stay in the   hot list before being moved back into the warm list. The default is 300 seconds, and permit- ted values range from 100 seconds upward.  Miscellaneous Tuning Options  Although the key cache is the cornerstone of tuning performance of MyISAM tables, there are a num- ber of other MyISAM-specifi c confi guration options that can help, so let’s take a brief look at some of  them.  concurrent_insert  Enabled by default, the concurrent_insert option enables INSERT statements to be executed on  a table at the same time as SELECT queries are reading from it. This partly alleviates the table-level  locking previously described.  Although it does nothing to help the table-level locking that occurs on  UPDATE and DELETE queries.   Things aren’t quite that simple, though. The concurrent_insert variable actually supports three  settings:    ➤ A setting of 0 turns this option off.   ➤ A setting of 1  the default  enables concurrent inserts only when there are no deleted rows in   the middle of the table.    ➤ A setting of 2 enables concurrent inserts even if such deleted rows exist. If any SELECT    queries are running, the data will be inserted at the end of the table. Otherwise, it will be  inserted in the gap left by the deleted row  the default behavior .  c08.indd   210 c08.indd   210  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning InnoDB  ❘  211  low_priority_updates  Despite its name, low_priority_updates doesn’t just lower the priority of UPDATEs — it also  applies to DELETEs and INSERTs. As you might have guessed, it causes queries that modify a table  to have a lower priority than those that read from it. So, if multiple queries are waiting to be run  against a table, write queries are pushed to the bottom of the queue.  If you choose not to enable this option globally, it can still be set on a per-query basis using the fol- lowing syntax:   update low_priority into …  delay_key_write  When a MyISAM index key is updated, the default behavior is to write the changes back to disk. For  frequently modifi ed tables, this can result in a lot of disk writes. By enabling delay_key_write  either  on a per table basis, or globally by specifying a value of ALL , changes to the indexes are buffered in  memory, and not written out to disk until the table is closed. This greatly speeds up index updates.  The downside is that if MySQL is not shut down cleanly, there’s a good chance of index corruption   because the buffer will not have been fl ushed to disk . You can fi x this with myisamchk, but for big  tables, it will take a while to run.  As you have seen, MyISAM provides a wealth of tunable confi guration options, and careful use of  these can have a huge impact on how well MySQL is able to handle heavy usage.  For many years, MyISAM was the de facto storage engine, and InnoDB was seen as something of a  specialist engine, mainly used in situations where transactions were needed. This is emphatically  no longer the case, and InnoDB has evolved  and continues to do so  into a very powerful storage  engine. Let’s take a closer look at it.  TUNING INNODB  Monitoring InnoDB  InnoDB has come a long way over the last few years, and provides an impressive set of confi gurable  parameters. Since InnoDB has become the default storage engine for MySQL, this situation can only  improve. Certainly, as you’ll see in this section, InnoDB is where all the exciting developments are  taking place.  The primary means of monitoring the status of InnoDB is via the InnoDB monitor, accessible via the  following command:  show engine innodb status\G  This provides detailed information on the health of various aspects of InnoDB, including threads,  buffers, and semaphores. Although the majority of this information probably doesn’t mean much at  this stage, each of these areas will be covered in the following sections.  c08.indd   211 c08.indd   211  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   212  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  Figure 8-2 shows the fi rst page of the monitor’s output taken from a busy database server.  FIGURE 8-2  Working with Buff ers and Caches  The InnoDB buffer pool  innodb_buffer_pool_size in my.cnf  is the most important cache pro- vided by InnoDB, holding a similar importance to the key buffer in MyISAM. But whereas the MyISAM  key buffer caches only indexes, leaving caching of data to the underlying operating system, InnoDB  caches both indexes and data in its buffer pool. Taking this task away from the operating system  gives extra responsibility to InnoDB, and, as you’ll see shortly, a more advanced LRU algorithm is  used.  In an ideal world, you’d make the buffer pool large enough to hold all your data, thus drastically  reducing disk I O access times. This largely depends on the size of your data, but in many situations,  it is feasible, albeit with several potential hurdles along the way.  On 32-bit hardware, a process won’t access more than 4 GB of memory. However, 32-bit architec- tures are becoming increasingly uncommon, especially on high-end servers, and, in most situations,  this won’t be an issue.  Even if the entire data set won’t fi t into memory, you should still strive to make the buffer pool as  big as possible. The buffer pool itself has some overhead, as does the rest of MySQL, and you must  ensure that you leave enough memory for these and other applications running on the server.  c08.indd   212 c08.indd   212  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning InnoDB  ❘  213  One issue that may get in the way is the disk buffering implemented by the operating system. As  you have already seen, many operating systems reduce disk I O by caching reads and writes in free  memory, and this largely duplicates the caching done in the buffer pool by InnoDB. This can poten- tially lead to double-buffering situations, with data cached in both places. Usually, you might prefer  operating system-level caching, but in this situation, the InnoDB buffer pool is much better suited for  the job. Thus, you want to prevent the operating system from also caching the data.  As luck would have it, MySQL provides a cnf setting for this, innodb_flush_method. By setting  this to O_DIRECT, you can eliminate operating system-level caching for InnoDB. In case you wonder,  double buffering is an issue with MyISAM, too. It’s just that MyISAM doesn’t provide a way to bypass it.  NOTE   O_DIRECT is only available on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. On  Windows, the fl ush method is always unbuffered.  NUMA AND SWAPPING  Linux will swap out pages of memory to disk if it starts to run out of physical mem- ory. But a signifi cant number of MySQL users on high-end servers have observed  behavior where Linux starts to swap heavily, despite there being plenty of free mem- ory. Naturally, this is a performance killer and seems bizarre.  The explanation turns out to center on low-level kernel memory management  on newer multiprocessor machines. In traditional symmetric multiprocess- ing  SMP  — also known as Uniform Memory Access  UMA  — architectures   consisting of a single processor with multiple cores, each core has equal access  to the available memory. By contrast, Non-Uniform Memory Access  NUMA   architectures  of which the AMD Opteron was one of the fi rst  divide the memory  between each processor  processor, not core . Each processor can still access the  entire range of system memory, but some regions of memory will be closer — and  hence lower latency — than others.   To quantify this, on a NUMA machine with two processors and 32 GB of RAM, each  processor has 16 GB of local RAM. Processes prefer to use this local RAM because  of the lower latency, but, of course, they may still use the nonlocal RAM if necessary.   However, this does not mean that each processor is limited to accessing 16 GB of  memory!   The problems start when a single process requires more memory than what is local  to the processor on which it is running. In these situations, some version of the  Linux 2.6 kernel decides it would be better to swap out to disk than suffer the slight  performance hit of accessing this nonlocal memory. The result is swapping, despite  there being lots of free memory.  continues  c08.indd   213 c08.indd   213  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   214  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  continued Some administrators have attempted to solve this problem by simply turning off  swap space, but this is certainly not recommended. Although you generally want  to strive to avoid signifi cant swapping at all costs, swap spaces provide a useful   safeguard if there is a temporary spike in memory usage. Without that swap space,  the kernel OOM  out of memory  killer would simply kick on and start killing   processes to free up memory. In this situation, swapping is probably the lesser evil.  A better solution is to launch MySQL with the –memlock option, which uses the  underlying kernel function mlockall to lock a process in memory, preventing it from  being swapped. Numerous bugs have been reported in mlockall, however, which  may cause stability problems — a lot depends on your distribution and kernel.  Another partial solution is to change the swappiness of the system with the  following:  echo 0 >  proc sys vm swappiness  Remember, though, that this doesn’t prevent swapping. It merely discourages it.  Finally, you can also use the numactl tool to confi gure how Linux treats memory on  NUMA architectures. Adding the following entry to mysqld_safe causes MySQL  to launch with interleaved memory  that is, the memory used for MySQL will be  spread out evenly, reducing the likelihood that the memory local to a particular   processor will become full :  cmd=" usr bin numactl --interleave all $cmd"  Managing the Buff er Pool  InnoDB uses a modifi ed LRU for the buffer pool, based on an MIS.   With the InnoDB buffer pool, the default division is for the cold list  containing less frequently  accessed items  to occupy 37 percent of the pool size, with the hot list  frequently accessed items   taking the remaining space. Should you want, though, you can change this value with the innodb_ old_blocks_pct confi guration option, which accepts values in the range 5 to 95.  For applications that occasionally access large tables, it often make sense to reduce innodb_old_ blocks_pct, to prevent this less commonly accessed data from being cached so heavily. Conversely,  for small, frequently accessed tables, raising innodb_old_blocks_pct increases the likelihood that  this data will be kept in memory for future use.  As with other MIS algorithms, new pages are inserted at the top of the cold list, making them prime  candidates for promotion to the hot list. Occasionally, though, this behavior is not wanted because  it may cause a page that is accessed a couple of times in short succession, and then never again to be  promoted. In fact, during a table scan, blocks are accessed several times in short succession, so even  one SQL query may be enough to promote the data to the hot list.  c08.indd   214 c08.indd   214  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning InnoDB  ❘  215  InnoDB provides a way to control this behavior via innodb_old_blocks_time. This confi gura- tion option controls the number of milliseconds that must elapse before a newly added page can be   promoted to the hot list. The default value is zero, but raising this to a relatively small value  such  as 500 milliseconds  can go a long way to preventing this “problem.”  However, this MIS insertion  strategy isn’t always  undesirable behavior.   Inspecting the Buff er Pool  The primary means to monitor the buffer pool is via the InnoDB monitor   show engine innodb status , and the following snippet shows some sample output:  ---------------------- BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY ---------------------- Total memory allocated 160972800; in additional pool allocated 0 Dictionary memory allocated 99761 Buffer pool size   9599 Free buffers       0 Database pages     15549 Old database pages 5720 Modified db pages  0 Pending reads 0 Pending writes: LRU 0, flush list 0, single page 0 Pages made young 7042, not young 263971 0.12 youngs s, 5.02 non-youngs s Pages read 49210, created 10, written 1538 0.93 reads s, 0.00 creates s, 0.00 writes s Buffer pool hit rate 984   1000, young-making rate 2   1000 not 88   1000 Pages read ahead 0.00 s, evicted without access 0.00 s LRU len: 15549, unzip_LRU len: 1556 I O sum[44]:cur[0], unzip sum[29]:cur[0]  Of particular interest are the following fi elds:   ➤ Database pages — This is the number of pages  by default 16,000  in the buffer pool.   ➤ Old database pages — This is the number of pages in the cold list. Subtracting this value   from Database pages gives the number of pages in the hot list.   ➤ Pages made young — This is the number of pages that have been promoted from the cold    ➤ Pages made not young — This is the number of pages that have stayed in the cold list   list to the hot list.  without being promoted.   ➤ youngs  not-youngs  s — This shows the rate  in seconds  at which pages in the cold list   have or have not been promoted to the hot list.  As you have seen, the promotion of pages from the cold to hot list is sometimes undesirable, espe- cially in situations where the promoted pages are unlikely to be accessed regularly. This information  can give you an insight into this. As always, though, it’s generally the rate of change  youngs s and  non-youngs s  that you should be most interested in, rather than absolute fi gures. A low number   c08.indd   215 c08.indd   215  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   216  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  of youngs s shows that few pages are promoted to the hot list. In an application that regularly  accesses the same data, this would suggest that innodb_old_blocks_time be lowered. Conversely,  a high number of youngs s on applications that perform frequent large scans would suggest that  innodb_old_blocks_time be raised.  In addition to taking into consideration the general behavior of your application  for example, is  there any benefi t to modifying the behavior of a hot list promotion? , it can be benefi cial to look at  these statistics during any regular irregular activity, such as the daily generation of reports.  In such  situations, you probably don’t want a high youngs s rate.   Using Multiple Buff er Pools  On busy systems with large buffer pools, there will typically be many threads accessing data simul- taneously from the buffer pool, and this contention can be a bottleneck. Starting with MySQL ver- sion 5.5, InnoDB enables multiple buffer pools to be created. Each is managed independently and  maintains its own LRU and mutual exclusion  mutex . Cached data is randomly assigned to the  pools, however, so the database administrator has no control over how the data is divided.  NOTE   You’ll learn more about mutexes later in this chapter.  The innodb_buffer_pool_instances confi guration option is used to control this and takes a value  between 1  the default  and 64. Because the use of multiple pools is intended only for high-end sys- tems, this option has no effect when innodb_buffer_pool_size is lower than 1 GB.  Insert Buff ering  A subset of the buffer pool, the insert buffer is used to cache changes made to secondary indexes.  Write queries on a table often result in secondary indexes becoming unordered, and re-ordering  them can be I O-intensive  unless the affected pages are already in the buffer pool . By caching these  changes, they can be grouped together and executed when the affected pages are next loaded into  the buffer pool.  This buffer can dramatically reduce disk I O in applications that perform many write queries on  tables. However, because it is part of the buffer pool, it also reduces the amount of memory avail- able for data page caching. For this reason, if memory is in short supply, it may make sense to dis- able insert buffering — especially for data that has few secondary indexes.  The innodb_change_buffering confi guration option controls whether such changes are buffered.  Starting with MySQL version 5.5, this option also enables you to control what will be buffered.  Following are accepted values for innodb_change_buffering:   ➤ All — Caches inserts, deletes, and purges  physical deletion . This is the default value.   ➤ None — Disables the insert buffer.   ➤ Inserts — Caches insert operations only.  c08.indd   216 c08.indd   216  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning InnoDB  ❘  217   ➤ Deletes — Caches delete operations.   ➤ Changes — Caches both inserts and deletes.   ➤ Purges — Caches purges only.  Adaptive Hashing  Adaptive hashing is a feature of InnoDB designed to improve performance on machines with large  amounts of physical memory.  For tables that almost fi t fully into memory, hash indexes provide a faster means of lookup than the  default B-tree indexes. With adaptive hashing enabled, MySQL monitors index-based queries and  built in-memory hash tables on those indexes that are frequently accessed.  In many cases, this does improve performance. But it’s worth remembering that these hashes require  maintenance, just like any other index. This results in locking when the hashes are written to, and  on multiprocessor machines  where innodb_thread_concurrency is higher , deadlock can occur.  If you do choose to enable adaptive hashing, look out for frequent Holds Adaptive Hash Latch   messages in the transactions section of the InnoDB monitor.  Adaptive hashing can be enabled disabled via the ini setting innodb_adaptive_hash_index.  Working with File Formats and Structures  As with most other storage engines  MEMORY being the most notable exception , data in InnoDB data- bases is held on disk, and this underlying storage can have an effect on performance. In this section,  you learn how InnoDB arranges fi les on disk, and how the structure of these fi les impacts the speed  of searching on primary and secondary indexes.  Mutliple Tablespaces  InnoDB has traditionally used a single fi le to hold all data in all databases. This is in contrast to  MyISAM’s use of a directory for each database, containing three fi les for each table  format, index,  data . However, multiple tablespaces are now also supported, allowing each table to occupy its own  fi le. The innodb_file_per_table directive can be used in my.cnf to control this.  The primary advantage here is fl exibility over where table fi les are stored. For example, you may  want to split them across disks for performance, or simply because of their size. The performance  gain is often over-estimated, though, and the most likely reason that you’d want to enable multiple  tablespaces is to allow table compression  which you’ll learn more about shortly .  Multiple tablespaces can actually be detrimental to performance because of increased disk I O and an  increase in the number of fi le descriptors used. InnoDB uses fsync   to fl ush data fi les after writes.  Unlike the preferred fdatasync  , fsync   also causes meta data such as the last modifi cation  time to be updated, increasing  albeit only slightly  the amount of data written. In addition, InnoDB  cannot group writes occurring across multiple tablespaces, leading to an increase in fsync   calls.  Coupled with the increased disk activity caused by using fsync   over fdatasync  , this can cause a   c08.indd   217 c08.indd   217  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   218  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  noticeable performance drop. For this reason, you should generally avoid multiple tablespaces unless  they are required  for example, for compression .  InnoDB version 1.0 introduced an alternative fi le format named Barracuda.  The existing format  has since been named Antelope.  Although there are a handful of small changes behind the scenes,  the primary concern here, of course, is with possible performance improvements. Mostly, there is  little difference between Antelope and Barracuda, but there are two new features to InnoDB for  which the Barracuda format must be used: compression and variable-length columns. Both of these  topics will be covered in detail shortly. The innodb_file_format ini directive is used to control  the format used when creating or altering a table.  File Formats  Data Structure  InnoDB stores data in a B-tree, using the primary index as the key. This results in excellent per- formance for lookups on a table’s primary key, but weaker performance when searching against  secondary keys. For fi xed-length columns, the data is stored directly under the node. But variable- length columns  such as varchar  — which may be too large to fi t in a B-tree page — pose a prob- lem. With the Antelope format, the fi rst 768 bytes of variable-length columns are stored in the  B-tree, and any remaining data is stored in a separate overfl ow page.  By storing the fi rst 768 bytes in the B-tree, you remove the need for overfl ow pages to be used  and,  hence, cut disk I O, too  for data smaller than this size. However, too many variable-length columns  can cause the B-tree to fi ll more heavily with data than indexes, reducing its effi ciency.  The Barracuda format offers some improvement on this situation. When ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC   or ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED  is used, variable-length columns more than 768 bytes are stored fully  off-page, which is naturally more effi cient that splitting the data across two locations.  Memory Allocation  InnoDB was initially developed at a time when multicore processors were starting to enter the main- stream market. The default memory allocation libraries of many operating systems were not tuned  for multiple cores, and the InnoDB developers made the decision to implement their own memory  allocation routines.  The situation has changed since then, and a handful of high-performance memory allocation libraries  are now available that surpass the performance of InnoDB’s own library. As such, you will probably  want to use one of these, rather than InnoDB’s.  The ini setting innodb_use_sys_malloc controls whether InnoDB uses its own library, or the under- lying operating system’s library. Setting this value to 1  the default  causes the library of the operating  system to be used. Note that enabling this limits InnoDB’s built-in memory-tracking statistics, which  decreases the verbosity of the memory section of the InnoDB monitor’s output.  c08.indd   218 c08.indd   218  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning InnoDB  ❘  219  MEMORY ALLOCATION IMPLEMENTATIONS  In Linux, the default C library is glibc, which uses ptmalloc2  itself an   enhancement of dlmalloc — the pt stands for per-thread  for memory allocation.  Numerous alternatives exist, and although they were often written with Linux in  mind, they mostly work across Windows and UNIX, too.   ➤   ➤   ➤  TCMalloc  thread-cache malloc  is Google’s implementation. It claims to be  much faster than ptmalloc, while also reducing lock contention  a problem  under multicore machines  via the use of spin locks. Despite this, it tends to  use more memory than the likes of ptmalloc2.  JEMalloc  named after Jason Evans, the author  is used on Facebook and in  Firefox. It is also the default malloc under FreeBSD. Implementations are  available for OS X, Solaris, and Windows; and performance is considered  similar to that of TCMalloc.  Nedmalloc claims to be faster than any other malloc implementation and is  primarily targeted at Windows; although it will happily run on most UNIX  derivatives, too.  Memory allocation isn’t just about InnoDB, or even MySQL, and is one of the most  under-appreciated aspects of system performance in general. Switching to an alter- native malloc implementation is painless, can be done on a per-application basis,  and usually results in a signifi cant performance improvement.  InnoDB makes extensive use of the threading capabilities of the underlying operating system, allow- ing it to scale well on multicore systems. Some threads are used to service user requests, whereas  others run in the background to perform housekeeping. The maximum number of threads used can  be raised and lowered, and there are both advantages and disadvantages to this.  In the past, it was often necessary to limit the number of concurrent threads because the high levels  of context switching would eat away at performance. However, increases in the scalability of both  operating systems and InnoDB on multicore architectures have decreased this need, and InnoDB gen- erally runs fi ne with no limit on the number of concurrent threads. Should you want to set a limit,  however, it is controlled by innodb_thread_concurrency, the default being zero  no limit .  Threading  Disk I O  Given that disk IO is the major bottleneck in many systems, it’s not surprising that the InnoDB devel- opers have devoted considerable time to optimizing performance in this area. When you learn more  about threading in the later section, “Background Threads,” you’ll see how fl ushing dirty pages  that  is, pages of memory that have been modifi ed and must be written back to disk  can cause spikes in  disk activity, and you’ll discover the ways in which InnoDB attempts to solve this. But, for the moment  let’s concentrate on the most signifi cant feature of disk I O handling — the read-ahead mechanism.  c08.indd   219 c08.indd   219  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   220  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  read-ahead Requests  read-ahead requests involve prefetching data from disk if usage patterns suggest that it may soon  be needed. In InnoDB, memory pages are grouped in extents, where an extent consists of 64 con- secutive pages. If more than a certain number of pages from an extent exists in the buffer cache,  MySQL preloads the remaining pages in the extent.  In the past, InnoDB supported two methods of read-ahead:    ➤ Random read-ahead — Here, the decision of whether to prefetch remaining pages was   based solely on the number of pages from the extent already in the buffer.   ➤ Linear read-ahead — Here, the decision is based on the number of sequential pages that   have been read.   In many cases however, random read-aheads actually reduced performance, and they were dropped  in InnoDB version 1.0.4.  So, that leaves linear read-aheads, which can be controlled via the innodb_read_ahead_ threshold ini directive. This variable controls the number of sequential pages in an extent that  must be accessed  and be in the buffer cache  to trigger a read-ahead for the remaining pages.   The default is 56.  When the last page of a sequence falls at the end of an extent, InnoDB will also  read in the whole of the next extent.  Although it may be tempting to set a low threshold, this, of course, increases disk activity, and could  prove counter-productive, because there will likely be a high level of “waste.” One useful metric to  look at is the number of pages prefetched and the number of pages that were subsequently evicted  from the buffer pool without having been accessed. You can do this like so:  mysql>  show status like '%ahead%'; +---------------------------------------+-------+  Variable_name                          Value  +---------------------------------------+-------+  Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead          4602    Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead_evicted  682    +---------------------------------------+-------+  Here, out of 4,602 pages prefetched, 682 were later evicted from the buffer cache without having  been used — so, approximately 15 percent. Trying to dictate rules over what constitutes an accept- able eviction rate is misguided, but because the general aim is to keep this fi gure lower, it gives you  a basis for monitoring any changes made to innodb_read_ahead_threshold. Also, any changes to  the operation of the buffer cache  such as changing the size or innodb_old_blocks_time  have an  impact on the eviction rate.  Similar metrics can be obtained from the InnoDB monitor, this time in the form of read-aheads and  evictions per second  since the monitor was last queried :  Pages read ahead 15.08 s, evicted without access 2.66 s  c08.indd   220 c08.indd   220  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning InnoDB  ❘  221  Background Threads  Previous versions of InnoDB used a single background thread for reading and writing to disk, but  starting with InnoDB version 1.0.4, this number is now confi gurable. Each thread can handle up to  256 pending requests, and a maximum of 64 threads may be confi gured. Two ini settings are pro- vided, each of which accept values in the range 1 to 64, and default to 4. They are innodb_read_ io_threads  maximum number of read threads  and innodb_write_io_threads   maximum number of write threads .  Before rushing to increase these limits, remember that they will not increase bandwidth on indi- vidual disks; although they will potentially help to alleviate bottlenecks in high-load environments,  where data is spread across multiple disks.  Then Pending reads and Pending writes columns of the InnoDB monitor’s output can help you judge  if the thread concurrency would benefi t from being raised. Recalling that each thread can queue up to  256 requests, if you see more than 256 × number of threads pending reads or writes, this will clearly  cause a bottleneck, and a gradual increase in the number of read write threads would be benefi cial.  Adaptive Flushing  In earlier versions of InnoDB, the fl ushing of dirty pages from the buffer occurred when the percent- age of dirty pages exceeded a preconfi gured value  innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct . This had the  tendency to cause spikes in disk I O, and an adaptive fl ushing mechanism was introduced in InnoDB  version 1.0.4.  With adaptive fl ushing, InnoDB attempts to calculate the rate at which fl ushing needs to occur,  based on the number of dirty pages and the rate at which they have historically been fl ushed. This  allows the master thread to perform fl ushing at a much more constant rate, eliminating these spikes  in disk usage. Adaptive fl ushing — which is enabled by default — can be controlled using the  boolean innodb_adaptive_flushing ini directive.  Disk Bandwidth  Although adaptive hashing will indirectly attempt to calculate the disk I O throughput, it can occa- sionally be useful to override this. innodb_io_capacity enables you to specify the number of I O  operations per second that the disk subsystem can handle. The default is 200, and accepted values  are from 100  the previous default  upward.  NOTE   Setting this parameter incorrectly can cause signifi cant problems. In most  cases, it should be left at the default, allowing InnoDB to calculate the available  bandwidth itself and adapt to varying workloads.  Purging  The purging of data back to disk has traditionally been performed by the master thread in InnoDB.  From InnoDB version 1.1  MySQL version 5.5  onward, the option now exists for this to be carried  out by a separate thread: innodb_purge_threads. The default of 0 disables the use of a separate   c08.indd   221 c08.indd   221  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   222  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  thread, whereas a value of 1 enables it. Note that this setting applies only to garbage collection   in particular, removing unneeded entries from the undo log — innodb_write_io_threads still  controls threading when writing dirty pages out to disk .  In theory, a separate thread should improve performance. But in many situations, it simply shifts  the bottleneck from one place  queue in the thread  to another  disk contention . Still, this option is  worth knowing about, particularly for high-end systems.  Mutexes  In a multithread environment, care must be taken when threads try to simultaneously access the  same resource. In general, concurrent reading of a resource isn’t a problem. But when writing to a  resource, care must be taken to ensure that multiple threads don’t attempt to write at the same time.  In many cases, you also want to prevent read requests when writing is taking place.  InnoDB  and MySQL, in general  implements this through extensive use of mutual exclusion   mutex  locks, and, not surprisingly, write locks are often the source of bottlenecks  because  they generally also prevent other threads from reading the resource . In addition to this, the  process of initializing and destroying locks introduces some overhead, which, in some cases,  can be signifi cant.  This section focuses on the technique of spin locking and how this relates to mutexes.  Inspecting Mutexes  Mutexes in use by InnoDB can be viewed using SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX to produce output  similar to the following snippet:  +--------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------+  Type    Name                                             Status          +--------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------+  InnoDB  .. .. .. storage innobase fil fil0fil.c:1313     os_waits=111     InnoDB  .. .. .. storage innobase srv srv0srv.c:886      os_waits=12183   InnoDB  .. .. .. storage innobase thr thr0loc.c:227      os_waits=1       InnoDB  .. .. .. storage innobase mem mem0pool.c:206     os_waits=10      Previous versions of MySQL displayed more verbose output, including counts on spin locks and the  number of times a mutex had been requested. From MySQL version 5.0.33 onward, this extra infor- mation is displayed only if MySQL is compiled with UNIV_DEBUG enabled. You’ll learn more about  the os_waits column in a minute.  MySQL version 5.0.33 also hides entries relating to the buffer pool, or where os_waits is zero. The  intention here is to clean up the output, which would often run to many thousands of lines. Removal  of buffer pool mutexes is a prime candidate in this effort because they are unlikely to be the cause of  bottlenecks.  Each 16 KB block of the buffer pool has its own mutex.   Spin Locks  If a thread fails to acquire a lock, the usual procedure would be for it to sleep for a short period  before trying again. However, mutexes in InnoDB are often short-lived, and it can be more effi cient   c08.indd   222 c08.indd   222  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Tuning InnoDB  ❘  223  for the thread to repeatedly poll the mutex in the hope that it will soon become free. If the lock is  not freed within a short time, the thread sleeps.  The name spin lock  also referred to as a spin loop  comes from the polling technique. When an  InnoDB thread enters this state, the code loops through a tight set of instructions. This prevents the  operating system’s task manager from rescheduling the task  that is, causing it to sleep . The down- side, of course, is that this loop can eat away at system resources, especially if the loop delay is too  low. Modern CPUs tend to implement a PAUSE instruction, however, and InnoDB will use this where  possible to reduce resource usage.  The period between polling is controlled by innodb_spin_wait_delay, which takes a value  between zero and 232–1. The default is 6, while a value of zero disables polling.  The os_waits column of the SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX output shows the number of times that  InnoDB failed to acquire a lock through polling, and fell back on the operating system’s thread sleep- ing. Rapidly increasing values here  remember that you’re usually interested in the rate of increase,  rather than the absolute fi gure  could signify that the mutex is causing a bottleneck, and it may be  worth experimenting with raising innodb_spin_wait_delay in the hope that less threads need to  be sent to sleep.  Compression  Earlier in this chapter, you learned that the ARCHIVE and MyISAM engines support table compression.  Although compression increases CPU usage  because pages must be compressed and decompressed  as they are written or read from disk , it cuts down on the amount of data that must be transferred  to and from disk. This is generally a good compromise  because disk I O is so often the bottle- neck  — especially for read-heavy applications. Unfortunately, MyISAM’s compression support can  be used only for read-only tables, whereas ARCHIVE is something of a specialist engine, making it  unsuitable for general-purpose use.  The good news is that InnoDB also supports compression  of both tables and indexes , and for the  most part, it is transparent, not limiting the functionality of the database. In fact, the only real  restriction on compression is that you must confi gure InnoDB to use the Barracuda fi le format   the default , rather than the newer Antelope format.  The compression algorithm is based on zlib  LZ77  and is applied to both table data and  indexes — a signifi cant measure, given that table indexes can often be large. It’s also worth noting  that, where possible, MySQL keeps a copy of a compressed page in the InnoDB buffer pool in both  compressed and uncompressed form. When the pool becomes full, an LRU algorithm is once again  used to decide what to evict.   The twist is that the decision to evict compressed versus uncompressed pages is based on the  status  of the server. If the server appears to be I O-bound, uncompressed pages will be the fi rst to go    freeing up more space in which to cache pages, thus reducing disk I O . Conversely, if the server  appears to be CPU-bound, MySQL favors the eviction of compressed pages in an attempt to reduce  CPU usage. In general, this means that compression is particularly suited to machines that have  adequate CPU and plenty of memory, but relatively poor disk I O.  c08.indd   223 c08.indd   223  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   224  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  Enabling Compression  Compression is enabled on a per-table basis, by passing additional attributes to the CREATE  ALTER TABLE statements. But fi rst, you must enable support for compression in my.cnf, as shown here:  innodb_file_per_table = ON innodb_file_format = Barracuda  The KEY_BLOCK_SIZE attribute is used to control the size of compressed blocks, and, therefore, the  amount of compression to apply. Permitted values are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16  KB , but because the default  size for uncompressed InnoDB blocks is 16 KB anyway, setting a KEY_BLOCK_SIZE of 16 offers little  compression. Generally, smaller values are preferred because they result in greater compression.  However, if the compressed page size is too small to hold a complete record, errors occur   42000: Row size too large . For that reason, KEY_BLOCK_SIZEs of 1 and 2 KB are rarely used.  Because the maximum size of an InnoDB record is 8 KB, a KEY_BLOCK_SIZE of 8 KB is a safe com- promise and is the value most commonly used.  ALTER TABLE test KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8 ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED;  When the KEY_BLOCK_SIZE is specifi ed, ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED is assumed and can be omitted. If  no KEY_BLOCK_SIZE is given, it defaults to 8 KB.  Monitoring Compression  The primary means for inspecting compression statistics is via the INNODB_CMP table in the  information_schema database. This table holds counters for the number of compression   decompression operations, and the time spent on each, as shown here:  mysql> select * from information_schema.INNODB_CMP; +------+----------+----------+----------+------------+-----------+  page  compress  compress  compress  uncompress  uncompress _size  _ops      _ops_ok   _time     _ops        _time      +------+----------+----------+----------+------------+-----------+  1024         0         0         0           0          0   2048         0         0         0           0          0   4096         0         0         0           0          0   8192    891744    887177       531      232865         79  16384         0         0         0           0          0  +------+----------+----------+----------+------------+-----------+  In this example, all compressed tables are using a KEY_BLOCK_SIZE of 8, so there is no data to show  other page sizes. The remaining columns are as follows:   ➤ compression_ops — This is the number of page compressions attempted.   ➤ compression_ops_ok — This is the number of successful page compressions.   ➤ compress_time — This is the total time spent on compression  in seconds .   ➤ uncompress_ops — This is the number of page uncompressions performed.   ➤ uncompress_time — This is the total time spent uncompressing pages  in seconds .  c08.indd   224 c08.indd   224  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Working with the Query Cache  ❘  225  Because compression and uncompression are mostly CPU-based operations, relatively high   values here suggest additional CPU cores would benefi t performance. However, a high number  of  compress uncompress operations could also indicate a shortage of memory in the buffer pool,   causing pages to be written back to disk.  What about the ratio of compress_ops to compress_ops_ok, and why would these two values not  be identical? With a KEY_BLOCK_SIZE of 8 KB, MySQL will attempt to compress each 16 KB block   the size of uncompressed blocks in InnoDB  into 8 KB blocks. If this cannot be achieved, the data  must be reorganized and recompressed, resulting in multiple compression operations. The result is  an increase in compress_ops but not compress_ops_ok.  Ideally, compress_ops and compress_ops_ok should be identical, but a small difference is quite  common and not a cause for undue alarm. However, reorganization of the data wastes CPU cycles,  and you should generally strive for a successful percentage in the high 90s  compress_ops_ok  compress_ops × 100 . If the ratio is lower than this, switching block sizes may help. Or you may  want to be more selective about which tables are compressed.  As always, comparing ratios does not tell the full story, and you can also learn something by   comparing the absolute values of the columns in the INNODB_CMP table. A large number of compres- sion operations indicates that tables are updated frequently, forcing content to be recompressed and  written out. In these situations, disabling compression on the affected table may improve overall  performance. Or you can experiment with a higher compression block size. In general, compression  is much more effective when the compressed tables are light on writes and heavy on reads.  So far, you’ve seen how the two major storage engines compare, along with general tuning tips for  MySQL. In the next section, you’ll meet the query cache, MySQL’s built-in caching mechanism.  When used correctly, the query cache can be a huge benefi t, cutting load on the server and lowering  query times. But to get the most from it, you’ll fi rst need to understand how it works.  WORKING WITH THE QUERY CACHE  One of the most important features of MySQL  from a performance perspective  is the query cache.  First introduced in version 4.0.1, this is a built-in feature that can be used to cache SELECT queries  and their responses, resulting in signifi cant performance boosts for frequently run queries. It’s not  without its problems, though, and this section looks at advantages and disadvantages of using the  cache, along with ways to monitor and manage it.  Understanding How the Query Cache Works  The query cache intercepts incoming SELECT queries and compares them against the list of queries  in its cache. If it fi nds a match, the cached response is returned. If not, the query is executed as nor- mal, and the response is stored in the cache  usually, but there are exceptions . The result is that pre- viously seen queries can be fetched directly from the cache, saving MySQL considerable work. Let’s  look at an example:  c08.indd   225 c08.indd   225  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   226  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  mysql> SELECT username FROM user GROUP BY usergroupid LIMIT 0,3; +-----------+  username   +-----------+  Unknown     ian         dave       +-----------+ 3 rows in set  2.25 sec   mysql> SELECT username FROM user GROUP BY usergroupid LIMIT 0,3; +-----------+  username   +-----------+  Unknown     ian         dave       +-----------+ 3 rows in set  0.00 sec   The fi rst time this query was run, the cache was unprimed, and MySQL took 2.25 seconds to return  the result. The second time around, the query cache delivered the response, and execution time was  virtual insignifi cant.  As mentioned, MySQL will cache only SELECT queries. Specifi cally, it checks  in a case-insensitive  manner  if the query begins with the string "SELECT". It used to be that any leading spaces or com- ments in SELECT queries would fool MySQL into not caching, but this is now  as of MySQL version  5.0  no longer an issue. It’s still worth remembering, though, in case you fi nd yourself using an older  version of MySQL.  A closely related gotcha is that the query cache will return a result from the cache only if the SELECT  query is identical to a previously cached SELECT. Using the earlier example, let’s see what happens if  FROM is changed to from:  mysql> SELECT username from user GROUP BY usergroupid LIMIT 0,3; +-----------+  username   +-----------+  Unknown     ian         dave       +-----------+ 3 rows in set  1.43 sec   Although the execution time is less than the original 2.25 seconds, this can be attributed to other  factors  such as table caching, disk contention, and so on , and isn’t the result of query caching.  This behavior isn’t surprising. With any other language, you wouldn’t expect the two strings that  differed like this to be considered identical, and MySQL is no different. It’s worth remembering,  though, especially in dynamically constructed queries, where variations in the amount of whitespace  often occur and aren’t usually considered an issue.  c08.indd   226 c08.indd   226  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Working with the Query Cache  ❘  227  Conﬁ guring the Query Cache  The fi rst step in confi guring the query cache is to check if MySQL has been compiled with query  cache support, as shown here:  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_query_cache'; +------------------+-------+  Variable_name     Value  +------------------+-------+  have_query_cache  YES    +------------------+-------+ 1 row in set  0.00 sec   This says nothing about whether the cache is enabled, but simply that your copy of MySQL has  query cache support built in. To check if the cache is enabled and running, you must check for  nonzero settings for both query_cache_type  which governs the type of caching used  and  query_cache_size  which controls the size . A zero-sized cache means the cache is effectively  disabled. Following is an example:  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'query_cache_type'; +------------------+-------+  Variable_name     Value  +------------------+-------+  query_cache_type  ON     +------------------+-------+  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'query_cache_size'; +------------------+----------+  Variable_name     Value     +------------------+----------+  query_cache_size  33554432  +------------------+----------+  In this example, you can see that the cache is ON and has a maximum size of 32 MB. Both of these  can be confi gured via my.cnf, along with a number of other options. Let’s take a look at some of  these options.  query_cache_size  Given how useful the query cache can be, it seems logical to set query_cache_size as large as  memory permits. Unfortunately, this can actually be counterproductive. With a large cache, MySQL  ends up spending a signifi cant amount of time simply sorting and maintaining the cache.   How large is too large? There’s no simple answer. The average size of cached queries is one factor   a handful of large queries are easier to manage than many smaller ones , as is how well utilized the  query cache is. If your web application can make extensive use of the query cache, you’ll be willing  for MySQL to spend more time on cache management than on an application that can seldom utilize  the query cache.  c08.indd   227 c08.indd   227  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   228  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  query_cache_type  Using query_cache_type, you can set one of two types of query cache. The most common  equiva- lent to setting this variable to 1  is a cache-by-default approach, where all SELECT queries will be  cached, unless you specifi cally ask MySQL not to cache them by starting the query SELECT SQL_NO_ CACHE. A value of 2 causes an on-demand method of caching, with queries being considered only as  candidates for caching if they begin with SELECT SQL_CACHE.  This poses the question, “Why would you not want to cache?” As you shall see soon, there are actu- ally several good reasons.  query_cache_limit  You use query_cache_limit to set the maximum size for cached queries, with results over this size  not being cached. The justifi cation here is that you probably don’t want a single, huge query fi lling  up the cache. However, if you fi nd that your query cache is under-performing, it may be that you  have a lot of large queries that are too large to be cached. In that case, raising this value  the default  is 1 MB  should help.  query_cache_wlock_invalidate  The query_cache_wlock_invalidate option causes the locking of a table used for writing to inval- idate all query cache entries relating to the table. You’ll learn more about this in a minute.  query_cache_min_res_unit  MySQL allocates memory to the query cache on demand, in small chunks. Because the size of a  result set is not known in advance  because the results of a query are fed into the cache , MySQL  keeps allocating chunks of memory as needed. Allocating memory is somewhat expensive, and you  can use query_cache_min_res_unit to increase performance a little by increasing the size of these  chunks  hence, reducing the number of calls .  You needn’t worry about the tail end of the query resulting in the waste of an entire block of memory  because MySQL prunes the last block down to the required size after the response is complete.  However, there is the related problem of fragmentation — something you would be all too familiar  with if you were a Microsoft Windows user in the 1990s when disk fragmentation was a regular issue.  With the query cache, this results in small regions of memory that are effectively wasted because  they are not big enough to hold a cached result. Although this can be a problem on any MySQL  server, it is a particular concern when memory is allocated in large chunks  that is, when query_ cache_min_res_unit is increased . For this reason, blindly raising this value isn’t a good idea.  Shortly, you’ll see how to measure the amount of fragmentation, and how to decide on a suitable  size for query_cache_min_res_unit.  Inspecting the Cache  Your best hope to set suitable values for the cache size, limit, and memory units is to inspect the  cache during normal day-to-day running. It goes without saying that this is site-specifi c and should  be done in conditions as close to the real world as possible.  c08.indd   228 c08.indd   228  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Working with the Query Cache  ❘  229  A handful of cache stats can be obtained from MySQL using the SHOW STATUS command, as  shown here:  mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Qcache%'; +-------------------------+-----------+  Variable_name            Value      +-------------------------+-----------+  Qcache_free_blocks       1991        Qcache_free_memory       6847496     Qcache_hits              726951573   Qcache_inserts           68370986    Qcache_lowmem_prunes     11224754    Qcache_not_cached        2995801     Qcache_queries_in_cache  3665        Qcache_total_blocks      12205      +-------------------------+-----------+  The names of these variables should be self-explanatory but following are some brief descriptions:   ➤ Qcache_free_blocks — This shows the number of free memory blocks in the cache.   ➤ Qcache_free_memory — This shows the amount of free memory.   ➤ Qcache_hits — This shows how many hits there have been on the cache.   ➤ Qcache_inserts — This shows the number of queries inserted into the cache.   ➤ Qcache_lowmem_prunes — This lists the number of entries that were removed from the   cache because of a lack of memory.   ➤ Qcache_not_cached — This lists the number of queries that were not cached, perhaps   because of a lack of memory, or because they simply weren’t cacheable.   ➤ Qcache_queries_in_cache — This is the number of queries in the cache.   ➤ Qcache_total_blocks — This is the total number of memory blocks in the cache.  In addition, the following counters are helpful:  mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'com_select'; +---------------+--------+  Variable_name  Value   +---------------+--------+  Com_select     71940007  +---------------+--------+  mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'com_insert'; +---------------+---------+  Variable_name  Value    +---------------+---------+  Com_insert     8619823  +---------------+---------+  c08.indd   229 c08.indd   229  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   230  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'com_update'; +---------------+----------+  Variable_name  Value     +---------------+----------+  Com_update     10598217  +---------------+----------+  mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'com_delete'; +---------------+--------+  Variable_name  Value   +---------------+--------+  Com_delete     524326  +---------------+--------+  These show the number of SELECTs, INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs performed.  All variables are reset when MySQL is started, so they may not provide an accurate summary  until MySQL has been running for some time  anywhere between a few hours to a couple of days,  depending on how busy your sites are .  Armed with this data, you can begin to analyze how your cache is performing.  The most obvious thing to check fi rst is how full your cache is, as shown by Qcache_free_memory  blocks. If the cache is full, you can consider increasing its size  via query_cache_size, but see the  earlier warning about making the cache too big . Conversely, if little is cached, you can save some  memory by decreasing the size.  It would be worth exploring why the cache is under-utilized, too. Is  it because your highly effi cient client-side code is taking the strain off MySQL, or are too many of  your queries noncacheable?   Cache Size  Cache Hit Rate  com_select is incremented only when a SELECT query is actually performed — not when a SELECT  query is answered by the cache. Thus, you can compare com_select to Qcache_hits to determine  the extent to which the cache is utilized. The following equation gives you the percentage of SELECT  queries that were handled by the cache:    qcache_hits   qcache_hits + com_select   * 100  The fi gures here yield a healthy hit rate of 91 percent.  There’s no pat answer for what sort of hit rate you should be striving for because this equation  doesn’t take into consideration the level of saving. Even a 25 percent hit rate may offer substantial  performance gains, if the queries that are cached are particularly intensive ones. Again, ratios  in  this case, the ratio of cache hits over com_selects  can be a somewhat over-simplifi cation, and you  should think carefully before attaching too much signifi cance to them.  Invalidation  What happens if the data in your tables changes? Will MySQL continue to serve the now stale data  from the query cache?   c08.indd   230 c08.indd   230  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Working with the Query Cache  ❘  231  Although this is how some caches operate, it’s not the case with MySQL. Any actions that cause  the structure or contents of a table to be altered  for example, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on  cause all  entries in the cache that reference that table to be immediately invalidated. Often, this is overkill,  but that’s the way MySQL does it.  Invalidation is one of the main causes of poor cache performance. Consider a busy web forum where  posts are held in a single database table. MySQL will be receiving many SELECT queries on this table  as users browse the forum and read posts. It may seem advantageous to cache as many of these que- ries possible, but as soon as someone submits an individual post, MySQL receives an INSERT query  on the table, and suddenly every cache entry referencing that table has become invalid.   If the post table contains a counter fi eld to indicate how many times a particular post has been  viewed, the situation is even worse. This time, merely viewing the post is enough to send an UPDATE  query, invalidating the cache. Most likely, the web code will perform a SELECT to retrieve the post,  immediately followed by an UPDATE to increment the counter, and the query will be in the cache for  only a fraction of a second. When you take into account the cost of cache management, this scenario  actually ends up worse than no caching at all!  One way to diagnose high levels of invalidation is to look at Qcache_inserts  the number of queries  inserted into the cache  — in particular, comparing this to Qcache_queries_in_cache, Qcache_ lowmem_prune and com_select. In the earlier example  which, incidentally, was taken from a live  server that had been running for approximately 3 months , 68,370,986 queries had been inserted  into the cache. Of these, 11,224,754 had been removed because of lack of memory. At the time, an  inspection of the counters revealed that there were 3,665 queries in the cache. That leaves 57,142,567   68,370,986 – 11,224,754 – 3,665  queries that were removed from the cache because of invalidation.  Although these fi gures look bleak, they don’t tell the full story. In situations in which many queries  spend only a short amount of time in the cache before being invalidated, performance can suffer.  But if the same percentage of queries is invalidated after, say, 12 hours in the cache, you’d probably  be quite happy with this. It all depends on how long the query stays in the cache.  At the beginning of this section, you learned that the query_cache_wlock_invalidate setting  has the power to cause cache invalidation when a table is locked for writing. Does this mean you  can prevent invalidation altogether by turning this setting off? Sadly, the answer is “no” because  write-lock invalidation is somewhat more subtle than this. Invalidation always occurs when a table  is written to. query_cache_write_lock simply offers some control over the point at which the   invalidation occurs.  With the option turned off, cache entries will be invalidated after the INSERT or UPDATE has com- pleted. With the option turned on, they become invalid as soon as the table is locked for writing. It’s  generally best to leave this option disabled. Table locking is enough of a nuisance as it is, without  compounding it.   Fragmentation and query_cache_min_res_unit  As previously mentioned, increasing the query_cache_min_res_unit size is something of a double- edged sword — speeding up the process of memory allocation but increasing the risk of fragmenta- tion. Using the Qcache_* statistics, though, you can make a reasonably well-informed estimate as to  a suitable size.   c08.indd   231 c08.indd   231  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   232  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  Subtracting Qcache_free_memory from the query_cache_size  as set in my.cnf  gives you the  amount of memory in use by the query cache. If you then divide this fi gure by the number of queries  in the cache  Qcache_queries_in_cache , you have an average size for each query. Let’s try it on  some sample data:  SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'query_cache_size'; +------------------+----------+  Variable_name     Value     +------------------+----------+  query_cache_size  33554432  +------------------+----------+  33554432 – 6847496  ¸ 3665  = 8968  So, on average, each query takes up just more than 8 KB of space in the cache. Perhaps you should  be increasing your value of query_cache_min_res_unit from the 4 KB default.  The problem here is that this fi gure is only an average. It could be the case that the vast majority of  queries fi t nicely into the default 4 KB block size, and that a handful of large queries are skewing  the average up. If this were the case, raising min_res_unit would be a mistake. Perhaps, instead,  you should be lowering query_cache_limit to prevent these huge queries from being cached — not  because of concern over the performance penalty of allocating memory in small blocks, but because  you may not want them taking up precious cache space. It depends on how often you expect a cache  hit on these large queries.  Despite these caveats, the calculations suggest that raising query_cache_min_res_unit to a little  more than 8 KB would certainly be worth trying. However, only with knowledge of the queries  being executed can you make an educated decision.  The reason for being cautious about raising query_cache_min_res_unit is that it will likely cause  an increase in fragmentation. You can gauge the level of fragmentation by looking at the ratio of  free blocks to total blocks:   Qcache_free_blocks   Qcache_total_blocks  * 100  This example data gives a fairly respectable fi gure of 16 percent. Values of approximately 10 percent  to 20 percent are common and are not a cause for undue alarm.  When high levels of fragmentation exist, the FLUSH query cache command can be used to  defragment the cache. Despite the slightly misleading name, this does not remove entries from the  cache — if you ever want to do that, use RESET query cache.  The Downsides of Query Caching  As already hinted, the query cache is far from perfect, and there may be situations in which best per- formance can be achieved by turning it off.  One source of problems is the additional overhead imposed by enabling the cache. For each incom- ing SELECT query, MySQL must fi rst check the cache for a match. If none is found, the query is  executed as normal, and, if the query is cachable, the result is then inserted into the cache. Although  this overhead is fairly low, and, in most cases, an acceptable penalty for using the cache, it is waste- ful in situations in which cache hits are low.  c08.indd   232 c08.indd   232  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Working with the Query Cache  ❘  233  This leads to the next big problem: invalidation. You’ve already learned that writing to a table  causes cache entries that reference the table to be invalidated. When this happens, the cache is tem- porarily locked, and nothing can read from it. So, not only does MySQL waste time with house- keeping, it makes every other query wait until it has fi nished.  Caching Modes  An ideal situation would be one in which you simply didn’t cache queries that you knew  or sus- pected  would be quickly invalidated. If you have the query_cache_type set at 1  cache everything  by default , you can disable caching on a per-query basis by adding SQL_NO_CACHE to the query:  SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE foo FROM bar  Or if you choose to disable caching by default  by setting query_cache_type to 2 , caching can be  enabled on a per-query basis with the following:  SELECT SQL_CACHE foo FROM bar  Armed with this, you can now sift through your web code, deciding on a case-by-case basis whether  to cache. Remember, though, the aim is not to prevent invalidations completely but merely to pre- vent situations in which invalidation occurs so quickly that caching is pointless — and this is some- what subjective.  Nondeterministic Queries  Another shortcoming of the query cache  actually, it’s not a shortcoming — it makes perfect sense  is  that nondeterministic queries cannot be cached. Prime examples of these are the RAND  , NOW  , and  CURRENT_DATE   functions — any query using these will not be cached.  You can often get around this by performing the function in your scripting language instead. For  example, consider the following PHP snippet:  $r1 = mysql_query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE registered = CURRENT_DATE  " ;  This query won’t be cached, but if you rewrite it to the following, it will be cached by MySQL:  $r1 = mysql_query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE registered = '" . date "Y-m-d"  . '" ;  For queries that use RAND  , there probably isn’t much you can do. You could fetch the entire data  set and then choose entries from it at random. But this is unlikely to give an overall performance  boost, unless your query is particularly complex.  In which case, the savings from caching might just  outweigh the cost of fetching the entire data set and selecting random entries from it.  Even then, the  data set might exceed query_cache_limit.  On the subject of time and date stamps, can you spot the reason why it would probably be pointless  to change a query such as the following  again, with PHP as the scripting language ?  $r1 = mysql_query "SELECT  username FROM users WHERE      account_expires < NOW  " ;  c08.indd   233 c08.indd   233  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   234  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  You could change this query to the following:  $r1 = mysql_query "SELECT  username FROM users WHERE      account_expires < '" . date "Y-m-d H:i:s"  . "'" ;  Although MySQL will cache the latter, the precision of the date stamp means that if you execute the  query again, a second later, the date stamp will have changed, and the query won’t match the previ- ously cached one. You end up fi lling the cache with queries that you know will never be executed  again.  Sometimes situations like these can be avoided by rethinking the WHERE clause a little.  In this  example, lower the precision of the date stamp so that if the code is run a short while later, the  data stamp is still the same.  Failing that, you can use SQL_NO_CACHE or SQL_CACHE to avoid  pointless caching.  You’ve seen how powerful the query cache can be when used properly, but there is also a lot to  discover about SQL itself  or at least the MySQL implementation of SQL . In the next  section,  you’ll learn how indexing can be used to speed up queries by several orders of magnitude,  and how tools such as EXPLAIN and the slow query log can be used to fi nd bottlenecks in your   database queries.  OPTIMIZING SQL  So far, this discussion has focused on tuning the MySQL application. You’ve learned how MySQL  and individual storage engines interact with the underlying operating system, and how system  administrators can ensure harmony between the operating system and MySQL.  Let’s now focus on the second key area of MySQL performance tuning: the queries. Again, there  is often a huge scope for improvement, but as a system administrator, the changes aren’t always  so easy to implement. Rather than simply tweaking a few buffer sizes in my.cnf, you may edit or  rewrite large portions of badly written applications to change the way in which they interact with  MySQL.  EXPLAIN Explained  MySQL’s EXPLAIN command offers insight into how MySQL executes queries, and is invaluable  when trying to diagnose why a query runs slowly, or not as expected. To use it, simply prepend  EXPLAIN to the beginning of a SELECT query, as shown here:  mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM wp_users WHERE user_login LIKE 'pete%'\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: wp_users          type: range possible_keys: user_login_key           key: user_login_key       key_len: 180  c08.indd   234 c08.indd   234  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  235            ref: NULL          rows: 1         Extra: Using where  The output columns are as follows:  unique ID.  will always be SIMPLE.   ➤ id — This is the ID of the SELECT query. If the query contains subqueries, each will have a    ➤ select_type — For simple select queries  that is, those not using UNION or subqueries , this    ➤ table — This is the table being operated on.   ➤ type — This is the join type.   ➤ possible_keys — This is a list of indexes that MySQL has found to choose from.   ➤ key — This is the actual index that MySQL decided to use.   ➤ key_len — This is the length of the key being used.   ➤ ref — This is either the name of the columns that MySQL compares to the index given in   key, or to denote that a constant is being searched for.   ➤ rows — This is the number of rows retrieved for examination.   ➤ Extra — This provides additional information about how MySQL handles the query.  Some of these columns are important enough to warrant a more detailed discussion. Let’s start with  select_type.  select_type  Aside from SIMPLE, there are eight other possible values for this column:   ➤ PRIMARY — This is the main SELECT query in statements containing subqueries.   ➤ UNION — This shows SELECT queries in a UNION other than the fi rst SELECT.   ➤ DEPENDENT UNION — In UNIONs, this shows SELECT statements  other than the fi rst  that are   dependent on the main query.   ➤ UNION RESULT — This is the result of a UNION.   ➤ SUBQUERY — This shows any SELECT statements that are part of a subquery.   ➤ DEPENDENT SUBQUERY — This shows SELECT statements in a subquery that are dependent   on the main query.   ➤ DERIVED — This shows that the table is derived from a subquery.   ➤ UNCACHEABLE SUBQUERY — This shows that the results of the subquery cannot be cached   and, hence, must be re-evaluated each time  for each row of the main query .  SIMPLE select_types are the most common, but the others do crop up regularly in more compli- cated queries.  c08.indd   235 c08.indd   235  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   236  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  type  The next column of special note is the type  of join , of which there are a dozen possible values.  The type  of join  used can have a big effect on performance, and when debugging a slow query, it’s  always worth checking that MySQL uses the type of join you would expect. Use of the word “join”  is a little confusing here and refers to MySQL’s method of executing queries — it doesn’t imply that  multiple tables are joined together in the SQL sense.  Following are the join types  listed in order from best performance to worst performance :   ➤ system  — The table is an in-memory system table containing just one row, so there is little   work to be done.   ➤ const — This is used when a PRIMARY or UNIQUE is compared to a constant value, resulting   on only one row  or no rows  being returned. Following is an example:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE ID=3  This assumes that the ID column is unique.   ➤ eq_ref  — This occurs in join queries when a unique non-null index  or primary index    matches a single row of the second table, for each result row of the fi rst table. Consider the  following example:  SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.indexed_column = t2.column  In this situation, eq_ref can  and will  be used for t1. eq_ref only when using the equality  operator  = .    ➤ ref — Almost identical to eq_ref, a ref access type occurs when multiple matches occur   on the table. This usually occurs because the index is not unique  and does not contain null  values . Because multiple rows are returned, this join type isn’t as desirable as eq_ref.   ➤ ref_or_null — This is identical to ref, except null values occur in the index.   ➤ full_text — The join occurs on a full text index  MyISAM only .   ➤ index_merge — Multiple indexes can be merged and used.  You’ll learn more about this   later in the “Indexing” section.    ➤ unique_subquery — This is similar to ref but for unique indexes in subqueries.   ➤ index_subquery — This is identical to unique_subquery but for nonunique indexes in   subqueries.   ➤ range — This indicates that a range of rows will be returned, such as the following:  SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100;  This is still an improvement on a plain index join because the number of rows is limited.   ➤ index — A full scan of the index is required. This is the default when none of the previously   listed join types are suitable.  c08.indd   236 c08.indd   236  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  237   ➤ ALL — This requires a full scan of the data in the table and happens when searching against  an unindexed column. In these situations, performance is usually poor  worsening dramati- cally as the size of the table increases .  That’s a lot of different join types, but the majority of the time, you’ll encounter only eq_ref, ref,  range, and index. All join types are particularly poor performers but are usually easily fi xed  through appropriate indexing.  Extra  As previously mentioned, the Extra column provides additional information about the query. As  of this writing, 25 different values can appear in this column. Rather than provide an exhaustive  list of these, let’s concentrate on the most important ones. You can fi nd the complete list in the  online MySQL documentation  http:  dev.mysql.com doc refman 5.6 en  explain-output.html .   ➤ Using where — The presence of a WHERE clause is limiting the number of rows matched.   Usually, this is what you want, rather than MySQL scanning all rows in the table.   ➤ Using filesort — This is something of a misnomer because it doesn’t imply the use of   fi les. Rather, it occurs when a sort on a nonindexed column is performed. You’ll learn more  about ORDER BY and GROUP BY optimization in the upcoming section, “Indexing.”   ➤ Using index — This occurs when only the data from indexed columns is required. In these  situations, the query can be answered solely by searching the index, with no need to search  the row  or for MyISAM, the data fi le .   ➤ Using temporary — A temporary table is used to hold the results. Typically, this is needed   when performing a GROUP BY and ORDER BY. Temporary tables aren’t a problem by them- selves, but if a temporary table is written to disk  for example, because it is too big for  memory , performance will suffer.  As you can see, the EXPLAIN command can be an incredibly useful tool.  The Slow Query Log  MySQL offers the capability to log all queries that take longer than a user-defi ned number of sec- onds to run, and this log can be invaluable when debugging slow applications. Even when you’re not  aware of any particular slowdown, it can be useful to leave the slow query log enabled, and periodi- cally review it — you just might be surprised.  Enabling the Log  The my.cnf confi guration options are as follows:  long_query_time = 5 slow_query_log = 1 slow_query_log_file =  var log mysql slow-queries.log  c08.indd   237 c08.indd   237  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   238  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  This logs any query taking more than 5 seconds to execute to  var log mysql slow-queries .log.  Note that you may fi rst need to create and set appropriate ownerships on this fi le.  It’s worth  noting that query execution time does not include the time taken to acquire table locks. If a query  regularly runs slowly because of a high level of locking, it will not be logged.  Optionally, you can also restrict the slow query log to those queries that cause more than a certain  number of rows to be examined, as shown here:  min_examined_row_limit = 500  NOTE   This feature was introduced in MySQL version 5.5.  Inspecting the Slow Query Log  An example entry for a real-world slow query log follows. In addition to the query, you see informa- tion on the user that executed it, the date-time stamp, the time taken for the query to run, and the  number of rows examined.   Time: 110422  4:56:28  User@Host: forums[forums] @ localhost []  Query_time: 10.119974  Lock_time: 0.000065 Rows_sent: 1  Rows_examined: 1191 SET timestamp=1303444588; SELECT COUNT *  AS posts                 FROM post AS post                 WHERE threadid = 83035 AND visible = 1                 AND dateline <= 1194968540;  It’s worth remembering that an entry in the slow query log does not mean that the query is inherently  slow, merely that it executed slowly on this particular occasion. This could be caused by other factors,  such as the number of concurrent clients running queries against the database, another client running a  particularly CPU-intensive query, high load on the server caused by the generation of backups, or even  because MySQL’s caches have not been primed  for example, because MySQL hasn’t been running long .   Whenever you spot a slow query, you should generally repeat the query at the MySQL CLI — having  fi rst inspected the operating system and MySQL’s process lists  SHOW PROCESSLIST  — before decid- ing if it is a cause for concern.  mysqldumpslow  For all but the smallest slow query logs, manually reviewing the log fi le can be tedious. Fortunately,  MySQL ships with a useful tool that can analyze such logs. mysqldumpslow counts the number of  occurrences of each query in the log, allowing you to see at a glance the worst offenders.  Queries Not Using Indexes  Indexes  as you’ll soon see  play such an important part in MySQL, that an option exists to cause  any queries that don’t use indexes to be written to the slow query log.  log-queries-not-using-indexes = 1  c08.indd   238 c08.indd   238  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  239  Actually, that’s not entirely true. With this option enabled, MySQL actually logs any queries that  cause all rows in the table to be retrieved. Mostly, this is a result of no suitable index being found,  but occasionally it is because the query actually returns all rows of the table. This is a subtle point,  but worth remembering.  Indexing  Probably the single biggest way to improve the performance of SELECT queries is through the use  of appropriate indexing.  Note the use of the word “appropriate.” As you’ll see later, in the section,  “When Not to Index,” indexing everything in sight is counter-productive.  Much like a book, where  an index saves you from looking through every page of the book, indexes on columns saves MySQL  from examining every record in a table. Just as the index of a book tells you the page to go to, a  database index tells MySQL the position of the data on the disk to jump to.  The simplest way to create an index on an existing table is through the alter command, as  shown here:  alter table regions add index country ;  This adds an index on the country column of the regions table. You can view the existing indexes  with describe, as shown here:  mysql> describe regions; +-----------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+  Field      Type              Null  Key  Default  Extra           +-----------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+  regionId   int 10  unsigned  NO    PRI  NULL     auto_increment   country    char 2            NO    MUL                            name       varchar 64        NO                                   district   varchar 64        NO                                  +-----------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+  The Key fi eld of the output shows the index type  if any . For the country index, it’s MUL  multiple ,  meaning that multiple occurrences of the same value are permitted — that is, the index does not  require that values in this column be unique. By contrast, the existing index on regionID is PRI   primary , a special type that enforces uniqueness on data in the column. You’ll learn more about  primary indexes in a minute.  Following are other possible index types:   ➤ UNI  unique  — This requires that all values in the column be unique. For columns that   always hold unique values  such as the Social Security number of an employee , using UNI  over MUL offers a performance increase.   ➤ FUL  full-text  — This is a MyISAM-specifi c index type, allowing for fast string matching   using MATCH or AGAINST.  Specifying the index type is as simple as adding it to the previous alter query:  alter table regions add index uni  country ;  c08.indd   239 c08.indd   239  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   240  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  Primary Indexes  The primary index is special. Only one primary index may exist in a table, and the column indexed  must contain unique values. The most common technique is to create an auto-incrementing inte- ger column  regionId in the example  and assign a primary key to that, or use a Universal Unique  Identifi er  UUID . But you’re free to not create a primary key at all if you want.  In MyISAM, indexes are stored in a B-tree structure in a separate fi le  with the .MYI extension in  MySQL’s data directory . This causes a slight performance overhead because MySQL must fi rst scan  the index and then scan the data to the offset given in the index. This is minor overhead, though,  and is usually easily compensated for by the improvement in performance provided by using indexes.  With InnoDB, the primary key is stored alongside secondary keys. So, if the table contains secondary  keys, it pays to keep the primary index small — preferably an integer.  Clustered Indexes  InnoDB internally uses clustered indexes, which exist in the same page as the data they reference.  This makes lookups on the clustered index fast because the disk heads are already in the correct  location.  Compare this with MyISAM, where the disk must fi rst seek to the entry in the index fi le,  and then to the entry in the data fi le.   Only one clustered index is permitted for a table, and InnoDB defaults to using the primary key.  If no primary key is set on the table, the fi rst unique index is used. If there are no unique indexes,  InnoDB creates a hidden, auto-incrementing numeric column and assigns a primary key to this.  All other indexes in InnoDB tables are nonclustered, secondary indexes. These indexes contain  the primary index column for the row, allowing InnoDB to then look up this primary index. This  two-step process is similar to how MyISAM handles indexes but is slightly slower. This is the rea- son why there is a gap in performance between primary and secondary lookups in InnoDB  and  why the primary key is of special importance . In MyISAM, there is no difference in performance  between different index types, and the primary key holds no particular importance.  Which Columns to Index?  In general, you want to place indexes on columns that are frequently used for SELECT, GROUP, ORDER,  and join. Specifi cally, MySQL uses indexes  where they exist  in the following situations:   ➤ Comparison operators  =, >,  =, <=, IF NULL, and BETWEEN    ➤ LIKE clauses that do not begin with a wildcard   ➤ Table joins   ➤ ORDER BY and GROUP BY   ➤ MAX   and MIN    Thus, all the following queries would make use of any index that exists on the mycolumn column:  SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn=5 SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn >5 AND mycolumn < 10 SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn LIKE 'something%';  c08.indd   240 c08.indd   240  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  241  SELECT * FROM mytable, myothertable WHERE mytable.mycolumn = myothertable.userID SELECT * FROM mytable ORDER BY mycolumn DESC SELECT MIN mycolumn  FROM mytable  If MySQL decides that using an index will probably result in more than a certain percentage of the  table being returned  currently approximately 30 percent, but the exact value has varied between  releases , it will ignore the index and perform a full table scan because this linear disk access will be  faster than repeatedly seeking to different points of the data.  HEAP tables are also handled slightly differently, and indexes won’t be used for ORDER BY clauses, or  comparisons that don’t use the equality operator.  Let’s return to the regions table of the earlier example. This was actually part of a real estate search  portal and mapped various locations around the world to the country they belonged to. The table  listing each property included a regionId column, corresponding to an entry in the regions table.  Given that joining the two tables on the regionId will likely be such a common task, it makes per- fect sense that the regionID column of region be indexed. But what about the other three columns  in this table? If the application enables the end user to view all properties in a particular country or  region, it makes sense to index these columns, too. Let’s use EXPLAIN to show how MySQL would  handle a SELECT against one of these columns, both with and without indexes.  mysql> explain select regionId from regions where country="UK"\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: regions          type: ALL possible_keys: NULL           key: NULL       key_len: NULL           ref: NULL          rows: 170         Extra: Using where  Without an index on country, MySQL must scan all 170 rows of the table. Now, add an index and  rerun the query:  mysql> alter table regions add index country ; mysql> explain select regionId from regions where country="UK"\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: regions          type: ref possible_keys: country           key: country       key_len: 67           ref: const          rows: 19         Extra: Using where  This time, MySQL can immediately ignore the 151 rows where the country is not "UK".  c08.indd   241 c08.indd   241  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   242  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  One slightly lesser-known feature of indexes is that MySQL uses only a maximum of one per table  in most cases. Consider the following example:  mysql> alter table regions add index  region ; mysql> explain SELECT regionId FROM regions WHERE country="UK" AND       region="North East"\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: regions          type: ref possible_keys: region,country           key: region       key_len: 67           ref: const          rows: 4         Extra: Using where  The possible_keys column shows that MySQL has correctly identifi ed that both the region and  country columns contain indexes, but that it ultimately chose to use the index on region. The  reason lies in the number of rows left to examine. MySQL calculated that using the region index  would result in 4 rows to scan, and using the country index would have resulted in 19. As you  would expect, only one row of the table matches both country="UK" and region="North East",  and scanning 4 rows to fi nd this match is a lot faster than scanning 19.  MySQL version 5 introduced changes that enable multiple keys to be used in some circumstances.  When range scans are used on multiple indexed columns, MySQL scans using the indexes of each  and then merge the results. This is the index_merge method mentioned previously:  mysql> explain SELECT regionId FROM regions WHERE country="UK"      or region="North East"\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: regions          type: index_merge possible_keys: region,country           key: country,region       key_len: 67,67           ref: NULL          rows: 13         Extra: Using union country,region ; Using where  NOTE   Both indexes are listed in the key column, and the Extra information  shows that a union was used.  c08.indd   242 c08.indd   242  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  243  Composite Indexes  The solution to the problem of searching on multiple indexes in a table can be solved through the  use of composite indexes  also referred to as multiple column indexes . As the name suggests, these  are indexes that span two or more columns, or column prefi xes.  Composite indexes are ideally suited for situations in which SELECT queries will regularly be per- formed against a particular combination of columns. Going back to the real estate example, you can  see that most queries will either specify country, or country and region in the WHERE clause. So, a  composite index on country and region seems obvious. The syntax is simply as follows:  ALTER TABLE regions ADD INDEX countryregion  country, region ;   Of course, you can call the index whatever you like.   Rerunning the earlier query, you can see that MySQL now fi nds three possible indexes to use and  chooses the newly created composite index:  Does this mean you can now remove the indexes on region and country because both exist in the  composite index? Let’s try the following:  mysql> explain select regionId FROM regions WHERE country="UK"      and region="North East"\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: regions          type: ref possible_keys: region,country,countryregion           key: countryregion       key_len: 134           ref: const,const          rows: 3         Extra: Using where  mysql> ALTER TABLE regions DROP INDEX country; mysql> ALTER TABLE regions DROP INDEX region; mysql> explain SELECT regionId FROM regions WHERE country="UK"\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: regions          type: ref possible_keys: countryregion           key: countryregion       key_len: 67           ref: const          rows: 9         Extra: Using where  c08.indd   243 c08.indd   243  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   244  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  mysql> explain SELECT regionId FROM regions WHERE region="North East"\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: regions          type: ALL possible_keys: NULL           key: NULL       key_len: NULL           ref: NULL          rows: 17         Extra: Using where  Unfortunately, things didn’t go as hoped. Selecting on country still ran as expected, but selecting on  region failed to utilize the countryregion index.  The reason centers on the order of the columns in the index. In this example, country was put  fi rst, followed by region. This allows MySQL to utilize the index when searching on country, or  country and region, but not just on region. In this example, this actually makes perfect sense.  Sometimes you’ll want to search on just country; other times, you’ll want to search on country and  region. But you are unlikely to want to search on just region.  Sometimes things aren’t this clear-cut. Don’t be afraid to duplicate columns across composite and  noncomposite indexes if the situation warrants it. But remember to think carefully about the order  of columns in a composite index, and remember that indexes create overhead.  Preﬁ x Indexes  Indexes take up disk space, and it is preferable to keep index sizes as small as possible because it  reduces disk seek times and I O, and allows more of the index to fi t in the key buffer. MySQL sup- ports prefi x indexes  not to be confused with partial indexes — a feature not supported by MySQL ,  in which only the beginning or end of a column’s value is indexed  with the former being the most  common . Prefi x indexes can greatly reduce the size of an index but can also limit their effectiveness,  and care must often be taken to fi nd a happy middle ground.  The ideal length for a prefi x is one that keeps the index size low but still maintains enough unique- ness to limit the number of rows matched. For a column with a UNIQUE index on it, it isn’t always  possible  or preferable  to maintain that uniqueness in the prefi x, and the index type may need to be  changed to MULTIPLE.  Consider a table containing information on books. There are columns for the book’s title, author,  publisher, and publication date. Say, you will often be searching on title, so you add an index on  this column. But rather than indexing the whole column  which could take up a lot of space, given  the number of characters in many book titles , what if you just index the fi rst x number of charac- ters? This will almost certainly decrease the level of uniqueness but will also reduce the index size  considerably.  For this example, load in a list of 31,416 book titles from Project Gutenberg  www.gutenberg.org .  c08.indd   244 c08.indd   244  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  245  Now, count the number of distinct titles to get an idea of the current level of uniqueness.  mysql> select count *  from books; +----------+  count *   +----------+     31416  +----------+  mysql> SELECT COUNT DISTINCT  title   FROM books; +-------------------------+  COUNT DISTINCT  title    +-------------------------+                    30510  +-------------------------+  You can calculate the cardinality by dividing the total number of unique entries by the total number  of rows. In this case, you get a value of 0.97  the maximum value, of course, will be 1 , indicating a  high level of uniqueness.  What if you index just the fi rst fi ve characters of the title?  mysql> SELECT COUNT DISTINCT  left title,5    FROM books; +---------------------------------+  COUNT DISTINCT  left title,5     +---------------------------------+                             8376  +---------------------------------+  This causes the cardinality to drop to 0.266  8,376 3,1416 , indicating a signifi cant drop in  uni queness. This isn’t too surprising. After all, lots of books will start with the same fi ve characters.  Table 8-1 shows the results with other key lengths.  TABLE 8-1:  Results with Varying Key Lengths  KEY LENGTH  DISTINCT VALUES  CARDINALITY  1  5  10  15  20  25  30  41  8,376  19,555  25,660  27,582  28,436  29,010  0.001  0.266  0.622  0.817  0.878  0.905  0.923  c08.indd   245 c08.indd   245  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   246  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  From this, the optimal prefi x length looks to be approximately 10 to 15 characters. Values more  than 15 give only a modest increase in uniqueness, whereas for key sizes less than 10, there is a  sharp drop-off in cardinality, causing more rows to match — which means more work for MySQL  in examining those rows and more disk I O as they are read in.  The best index length is clearly highly dependent on the nature of the data, and may even change as  the data itself changes, requiring you to regularly monitor the health of the index.  Covering Indexes  Earlier in this chapter, you learned about the two steps involved when performing a SELECT against  an indexed column in MyISAM. First, MySQL scans the index to obtain the row pointer, and then  it scans the data fi le to the position given in the pointer.  Of course, much of this data will hope- fully already be in memory.  However, if you’ve asked for only columns that exist in the index, this   second step can be avoided, giving a signifi cant boost in performance.  Covering indexes are just a special case of a composite index, in which the index contains all  the columns that you need. Rather than creating a composite index to include columns you’ll be   searching on, you create it with the specifi c aim to eliminate scans of the data fi le — even if this  means including columns that you have no need to search on. So, although covering indexes and  composite indexes are ultimately the same thing, the motivation behind creating them is what   creates the distinction.  Now, return to the real estate example. Most of the time, you want to SELECT the regionId for a  particular combination of region and country, as shown here:  SELECT regionId FROM regions WHERE country="UK" or region="North East"  By creating a composite index on regionId, country, and region, all the data that MySQL needs is  in the index fi le, and there is no need to query the data fi le.  The use of covering indexes can cause a dramatic increase in performance, but, of course, there  are downsides. The most notable is an increase in the size of the index fi le, and larger index fi les  mean more disk I O and less caching in memory. Depending on the columns being indexed, the use  of a covering index could easily double or triple the size of the index fi le. Naturally, large covering  indexes take longer to update, too, which can slow down UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT queries.  Finally, covering indexes are less of an advantage in InnoDB, where primary indexes are stored on  the same page as the data, and the two-step approach of MyISAM is not needed.  When Not to Index  At fi rst glance, it seems as if indexes are a win-win situation. Certainly there are plenty of situations  in which an index on a column will never be used, but is an unused index doing any harm?  The fi rst problem with indexes is that they slow down INSERT and UPDATE queries. Each time the  data in an indexed column is modifi ed, the index must be updated. For the majority of web applica- tions, where tables are read from much more than they are written to, this isn’t a problem. But for  write-heavy tables containing large amounts of data, it can cause a noticeable slowdown.  c08.indd   246 c08.indd   246  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  247  In addition to this, indexes take up disk space, and although the cost of storage is low, larger num- bers of indexes take longer to scan through.  There are also some situations in which indexes aren’t used — for example, in MySQL versions prior  to 5.0, only one index would ever be used per table.  None of these problems are reasons not to use indexing where appropriate, because the benefi ts far  outweigh the drawbacks — but they are enough to make over-indexing something to be avoided.  Index and Table Management  MySQL maintains statistics on various properties of tables and indexes, such as the number of rows  and sizes of indexes. These fi gures are used for  among other things  estimating the optimal query  executing path, but they can become quite distorted after heavy writes.  The ANALYZE TABLE table_name statement can be used to regenerate these statistics, and it makes  sense to regularly run this on tables that are write-heavy. On MyISAM, this causes the whole table to  be locked. With InnoDB, only row-level locking is used, but it’s also less important because InnoDB’s  table stats are never 100 percent accurate anyway — and MySQL knows this.  Closely related to the ANALYZE TABLE statement is OPTIMIZE TABLE table_name, which is used  to defragment tables. Table fragmentation is most common after deleting large numbers of rows.  Although MySQL will attempt to gradually plug these holes with subsequent INSERTs, the gappy  nature of the data in the meantime will result in increased disk reads, thus reducing performance.  Defragmenting the table causes the data to be repacked tightly, eliminating these gaps.  In addition, running OPTIMIZE TABLE on MyISAM tables causes all indexes to be sorted and rebuilt,  which can enhance performance when querying them. Unfortunately, InnoDB indexes can’t yet be  re-sorted because of their structure  something that was discussed earlier in this chapter .  As with ANALYZE TABLE, optimizing causes table-level locking in MyISAM and row-level locking in  InnoDB. But it’s still worthwhile optimizing on a regular basis, especially for tables that are written  to frequently  or after performing batch deletions .  With MyISAM tables, rows are physically ordered chronologically  InnoDB always orders by primary  key , but by using ALTER TABLE, you can ask MySQL to re-order a table by a different column. This  can improve performance in situations in which you will regularly be searching or sorting on that  column. The syntax is simply as follows:  ALTER TABLE table_name ORDER BY column_name  NOTE   Remember that, on large tables, this could take some time.  Query Execution and Optimization  For a query to be executed by MySQL, numerous steps, such as syntax checks and permissions’  checks, must be performed. The two steps that are of particular interest to use are optimization and   c08.indd   247 c08.indd   247  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   248  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  generation of the parse tree. It is at this latter stage that MySQL attempts to determine the most effi - cient method to execute the query before ultimately generating a Query Execution Path  QEP .  MySQL tokenizes the query and builds from these tokens a tree-like structure  the parse tree    detailing all the possible execution paths that may be taken. It is then the job of the optimizer to  determine the most effi cient path to take.  The size of the parse tree increases exponentially as the number of tables in the query increases, and  it could potentially take hours for MySQL to calculate the cost of each potential path. Thus, the  fi rst step of the optimizer is to apply a number of heuristics to eliminate obviously slow paths. These  hard-coded rules are general techniques that MySQL knows can improve performance in the vast  majority of cases  but occasionally it does get things wrong , and includes re-ordering joins, using  covering indexes, and early termination  for example, when a LIMIT clause is used .  Query Cost  At this stage, the parse tree will hopefully have been pruned substantially. For the remaining branches,  MySQL will attempt to determine the cost of each path before settling on the cheapest. Terms like  “best” and “cheapest” can be a little ambiguous. In this situation, MySQL defi nes them by the number  of 4 KB data pages  and by extension, therefore roughly the number of rows  that it estimates must be  read to fulfi ll the query. Thus, a path that causes fewer pages to be read is “cheaper.”  Of course, this logic isn’t always true. It doesn’t take into account that sequential page reads will  generally be a lot faster than random page reads  thus, it would probably be faster to read four  sequential pages than three nonsequential pages , and it assumes that all page reads are from disk.  In practice, some pages will likely be cached in memory.  To estimate the cost of the various paths, MySQL looks at statistics for the tables, such as the num- ber of rows, the length and number of keys, and key distributions. Based on these, a numeric query  cost is calculated for each path. You can see the calculated query cost for a given query by examin- ing the last_query_cost variable immediately after executing a query:  mysql> SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE * FROM regions WHERE region="North East"; .... mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE  'last_query_cost'; +-----------------+----------+  Variable_name    Value     +-----------------+----------+  Last_query_cost  2.799000  +-----------------+----------+  This provides a useful metric to use when creating indexes or rewriting queries. For example,  if you remove the region index from the table and rerun the query, you get a query cost of  5.832594 — twice as expensive as when the index was in place. Despite this, the cost is still   relatively low — for joins across large tables, it’s not uncommon to see costs in the tens or  hundreds of thousands.  mysql> select SQL_NO_CACHE propref, addr FROM property JOIN regions ON      property.regionId=regions.regionId WHERE regions.region="North East"; ...  c08.indd   248 c08.indd   248  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  249  mysql> show status like 'last_query_cost'; +-----------------+--------------+  Variable_name    Value         +-----------------+--------------+  Last_query_cost  25073.649391  +-----------------+--------------+  A second problem with estimating the query cost is that the statistics aren’t always that accurate.  For example, although MyISAM keeps an exact count of the number of rows in a table, InnoDB  has only a rough idea  unless, of course, you perform a COUNT query . Key distributions are rarely   perfectly uniform either. Consider an index of employee surnames — in most English language   countries, there will be a lot more beginning with “S” than “Z.”  Tips for SQL Effi  ciency  Bulk Writes  The remainder of this section focuses on tips for writing better  or, perhaps, more effi cient  SQL.   In some situations, it’s common to perform bulk UPDATE DELETE INSERTs on a periodic basis — for  example, pruning log entries on a nightly basis, or loading in data from a comma-separated value   CSV  fi le. The presence of indexed columns can make this process painfully slow because the  indexes will be updated after every query. And as the indexes grow bigger, they take longer to  update — especially if they are too large to fi t in memory.  Ideally, you’d like to tell MySQL to delay updating the indexes until you fi nish the batch operation.  You can do this by temporarily disabling indexes on the table like so:  ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE KEYS;  After you fi nish writing, indexes can be re-enabled using the following:  ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE KEYS;  The cost to update the indexes following a bulk query should not be signifi cantly higher than fol- lowing a single write query.  The disadvantage to this technique is that unique indexes can’t be disabled because checks must  be performed after each write to ensure the data in the indexed column is unique. Despite this,  temporarily disabling keys can still be useful in reducing the number of indexes updated after  each write.  With InnoDB, an additional trick you can use is to temporarily disable autocommit mode. With  autocommit enabled  the default , each write to a table causes a log entry to be written to disk,  immediately followed by a fl ush — so you don’t even benefi t from I O buffering at the OS level. Use  the following to turn autocommit off:  SET autocommit=0;  After performing the batch write, you then issue the COMMIT statement to fl ush the log entries to disk.  c08.indd   249 c08.indd   249  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   250  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  In a similar vein, if foreign key constraints are used on an InnoDB table, these can temporarily be  disabled while performing batch operations. The syntax is simply as follows:  SET foreign_key_checks=0; *perform batch writes * SET foreign_key_checks=1;  Again, this can speed up batch INSERTs signifi cantly by stopping MySQL from checking foreign  keys after each INSERT.  Usually, INSERT queries have the same priority as other queries in MySQL. When a client issues an  INSERT, MySQL queues it up and returns a response to the client after it has been processed. In the  case of batch INSERTs, priority generally isn’t an issue — you usually aren’t in a particular hurry for  the INSERTs to complete. If anything, you’d probably prefer these queries to have a lower priority, to  minimize disruption to other clients.  You can achieve this by using a modifi ed form of the INSERT syntax including the DELAYED  keyword:  INSERT DELAYED INTO table .....  This causes two things to happen. First, control is immediately returned to the client, allowing it  to execute further queries  presumably more INSERTs . Second, MySQL queues up the INSERTs in  memory with a lower priority and executes them only when the table is not in use by any other cli- ents. In practice, this tends to result in the INSERTs being grouped together and written in clumps,  further improving performance.  In addition, you may also want to tune the bulk_insert_buffer_size variable  the default is 8  MB , which controls the size of this buffer for MyISAM tables. It is allocated per client, so care must  be taken not to exhaust system memory.  The downside to delayed INSERTs is that you cannot be sure when the queries will eventually be  executed. On a busy table, it could take some time. During the time that the queries are in memory  waiting to be executed, they are somewhat volatile, too. If MySQL is restarted or the structure of the  table altered, these queries will be lost. Delayed INSERTs are also a little slower than regular INSERTs,  making the latter preferable if activity on the table is low enough not to warrant delayed INSERTs.  Yet another trick to improve INSERT performance is through the use of multiple-row INSERT state- ments, as shown here:  INSERT INTO table VALUES  "Smith", " Peter"  ,  " Roberts", "Stefanie" ;  Although this is no faster to execute for MySQL, it does reduce the amount of data transmitted.  Normalization  Normalization is a staple of computer science books, especially when dealing with relational data- base systems such as MySQL. The main goal is to eliminate  or at least reduce  data redundancy,  thereby reducing the possibility of inconsistencies.  If data is duplicated in multiple places, care must  be taken to update each copy.   c08.indd   250 c08.indd   250  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  251  Although normalization leads to elegant data structures, you aren’t taking an exam in computer  science, and consideration must be given to performance. In some situations, duplicating data  or merging columns into a single table  the so called Spreadsheet Syndrome  is the right thing to  do, and you shouldn’t be afraid to go against what the textbooks say if it leads to better perfor- mance. The general rule is to normalize as much as possible and then denormalize as performance   dictates — sound advice.  Joins  Badly written joins have the potential to be painfully slow, and when analyzing a slow query log,  you often fi nd that joins are the most common  and expensive  entries.  Unless there is a compelling reason not to, it’s almost always a good idea to index columns used in  joins. The benefi t can be exponential.   In the following example, the two tables both have approximately 26,000 rows, and neither of the  two joined columns have indexes on them. You can use the query cost metric to gauge relative per- formance.  You could instead have looked at the number of rows examined or the execution time,  but the query cost is the most accurate.   mysql> select SQL_NO_CACHE count *  from vacancies,vacancy2industry WHERE      vacancy2industry.VAC_VacancyID=vacancies.VAC_ID; +----------+  count *   +----------+     26207  +----------+ 1 row in set  41.43 sec   A query cost of more than 143 million is a far cry from the value of 2.79 seen for the simple SELECT  earlier in this chapter, and a 41-second execution time is unacceptable for a web application. Let’s  try the query again having added an index on vacancy2industry.VAC_VacancyID:  mysql> show status like 'last_query_cost'; +-----------------+------------------+  Variable_name    Value             +-----------------+------------------+  Last_query_cost  143290315.390895  +-----------------+------------------+  mysql> show status like 'last_query_cost'; +-----------------+----------------+  Variable_name    Value           +-----------------+----------------+  Last_query_cost  1672048.503979  +-----------------+----------------+  c08.indd   251 c08.indd   251  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   252  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  Better, but now add an index on vacancies.VAC_ID, too:  mysql> show status like 'last_query_cost'; +-----------------+--------------+  Variable_name    Value         +-----------------+--------------+  Last_query_cost  32862.859059  +-----------------+--------------+  That’s much better. Although the numbers are still fairly high, this is a huge difference — the  indexed version of the query is 1,000 times faster. It’s not diffi cult to see why optimizing one join  query can do more for performance than optimizing a dozen SELECTs.  It also helps MySQL if the columns joined are of the same type and length. Thus, joining a   varchar 32  with a varchar 16  is better than a varchar 32  with an int. But varchar 32   with varchar 32  is even better. This is one situation in which it makes sense to go against the rule  to keep column lengths as short as possible. Don’t be afraid to experiment with increasing the size of  a frequently joined column to match that of the second column.   NOTE   Incidentally, joins on integers are more effi cient than on text columns.  Unless you need negative values, go for unsigned integers.  Only SELECT What You Need  SELECT * is the lazy way to read data from MySQL, and there are a couple of good reasons to  explicitly list column names instead.  First, there’s the danger than any changes to the number of columns in the table will break  web code — especially if the code is structured to expect columns in a particular order.  Second, in many cases, you don’t need all the columns. Requesting them simply means more data  being transferred between the server and client, more memory used for send buffers, and more   memory used by the web code to hold the results. Carefully selecting which columns are actually  needed also increases the opportunity for covering indexes to be used, which can be a huge boost to  read performance.  DELETE versus TRUNCATE  When you want to delete all the rows from a table, TRUNCATE table_name is generally a  better   much faster  choice than DELETE, but there are a few other subtle differences. For example,  TRUNCATE also causes auto_increment counters to be reset, and, in many ways, TRUNCATE can be  thought of as a shortcut for DROP table CREATE table.  DNS Lookups  Remote connections to a MySQL server typically involve DNS lookups because MySQL attempts  to establish whether the hostname of the client matches any of the access masks in the grants table.   c08.indd   252 c08.indd   252  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   Optimizing SQL  ❘  253  Naturally, the latency that this introduces is largely dependent on the responsiveness of the resolving  DNS server being queries.  You can cut out this step by adding skip-name-resolve to my.cnf, which causes MySQL not to  perform a PTR record lookup on the IP address of the connecting client. But be aware that access  masks in the grants table now need to use IP addresses rather than hostnames.  Actually, this isn’t as big an advantage as it may fi rst seem. MySQL has a built-in cache for DNS  lookups, capable  by default  of holding 128 entries.  If you want to increase it further, you need  to recompile MySQL.  Typical MySQL usage patterns involve a relatively small number of clients   making frequent connections  for example, a pool of web servers . So, the vast majority of the time,  DNS responses will be cached in memory anyway.  SQL_SMALL_RESULT and SQL_BIG_RESULT  These two SELECT options provide hints to MySQL on how to handle the data returned by the  query, and are particularly suited for use with GROUP BY or DISTINCT.  For queries that return a large amount of data, SQL_BIG_RESULT tells MySQL not to bother trying  to hold the result in memory  which it normally would , and instead use a disk-based temporary  table. Conversely SQL_SMALL_RESULT asks MySQL to hold the results in memory, which is a lot  faster than disk-based tables.  In most situations, SQL_SMALL_RESULT isn’t necessary because in-memory temporary tables are  what MySQL will use by default anyway, only falling back on disk-based tables if the result set is  too large. By specifying SQL_BIG_RESULT, you save MySQL the effort of fi tting a large result set in  memory, failing, and using a disk-based table. The savings here are only modest, though.  More worrisome is the incorrect use of these options. If you specify SQL_BIG_RESULT on a query  that actually returns a modest amount of data, you lose the performance boost of having the results  returned directly from memory. Similarly, if SQL_SMALL_RESULT is used on a query that returns lots  of data, you confuse MySQL into attempting to store the results in memory.   Given the modest savings offered by these options, and the potential for them to be used incorrectly,  a lot of care must be taken. Only use SQL_BIG_RESULT when you’re sure the result will be big — and  don’t bother with SQL_SMALL_RESULT.  Prepared Statements  In MySQL and many other database management systems  DBMSs , prepared statements offer a  more effi cient way to execute similar statements repeatedly. Unlike standard queries, in which the  complete statement to execute is sent to the server in one go, prepared statements consist of two steps.   In the fi rst step, a template statement is sent in which placeholders  question marks  are used in  place of one or more values. MySQL parses, compiles, and optimizes the query, but without actually  executing it.  The template can be executed at a later date by passing values for the placeholder variables to the  server. This step may be repeated as many times as necessary.  c08.indd   253 c08.indd   253  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   254  ❘  CHAPTER 8  TUNING MYSQL  From a performance perspective, the main advantage here is that the parsing, compiling, and   optimizing need only be performed once, reducing MySQL’s workload. Prepared statements  are also popular because they reduce the possibilities of SQL injection attacks.  In PHP, both the mysqli and PDO MySQL extensions support prepared statements  the mysql  extension does not . Here’s an example using mysqli:  $statement = $mysqli->prepare "INSERT INTO preferences option, value  VALUES  ?,? " ;  Now bind and execute. The first paramter to bind_param is the    bind type; in this case two strings. $statment->bind_param "ss","favorite color", "orange" ; $statement->execute  ; $statment->bind_param "ss","cats or dogs?", "dogs" ; $statement->execute  ;  Because prepared statements involve an extra round trip to the server, using them to execute a single  query is more costly than the traditional method, and there is little to be gained when you are only  executing a handful of queries. As the number of queries executed increases, the benefi ts of prepared  statements become more apparent.  With write queries, the method outlined earlier in the section, “Bulk Writes,” is often a better  solution.  SUMMARY  MySQL performance tuning covers a vast area. As well as tuning MySQL, there is a huge range of  options available for individual storage engines. It’s worth being clear on which tuning options are  properties of MySQL, and which are properties of engines.  The two main storage engines are MyISAM and InnoDB. MyISAM was the default for many years and  offers fast lookups on indexed columns. In recent years, though, InnoDB has overtaken MyISAM and  is now the default engine in MySQL. InnoDB offers fast lookups on primary keys  but less so on   secondaries because of the way keys are stored in fi le , and handles high levels of concurrency better.  It also supports transactions, something missing in MyISAM.  Indexing is an important aspect of tuning, and careful indexing can offer a huge speed boost to   queries. A good understanding of how MySQL parses and executes queries is needed fi rst, though,  and tools such as EXPLAIN and the MySQL query profi ler are invaluable here.  MySQL also offers its own built-in query cache, which can drastically reduce CPU usage. The query  cache is not without its drawbacks, though, and you must understand both the situations in which  invalidations occur, and the impact of nondeterministic functions  such as RAND  in queries.  So far you’ve seen how to tune MySQL and the two major storage engines  MyISAM and InnoDB   for a single-server setup. As your network grows, and a single MySQL instance is no longer enough,  issues of scaling and load balancing arise. In Chapter 9, you’ll see how MySQL can scale horizon- tally using concepts such as replication, partitioning, and sharding.  c08.indd   254 c08.indd   254  05 11 12   4:50 PM 05 11 12   4:50 PM   9  MySQL in the Network  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Setting up and managing MySQL replication   ➤ Discovering advanced features of replication    ➤ Partitioning data in MySQL   ➤ Setting up sharding   ➤ Discovering alternatives to MySQL   Many websites start with the web server and MySQL sharing a single server. This works for a  while, but  hopefully  there comes a time when a single server just isn’t powerful enough. The  next step  particularly on database-heavy sites  is usually to put MySQL on its own server.  Separating these two distinct functional areas is easy, and often requires little more than  changing the MySQL connection string in the web code. As the site continues to grow, more  CPU and RAM are thrown at the database server.  This “monolithic monster” approach to MySQL actually works surprisingly well and is a long- term solution for many websites. Continuing advances in CPU and RAM capabilities mean  that even if a high-end server is reaching saturation point now, something bigger and better  will soon be available.  Simply throwing CPU and memory at a single machine has diminishing returns, however. You  aren’t increasing the data transfer rates from disk or from memory, or decreasing disk seek  times, and so on. Sure, you can update these parts of the system, too  although the rate of  advance in memory speed and disk speed is not nearly so fast , but you still end up with a  system where the bottlenecks are more pronounced than ever.   c09.indd   255 c09.indd   255  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   256  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  NOTE  It’s also worth remembering that core speeds can be just as important as  the number of cores. A nonthreaded process  that runs on a single CPU core  is  no faster on a 16-core machine than a 1-core machine — although it may need to  wait longer to be executed.  So, although a single MySQL beast can go a long way, eventually there will be the need to move  away to a multiserver setup. This chapter looks at the options available after you outgrow a  monolithic monster.  The fi rst topic examined in this chapter is replication, which is a built-in feature of MySQL that is  commonly used to scale across multiple servers. Replication isn’t without its drawbacks, though,  and you’ll also see how partitioning and sharding can be used to achieve better effects. Sharding  is a particularly important and powerful concept, and is a topic you’ll meet again in Chapter 10,  “Utilizing NoSQL Solutions.”  Finally, in this chapter, you’ll also discover MySQL Proxy, a highly scriptable application that can  be used to load balance and create other advanced topologies. The chapter concludes with a look at  some of the most popular alternatives to MySQL, including the various forks and branches that are  available.   USING REPLICATION  Although creating a pool of web servers is a relatively straightforward procedure  even though  sessions can be a nuisance , multiserver MySQL setups require a little more, though, because of their  read-write nature. How do you ensure that each server is in sync with the others? What happens if  two servers modify data simultaneously?  For a long time, the only practical option was MySQL’s built-in replication. There are other options  now  such as clustering , but replication is still one of the most popular methods, which works  reasonably well. This section discusses the pros and cons of replication, the possible uses  it’s not  just for load balancing , and the myriad of possible topologies.  The Basics  Replication uses a master-slave confi guration. In the most basic setups, a single server acts as the  master, with one or more slaves syncing their content from this master. Both master and slaves  can perform read queries, but because of the one-way nature of the replication, write queries must  be performed only on the master. If a write is performed on a slave, it never propagates to the  master  or to any other slaves . Figure 9-1 illustrates this basic setup.  c09.indd   256 c09.indd   256  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Using Replication  ❘  257  Master  Changes to the master’s data are synced to the slaves  Slaves  FIGURE 9-1  Writes go to master  Reads go to slave  Client  for example, a web server   The most obvious drawback to this topology is that writes are still centralized on a single server.  You’ll see ways to work around this  to some extent  in the upcoming section, “Advanced  Topologies,” but because most Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP  LAMP  applications are read-heavy   80 percent reads and 20 percent writes is an often quoted fi gure — but this ratio can vary hugely  depending on the application , this often isn’t a huge problem — at least not under moderate loads.  NOTE  In MySQL, the binary log is a log of events that result in changes to the  dataset — for example, changes to table structures, adding deleting rows, and so  on. This log can be used to recover corrupt tables, or for the purposes of replica- tion. The relay log is created by replication slaves to hold binary log events that  have been received from the master.  How does the mechanism of replication actually work? You can think of it in terms of the following  three steps:   1.  The master writes events to its binary log  which must fi rst be enabled .   2.  An I O slave thread on the slave copies events from the master’s binary log to the slave’s   relay log.    3.  A SQL slave thread replays events from the relay log.  If the slave also has binary logging enabled, a fourth step involves the slave writing the replayed  events to its own binary log.  Setting Up Replication  Setting up replication won’t be examined in great detail here because the web is already awash with  tutorials on setting up replication. But, briefl y, the process is as follows.  The following three options must be added to the my.cnf fi le on the master:  log-bin =  var log mysql mysql-bin.log binlog-do-db=my_database server-id=1  c09.indd   257 c09.indd   257  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   258  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  The fi rst line specifi es the location of the binary log, whereas the second contains a comma-separated  list of databases to replicate. It’s generally preferable to select individual databases to replicate, rather  than to have MySQL replicate everything because you usually want to keep the access permissions  stored in the MySQL database private. The third line specifi es an arbitrary numeric ID for the server,  which must be unique  that is, not used by any other slaves or masters in the setup .  At the master MySQL’s command-line interface  CLI , you create a user with the replication  privilege. The slave connects as this user to sync from the master’s binary log.  GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON my_database.* TO 'slave_user'@'slave.example.com'       IDENTIFIED BY 'my_password'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  Next, you fl ush and lock the tables in the database, and make a note of the master’s current position  in the binary log.  USE my_database; FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK; SHOW MASTER STATUS; +------------------+-----------+--------------+------------------+  File              Position   Binlog_Do_DB  Binlog_Ignore_DB  +------------------+-----------+--------------+------------------+  mysql-bin.001026  1031       my_database                     +------------------+-----------+--------------+------------------+ 1 row in set  0.08 sec   Locking the tables prevents any write operations that would cause the position in the binary log to  change.  On the slave, you add the following to the my.cnf fi le, adjusting as appropriate:  server-id=2  After restarting the slave, you must copy data across from the master so that both servers are in sync  and ready to start replication. There are two choices here:    ➤ Take a dump of the data from the master  using mysqldump , and then copy it across and   import into the slave.   ➤ Use the LOAD DATA FROM MASTER command at the slave’s CLI.   The latter choice is deprecated, however, and causes long periods of locking on the master  as well  as not supporting InnoDB . So, you should instead use mysqldump  or mysqlhotcopy .  For large tables, it’s generally faster to pipe the output of mysqldump directly to the slave server, as  shown here:  mysqldump my_database mysql -h slave_ip_address -u username -ppassword my_database  After the slave is up-to-date with the master, you can tell it the position and name of the master’s  binary log, at which point it should start replicating, and then start up the slave thread, as shown  here:  c09.indd   258 c09.indd   258  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Using Replication  ❘  259  SLAVE STOP; CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='192.168.1.10', MASTER_USER='slave_user',      MASTER_PASSWORD='my_password', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.001025',      MASTER_LOG_POS=1031; SLAVE START;  Any write operations performed on the master should now replicate across to the slave. You can  repeat this process to create additional slaves, if necessary, but remember to give each slave a unique  server-id.  Understanding Replication Lag  One drawback of replication is that it offers no guarantees that slaves will be up-to-date with the  master. In perfect conditions, a query executed on the master will be replicated to the slaves in a  fraction of a second. But it’s not uncommon to see a lag of a few seconds on even moderately busy  servers. In more extreme situations, slaves can be hours, or even days, behind their master.  Replication lag can occur for a number of reasons. Occasional spikes can be the result of other pro- cesses  such as a backup script  running on the slave, or a particularly heavy burst of write activity   perhaps caused by a cron script  on the master, or even network congestion. These spikes tend to  sort themselves out. But if you notice that slaves are taking a long time to recover from such spikes,  it’s likely an indication that the slave is close to saturation. Don’t ignore this early warning sign.  For more persistent lag, it’s likely that the slave simply isn’t powerful enough. Remember that  the slave replays every write query performed on the master, as well as answering queries for  clients — so it needs to be of similar power to the master. The only way around this is to upgrade  the hardware or use fi ltering to reduce the amount of data replicated.  Assuming that your hardware is powerful enough, your web application still must appreciate and  cater to the fact that lag may occur. For example, if users edit their profi le  causing a write to the  master , it may be a few moments before the changes are visible  that is, available to be read from  a slave . Most of the time, this delay is less than a couple of seconds. But, occasionally, it could be  longer. Better to warn users that changes are not instantaneous, rather than leaving them unsure of  whether the changes were actually saved.  Monitoring and Maintenance  Unfortunately, setting up replication isn’t the end of the story. It requires frequent monitoring to  ensure that everything runs smoothly. MySQL provides a couple of useful commands for this.  Executing SHOW SLAVE STATUS on each slave provides a lot of information on the status of the  replication, as shown here:  mysql> SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G *************************** 1. row ***************************                Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event                   Master_Host: 192.168.1.10                   Master_User: root                   Master_Port: 3306                 Connect_Retry: 60               Master_Log_File: mysql-bin.000012  c09.indd   259 c09.indd   259  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   260  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK            Read_Master_Log_Pos: 438                Relay_Log_File: slave1-relay-bin.000143                 Relay_Log_Pos: 47         Relay_Master_Log_File: mysql-bin.000012              Slave_IO_Running: Yes             Slave_SQL_Running: Yes               Replicate_Do_DB:           Replicate_Ignore_DB:            Replicate_Do_Table:        Replicate_Ignore_Table:       Replicate_Wild_Do_Table:   Replicate_Wild_Ignore_Table:                    Last_Errno: 0                    Last_Error:                  Skip_Counter: 0           Exec_Master_Log_Pos: 438               Relay_Log_Space: 1875               Until_Condition: None                Until_Log_File:                 Until_Log_Pos: 0            Master_SSL_Allowed: No            Master_SSL_CA_File:            Master_SSL_CA_Path:               Master_SSL_Cert:             Master_SSL_Cipher:                Master_SSL_Key:         Seconds_Behind_Master: 0 Master_SSL_Verify_Server_Cert: No                 Last_IO_Errno: 0                 Last_IO_Error:                Last_SQL_Errno: 0                Last_SQL_Error:   Replicate_Ignore_Server_Ids: 0  Slave_IO_State gives details of the status of the slave thread. The most common status,  Waiting for master to send event, indicates that the slave’s relay log is up-to-date with the  master, which is the preferable state to be in. There are more than a dozen other possible states  though, some of which indicate an error.  Particularly useful is Seconds_Behind_Master, which shows by how much replication is lagging.  This might not be zero, even if Slave_IO_State reports Waiting for master to send event  because this indicates only that the relay log is up-to-date. Events from the relay log still must be  replayed. This would be a clear indication that the slave is struggling to cope with the volume of  writes sent by the master.  SQL Errors  Also worth watching are Last_SQL_Errno and Last_SQL_Error. If the slave chokes on any SQL  queries, the most recent error will be stored in these fi elds. These types of errors cause replication to  halt, requiring manual intervention to fi x, so they are a serious problem. But how do they happen?  Surely, if a SQL query has executed fi ne on the master, it will execute okay on the slave, right?  c09.indd   260 c09.indd   260  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Using Replication  ❘  261  The most common reasons for SQL errors are because of writes carried out on the slave, or because  the master and slave run different versions of MySQL. But there are numerous other situations in  which replication can break, including corruption of binary or relay logs, or crashes on the master  or slave. It’s a sad fact that most database administrators will battle with replication errors at least  once in their careers.  When errors do occur, you have a few options. If you’re confi dent that the error can safely be  ignored, you can skip the problem query by stopping the slave thread, instructing MySQL to skip  the query, and then restarting the slave thread. Following is an example:  SLAVE STOP; SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = 1; SLAVE START;  Errors like these have a habit of snowballing, though. So, unless you are sure that the error can  safely be ignored, skipping it may simply lead to more errors in the future as the slave’s data  becomes even more out-of-sync with the master’s data.  Usually, though, the only way to recover from an error  and be satisfi ed that the problem is com- pletely solved  is to resync from the master. This isn’t an attractive prospect, but it’s a better long- term solution than battling with an out-of-sync slave. Resyncing involves copying over a dump from  the master and setting the slave to the correct position of the master’s binary log — much like  setting up replication from scratch. But because of table locking and the possible size of the  database, it can still be a problem on live servers.  You can do a few things to lessen the likelihood of SQL errors — or at least limit the damage  caused. For starters,, you can set the slaves to read-only using the read_only option in my.cnf.  Users with the SUPER privilege can still carry out write operations, and replication can still run  correctly, but standard users will be prevented from writing to tables.  Because many errors are caused by the master crashing  with the most recent binary log events  not yet having been fl ushed to disk , you can use sync_binlog=1 in my.cnf on the master to force  MySQL to fl ush events to disk after a transaction. This isn’t ideal because you lose the performance  benefi t from caching these writes. But, in many cases, the extra degree of safety makes this a must.  Finally, you can also use skip-slave-start  again in my.cnf  on slaves to prevent them from auto- matically starting replication when MySQL is started. This is particularly useful after a crash, when  you may want to manually repair tables fi rst. If replication starts automatically, any table corruption  may not be immediately apparent, and may manifest itself only further down the line — by which  stage the slave is so out-of-sync that you have no option but to resync from the master.  Monitoring Lag  As previously discussed, lag is an unfortunate consequence of replication, and web applications  that connect to a replicating MySQL server pool must sometimes accommodate for at least a small  amount of lag. When replication is lagging by more than a few seconds, or for long periods, this  generally calls for attention, though, because it can be a sign that the slave is close to its maximum  capacity.  c09.indd   261 c09.indd   261  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   262  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  You’ve already seen that the output of SHOW SLAVE STATUS gives you the number of seconds by  which the slave is lagging, but this isn’t entirely accurate, and will be zero if replication isn’t even  running. Instead, the preferred method to monitor lag is to write a simple monitoring script that  writes data to a temporary table on the master, and then checks the slave for this data. If it takes  more than x number of seconds for the data to propagate across, a warning generates. Such a script  could easily be incorporated into a monitoring stats tool like munin or nagios to plot trends in the  lag, and raise varying levels of alarm, depending on the extent of the lag.  You can even use a script like this as the basis for a routine to turn away read requests to a heavily  lagged slave, preventing clients from seeing stale data, and giving the slave a chance to catch up. The  danger here is that this would result in more traffi c to the other slaves, which could, in turn, cause  them to lag and be temporarily removed from the pool. This effect would snowball until there was  just one slave left  presumably the script would be intelligent enough not to remove a lagging slave if  it were the only slave left in the pool , attempting to handle the work of many slaves. In the section,  “Complementing MySQL,” later in this chapter, you learn how to use MySQL Proxy to balance  requests across a pool of MySQL slaves, even taking into account the load on each.  The Single Master, Multiple Slave Model in Practice  So far, this discussion has focused on one replication topology  although it is by far the most com- mon  — a single master replicating to multiple slaves, with each slave holding an identical copy of  the data to the master. How would you go about using this topology in practice?  If your web code uses a database abstraction class for connecting, it should be possible to modify  the class so that all write queries go to the master  just look for strings like 'UPDATE', 'INSERT',  and so on, in the SQL before sending it off for execution , and some or all read queries go through a  slave.  Depending on the nature of the application and your hardware, you may have the luxury of  sending the most important read requests to the master, eliminating the possibility of lag.   There are a few methods of selecting which slave to use, assuming all carry identical data, but the  most common is round-robin DNS. Create a DNS entry such as slave.example.com and have it  resolve to multiple IP addresses. Clients  for example, web servers  can pick a random IP address  from the list returned.   Unfortunately, this kind of load balancing is quite crude and fails to take into account that some  slaves may be more powerful than others, or under more load than the others. In the upcoming  section, “Complementing MySQL,” you learn how MySQL Proxy can be used for more advanced  load balancing.  Types of Replication  MySQL offers two types of replication. Statement-based replication  SBR  has existed since MySQL  version 3 and is usually what people mean when they refer to replication. Row-based replication   RBR  was added in MySQL version 5.1 and deals with some of the shortcomings of SBR. Let’s look  at the differences between them.  SBR revolves around SQL statements. Each write statement executed on the master is stored in the  master’s binary log and eventually re-executed on each slave. This works well in most cases and has   c09.indd   262 c09.indd   262  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Using Replication  ❘  263  the advantage of generating low volumes of data — so, log fi les are small, and network transfer  is low.  Unfortunately, there are some types of queries that don’t replicate well with SBR. For example, the  nondeterministic nature of a query, such as the following, means that the 10 rows deleted on the  slave may not be the same 10 rows deleted on the master:  DELETE FROM test LIMIT 0,10  The outcome of this query cannot be predicted in advance, and will likely return different results  each time it is executed.  Examples of other functions that are unsafe include LOAD_FILE  , SLEEP  , UUID  , and USER  .  To confuse matters a little more, RAND   and NOW   are SBR-safe.  RBR solves these problems; although it introduces problems of its own. With RBR, it is the changes  to the data itself that are recorded and replicated, not the SQL query. This is much safer than SBR  but comes at the cost of increased network traffi c and log sizes.  If deciding between these two alternative methods seems like a tough choice, the good news is that  MySQL also supports a mixed-format replication, in which both modes are used. With mixed log- ging, MySQL switches between the two formats as the situation demands. This pretty much means  that SBR will be used the majority of the time, but MySQL will switch to RBR if it encounters a  query that would be unsafe with SBR.  The replication mode can be set in my.cnf using the binlog-format directive. Accepted values are  STATEMENT, ROW, or MIXED, and the default is STATEMENT. Following is an example:  binlog-format = "STATEMENT"  More on Filtering  You’ve learned that MySQL enables you to replicate on a per-database basis, but there’s more to  it than that. For starters, you have the option of whether to carry out the fi ltering at the master or  at the slave. You can fi lter at the master by using the following.  To fi lter multiple databases, repeat  these statements.   binlog-do-db=mydatabase binlog-ignore-db=anotherdatabase  These rules control whether the event is logged to the master’s binary log, so fi ltering in this  fashion has a direct result on the amount of traffi c fl owing from the master to the slaves.  However, this method of fi ltering is also the most dangerous because it breaks on queries that  don’t use the currently selected database. As an example, what happens if the following queries  are executed on the master?  USE testdb; UPDATE anotherdatabase.anothertable SET x=1;  c09.indd   263 c09.indd   263  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   264  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  Surprisingly, MySQL considers the second query to be acting on the currently selected database —  testdb — and, as a result, may or may not log it, depending on the binlog*db settings. Such unex- pected behavior could easily lead to data becoming out-of-sync on the slave. So, unless you can be sure  that situations like this won’t arise, it’s best not to use fi ltering at the master, despite its benefi ts.  The alternative to fi ltering at the master is, naturally, to fi lter at the slave. Filtering rules at  the slave all take the form replicate*. Earlier in this chapter, you saw how to incorporate  replicate-do-db in the my.cnf fi le of the slave to initially set up replication, and this is comple- mented by  replicate-ignore-db. Because database names may legally contain commas,  neither of these options allows you to give a comma-separated list of databases. Instead, the  confi guration statements must be duplicated, one for each database.  Filtering at the slave also gives you more control over exactly what is replicated. Whereas  fi ltering at the master limits you to listing which databases can and cannot be logged,  fi ltering at the slave lets you specify individual tables to replicate or ignore  for example,  replicate-do-table=mydatabase.mytable and replicate-ignore-table=mydatabase .mytable  and even lets you use wildcards  for example, replicate-wild-do-table= mydatabase.my% and replicate-wild-ignore-table=mydatabase.my% . Filtering at the slave  also gets around the current database quirk that you encountered with binlog*db.  Advanced Topologies  There are a number of problems with the single-master, multiple-slave topology that has been  discussed thus far:   ➤ Because each slave must replay every write query executed on the master, each slave already   has signifi cant overhead.   ➤ Adding extra slaves slightly increases work for the master. If slaves are at different points  in the master’s binary log, this increases the chances that the data will already have been  fl ushed from memory, increasing disk I O on the master.   ➤ Each additional slave increases network traffi c.   ➤ Although this setup helps to scale read requests, it does nothing to improve writes.   ➤ Each slave maintains its own private query cache, resulting in ineffi cient caching — the   same query might be cached across multiple servers.  Future versions of MySQL may well implement the query cache as a plug-in, capable of spanning  multiple nodes to create a single, centralized cache. Until then, you can either accept that query  caching will be ineffi cient, or implement your own global cache using something like memcache.  NOTE  You learn more about memcache in Chapter 10.  Functional Separation  You can solve some of the shortcomings of the previous model by assigning different functions to  each slave.   c09.indd   264 c09.indd   264  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Using Replication  ❘  265  Consider an online dating site. Rather than having a pool of identical  in terms of content  slaves for  the web servers to choose from, you could use one slave for searching profi les, another for sending  and retrieving messages, and another for viewing member profi les.  As shown in Figure 9-2, this layout has a number of benefi ts. It makes better use of the query  cache on each slave and avoids queries potentially being cached across multiple nodes.  It also  provides the capability to disable the query cache on slaves where you know it will be of little  use.  It enables you to be selective over which tables are replicated to each slave, potentially  cutting down on network congestion  actually, as discussed earlier, only master-side fi ltering cuts  down on network traffi c, but, in the upcoming section, “Replication Performance,” you learn  how you can achieve slave-side replication without the additional traffi c  and easing load on  the slaves.  Master  Writes  Reads go to relevant slave  Search  Proﬁles  Messages  FIGURE 9-2  Client  for example, a web server   Unfortunately, the distinction between tables isn’t usually clear-cut. For example, retrieving  and listing a user’s message box probably won’t rely solely on the Messages table. Most likely,  messages are stored with the sender’s numeric membership number, and you’d need to join  against the Profile table to retrieve the sender’s name  and possible age, location, and photo,  too — the latter may involve joining to an additional Photos table . There are a few work- arounds for this:   ➤ Rather than replicating single tables, replicate as many tables as might be used to satisfy the   query. For the message box, this would mean also replicating the tables containing basic  user information  username and the like , primary photo, profi le, and so on.   ➤ Denormalize the data so that joins are not required. For example, add extra columns to the   Messages table to hold the username, age, location, and photo.   ➤ Use federated tables to span multiple servers.  This isn’t recommended because it introduces   further interserver dependencies.    ➤ Perform the parts of the join query at the application level. For example, retrieve the  sender’s numeric ID from the Messages table, and then query the Profiles slave for  the user’s profi le information.  c09.indd   265 c09.indd   265  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   266  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  If the tables lend themselves to fairly clear distinctions in functionality, the fi rst method  replicating  many tables  is the preferred solution. But if you must duplicate a signifi cant number of tables across  each server, the advantages of this method start to diminish.  The denormalization technique might seem to go against everything you’ve learned about database  design, but it can be a practical solution. It can increase the number of writes, however, because  some data must be updated in multiple places — and writes are usually the main problem because  they are more diffi cult to scale.  Finally, decomposing the join and running each query separately at the application level has the  drawback of being linear in nature, and, hence, slower. You must run one query, wait for the result,  issue another query, wait for the result, and repeat the process.  Figure 9-3 shows an improvement on this model. This time, the Messages server is separate from  the rest of the replication setup, and handles both reads and writes to the Messages table.  Master  Writes on tables other than Messages  Client  for example, a web server   Reads and writes on the Messages table go directly to the Messages server  Search  Proﬁles  Messages  FIGURE 9-3  NOTE  This discussion focuses on the private messaging feature of the fi ctitious  site, but these principles could easily apply to other areas, too  This topology helps to lessen write activity on the master — always a good thing, with this being  the main source of bottlenecks — but it makes things awkward if you must join against other tables  when querying the Messages server. You can denormalize or decompose the join in the web applica- tion, but there’s another option, too.  Figure 9-4 shows a modifi cation to the setup in which the Messages server replicates the Profiles  table from the master, enabling you to perform joins across the Messages and Profiles tables. The  Messages slave is still the authority for the Messages table, and the Messages table doesn’t need to  exist on the master.   c09.indd   266 c09.indd   266  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Using Replication  ❘  267  Master  Writes on tables other than Messages  Proﬁles table  Client  for example, a web server   Proﬁles  Search FIGURE 9-4  Messages  Reads and writes on the Messages table go directly to the Messages server  Pyramid Tree Structure  Master  As the number of slaves directly attached to the master increases,  so does the load on the master — something you want to avoid,  given that resources on the master are precious. One way around  this is to use a pyramid structure, as shown in Figure 9-5. Here,  you connect a small number of slaves to the master, and each of  these slaves, in turn, acts as a master for other slaves.  Server A is both a slave to the main master and a master to serv- ers B, C, and D  refer to Figure 9-5 . Only one branch of the  pyramid is shown, but, in practice, the other primary slaves  could all have secondary slaves attached to them. In theory, a  third level of slaves could also be introduced  B, C, and D each  have a number of slaves attached to them , but it would be a  large application that needed this number of slaves.  A  Confi guring a node as both a master and a slave is actually fairly  straightforward, and uses nothing more than the confi guration  options and methodology provided earlier. The node copies  events from its master’s binary log into its own relay log. These events are then replayed,  and — because binary logging is enabled — are then written to the node’s binary log. This  binary log is, in turn, read by each slave that copies it into its relay log.  FIGURE 9-5  B  C  D  There are two main disadvantages to this model, both coming as a result of the additional chain s   in the replication. First, there is the danger of one of the intermediate servers crashing, breaking the  replication chain. Second, there is a great opportunity for replication lag because events must propa- gate down the tree before they reach the bottom level. The chances of lag increase as the number of  intermediates  or the load on the intermediates  increases.  NOTE  Most likely, you would use only the bottom level of slaves for client  queries  for example, B, C, and D  because the intermediate levels would have  their work cut out acting as both slaves and masters.  c09.indd   267 c09.indd   267  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   268  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  Blackhole and Intermediate Masters  Master  One of MySQL’s more esoteric storage engines is  the Blackhole engine, a sort of glorifi ed  dev  null. Any data written to a table using this engine  is simply discarded silently, whereas any read que- ries against the table return no results.  Intermediate Master  The Blackhole engine is useful in replication  setups because, although SQL statements will be  logged  in the binary log , there is no work associ- ated with executing the query. This makes the Blackhole engine perfectly suited for intermediate  masters  such as in the pyramid topology just discussed  because it greatly cuts down on overhead.  Chances are that with an intermediate master such as this  sometimes also called a distribution  master , you can connect all your slaves directly to it, as shown in Figure 9-6.  FIGURE 9-6  This proves to be a good topology for several reasons:   ➤ The master needs to replicate only to the intermediate master, cutting down load on the master.   ➤ Because the intermediate master uses the Blackhole engine, there is less load on it. Thus, the   hardware demands aren’t so high, and more slaves can connect directly to the intermediate.   ➤ By using slave-side replication fi ltering on the intermediate master, you can cut traffi c   between the intermediate master and the slaves.  This last point is worth reading again and is the solution hinted at over the last few pages. Although  this won’t reduce traffi c between the master and the intermediate master, it means that the binary  log on to the intermediate feels the effect of the slave-side replication fi lters, and, thus, traffi c  between the intermediate and its slaves is reduced.  Setting an intermediate master to use the Blackhole engines is as simple as running ALTER TABLE  on each table, and changing the engine to Blackhole. Remember, though, that any new tables  created on the master do not automatically use the Blackhole engine when they propagate to the  intermediate. You can get around this to some extent by specifying the following in my.cnf:  default-storage-engine = blackhole  This causes the newly created table to use the Blackhole engine, unless the engine is specifi cally  given in the CREATE TABLE command. In this situation, there isn’t much you can do other than  being vigilant.  Master-Master Replication  So far, all the discussed topologies have used a single  master with multiple slaves. Although a slave may  have only one master, there are still numerous pos- sible topologies in which multiple masters exist. In  such setups, each server acts as both a master and  a slave, syncing its contents to the other server s .  Figure 9-7 illustrates a basic setup.  FIGURE 9-7  Master A  Master B  c09.indd   268 c09.indd   268  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Using Replication  ❘  269  Any writes to Master A are replicated across to Master B, whereas any writes on Master B are rep- licated over to Master A. MySQL has the intelligence not to then replicate the query back to the  originating server.  Many administrators are attracted to this model by its apparent advantages. Because write queries  are usually the big bottleneck in master-slave setups, it seems to make sense that you can distrib- ute the load by having two active masters. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Each master still must  execute the same number of write queries, regardless of which node they were sent to. If Master A  receives a write query, it executes it directly, whereas if the query executes on Master B, it replays on  Master A a few moments later anyway.  Master-master replication is also quite error-prone, and can be extremely diffi cult to fi x, should the  two servers become out-of-sync. As an example, consider what happens if both masters execute an  update on the same table simultaneously. This could lead to a situation in which each master holds a  different view of the table, yet no replication errors are generated.  When replication errors do occur in a master-master setup, they make resyncing the two servers  a nightmarish task. In standard master-slave replication, you’d simply discard the slave’s data and  take a fresh copy from the master. But in master-master replication, both servers may have data that  has yet to be replicated to the other. There’s no easy solution to this, other than manually inspecting  the data and attempting to merge changes by hand.  For these reasons, the master-master structure is generally best avoided unless you have special  requirements. But there is a variation on this structure that is rather useful.  Active-Passive Master-Master Replication  The active-passive master-master replication topology is almost identical to the master-master topol- ogy but with one crucial difference. You direct writes only to one of the servers. The other server  takes on a passive role, replaying events from the active master but generating no events.  The advantage of this model  and what distinguishes it from a simple master-slave setup  is that you can  swap which server is the active one whenever you want. For example, if you want to take Master A down  for a hardware upgrade, you simply divert all write traffi c to Master B, and then shut Master A down   having fi rst checked, of course, that it has no events waiting to be replicated to Master B . When Master  A comes back online, it can catch up with Master B. You can then either switch writes back to  Master A or leave them at Master B. The ease with which you can swap the roles of each master makes  this an excellent model for high availability — if one server crashes, you can simply fail over to the other.  Of course, it’s not quite that straightforward. Even if downtime on the currently active master was  scheduled, it would still be inconvenient to change your web code  and probably various cron jobs,  too  to point to the other master.   Using DNS records is one possibility. You could create writes.examples.com and have it resolve to  whichever server is currently the active master. A monitoring script could even automatically update  the DNS record if one server went down. The problem here is that DNS changes can be slow to  propagate. Even if you set a very low Time-to-Live  TTL  on the DNS records, not all intermediate  caches will honor these times  more so if the times are very low .    Rather, a better solution is to use a virtual IP address, which can be swapped between the two serv- ers. Each server will have one IP address that is always bound to it. But a third IP address will also  be present, and will be bound to whichever server is the current master.   c09.indd   269 c09.indd   269  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   270  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  It may seem wasteful to have a second master in a passive role, essentially doing nothing the major- ity of the time other than replicating events from the active master. If you have trouble fi nancially  justifying a passive master, remember that it also offers an excellent way to generate MySQL dumps  without locking the master. The passive master could also double up as a slave, handling some of the  read queries on the setup.   Just make sure your code can cope with situations in which the passive master is down, or takes on  the role of active master.  In which case, it may not handle the additional read queries.  Given these  extra complications, it’s preferable to keep the passive master essentially idle if possible.  Speaking of slaves, how do they fi t into a master-master replication system? Because a slave can have  only one master, this slave subsystem  be it a single slave, group of slaves, or intermediate master   can be connected to only one of the two masters. In the case of a distribution master, you could just  manually re-point it at whichever master was currently the active one.   Apart from requiring manual intervention  which you’d like to avoid , this would also be cumber- some if many slaves were connected directly to the master. Again, the answer is virtual IP addresses.  The same solution that you can use for directing write web traffi c to the active master can also be  used to direct the slaves to the correct master.  Replication Performance  Despite being intended to improve performance, many replication setups introduce their own per- formance issues. Let’s look at some of the most common areas in which bottlenecks occur, and what   if anything  you can do about them.  Network Performance  The amount of network traffi c generated by a replication setup is largely dependent on the number  of slaves, the type of replication  RBR or SBR , and the volume of writes. With SBR, the size and  number of queries is the controlling factor, whereas with RBR it’s the number of rows affected.  Naturally, SBR tends to use more bandwidth than RBR.  It’s generally preferable to connect masters and slaves together over a private, switched network.  This eliminates the possibility of spikes in nonreplication traffi c slowing down replication traffi c  and vice versa.   In cases in which a low number of slaves exists, you can even connect each to the master directly  with an Ethernet crossover cable, further reducing latency by removing the need for a network  switch. As the number of slaves increases, this quickly becomes impractical, though, because each  will require its own network interface card  NIC  on the master.  Bandwidth and latency are rarely an issue when nodes of a replication setup connect over a local  private network, but it’s a different story if they connect over the Internet. Network conditions can  be variable, and there isn’t usually much you can do about it. For situations like these, MySQL pro- vides the slave_compressed_protocol confi guration option for use on the slave. When enabled   default is disabled , this boolean variable causes the data stream to be compressed, generally cut- ting bandwidth usage by at least half. Of course, this compression doesn’t come for free and causes  a small increase in CPU usage on both the master and slave. It’s for that reason that you should not  use compression on local network setups.  c09.indd   270 c09.indd   270  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Using Replication  ❘  271  If you feel adventurous, you could shun MySQL’s compression option and set up a secure shell  SSH   tunnel. Expect similar levels of savings but with the added benefi t of encryption — always a good  thing for data passing through a public network.  Slave Performance  Earlier in this chapter, you learned that slaves generally need to be of similar hardware specifi cations  to the master because they must be powerful enough to replay all the write queries executed on the  master. There’s actually a bit more to it than that.  On a master with multiple CPU cores, several queries could run simultaneously via different threads.  The effect of the binary log is to serialize these into a linear stream of queries, with the result that  when the queries replay back on the slave, they are done so one at a time.  MySQL uses only one  slave replication thread.  It’s not diffi cult to see how a single core on the slave could struggle to keep  up with the master, and this is another example of how core speed can be just as important as the  number of cores.  A slave would likely be better off with 2 × 3 GHz cores than 4 × 2 GHz cores.  There isn’t a great deal you can do about this problem, other than be aware of it. It can help to explain  some replication oddities.  “Why is the slave lagging while CPU usage is only moderate?”  Slave-side  replication fi ltering can also help here by reducing the number of queries that the slave needs to execute.  The Binary Log  Enabling binary logging  as is required for the master  in MySQL adds a little overhead to the sys- tem. But its usefulness in data integrity means that it can often be prudent to enable it on servers  that aren’t acting as masters, too. The reason binary logging doesn’t add much overhead is that  MySQL usually leaves it to the operating system to decide when to fl ush the writes to disk. But this  is also rather dangerous because a server crash can cause any log events still in the buffer to be lost.  MySQL provides the sync_binlog variable that can override this behavior. Setting a value of zero  disables syncing  MySQL leaves it to the operating system , whereas a positive integer value dictates  how regularly the binary log should be synced to disk. A value of 1 means after every transaction, a  value of 2 means after every two transactions, and so on.   Naturally, 1 is the safest setting, but it can also be a performance killer. The reason is not data  throughput but the seek time involved as the disk moves its head to the end of the binary log  each time  assuming other disk I O causes the head to seek to other locations between writes . With  seek times on high-end disks of approximately 3 milliseconds, this limits you to a theoretical maximum  of perhaps 300 transaction writes per second — and that’s before you even add on other disk activity.  There are various possible workarounds for this problem, of which the following four are the most  common:   ➤ Disable sync_binlog or set it to a high value  one that balances performance against   safety . This risks corruption of the binary log, should the server crash.   ➤ Place the binary log on its own hard disk. Providing that nothing else is accessing the   disk, this cuts out the seek time involved in syncing the binary log because the disk head is  already in the correct position at the end of the binary log.   ➤ Many high-end RAID controllers now include a small amount of battery backed-up mem-  ory used for buffering disk writes. Writing to this cache is several orders of magnitude faster   c09.indd   271 c09.indd   271  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   272  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  than writing directly to the disk and has the added benefi t that because the memory has a  battery back-up, if the server crashes, the data won’t be lost.   ➤ Use a solid-state device  SSD  such as fl ash memory. Although seek time is meaningless in  this context, there is still an associated access time — but it’s usually lower than for a con- ventional hard disk.  Of these solutions, battery backed-up memory on the disk is by far the best. But using a second disk  exclusively for the binary log is a cheaper, workable solution.  BATTERY BACKED-UP MEMORY  Hard disks typically have a small amount of onboard memory that is used to buf- fer disk writes. In this way, the disk can return an OK to the operating system almost  immediately, allowing execution to return to the application that performed the write.  Ultimately, the disk’s write buffer  not to be confused with write buffering that may  occur at the operating system level, in system memory  will be fl ushed to the disk. But  if a power failure occurs before this happens, the data will be lost. This is particularly  dangerous because the operating system will be under the impression that the data  was written to the physical disk  because the disk controller returned an OK .  One solution is to disable the disk’s write buffer, but this tends to cause a signifi cant  drop in write performance. Instead, many RAID controllers  and a few disk control- lers  use a lithium-ion battery that can supply power to the write cache for a few  hours or so if a power failure occurs. When power is restored, the write cache will  still be intact and can be fl ushed to disk by the RAID controller as usual.  These battery backed-up units  also referred to as battery backed-up memory,  battery backed-up write caches, and so on  have long been the preferred option for  enterprise-level systems, and their relatively modest cost makes them highly wanted  additions. However, they are generally found only in RAID controllers, and it can  be diffi cult to fi nd a standard SATA disk with battery backed-up write caches.   Their biggest drawback is the reliability of the battery. Batteries have a nasty habit to  gradually discharge over time, and regular checking of the battery is needed — a pro- cess that can be physically tricky because it requires the removal of any casing fi rst.  Some battery backed-up units perform their own battery checking, a process that  can range from simply checking the battery level and topping it up, to performing  a full discharge recharge cycle  because regularly topping up a rechargeable battery  can greatly reduce its capacity . This usually occurs automatically every few months,  and while this is happening, the write cache will be disabled, resulting in a signifi - cant drop in performance.   Many system administrators have been puzzled by this unexpected drop in disk  throughput. The most practical solution is simply to disable auto-learning in the  controller and perform it manually at off-peak times via a cron job  for example,  using the MegaCli tool .  c09.indd   272 c09.indd   272  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Partitioning  ❘  273  Miscellaneous Features of Replication  Before closing the discussion of replication, let’s address a couple of miscellaneous points.  Backups  One common use of replication is to set up a slave to be used for the sole purpose to take backups  from it. Generating backups from MySQL is a common dilemma. It can be slow, pushing the load  up on the server, and causing table or row-level locking, depending on the storage engine used.  With a dedicated backup slave, you can dump data from the databases whenever you like without  worrying about locking or load on the master. Although taking a large snapshot of the data will  likely cause the slave to lag, this is quite harmless  because nothing else is using the slave , and the  slave should soon catch up when the backup fi nishes.  Using Diff erent Engines and Indexes on Slaves  You’ve already seen how an intermediate or distribution master typically uses the Blackhole engine  on tables to cut down on overhead, and there’s nothing to stop you from extending this logic and  using different engines on the slaves. For example, you might use InnoDB for a given table on the  master, but use MyISAM on the slave because you intend to do lots of lookups on secondary indexes.  In this way, you benefi t from faster writing on the master, but faster lookups on the slave.  It’s usually always a case of wanting to use InnoDB on the master but MyISAM  or perhaps one of the  specialist engines  on the slave — rather than the other way around. One of the most common rea- sons is to provide full-text search capabilities — something that InnoDB lacks. This is by no means  the only solution to the full-text issue, though, as you’ll see in the “Full-Text Searching” section  later in this chapter, when you learn about Sphinx.  Similarly, you can also index different columns on the master than the slave  simply by using  ALTER TABLE on the slave . Most likely you’d want to index columns only on the master that are  used in the WHERE clause of UPDATE queries, whereas on the slave you could be more relaxed and  index more liberally. This would speed up write queries on the master  fewer indexes to update ,  whereas still offer appropriate indexing for read queries. Remember, though, that more indexes on  the slave slows down the execution of replayed events from the master — which is already some- thing of a bottleneck.  As you have seen, replication is not a simple subject, and it can result in quite complex topologies.  While it is perhaps the most common way to scale MySQL, it has signifi cant limitations, and  there are numerous other ways to scale out. In the next section, you’ll meet one of these  alternatives — partitioning.  PARTITIONING  In MySQL, partitioning has a precise meaning and shouldn’t be confused with the more general  concept of partitioning seen in strategies such as sharding  which you learn about later in this chap- ter in the section, “Sharding” . Although the latter is sometimes referred to as “partitioning,” you  can be pedantic and stick to the precise meaning.  c09.indd   273 c09.indd   273  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   274  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  MySQL’s implementation of partitioning enables the rows in a table to be transparently split across  multiple disk partitions  horizontal partitioning . Note the word “transparently.” Although the table  defi nition must describe the partitioning that is to be applied, all subsequent queries against the  table run as normal. Partitioning is purely a strategy for the physical storage of data, and clients nei- ther know nor care about the underlying way in which the data is stored.  One of the most common reasons for partitioning is to accommodate large datasets, which would  not otherwise fi t on a single disk. However, there are numerous performance benefi ts, too. Some of  these benefi ts could also be reaped with the use of RAID, and you’ll see a comparison of the pros  and cons of partitioning versus RAID later in this section, as well exactly what partitioning can and  can’t help with.  Creating Partitions  Let’s start by reviewing the basics of creating partitions. The syntax is simply as follows:  PARTITION BY        This can be appended to CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statements, as shown here:  CREATE TABLE test  foo varchar 8   ENGINE=MyISAM PARTITION BY          refers to the partitioning type or the partitioning function used to determine how data  should be split across partitions. Four types of partitioning are currently supported:   ➤ HASH   ➤ KEY   ➤ LIST   ➤ RANGE  Let’s take a closer look at each of these.  HASH  Following is an example of using the HASH type:  PARTITION BY HASH  my_column  PARTITIONS 6.  With this type, MySQL creates a numeric ID by hashing the given column’s value. It then calculates  the modulus  note that the number of partitions to use has been specifi ed  to determine which parti- tion to place the row in. For example, a value of 20 would go in partition 2 because mod 20,6  = 2.  A common use of partitioning is to divide rows by date, and you can easily operate on a DATETIME  column, as shown here:  PARTITION BY HASH   YEAR my_dt_column   PARTITONS 10;  Note that the value given to HASH must be a positive integer  be it an unsigned int column, or an  expression that returns a positive integer .  c09.indd   274 c09.indd   274  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Partitioning  ❘  275  One of the most compelling reasons to use the HASH type is that it ensures even distribution of rows  over the partitions, and  unlike some of the other types  it is fairly simple to set up and maintain.  You simply tell MySQL how many partitions you want, and let MySQL fi gure out how best to parti- tion each row.  NOTE  As of MYSQL version 5.5, linear hashing is also supported. This uses an  alternative hashing algorithm based on powers of 2, which is much faster  an  effect that is more noticeable with large tables . Unfortunately, this algorithm  also causes a much less uniform distribution of rows, and the size of individual  partitions will vary considerably.  Following is an example of using the KEY type:  PARTITION BY KEY  keyname  PARTITIONS 4.  Although similar to HASH, KEY has the advantage that the column passed to KEY does not need to  be a positive integer. MySQL can use its own internal hashing function, guaranteed to generate a  numeric value. This is the primary reason for choosing the KEY type.  KEY  LIST  Following is an example of using the LIST type:  PARTITION BY LIST  my_column        PARTITION p0 VALUES IN  1,2,5,9 ,     PARTITION p1 VALUES IN  3,8,10 ,     PARTITION p3 VALUES IN  4,6,7,11     With the LIST type, you assign particular column values to each partition. In this example, any row  that has a value of 8 for my_column will be placed in partition p1; any row with value 9 will go in  partition p0. Note that, as with HASH, values must be numeric.  Unlike the previous HASH and KEY types  where MySQL decided in which partitions to place data ,  LIST gives you the power to specify exactly where you want certain rows to be stored. This can be  useful for performance, but with this power comes extra responsibility, too. In this example, if you  attempt to write a record with a value of 12 for my_column, MySQL throws an error because you  haven’t specifi ed in which partition to store such values.  RANGE  Following is an example of using the RANGE type:  PARTITION BY RANGE  my_column        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN  1000 ,     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN  2000 ,  c09.indd   275 c09.indd   275  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   276  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK      PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN  3000 ,      PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE    Here, you specify how to split the data based on ranges. If my_column has a value less than 1000,  the row goes in p0. For values between 1000 and 1999,  inclusive  the row goes in p1, and so on.  Again, only non-negative integers are permitted.  The fi nal partition defi nition, p4, uses MAXVALUE. This serves as a catch-all and picks up any values  of 3000 or higher.  Deciding How to Partition  With four main partition types, and with each being similar, the question obviously arises as to  which is best. As you might expect, there is no simple answer to this, and it largely depends on the  type of data — and the ways in which you access the data.  Sometimes the data lends itself well to a particular method — LIST for discrete numeric values or  RANGE for ranges of values. Other times, the choices are already made for you — for strings, KEY is  the only available type.  Partition Pruning  One of the biggest performance advantages in a partitioned table occurs when MySQL uses pruning.  Rather than scan every partition to satisfy a query, MySQL can immediately ignore some partitions  based on its knowledge of the partition structure.  Pruning typically occurs when you use a SELECT with a WHERE clause that references the column on  which the table is partitioned. Following is an example:  PARTITION BY RANGE  my_column        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN  1000 ,     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN  2000 ,     PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN  3000 ,     PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE    SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column < 500  In a query like this, MySQL looks at the partition structure, realizes that only p0 contains matches,  and doesn’t bother to scan the remaining partitions. This performance gain is particularly pronounced  when the table’s index is too large to fi t into memory because it cuts down on costly disk activity.  Of course, this logic works only when you use a SELECT against the partitioned column, so decid- ing which column to partition on often boils down to the question, “Which column will I use most  often in WHERE clauses?” Through a careful choice of a column, you can maximize the potential for  pruning.  Again, EXPLAIN is helpful to confi rm that queries are executed in the way that you intend them to  be. If you query on a column other than the partitioned one, you see that all partitions are scanned,  as shown here:  c09.indd   276 c09.indd   276  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Partitioning  ❘  277   mysql> EXPLAIN PARTITIONS SELECT * FROM test WHERE foo=4585\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: test    partitions: p0,p1,p3,p4 ....  However, if you search on the partitioned column, EXPLAIN refl ects the pruning that can take place.  mysql> EXPLAIN PARTITIONS SELECT * FROM test WHERE my_column=4585\G *************************** 1. row ***************************            id: 1   select_type: SIMPLE         table: test    partitions: p4 ...  Incidentally, when MySQL scans multiple partitions, it still does so linearly. Future versions of  MySQL can hopefully implement some degree of parallel scanning, which is a big boost to perfor- mance when partitions are stored on different physical disks.  Physical Storage of Partitions  Earlier, you learned that one performance advantage of partitioning is the capability to store differ- ent partitions on different disks. However, this is not the default behavior.   With MyISAM tables, each partition will be stored in the data directory using fi lenames of the struc- ture mytablePp0  where p0 is the partition number . For each MyISAM partition, there will be a  .MYD and .MYI fi le.   With InnoDB, the situation is a little more complicated. Only when innodb_file_per_table is  enabled can each partition reside in its own fi le  using the same naming convention as MyISAM parti- tions but with the .idb suffi x .  Setting the data directory  and in the case of MyISAM, the index directory  for each partition can be  achieved like so:  PARTITION BY RANGE  my_column        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN  1000 ,        DATA DIRECTORY=" disk1 data ",        INDEX DIRECTORY=" disk2 index ",     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN  2000 ,        DATA DIRECTORY=" disk3 data ",        INDEX DIRECTORY=" disk4 index ",     PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN  3000 ,        DATA DIRECTORY=" disk5 data ",        INDEX DIRECTORY=" disk6 index ",     PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE        DATA DIRECTORY=" disk7 data ",        INDEX DIRECTORY=" disk8 index ",    c09.indd   277 c09.indd   277  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   278  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  This snippet sets each fi le on a different physical disk, but there’s no reason why multiple indexes  or data fi les  or a combination of the two  cannot live on the same disk. If increased performance is  the goal  as opposed to splitting because of size , and disks are at a premium, it may make sense to  group infrequently accessed partitions on the same disk, allowing regularly accessed partitions  to reside on their own separate disk. A suitable partitioning expression can help to separate older,  less frequently used data into its own partition s .  Partition Management  This discussion could easily spend many pages examining the processes of removing, merging, and  adding partitions, changing partitioning types and expressions, and so on. But such information is  readily available online  most notably from MySQL’s online docs , so let’s concentrate on manage- ment directly related to performance.  In Chapter 8, “Tuning MySQL,” you learned how repairing and analyzing tables can help to keep  MySQL’s internal table statistics  which are often used when determining the optimal query  execution plan, or QEP  up-to-date — especially important when the table is write-heavy.  A slightly different syntax is used when operating on partitioned tables:  ALTER TABLE t1 OPTIMIZE PARTITION p0, p1; ALTER TABLE t1 REPAIR PARTITION p0,p1; ALTER TABLE t1 CHECK PARTITION p0, p1;  In each case, you must specify the partition on which to operate. This can be a single partition, a  comma-separated list, or the keyword ALL  for all partitions .  Partitioning is also incompatible with mysqlcheck and myisamchk, so checking and repairing of  tables must be performed via the MySQL CLI.  Pros and Cons of Partitioning  In general, partitioning is an aid to performance, but the extent can vary greatly. Partitioning is  particularly suited to large data sets where the index would be too large to fi t into memory, and to  data access patterns where pruning can be used. If neither of these conditions is present, the main  benefi t can occur from reduced disk contention by splitting partitions across multiple physical disks.  But because you generally want data to be buffered in memory as much as possible, disk activity will  already hopefully be low.  Partitioning also introduces some slight overhead. For example, when a row is inserted, MySQL  must determine in which partition to store it. Some partitioning types are faster than others   as noted, linear hashing is particularly fast for inserting data  at particular tasks, and the choice of  type should, therefore, refl ect whether the table is mostly read or mostly write, or a combination  of the two.   NOTE  Incidentally, in a master-slave replication setup, it’s perfectly acceptable  to use different partitioning rules on each server. Thus, you might use HASH on  the master  faster inserts  but RANGE on the slaves  faster lookups .  c09.indd   278 c09.indd   278  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Sharding  ❘  279  Another consideration with partitioning is that if the table has a primary  or unique  key, columns  used in the partitioning expression must use this key. For example, the following example is not  permitted:  Instead, you would need to use the following:  CREATE TABLE table1       c1 INT NOT NULL,     c2 DATE NOT NULL,     c3 INT NOT NULL,     c4 INT NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY  c1    PARTITION BY HASH c4  PARTITIONS 4;  CREATE TABLE table1       c1 INT NOT NULL,     c2 DATE NOT NULL,     c3 INT NOT NULL,     c4 INT NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY  c1,c4    PARTITION BY HASH c4  PARTITIONS 4;  In some cases, you might need to artifi cially remove keys or add indexed columns to achieve the  wanted partitioning structure.  Partitioning is certainly a useful weapon in any performance-conscious database administrator’s  arsenal, but it must be used wisely, and big gains can occur only under certain conditions. In the  next section you’ll meet sharding, a far more powerful method of partitioning data, which solves  many of the shortcomings of partitioning.  SHARDING  So far, none of the multiserver MySQL setups examined in this chapter have done much to scale write  performance, so, although the techniques discussed thus far are still useful, they are only useful up to  a certain point. Depending on the size and estimated growth of your platform, replication and scaling  up may be feasible long-term or mid-term solutions. But for large sites, something more is needed.  Sharding is the most common solution to the problem of scaling writes.  Sharding is an example  of data partitioning and is similar in concept to the MySQL partitioning discussed earlier in this  chapter. Just as with partitioning, sharding involves splitting larger tables into smaller parts  called  shards , but that is where the similarities end. Although partitions are transparent to clients,  each shard exists as a separate table and must be referenced as such. Also, the handling of shards is  not automatic as it is with partitions.  Although it requires signifi cantly more work to set up, sharding is a better long-term solution  than any of the methods mentioned previously. However, there’s no point in adding unnecessary   c09.indd   279 c09.indd   279  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   280  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  complexity for the sake of it, so before embarking on sharding, think carefully about whether you  actually do need it.  Let’s look at an example. Consider the posts table of a busy online forum. The table contains col- umns for the post text, the date stamp, the user ID for who made the post, the thread that the post  belongs to, and the forum in which the thread belongs. Because of the write-heavy nature of this  table, contention soon becomes an issue, and you must fi nd a way to scale writes.  Rather than store the posts in a single table, you can split the table into several shards. This process  is as simple as creating extra tables, and then manually copying the existing rows across. As with  partitioning, you must decide on the criteria for splitting, and, in this example, the forum ID seems  like a good candidate. So, you create tables named posts_1, posts_2, posts_3, and so on, and then  copy over any rows where the forum ID is 1 into posts_1, any rows where the forum ID is 2 into  posts_2, and so on.  Next, you tell your application that whenever a user creates a post in forum ID x, you write it to the  table posts_x. Similarly, when you want to view an individual post, a thread, or a list of threads in  a given forum, you use the relevant table for that forum.  As you can see, setting up a system like this could require substantial rewriting of the application.  However, placing different shards on different servers provides a powerful and fl exible way in which  to distribute writes across multiple machines.  Lookup Tables  With the possibility that shards may not  and, in fact, almost certainly won’t  all exist on the same  server, it becomes impractical to hard-code the application to simply look for a table based on a  naming convention  for example, posts_x . Instead, you also need a way to determine the hostname  or IP address of the server on which the shard resides, the login details, and perhaps the name of the  database and table.  The usual way to implement this is through a lookup table, which could be either a MySQL table or  perhaps a memcache object. Table 9-1 shows an example.  FORUM ID  SERVER IP  SERVER USERNAME  SERVER PASSWORD  SERVER DATABASE  TABLE 9-1:  Sample Lookup Table  1  2  3  4  5  6  192.168.0.1  wwwuser  192.168.0.2  wwwuser  192.168.0.3  web  192.168.0.4  192.168.0.4  192.168.0.4  forums  forums  fourms  gDRhux8thu  94Sa89zvVxj  Fa9q9aLK2a  bv62RNJuT  bv62RNJuT  bv62RNJuT  forum_posts  forum_posts  forum_posts  forum_posts  forum_posts  forum_posts  c09.indd   280 c09.indd   280  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Sharding  ❘  281  In many cases, the login details and database names will be standardized, and you can get away  with simply specifying the forum ID and IP hostname on which the shard resides, thus reducing the  size of the table.  The next time the application needs to access a post, it uses the lookup table to determine the  MySQL server to connect to on which the required shard is located.  Fixed Sharding  Lookup tables are an example of dynamic sharding. The application has no hard-coded knowledge  about where and how shards are stored, and must rely on an external map.  You could avoid the need for a lookup table  and, thus, remove some latency and memory require- ments, and perhaps a single point of failure  by explicitly telling the application how to handle  shards — which is fi xed sharding. For example, you could use the modulus of the forum ID to divide  the data into a predefi ned number of shards, or you could use hashing.  This method is a lot less fl exible. You lose the fi ne-grained control that a lookup table offers for size  and location of shards. For those reasons, dynamic sharding is usually the way to go.  Shard Sizes and Distribution  Although it may be tempting at fi rst to aim for one shard per server, this soon becomes impracti- cal. What happens if the shard becomes too big?  That is, the write traffi c for the individual shard  becomes too high for the server to cope with.  Conversely, if you have too many shards, the lookup  table becomes big, requiring more memory and taking longer to search.   The forum posts example works quite well in this respect. You might expect the number of forums  to be in the range of 10 to 100. With 100 shards, you could start by placing them across two serv- ers, each with 50 shards, and then perhaps moving to 25 on each of four servers as the forum grows.  This assumes each shard receives the same amount of activity though, which is unlikely to be the  case. So, you could just as easily assign a couple of heavily accessed shards to one server and a few  dozen infrequently accessed shards to another. With a lookup table, you have a huge amount of  fl exibility.  Sharding Keys and Accessibility  In sharding parlance, the key is the column on which you split the data.  In the forum example, this  was the forum ID column.  Choosing a suitable key is critical for sharding to be a workable solu- tion, and deciding on a key usually starts with an analysis of how the data is typically queried.  In the forum example, the forum ID seems like a sensible choice. The majority of queries fetch lists  of threads in a given forum or fetch posts inside an individual thread  which, in turn, belong to a  given forum . You can easily determine which shard contains the data and query it.  But what if you want to view all the posts made by a given user? Because you’ve sharded by forum  ID, the user’s posts are probably scattered across multiple shards, meaning that you must query each  shard one at a time. Because of the linear nature of this, it can be a performance killer.   c09.indd   281 c09.indd   281  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   282  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  Of course, you could get around this by sharding on the user ID, allowing you to quickly retrieve  all of a user’s posts from a single shard. But this would then make life diffi cult when you want to  retrieve all the posts in a given thread, or all the threads in a given forum.   The best compromise here is to shard by the key that is likely to give the most benefi t  in this exam- ple, you’d anticipate a lot more queries based on the forum ID than on the user ID , and then look  for ways to mitigate some of the performance penalties associated with querying multiple shards.  Most of the performance problems  in PHP applications anyway  arise because of the linear nature  of querying each shard. Although PHP doesn’t actually have the capability to issue multiple data- base queries in parallel, other languages do  such as C and Java . One solution is a helper application  that can issue the queries in parallel, merge the results, and return them to PHP. In the later section,  “Full-Text Searching,” you learn how Sphinx can be used for this.  Another solution is to implement additional lookup tables. For example, you could map the post ID  to the ID of the user who created it and the forum ID that it belongs to. Although such a table could  grow big  making it a burden to cache in memory , it would allow you to easily discover which  shards contained posts by a given user. This would save you having to query every shard, but you’d  still need to query each matching shard one at a time. For a prolifi c user, you may still need to query  a lot of shards.  Rather than face the dilemma of which key to shard on, you could opt to keep two copies of the  data, with each copy sharded by a different key. This would allow you to easily perform lookups  based on the forum ID or user ID. Unfortunately, it would also double the number of queries associ- ated with writing to the table, so this isn’t usually a practical option.  Yet another solution is through the use of federated tables  in which a table on a remote MySQL  server is represented as a local table . These tend to offer poor performance though, so they aren’t  recommended.  Aggressive caching is usually the best workaround, falling back on querying multiple shards if the  cache does not contain the results. This is far from perfect, though, and it can often feel as if shard- ing causes more problems than it solves. Despite that, it is still the preferred way to scale writes.  Cross-Shard Joins  One of the most disruptive aspects of sharding is that it severely limits your capability to join across  tables. Using the forum posts example, the post shards contain the user ID of each post’s author. To  display a thread, you probably want to display some basic information alongside each post, such as  the user’s nickname, avatar, join date, and so on. If the posts’ shard sits on a different server than the  user table, you can’t do a join on the two  at least not without using federated tables, which don’t  offer good performance .  Again, there’s no clean solution, but following are a few possibilities:   ➤ Decompose the join, and run the queries separately. That is, fetch the posts from the shard,  and then perform a second query to fetch user information for each post author. This hurts  performance, but not necessarily drastically.  c09.indd   282 c09.indd   282  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Complementing MySQL  ❘  283   ➤ Denormalize the posts’ table. Add additional columns to hold the username, avatar, and so  on. This is attractive but could substantially increase the size of the data, wasting precious  space in memory and increasing disk I O. It depends how much extra data you need to add.   ➤ Store a copy of the user table on each shard node so that you can still join as normal. You   could use replication to ensure that each node has an up-to-date copy of the user table. This  is a good solution if the table is relatively small or infrequently updated.  And compared  to the posts’ table, both would be true.  But this would be impossible if you also decide to  shard the user table.  Application Modiﬁ cations  Sharding can require extensive rewriting of existing applications to make them shard-aware. Using a  database abstraction class can help enormously, though, because it provides the opportunity to fi lter  and rewrite queries before they are passed to MySQL.   For example, instead of rewriting every piece of code that queries the posts’ table, you can modify  the database abstraction class to catch such queries, and rewrite them to use the appropriate shard   or group of shards, if necessary . This is by no means a trivial task, but it’s infi nitely preferable to  auditing every database query in the application.  COMPLEMENTING MYSQL  So far, the multiserver setups examined here have used only MySQL. But there are a number of com- plementary technologies that can provide useful specialist services such as caching, load  balancing,  and fail-over. By far, the most popular is MySQL Proxy, and this is what this section focuses on,  before briefl y reviewing some popular third-party stats tuning scripts.  MySQL Proxy  MySQL Proxy is an incredibly useful piece of middleware that sits between MySQL servers and  clients. Although this introduces a little extra latency into requests  and a single point of failure ,  it provides the capability to intercept requests  and responses  and to modify or redirect them. The  possibilities are endless because of MySQL Proxy’s powerful built-in scripting language.   Figure 9-8 shows a basic topology with MySQL Proxy sitting in the middle.  MySQL Proxy  Step 1  Step 2  Step 4  Step 3  Client  FIGURE 9-8  MySQL Server  c09.indd   283 c09.indd   283  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   284  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  In step 1, the client connects to the proxy and issues a SQL query. After performing any actions on  the request, the query is then forwarded to the MySQL server  step 2 , which returns its response  to the proxy  step 3 . At this point, MySQL Proxy has the opportunity to perform actions on the  response before returning it to the client  step 4 . The whole process is transparent to the client,  which thinks it is connecting to and querying the MySQL server directly.  Common uses for a MySQL Proxy include the load balancing of queries among multiple slaves, log- ging and generating statistics, splitting reads and writes to separate servers  for replication , imple- menting sharding, rewriting queries generated by a closed-source application, and fi ltering queries  for security. You can concentrate on the performance-related capabilities.  NOTE  Development of MySQL Proxy is moving rapidly, and it pays to use  the latest release. If you use a Linux UNIX distribution that uses a package  repository system, check to see that it carries the latest version. If not, you can  download it from MySQL Proxy’s Launchpad site  https:  launchpad.net  mysql-proxy +download .  Load Balancing  Let’s look at a simple example  Figure 9-9  that requires no scripting: basic load balancing between  multiple replication slaves. Earlier in this chapter, you learned how load balancing could be achieved  by round-robin DNS  or other means by which the client picks a slave at random , with the client   such as a web server  connecting directly to the slave. However, in this example, the client needs  no knowledge of the pool of slaves. It simply connects to the proxy and lets it do the legwork. The  proxy picks a random slave from a predefi ned list and sends the query to it.  Master  Replication  MySQL Proxy  Slave  Slave  Slave  Client  FIGURE 9-9  c09.indd   284 c09.indd   284  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Complementing MySQL  ❘  285  Setting up this kind of load balancing is trivial with MySQL Proxy. You simply supply a list of  IP:port combinations at the command line when starting the daemon, as shown here:  mysql-proxy --proxy-backend-addresses=serverA:3306 --proxy-backend-      addresses=serverB:3306 --proxy-backend-addresses=serverC:3306  MySQL Proxy listens on TCP 4040 by default. This can easily be changed  for example, to the  default MySQL port of TCP 3306  using the proxy-address option.  Also you’ll probably want to  launch the proxy in daemon mode using daemon, run it as an unprivileged user with user, and set it  to restart if it crashes with keepalive.   Alternatively, you can put everything in a confi guration fi le and specify the path to it when starting  MySQL Proxy, as shown here:   cat  etc mysql mysql-proxy.conf  [mysql-proxy] proxy-backend-addresses=serverA:3306 proxy-backend-addresses=serverB:3306 proxy-backend-addresses=serverC:3306 keepalive daemon user=nobody   mysql-proxy –defaults-file= etc mysql mysql-proxy.conf  Load balancing with MySQL Proxy has another major advantage over methods in which the cli- ent itself picks a slave at random  be it via DNS, or from a predefi ned list of slaves . It can detect  if a slave is down and remove it from the pool for a short period of time. This detection is still  fairly crude, however, and isn’t proactive. The proxy will discover only that a slave is down when it  attempts to forward a query to it and is unable to connect. But it will at least forward the query to  another slave instead.  Despite these features, MySQL Proxy isn’t the perfect solution here. Aside from the latency intro- duced  the offi cial documentation suggests approximately 400 milliseconds in the proxy, but there  will also be network latency to factor in , you also add a single point of failure  SpoF  to the net- work. If the proxy goes down, all your read queries stop.   Scripting with Lua  MySQL Proxy can be scripted via its Lua support. Lua is a relatively new scripting language, similar  to the likes of Perl or C in syntax, and designed to be easy to learn. Certainly, if you’re familiar with  other scripting languages, you should have no problem picking it up.  A handful of hook points are provided, allowing scripts to execute user-defi ned functions at key  points in the request cycle. For example, you can hook into connect_server to modify MySQL  Proxy’s behavior when a client connects or read_query_result to modify a query’s results.   With a few dozen lines of Lua, you can write a load balancer. Rudy Rucker has done just this   http:  forge.mysql.com tools tool.php?id=259 . Although Rucker’s example script offers  little more than simply starting the proxy with multiple proxy-backend-addresses options, it   c09.indd   285 c09.indd   285  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   286  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  provides an excellent starting point to create a more advanced load balancer. For example, you  could give each back-end server a weight depending on its power, or redirect to different back-end  servers based on which table database is accessed.  A more advanced Lua script could even query multiple shards on different servers and combine the  results, effectively hiding from the client that sharding was taking place. The only limit here is your  imagination  and time .  Splitting Reads and Writes  A newer feature in MySQL Proxy is the capability to split reads and writes, sending them to dif- ferent servers. This has the potential to make replication a lot easier for applications to implement  because you would no longer have to rewrite code to send writes to the master and reads to the  slaves. You simply send the query to a single address  that of MySQL Proxy  and let the proxy fi gure  out where to route the queries.   NOTE  As of this writing, this feature is still in beta and is probably unsuitable  for use on production servers. But, hopefully, it will mature as time goes on to  become a core part of MySQL Proxy.  Alternatives  MySQL Proxy is undoubtedly the leader in its class, but there are alternatives  of which Spock Proxy  looks the most exciting . It’s also worth pausing to think if MySQL Proxy will be necessary in your  topology. Rewriting queries and results tends to be a fairly specialist requirement, and the primary  use for MySQL Proxy is to load balance across multiple replication slaves. As you have seen, though,  balancing across slaves is far from perfect, and often you’ll opt for a topology where each slave has a  distinct role  to better utilize query caching  or a sharded setup.  Aside from a little extra latency, the main drawback to MySQL Proxy is that it is a single point of  failure. If MySQL Proxy goes down, all read queries are affected. Possible ways to mitigate this  include running two MySQL Proxy machines and then either balancing traffi c across them or using  a hot spare that comes online and assumes the primary proxy’s IP address if the primary goes  offl ine.   MySQL Tools  Monitoring  A range of useful tools are available for analyzing and monitoring MySQL. This section introduces  you to some of the most popular ones. These include tools for monitoring which queries are taking  the longest to run, and showing which steps of query execution are taking the longest. The discus- sion also provides tips on tuning the various buffers and caches.  Mtop  http:  mtop.sourceforge.net   is to MySQL what top is to UNIX — an ncurses-based  tool that enables you to see at a glance which queries are taking the most time to run. Mtop also  provides detailed statistics and can explain or kill individual queries  or groups of queries , making   c09.indd   286 c09.indd   286  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Complementing MySQL  ❘  287  it as much of a management tools as it is a monitor. Packaged with Mtop is Mkill, a tool for killing  long-running queries that come from a particular user or host, or match a given regular expression   regex .  Innotop  http:  code.google.com p innotop   is perhaps the best of the top-like MySQL  monitoring applications. As its name suggests, it is geared toward InnoDB and offers a huge array  of monitoring modes, from replication and transactions, to deadlocks and disk I O. Innotop takes the  pain out of inspecting MySQL and InnoDB stats and is an invaluable tool for any database administrator.  MySQL Query Proﬁ ler  New to MySQL 5 is the query profi ler, a built-in tool for showing where MySQL spends its time.  You already learned about EXPLAIN in Chapter 8, and combined together the two give you a power- ful way to debug MySQL performance problems.  The query profi ler is enabled on a per-session basis and logs stats for each query subsequently exe- cuted. You can then view these stats using the new SHOW PROFILES syntax, as shown here:  mysql> SET profiling=1; Query OK, 0 rows affected  0.00 sec   mysql> select count *  from jos_users where username like '%test%'; ....  mysql> SHOW PROFILES; +----------+------------+----------------------------------------------------+  Query_ID  Duration    Query                                               +----------+------------+----------------------------------------------------+         1  0.56869400  select count *  from jos_users where username like                               '%test%'                                      +----------+------------+----------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set  0.00 sec   By default, the query profi ler stores the 15 most recent queries in memory, and you can view the  most recent using SHOW PROFILE — or SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY n for an earlier query  where n is  the Query ID :  mysql> show profile; +--------------------------------+----------+  Status                          Duration  +--------------------------------+----------+  starting                        0.000017   checking query cache for query  0.000046   Opening tables                  0.000009   System lock                     0.000006   Table lock                      0.000019   init                            0.000020   optimizing                      0.000009   statistics                      0.000011   preparing                       0.000009   executing                       0.000005   Sending data                    0.568485   end                             0.000010   c09.indd   287 c09.indd   287  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   288  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK   query end                       0.000003   freeing items                   0.000033   storing result in query cache   0.000006   logging slow query              0.000003   cleaning up                     0.000003  +--------------------------------+----------+  The profi ling step names should all be self-explanatory, and they enable you to see where MySQL  spends its time. You can determine whether there are issues with locking, or perhaps the table  cache is full, and I O bottlenecks are causing delays in opening the table and reading the data. The  Sending data step does not refer to the process to transfer data across the wire from server to client,  but rather to the whole process to run the query and return the data. Hopefully, future versions of  the query profi ler will break this step down to provide more useful information.  You can also see the effect of the query cache in action  assuming it is enabled  by immediately re- executing the query and profi ling it, as shown here:  +--------------------------------+----------+  Status                          Duration  +--------------------------------+----------+  starting                        0.000017   checking query cache for query  0.000007   checking privileges on cached   0.000004   sending cached result to clien  0.000007   logging slow query              0.000003   cleaning up                     0.000004  +--------------------------------+----------+  This time, you see fewer steps as a direct result of a hit on the query cache.  You can get more information from the profi ler by using the syntax  SHOW PROFILE   [for query n], where type is one of ALL, BLOCK IO, CONTEXT SWITCHES,  CPU, IPC, MEMORY  as of version 5.6, not currently implemented , PAGE FAULTS, SOURCE, or SWAP.  Following is a snippet of the profi le of the original query using the ALL type. For brevity, this just  shows one row, and the data has been formatted vertically using the \G switch.  *************************** 11. row ***************************              Status: Sending data            Duration: 0.733316            CPU_user: 0.304019          CPU_system: 0.176011   Context_voluntary: 436 Context_involuntary: 94        Block_ops_in: 47904       Block_ops_out: 32       Messages_sent: 0   Messages_received: 0   Page_faults_major*: 0   Page_faults_minor: 389               Swaps: 0     Source_function: unknown function         Source_file: .. .. sql sql_select         Source_line: 2317  c09.indd   288 c09.indd   288  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Complementing MySQL  ❘  289  You can see some degree of context switching  but nothing too serious , and some disk activity —  mostly reading in from disk  Block_ops_in . Presumably, the data is not in memory.  NOTE  Page faults  referred to as hard faults in Windows  are not as serious as  they sound. Minor faults occur when a page has been loaded in memory but has  not been marked as such in the memory management unit  MMU . The kernel  remedies this by simply marking the page as loaded in the MMU. By contrast,  a major fault occurs when MySQL attempts to access a page that hasn’t yet  been loaded into memory. The kernel remedies this by reading in the page from  disk  and, if memory is low, possibly writing out a page to disk to free up some  space . This makes major faults much more expensive, but they are still a vital  part of memory management.  Performance  The MySQL Performance Tuning Primer Script  http:  day32.com MySQL tuning-primer.sh   parses MySQL’s status counters and generates a report with recommendations for improvement.  Following is an example excerpt of a report:  KEY BUFFER Current MyISAM index space = 1 G Current key_buffer_size = 1000 M Key cache miss rate is 1 : 310206 Key buffer fill ratio = 44.00 % Your key_buffer_size seems to be too high.

If you are unable to optimize your queries you may want to increase your join_buffer_size to accommodate larger joins in one pass.  Although all this information can be readily calculated by a savvy database administrator by look- ing at the output of SHOW STATUS and SHOW VARIABLES, there’s no denying that the Tuning Primer  Script provides a very useful at-a-glance summary of performance. The suggestions it gives form  useful pointers for the less-experienced administrator.

The focus here is mostly on performance, and the  discussion certainly does not represent a well-rounded, comprehensive backup strategy.  File Backups The obvious way to create backups of MySQL databases would be to copy the fi les from the MySQL  data directory  for example,  var lib mysql  — the frm, MYI, and MYD fi les for MySQL, and the  ib* fi les for InnoDB. It should be apparent that doing this on a live server is not reliable because it’s  unlikely that contents of these fi les will be in sync with the data held in memory.  Shutting down MySQL and then taking a copy of the fi les is one option, but, of course, this results  in the database being down for the duration, making it impractical in many situations. Even if  MySQL must be turned off only for a few minutes, it will start back up with empty caches and may  take several hours to “warm up” and reach optimal performance.  For MyISAM tables, a compromise is to leave MySQL running and execute  FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK prior to copying the fi les. This fl ushes the data to disk and prevents  clients from issuing any writes, making it safe to copy the fi les. After the backup has been taken, the  tables can be unlocked with UNLOCK TABLES.  This is certainly preferable to shutting down the server, and the caches will still be warm, but it can  take some time to fl ush the tables — especially if there are any long-running queries  it may even be  necessary to kill these, simply to minimize the length of time for which the tables are locked  — and  tables will be read-only.  This method is unreliable for InnoDB tables, however. Because of InnoDB’s extensive use of back- ground threads, even fl ushing the tables does not guarantee that they are completely in sync.  SQL Backups The alternative to fi le-based backups is to export the data from MySQL in a format that can be  re-imported at a later date. Usually, this means exporting as SQL.   mysqldump  shipped with MySQL  is generally used for this and  by default  dumps the schema for  each table, along with a series of SQL INSERTs to repopulate them. mysqldump is fl exible and power- ful, and is the basis of many MySQL backup scripts. It can back up all databases, individual data- bases, individual tables, and  because it supports WHERE  can be used to back up only selected rows  of a table. To restore, the dump fi le can simply be piped to MySQL.  This has several obvious advantages over backing up raw binary fi les. The dump fi le can be manipu- lated prior to being re-inserted  for example, if you don’t want to to-reimport it all , is engine- independent  and, with a little work, MySQL version-independent , is less prone to corruption, and  can easily be compared  for example, via diff  to previous backups. mysqldump is also InnoDB-safe.  mysqdump isn’t without its problems, though. The processes to dump and restore the data are both  CPU-intensive and can take a signifi cant amount of time.  When restoring, MySQL must re-execute   c09.indd   291 c09.indd   291  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   292  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  every statement contained in the dump fi le.  mysqldump also issues FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK,  making it no better than copying raw fi les. If anything, the locks remain in place longer because  dumping is signifi cantly slower.  Also, remember to spend some time thinking about the practicalities of re-importing. Although it’s  certainly easiest to run mysqldump with the A switch  causing it to dump all databases , a single,  huge dump fi le containing every database is often impractical to work with, and would likely be  too big to open in a text editor. Most of the backup tools built around mysqldump can generate a  list of databases and tables, and then dump each one to a separate fi le, making it easy to selectively  re-import.  CSV Backups Although you might automatically associate mysqldump with SQL dumps, it can also be used to  create dumps in other formats such as XML or comma-separated value  CSV . Although CSV dumps  are no quicker to create, they have a signifi cant advantage over SQL dumps. They can be imported  using LOAD DATA INFILE, which is usually a lot faster.  MySQL even ships with a tool, mysqlimport, which provides a command-line interface to  LOAD DATA INFILE. Starting with MySQL version 5.1, mysqlimport supports the use of multiple  threads  via the use-threads= command-line option , which further improves performance.  To generate CSV dumps, call mysqldump with the tab option. For each table, a schema will also be  generated, which must be imported in the usual way.  Incremental Backups Creating incremental backups is generally thought of as a nonstarter with MySQL, but there are a  couple of techniques that can achieve this.  You can use mysqldump’s WHERE support, for example, to select rows based on a timestamp column.   Although, for a large table, it might make more sense to archive off older data into a separate table,  which could be backed up less often.   A more complicated method involves backing up the server’s binary logs and allowing events to be  replayed back to MySQL  in much the same way as a replication slave takes a copy of the master’s  binary log and replays it . Naturally, it’s impractical to keep every binary log, so this technique is  most commonly used with full backups generated by another method  for example, mysqldump . In  emergencies, you can import the most recent dump and then replay the binary logs from that point.  After taking a copy of the binary logs, you can issue FLUSH LOGS to cause MySQL to start using a  new log fi le. This ensures that the binary logs start and end at points corresponding to when you  make the backups. For InnoDB tables, the transaction log may also be backed up and replayed in a  similar fashion.  Backing Up from a Slave Another popular method to create backups is to set up a replication slave specifi cally for this.   Although, of course, it can double up as a general-purpose slave for read queries.  A slave on its  own isn’t a backup solution, though. If a DROP or DELETE query were executed on the master, it  would propagate instantly to the slave. But a slave does have the advantage that you can usually take   c09.indd   292 c09.indd   292  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Complementing MySQL  ❘  293  it offl ine  or lock the tables  for a longer period of time. After you unlock the tables, the slave simply  catches up with the master in its own time.  This is such a useful method to minimize the downtime associated with backing up that many  people choose to run a slave on the same machine as the master, solely for the purpose to take back- ups from it. However, this method isn’t without its disadvantages. Because the slave must re-execute  every query received from the master, this results in substantially more load on a single-server setup.  If you want to use a slave for backups, it’s best to run it on another host.  LVM Snapshots A fi nal method to create MySQL backups  and other types of backups for that matter  is to use the  copy-on-write feature of some storage systems, of which Logical Volume Management  LVM  is the  most popular under Linux.  LVM acts as a virtualization layer between the physical media and Linux, enabling you to create  partitions that can span multiple physical disks and can be extended or reduced relatively easily.  The Linux implementation of LVM also supports the concept of snapshots, whereby you can create  an almost instantaneous copy of a partition  resulting in no downtime  and then archive it at your  leisure.  The reason why LVM is so quick to create snapshots is that it doesn’t actually make a physical copy  of the data elsewhere on the disk. Rather, it implements copy-on-write. Any subsequent writes  to the partition you are snapshotting are then made in two places — to the original partition and to  a copy-on-write table  which can be thought of as a change log . At any time, LVM can create the  illusion of having made a full backup of the partition by overlaying the copy-on-write table with  the partition as it currently exists.  This cleverness is also the source of LVM’s biggest drawback though  at least from a performance  perspective , because the existence of a snapshot results in writing twice as much data to the disk.  Not only that, but the copy-on-write table will be located on a different part of the disk, caus- ing lots of disk seeking. Of course, this happens only for the duration of the snapshot’s existence,  so your aim should still be to create an archive from the snapshot and then remove it as soon as  possible.  NOTE  Most of the major operating systems  including the FreeBSD, Windows,  OSX, and Solaris  support LVM, but it isn’t the only copy-on-write system  around. ZFS is a popular choice for Solaris, FreeBSD, OS X, and Linux  via  FUSE , whereas BTRFS is another Linux-only option. On Windows, Shadow  Copy  which requires NTFS  provides similar features.  So far, this discussion has concentrated solely on the offi cial MySQL. However, given the permis- sive licensing on MySQL, there’s nothing to stop third parties from writing patches or branching off  their own versions. Many times, the motivation is to provide better performance, and in the next  section, you learn about some of these alternatives.   c09.indd   293 c09.indd   293  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   294  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  ALTERNATIVES TO MYSQL  Although MySQL is popular, well regarded, and a cornerstone of many websites, it isn’t always the  best tool for the job. There’s no shortage of competing technologies ranging from performance- enhancing MySQL patches to caching mechanisms to lightweight key value databases  for situations  in which a full relational database is not needed . This section looks at some of the most popular  alternatives, along with promising new additions.  MySQL Forks and Branches  It’s easy to get caught up in semantics when describing the various MySQL offshoots that exist.  Some are little more than a collection of patches compiled into MySQL, whereas others are heavily  modifi ed versions incorporating new storage engines. Whether individual projects are best described  as forks, branches, patches, or something else is debatable. But the one thing all these have in com- mon is that they are mostly drop-in replacements for the standard MySQL and can be used without  the need to drastically  if at all  rewrite existing applications.  Why would you need these offshoots? MySQL is already famed for its performance, but in large  applications, it’s inevitable that opinions will differ on how best development should proceed.  Performance is only one of many factors for the MySQL developers, and the offshoots exam- ined here are mostly geared toward providing better performance  sometimes at the expense of  functionality .  MariaDB  With some uncertainty over MySQL’s future licensing, the aim of MariaDB  http:  www.mariadb .org  is to provide a fully compatible general public license  GPL  alternative to MySQL. MariaDB  is usually described as a branch and aims to be fully compatible with MySQL — the project is even  overseen by the original author of MySQL, Michael Widenius.  Aside from its GPL nature, MariaDB includes a host of small performance improvements, including  the following:   ➤ Changes to fsync   behavior on the binary log increase the rate at which changes can be   committed  which is often a bottleneck with replication  and lessen the chances of data loss  on crashes.   ➤ It provides a segmented key cache. By splitting the key cache into pieces  the exact number,   if confi gurable , problems of lock contention are reduced.   ➤ It provides progress reports when altering, checking, and repairing tables, and adding   dropping indexes.   ➤ It provides better query optimization, in particular for subqueries.   ➤ It provides improved thread pooling and handling.  Another main feature of MariaDB is the Aria storage engine  but the two are independent of each  other, and Aria could just as easily be used in MySQL , which aims to be a crash-proof alternative  to MyISAM. Over time, the goals of Aria have widened, and it now supports transactions  to some   c09.indd   294 c09.indd   294  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Alternatives to MySQL  ❘  295  degree  and is ACID-compliant. Even though these features are still in progress, the crash-proof  nature of Aria is enough to make it a worthy contender to MyISAM.  Drizzle  Although MariaDB is a branch of MySQL that can act as a drop-in replacement, Drizzle   http:  drizzle.org  is better described as a fork and contains signifi cant recoding. As such,  although Drizzle is largely compatible with MySQL, it makes no guarantees of this and will almost  certainly continue to diverge from MySQL over time.  Drizzle is built around a microkernel architecture, with most of the noncore functionality  including  logging, the query cache, and authentication  supplied by plug-ins. This modular structure results  in a slim server. Drizzle is specifi cally designed for high concurrency and is optimized for multicore  machines with large amounts of memory.  Not so long ago, this was an area in which MySQL had  problems.   Following are the main differences between Drizzle and MySQL:   ➤ Drizzle supports only MyISAM for temporary tables.   ➤ Many data types from MySQL are no longer valid. These include TINYINT, SMALLINT,   MEDIUMINT, BIT, TIME, and YEAR.   ➤ Partitioning is not supported.   ➤ Drizzle provides its own replication plug-in, based around Google Protocol Buffers.  It’s perhaps best to think of Drizzle as a SQL92-compliant SQL server, rather than as a MySQL  fork. This emphasizes that it is mostly in the MySQL-specifi c extensions that Drizzle differs from  MySQL, and helps remind you that MySQL is not the same thing as SQL. Incidentally, if MariaDB’s  parentage seems hard to beat, it’s worth nothing that the likes of Brian Aker, Google, Sun, and Intel  have all been involved with Drizzle development.  OurDelta  OurDelta  http:  ourdelta.org  provides custom builds of MySQL and MariaDB, compiled  with a handful of community-contributed patches. These range from Percona’s XtraDB storage  engine  more on this in a minute  to contributions by Facebook and Google. Some patches are  performance-oriented, whereas others  perhaps the most useful  provide enhanced logging  and diagnostics — for example, millisecond precision in the processlist.  OurDelta also provide repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, and CentOS, making installation a  breeze on such systems.  Percona Server  Percona  http:  www.percona.com software percona-server  describes its server as a drop- in replacement for MySQL, making it much more like MariaDB than Drizzle for compatibility.  But whereas MariaDB has a fairly broad scope, Percona Server concentrates on performance and  enhanced diagnostics.  c09.indd   295 c09.indd   295  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   296  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  For diagnostics and statistics, some of the features of Percona Server include per table index user  counters, detailed mutex statistics, and enhanced QEP profi ling. Performance features include more  fi ne-grained locking, InnoDB buffer pool preloading, better read-ahead support, and special support  for solid-state devices such as fl ash storage.  Percona also develops the XtraDB storage engine  part of Percona Server, but it can also be down- loaded separately and used on MySQL, MariaDB, or Drizzle . This is an InnoDB fork that boasts  excellent performance, particularly on busy, high-end systems. Features include better diagnostics   via SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS , as well as improved CPU and I O scaling.  Which to Pick?  With so many MySQL offshoots, which should you choose? Or is it best to stick with the tried-and- tested MySQL? Because performance is of primary interest here, it’s almost certainly worth explor- ing the alternatives.  If you have an application that sticks closely to the SQL92 standards without using any many  MySQL-specifi c features, Drizzle is probably the most exciting option. It isn’t a drop-in replacement  for MySQL though, so be prepared to spend some time learning the radical changes that it intro- duces, and possibly recoding some of your SQL queries.  If you need 100 percent MySQL compatibility, Percona Server, OurDelta, or MariaDB are all excel- lent options. MariaDB tends to be more focused toward improving MyISAM  via the Aria engine ,  whereas the Percona team focuses on InnoDB  via XtraDB . Of course, because Aria and XtraDB are  not tied in to MariaDB or Percona Server, you’re free to mix and match.  Full-Text Searching  Despite InnoDB  and, in particular, XtraDB  having the performance edge in a lot of cases, many  users stay with MyISAM because it has a feature not present in other engines: full-text searching.  Just to recap, full-text searching is implemented in MySQL via the FULLTEXT index type. It has  numerous performance and accuracy benefi ts over searching with LIKE or REGEXP, such as bool- ean searching, ranking of results, and stemming. These features make it highly attractive for use in  online searches. But because it is only available in MyISAM, there is a big gap for alternatives that can  be used with other engines such as InnoDB.  There are a few options, however. For example, you have already seen how MyISAM can be used on  a replication slave, whereas InnoDB is used on the master  and perhaps other slaves, too . If the  data to be searched is easily separated from other tables, and is reasonably static in nature, there is  also the option to simply leave it as MyISAM — or duplicate the contents of an InnoDB table into a  MyISAM table for the purposes of full-text searching. Too often, though, searches run against  multiple tables, and keeping them  or copies of them  as MyISAM is impractical.  Full-Text Tuning  Even if using MyISAM is not a problem, full-text searching is far from perfect from a performance  perspective. Before delving into alternatives to full-text, let’s look at some of the available tuning  options.  c09.indd   296 c09.indd   296  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Alternatives to MySQL  ❘  297  FULLTEXT indexes can easily grow large — usually they are used on TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, or LONGTEXT  columns. In the interest of accuracy and keeping the index to a reasonable size, MySQL enables  the minimum and maximum word lengths to be defi ned  of these, the minimum is usually the most  important  via the cnf settings, ft_min_word_len and ft_max_word_len. Changing the minimum  word length can have a dramatic impact on index size.  And as you’ve seen, keeping indexes small  pays off.  So, whenever possible, you should increase this from the default of three characters.  MySQL also uses a list of stop words — words to be ignored when creating FULLTEXT indexes. The  default list contains the usual fi ller words, including and, the, this, that, and so on.  For the full  list, check storage myisam ft_static.c in the MySQL source.  Although the purpose of the stop  word list is primarily to improve the relevance of search results, it also helps to keep the index size  down. If you plan to use FULLTEXT indexes on text that contains a lot of jargon, foreign language  words, or unusual words that appear so often as to be irrelevant in search results, a custom list of  stop words can be specifi ed via ft_stopword_file in my.cnf. As with the maximum minimum  word lengths, all FULLTEXT indexes must be rebuilt after any changes are made.  Unfortunately, FULLTEXT indexes are still somewhat slow, even taking into account these tuning  opportunities. One problem is that, like any other index, MySQL must update the index whenever  data in the table is modifi ed. For large datasets this can be slow, and often it’s overkill. Many times,  searches just need reasonably up-to-date data, and being a few minutes stale is perfectly acceptable.  Sphinx  Having established that there is a need for a better alternative to FULLTEXT indexes, let’s look at the  most popular solution to the problem.  Sphinx is a third-party, standalone search engine that works particularly well with MySQL. It’s  blazingly fast and supports its own subset of SQL  named SphinxQL  — so you can query it directly  in much the same way as you would query MySQL. APIs are also available for most of the popular  programming languages.  The following sections provide information that you need to know to start with Sphinx, but  inten- tionally speed through much of the basics to spend more time on some of the more advanced  features.  Indexes Querying is always done directly against Sphinx, which maintains its own indexes. Querying  Sphinx does not involve MySQL and works even if mysqld is not running. MySQL is often used  as a data source, however, and Sphinx can be instructed  often via a cron job  to pull data from a  MySQL table and index it — but it can pull data from other databases  or even from XML  equally  well.  So, Sphinx maintains its own indexes, and you periodically update these by telling Sphinx to pull  data from MySQL. Various types of indexing are possible, but Sphinx goes for a method that  maximizes search speed. The downside is that updating such indexes can be painfully slow, so it is  impractical to update rebuild them for data that is regularly updated  for example, on a social net- working site, where posts are made almost continually .  c09.indd   297 c09.indd   297  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   298  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  Instead, Sphinx supports the use of delta indexes — that is, it starts by indexing all the existing  data into a master index, and then, for the periodic updates, it writes any new data to a much  smaller second index fi le. This is much faster and enables you to update more frequently  say, every  10 minutes . On a less-frequent basis  say once per day , Sphinx can then merge the delta into the  main index, or do a full index rebuild from scratch.  NOTE  Incidentally, Sphinx also supports real-time  RT  indexes that can be  updated on-the-fl y without the need for periodic cron jobs. These have the  advantage that new data is immediately available for searching, but they don’t  offer as good performance as standard indexes. Thus, these are generally not  preferred — in most situations, it’s acceptable that new data does not appear in  searches instantly.  Data Sources How do you tell Sphinx from where to pull the data, and, equally important, how do you distin- guish “new” data when updating the delta index? The answer lies in the data sources defi ned in the  Sphinx confi guration fi le, which tells it the MySQL connection details  hostname, port, username,  and password  and the query to run to retrieve the data. Following is an example:  source comments {     type             = mysql          sql_host         = localhost     sql_user         = sphinxuser     sql_pass         = dfWH49hs8     sql_db           = blog     sql_sock         =  var run mysqld mysqld.sock     sql_port         = 3306                       sql_query        = SELECT comment_body, comment_title, user_id, \     comment_date, post_id FROM comments }  index comments {     source            = comments     path              =  var data sphinx comments }  This defi nes a source named comments and the SQL to execute when retrieving data from this  source. In the second section, Sphinx is instructed to also create an index named comments based on  the comments source.  Running this SQL on a large table could potentially cause problems with locking or spikes in  resource usage. So, Sphinx also supports the use of ranges where data is fetched chunk by chunk, as  shown here:  c09.indd   298 c09.indd   298  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Alternatives to MySQL  ❘  299  sql_range_step      = 1024 sql_ranged_throttle = 3000 sql_query_range     = SELECT MIN id , MAX id  FROM comments sql_query           = SELECT comment_body, comment_title, user_id, post_id, \  comment_date  FROM comments WHERE id>=$start AND id <= $end  Now, when Sphinx builds the index, it fi rst fetches the maximum and minimum values for the id  column. It then fetches comments in chunks of 1,024 with a 3,000-millisecond pause in between.  As previously explained, it’s undesirable  and often impractical  to rebuild the index from scratch  when rows have been added to the database table, and Sphinx supports the use of delta indexes. To  defi ne the delta index, you just set up similar index and source declarations in the config fi le but  use a SQL query that returns only recently added data. In many cases, rows have a date stamp col- umn that you can use, or in other situations you can make a note  in another table  of the value of  an auto-incrementing column. Following is an example:  sql_query           = SELECT comment_body, comment_title, user_id, post_id, \  comment_date  FROM comments WHERE id>=  SELECT cur_id FROM counter   Attributes Although the previous confi guration snippet can be used as the basis for searching comments on  a blog, it lacks the fl exibility of enabling you to search only on specifi c fi elds. To do this, you need  attributes. By adding the following lines to the confi guration  inside the source section , you create  attributes on the user_id, post_id, and comment date:  sql_attr_uint = user_id sql_attr_uint = post_id sql_attr_timestamp = comment_date  Shortly, you’ll learn how these attributes can then be used for sorting, fi ltering, and grouping results.  For the physical storage of attributes, Sphinx offers two choices:    ➤ They can be stored inline with the indexed data  which resides in a .spd fi le . This solves   the disk-seeking problem  because the attributes will be right next to the index data on disk   but greatly increases the size of the fi le  because the attribute values will be duplicated for  each entry .  There are similarities here with the way MyISAM and InnoDB store indexes.    ➤ They can be stored separately in a .spa fi le. However, storing in a separate fi le is something  of a performance killer because the disk needs to seek between the .spa and .spd fi les. For  this reason, Sphinx always holds a copy of .spa fi les in RAM — which may cause problems  for large attributes.  All things considered, external attributes are generally the best, unless RAM is at a premium.  Generating Indexes Creation of index fi les is done via the indexer binary, part of the standard Sphinx distribution. For  example, to index myindex, the syntax is as simple as this:  indexer myindex  c09.indd   299 c09.indd   299  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   300  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  The confi guration fi le may also be specifi ed at the command line using -c, and -all can be used  instead of an index name to tell Sphinx to build every index listed in the config fi le. If you use delta  indexes, you must list the index names manually, rather than relying on -all.  A particularly useful option when rebuilding indexes is --rotate, which replaces the old index only  after the new one has been rebuilt and sends Sphinx a SIGHUP, causing it to start serving from the  new fi le. Without this option, indexer operates on the live version of the fi le, causing it to be inac- cessible for the entire duration of the re-indexing process.  When using delta indexes, there are two choices:    ➤ Merge the delta into the main index on a regular basis because if the delta index grows too   large, it defeats the purpose.   ➤ Simply rebuild the main index from scratch periodically.  The latter method is preferred because sometimes the nature of the data means that it can be tricky to  ensure that all changes are captured when creating the delta. For example, in the blog comments exam- ple, it’s easy to determine newly added comments to index, but what about edits to existing comments?  Rebuilding completely, say, once a day, is a foolproof method to ensure that all changes are indexed.  Still, if you do want to merge indexes, the syntax is as follows:  indexer  --merge main delta --rotate  Starting Sphinx and Searching You’ve now created a confi guration fi le and indexed your data. The next step is to start the Sphinx  search daemon, searchd. This can be as simple as executing searchd, which then forks into the  background. But following are a few useful command-line options:   ➤ --console — This stops Sphinx from forking into the background and causes it to dump its   logs to the console.   ➤ --iostats — This causes disk activity to be logged on a per-query basis.   ➤ --cpustats — CPU usage stats will be logged for each query.  To perform a search, Sphinx offers a choice of two interfaces. As previously mentioned, Sphinx  implements basic SQL and can also speak the MySQL protocol — so you can just connect to it   for example, via the MySQL CLI  as if it were a MySQL server. However, fi rst you must add  a listener to the confi guration fi le, as shown here:  listen = localhost:9306:mysql41  Another method is to access Sphinx via its native API, implementations of which exist for all the  common languages  including PHP, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, and C++ . Without getting too bogged  down in the details of the API  which are well documented on the Sphinx website , a basic PHP  snippet might look as follows:  require   "sphinxapi.php"  ; $cl = new SphinxClient   ;  c09.indd   300 c09.indd   300  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Alternatives to MySQL  ❘  301  $cl->SetMatchMode SPH_MATCH_ANY ; $res = $cl->Query 'linux' ; print_r $res ;  This displays records where any of the fi elds contain the string 'linux'. Of course, this isn’t fl exi- ble. What if you want to just search on a string appearing in the title? Or what if you want to search  on a particular user ID? You’d get results if the number appeared in any of the fi elds. The answer  lies in the attributes previously mentioned. With attributes in place, you can further fi lter results   think of them as similar to an SQL WHERE clause , as shown here:  $cl->SetMatchMode SPH_MATCH_ANY ; $cl->SetFilter 'user_id', array 4  ; $res = $cl->Query 'linux' ; print_r $res ;  This time, you get results only where a fi eld contains 'linux' and the user_id is 4  assuming you  had previously defi ned user_id as an attribute in the Sphinx confi guration fi le .  You can also use attributes for sorting and grouping, as shown here:  $cl->SetMatchMode SPH_MATCH_ANY ; $cl->SetFilter 'user_id', array 4  ; $cl->SetSortMode   SPH_SORT_ATTR_DESC, "comment_date"  ; $res = $cl->Query 'linux' ; print_r $res ;  This produces the same results as before, but this time, sorted by comment date  newest fi rst .  It’s worth pointing out that Sphinx returns only a list of IDs of matching rows. You still must fetch  the row from the MySQL table.  SphinxSE Recent versions of Sphinx now also support a third way to perform searches. SphinxSE is a storage  engine for MySQL that enables the MySQL server to communicate with searchd, issuing queries  and receiving results. This has the potential to further blur the distinction in some people’s minds  between MySQL and Sphinx, so let’s clarify that previous sentence. SphinxSE is not a storage  engine in the traditional sense — no data is actually stored in tables created with this engine type. It  is merely an interface through which to access Sphinx.  Accessing Sphinx in this way has many advantages. For starters, it’s a more familiar method for  many users. You can send queries and retrieve results in a similar way to other MySQL tables. This  removes the need to rewrite queries to use the Sphinx API and makes Sphinx usable in languages  where a port of the API doesn’t exist. It also enables you to perform joins against other tables.  To create a SphinxSE table, you use the usual ENGINE= syntax. In this case, though, you must  include details of the Sphinx back end to connect to and the index name to use, as shown here:  CREATE TABLE t1       id          INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL,     weight      INTEGER NOT NULL,  c09.indd   301 c09.indd   301  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   302  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK      query       VARCHAR 255  NOT NULL,     INDEX query    ENGINE=SPHINX CONNECTION="sphinx:  localhost:9312 comments";  Note the column names. The fi rst three columns in the table must be of the name and type shown.  You can add additional columns for attributes, provided their names match the corresponding  attribute names.  Rewriting the earlier search query to use SphinxSE results in the following:  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE query='linux;mode=any';  Of course, this just searches for 'linux' in any column. To limit the results to the user_id 4, you  add the attribute clause to the query, preceded by a colon, as shown here:  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE query='test it;mode=any:user_id=4';  Parallel Querying and Distributed Indexes One downside of Sphinx  which isn’t immediately obvious  is that it utilizes only a single CPU core.  All things being equal, running Sphinx on an eight-core machine produces no greater performance  than running it on a quad core. However, Sphinx does support distributed indexes, and with a little  magic, you can execute queries across multiple cores, or even multiple servers.  A distributed index is one in which several sources are defi ned. The sources will be queries by  Sphinx in parallel, and the results merged. The offi cial documentation is currently a little vague on  this, so let’s look at a skeleton confi guration:  source src1 {      sql_query =SELECT comment_body, comment_title, user_id, post_id,       comment_date  FROM comments WHERE id MOD 4 = 0 }  source src2 {     sql_query =SELECT comment_body, comment_title, user_id, post_id,      comment_date FROM comments WHERE id MOD 4 = 1 }  source src3 {     sql_query =SELECT comment_body, comment_title, user_id, post_id,      comment_date FROM comments WHERE id MOD 4 = 2 }  source src4 { sql_query =SELECT comment_body, comment_title, user_id, post_id,       comment_date FROM comments WHERE id MOD 4 = 3  c09.indd   302 c09.indd   302  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Alternatives to MySQL  ❘  303  }  index dist {         type = distributed         local = src0         agent = localhost:9312:src1         agent = localhost:9312:src2         agent = localhost:9312:src3 }  As usual, you defi ne source and index blocks. But notice the use of the modulus of the comment  ID in the SQL queries  not dissimilar to the way the modulus is used in MySQL partitioning . This  example goes for four sources, so it uses MOD 4 to ensure that each source gets one-quarter of the  table rows. The index section then sets the fi rst source as local and adds subsequent sources via  the agent option. This example points them at the locally running Sphinx server, but you could just  as easily specify a remote host:port  If you now run a query against the dist index, each of these four sources will be searched in par- allel and the results aggregated. In this example, each source is local, and Sphinx runs each in a  separate thread  on a separate CPU core . The result should be much faster execution of the query,  especially with large indexes.  Newer versions of Sphinx now include support for multiple local distributed indexes, meaning that  you can simplify  slightly  the index confi guration block to the following:  index dist {         type = distributed         local = src0         local = src1         local = src2         local = src3 }  The advantage here is that you save some overhead on networking  because you now no longer use  agent to connect to Sphinx over TCP , but it’s a slim savings.  By default, Sphinx still won’t search the indexes in parallel. But by using the new dist_threads  option, you can control the maximum number of threads  and, therefore, the maximum number of  distributed indexes that will be searched in parallel  for a query, as shown here:  dist_threads = 4  If you use distributed indexes in this way, it generally makes sense to set dist_threads to the num- ber of CPU cores present.  Load Balancing Setting sources as remote provides the opportunity to load balance Sphinx across several servers,  but this isn’t a particularly common setup. Sphinx generally forms only a small part of a site  that  is, the search feature , and because it offers such good performance, there is usually no need to split  load across several servers. Such a setup also causes each node to be a point of failure. If any one of  the servers goes down, the whole search is broken.  c09.indd   303 c09.indd   303  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   304  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  The situations in which searching across multiple machines in parallel offers a signifi cant perfor- mance gain are generally limited to large indexes — halving the execution time of a 1-second query  is a lot more benefi cial than halving the execution time of a 100-millisecond query. It is more com- mon to require some form of redundancy or load balancing, and you can do this simply by setting  up additional Sphinx servers with duplicate content. You can then either put a load-balancing proxy  in front of them  for example, HAProxy  or randomly select a server at the application level.   Performance Tuning  Performance tuning tends not to be a big issue with Sphinx in the way that it can be with, say,  MySQL. This is partly because Sphinx is already geared toward performance. But with Sphinx tend- ing to play a fairly specialized role in sites, it also tends not to be the focus of attention. There are,  however, a number of optimization steps you can take, both in the confi guration and implementa- tion of Sphinx.  Stop Words As with MySQL FULLTEXT indexes, Sphinx supports the use of stop words  that is, commonly used  words that should not be indexed because their frequency makes searching for them pointless .  Unlike MySQL, though, Sphinx does not have a built-in default word list, so unless this option is  specifi cally set, no stop words are used.  Aside from improving the accuracy of results, use of stop words can greatly reduce index sizes,  resulting in less disk I O, less CPU work, and faster results. The format of the stop words fi le is sim- ply plain text with one word per line. You can tell Sphinx the location of the fi le using the following  confi guration option:  stopwords =  usr local share stopwords.txt  Partial Matching Partial word matching is a useful feature. But if you don’t need it, leave it disabled — it increases  index sizes and is also rather CPU-intensive. If you do need it, Sphinx supports two mutually exclu- sive types: prefi x and infi x. Prefi x only matches at the beginning of words, whereas infi x matches at  any position  including the beginning . Of the two, prefi x is less CPU-intensive and doesn’t infl ate  the size of indexes so much.   Sphinx also enables you to confi gure the minimum string length for matches, rather like ft_min_ word_len in MySQL. For the same reasons as with ft_min_word_len in MySQL, it makes sense  to set this as high as possible — almost always 3 or higher. The confi guration options for partial  matching are as follows:  min_infix_len = 3 infix_fields = col1, col2  Or you can use the following:  prefix_fields = col1, col2 min_prefix_len = 3  c09.indd   304 c09.indd   304  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Alternatives to MySQL  ❘  305  In each case, you supply a comma-separated list of database columns on which to enable partial  matching.  On-Disk Dictionaries The ondisk_dict confi guration option controls whether each index’s dictionary fi le  .spi  is  precached in memory or left on disk. The default, 0, is to cache in memory, and this is usually the  optimal setting — it reduces disk I O and greatly improves access times.  Occasionally, though, it can make sense to enable this option. Typical situations are when mem- ory is scarce, or the dictionary fi le is particularly large  for example, because prefi xes infi xes are  enabled . Enabling ondisk_dict results in an additional disk read  and seek  for each keyword in a  query.  Binary Logging Generally, real-time  RT  indexes that can updated on-the-fl y offer poorer performance, and  they are best avoided. But if you do use RT indexes, it’s often advisable to enable binary logging.   Updates to RT indexes are stored in RAM, so a crash would result in lost data.   The binlog_flush directive controls how binary log events are fl ushed to disk and has three pos- sible values:   ➤ 0 — Logs are fl ushed and synced every second.   ➤ 1 — Logs are fl ushed and synced after every transaction.   ➤ 2 —  Default  Logs are fl ushed after every transaction but only synced every second.  As with MySQL, fl ushing binary logs can cause a signifi cant drop in performance. If you must use  RT indexes and need binary logging  sometimes it’s acceptable not to , consider battery backed-up  RAID memory, as mentioned earlier in this chapter during the discussion of the MySQL binary log.  Pre-Opening Index Files The preopen directive controls whether Sphinx opens all index fi les at startup:  preopen = 1  By default, this is zero  disabled , meaning that index fi les are opened only when a search needs  them, resulting in a little extra overhead. Enabling this option removes the overhead, so it’s generally  worth doing. The only exception is when there are large numbers  thousands  of index fi les. In this  situation, Sphinx may run out of fi le descriptors if it opens them all at once.  Controlling the Maximum Number of Matches A query that returns a huge number of results hogs both CPU and RAM, and is usually unwanted.   Most end users care only about the fi rst few pages of results in a search.  max_matches controls the  maximum number of matches returned and can be set to a modest value  the default is 1,000  to  ensure that a single query doesn’t put unnecessary strain on the server.  c09.indd   305 c09.indd   305  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   306  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  Read Buff ers Sphinx makes use of two read buffers during searches — one for the document list and one for the  hit list. read_buffer controls both of these, with higher values hopefully decreasing disk I O and  the expense of RAM. The default is 256 KB.  Multiprocessing Modes Sphinx supports a number of Multi-Process Modules  MPMs   via the workers confi guration  option  that control how it handles concurrent requests. Following are the available methods:   ➤ none — Requests will be handled linearly, one by one.   ➤ fork —  Default  A child is forked for each request.   ➤ prefork — A handful of worker processes are forked at startup.   ➤ threads — A new thread is created for each request.  These options will be familiar to anyone who has confi gured Apache  as discussed in Chapter 7,  “Working with Web Servers” , and the pros and cons are broadly the same. Although forking is the  default in Sphinx, the act of forking a child uses resources  most noticeably CPU time , and choosing  the prefork method is generally the best option, especially when Sphinx will be serving many small  queries  which would cause lots of forking .   The threaded MPM is also an option. It offers slightly better performance, but carries the disadvan- tage that if searchd crashes, all threads will die.  With the other methods, each process is isolated  from the others.   Disk or CPU? Bottlenecks in Sphinx tend to be caused by either disk I O or CPU load, and determining which  can impact the performance tuning measures that are taken. As previously mentioned, searchd can  be started with the --iostats or --cpustats, and these can shed useful light on where Sphinx is  struggling. For example, if searches are slow, despite relatively modest disk and CPU usage, you  may want to consider distributed indexes. If disk I O is high, make sure attributes are stored  externally — they are held in RAM, which cuts down on disk seeks.  Other Full-Text Engines  Although Sphinx is one of the most popular open source engines for full-text-like search capabili- ties, it is far from the only one.  Another popular choice is Lucene  http:  lucene.apache.org  , a Java search engine from  Apache. Lucene is simply a Java library, but there are various full distributions written on top of  it. The most popular is Solr,  http:  lucene.apache.org solr , also written in Java , which is  a fully standalone application that uses Lucene at its core. Although Solr tends not to offer such a  blistering performance as Sphinx, it does have a number of more advanced features, including repli- cation, automatic warming of caches, and partial index updates. Lucene has a plug-in architecture,  making it more extensible than Sphinx.  c09.indd   306 c09.indd   306  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   Alternatives to MySQL  ❘  307  A newer arrival, elasticsearch  http:  www.elasticsearch.org  , is also built on top  of Lucene and has succeeded in wooing many users from Solr. The main attraction of  elasticsearch is its distributed nature, making it easy to scale out. For example, indexes  are automatically sharded across multiple nodes, with management of the shards all taken care  of behind the scenes. Replication can also be added painlessly.  Numerous other search engines exist, but they tend to deviate more from the original goal of a  simple replacement for MySQL’s FULLTEXT indexes.  Other RDBMSs  SQLite  While MySQL is one of the most popular relational database management systems  RDBMSs , it  is by no means the only one. This chapter concludes with a brief look at two of the most relational  database management systems  RDBMSs , popular alternatives, both of which are based on SQL,  and are sometimes more suitable than MySQL.  Through its extensive use in applications on embedded platforms  along with some high-profi le desk- top applications such as Firefox, Google Chrome, and Skype , SQLite is easily the most widely used  SQL engine, far outweighing MySQL. As its name suggests, it is a lightweight SQL implementation    weighing in at a few hundred kilobytes , implemented as a C library that can be linked in to other  applications. SQLite represents a radical departure from the standard client-server architecture seen in  most other RDBMSs. This makes SQLite easy to deploy, but can it compete with the heavier RDBMSs?  SQLite stores everything in fi les, so the major bottleneck tends to be when accessing these  fi les — particularly when writing because the fi le must be locked. As a result, read queries   for example, SELECT  are generally fast, but write queries are handled linearly and can be signifi - cantly slower than when using MySQL.  SQLite is often thought of as a SQL engine best used for local development and unfi t for use on  enterprise web servers. But this is rather unfair. For many websites  where reads generally far out- weigh writes , SQLite is a perfectly acceptable solution with a pleasantly low CPU and memory  footprint. For write-heavy sites, however, SQLite probably isn’t the best tool for the job. In addi- tion, SQLite lacks many of the performance tuning and scaling capabilities offered by the likes of  MySQL.  PostgreSQL  MySQL’s main competitor in the RDBMS world is PostgreSQL  often referred to simply as Postgres .  Like MySQL, it is widely used, has a large support community, and has the stability of a mature,  maintained application. In the past, Postgres also had two major advantages over MySQL. It scaled  better on mutlicore machines, and it had better support for transactions. Both MySQL and InnoDB  have come a long way since those days, however, and these arguments are now redundant.  Still, there are plenty of other arguments in favor of Postgres. It has better support for triggers and  user-defi ned functions, has a more fl exible authentication model  based around plug-ins, allowing  for authentication against LDAP, Kerberos, PAM, and so on , and has support for parallel querying  and multiversioning.  c09.indd   307 c09.indd   307  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   308  ❘  CHAPTER 9  MYSQL IN THE NETWORK  Postgres is highly confi gurable, and it would be impossible to do justice to a discussion of perfor- mance and optimization in less than 100 pages. For that reason, Postgres is not examined in detail  here. However, you are encouraged to learn more about Postgres before automatically choosing  MySQL as a back end.  Ultimately, the choice between MySQL and Postgres is a personal preference, but MySQL certainly  has the edge for performance.  SUMMARY  When your database outgrows a single-server setup, a huge range of options are available for scal- ing. Replication is one of the most popular, and the topologies available are limited only by your  imagination. The overheads of replication  both on the network and each node  can be signifi cant,  and care must be taken when using replication.  Partitioning and sharding are alternative approaches to horizontal scaling. MySQL supports par- titioning natively, but sharding must be managed manually. Sharding is usually the best option for  scaling  with replication, if necessary . However, performing joins becomes problematic, and you’ll  often fi nd that you must restructure your tables  to reduce normalization  or rewrite code to work  with a sharded setup.  The excellent MySQL Proxy is a piece of middleware that you can use to proxy SQL queries and  rewrite them on-the-fl y. Although it introduces a single point of failure, some situations occur in  which MySQL Proxy is invaluable.  A number of forks and branches of MySQL provide additional functionality or enhanced per- formance. Some  such as Percona  focus on improving InnoDB, whereas others include enhanced  MyISAM implementations. If you are a heavy MySQL user, these forks are defi nitely worth  considering.  Full-text searching is a commonly used feature of MySQL but is only available in the MyISAM engine.  For those who prefer InnoDB  or fi nd MySQL’s full-text searching to be rather resource-intensive ,  an alternative is needed. Although there are various full-text search engines available, Sphinx is  probably the most popular, which can be integrated into MySQL relatively easily. With Sphinx, full- text searching does not need to be the big performance bottleneck that it so often is.   The previous two chapters have revolved around MySQL, which has been something of a corner- stone of web development since the late 1990s. In recent years, however, a new way of thinking  has emerged. Rather than big, bulky RDBMSs, many sites  driven by the need to be capable of  being easily scaled  are moving away toward lightweight databases that offer higher performance  at the expense of simpler relationships between data. In Chapter 10, you learn all about the excit- ing new world of NoSQL.  c09.indd   308 c09.indd   308  05 11 12   4:51 PM 05 11 12   4:51 PM   10  Utilizing NoSQL Solutions  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Discovering a wealth of high-performance alternatives to heavy   database servers   ➤ Creating a super-fast distributed key-value store with memcache   ➤ Using MongoDB for fast access to more complex data types   ➤ Scaling MongoDB across dozens of nodes  In recent years, NoSQL has become a buzzword, and there are dozens of popular projects  that fall under this somewhat broad term. Essentially, NoSQL is a covering term for a range  of storage solutions that eschew relational models in favor of a more back-to-basics approach.  They have been hailed by some as the solution to scalability problems in traditional relational  database management systems  RDBMSs .  Although RDBMSs such as MySQL are invaluable in some situations  think of how useful  ACID compliance is for handling online fi nancial transactions , in many cases, they are  overkill. You don’t need the full power of a relational database simply to select, say, a list of  confi guration options from a single table. NoSQL solutions fi ll this gap, offering lightweight  data storage with a range of features. Some are simple in memory key-value stores, whereas  others provide built-in scaling, support for joins, and some degree of ACID compliance.  Unfortunately, NoSQL has been a classic example of the so-called “hype cycle.” Early hype  around NoSQL promised that it would be a silver bullet for data storage that would spell the  end of relational databases. This led to frenzied adoption, even in situations in which it wasn’t  particularly suited. This, in turn, led to a backlash because NoSQL’s weaknesses gradually  became apparent. It is only now that the hype has subsided that NoSQL is starting to be  re-evaluated as a highly useful tool that can live side-by-side with MySQL.   c10.indd   309 c10.indd   309  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   310  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  Because NoSQL is such a broad term, defi ning exactly what it is can be diffi cult, but there are a few  general features:   ➤ Most solutions are nonrelational and do not offer the capability to join tables.   ➤ Most solutions offer loose table schema, unlike MySQL, where column names and types   must be defi ned in advance.   ➤ A simplifi ed architecture leads to lower latency and higher levels of concurrency.   ➤ Solutions are typically easier to scale than with MySQL.  Although it may seem that the lack of join support is a major drawback in migrating from SQL to  NoSQL, it’s worth remembering that many vertical scaling solutions for MySQL  such as sharding  and functional separation  force joins to be forsaken anyway. In these situations, you are losing a  lot of the value of using a relational database  but still have the overhead , and NoSQL can be an  attractive alternative. Reports of MySQL’s death have been greatly exaggerated.   In this chapter, you learn about two of the most popular NoSQL solutions, which occupy opposite  ends of the spectrum. At one end is memcache, a lightweight in-memory store. At the other end is  MongoDB, a more traditional database system with the power to scale well. This chapter concludes  with a round-up of some of the most popular alternatives.  There are three broad classes of NoSQL, each of which has its pros and cons:  NOSQL FLAVORS   ➤ Key-value stores   ➤ Multidimension stores   ➤ Document stores  Let’s take a closer look at each.  Key-Value Stores  Key-value stores tend to be the most basic class of NoSQL and are commonly used in web  infrastructures for content caching. Examples include memcache membase, Voldermort, and Redis.  They offer fast lookups  usually via a hash table , but the data has no schema, which makes them  unsuitable for storing more complex objects or relationships.  Multidimension Stores  Multidimension stores are a step up from the basic key-value stores, offering more complex  data relationships. Data is structured and is stored in rows and columns — not unlike traditional  relational databases. Such systems tend to be more diffi cult to implement than key-value stores  and are not as fast — but they do offer a lot more fl exibility. Examples include Apache Cassandra,  Hbase, Google’s BigTable, and Amazon Dynamo.  c10.indd   310 c10.indd   310  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   memcache  ❘  311  Document Stores  Document databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB offer a semi-structured store, often with  support for nested data. Key values are often used to hold data formatted in XML or JavaScript  Object Notation  JSON   which may, in turn, consist of key-value data . These stores are intended  more as database replacements than caches and do not offer the blazing performance of key-value  stores.  Although performance is still generally good.   NOTE  Before examining some of the most popular NoSQL solutions, a word of  warning is in order. As with sharding, there’s the danger of thinking that because  the likes of Facebook, Twitter, or Digg use NoSQL, you also must use it. The  rationale is that because the big players use a technology, it must be the right  thing to do, and you should also do it. Remember, though, that these sites have  specifi c needs — and high levels of traffi c. If you have more modest sites, stop  and think. Is a full-scale migration away from MySQL to NoSQL necessary, or  would NoSQL work better as a means to complement MySQL? MySQL scaling  can go a surprisingly long way.  Now, let’s begin wading through the wide range of solutions that fall under the NoSQL banner.  Later in this chapter, in the section “MongoDB,” you’ll meet a popular alternative to MySQL that  offers many of the features of a traditional RDBMS, and has been designed from the ground up  with performance and scalability in mind. But let’s start by looking at memcache, a much simpler  in-memory cache that is widely used alongside MySQL as a means of offl oading simple queries.   MEMCACHE  memcache was originally developed in 2003  the same year in which NoSQL frenzy began , and  quickly became an important part of many websites. It was never intended to be a replacement for  MySQL  unlike some NoSQL applications  but complements it nicely and has found widespread use  as a means to reduce load on databases.  memcache is a network-aware cache that stores key-value data in RAM. As such, it isn’t persistent  storage, and if the machine that it runs on crashes, the data is lost. But this generally isn’t a problem  because memcache is mostly used for caching data that is also stored in a more permanent location   for example, in a MySQL database .  The typical way to deploy memcache is as a side cache, sitting alongside MySQL rather than in front  of it. Clients utilize it like so:   1.  The client  for example, some PHP web code  needs to retrieve some data from the database.   2.  The client fi rst connects to the memcache server and attempts to retrieve the data.   3.   If the data is found in the memcache cache, it is returned to the client.  c10.indd   311 c10.indd   311  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   312  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS    4.   If the data is not found in the cache, the client falls back to querying the database. It then  writes the returned data to memcache so that it is available for future queries. Falling back  on the database is an essential step because the transient nature of memcache means that you  can never be sure a given piece of data will be in the cache.  This is signifi cantly different from the way in which many caches transparently cache data.  With memcache, you must explicitly query and populate the cache. Although this means extra  client-side coding, it provides the power to decide what to cache and what not to, as well as the  caching duration.   Compare this with the MySQL query cache, where even queries that you do not want cached   perhaps because they are rarely executed, or will be invalidated almost immediately  are stored   unless you explicitly override with SQL_NO_CACHE , and invalidation prevents you from storing  stale data.  Installing and Running  memcache runs as a daemon  memcached . By default, it listens on ports TCP and UDP 11211, and  over a socket on UNIX. It’s generally advisable to run it as a nonprivileged user, but remember that  any memory limits imposed on this user  check with ulimit under UNIX  also apply to memcache.  On 32-bit systems, a single memcached instance won’t use more than 4 GB of memory.  Starting memcached is as simple as the following:  memcached -u nobody -m 128 -d  This launches it as a daemon  -d  running as the user nobody  -u nobody , and sets the maximum  cache size to 128 MB  -m 128 . This memory won’t be allocated immediately, but you should ensure  that it is still available — swapping to disk destroys performance.   Among the array of command-line options, a few are worthy of more coverage:   ➤ -M — By default, memcache silently removes older items from the cache when it becomes   full. With this option, it returns an error instead.   ➤ -k — This locks down the paged memory at startup, causing it to be reserved.  The normal   behavior is to allocate memory as needed.  This can improve performance a little and  prevents other applications from taking the memory.   ➤ -c — This is the maximum number of simultaneous connections  default 1,024 . This can  be raised for extremely busy memcached instances, but remember that this also raises CPU  and memory usage.   ➤ -b — This is the request backlog size  default 1,024 . If the maximum number of   connections is reached, new connections will be queued. If the queue becomes full,  further connections will be rejected. Although it’s tempting to raise this limit to prevent  connections from being refused, this will increase request latency. A need to increase the  size of the backlog queue is probably a sign that load should be split across multiple  memcached servers.  c10.indd   312 c10.indd   312  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   memcache  ❘  313  Client APIs  Although memcached speaks a text-based protocol and can be directly communicated with over a  socket  be it TCP, UDP, or a UNIX socket , it’s more common to access it via one of the many  APIs available. APIs exist for C C++, PHP, Java, Python, and Ruby. In fact, in many cases, several  alternative API implementations exist for a given language.  Let’s concentrate on the PHP APIs, and perhaps this is a good time to clarify the slightly confusing  naming conventions. memcache is the name of the project, and memcached is the name of the  memcache daemon  following the standard UNIX naming convention .   PHP offers two implementations: memcache and memcached  both available as PECL extensions .  Although this might seem to imply that one is a client and the other a memcache server, this is  not the case — both are client APIs. PECL memcache is the original implementation from 2004,  whereas PECL memcached is a more feature-rich implementation from 2009. You should use PECL  memcached.  Let’s look at an example that doesn’t use memcache:  $r1 = mysql_query "SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz=1" ; list $foo  = mysql_fetch_row $r1 ; print $foo;  To lighten load on the database, you can incorporate memcache like so:  $cache = new Memcached; $cache->addServer '192.168.0.1',11211 ;  if  $foo = $cache->get 'baz1'   {     print "Found in cache: $foo"; } else {     $r1 = mysql_query "SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz=1" ;     list $foo  = mysql_fetch_row $r1 ;     $cache->put "baz1", $foo, MEMCACHE_COMPRESSED, 180 ;  data is compressed           and expires after 180 seconds     print " Pulled from database then written to cache"; }  Running this code twice should cause the data to be pulled from the database the fi rst time, and  then from the cache on subsequent occasions.  NOTE  Although you could use anything for the key name, it makes sense to use  a logical naming structure to prevent accidental duplicates. This  example uses  the column name and value from the MySQL query, and this approach generally  works quite well. For example, a common use might be to cache the selection of  a user’s name, e-mail address, and various preferences from a table based on a  numeric user ID. In that case, you might call the key "userid"  for example,  "userid1”, "userid2", "userid3", and so on .  c10.indd   313 c10.indd   313  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   314  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  With power, though, comes responsibility, and it generally isn’t a good idea to start caching  everything in sight. Some data is so dynamic that it simply isn’t suitable for caching.  Although, in  many cases, you can still see some benefi t from using a short caching time.  However, with large  datasets, the process of serializing and deserializing the data  memcache stores data serialized  can  add signifi cant CPU overhead on the client. Also, remember that the cache is only a fi nite size, and  priority must sometimes be given to smaller, more frequently accessed objects.  The method of querying memcache and then falling back on MySQL also adds latency in situations  in which memcache does not hold the data. If you know that memcache is unlikely to hold the result,  you may be better off querying MySQL straightaway.   You must also give some thought to the type of query being cached and the reason for caching it.  If your MySQL server is ticking along nicely under only modest load, the real benefi t comes from  caching queries that take a long time to execute. Caching a simple SELECT on an indexed column  probably won’t speed things up for the end user.  It’ll most likely be in the MySQL query cache  anyway.  On the other hand, if your MySQL server is under heavy load, and your primary aim is to  reduce the number of queries  even light ones , more aggressive caching would certainly help.  memcache versus MySQL Query Cache  Speaking of the MySQL query cache, is memcache more effective than this? If you’re talking solely  about access times, there isn’t much difference between them. Fetching data from memcache isn’t  usually signifi cantly faster than fetching data that is in the MySQL query cache. But this is missing  the point a little because scalability and effi ciency are often more pressing concerns.  The big problem with the MySQL query cache is invalidation, or rather the lack of control over it.  As previously discussed in Chapter 8, “Tuning MySQL,” writing to a table causes all entries in the  MySQL query cache that reference that table to be invalidated, even if the actual result in the cache  would not have changed. With memcache, you have control over how long data is cached for — if  you want to serve stale data, it won’t stop you. Also, because memcache doesn’t do as much house- keeping as the MySQL query cache  for example, invalidation and checking SQL syntax isn’t actu- ally part of the query cache but is still a step when accessing it , there tends to be less locking and  overhead, resulting in faster access.   Although the MySQL query cache is limited to caching the results of individual MySQL queries,  memcache can be used to cache anything  within reason . In many cases, you can improve  performance even more by executing your SQL queries, processing the data, and then storing this  in memcache.   For example, consider a blog. Typically, there’d be a comments section on each page below the  article. Your code for rendering the comments would probably involve fetching all the comments  associated with the article ID. Most likely, each comment would have an author ID, so you’d do a  JOIN on the users table to fetch the username, user’s website URL, and perhaps avatar. You’d then  read the database results row by row, substituting the variables into an HTML template fragment.  If you cache the data returned from MySQL as a single object, this isn’t a great deal different from  the MySQL query cache — although it’s still an improvement. But you can go one step further.  What if you cache the HTML fragment containing the nicely formatted comments section? The next  time you read the data from the cache, you don’t need to mess around with reading the template into   c10.indd   314 c10.indd   314  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   memcache  ❘  315  a variable, replacing placeholders with values for variables, and concatenating each fragment  into one — you have the formatted HTML already there. As you can see, with careful thought,  memcache can greatly outshine the MySQL query cache.  Finally, the MySQL query cache runs per-MySQL instance. memcache can be accessed globally. The  MySQL query cache is by no means useless, but memcache has the upper hand.  memcache versus MySQL MEMORY Engine  The MySQL query cache may be no match for memcache, but what about MySQL’s MEMORY stor- age engine? Recall from the discussion in Chapter 8 that this provides similar in-memory storage.  A common use for the MEMORY engine is to hold temporary session data  where it doesn’t matter too  much if the data is lost — users are simply forced to log back in . Would using memcache for session  data actually be any better?  As it turns out, the answer is “yes.” The MEMORY engine has a number of limitations — only certain  data types are supported, scaling is tricky, and only table-level locking is supported — which puts a  limit on concurrency. memcache has none of these limitations and is certainly the superior solution  for large-scale requirements.  Deploying memcache  Many administrators rush into using memcache without appreciating that it will invariably lead to  memory being taken away from other processes. As you know, many operating system kernels like  to use free memory as much as possible for buffering and caching disk I O, so even if user-land  applications are not consuming signifi cant memory, you may still be causing degradation of the I O  subsystem.   This effect is at its worst on single-server setups, where Apache, MySQL, and PHP are all competing  for RAM. If memcache is used in such a setup, care must be taken not to squander cache memory,  but only cache objects where there is a clear overall advantage. Otherwise, you could well be weak- ening the performance of  particularly  MySQL.  On multiserver setups and when memory isn’t in such short supply, you can usually fi nd a machine  somewhere on the network that has a few hundred spare megabytes on which to run memcache.  Database servers aren’t usually a good choice  because they are memory-intensive . Web servers and  or PHP servers are often chosen because they tend to run tasks that are more CPU-intensive than  memory-intensive.   Rarely is it necessary to use a dedicated machine for memcache.  Adding an extra memory stick to  an existing server usually does the trick.  But if you do, go for a modest CPU with plenty of RAM,  situated as few hops as possible from the clients. It would be even better to use a pool of memcache  servers.  Multiserver Setups  Because of the temporary nature of data stored in memcache  it would be a mistake to use it for stor- ing anything more critical , the focus in multiserver memcache setups is on distributing load, rather  than providing redundancy. A pool of memcache servers works out rather well, enabling you to set   c10.indd   315 c10.indd   315  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   316  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  up nodes wherever you have a little bit of free memory. But it is fundamentally different from, say,  a MySQL replication setup where nodes talk to each other. With memcache, each instance operates  independently and has no knowledge of its role in a larger pool.  Instead, distribution of queries across the pool is handled automatically by the memcache client.  The client hashes the key, takes the modulus, and uses this to decide which memcache server to  send the request to. It’s a technique similar to the way in which MySQL decides where to place  rows in a partitioned table.  The problem here is that any change to the number of servers causes keys to be mapped to different  servers. For example, if your key hashes to a value of 58 and you have four memcache servers in  the pool, the query will be sent to server 3  58 mod 4 = 2 . If you add a fi fth server, the query ends  up going to server 4  58 mod 5 = 3 . All of a sudden, your queries are sent to servers that don’t have  the answer — or, worse still, have stale data  from an earlier change to the number of servers in the  pool .  The answer to this problem lies in consistent hashing. Although the theory of this lies beyond the  scope of this book, the effect is to greatly minimize the amount of remapping when servers are  added or removed. Because hashing is implemented in the client library, hashing methods can   and do  vary from one API to another. But in PHP, consistent hashing can be enabled by setting  the ini directive memcached.hash_strategy="consistent".   Native consistent hashing is a relatively new feature of the PHP memcache memcached extensions.  Prior to that, libketama was the most commonly used library for consistent hashing, and it still has  some advantages over the default PHP method:    ➤ libketama uses the Message Digest 5  MD5  algorithm for hashing. Although this isn’t   ideal, it’s an improvement on the Cyclic Redundancy Check 32  CRC32  algorithm used by  PHP, and offers better distribution of keys across servers. PHP now supports the Fowler- Noll-Vo 1a  FNV-1a  algorithm also, which, again, is an improvement on CRC32. The ini  directive memcache.hash_function controls which method is used.   ➤ In environments in which memcache is accessed through different APIs, using a standard   hashing library means that each API can map a given key to the same server, enabling them  to read each other’s data.  Incidentally, libketama can also work wonders with MySQL slaves. Rather than picking a slave at  random to handle a query, you can choose a server based on a hash of the query. Because identical  queries always go to the same slave, this increases the chances of a hit from the MySQL query cache  and stops the same query from being held in multiple query caches.  Utilizing a pool of memcache servers is as simple as adding them to the client, as shown here:  $cache = new Memcached; $cache->addServer '192.168.0.1',11211 ; $cache->addServer '192.168.0.2',11211 ; $cache->addServer '192.168.0.3',11211 ;  The hard work of mapping keys to servers is taken care of by the API.  c10.indd   316 c10.indd   316  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   memcache  ❘  317  Assigning a weight to a server is an important part of any load-balancing system, and memcache  supports this concept when adding servers, as shown here:  $cache->addServer '192.168.0.1',11211, true, 1 ; $cache->addServer '192.168.0.1',11211, true, 3 ;  Another option is to control whether persistent connections are used  the default is true , while yet  another is to set the number of buckets.  multigets and Parallelization  memcache is not MySQL, and you shouldn’t use it as such. This may seem obvious, but it’s a point  worth remembering when storing and retrieving data from it. If rendering a page requires the  execution of 10 SQL queries, storing the result of each of these 10 queries separately in memcache is  usually the wrong thing to do. Instead, you should aggregate the results as much as possible, carry  out post-query compiling  such as substituting the data into a template , and then store the results   often HTML fragments  in memcache.   However, sometimes the nature of the site means that you can precompile certain sections, but  others are too dynamic. Condensing everything into a single memcache object isn’t desirable, and  you need to issue multiple requests.  The obvious way to tackle this would be to issue the requests in a linear fashion, one after the other.  Network latencies and TCP overhead soon add up here, though, and memcache offers a better  solution: using multigets and multisets.  As the names imply, these enable you to get and set multiple objects in a single request. Following is  an example:  $results_array = $cache->get array 'key1', 'key2', 'key3'  ;  This has a big effect on latency — but there’s more. Many of the memcache client APIs also  support parallelization. If the requested keys are held on different nodes, the requests will be sent  in parallel, and the results aggregated by the client. In practice, this doesn’t usually have a huge  impact on overall performance. memcache nodes are typically fast enough that sending 10 queries  to a single node is no slower than sending 1 query to 10 nodes, and you should try to keep the  number of keys required low anyway. Parallelization is usually only a signifi cant help when  large numbers of keys are fetched and set.  Cache Maintenance and MySQL UDFs  When you add an object to memcache, there’s a certain amount of guesswork involved in setting the  expiration time. Imagine your site is raising money for charity, and you want to show the amount  raised so far at the top of each page. Clearly, it won’t matter much if this data is a little bit stale;  so after running some SQL to calculate the total so far, you cache the result in memcache with a  10-minute expiration time.   This works fi ne if you receive a regular stream of donations, but what if donations are more  sporadic — say, two or three per day? Recalculating the total money raised every 5 minutes is   c10.indd   317 c10.indd   317  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   318  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  overkill, but caching the total for, say, 8 hours leads to data being too stale. Wouldn’t it be great if  MySQL could say to memcache, “I’ve just added a row to the table listing donations made. Your data  will be stale now, so please discard it.”  Or, better yet, “Your data will be stale now. Here’s the new  total raised.” This way, you have a total that is never stale  even if a little bit of staleness is acceptable,  no staleness is still preferable , but that is never dropped from the cache unless it changes.   The good news is that MySQL can, indeed, do this through the use of User Defi ned Functions   UDFs  and triggers. You set a trigger to run when the table is written to and use a UDF to cause  MySQL to issue a set   directly on the memcache server s .   Do you need this complexity? In the donations example, you could probably just as easily have  modifi ed your web code so that when the database table is written to, the memcache object is also  updated. This isn’t always practical, though. Updates may be coming from multiple sources, some  of them perhaps even external, where you have no control over the code. In some situations, updates  via MySQL UDFs are the most appropriate solution.  NOTE  The latest UDFs are available from https:  launchpad.net  memcached-udfs, and you can fi nd documentation on installing and setting  up the functions on the MySQL website  http:  dev.mysql.com doc  refman 5.6 en ha-memcached-interfaces-mysqludf.html .  Monitoring Performance  Telling how full the memcache servers are, how many objects have been fl ushed because of lack of  space, the hit ratio, and so on, are invaluable pieces of information.  Each memcache server keeps quite detailed stats, which can be accessed in a number of ways. The  simplest is to telnet into the daemon and issue the stats command, as shown here:  $ telnet 0 11211 Trying 0.0.0.0... Connected to 0. Escape character is '^]'. stats STAT pid 9545 STAT uptime 7956383 STAT time 1312417995 STAT version 1.4.5 STAT pointer_size 32 STAT rusage_user 2714.693657 STAT rusage_system 8373.123287 STAT curr_connections 10 STAT total_connections 35934023 STAT connection_structures 190 STAT cmd_get 650171241 STAT cmd_set 69561685 STAT cmd_flush 0 STAT get_hits 649644851  c10.indd   318 c10.indd   318  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   memcache  ❘  319  STAT get_misses 526390 STAT delete_misses 0 STAT delete_hits 0 STAT incr_misses 0 STAT incr_hits 0 STAT decr_misses 0 STAT decr_hits 0 STAT cas_misses 0 STAT cas_hits 0 STAT cas_badval 0 STAT auth_cmds 0 STAT auth_errors 0 STAT bytes_read 30381363330 STAT bytes_written 3607591597981 STAT limit_maxbytes 67108864 STAT accepting_conns 1 STAT listen_disabled_num 0 STAT threads 4 STAT conn_yields 0 STAT bytes 116262 STAT curr_items 36 STAT total_items 691337 STAT evictions 0 STAT reclaimed 0  The names of most of these stats should be fairly self-explanatory. Of particular interest in these  stats are get_hits, get_misses, and evictions. A high ratio of cache misses to hits may also  imply that the cache is full, but remember that this ratio will vary over time. If the memcache server  has not been running for long, you would expect a relatively high number of misses. Evictions imply  that the cache is full, and older objects are removed to make way for newer ones.  Even more detailed stats are available for each item held in the cache by issuing stats items,  stats slab, or stats sizes.   NOTE  Although these stats can also be accessed through the APIs, talking to  memcache directly over telnet is incredibly useful to perform quick checks, or  when you write monitoring scripts. You can fi nd full details of the memcache  protocol at http:  code.sixapart.com svn memcached trunk server doc  protocol.txt.  memcache Performance and Internals  For the most part, memcache performs effi ciently, but it’s worth looking under the hood to gain a  better understanding of how it works, with a goal of troubleshooting problems when they arise.   Threading At the core of memcache is the hash table containing the cached data. Perhaps surprisingly, manag- ing and setting getting values from the hash are relatively light on the CPU usage. Most of the CPU  cycles actually go on parsing requests and formatting responses.   c10.indd   319 c10.indd   319  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   320  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  Global locking is used on the hash table, so this aspect of memcache is single-threaded.  This may  change in the future.  However, the rest of memcache is multithreaded, and you can control the  number of threads used with the -t command line option to the daemon. The default is 4 threads,  but it makes sense to raise this value to the number of CPU cores present on the system. Raising the  number of threads higher than this won’t produce any benefi ts but may well cause a degradation in  performance  because of increased context switching and lock contention .  Binary Protocol memcache supports both a binary and an ASCII protocol, and, given that request parsing uses a  signifi cant number of CPU cycles, it may be worth switching to the binary protocol  the default is  usually ASCII, but this is client API-dependent  on busy servers. Not all client APIs support the  binary protocol, but those based on libmemcached do. These include PECL memcached  but not  PECL memcache , pylibmc  Python , fauna  Ruby , and caffiene  Ruby .   Following is an example of how to enable binary protocol in PECL memcached:  $cache->setOption Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL,true ;  UDP Sockets memcache supports both TCP and User Datagram Protocol  UDP   as well as UNIX sockets, but  this is only applicable if both client and server are on the same machine . Is there any advantage  to using UDP to cut down on network overhead and CPU cycles? The answer is surprisingly “not  usually” — just the opposite, in fact. Aside from the nonreliable nature of UDP  which may not be  a huge concern over an internal network , on lightly busy memcache servers, it will also be more  CPU-intensive.  The reason for this is that, with only one UDP socket in existence, all threads must constantly  monitor it. When a request comes in, all threads wake up and attempt to read the socket. Only  one thread will be successful, and the rest will either go back to sleep, or read any other requests  waiting in the socket buffer. This constant waking and sleeping pushes up CPU load, and is really  only advantageous if the server is busy enough that there will usually be requests waiting in the  buffer. Unless the server is really busy, stick with TCP.  Memory Allocation Early versions of memcache used malloc   and free   for allocating and freeing memory, but this  tends to be ineffi cient. The result is fragmentation, and fi nding contingent blocks of memory of the  required size ends up taking longer.   Instead, more recent versions of memcache use a built-in slab allocator. This assigns memory in  blocks of varying sizes, and these blocks are re-assigned when they become empty. memcache will  attempt to use the most appropriately sized slab to hold an object, but this isn’t always possible. So,  there is more waste than with the malloc free approach.   Overall, though, slab allocation is the superior method when performance is more important than  effi ciency of memory management.  c10.indd   320 c10.indd   320  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   memcache  ❘  321  membase — memcache with Persistent Storage  One of the most common questions from new memcache users is whether the cache supports  persistent storage — and if not, why not? This is missing the point a little. memcache is, by nature,  a temporary store and was never designed to be anything else. It was inevitable, though, that hybrid  products would be developed in an attempt to merge the high performance of memcache with the  persistent, disk-based storage found in databases.  An early implementation was MemcacheDB, but development appears to have been discontinued  on that product. The current front-runner is membase. membase is probably best described as a fork  of memcache because it is essentially memcache plus persistent storage. As such, it is fully compat- ible with memcache and can be accessed using the same client APIs. The persistent storage aspect is  mostly kept hidden from the client. The client will see it as simply another memcache server — so,  there’s no need to change any client code.  Persistent Storage  Behind the scenes, though, things are a bit more complicated. When data is added or modifi ed,  the in-memory data is updated immediately, and the change is placed in a queue to be written to  disk. Control is passed back to the client, and a separate thread periodically processes the queue,  writing the changes out to disk. Although this introduces a small chance of inconsistencies   for example, if the client believes the data has been written to persistent storage, but a server crash  occurs before the queue can be processed , the queue is processed frequently enough to limit this  likelihood. It is still a great performance boost for clients. Incidentally, membase uses SQLite as the  back end for storing data.  So far, so good, but what happens when the data set is larger than the available memory? membase  uses the same strategy as memcache when new data is added. If the memory cache is full, older   LRU  items are evicted. If a client later requests an object that has been evicted, membase simply  reads it back into memory and returns the data to the client.  In fact, membase has two memory thresholds when deciding when the cache is “full”: mem_low_ wat and mem_high_wat. As the cache fi lls with data, mem_low_wat is passed, and mem_high_wat  eventually is reached. When this happens, a background process begins removing items from the  cache  after fi rst ensuring that they are not still waiting to be written to disk  until mem_low_wat is  reached. In this way, membase attempts to ensure that there will always be a small amount of free  memory for new data.  Writing to disk is naturally a lot slower than writing to memory, and, in theory, you could end  up in a situation in which mem_high_wat is reached, and new data is sent to membase faster  than it can be written to disk. In these situations, membase returns a temporary error to the client,  indicating that it should try again shortly. Lowering mem_low_wat can help prevent this scenario  from arising but also results in more disk activity in general. So, this is best avoided unless  absolutely necessary.  c10.indd   321 c10.indd   321  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   322  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  Buckets and Rebalancing  memcache’s hashing function ensures that data is spread evenly over all nodes in multiserver  setups. Unfortunately, this fails to take into account that some nodes in the pool may have more  memory than others. The usual workaround with memcache is to run multiple nodes on  servers with lots of memory. For example, rather than having node A running on server X with  a 1 GB cache, and node B running on server Y with a 512 MB cache, you run two 512 MB  nodes on server X and one 512 MB node on server Y. Although rather hackish, this results in  an effi cient use of memory.  membase goes one step better, providing automatic management  including rebalancing  of data  across multiple nodes. It does this through the use of virtual buckets. Rather than mapping  data keys to servers  as memcache does , membase maps them to buckets. A lookup table then tells  membase on which node a given bucket currently resides. This introduces an extra step for the  client because it must now perform a lookup after hashing the key. Because membase aims to be  100 percent compatible with memcache, this is a problem. But there is a solution.  Moxi  Eventually, bucket-aware client APIs should emerge, but until that time, membase provides an  embedded proxy named Moxi. The purpose of Moxi is to reroute lookups to the correct server.  The client now does not need to look up the server on which a given bucket resides. It simply  sends the lookup to membase, which performs the lookup internally and reroutes the request if  the data is not held on the local node.   A result of this is that you need to specify only one membase server in your client code — Moxi  handles the rest. This simplifi es your web code and means that if membase servers are added or  removed, no changes to your code are needed.  Moxi is about more than just rerouting requests, though. It is at the core of the management channel  used by membase to communicate between instances. When a node fails, the fi rst Moxi to detect this  pushes a message out over the management channel to all other membase instances, informing them  of the failure. Moxi also provides a small hot cache for frequently accessed resources  as if membase  weren’t already fast enough .  Replication and Failover  membase offers peer-to-peer replication  that is, all nodes are equal, and there is not the  one-way fl ow of data seen in master-slave setups  in which buckets are duplicated across  multiple nodes.  The number of replicated copies of the data is confi gurable, up to a limit of  three.  This offers some degree of safety against individual nodes failing and is all handled  transparently — no need to set up replication users, manually sync data across nodes, or worry  about broken replication.  membase Web Console  As a system administrator, you’re probably used to confi guring and managing services via the  console and tend to be a little distrustful of fl ashy web-based GUIs. After all, aren’t those GUIs   c10.indd   322 c10.indd   322  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   memcache  ❘  323  for inexperienced users who don’t like getting their hands dirty? The membase GUI challenges this  stereotype, offering a refreshingly easy way to set up and manage a membase cluster, guiding the  administrator through the installation  which is painless , and then providing a console for monitor- ing and managing the live cluster.  Figure 10-1 shows the second step of the installation process.   FIGURE 10-1  NOTE  membase also supports memcache buckets if you don’t want to have  replication and redundancy. memcache buckets are recommended for when the  system will be used for caching database queries. membase is recommended for  when the system will be used instead of a traditional database.  When installed, you can use the web console to view stats on cache usage and the health of the  system, as shown in Figure 10-2. You can even set up e-mail alerts when nodes fail-over, as shown  in Figure 10-3.  c10.indd   323 c10.indd   323  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   324  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  FIGURE 10-2  FIGURE 10-3  c10.indd   324 c10.indd   324  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   MongoDB  ❘  325  Remember, though, that membase is a decentralized system with no hierarchy of masters and slaves.  The web console is accessible from every membase node, and each is as equally in charge as the  others.  memcache is one of the most popular NoSQL solutions, and falls at one extreme of the NoSQL  scale — it is a very basic store, with no persistent storage. Although membase addresses some  of these limitations, the nature of its key-value store makes it unsuitable for mapping more complex  data types. In the following section, you learn about MongoDB, a NoSQL database that offers  many of the features of a traditional RDBMS, but was built from the ground up with scalability  and performance in mind.  MONGODB  memcache is a lightweight key-value store, a long way removed from MySQL. At the other end of  the NoSQL spectrum is MongoDB, a document-oriented database with many features similar to  traditional RMDBs. Given MongoDB’s size and rich set of features, this discussion won’t offer a  complete guide to its use. Instead, the discussion begins with a brief overview of MongoDB for new  users and then dives straight into a discussion of performance aspects, which will be more suited to  intermediate or advanced users.  NOTE  In this discussion, the names MongoDB and Mongo will be used inter- changeably. Chapter 9, “MySQL in the Network,” provides more detail on many  of the concepts used to describe MongoDB, including indexes, locking, sharding,  and replication.  Getting to Know MongoDB  MongoDB uses the familiar client-server model. Mongod is the name of the server, a network-aware  daemon that you can connect to over TCP or via a UNIX socket. Mongo ships with its own  client, and if you’re familiar with the stock MySQL command-line client, you’ll feel right at home.  Naturally, there are also APIs for all the popular programming languages.  Whereas MySQL uses the concepts of tables, rows, and fi elds, Mongo revolves around documents.  A document is composed of fi elds, not unlike the way in which an RDBMS row consists of columns.  These are binary JSON  BSON  objects of arbitrary size, which can be thought of as roughly  analogous to rows of an RDBMS table. A group of documents make up a collection, and a group  of collections make up a database.   Table 10-1 illustrates the similarities between MySQL and MongoDB.  c10.indd   325 c10.indd   325  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   326  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  TABLE 10-1:  Comparing MySQL and MongoDB  MYSQL TERM  MONGODB TERM  Database  Table  Row  Column  Join  Database  Collection  Document  Field  Embedding linking  Drawing attention to the similarities between MySQL and MongoDB is purely to help you fi nd  your footing with Mongo by relating this new terminology to something that you’re already  familiar with. However, don’t be fooled into thinking that Mongo documents are identical  to MySQL rows — there are some fundamental differences.  One such difference is that documents do not have a predefi ned list of fi elds. When you create a  table in MySQL, you defi ne the columns that should exist in it. With Mongo, you can have as  many or as few fi elds as you want. This makes it much easier to model data that does not have  consistent fi elds. Imagine trying to do this in MySQL.  The usefulness of this feature is sometimes  over-emphasized, though — in practice, most data consists of consistent fi elds, and small variations  in fi elds are easy enough to accommodate in traditional RDBMs.  As a result, there’s no need to  explicitly create databases, collections, or fi elds — just use them, and they will be created  automatically. This is an important concept, so let’s reiterate it. In Mongo, fi elds are a property  of the document and are independent of other documents in the collection.  The Mongo Shell  As with MySQL, Mongo ships with its own command-line client; although plenty of other  clients are available. The client is named mongo, and executes JavaScript — it’s actually based on the  SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine used in Firefox.  See Chapter 6, “JavaScript, the Document Object  Model, and Ajax,” for more details on SpiderMonkey.  By default, the client will attempt to connect  to 28017 TCP  mongod’s default port  on the localhost, but you can easily override this. Following is  an example:  $ mongo MongoDB shell version: 2.0.2 connecting to: test > db.foo.save  { "name" : "Oscar" , "species" : "hamster", "weight" :       "154", "fur color" : "charcoal" } ; > db.foo.save  { "name" : "Jasper" , "species" : "dwarf hamster",       "weight" : 47, "fur color" : "white" } ; > db.foo.save  { "name" : "Dasiy" , "species" : "cat", "weight" :       2000, "fur color" : "black" } ; > db.foo.save  { "name" : "Stef" , "species" : "human", "height" :       158, "weight" : 112, "hair color" : "black" } ;  c10.indd   326 c10.indd   326  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   MongoDB  ❘  327  This code connects to the mongo shell and issues four insert commands. Note that the database or  collection hasn’t been formally created, nor have any fi elds been defi ned. The data is simply added.  Also, note the variation in fi elds. For human, an extra column for "height" has been added, and  "hair color" is used rather than "fur color".  With this sample data in place, you can now search it, as shown here:  > db.foo.find  {"species" : "dwarf hamster"} ; { "_id" : ObjectId "4f20666b7e657e5d56c29f60" , "name" : "Jasper",       "species" : "dwarf hamster", "weight" : 47, "fur color" : "white" }  Because you didn’t specify an index fi eld, Mongo kindly added one for you. This can be thought of  as similar to primary keys in MySQL — every collection needs an _id, and it must be unique for  each document.   One powerful feature of Mongo is its support for nested data structures, and a fi eld can itself be an  array. Let’s rewrite the original insert queries to list the foods that each animal eats  for clarity, the  other fi elds have been taken out .  > db.foo.save  { "name" : Oscar" , "foods : ["carrot", "grape", "apple"] } ; > db.foo.save  { "name" : "Jasper" , "foods" :  ["carrot", "grape",       "human fingers"] } ; > db.foo.save  { "name" : "Daisy" , "foods" : ["tuna", "chicken", " mouse"] } ; > db.foo.save  { "name" : "Stef" , " foods" : [" salad", " rice pudding",       "pizza"] } ;  You can now easily search for any animal that likes "carrot":  > db.foo.find {foods : "carrot"} ; { "_id" : ObjectId "4f211f1420229f6e98652b15" , "name" : "Oscar",       "foods" : [ "carrot", "grape", "apple" ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "4f211f1420229f6e98652b16" , "name" : "Jasper",       "foods" : [ "carrot", "grape", "human fingers" ] }  NOTE  It’s perhaps worth pausing to consider how you would do something  similar in MySQL. Although there’s nothing to stop you from serializing the  array of foods and storing them in a MySQL column, the preferred way would be  to normalize the data to some degree. In a second table, you would list the food  type along with the ID of the animal that ate it.   Drivers  To use Mongo in your applications, an API or driver is needed. Although numerous drivers are  available for PHP, the standard is called Mongo, which is available via PECL. Rewriting the previous  search query in the object-oriented syntax of the PHP Mongo driver yields the following:  $r = new Mongo  ; $database = $r->test; $collection = $database->foo;  c10.indd   327 c10.indd   327  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   328  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  $cursor = $collection->find array 'species' => 'dwarf hamster'  ;  foreach  $cursor as $row  {     var_dump $row ; }  Naturally, drivers are available for most other popular languages, too, including C C++, Perl,  Python, and Ruby.  MongoDB Performance  The last few pages have served as a brief introduction to MongoDB. If you were unfamiliar with  it, hopefully this has whetted your appetite, and provided enough information for you to decide  whether Mongo is something you want to explore in more detail. There are plenty of excellent  Mongo resources available — in particular, the offi cial website  www.mongodb.org  and the freely  available The Little MongoDB Book  a free e-book written by Karl Seguin .  The remainder of this section focuses on specifi c performance aspects of Mongo and assumes that  you already have a decent understanding of how to use Mongo in applications. It doesn’t assume  that you’re a wizard, but rather that you’re comfortable with the core functionality — adding  removing searching, as well as the concepts of collections, documents, and fi elds.  Indexing  Indexes in Mongo work much like they do in MySQL. You can add them to fi elds, and they improve  lookup performance when you search on these fi elds.  To create an index on the previous animals collection example, use the following:  db.foo.ensureIndex {species:1} ;  The 1 here means to create the index in ascending order, whereas -1 would mean descending. For  single indexes like this, the direction is unimportant, but after you get to compound indexes, it can  matter.  ensureIndex optionally takes the following four additional parameters:   ➤ background — Run the index creation in the background  for example,   db.foo.ensureIndex {species:1}, {background: true} ; .   ➤ dropDups — If any documents contain identical values for the index fi eld, drop all but the   fi rst occurrence.   ➤ unique — Mongo won’t allow a document to be inserted if the indexed fi eld matches an  existing index. If the document doesn’t contain the indexed fi eld, this is treated as a null  value. So, with unique indexes, only one document is permitted not to contain the indexed  fi eld.   ➤ Sparse — In situations in which many of the documents do not contain the indexed fi eld,   using sparse indexes stops these nonmatching documents from appearing in the index, thus  saving space.  c10.indd   328 c10.indd   328  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   MongoDB  ❘  329  From a performance perspective, background creation is perhaps the most interesting operation.  Usually, indexes are created in the foreground, but this causes read write access on the whole  database to block for the duration. By telling Mongo to generate an index in the background, you  can avoid this locking.   There’s no such thing as a free lunch, though. Background indexing takes longer, and may still  impact performance to some degree, even if it isn’t causing locking. In addition, the algorithm that  background indexing uses makes heavy use of RAM. If the newly created index is bigger than the  amount of available memory, background creation will be slow.  Compound indexes are also supported with the following syntax:  db.foo.ensureIndex {x:1, y:1, z:1} ;  As with MySQL, order is important. In this example, the index will be useable if you are querying  on fi elds x, x and y, or x and y and z — but not y, z, or y and z. Compound indexes are useful, but  think carefully about the ordering.  The usual caveats about indexes also apply here. When data is added, deleted, or updated,  indexes must be modifi ed. So, on collections that are write-heavy, the overhead of maintaining  the indexes may well outweigh the benefi ts.   Mongo uses B-trees for indexes, too. An interesting side-effect of this is that index values have an  impact on performance. If entries are inserted into the B-tree at random locations, this increases  disk seeks, and the whole index must be restructured each time. If you simply append entries to  the right side of the B-tree each time, no further work must be done. This has an impact when you  choose unique IDs. For example, it would be better for performance to choose an ascending numeric  value  such as a UNIX timestamp  than, say, a hash of another fi eld.  Blindly adding indexes creates unnecessary overhead, so ensure that an index will actually be useful  before adding it. As with MySQL, Mongo works most effi ciently when all indexes fi t into memory.  So, on large collections, it may be necessary to rethink your indexing strategy to keep the size down.  The index size for a given collection can be obtained via db.foo.totalIndexSize  .  In particular, be aware of indexes that offer low selectivity and do not effi ciently narrow down the docu- ments to search. For example, if a fi eld has a binary yes no state, adding an index would likely still leave  a large number of documents to scan. Creating a compound including the fi eld is one possible solution.  Mongo will use only one index on a query. So, if you search on multiple fi elds, multiple indexes are  of no benefi t. Either choose the most suitable fi eld to index  think selectivity and fi eld size , or create  a compound index.  Explaining Queries  When diagnosing a slow query, the explain   method can be invaluable and provides a breakdown  of documents scanned, indexes used, and locking. Here’s how explain    looks for a query on the  sample animals collection with no indexes in place:  > db.foo.find  {"species" : "dwarf hamster"} .explain  ; {                                                                "cursor" : "BasicCursor",                                "nscanned" : 4,                                   c10.indd   329 c10.indd   329  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   330  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS          "nscannedObjects" : 4,                                   "n" : 1,                                                 "millis" : 34,                                           "nYields" : 0,                                           "nChunkSkips" : 0,                                       "isMultiKey" : false,                                    "indexOnly" : false,                                     "indexBounds" : {                                         } }    The meaning of these fi elds follows:   ➤ cursor — This is the cursor used for the scan — BasicCursor when the collection is   scanned directly, and BtreeCursor when an index is used.   ➤ nscanned — This is the number of items scanned, including indexes and documents.   ➤ nscannedObjects — This is the number of documents scanned.   ➤ n — This is the number of matching documents.   ➤ millis — This tells how many milliseconds the query took to run.   ➤ nYields — This is the number of times that the query was interrupted to allow writes to   execute.   ➤ nChunkSkips — During automatic sharding, skipped chunks indicate that data is actively   being moved from one node to another.    ➤ isMultiKey — This indicates whether a multikey  that is, compound  index was used.   ➤ indexOnly — This will be set to true if a query can be answered simply from the index    ➤ indexBounds — If an index is used, this shows the name of the index and the key searched    that is, a covering index .  for in it.  Let’s add an index to the species fi eld and rerun explain   :  > db.foo.ensureIndex {species:1} ; > db.foo.find  {"species" : "dwarf hamster"} .explain  ; {         "cursor" : "BtreeCursor species_1",         "nscanned" : 1,         "nscannedObjects" : 1,         "n" : 1,         "millis" : 0,         "nYields" : 0,         "nChunkSkips" : 0,         "isMultiKey" : false,         "indexOnly" : false,         "indexBounds" : {                 "species" : [  c10.indd   330 c10.indd   330  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   MongoDB  ❘  331                          [                                 "dwarf hamster",                                 "dwarf hamster"                         ]                 ]         } }  This time, the cursor fi eld tells you that an index was used — an ascending index on the species fi eld   species_1 , to be precise. Only one row was scanned this time, and the execution time appears to  be lower; although, clearly, zero milliseconds can’t be right  most likely it is a result of the time  having been rounded down .  Proﬁ ling and Slow Queries  Through its profi ling system, Mongo enables you to log queries for all operations, or those taking  longer than a certain number of milliseconds. This can be enabled via the Mongo shell, as shown  here:  > db.setProfilingLevel 1,20 ;  Or you can enable this at the command line when launching mongod, as shown here:   mongod --profile=1 --slowms=15  Three profi le levels are supported:    ➤ 0 disables logging.   ➤ 1 enables logging of slow queries.   ➤ 2 enables logging of all queries.   When profile=1 is chosen, the slow query time  in milliseconds  may also be specifi ed. Otherwise,  it defaults to 100 milliseconds, which is more than high enough — in practice, though, a lower  value is usually desirable.  Log entries are stored in the profile collection  a capped collection  of the system database and  can be accessed like so:   > db.system.profile.find  ; { "ts" : ISODate "2012-01-31T22:41:57.330Z" , "op" : "insert", "ns" :       "test.foobar", "millis" : 89, "client" : "127.0.0.1", "user" : "" } { "ts" : ISODate "2012-01-31T22:41:57.348Z" , "op" : "insert", "ns" :       "test.foobar", "millis" : 64, "client" : "127.0.0.1", "user" : "" } { "ts" : ISODate "2012-01-31T22:41:57.357Z" , "op" : "insert", "ns" :       "test.foobar", "millis" : 37, "client" : "127.0.0.1", "user" : "" }  Along with a timestamp, you see the operation type  insert , the namespace being operated on   test.foobar , and the time that the query took.  c10.indd   331 c10.indd   331  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   332  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  Usually you want to be more specifi c, though — for example, to show queries on a particular  database or collection, or those taking over a certain time to run. The following shows queries  taking longer than 10 milliseconds to run:  db.system.profile.find  { millis : { $gt : 10 } }  ;  Any queries you run on the profi le collection will also be logged. If you inspect the log now, sorted  by most recent fi rst, the previous find query will now be shown:  > db.system.profile.find  .sort {$natural:-1} ; { "ts" : ISODate "2012-01-31T22:42:12.229Z" , "op" : "query", "ns" :       "test.system.profile", "query" : { }, "nscanned" : 40, "nreturned" :       40, "responseLength" : 3900, "millis" : 23, "client" : "127.0.0.1",       "user" : "" }  In the case of read operations  that is, queries , additional information is shown. nscanned shows  the number of documents that were scanned, nreturned the number that matched  and were  returned , whereas responseLength is the size  in bytes  of the response.  For brevity only the fi rst  line of output is shown, but there were another 19 lines.   There’s a lot that you can learn from the profi ler. At its most basic level, it provides an idea of  the average query response time, and whether particular queries are problematic. If the  responseLength is large, this equates to a large amount of data being sent to the client, which  will obviously slow things down. If the number of documents scanned is signifi cantly higher than  the number returned, this indicates that Mongo must do a lot of searching to return a modest  number of matches. This is a strong indication that an index of the searched column would be  benefi cial.  Locking and Concurrency  In Mongo, locks are implemented globally. Thus, a write lock can cause all databases to  be locked — not just the current database or collection. This contrasts with the table- and row-level  locking offered by MySQL’s MyISAM and InnoDB. Collection-level locking is currently being worked  on, but until then, the only real solution if you are affected by this global locking is to spread out  databases across multiple mongod instances on the same host.  Despite this, concurrency in Mongo is usually good, partly because Mongo uses a method  to periodically yield the locks on slow-running queries so that other queries may run. This makes  perfect sense in many cases. You’re usually quite happy for a long write query to be interrupted  so that  usually  short-running read queries can execute.  Aside from periodic yielding of locks, Mongo can also yield when a minor page fault is detected.  This effectively interrupts the query because the operating system must read the data into memory  from disk, and Mongo uses this time to allow other read queries to run.  The Process List  Just as MySQL gives you the ability to view a list of currently running processes via  show processlist, Mongo offers db.currentOp  ; for the same purpose:  c10.indd   332 c10.indd   332  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   MongoDB  ❘  333  > db.currentOp  ; {         "inprog" : [                 {                         "opid" : 44024,                         "active" : true,                         "lockType" : "write",                         "waitingForLock" : false,                         "secs_running" : 0,                         "op" : "insert",                         "ns" : "test.foobar",                         "query" : {                          },                         "client" : "127.0.0.1:44084",                         "desc" : "conn",                         "threadId" : "0x7fdb6c7f6710",                         "connectionId" : 2,                         "numYields" : 0                 }         ] }  This example shows a single connection from a local client. The client has a write lock  lockType   and performs an insert  op  on the foobar collection in the test database  ns, namespace . active  indicates whether the query is queued, whereas query holds the query being executed in the case of  reads.  You can also kill queries using db.killOp 123 , where 123 is the op ID. A value of conn in the  desc fi eld indicates that the query is a standard client query. Other values indicate system queries   for example, replication, sharding, or indexing , and you probably don’t want to kill these.  Data Integrity, Journaling, and Single-Server Durability  One frequent criticism of Mongo is that it does not offer single-server durability — that is,  performance is given a higher priority than the integrity of data. This isn’t quite true. Mongo  does offer some degree of single-server durability. It’s just that it isn’t the primary focus and must  explicitly be enabled. Even then, though, it is not as powerful as, say, the InnoDB transaction log.  NOTE  In their defense, the Mongo developers have a number of reasons for this  apparent Achilles’ heel, which you may read about at http:  blog.mongodb .org post 381927266 what-about-durability.   Mongo is designed for scalability, and the expectation is that it will usually run inside a replication  cluster. In that situation, the data is stored on multiple nodes, and the failure of one node is not seri- ous. Providing a high degree of data integrity also carries a signifi cant performance price associated  with the InnoDB transaction log and the use of memory in disk controllers to buffer disk writes. The  bottom line is that Mongo would not offer the blazing performance that it does if single-server data   c10.indd   333 c10.indd   333  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   334  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  integrity were a necessity. There’s nothing inherently wrong with this, but you should just be aware  of it.  One reason for Mongo’s speed when writing data is that it immediately returns control to the  client, without waiting until the status of the write can be determined  for example, failure or  success . Data is not synced to disk immediately either, and it may be several seconds before the  data is fi nally committed. Both of these factors can make benchmarking somewhat diffi cult   and other people’s benchmarks grossly inaccurate  because data may still be written to disk after  the benchmarking fi nishes. If you call getLastError   after issuing a write, this will cause the  data to be synced to disk because this is necessary to determine if any errors occurred.  You can control how often Mongo fsyncs to disk using the --syncdelay option when launching  mongod. This currently defaults to 60 seconds. But this potentially means up to 60 seconds of data  being lost following a crash, and this is too high for many situations. On the other hand, syncing,  say, every second, is going to hurt performance and may well be unnecessary the majority of the  time. You need to sync only following an important write. On a mostly read setup, using fsync  every x seconds is an unnecessary overhead.  There is a solution to this problem, however. You can manually ask Mongo to fsync as and when  needed. To do this, you would use the following shell commands:  use admin db.runCommand {fsync:1} ;  Naturally, you can also fsync in your web code via the mongo driver. Of course, this could mean  substantial rewrites to existing code, but if a database abstraction layer is used, the changes should  be minimal.  Syncing isn’t the only solution, though. Mongo version 1.7.5 introduced write-ahead journaling;  although, it was not enabled by default until version 1.9.2. With journaling, operations are  written to the log prior to being executed, and if a crash occurs, the journal can be replayed.  In many ways, this is similar to the MySQL binary log. If the server crashes, on restart, Mongo  automatically replays the journal prior to accepting client connections.  Journal fi les are stored under the journal subdirectory of the data directory. In some cases, they will  be pre-allocated — so don’t be too surprised if a journal fi le is unexpectedly large.  On 32-bit systems, journaling is disabled by default because of overhead, but on 64-bit architec- tures, it is now enabled by default.   Backups  Another advantage of journaling is that it makes backing up data easier. On storage systems,  such as the Logical Volume Manager  LVM  or the Z fi lesystem  zfs , all you must do is take a  snapshot of everything under the data path. Remember, though, that it’s not safe to do this on other  fi lesystems — the data fi les mostly likely will not be in sync, and corruption will occur.  The other route for backups is via mongodump, a command-line application that generates hot  backups of Mongo databases in a binary format. The data can subsequently be imported using  mongorestore.  c10.indd   334 c10.indd   334  05 11 12   4:52 PM 05 11 12   4:52 PM   MongoDB  ❘  335  db.serverStatus    Mongo exposes a wealth of information about the current state of the system via the  db.serverStatus   command. The full output is too long to show here, but following are  some of the most important parts.  Consider the following example:          "globalLock" : {                 "totalTime" : 130507162615,                 "lockTime" : 312085,                 "ratio" : 0.000002391324688597054,                 "currentQueue" : {                         "total" : 0,                         "readers" : 0,                         "writers" : 0                 },  Recall that Mongo uses global locking when inserting data  unlike the table- or row-level locking  offered by MySQL’s MyISAM and InnoDB . These counters show how long the server has been up,  how much of this time has been spent with the global lock in place, and the ratio of these two  numbers. Although Mongo’s strategy of yielding locks on long-running queries helps to lessen the  problems caused by high levels of global locking, a high lock ratio is still a cause for concern and  will impact both reads and writes. One of the most common causes is a shortage of RAM, which  causes the system to start paging.  The currentQueue counters indicate how many operations are queued up waiting for locks   total, read locks, write locks, respectively .          "connections" : {                 "current" : 7,                 "available" : 812         },  Naturally, if your current number of connections is regularly approaching the available limit,  there is the possibility of clients being turned away. Reaching this limit is much less of a problem  than it is in MySQL, and you rarely need to increase the limit.  Consider the following example:          "indexCounters" : {                 "btree" : {                         "accesses" : 1478,                         "hits" : 1473,                         "misses" : 5,                         "missRatio" : 0                 }         }  The fi rst value shown in this example is the number of times that an index has been accessed.  Elsewhere in the stats is a section named opcounters that shows how many inserts, queries,   c10.indd   335 c10.indd   335  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   336  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  updates, and deletes have been performed. It can be useful to compare these fi gures to see how many  queries have been hitting indexes. Although there are sometimes valid reasons for not indexing,  you’d generally want to see most of your queries utilizing an index.  The hits and misses counters refer to whether the index was found in memory.   As discussed earlier, you can instruct Mongo to fsync data to disk every few seconds, or only  when instructed. The following counters show the number of fl ushes, the total time it has taken,  the average time, and the most recent time. High times here would indicate either large volumes of  data written out or high levels of contention on the disks.          "backgroundFlushing" : {                 "flushes" : 2175,                 "total_ms" : 83,                 "average_ms" : 0.03816091954022988,                 "last_ms" : 0,  When committing to the journal  if journaling is enabled , operations are written in groups to  improve performance. By default, the gap between these commits is 100 milliseconds; although it  can be changed at start up  --journalCommitInterval   . Consider the following  example:          "dur" : {                 "commits" : 30,                 "journaledMB" : 0,                 "writeToDataFilesMB" : 0,                 "earlyCommits" : 0,                 "timeMs" : {                         "dt" : 3072,                         "prepLogBuffer" : 0,                         "writeToJournal" : 0,                         "writeToDataFiles" : 0,                         "remapPrivateView" : 0                 }         }  In this example, commits shows the number of commits that were performed in this interval,  whereas journaledMB shows the number of megabytes of data written again during this interval.  Note that although Mongo usually honors journalCommitInterval, if a large amount of data  must be written, it commits before the interval has passed — this is refl ected in an increase in  earlyCommits, whereas timeMs.dt shows the time interval used for the most recent set of stats.  The remaining timeMs fi elds show the time spent preparing to write to the journal   prepLogBuffer , writing to the journal  writeToJournal , writing to data fi les after the  journaling  has completed  writeToDataFiles , and remapping any affected memory regions. Again, high  values for these fi rst three are a good indication of disk bottlenecks.  mongostat  An alternative tool for gathering statistics is mongostat, which produces a vmstat-like output, with  a new line of output appended every second.  c10.indd   336 c10.indd   336  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   MongoDB  ❘  337  $ mongostat connected to: 127.0.0.1 insert  query update delete getmore command flushes mapped  vsize    res faults  locked % idx miss %     qrqw   araw  netIn netOut  conn       time       0      0      0      0       0       1       0   208m   626m    32m      0         0          0       00     00    62b     1k     1   19:23:32       0      0      0      0       0       1       0   208m   626m    32m      0         0          0       00     00    62b     1k     1   19:23:33       0      0      0      0       0       1       0   208m   626m    32m      0         0          0       00     00    62b     1k     1   19:23:34   NOTE  Although less information is contained in the output, it’s easier to read  than the output of db.serverStatus  and is more suitable for watching a live  server.  The column names should mostly be self-explanatory. The fi rst six columns show counters for the  types of query executed, whereas flushes lists how many fsyncs have been performed in the last  second  since the previous line of output . mapped, vsize, and res relate to memory usage — the  amount of mapped memory, the virtual size of the mongod process, and its residual size.  locked is the percentage of the time that a global lock has been in place  again, over the last  second , whereas idx miss gives the percentage of B-tree misses — identical to the missRatio seen  in the output of db.serverStatus  .  The next two columns give the query backlog for reads and writes, and the number of clients  performing reads writes. This is followed by the volume of network traffi c fl owing in and out, and  the number of client connections. If the server is part of a replication set, an additional two columns  show the replica set name and the node’s role  for example, master, slave, secondary, and so on .  One useful feature of mongostat is the --autodiscover option, which causes it to search for other  nodes in the cluster and query them for stats. Each update of the mongostat output then contains  one line for each node discovered.  Schema Design and Joins  In a traditional relational database, the “right” way to organize data is in the third normal form   3NF . This is certainly the most aesthetically pleasing structure, but it typically results in the  need to join across many tables, which is something you can’t do in Mongo.  You might often  deviate from 3NF in traditional databases, too, for performance reasons.  Mongo isn’t a traditional  RDBMS, though, and you must rethink what you’ve learned about database structures. Rather than  simply looking at the data and deciding how it should be structured, you should look at how the  data will be accessed.  In some ways, the lack of support for joins is a good thing. It forces developers to create  scalable  structures that can later be sharded more easily. If you’ve ever attempted to shard an existing  MySQL-based application, you know that this can involve rewriting lots of code. With Mongo,  there isn’t the potential to go down this scalability dead end.   c10.indd   337 c10.indd   337  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   338  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  Of course, you can still implement joins in a primitive, client-side fashion. Imagine a video-sharing  site such as YouTube. In a classic RDBMS, each video would probably exist as a row in a table,  with a column for the user ID of the owner, while another table would store the list of categories  to which this video belonged. To display a video, you’d link against the user and categories tables  so that you could list the owner’s username, show his or her location, show the categories to which  the video belonged, and so on.  In Mongo, you’d need to break this down into three steps:    1.   Send a query to retrieve the required columns from the videos collection  owner ID, video  duration, video title, and so on .    2.  Use the user ID obtained from the fi rst query to fetch the owner’s username, location, and   so on.    3.   Perform a query on the categories collection, matching on the video’s ID.  Sending these extra queries increases latency a bit, and, in some cases, can cause a substantial  increase in network traffi c. So, although this method isn’t “wrong,” it’s not optimal either. Using  client-side joins in this way also shows that you are still thinking like an RDBMS programmer — it’s  not the Mongo way to do things.  What if you were to store the owner’s username and location as fi elds in the videos collection   as well as in the users collection ? Denormalizing tricks like this make updates more diffi cult.   If a user changes username, you must update entries in the videos collection.  However,  denormalization removes the need for joins and makes things easier to scale. There’s no right or  wrong way to do things here, and decisions like this must be made on a per-case basis.  Mongo also offers two features that can reduce the need for joins: linking and embedding. Linking  is achieved using the DBRef mechanism in which you store a reference to a document in another  collection. This necessitates a follow-up query, and most of the time, DBRefs simply aren’t needed,  because you can simply perform the join manually.  Much more interesting is the capability to embed documents inside others. For example, using the  video-sharing example, you could embed each video owner’s user document inside a video docu- ment. This provides quick access to data relating to the video’s owner, at the expense of disk space.  Mongo makes it easy to scan and update embedded documents, and this is generally the best option  for performance.  Another consideration when designing schema is the way in which documents are physically stored  on disk. Imagine a collection containing ten10 documents, each 1 KB in size. Mongo ensures that  each document will always be stored sequentially, so the disk will not need to seek multiple times to  read a single document. However, reading in all the documents will likely require seeking to te10n  different locations  unless two documents just happen to have been placed next to each other on  disk .  Data is loaded into memory in 4-KB blocks  the default page size , so if you want to read all te10n  documents into memory, each document takes up a 4-KB block, and you end up using 40 KB of  memory, not 10 KB. However, if each document was placed sequentially on disk, the 10 KB of data  would fi t into three pages, and you’d only need 12 KB of memory. Because you’ve already seen that   c10.indd   338 c10.indd   338  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   MongoDB  ❘  339  an individual document will be stored sequentially on disk, you can achieve the wanted effect by  embedding the 10 documents inside another document — a process known as document bundling.  This can signifi cantly cut disk seeks and memory usage under certain circumstances.  Document bundling has the most impact for documents that are small because the minimum unit of  currency is a 4-KB page of memory. As the size of the document increases, the percentage gain from  using bundling decreases. Also, bundling assumes that you actually want to read all the embedded  documents into memory, which isn’t always the case. This technique is only helpful if your working  set is too large to fi t into memory; otherwise, there is nothing to be gained.  Replication  Replication is a big topic in the world of MongoDB, and although it has many similarities with  MySQL, it is substantially more involved. Actually, earlier versions of Mongo did use a fairly primi- tive master-slave replication model, which was similar to MySQL’s, but this has been superseded by  a more advanced method called replica sets.  In Mongo, a replication group is called a replica set, and may contain between 3 and 12 members.  At any time, only one node will be the primary, with the others  usually  acting as secondaries and  slaving the primary’s contents. Reads can go to any node, whereas writes naturally must go to the  primary.  Replication Internals and the Oplog  The process to replicate from one node to another is similar to MySQL’s use of replay logs. On the  primary node, all write events are executed by Mongo, and then written to the oplog, which is a  capped collection in the local database. Each secondary node listens to the primary’s oplog and  copies events over to its own oplog. A separate thread on the secondary then replays events from its  own oplog.  As a result of the oplog being a capped collection, only a limited amount of history is stored,  and there is always the danger that a secondary node will fall so far behind that the primary has  removed entries from the oplog that the secondary has not yet replicated. If this happens,  replication to the secondary node stops, and manual intervention is required.  The usual cause of replication lag in Mongo is network latency, but for a particularly write-heavy  application, lack of server power can also be an issue. In the former case, you simply must ensure  that the oplog is large enough to accommodate this, whereas in the latter, more powerful hardware  is the only option.  In addition, it is preferable that the oplog be large enough that you can reboot a secondary server  without the current oplog events having been rotated out by the time it comes back online. This  way, when you need to carry out operating system or hardware upgrades, the Mongo secondary  server can still catch up with its primary server when you bring it back online.  There’s no way you can create hard-and-fast rules on how big the oplog collection should be,  though, because it depends on how Mongo is used. For a write-heavy application, the oplog may  fi ll up so quickly that you can’t tolerate more than 10 seconds of latency — anything more and old  log entries will be rotated out before secondary servers have read them. Conversely, a read-heavy   c10.indd   339 c10.indd   339  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   340  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  application may generate so little write traffi c that the oplog holds several hours’ worth of  operations.   In reality, most applications lie somewhere in between and may suffer from occasional spurts of  heavy write activity. In this case, the oplog would be more than large enough most of the time but  could occasionally be too small.   The good news is that a large oplog doesn’t have a particular impact on performance, so it’s safe to  err on the size of caution and make it big. For example, the following shows the use of a 10 GB cap:  mongod --oplogSize 10240   Setting Up Replication  mongod --replSet    > rs.initiate   > rs.add "r1.example.com" ; > rs.add "r2.example.com" ;  Confi guring a replica set in Mongo is relatively simple. First, you start up each mongod instance with  the --replSet option, as shown here:   In this example, setname is an arbitrary name of your choosing for the set. On the fi rst server, you  then initiate the set and add the hostnames of other nodes in the set, as shown here:  Various confi guration options may be passed to rs.add, including priority and whether the node is  to act as an arbiter  used when a new primary node must be selected  . Following is an example:  > rs.add "r1.example.com", arbiterOnly: true ;  If you start with an empty data set, this is all that needs to be done. For existing data, you must load  in a copy of the data into each node using mongodump and mongorestore.   Using Replication Nodes  In a replication setup, you generally write to the primary node and distribute reads over the second- ary nodes. Unless you have a particularly elegant means to provide the information dynamically,  this means hard-coding the addresses of the primary and master servers into the application’s  confi guration, and then rewriting certain queries so that they go to a secondary server.  Mongo uses a much more fl exible method that enables it to dynamically query nodes for their status,  and discover the existence of other nodes in the set. In your code, you supply a list of host:port  pairs to the driver, which then connects to each  ideally in parallel  and sends an ismaster    command. As well as returning the node’s status  whether it sees itself as a primary, secondary, or  neither , it also returns a list of all other hosts in the replica set. In this way, the Mongo driver can  learn the topology of the set without you explicitly listing every member.  This auto-discovery adds some unfortunate latency to the queries, and some drivers implement  short-term caching. This in itself can be a source of problems if the primary server goes down and   c10.indd   340 c10.indd   340  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   MongoDB  ❘  341  a new one is elected — the last thing you want to do is send write queries to a secondary server.  Fortunately, when a new primary is elected, this is usually because the old primary is not respond- ing, so it will not accept any writes anyway. In addition, you can use connection pooling in some  drivers  for example, PHP’s  to reduce the latency involved in connecting to each node.  After the driver has discovered which node is a primary and which are secondary, you can simply  execute your queries, and they will automatically be routed to the primary. Alternatively, you can  request that queries go to a slave by setting the slaveOkay option. Exact details on how to do this  vary from driver to driver. But, in PHP, you can set it on a per-query basis, for a particular  database collection, or for the whole connection. Following is an example:  $r->foo->bar->find  ->slaveOkay  ;  The PHP driver determines which slave to use based on ping time. A health check is sent every 5  seconds, and the secondary node with the lowest ping time will be the preferred one. Remember that  Mongo uses eventual consistency, and if data is written to the primary node, there may be a short  delay before it propagates to all slaves. Thus, in some cases, using a secondary node for read queries  is not appropriate.  Failover: Elections, Voting, and Arbiters  One of the many great features of replica sets is the support for automatic failover. Each node routinely  sends a heartbeat message to the others in the set, and if a secondary node detects that the primary  node is down, it forces an election. During an election, each node votes on the node it believes should  be the new primary. This is mainly based on which server is the most up-to-date with replicating from  the primary, but it also takes into account any custom priority you have set on nodes.  One consequence of this democratic approach is that occasionally there will be voting ties.  That is,  no node receives a majority vote.  Mongo makes allowances for this through the concept of arbiters.  These are nodes in the replica set that don’t hold any data  that is, don’t participate in replication   and are used solely for breaking voting deadlocks. An arbiter is needed only when there are an even  number of replication nodes  because an odd number of voters can’t result in a tie , and arbiters are  light enough that you can run them on the same machine as a replication node. For a given replica  set, you generally need only one arbiter  at most , and there is no additional benefi t to running  multiple arbiters.  To add an arbiter, simply start up a replica set member in the usual way  by starting mongod with  the --replicaSet   command-line option , and then tell the primary node to treat it as an  arbiter. Following is an example:  > rs.addArb "server1.example.com:27017" ;  Priority  Mongo version 2.0 introduced the capability to set priorities on each node in a replica set. If the  primary goes down, and a replacement must be found, Mongo favors the most up-to-date server.  If several servers are up-to-date, the one with the highest priority will be chosen. A consequence  of this is that the primary node may change again at a later date if a server with higher priority   c10.indd   341 c10.indd   341  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   342  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  subsequently becomes less lagged. For example, you would use the following to change the priority  of the fi rst node to 2:  > config.members[1].priority = 2;  Setting priority has several uses. For example, if you have a set of three replica servers, two in the  same data center and one on the other side of the world being used for taking backups, you prob- ably don’t want the latter to ever become primary. You can do that by giving it a priority of zero.  Similarly, priority can be used to ensure that the most powerful servers are favored as primaries.  Propagation and Eventual Consistency  Recall that write operations in Mongo immediately return control back to the client, without saying  anything about whether the write was a success  or had even been attempted yet . In the majority  of cases, the write will be successful but will be queued for a short period of time before being  committed to disk.   In replication setups, you have additional considerations. The write may have been committed to  disk on the primary, but what about secondaries? You know that they will eventually receive and  commit the write  depending on any replication lag and use of fsync , but sometimes that isn’t good  enough.   Earlier in this chapter, you learned that getLastError   forces Mongo to commit a write to disk.   That’s the only way it can return whether an error occurred.  The syntax can be extended for  replica sets, as shown here:  db.runCommand  { getlasterror : 1 , w : 2 }  ;  The w parameter tells Mongo that the operation must have been written to at least two nodes before  getLastError will return. One node will be the current one  primary , whereas the other will be a  secondary. In the case of sensitive data, this should provide some reassurance that it will not be lost.   As shown here, w also supports the majority keyword, which causes getLastError to return when  the majority of secondaries receive the operation:  db.runCommand  { getlasterror : 1 , w : "majority" }  ;  This usually provides a satisfactory level of comfort. Ensuring that every node has the data is unnec- essary and costly because the speed at which the command returns is effectively governed by the  slowest secondary in the set. When all the nodes are in the same data center, this isn’t too bad. But  for a secondary on another continent, this could cause some annoying latency. Thus, a timeout value  is also supported, as shown here:  db.runCommand  { getlasterror : 1 , w : "majority", wtimeout : 3000 }  ;  In this example, Mongo waits for the majority of servers to receive the write and returns a timeout if  this has not happened within 3 seconds.  c10.indd   342 c10.indd   342  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   MongoDB  ❘  343  Sharding  Given that Mongo was designed from the outset to provide high-performance, multinode data  storage, it’s not surprising that it features particularly strong support for sharding. With automatic  rebalancing, built-in lookup tables and routing, and support for parallel querying, Mongo simplifi es  many of the obstacles encountered with sharding in MySQL.   The main reason for sharding is to scale write queries  scaling reads is easy , but there are also a  number of other  lesser  reasons:   ➤ For large amounts of data, it may be that a single server doesn’t offer enough disk capacity   to hold everything.  Although, given the size of modern hard disks, this isn’t going to  happen often.    ➤ When searching large collections, sharding can also improve performance by querying each   shard in parallel and then aggregating the results.    ➤ Sharding increases the overall amount of memory available in the cluster, meaning that   more data can be cached in RAM, thus improving read performance.  Chunks and Shards  In MySQL, each range of key values is referred to as a shard and exists on its own separate physical  server. Thus, keys a-j might exist on one shard, k-t on another shard, and u-z on another. Each of  these ranges directly translates to a particular MySQL server.  With Mongo, the basic unit of currency is the chunk. A chunk contains a range of key values   for example, k through t  but is not tied to a particular physical server. Rather, it can be moved  across servers  which are referred to as shards  as necessary. Chunks are fairly small in size, and  each shard usually contains many chunks.   So, in addition to a slight change in nomenclature, Mongo also introduces an extra degree of  granularity. This is a signifi cant improvement over MySQL’s mode, in which ranges are tied to a  physical server.  Choosing a Shard Key  Sharding is performed on a per-collection basis, enabling you to mix and match. Large collections  can be sharded, whereas smaller ones continue to operate on a single server.   As always, you should give some thought to the shard key, and you must ensure that it has a high  degree of cardinality. For example, there would be no point to shard a user collection based on  gender because this would produce only two shards. When your application outgrew two shards,  you’d be stuck. Similarly, if you were to shard based on a user’s surname, you could end up with  quite an uneven distribution of data — there are a lot more Smiths and Joneses in the world than  Stallmans or Torvalds. An easy solution is to shard based on two fi elds — for example, fi rst name  and surname. This usually results in a much better distribution of data.  Another consideration is how and where data will be written. Imagine a logging collection. It may  seem logical to shard by a timestamp, particularly if you often run queries on this fi eld  for example,   c10.indd   343 c10.indd   343  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   344  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  generating reports for particular time periods . But this inevitably causes all writes to go to a single  shard  containing the chunk covering the current time range . Shards containing older time ranges  will not receive any writes.   This is fi ne if you shard because a single server doesn’t have enough disk space, or because you want  a subset of the data to be held in memory for performance. But if your aim is to distribute reads  and writes, this method fails. The same is true for any ascending key, such as an auto-incrementing  counter, where you are always writing to the “end” of the range. Writes end up being concentrated  on a single server, resulting in a hotspot.  When choosing a sharding key, you should also give some thought as to how you will be querying  the data. If you shard on an e-mail address fi eld, it makes it easy to subsequently pull up the record  for a particular user. Mongo knows on which shard this will exist and can send the query to the  appropriate server. By contrast, if you then attempt to pull up a list of all users with a particular  surname, Mongo would have no choice other than to query each server. Fortunately, this is done in  parallel, which eliminates a lot of the performance penalty. But it still results in an increase in  network traffi c and makes your query as slow as the slowest node.   In many ways, choosing the sharding key is the most diffi cult part of setting up sharding, and  careful thought should be given to the key. It can make a signifi cant difference in how scalable  the application will be, and the wrong key can cause serious headaches further down the line. The  choice of key is application-specifi c, but indexed fi elds are usually the fi rst candidates to consider.   mongos and Conﬁ guration Servers  In a MySQL sharding setup, you must add an extra step of logic to your application code. First,  you must keep track of which shards reside on which servers.  You can either hard-code this lookup  table in your application’s confi guration fi le or store it in, say, memcache.  Every time your applica- tion performs a query, it must consult this table to determine to which servers to send the query. If  you want to query servers in parallel, you often must jump through additional hoops.  In Mongo, all this is taken care of automatically through the use of two additional services: mongos  and confi guration servers. When the application code issues a query, it sends it to mongos, which  then decides which shard nodes to forward the query on to. mongos then returns the result to the  application.   If multiple servers must be queried, mongos sends the queries in parallel, collates the results, and  then returns them to the application. In this way the application is unaware that sharding is even  happening, and thinks it is simply communicating with a single Mongo server. These mongos servers  are light enough that they can be run on existing servers. One option is to run a mongos process on  each shard server, but you could equally well run then on top of each application server. The latter  should result in slightly lower latency.  mongos processes know where to route queries because they pull their logic from the second new  addition to the infrastructure — confi guration servers. These are similarly lightweight services that  contain information on the sharding layout — specifi cally, which chunks reside on which servers.   For example, all users with e-mail addresses beginning a–h reside in chunk W, which is stored on  server X. All users with addresses beginning i–p live in chunk Y on server Z. When a mongos pro- cess starts, it pulls this information from the confi guration server, and if the mapping subsequently   c10.indd   344 c10.indd   344  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   MongoDB  ❘  345  changes  for example, Mongo rebalances a chunk to another node , the confi guration server pushes  the change to each mongos process.   The confi guration servers are kept in sync with each other using replication, but they automatically  use their own internal implementation, and you should defi nitely not set them up as a replica set.  Figure 10-4 shows a minimum setup for sharding. One or more application servers send requests to  one or more mongos servers, which, in turn, route the requests on to the appropriate Mongo node.  Three confi guration servers keep the mongos processes in sync with the location of the shards.  Conﬁguration Servers  mongos  Application Servers  FIGURE 10-4  Mongo Nodes  As already mentioned, though, the confi guration and mongos servers are light enough that you’d  probably just run them on top of the application servers — one of each on each application server.

Let’s assume an  empty collection because this is simpler than sharding an existing collection.  With each mongod server up and running in the usual manner, you can connect to one instance  and run the addShard command to add the hostname of each shard.  It’s preferable to use host- names rather than IP addresses in case you ever move your mongod daemons to different machines.   Following is an example:  > db.runCommand  { addshard : "shard1.example.com" }  ; > db.runCommand  { addshard : "shard2.example.com" }  ; > db.runCommand  { addshard : "shard3.example.com" }  ;  You can confi rm that the shards have been added by using listshards, as shown here:  > db.runCommand  { listshards : 1 }  ;  Next, you must enable sharding for the relevant database and collection, and, in the latter case, also  specifying the shard key, as shown here:  > db.runCommand  { enablesharding : "foo" }  ; > db.runCommand  { shardcollection : "foo.users", key : {username : 1} }    At this point, mongod operates in a sharded setup, but you still must set up mongos and confi gura- tion servers so that clients can access the correct shard.  To start a confi guration server, launch mongod with the –configsvr option, as shown here:  mongod –configsvr  The MongoDB developers recommend using three confi guration servers in a live environment.  For mongos servers, pass the --configdb command-line option, followed by a comma-separated list  of confi guration servers, as shown here:  mongos --configdb config1.example.com,config2.example.com,config3.example.com  At this point, the sharding setup should be fully operational, and clients can be confi gured to send  their queries to any of the running mongos daemons.  Chunks and Balancing  You check the status of the sharding setup like so:  > db.printShardingStatus  ; --- Sharding Status ---             sharding version: { "_id" : 1, "version" : 3 }   shards:                                                {  "_id" : "shard0000",  "host" : "s1.example.com:10000" }         {  "_id" : "shard0001",  "host" : "s2.example.com:10000" }   databases:                                                          {  "_id" : "admin",  "partitioned" : false,  "primary" : "config" }  c10.indd   346 c10.indd   346  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   MongoDB  ❘  347          {  "_id" : "foo",  "partitioned" : true,  "primary" : "shard0000" }                 foo.users chunks:                                                                           shard0000       1                                                   { "name" : { $minKey : 1 } } -->> { "name" :                               { $maxKey : 1 } } on : shard0000 { "t" : 1000,                               "i" : 0 }  From the output, you can see that there are two sharding servers  s1.example.com and s2.example .com . Of the two databases that exist, admin is not sharded  "partitioned" : false , whereas foo is.   The remainder of the output shows how the chunks have been allocated. At the moment, there’s  only one chunk  the collection has little data in it , and it resides on shard0000. The fi nal line shows  the key range contained in this chunk. As you might expect, it contains the full range  minKey to  maxKey . In case you’re wondering, the t and i fi elds are internal versioning fi elds — t is incre- mented when a chunk is moved to another shard  this causes i to be reset also , and i is incremented  when a chunk is split.  If you continue adding data to the collection, multiple chunks will eventually be created — by  default, Mongo keeps chunks at approximately 64 MB.     foo.users chunks:                                                               shard0000       6                                               { "name" : { $minKey : 1 } } -->> { "name" : "02e74f10" } on : shard0000 {         "t" : 1000, "i" : 1 }   { "name" : "02e74f11" } -->> { "name" : "35f4a8d4" } on : shard0000 {         "t" : 1000, "i" : 9 }   { "name" : "35f4a8d5" } -->> { "name" : "812b4ba2" } on : shard0000 {         "t" : 1000, "i" : 10 }   { "name" : "812b4ba3" } -->> { "name" : "c4ca4238" } on : shard0000 {         "t" : 1000, "i" : 7 }    { "name" : "c4ca4239" } -->> { "name" : "fe9fc289" } on : shard0000 {         "t" : 1000, "i" : 8 }    { "name" : "fe9fc290" } -->> { "name" : { $maxKey : 1 } } on : shard0000 {         "t" : 1000, "i" : 4 }             At this point, you now have six chunks, but they still all reside on the same shard server. In fact,  Mongo won’t start rebalancing until one server has eight more chunks than the other. At that point,  it moves chunks around until the difference between servers is down to two chunks. Let’s add some  more data:   shard0000       9                            { "name" : { $minKey : 1 } } -->> { "name" : "02e74f10" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 1 }  { "name" : "02e74f11" } -->> { "name" : "35f4a8d4" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 9 }  { "name" : "35f4a8d5" } -->> { "name" : "642e92ef" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 15 }  { "name" : "642e92f0" } -->> { "name" : "812b4ba2" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 16 }  { "name" : "812b4ba3" } -->> { "name" : "9bf31c7f" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 13 }  { "name" : "9bf31c80" } -->> { "name" : "c4ca4238" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 14 }  { "name" : "c4ca4239" } -->> { "name" : "d9d4f495" } on : shard0000 {   c10.indd   347 c10.indd   347  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   348  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS        "t" : 1000, "i" : 11 }  { "name" : "d9d4f496" } -->> { "name" : "fe9fc289" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 12 }  { "name" : "fe9fc290" } -->> { "name" : { $maxKey : 1 } } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 4 }          Mongo now begins rebalancing, and if you check back a few moments later, you can see that the  fi rst chunk has already been moved. Notice that t has been incremented to refl ect this.   shard0001       1                            shard0000       8                            { "name" : { $minKey : 1 } } -->> { "name" : "02e74f10" } on : shard0001 {        "t" : 2000, "i" : 0 }  { "name" : "02e74f10" } -->> { "name" : "35f4a8d4" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 2000, "i" : 1 }  { "name" : "35f4a8d4" } -->> { "name" : "642e92ef" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 15 }  { "name" : "642e92ef" } -->> { "name" : "812b4ba2" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 16 }  { "name" : "812b4ba2" } -->> { "name" : "9bf31c7f" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 13 }  { "name" : "9bf31c7f" } -->> { "name" : "c4ca4238" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 14 }  { "name" : "c4ca4238" } -->> { "name" : "d9d4f495" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 11 }  { "name" : "d9d4f495" } -->> { "name" : "fe9fc289" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 1 }  Rebalancing isn’t an instantaneous process because the 64-MB chunks must be copied across  servers. But eventually you reach a situation in which four chunks have been copied over to  shard0001, leaving fi ve on shard0000  again, notice how t and i have changed :   shard0001       4                            shard0000       5                            { "name" : { $minKey : 1 } } -->> { "name" : "02e74f10" } on : shard0001 {        "t" : 2000, "i" : 0 }  { "name" : "02e74f10" } -->> { "name" : "35f4a8d4" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 2000, "i" : 0 }  { "name" : "35f4a8d4" } -->> { "name" : "642e92ef" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 2000, "i" : 0 }  { "name" : "642e92ef" } -->> { "name" : "812b4ba2" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 2000, "i" : 0 }  { "name" : "812b4ba2" } -->> { "name" : "9bf31c7f" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 13 }  { "name" : "9bf31c7f" } -->> { "name" : "c4ca4238" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 14 }  { "name" : "c4ca4238" } -->> { "name" : "d9d4f495" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 11 }  { "name" : "d9d4f495" } -->> { "name" : "fe9fc289" } on : shard0000 {        "t" : 1000, "i" : 1 }  Why 64-MB chunks? This number wasn’t chosen at random and has been the source of much  debate among Mongo developers.  In fact, earlier versions of Mongo used a much higher chunk  size.  On the one hand, you want chunks to be small enough that they can be moved from shard to   c10.indd   348 c10.indd   348  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   MongoDB  ❘  349  shard relatively easily without putting too much strain on bandwidth or disk I O. However, moving  chunks also means more work for Mongo — the lookup table held on the confi guration servers must  be updated and the changes pushed to each mongos server. So, you also want chunks to be large  enough that they aren’t moved around too often.   If wanted, you can change the chunk size like so:  > use config > db.settings.save {_id:"chunksize", value:128} ;     128MB  You’d probably want to experiment with this only if huge amounts of data were added, resulting in  the default 64-MB chunks being split moved too often.  If the rebalancing of chunks causes too much of a strain on individual nodes or the network, you can  schedule rebalancing only between certain hours — in the following example, between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.:  > use config; > db.settings.update { _id : "balancer" }, { $set : { activeWindow :       { start : "2:00", stop : "6:00" } } }, true  ;  This is handy for stopping rebalancing from potentially impacting traffi c during busy times. But you  must ensure that the amount of data added is suffi ciently low so that the rebalancing can complete  within these times. In practice, this is usually only a concern if bandwidth is limited, the time  window is too small, or huge amounts of data are written each day.  Replicating Shards  Replication offers you security against nodes failing  and some degree of read scaling , whereas shard- ing provides write scaling but no redundancy. It seems natural to combine the two together, and, in fact,  this is one of the most popular ways for setting up a Mongo cluster. Figure 10-6 shows the topology.  Conﬁguration Servers  Application Servers  + mongos + conf  FIGURE 10-6  Mongo Nodes  c10.indd   349 c10.indd   349  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   350  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  Although this initially looks quite intimidating, it is nothing more than a combination of the two  scaling techniques previously described. As before, the application servers connect to mongos  processes, which route queries to the appropriate shard. This time, though, each shard is actually a  replica set triplet. Again, these replica sets are no different from the examples presented earlier. You  can have as many nodes in the set as necessary  although the recommended minimum is three , and  you can still direct queries to either a master or a slave to help balance read queries — mongos takes  care of ensuring the queries go to the correct shard replica set.  The only difference in the sharding setup with this model is that you can tell Mongo that each shard  is a replica set. If the set were named foo, the syntax would now be as follows:  > db.runCommand  { addshard : "foo shard3.example.com" }  ;  This enables the usual auto-discovery and query balancing to take place.  GridFS  Let’s move away from sharding and replication, and talk about another feature of Mongo: the  Grid Filesystem  GridFS . Storing user-uploaded content  such as avatars  is a common problem on  multiserver setups. You can use a network-aware fi lesystem such as Network File System  NFS  to  allow all web servers to access a common area to write uploads to, but NFS is slow. You could use  a cron job to periodically rsync fi les to across to a common area, but this would introduce a delay  between the fi le being uploaded and it being available globally  and could also cause spikes in CPU  and bandwidth .  One thing developers are taught to defi nitely not do is store fi les in MySQL  for example in a blob  column . MySQL is so often the bottleneck in a system that adding extra load to it like this is sui- cide. It’s not what MySQL is designed for either, so access times can be relatively poor, and it can  poison your carefully confi gured caches and buffers. This also greatly increases the size of your  tables, making dumping and restoring much slower.  It’s perhaps surprising, then, that Mongo actually encourages you to store fi les in it, and even pro- vides a way to do this via the GridFS. The observations about dumping and restoring slower still  stand, but storing fi les in this way has a number of benefi ts:   ➤ You no longer need to worry about using a shared network fi lesystem or syncing fi les across   multiple servers.   ➤ If you use replication, you have a backup copy of the fi les on another server.   ➤ You can store meta data  such as an MD5 checksum, date, username, and so on  alongside   each fi le and search on these fi elds.  GridFS uses its own database, named fs, with two collections: chunks for chunks of the fi le, and  files for meta data associated with each fi le. Files are stored pretty much as regular documents  would be. But because there is a limit of 16 MB on the size of an individual document, in many  cases, Mongo would need to split the fi le into chunks spanning multiple documents. This is actually  advantageous. It means that the fi le is streamed back to the client in chunks, rather than Mongo  attempting to buffer the whole fi le in memory. It also allows you to jump to the midsections of fi les.   c10.indd   350 c10.indd   350  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   MongoDB  ❘  351  So useful is this that, for GridFS, the chunk size actually defaults to 256 KB, signifi cantly less than  the 16 MB maximum.  The files collection contains  at a minimum  the following fi elds:   ➤ _id — This unique ID for the fi le will be auto-generated if omitted.   ➤ Length — This is the size of the fi le  in bytes .   ➤ chunkSize — This is how big each chunk should be.   ➤ uploadDate — This is the date time when the fi le was inserted into the database.   ➤ md5 — This is an MD5 checksum of the fi le.  Additional fi elds may be added if necessary. For example, it’s quite common to include the fi le’s  MIME type, a username, and perhaps a title or description.  The chunks collection consists of a unique ID fi eld, a fi eld containing the corresponding ID of the  fi le in the files collection, the chunk number, and the data. Chunk number is an incrementing  value that ensures the chunks of the fi le are returned in the correct order.  Although you could theoretically handle fi les as if they were any other kind of data — splitting them  into chunks and inserted into the collection — Mongo provides the command-line tool mongofiles  to take care of these fi ner points for you.  First, you write a fi le to GridFS, as shown here:  $ mongofiles put twitter.png connected to: 127.0.0.1 added file: { _id: ObjectId '4f495177bdc23c5be1912771' , filename: "twitter.png",   chunkSize: 262144, uploadDate: new Date 1330229047751 , md5:    "6ad40e7be284e362fa479eb522241306", length: 3319 } done!  Next, you get a list of existing fi les:  $ mongofiles list connected to: 127.0.0.1 twitter.png     3319  $ mongofiles get twitter.png connected to: 127.0.0.1 done write to: twitter.png  When you’re ready, you can fetch the fi le back, as shown here:  Most Mongo drivers also provide methods for interacting with GridFS. For example, in PHP, the  following shows the most popular, MongoGridFS:  $r = new Mongo  ; $database = $r->foo; $grid = $database->getGridFS  ; print $grid->storeFile   c10.indd   351 c10.indd   351  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   352  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS          " tmp upload.gif",         array "metadata" => array               "filename" => "upload.gif",              "mimeType" => "image gif",              "uploadedBy" => "pgsmith"             ,          "filename" = > "upload.gif"        ;  More often than not, you already have the fi le contents stored in a string and may want to write this  to GridFS. In this case, you use storeBytes rather than storeFile and pass the string as the fi rst  parameter  rather than the fi lename .  GridFS and Nginx Although GridFS neatly solves the problems of allowing multiple web servers to access contents  from a common location, be cautious about viewing it as a new toy and using it for holding all  static contents. Although performance is good, it’s still generally better to host static resources  on a traditional fi lesystem.  There are a few situations in which GridFS wins over traditional  fi lesystems — for example, there are less restrictions on permitted characters in fi lenames, and  traditional fi lesystems often struggle when faced with millions of fi les in the same directory.   For user-uploaded content, GridFS is great, but having to execute some code to retrieve an image  each time is far from ideal. For example, if your users’ avatars were stored in GridFS, you might use  mark-up like this:     You’d then use a mod_rewrite rule to catch any requests for resources under  avatars  and  redirect them to a server-side script. This script would pull the appropriate image from GridFS  and then echo out the content type and the data.   To the client, it would look like a standard request response for an image. But behind the scenes, the  web server would need to do signifi cantly more work than for a static resource.  The good news is that there exists for Nginx a module that enables it to talk directly to Mongo and  pull fi les from GridFS. This eliminates the overhead involved in executing a scripting language and  gives performance closer to the serving of static fi les. The module is aptly named nginx-gridfs and  is available from https:  github.com mdirolf nginx-gridfs.  NOTE  Chapter 7, “Working with Web Servers,” provides a more complete dis- cussion of Nginx.  GridFS-fuse For those not using Nginx, a fi nal method to access GridFS is via the FUSE kernel module, enabling  it to be mounted just like a regular fi lesystem. A GridFS wrapper for FUSE is available from  https:  github.com mikejs gridfs-fuse.  c10.indd   352 c10.indd   352  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   Other NoSQL Technologies  ❘  353  Mongo versus MySQL  It’s easy to see why some commentators have suggested that Mongo should be the new “M” in  LAMP  which currently stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP . In so many ways Mongo seems  to outperform MySQL — whether it be its superior replication and sharding, or its blistering  performance — that you might question whether MySQL still has a place in modern web applications.  One of the biggest shortcomings of Mongo at the moment is its reliance on global locking, which  can dramatically slow down both reads and writes on write-heavy setups. This level of locking  makes even MyISAM’s table-level locking seem unobtrusive in comparison. Work is currently  underway to implement more granular locking in MongoDB — probably at the collection  level — so, hopefully, this will not be an issue for too much longer. In the meantime, both sharding  and replication can help alleviate this problem.  Some Mongo advocates also fail to appreciate Mongo’s approach to durability. They perform some  crude benchmarking that shows how Mongo can make several orders of magnitude more writes  per second than MySQL, without realizing that these writes have not necessarily been committed  to disk. To achieve a similar level of data security to MySQL, you must enable both journaling and  periodic use of fsync, which both impact performance.  Remember that you don’t get any feedback  on whether the write was successful, unless you specifi cally ask for it — which, again, impacts  performance.  In practice, Mongo still outperforms MySQL, but the gap is now no longer as huge.  That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with Mongo’s approach to data durability, providing that  you understand the potentially volatile nature of the data. The biggest problem is not Mongo’s  behavior, but the users’ failure to understand it. Most people are happy with the idea that memcache  offers volatile storage, but many simply assume that writes in Mongo will be safe — and without a  couple of tweaks, they are not. Even then, if the slight chance of data loss can’t be tolerated at all   for example, for fi nancial transactions , Mongo is probably not the best choice.  This raises the next drawback: lack of transactions. Again, in many situations, this is acceptable,  and Mongo’s model is no worse than, say, MyISAM. But if you deal with money, Mongo isn’t the right  tool for the job, and you’re much better off sticking with InnoDB.  With the exception of global locking  which seems like an issue that should have been addressed  much earlier , these points aren’t a criticism of MongoDB. It does what it claims to do well and has  never been pitched as a complete replacement for MySQL. Consider Mongo as an extra tool in your  arsenal, and use it when it makes sense to use it — not because of any NoSQL hype.   The number of new technologies falling under the NoSQL banner is huge. So far, you’ve seen two  of the most important ones. But, in the following section, you learn about some of the many other  options.  OTHER NOSQL TECHNOLOGIES  MongoDB and memcache are both at opposite ends of the spectrum, and there are a great number  of NoSQL offerings that fall somewhere in the middle. Mongo and memcache are two favorites.   And space does not permit doing justice to all of the others.  But NoSQL is an exciting area, and  there are many other technologies that are gaining strong user bases. To round out this discussion of  NoSQL, let’s look at some of these offerings, and examine the relative pros and cons of each.  c10.indd   353 c10.indd   353  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   354  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  Tokyo Cabinet and Tokyo Tyrant  Sponsored by the Japanese social networking site mixi, inc., Tokyo Cabinet is a multithreaded  database library  like SQLite  that is both fast and fl exible. Tokyo Tyrant is the name given to the  accompanying network server that handles client connections and concurrency. Tokyo Tyrant has a  reputation for being fast and offers high levels of concurrency via an event-polling model  epoll .   Tokyo Cabinet offers a choice of underlying storage engines, of which the following are the four  most common:   ➤ Hash table — This stores key-value pairs in a traditional hash structure.   ➤ B-tree — Although this also uses key-value pairs, it allows them to be stored in a   user-defi ned order, making it possible to perform range and prefi x matching.   ➤ Fixed length — This simple array structure is used rather than a hash. Data is accessed by  specifying a numeric array key offset. This makes it a truly fast engine; although, it can be  somewhat impractical to work with.   ➤ Table — This behaves like a traditional RDBMS engine with rows and columns. It supports   indexing and sorting but is also schema-less  like MongoDB . Locking occurs at the row  level.  Tokyo Cabinet has some support for transactions, and ACID compliance with write-ahead  logging is available. It also supports replication; although, no built-in sharding support is available.   However, there’s nothing to stop you from rolling your own sharding solution.   Although Tokyo Cabinet is an excellent persistent key-value store, it is not primarily a document  database like Mongo, and this is the weakest part of it. For modeling and querying more complex  data types, the likes of Mongo or MySQL are still better solutions.  As a key-value store, however, Tokyo Cabinet has numerous benefi ts over memcache and membase.  It uses a binary protocol for storage  generally more effi cient than text-based , supports the  compression of data  either via gzip, bzip2, or a custom implementation , and has support for  Lua scripting, making it extensible.  Finally, Tokyo Cabinet also ships with its own full-text search system, Tokyo Distopia. although  Tokyo Cabinet is not as well known as memcache, it surpasses it in many ways.  CouchDB  CouchDB is another JSON-based document database, similar to Mongo. The most obvious  difference on the surface is that CouchDB uses a HTTP REST interface for querying it, and this will  always be several times slower than a binary over TCP IP protocol. In the past, the data querying  method has also been rather different, revolving around MapReduce and views. In 2011, CouchDB  introduced UnQL as a general-purpose NoSQL querying language, providing a more traditional feel  to query execution.   CouchDB’s attitude to scale is also markedly different, with replication being used as a  scaling  tool.  In MySQL, replication is seen as a partial solution to scaling, whereas Mongo prefers   c10.indd   354 c10.indd   354  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   Other NoSQL Technologies  ❘  355  sharding for scaling and replication for durability.  CouchDB uses master-master replication,  and this introduces performance considerations because care must be taken to ensure that data  remains in sync. A multiversion concurrency control  MVCC  model is used, which solves many  of these problems — and also allows for high levels of simultaneous reads and writes. But this  comes at the cost of performance. So, although CouchDB is well suited to write-heavy applica- tions or those that demand data integrity, it doesn’t offer the blistering speed seen in its main  rival, Mongo.  Project Voldemort  Voldemort is a persistent key-value store developed and used by LinkedIn. It features automatic  replication and partitioning  sharding , making it capable of scaling horizontally for both reads and  writes.  Voldemort is perhaps most like membase in that it combines the in-memory caching of memcache  with the persistent storage offered by membase. It should be remembered that Voldemort isn’t  intended as a cache, though, and lacks features such as automatic expiration of keys or an LRU  retention policy.  If a volatile cache is all that is needed, memcache is a better choice.  Rather,  Voldemort is a complete storage solution that supports complex objects as keys or values, and  versioning of data.  Amazon Dynamo and Google BigTable  Two import products in the NoSQL world are actually proprietary systems developed with only  limited availability to the public.   Dynamo is a distributed key-value store, developed by Amazon.com and used by parts of Amazon  Web Services  AWS . It is not available to the general public but forms a key part of Amazon’s  infrastructure. It uses sharding and replication, and puts an emphasis on fault tolerance.  Google’s BigTable is a three-dimensional store, with values referenced by a row key, column key,  and timestamp triplet — the latter allows for versioning and automatic expiration of data. It runs  on top of Google File System  GFS  and uses compression in some situations. It is designed to hold  millions of gigabytes of data across thousands of nodes and is a core part of many of Google’s  services.  Google offers some access to BigTable via its App Engine, and Amazon.com offers DynamoDB   a NoSQL database built on Dynamo  as part of AWS. Other than that, neither of these technologies  is available to the public. So, why are they so important in the NoSQL world?  Both are relatively old for NoSQL — BigTable began life in 2004, and Dynamo in 2007 — and  both were developed by large companies  that could provide plenty of funding  with high- performance demands. Although neither product is open source, Amazon.com and Google  have published plenty of papers on their inner workings, and this has inspired many others to  create open source NoSQL applications using similar concepts. As a result, many of the  popular open source NoSQL solutions on the market today have their roots indirectly in these  two offerings.  c10.indd   355 c10.indd   355  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   356  ❘  CHAPTER 10  UTILIZING NOSQL SOLUTIONS  Riak has been designed heavily around Dynamo. Its main selling point is fault tolerance, and it can  withstand many nodes going down without any data becoming unavailable. As part of its emphasis  on reliability, it has no concept of master and secondary nodes  thus, no single points of failure   and uses consistent hashing to partition data. As with most multidimensional stores, Riak is geared  toward storing huge volumes of data.   Developed by Facebook, Cassandra is a multidimensional key-value store inspired by both BigTable  and Dynamo and written in Java. It has the unusual characteristic that writes are much faster than  reads, making it well suited to write-heavy applications.  As with Riak, Cassandra uses a decentralized network model, with all nodes being equal   no masters and slaves , and data replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance. It also  supports partitioning and offers two alternative models for distributing the data.  Another key-value store, Redis, is written in C and sponsored by VMWare. It uses a strategy similar to  Mongo for durability and can operate entirely out of memory if performance is more important  than data integrity. Alternatively, Redis also supports periodic snapshotting  basically the equivalent  to using fsync in Mongo  and journaling. The primary selling point of Redis is its speed; although, to  achieve such fast read writes, the working set should be small enough to fi t into memory.  HBase is another BigTable-inspired database, supporting huge volumes of data, and with a particu- lar emphasis on good performance for random read. It offers row-level locking, strong consistency   HBase’s obvious main rival, Cassandra, uses eventual consistency , fault tolerance, data locality,  and native MapReduce support. HBase’s approach to scaling out is something of a hybrid method.  Although it uses the concept of masters and slaves, it does not depend on masters heavily and can  survive even if the master goes down.  Riak  Cassandra  Redis  HBase  SUMMARY  The days when data storage was a choice between fl at text fi les or a bulky RDBMS are long gone,  and there is now a wealth of alternative solutions. Although typically grouped together under the  name of NoSQL, there is a huge variety in how they work. But one common theme is that they were  all designed for scalability in today’s modern web world.  memcache is one of the most popular NoSQL technologies. It offers a basic key-value store and  is perfect for situations in which an RDBMS like MySQL would be overkill. memcache is well  supported by scripting languages, such as PHP, Python, and Ruby, and can be scaled across  multiple nodes.  c10.indd   356 c10.indd   356  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   Summary  ❘  357  It should be remembered that data in memcache is volatile and is not stored in persistent storage   such as a hard disk . membase — an off-shoot of memcache — solves this, and introduces a more  intelligent way to scale across many nodes.  At the other end of the NoSQL spectrum is Mongo, a document store that offers many of the  features seen in traditional databases. Modeling data structures in real-world applications can be  tricky in MySQL, and Mongo excels in situations in which the structure of your data is dynamic.  It also offers good support for sharding and replication, which are essential when you appreciate  Mongo’s single-server durability model.  A lot of hype has surrounded NoSQL, with much of the hype claiming it marks the death of the  traditional RDBMS. Although it’s true that NoSQL has taken over from the likes of MySQL in  many environments, MySQL still has its place, and NoSQL should be viewed as another weapon in  your arsenal, rather than as a MySQL replacement.   Having spent the past three chapters looking at databases in various shapes and forms, it’s time  to look at other aspects of back-end performance. Many sites use Secure Sockets Layer  SSL , often  without realizing the hit this can have on performance. In Chapter 11, you discover the reasons that  SSL can be costly, and what you can do to minimize that cost.  c10.indd   357 c10.indd   357  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   c10.indd   358 c10.indd   358  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   11  Working with Secure Sockets  Layer  SSL   WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Caching SSL sessions with session IDs or session tickets   ➤ Setting up an SSL endpoint in HAProxy, Nginx, or Apache   ➤ Understanding the performance impacts of key and certiﬁ cate sizes,   as well as cipher suites   ➤ Looking toward the future  Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  is the encryption method used to securely transmit data over  HTTP, where it is often referred to as HTTPS. Widely used for e-commerce and webmail, the  extra overhead involved in setting up the secure channel and encrypting decrypting data can  have an impact on performance — both on server load and responsiveness. In this chapter, you  learn how to combat this through a variety of techniques.  The discussion here clarifi es the distinction between SSL and Transport Layer Security  TLS ,  and helps you gauge how big of a performance penalty SSL incurs. You also learn about  performance-related aspects of SSL, such as key size and intermediate certifi cates, as well  as about enhancements such as session reuse, session tickets, and how these can work in  multiserver environments.  NOTE  The terms “SSL” and “TLS” are often used interchangeably, but they are  not quite the same thing. The fi rst public release of SSL was version 2.0 in 1995  and, in light of numerous security concerns, this was quickly followed by version  3.0 in 1996. TLS didn’t appear until 1999 and was designed as a replacement for  SSL. Since then, there have been two revisions to TLS: version 1.1 in 2006 and  version 1.2 in 2008. So, although SSL has essentially been replaced by TLS, the  discussion in this chapter uses the term “SSL” to mean “SSL TLS.”  c11.indd   359 c11.indd   359  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   360  ❘  CHAPTER 11  WORKING WITH SECURE SOCKETS LAYER  SSL   SSL CACHING  The principle advantage of using SSL is session caching, which can signifi cantly reduce CPU usage  and lower latency during HTTP requests. But to thoroughly understand session caching, it’s  important to fi rst take a closer look at the SSL protocol.  Connections, Sessions, and Handshakes  Before HTTP requests can be sent over SSL, a  secure channel must fi rst be established. This  involves the server sending the certifi cate  and the  browser validating it  an encryption protocol being  agreed on and keys being exchanged. Figure 11-1  shows an overview of the process.  Actually, there’s more going on here:    1.  The initial hello from the client includes a  random number, as well as a list of encryp- tion methods and SSL TLS versions that  the client supports.     2.  The response from the server specifi es the   encryption method and SSL TLS  version that are to be used  the server  having selected from the lists offered in  the fi rst step , as well as the certifi cate.    3.  The client verifi es the signature on the   certifi cate supplied by the server. It then  encrypts the random number with the  server’s public key and sends this to  the server. Optionally, the client may  also include a copy of its own certifi cate,  if client authentication is being used.   1   2   3   4   Hello  Certiﬁcate  Key exchange  Ok, ﬁnished    4.  The server sends back a “fi nish” message    encrypted with the secret key . The client can now issue HTTP requests.  FIGURE 11-1  There’s a lot of CPU processing involved here, and the fact that two round trips are needed pushes  up latency — for communications across continents, where latency can be more than 100 millisec- onds, you spend almost one-half a second simply on the SSL handshake.  Abbreviated Handshakes  To improve this situation, HTTPS allows an abbreviated handshake to be used in certain  situations. This eliminates two of the messages  which happen to be the most CPU-intensive two ,  resulting in a two-step handshake. Figure 11-2 shows the abbreviated form.  c11.indd   360 c11.indd   360  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   SSL Caching  ❘  361  To use abbreviated handshakes, one of two compet- ing extensions must be used: session identifi ers or  session tickets.   Hello  Session Identiﬁ ers  Session identifi ers  session IDs  have been around  since the inception of TLS and are the extension  most widely supported by browsers. Under this  scheme, the web server may optionally include a  session ID in its response to the client’s hello during  step 2 of a full handshake. This ID corresponds to  cached session data held locally by the server.  The client caches this session ID and sends it in its  initial hello at the beginning of the subsequent  handshakes. If the server fi nds corresponding session data in its cache for this ID, it proceeds with  the abbreviated handshake; otherwise, a full handshake is used.  Set cipher, ﬁnish  FIGURE 11-2  In addition to cutting down the number of steps in the handshake, session caching also reduces the  size of each step. For example, the server no longer needs to send a copy of its certifi cate because  the client has already accepted it previously. Likewise, the computationally expensive steps of  verifying the certifi cate and encrypting the random number using the server’s key are avoided.  Session Caching in Nginx In Nginx, the settings include options to set the caching type and session lifetime.  ssl_session_cache off  none  builtin  shared:name:size  builtin uses the cache built into OpenSSL, but this means that it isn’t shared across worker  processes. It is better to use Nginx’s cache  shared , which is shared across workers. In this case,  you must also give the cache a name and a size. The Nginx documentation suggests a 1 MB cache  can hold approximately 4,000 sessions. Following is an example set for 5 MB:  ssl_session_cache shared:mycache:5M  The lifetime for session data in the cache is controlled by ssl_session_timeout, as shown here   for 1 hour :  ssl_session_timeout 1h  With both of these options, it is strongly recommended that you place them in the http block of the  Nginx confi guration fi le; although, they can also be used in server blocks.   Session Caching in Apache When you use Apache’s mod_ssl, SSL session caching is disabled by default — which is  regrettable because many administrators aren’t aware of its existence in order to enable it. The   SSLSessionCache directive is used to control caching and supports three principle methods: none,   c11.indd   361 c11.indd   361  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   362  ❘  CHAPTER 11  WORKING WITH SECURE SOCKETS LAYER  SSL   disk-based  via a DBM hash fi le , or in-memory. Naturally the latter is the preferred option because  it is implemented in shared memory. This makes the cache accessible globally, rather than being  confi ned to a particular Apache pre-fork process.   For shared memory caching, the syntax is as follows:  SSLSessionCache shm: etc apache ssl_cache 1024000   The fi gure in parentheses is the wanted size of the cache  in bytes .  The lifetime for entries in the cache may also be set. The TLS specifi cations  RFC 5246  suggest  caching for no longer than 24 hours, but values this high may be pointless anyway because most  clients won’t cache the session ID at their end for this long.  For example, the caching times for  Microsoft Windows have varied considerably. Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 cached for 2 minutes,  whereas Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 and Windows XP cached for 10 hours.  As shown in the  following example, 1 hour  3,600 seconds  is a reasonable option but will naturally require a larger  cache size than if you go for a lifetime of a few minutes.  SSLSessionCacheTimeout 3600   Session Caching in stunnel stunnel has built-in support for session caching, and it is enabled by default with a session lifetime  of 5 minutes. You can override this in the confi guration fi le like so:  session = 1800  sets a session life of 30 minutes  1800 seconds   The latest versions of stunnel also ships with support for a new feature, sessiond, a shared session  cache. The IP:port of the sessiond server can now be specifi ed in the stunnel confi guration, as  shown here:  sessiond = 192.168.10.50:54321  This is a big advance for stunnel and helps it to keep up with the shared session caching offered by  Apache and Nginx.  Session Caching in stud stud also offers session caching; although, the option is disabled by default. Use the -C    command-line switch to enable the cache and set its size. The cache is shared across all stud worker  processes.  Session Tickets  Session identifi ers have two fundamental weaknesses because of their reliance on server-side  caching:    ➤ Caches take up valuable memory, and you can rarely afford to cache sessions for long   periods of time.  Instead, you must make a trade-off and lower the session lifetime to keep  the cache size down.    c11.indd   362 c11.indd   362  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   SSL Caching  ❘  363   ➤ Caching is always problematic in a load-balanced setup. For SSL session caching, if you  don’t use an SSL terminator, each back-end web server maintains its own private session  cache. The only way to guarantee that a client will hit the same back-end server each time   and, hence, do an abbreviated handshake  would be to use a session affi nity balancing  technique.  Session tickets  which are an extension to TLS  solve these shortcomings by storing the session data  on the client side. There’s now no need for a server-side cache because the client caches instead.   In the fi rst step of the SSL handshake  refer to Figure 11-1 , the client advertises its support for  session tickets, and in the second step, the server acknowledges support  assuming both client  and server support session tickets, of course . In the fi nal step of the full handshake, the server  issues a session ticket to the client containing encrypted session information — essentially the same  information that is stored server-side with session identifi ers. The client stores this ticket locally and  presents it to the server during subsequent SSL handshakes. If the server is happy with the integrity  of the ticket, the abbreviated handshake is used.  NOTE  Session tickets are still server-specifi c. A back-end web server will not  accept a ticket previously issued by another back-end server in the pool. So, you  still need to stick clients to the same back-end server.  Unfortunately, support for session tickets  both in browsers and web servers  is still poor. So, at the  moment, they aren’t a viable solution for cutting SSL latency and CPU overheads.   Distributed Session Caching  What if you want to use SSL session caching  via session identifi ers , but don’t want the potential  bottleneck of an SSL terminator sitting in front of your load balancer? You can use source IP-based  load-balancing to ensure clients go to the same back-end server each time, but other balancing  techniques  such as cookie insertion  can’t be used because you’re working with encrypted HTTP  packets.   The ideal solution would be to use a global cache for the session data, and then, no matter which  back-end server the client hit, the session data will be available. In addition, you won’t be forced to  use source IP-based load-balancing. Happily, both Apache and Nginx support distributed shared  global  pick whichever name you like  session caching — that is, to some extent.  Nginx  Although Nginx doesn’t natively support distributed SSL session caches, a third-party patch is avail- able from https:  github.com mpalmer Nginx to provide shared caching via memcache. Unlike  modules, patches must be applied to the Nginx source code before compiling, and they are usually  version-specifi c. So, there’s no guarantee that this patch will work with the latest version of Nginx.  Also, calls to memcache are performed synchronously, which causes a signifi cant performance  penalty. There isn’t much that can be done about this  it’s a weakness in the design of OpenSSL , but  it’s certainly enough to question whether to implement distributed session caching in Nginx.  c11.indd   363 c11.indd   363  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   364  ❘  CHAPTER 11  WORKING WITH SECURE SOCKETS LAYER  SSL   Apache and mod_gnutls  Shared session caching has been added to mod_ssl, but, as of this writing, is currently only available  in the development branch. If you want to go down this route, you’ll either need to build mod_ssl  from source, or try an alpha release of Apache version 2.3.  However, the preferred route at the moment is to abandon mod_ssl in favor of mod_gnutls. This  alternative SSL module has a number of nice features, including Server Name Indication and session  tickets, and also supports distributed session caching via memcache. Because mod_gnutls will be  new to many administrators, let’s take a brief look at how to install and confi gure it under Linux.  The fi rst thing to be aware of is that mod_gnutls doesn’t use OpenSSL. It uses GnuTLS, so this  must be installed fi rst.  Look for libgnutls in your distribution’s packages.  After downloading the  latest mod_gnutls  from http:  www.outoforder.cc downloads mod_gnutls  , you should  compile it according to the installation fi le instructions. The resulting module can then be copied to  the Apache modules directory, as shown here:  cp src .libs libmod_gnutls.so  usr lib apache2 modules   Two key fi les have also been created, and these must be copied into Apache’s confi guration  directory, as shown here:  cp data dhfile  etc apache2 conf  cp data rsafile  etc apache2 conf   Finally, you confi gure mod_gnutls in Apache, as shown here:  LoadModule gnutls_module modules libmod_gnutls.so AddType application x-x509-ca-cert .crt AddType application x-pkcs7-crl    .crl GnuTLSEnable on GnuTLSCertificateFile  etc apache2 ssl mydomain.crt GnuTLSKeyFile  etc apache2 ssl mydomain.key  As you can see, confi guration of mod_gnutls is similar to mod_ssl, albeit with different directive  names. To enable session caching in memcache, you use the following:  GnuTLSCache memcache 192.168.5.1:11211 GnuTLSCacheTimeout 3600  SSL TERMINATION AND ENDPOINTS  In Chapter 7, “Working with Web Servers,” you learned about the use of Nginx and HAProxy as  HTTP-aware load balancers. As noted in that discussion, encryption gets in the way because it stops  your balancer from inspecting the content of packets, and then balancing based on that content. For  example, the load balancer can’t see any cookies used for session affi nity. You can accept this loss  of functionality and fall back on Layer 4  that is, the transport layer of the OSI reference model   balancing — and then store session data in something like memcache. Or you can make the  load balancer one endpoint of an SSL tunnel  the other end being the client, of course .  c11.indd   364 c11.indd   364  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   SSL Termination and Endpoints  ❘  365  Figure 11-3 illustrates the topology for a load balancer behind an SSL terminator. In this fi gure, the  SSL terminator is shown as a separate physical machine, but it’s perfectly feasible for it to run on  the same machine as the load balancer  resources permitting .  SSL  Terminator  HAProxy  Load Balancer  HTTPS  HTTP  Pool of Web Servers  Client  FIGURE 11-3  If you prefer to use HAProxy for load-balancing, you’ll soon discover that HAProxy doesn’t support  SSL termination, and — judging from its author’s comments — probably never will.   Willy Tarreau  the author of HAProxy  is very much of the opinion that SSL termination is suicide  from a scalability point of view. He certainly has a point. Although it’s easy to add cheap back-end  servers, a load balancer is an expensive bottleneck, and using it as an SSL endpoint could have a big  impact on load. On the other hand, Google’s real-life observations  http:  www.imperialviolet .org 2010 06 25 overclocking-ssl.html  suggest that SSL is no longer a performance killer.  Because HAProxy can’t do SSL termination, you must put something in front of it that can. Your  choices are web servers such as Nginx and Apache or tunnels proxies such as stunnel and stud.  Let’s take a closer look at these alternatives.  SSL Termination with Nginx  It may seem odd using Nginx as an SSL terminator alongside HAProxy when the former already  offers most of the features that you need. The main reasons for doing so are the more advanced  load-balancing techniques offered by HAProxy, along with the more sophisticated server health  checking. Still, if you need only moderately intelligent load-balancing, Nginx on its own is the  preferred solution because it means one less potential point of failure.   In Nginx, you can easily set up SSL termination as an SSL-aware proxy and instruct it to forward  the traffi c on the backend s  over HTTP  as opposed to HTTPS . Let’s take a look at an example  that shows how to enable SSL in Nginx.   The following confi guration snippet balances any traffi c that Nginx receives over three back-end  servers:  upstream apachepool  {   server 192.168.0.100 weight=5;   server 192.168.0.101 weight=10;  c11.indd   365 c11.indd   365  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   After Nginx has been compiled with SSL support, enabling SSL is as simple as turning it on and  setting the path to the certifi cate and key, as shown here:  366  ❘  CHAPTER 11  WORKING WITH SECURE SOCKETS LAYER  SSL     server 192.168.0.102 weight=10; }  server {   location   {     proxy_pass  http:  apachepool;   } }  upstream apachepool  {   server 192.168.0.100 weight=5;   server 192.168.0.101 weight=10;   server 192.168.0.102 weight=10; }  server {   listen 443;   listen 80;   ssl on;   ssl_certificate  etc nginx ssl mysite.crt   ssl_certificate_key  etc nginx ssl mysite.key    location   {     proxy_pass  http:  apachepool;   } }  The key here is the proxy_pass statement that tells Nginx to proxy to the back-end servers over  HTTP. To simply balance the SSL traffi c without terminating, you’d use https:  apachepool   and wouldn’t need the earlier SSL statements . For multiple SSL-enabled sites, you simply add  additional server blocks for each IP address.  SSL Termination with Apache  You can achieve SSL termination with Apache by using its reverse proxy feature. After mod_proxy  and mod_ssl are enabled, the confi guration is as follows:  SSLEngine On SSLCertificateFile  etc apache2 ssl server.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile  etc apache2 ssl server.key   SSLProxyEngine on RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^  .* $ http:  localhost:8080 $1 [P]  The [P] fl ag to the rewrite rule causes it to proxy to the given URL. In this case, HAProxy listens  on port 8080 of the same machine, but, if necessary, the Apache SSL terminator could be on its own  box in front of HAProxy.  c11.indd   366 c11.indd   366  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   SSL Termination and Endpoints  ❘  367  Despite that Apache offers relatively poor performance, it also offers plenty of scope for SSL  performance tuning — in particular, caching.  SSL Termination with stunnel  Whereas Nginx and Apache are full-featured web servers that can be used to provide SSL  termination, stunnel is specifi cally an SSL tunneling application. It’s highly versatile and can  be used to tunnel just about any protocol through a secure, encrypted channel.  Natively, stunnel doesn’t provide the X-Forwarded-For header that is so useful when proxying  web traffi c. But a patch from the HAProxy website adds this. As such, you need to compile stunnel  from source.   NOTE  Grab the latest stunnel source from ftp:  ftp.stunnel.org stunnel   and the X-Forwarded-For patch from http:  haproxy.1wt.eu download  patches  for the corresponding version.   Patching is simply a matter of running the following from inside the stunnel source directory:  patch -p1 < .. stunnel-4.44-xforwarded-for.diff  The standard confi guration  make, make install route  can then be used. The fi nal touches are  to create a user for stunnel to run as and set appropriate ownerships, as shown here:  useradd stunnel touch  var log stunnel.log chown stunnel:stunnel  var log stunnel.log chown -R stunnel:stunnel  var run stunnel chown -R stunnel:stunnel  usr local etc stunnel  Confi guring stunnel  by default via  usr local etc stunnel stunnel.conf  is straightforward.  After a few global options, you create a section for each IP address that you want to act as an SSL  endpoint. The following confi guration block lists the certifi cate to use, the IP:port to listen on, and  the IP:port to proxy on to  HAProxy, in this case :  cert= etc stunnel stunnel.pem setuid=stunnel setgid=stunnel pid= var run stunnel stunnel.pid output =  var log stunnel.log  [https]   cert= etc stunnel server.crt   key= etc stunnel server.key   accept=1.2.3.4:443  Our external IP address   connect=127.0.0.1:80   Assuming HAProxy listening on 80 TCP on local machine   xforwardedfor=yes  c11.indd   367 c11.indd   367  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   368  ❘  CHAPTER 11  WORKING WITH SECURE SOCKETS LAYER  SSL   Now, you simply run the stunnel binary. HTTPS traffi c hitting port 443 TCP of 1.2.3.4 will be  routed to HAProxy listening on port 80 — presumably you also want to listen for client traffi c over  HTTP and send it straight to HAProxy.  stunnel doesn’t have much scope for performance tuning, but you can disable the Nagle algorithm   used for reducing the number of packets needing to be sent  in both directions by adding the  following options to the global section:  socket=l:TCP_NODELAY=1 socket=r:TCP_NODELAY=1  SSL Termination with stud  In addition, it makes sense to compile stunnel without tcpwrappers support  . configure— disable-libwrap  because this feature is not needed in this situation.  stunnel uses a threaded model for handling client connections. Although this is certainly preferable  to the one-client-per-process approach, it still isn’t optimal. stud  https:  github.com bumptech  stud  is a newer SSL tunneling daemon built around an event-driven model, running one process  per CPU core. As such, stud should scale better than stunnel. It even includes support for passing  the origin IP address to HAProxy without the need for any third-party patches.  There’s no confi guration fi le for stud, so you just launch it with the appropriate command-line  options, as shown here:  stud --ssl -b 127.0.0.1,80 -f 1.2.3.4,443 -n 4 --write-proxy  Here, --ssl enables SSL version 3. -b specifi es the back-end server  HAProxy, in this case , and  -f specifi es the front-end  the public IP address on which to listen . Note that the IP address  and port are separated by a comma. The -n option enables you to set the number of worker  processes, which should be one per core. So, in this example, you would run on a quad core  machine. Finally, the --write-proxy option sends a PROXY header  containing the client IP address   to the back-end server at the beginning of each connection. HAProxy uses this to pass the client’s  IP address to the back-end web servers.  Options also exist for logging and running as an unprivileged user or inside a chroot jail — see the  man pages for full details.  SENDING INTERMEDIATE CERTIFICATES  It isn’t just the number of round trips in the handshake that causes a slowdown when using SSL. The  amount of data being transferred also has an impact. And it isn’t just about bandwidth. The TCP  congestion windows mean that, in the early stages of a connection, even small amounts of data can  increase latency because of the need for the client to acknowledge  through ACK  the data.  Step 2 of the SSL handshake involves the server sending its certifi cate to the client. Many certifi cate  issuers use intermediates  that is, the end certifi cate has been signed against an intermediate  certifi cate, not a root certifi cate , though, so it may not just be the end certifi cate that is sent to   c11.indd   368 c11.indd   368  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   Selecting Cipher Suites  ❘  369  the client — one or more intermediate certifi cates may need to be sent, too. Finding an issuer that  doesn’t use intermediates is probably overkill, but it does make sense to avoid issuers that require  more than one intermediate.  What happens if you don’t confi gure the intermediate certifi cate in the web server? This will cut  the amount of data that is sent, and will actually probably still work in many browsers, but it also  results in worse performance. In this situation, many browsers have the intelligence to attempt to  fetch the intermediate certifi cate directly  from the issuer’s website , but this causes another HTTPS  request  and DNS look-up fi rst , so performance is worse overall. It fl ies in the face of standards,  too, and could easily break in future browsers.  DETERMINING KEY SIZES  Closely related to the issue of sending intermediate certifi cates is the issue of key sizes. These days,  most issuers refuse to accept certifi cate signing requests  CSRs  generated using RSA keys smaller  than 1,024 bits — it simply isn’t deemed secure enough any longer. So, the usual choices are 2,048  or 4,096. It may seem obvious to go with 4,096 bits  — the more security the better, right?  The answer is “yes” and “no.” If you’re in a line of business that demands the utmost security, a  large key size is best. But for the average e-commerce site, 2,048 bits is more than adequate.  Current guidelines suggest that computational power won’t have advanced enough to make cracking  2,048-bit keys feasible until at least the year 2030. Because most web masters purchase their SSL  certifi cates for 1 or 2 years, this shouldn’t be a concern when purchasing a certifi cate at the moment.  So, the extra security offered by 4,096-bit keys is overkill in most situations. But what a 4,096-bit  key does do is increase the size of the SSL certifi cate sent is step 2 of the SSL handshake, and the  keys exchanged in step 3.   Larger keys also mean more work when encrypting and decrypting data  both client- and server- side . Operations using a 4,096-bit key are approximately fi ve times slower than with a 2,048-bit  key. And the performance hit isn’t just during the handshake. It happens for every HTTPS packet.  This may not have much effect client-side, but for a server handling hundreds of SSL requests per  second, it can make a huge difference in performance. As you’ll see next, the choice of a cipher suite  can also have a signifi cant impact on performance.   SELECTING CIPHER SUITES  Unless you’re particularly security conscious, the cipher suite’s listing of encryption methods  supported by a web server may be unfamiliar territory. Cipher suites are about more than just  encryption of the data stream. Recall that keys must be exchanged, message digests created, and  random  well, pseudo-random  numbers generated during the handshake. A cipher suite defi nes  the algorithms used for all these.  In Apache, SSLCipherSuite is used to list  in order of preference  the cipher suites that the web  server is willing to speak. When a client connects and advertises its list of support suites, the  web server picks the best  highest ranking  match from its list.  c11.indd   369 c11.indd   369  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   370  ❘  CHAPTER 11  WORKING WITH SECURE SOCKETS LAYER  SSL   Things quickly become complicated because of the sheer number of possible combinations of algo- rithms. Some combinations are considered insecure, some are only available if OpenSSL has been  compiled with particular options, and others are disabled by default because of legal restrictions on  strong encryption. To complicate matters further, SSL even allows for renegotiation where initial  communications are established via one cipher suite, which is then used to upgrade to a stronger  method.  The default cipher string in Apache version 2.2 looks like this:  SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP  In addition to allowing you to explicitly set the algorithms to use, numerous aliases are supported  to simplify the string. The example given here starts by enabling all algorithms  ALL , and then  excludes Diffi e-Helman key exchanges  ADH . Next, the example gives preference to RC4 cipher  encoding with RSA authentication and key exchange. What follows are the HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW  aliases, support for SSL version 2, and, fi nally, all export ciphers  EXP .  In practice, this isn’t a great default. SSL version 2 has security fl aws, and low-strength ciphers give  a false sense of security. The default cipher string on Debian’s Apache2 package is as follows:  SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!ADH  In other words, it allows any high- or medium-strength cipher, but never allows ADH.  What does this all have to do with performance? As might be expected, there is a signifi cant  difference in performance between algorithms.   When using the HIGH alias, the fi rst algorithm in the list is currently AES-256, which is  approximately three times slower than RC4. Although AES-256 is certainly more secure, RC4 is  still considered “good enough” if implemented correctly. So, for the average e-commerce site, RC4  is still a perfectly acceptable option. Google even uses RC4 plus SHA1 for SSL, and endorsements  don’t come much bigger than that.  A suitable cipher string to make this the default would be as follows:  SSLCipherSuite RC4-SHA:ALL:!ADH:!EXP:!LOW:!MD5:!SSLV2:!NULL  NOTE  For security, various weak methods have been explicitly disabled.  The fi nal thing to do is force your fi rst choice on the client, rather than letting the client choose its  preferred method:  SSLHonorCipherOrder on  With this directive enabled, the server’s preferences are given priority over the client’s.  c11.indd   370 c11.indd   370  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   The Future of SSL  ❘  371  Having looked in detail at confi guration options that can affect performance, let’s take a brief look  at hardware considerations  INVESTING IN HARDWARE ACCELERATION  Dedicated SSL-processing hardware is available, usually in the form of a PCI card. However,  because of the price, it’s often just as economical to invest in more CPU power.  In recent years, both Intel and AMD have started producing chips that support Advanced  Encryption Standard  AES  instructions  AES-NI , with the aim to make AES encryption  decryption signifi cantly faster. As of this writing, this feature is limited to the AMD Bulldozer,  as well as the Intel Westmere and Sandy Bridge processors. It should be stressed that only some  members of these families support AES-NI.  Of course, to use these new AES instructions, software must be aware of their existence. The latest  versions of OpenSSL support AES-NI, and patches are available for some earlier versions.  If you have a CPU that supports AES-NI, RC4-SHA may not be the fastest option after all.  AES-256 is probably still overkill, though, and a good trade-off is to use AES-128, giving the  benefi t of AES-NI without the expense of 256-bit keys.  SSLCipherSuite AES-128:RC4-SHA:ALL:!ADH:!EXP:!LOW:!MD5:!SSLV2:!NULL  THE FUTURE OF SSL  A number of SSL-related technologies and extensions are currently in the development pipeline.  Some have been around for a few years now and are gradually gaining popularity. Others are still  experimental but will likely become important within the new few years.  Part of the reason for slow adoption of these extensions is that many require changes in both the  client and server. So, although it’s easy to hack your web server to support the latest extension, it’s  not much use if you need to wait a few years for web browsers to start implementing the extensions.  The following technologies are still new enough not to have widespread support yet, but are also  mature enough for you to be confi dent that they aren’t just a fl ash in the pan. In years to come, they  will likely become important parts of SSL setups, so it’s certainly worth becoming acquainted with  them now.   OCSP Stapling  When a browser connects to a website over SSL, there is usually a need to check that the certifi cate  has not been revoked. The standard way to do this is via the Online Certifi cate Status Protocol   OCSP , in which the client issues an OCSP request to the certifi cate issuers. Of course, this  necessitates that the client perform an additional DNS lookup and send a query to the issuer, so  performance suffers.  c11.indd   371 c11.indd   371  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   372  ❘  CHAPTER 11  WORKING WITH SECURE SOCKETS LAYER  SSL   With OCSP stapling, the web server provides an OCSP response guaranteeing the validity of the  certifi cate. The response is included with the certifi cate in step 2 of the SSL handshake. Although it  may seem insecure allowing the server to guarantee its own certifi cate, the OCSP response is signed  by the issuer, offering the assurance that it has not been tampered with.  There are advantages and disadvantages to OCSP stapling. It saves the client the expense to send an  additional query to the issuer  which would probably involve a DNS look-up, too . It also improves  client privacy — with the traditional method, the issuer could learn the client’s browsing habits by  tracking for which certifi cates a status request is being made.   The downside of stapling is that it increases the amount of data sent during the SSL handshake.  You’ve already learned about certifi cate sizes and intermediate certifi cates, and how they affect the  TCP congestion window. The presence of an OCSP response is likely to exacerbate this. It’s worth  noting, too, that stapling has no benefi t server-side. It’s only a performance boost for the client.  As of this writing, Apache version 2.3 supports stapling, but Nginx does not.   False Start  Developed by Google for its Chrome browser, False Start is a client-side modifi cation that speeds up  the SSL handshake.   Recall the fi nal two steps of the full SSL handshake — the client sends its key along with a fi nish  message  step 3 , and then waits for the server to acknowledge this with its own “fi nish” message   step 4 . Only then does the client send its HTTP request.   False Start recognizes that it is largely unnecessary for the client to wait for the server’s “fi nish”  message before sending a request. Instead, the client can send a request after step 3 — in this way,  you eliminate the latency of one trip.  According to Google’s fi gures  http:  blog.chromium.org 2011 05  ssl-falsestart-performance-results.html , less than one-half a percent of web servers have  trouble handling False Start, and Google maintains a blacklist of affected sites. The blacklist is  publically available and used by Firefox’s implementation of False Start  although it is disabled by  default .  SUMMARY  SSL inevitably has a performance impact on both client and server. There is a lot that can be done to  improve performance, however, and it doesn’t need to be a serious drain on resources.  On multiserver setups, using an SSL endpoint in front of the load balancer is popular for two  reasons:   ➤ It lets the load balancer to work with unencrypted HTTP traffi c, allowing for balancing   based on packet contents.   ➤ It provides the most effi cient option for caching SSL sessions.  c11.indd   372 c11.indd   372  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   Summary  ❘  373  The downside to using an endpoint is that it can easily become a bottleneck. Think carefully before  introducing what could become a serious barrier to scalability.  The alternative is to allow each back-end server to handle SSL, but this makes caching of sessions  more tricky. Apache, Nginx, and stunnel support distributed caching via memcache, but this can  reduce performance, too, because of the nonasynchronous nature of the memcache GETs SETs.  Some CPUs support AES-NI instructions, which provide a signifi cant boost for AES encryption. If  you use such CPUs, consider AES-128 over AES-256 — it’s secure enough and a lot faster. For CPUs  that don’t support AES-NI, RC4 is a lot faster than AES.  In Chapter 12, you learn about how to optimize PHP to enhance performance.  c11.indd   373 c11.indd   373  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   c11.indd   374 c11.indd   374  05 11 12   4:53 PM 05 11 12   4:53 PM   12  Optimizing PHP  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?   ➤ Using opcode caching to speed up execution   ➤ Handling PHP sessions   ➤ Proﬁ ling bottlenecks with xhprof   ➤ Optimizing your PHP code  With so many different programming languages and development frameworks in use on the  modern web, it would be impossible to even attempt to do them justice trying to completely  cover them in a single book. Since PHP has easily become the most popular web scripting  language in UNIX Linux environments, it’s worth delving a bit deeper into how the language  affects performance.  The downside to the popularity of back-end scripting is, of course, higher performance over- heads. Although PHP scripts are typically fairly lightweight, they are still a lot slower to serve  up than static HTML documents. In the case of heavier scripts, there can be a signifi cant  performance hit — both for the client  in the form of higher latency in requests , and for the  server  in the form of higher resource usage, and a lower limit on the number of concurrent  requests . In this chapter, you learn about a variety of ways in which PHP performance can be  improved, both in how the operating system executes it, and in the language itself.  This chapter starts with a look at PHP modules and extensions — how too many extensions  can adversely affect performance, as well as situations in which it can be worth writing your  own. After that, you learn about opcode caching, a powerful technique that can overcome  many of the limitations of an interpreted language. You also learn about why Alternative PHP  Cache  APC  is rapidly becoming the standard in this fi eld.  Sessions are widely used in PHP, but introduce their own performance considerations —  particularly in load-balanced environments, where a means to share session data across   c12.indd   375 c12.indd   375  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   376  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  back-end servers is sometimes needed. In this chapter, you discover various solutions to these  problems, including the use of memcache to store session data.  The remainder of the chapter examines considerations of the language itself  regular expressions,  loops, including fi les, and so on , and how to profi le your code to discover where the bottlenecks are  occurring.  EXTENSIONS AND COMPILING  With many applications, there is signifi cant scope for optimization at the installation stage when  decisions are made on which modules to compile in or enable. PHP is no different, and in this  section, you learn how PHP handles extensions, and the effect that they can have on performance.  Removing Unneeded Extensions  The PHP source code comes bundled with more than 80 extensions that provide additional  functionality, ranging from image manipulation to XML parsing to database interaction. When  compiling PHP, you have the option of building extensions statically into the PHP binary, or as  shared modules that can be loaded at run time.  From a performance point of view, the primary advantage of using shared extensions  is that only  one instance of the module must be loaded into memory, and can be shared across multiple PHP  instances. This can cut memory usage substantially. Aside from that, shared extensions are also  more convenient, because they can easily be loaded or unloaded via php.ini. Static extensions  must be built into PHP at compile time, making it more awkward to change which extensions are  enabled.  The one disadvantage to compiling in extensions is that there is a little extra overhead involved in  dynamically loading shared extensions. Generally, though, the advantages of shared extensions   on memory usage  far outweigh this.  People often give the vague reason that removing unrequired extensions is to reduce bloat. But  what precisely does this mean? In Chapter 7, “Working with Web Servers,” you learned about  Apache’s prefork Multi-Process Module  MPM  and how the worker MPM isn’t suitable for use  with PHP. You also learned how the memory footprint of each Apache thread has a direct infl uence  on the maximum concurrency you can support. Thus, your goal is to keep the Resident Set Size  RSS   usage as low as possible for each Apache thread.  Running the PHP Apache module has a signifi cant impact on memory usage. Although each thread  in a PHP-free Apache setup may have a typical RSS of 4 MB or 5 MB, enabling libphp5.so with  most of the bundled extensions can easily shoot this up to more than 50 MB. In some ways, this is a  worst-case scenario, but there are plenty of system administrators who use apt-get or yum install  for every available PHP package, simply to avoid the inconvenience of PHP moaning at a later date  that a particular extension isn’t installed. So, there’s potentially a lot to be gained from keeping PHP  lean, and you should disable any modules that you don’t currently need.   Table 12-1 shows the size of some of the most common modules in a PHP version 5.3 installation.  c12.indd   376 c12.indd   376  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Extensions and Compiling  ❘  377  TABLE 12-1:  PHP Module Sizes  EXTENSION  SIZE  KB   apc.so  curl.so  ffmpeg.so  gd.so  imagick.so  imap.so  mysqli.so  mysql.so  sasl.so  tidy.so  655  62  35  94  328  86  107  42  15  42  As you can see, there’s quite a difference in sizes, with the heaviest taking up more than one-half  a megabyte. This isn’t the full story, though, because these modules are invariably linked to other  libraries. As an example, consider curl:  $ ldd curl.so         linux-gate.so.1 =>   0xffffe000          libcurl.so.4 =>  usr lib libcurl.so.4  0xb7f75000          libc.so.6 =>  lib i686 cmov libc.so.6  0xb7e2f000          libidn.so.11 =>  usr lib libidn.so.11  0xb7dfd000          libssh2.so.1 =>  usr lib libssh2.so.1  0xb7ddc000          liblber-2.4.so.2 =>  usr lib liblber-2.4.so.2  0xb7dd0000          libldap_r-2.4.so.2 =>  usr lib libldap_r-2.4.so.2  0xb7d8b000          librt.so.1 =>  lib i686 cmov librt.so.1  0xb7d82000          libgssapi_krb5.so.2 =>  usr lib libgssapi_krb5.so.2  0xb7d52000          libssl.so.0.9.8 =>  usr lib i686 cmov libssl.so.0.9.8  0xb7d08000          libcrypto.so.0.9.8 =>  usr lib i686 cmov libcrypto.so.0.9.8  0xb7bb0000          libz.so.1 =>  usr lib libz.so.1  0xb7b9c000           lib ld-linux.so.2  0x80000000          libgcrypt.so.11 =>  usr lib libgcrypt.so.11  0xb7b28000          libresolv.so.2 =>  lib i686 cmov libresolv.so.2  0xb7b13000          libsasl2.so.2 =>  usr lib libsasl2.so.2  0xb7afc000          libgnutls.so.26 =>  usr lib libgnutls.so.26  0xb7a64000          libpthread.so.0 =>  lib i686 cmov libpthread.so.0  0xb7a4b000          libkrb5.so.3 =>  usr lib libkrb5.so.3  0xb7999000          libk5crypto.so.3 =>  usr lib libk5crypto.so.3  0xb7975000          libcom_err.so.2 =>  lib libcom_err.so.2  0xb7972000          libkrb5support.so.0 =>  usr lib libkrb5support.so.0  0xb796b000          libdl.so.2 =>  lib i686 cmov libdl.so.2  0xb7967000          libkeyutils.so.1 =>  lib libkeyutils.so.1  0xb7964000          libgpg-error.so.0 =>  usr lib libgpg-error.so.0  0xb795f000          libtasn1.so.3 =>  usr lib libtasn1.so.3  0xb794f000   c12.indd   377 c12.indd   377  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   378  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  On Linux, the ldd command displays a list of shared libraries linked in to a binary. So, in addition  to the memory footprint of curl.so, there is the footprint of each of these libraries to consider.   For example, libcurl.so.4 is 359 KB on this particular machine.    Things aren’t as simple as just adding up the size of each of these libraries, however. The whole  point of a shared library is that only one instance must be loaded into memory because it can be  shared across multiple processes. So, in this example, the additional footprint of curl.so might  be zero if each of these shared libraries has already been loaded into memory by another process   be it another PHP process, or a completely unrelated application .   Common libraries such as libcrypto and libssl will almost certainly already be in memory,  whereas more esoteric ones such as libXdmcp.so  which provides interaction with the X Display  Manager and is linked in to gd.so on Linux  probably won’t be. All this means that determining  the memory footprint of a particular PHP extension is no simple matter. Actually, it’s somewhat  ambiguous as to how you even defi ne the memory footprint.   Unless you are overly obsessive about memory usage, avoid the headache of attempting to calculate  a module’s memory usage, and go down the simple route of just disabling modules that you don’t  need.  One source of frustration is that some extensions may be needed only occasionally, and, yet,  by enabling them, they will be running for every Apache thread. A classic example would be a  CAPTCHA image on a contact form. You might not need gd.so at all on the rest of the site, yet you  need to enable it so that you can generate some unreadable text on a patterned background for a  contact form.   PHP used to allow you to load extensions at run time via the dl   function. However, for stability  reasons, as of PHP version 5.3, this has been disabled in the Common Gateway Interface  CGI  and  Apache scheduling application programming interfaces  SAPIs .  It will still work via the command- line client.  Hopefully, this feature will return in the future.  If you use a version of PHP supplied with your distribution, chances are that, although most of the  extensions have been compiled as shared modules, some have not. Thus, for full control, it is neces- sary to compile PHP from source.  Writing Your Own PHP Extensions  PHP extensions have all the usual benefi ts of being written in a compiled language  C  — they are  faster to execute and have a lower memory footprint; and there is a much lower delay before they  begin executing. That’s why extra features like GD or MySQL support are built as extensions rather  than PHP libraries.   Given the advantage of an extension over a script, there’s something to be said for recoding all or  parts of your PHP application as a PHP extension in C. At fi rst, this seems to defeat the whole point  of using a high-level language like PHP  fl exibility, ease of use, and rapid development . Why not  just write the application completely in C, and run it as a CGI, without the need for PHP?   In practice, a happy ground exists somewhere in the middle. Certain intensive functions could  be moved into an extension  because these will have the greatest potential for gain , keeping the  majority of the application as PHP code.   c12.indd   378 c12.indd   378  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Extensions and Compiling  ❘  379  This argument about the performance of compiled versus interpreted languages isn’t entirely accu- rate, though. As you’ll see later in this chapter, a popular method to boost the performance of PHP  scripts is through an opcode cache — basically, it stores the PHP script in a semi-compiled form,  reducing the performance hit of interpreting the script. Because of this, the performance of PHP  scripts can be much closer to that of a compiled language such as C, and the benefi ts of moving  code into a PHP extension aren’t so clear-cut. Actually, it may not prove to be worth your time and  money to do this, especially because the gains may be quite modest.   Custom PHP extensions are by no means pointless, but they are defi nitely something to consider  only after you have exhausted the possibilities described in this chapter.  Compiling  Aside from giving you complete control over installed modules, compiling PHP from the source  also enables you to implement the usual compile-time performance options  such as CPU-specifi c  features and higher levels of optimization . For example, with GCC under Linux, the -O3 switch is  commonly used to produce a higher level of optimization.  A particularly useful confi guration fl ag is --disable-all, which disables the extensions that are  usually enabled by default. You can selectively re-enable them later in the list of . configure  options. Remember that, for Apache, you must compile --with-apxs, whereas for FastCGI   for example, when using PHP with Nginx  you must build in CGI support  enabled by default .  Following are two particularly useful options:   ➤ --enable-inline-optimiziation — This causes the C compiler  for example, GCC under   Linux  to use function inlining when compiling the PHP binary. Note that this applies  only to PHP — it emphatically does not cause function inlining to be used when your PHP  scripts are parsed and compiled.    ➤ --disable-debug — This causes PHP to be built without debugging symbols. Actually, the   default these days is not to compile in debugging symbols anyway  rather, you must explic- itly enable them using --enable-debug , so this option is redundant.  INLINING  Inlining, a technique familiar to C programmers, is a compile-time strategy that  involves replacing function calls with the body of the function. Consider the  following code:  for  $x=0; $x<=100; $x++  {       $sqr =  getsquare $x ; }  function getsquare $x  {     return  $x * $x ; }  continues  c12.indd   379 c12.indd   379  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   380  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  continued  Each time getsquare is called, there is overhead involved. Variables are pushed  and popped from the stack, execution jumps to a different region of memory, the  function’s return value is passed back to the caller via the stack, and so on. With  inlining, the compiler removes this overhead by rewriting the code to something  like this:  for  $x=0; $x<=100; $x++  {     $sqr =  $x * $x ; }  In this example, inlining actually reduces the size of the code, but in most situations,  there will be an increase — imagine if the getsquare function was much larger and  called from dozens of different points in the code.   So, the downside is extra work for the compiler and an increase in the code size.  The benefi t is faster execution of the resulting code.  COMPILER FLAGS  As with any other C application, compiler fl ags  CFLAGS  can often be used to  improve performance. On x86 UNIX Linux, setting the -prefer-non-pic fl ag  causes non-position-independent code to be built, which produces a noticeable  increase in performance. Position-independent code  PIC  refers to code that can  be executed, regardless of its absolute address in memory. It is commonly used for  shared libraries, but is slower than non-PIC code. Similarly, the -march fl ag can be  used to specify your CPU architecture, allowing additional processor-specifi c  optimizations to take place.   As usual, it’s also standard to compile with the -O3 level of optimization, which  can potentially improve performance. The overall build process on Linux may look  something like this:  $ export CFLAGS="-march=opteron -prefer-non-pic -O3" $ . configure --enable-inline-optimization  $ make $ sudo make install $ sudo strip  usr lib apache2 modules libphp5.so  The fi nal step strips any additional debugging symbols from libphp5.so, resulting  in a smaller binary.  Just don’t hope to diagnose any crashes with gdb.   c12.indd   380 c12.indd   380  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Opcode Caching  ❘  381  By now, you should have a good idea of how best to install and confi gure PHP on your system.  In the next section, you discover perhaps the single most effective means of boosting PHP  performance — opcode caching.  OPCODE CACHING  Scripted languages such as PHP, Python, and Perl are easy to deploy. You simply write and run. This  is in contrast to languages like C, where you must go through the additional step of compiling your  code before you can run it. This convenience comes at a cost, though, and interpreted languages are  never as fast as compiled ones.  In PHP, execution happens in two steps:    1.  The lexical parser compiles the script into opcode  sometimes also referred to as bytecode .    2.  The Zend engine at the heart of PHP executes the opcode.   This happens every time the script is executed. Recompiling code like this is rather wasteful of  resources, and one of the most popular and effi cient methods to improve PHP performance is  through the use of opcode caches.  In addition to caching the compiled opcode for future use, these caches often also perform  optimization of the PHP code prior to compiling. Although, on its own, optimization would  hurt performance overall  what you gain through optimized code, you lose in the overhead involved  in performing the optimization , when coupled with opcode caching, this provides an additional  performance boost.  Variations of Opcode Caches  Unfortunately, opcode caches have historically been the subject of much bigotry, and the Internet is  full of users who insist that cache X is several orders of magnitude better than cache Y. Often, these  claims are backed up by half-baked statistics, and it doesn’t take long to fi nd an alternative bench- mark that shows cache Y is, actually, several orders of magnitude better than cache X. This is one  area in which benchmarks are even less meaningful than normal.  The opcode landscape has changed quite a bit in the last few years, though. So, rather than being  too preoccupied with benchmarks, it may be better to think in terms of which opcode caches are  actually still maintained.   For a long time, the big three were XCache  written by the author of lighttpd , Turck MMCache,  and eAccelerator  itself a fork of MMCache . eAccelerator has been a personal favorite of the author,  but neither it nor MMCache are maintained any longer. In addition, there is a new rival in town in  the shape of Alternative PHP Cache  APC . Although APC is not quite as fast as the competition   yet , it has the weight of the PHP team behind it and is set to become the primary opcode cache for  PHP. Thus, this is the recommended cache,, so let’s take a closer look at it.  c12.indd   381 c12.indd   381  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   382  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  Getting to Know APC  In the near future, APC will be bundled with PHP as an extension. But until that time, the standard  way to install it is via PECL  pecl install apc . Alternatively, your distribution may provide a  php-pecl package, but, as previously noted, it’s much better to compile PHP from source.  Depending on how you install, entries may be added to php.ini to load and confi gure APC, or a  separate confi guration fi le may be created  most likely under  etc php5 conf.d  . Or you may  need to do it yourself.  A minimum confi guration such as the following would simply load the APC extension:  However, you will almost certainly want to set some of the many options available.  extension=apc.so  Memory Management  The fi rst decision is whether to use shared memory  shm  or mapped memory  mmap , and likely this  decision has already been made for you. If PECL has compiled APC with --enable-mmap, your  system supports mmap, and this is the method that will be used. If not, the older shm method will be  used. There isn’t a huge difference in performance between the two. shm is more portable, but mmap  is slightly more effi cient with memory management.  Regardless of the memory method used, apc.shm_size controls the size of the each memory seg- ment, whereas apc.shm_segments controls the number of segments. With mmap  the default under  Linux , apc.shm_segments has no effect.  The default cache size is 32 MB, which is a reasonable  default for the moment. If you’re using shm, larger values may require fi rst raising the shared  memory size, as shown here:   cat  proc sys kernel shmmax 33554432     32 MB  sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=67108864  Optimization  As previously mentioned, some opcodes also support optimization of the code prior to compiling  and caching. APC is one of these, but optimization is still marked as “experimental” and may not  produce signifi cant speed increases. This option was removed in APC version 3 but may return in  the future.  Time-To-Live  TTL   Left to its own accord, APC will happily continue to add entries to the cache until it becomes full.  At that point, no new entries will be added, but potentially stale content will remain. Like all good  caches of a fi nite size, APC utilizes a Time-To-Live  TTL  to set the maximum lifetime for cache   c12.indd   382 c12.indd   382  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Opcode Caching  ❘  383  entries. When this limit is reached, expired entries will be purged from the cache if space is needed  for new entries. This option is controlled by apc.ttl and defaults to zero. If a TTL of zero is set,  the whole cache will be purged if it becomes full.  An hour or two is a reasonable default for the TTL, but a lot depends on available system memory  and the number of scripts that may potentially be cached. For example, with a large number of  scripts, it may be impractical to set aside enough memory to cache them all, and a lower TTL may  be needed to keep the cache size down. In most cases, though, it’s better to increase the size of the  cache to hold as much as is reasonably possible.  The other issue with cache TTL is that entries can become stale — even if your script is edited, PHP  will still continue to use the cached version. APC gets around this by issuing a stat   on the fi le  and checking the mtime each time it is about to request the compiled version from the cache. If the  fi le on the fi lesystem is more recent than the timestamp on the compiled version, the cache entry is  expired.  The fi rst problem here is that the mtime isn’t always a reliable indication that the fi le has changed.  Tools such as rsync and svn may modify a fi le’s mtime, even if the content hasn’t changed. Thus,  you end up purging entries from the cache when it was unnecessary.  APC can be confi gured to also check a fi le’s ctime, as shown here:  apc.stat =1   standard mtime check apc.stat_ctime = 1  also check ctime  This isn’t ideal either, but for a different reason. Running stat   on every PHP script prior to  executing is a drag on disk performance, especially when the vast majority of the time, the script  won’t have been changed. You can set both of these stat settings to zero to disable stat   checks,  but if you subsequently alter a fi le, you must clear the entire cache  at present there’s no way to  delete a single entry  — either by executing apc_clear_cache or restarting Apache. Despite this,  disabling stat   is still defi nitely the preferred option on production servers.  Locking  APC supports the following four locking methods:   ➤ File locks — These are the most stable but offer poor performance.   ➤ IPC semaphores — These are faster than fi le locks and well supported.   ➤ Pthread mutex — These are only available in Linux version 2.6 onward but offer a much   greater performance gain.   ➤ Spin locks — These offer the best performance of all but are still considered experimental.  If you feel brave, spin locks can be enabled when confi guring APC with --enable-apc-spinlocks.  In most cases, pthread mutexes are best, though, which are the default when building APC through  PECL on Linux version 2.6.  c12.indd   383 c12.indd   383  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   384  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  One situation in which locking comes into play  and in which lock performance can have a big  impact  is when there is a fl ood of requests for an uncached resource — perhaps because the server  has just come online, or the resource has been modifi ed and purged from the cache. Either way, you  encounter a situation in which multiple PHP processes simultaneously compile the script and then  attempt to insert it into the cache — a process known as slamming.  Earlier versions of APC dealt with slamming via the apc.slam_defense setting. This value told  PHP not to bother caching a script that it had just compiled  but was not in the cache  a certain  percentage of the time. The rationale here was that it was likely that other PHP processes could  also be attempting to insert the opcode into the cache. By setting a value of, say, 80 percent,  only one in fi ve processes would attempt to insert into the cache, reducing the severity of the  slamming.   Of course, if the server isn’t busy, the likelihood of two processes compiling the same script at the  same time is low, and this defense simply delays the caching, so it isn’t an ideal solution. Instead,  the preferred solution now is by enabling apc.write_lock. This causes the fi rst PHP process to  handle an uncached script to set a lock, preventing other processes from caching it.  Now that you are familiar with the most important runtime confi guration options for APC, let’s  look at a confi guration fi le that should serve as a good starting point in the majority of cases:  Sample apc.ini  extension=apc.so apc.enabled = 1 apc.stat = 0 apc.stat_ctime = 0 apc.slam_defense = 0 apc.write_lock = 1 apc.ttl = 7200 apc.optimization = 0  APC Caching Strategies  Memory is always a scarce resource, and, invariably, you discover that there isn’t enough room  to cache as much as you would like. You’ve already learned about the TTL setting  which is  used to control the size of the cache by automatically expiring items , but there are other  considerations, too.  As shown in Figure 12-1, fragmentation occurs when items are removed from the middle of the  cache, leaving a gap that is either not big enough to hold another item, or that holds an item but  leaves a small gap.   c12.indd   384 c12.indd   384  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Opcode Caching  ❘  385  Item X  Item Y  Item Z  Item X  Item Z  Item Y expires from the cache, leaving a region of free memory between items X and Z.  Item W is inserted into the gap, but this still leaves a small region of memory not big enough to hold another item.  Item X  Item W  Item Z  FIGURE 12-1  The more frequently you expire items from the cache  that is, the lower the TTL , the more likely  fragmentation is to occur.  The solution to this problem is simply to increase the size of the cache, such that even when  fragmentation does occur, there is still plenty of room. It may not be an elegant solution, but it is the  only one that you have.  With the knowledge that the cache is only a fi nite size, it might be worth thinking about what you  cache. APC caches everything by default, but it may be worth concentrating on only the most  frequently used code. After all, there is little to be gained from caching an admin-only script that  may be run only once or twice a day.  APC has two settings that provide control over exactly what is cached:    ➤ apc.cache_by_default — This controls whether to cache by default.   ➤ apc.filters — This lets you supply a comma-separated list of regexes to control what is   cached and what isn’t.  If cached_by_default is set to zero, the regexes in apc.filters can be prepended with a +, indi- cating that any fi le matching the pattern should be cached. Conversely, if cache_by_default is set  to one, the regexes can be prepended with a -, telling APC not to cache any matches.  So, if you want to cache everything except the contents of the  admin directory and a particularly  large script, you could use the following:  apc.cache_by_default = 1 apc.filters = "- var www html largescript.php, - var www html admin .*"  c12.indd   385 c12.indd   385  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   386  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  Or if you want to cache only the contents of a particular directory, you could use the following:  apc.cache_by_default = 0 apc.filters = "+ var www html some_dir .*"  Remember, though, that the fi lter will match the exact fi lename passed to include or require, which  may be a relative path.  Monitoring the Cache  APC comes bundled with a PHP script, apc.php, which provides a web interface for monitoring and  administration of the cache. If you have the PHP GD module enabled, you’ll also get some nice pie  charts showing cache usage and the hit-to-miss ratio.  The control panel also provides a complete list of every script in the cache, along with its size, the  number of hits it has received, and the access and creation times. This information can be invaluable  when deciding whether to exclude certain fi les or directories from the cache to save space.  An option to clear the cache is also provided, but this should be used as a last resort because there  will be a signifi cant spike in CPU usage.  Using APC as a Generic Cache  APC can also be used as a generic in-memory cache, much like memcache. Using APC in this way  has the benefi t of no latency being incurred when connecting to memcache  which may be running  on a different machine  and simplifi ed server administration because there is one less service to  manage.  The APC documentation  http:  www.php.net manual en book.apc.php  lists several functions  that you can use in your PHP code to set and fetch arbitrary data from APC. Naturally, this data  will persist across requests, which can make it a great way to avoid repeated database calls. The  following code writes a variable called foo  with a value of bar  to the cache and sets the TTL to  1 hour  3,600 seconds :  apc_add "foo", "bar", 3600 ;  You can later retrieve the value of foo like so:  $foo = apc_fetch "foo" ; print $foo;  Similar functions exist for deleting stored data, checking if a key exists, and incrementing  decrementing a value.  Does this mean that memcache is redundant? Certainly, APC is faster than memcache, but it cannot  be used in a distributed environment like memcache and can’t be used for permanent storage  like  membase . Remember that, in an Apache setup with libphp, restarting Apache will cause the cache  to be purged, so the data in APC can be more volatile than memcache. Thus, memcache certainly  isn’t redundant, but one option would be to use a two-tier caching system with APC as a smaller,  local cache, which is certainly worth exploring.  c12.indd   386 c12.indd   386  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Opcode Caching  ❘  387  Warming the Cache  Whether you choose to use APC as an opcode cache, or as a generic memory cache  or both , it can  be useful to preload data into the cache to avoid the heavy CPU usage incurred by a high ratio of  cache misses. On a busy site, bringing a server back into the pool with an empty cache can often  bring it to its knees.  If you’re using HAProxy, ramping can be used to gradually bring the server back into the pool,  slowly increasing the weight so that it is not swamped with connections until the cache has had a  chance to warm up. Alternatively, APC has a couple of tricks of its own.  You can use apc_compile_file   to ask APC to parse and compile a fi le and store the opcode in  the cache. In this way, you could write a priming script that calls apc_compile_file   for your  most accessed PHP scripts. By running the script before you bring the server back into the pool, you  can be confi dent that your cache is suitably primed. As an alternative, you could write a simple wget  or curl script to request certain pages over HTTP, thus also priming the cache.  APC also includes functions that allow you to read and write the entire contents of the cache, mak- ing it possible to dump the cache to disk and then subsequently re-importing it. This might be useful  if you must restart Apache but don’t want to lose the contents of the cache. Following is an example:  apc_bin_dumpfile null, null," tmp apcdump.data" ;  The fi rst two arguments to apc_bin_dumpfile are an array of fi les and user variables to dump.   You can leave these blank to dump all of them.  The fi nal argument is the fi lename to write to.  Importing this binary data back in is as simple as the following:  apc_bin_loadfile " tmp apcdump.data" ;  You could even incorporate this call into the Apache init script so that issuing an Apache restart  will cause APC to dump to disk before then importing after Apache has restarted.  Using APC with FastCGI  So far, this discussion has assumed that PHP is being run on top of Apache via mod_php  libphp5 ,  but this is far from the most optimal method for performance. Rather, many administrators choose  to run a lightweight web server such as Nginx with PHP requests being passed to a pool of FastCGI  daemons.  Over the years, PHP has supported several methods of running as a CGI, including fcgi and  FastCGI, and these methods have not worked well with APC. Rather than sharing the cache mem- ory between all processes, each PHP process would have its own private cache. With each process  being long-lived, there is still ample opportunity for caching, but if new processes are spawned   to cope with an increase in load , they will start with an empty cache. The whole arrangement isn’t  memory-effi cient anyway.  The good news is that the default FastCGI implementation in PHP is now PHP-FPM  FastCGI  Process Manager  which does allow the APC cache to be shared across all PHP processes.  c12.indd   387 c12.indd   387  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   388  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  Of course, one fundamental restriction on PHP’s effi ciency is because it is an interpreted language.  However, in the next section, you learn how work by Facebook and others has brought the  possibility of compiling PHP one step closer.   COMPILING PHP  Given that interpreted languages are inherently slower than compiled ones, the thought of compiling  PHP into an executable format is a tempting one. To some extent, this is what opcode caching  does — it stores your PHP code after it has been compiled into bytecode and allows this to be  reused. Bytecode still isn’t as fast as native machine code, though  because it must still be interpreted .  A true compiled program would offer signifi cant advantages.  Despite the potential gains, PHP compilation isn’t an area that has gained widespread interest. Over  the years, there have been numerous attempts to create a PHP compiler, and although some have  been reasonably successful, none have gone on to widespread usage.  phc  Phalanger  HipHop  One of the most interesting entries into this compiler arena was phc, a well thought-out compiler,  which sadly appears to have fi zzled out. A lot of work went into making phc compatible with  dynamic constructs  such as eval   statements, variables with dynamic names, and so on  — a  particular source of problems for any PHP compiler. Extensive testing was carried out on existing  PHP extensions and third-party code. So, although phc no longer appears to be in active develop- ment, it is well worth a look, as long as you appreciate the fact that you may be investing time in a  project that has no future.  For Windows users, the Phalanger compiler offers PHP compilation, in some sense of the word.  Phalanger does not generate native  machine  code. Rather, it compiles the PHP into common  intermediate language  CIL  bytecode, which can then be just in time  JIT  compiled by the .NET  framework. This probably isn’t quite what you’d expect from a PHP compiler, and little is done in  the way of optimization. Obviously, it’s also only suitable for .NET developers on Windows, so this  discussion won’t go into further detail.  HipHop is Facebook’s  open source  answer to this problem — a compiler that takes a PHP script,  converts it to C++, and then compiles this into an executable — either with or without its own built- in web server. Thus, HipHop can act as a complete replacement for the traditional setup of a web  server and PHP. In this topology, Nginx is often used as a front-end load balancer, providing some  of the features missing from HipHop’s fairly basic HTTP features.  How fast is HipHop? Facebook reported a 50 percent drop in CPU usage, which is a signifi cant  starting point, which will doubtlessly improve even more in the future. Although human-written  C++ has the potential to be much faster than this, it should be remembered that automatically   c12.indd   388 c12.indd   388  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Sessions  ❘  389  translating PHP to C++ can be a tricky business, particularly because of PHP’s weak typecasting  of variables. This is still one of those situations in which human judgment can win over a  computer.  Getting existing code to compile in HipHop is not a trivial matter either and often requires  some degree of rewriting. For example, HipHop has no support for PHP’s eval   or the mysqli  extension. These limitations mean that HipHop is currently only suitable for large sites that  can justify investing the time needed to make it work. For smaller sites, techniques such as  opcode caching  and caching in general  can produce greater gains and should be the fi rst line  of attack.  As you have seen, opcode caching is a very powerful means of boosting the performance of PHP,  and the APC extension is rapidly becoming the default choice. There are still plenty of other things  that can aid performance, however, and in the next section, you learn about the negative effects of  sessions, and how they can be reduced.  SESSIONS  Storing Sessions  Sessions tend to be used extensively in PHP as a means of keeping state, but they can be a source  of performance issues — particularly when multiple web servers are involved. In Chapter 7, you  learned about the issue of session affi nity and the various solutions that exist. Let’s recap briefl y.   By default, PHP stores session data in fi les  usually somewhere like  tmp or  var lib php  .  Although not perfect, this offers acceptable performance on moderately busy sites. The problems  start when you run a pool of web servers behind a load-balancing proxy. With fi le-based sessions,  you must ensure that each request from a particular client always goes to the same back-end server  — if the requests hit a different server, the session fi le won’t be there.  The solution to this is to use sticky sessions  also known as session affi nity . Here, the load balancer  will use various techniques  looking at the client’s IP address, setting a cookie, and so on  to ensure  that the client always goes to the same back-end server. This isn’t perfect either, though. It’s more  work for the load balancer and stops you from using other balancing algorithms to ensure an even  distribution of load across the back-end servers.  At this stage, some administrators look into using network fi lesystem  NFS  to provide a centralized  fi lesystem to hold the session fi les. However, NFS performance is poor, and this route is something  of a dead-end.  As a result, it’s usually best to move away from storing session data in the fi lesystem. MySQL  is often the next choice, and, at fi rst, it seems to be an attractive alternative. Chances are that  you’re already running MySQL, and PHP can easily be confi gured to use it for holding sessions.  Again, it works reasonably well, but performance suffers on busy sites, and with MySQL so  often being a bottleneck, you don’t want to be burdening it with a large number of additional  queries.  c12.indd   389 c12.indd   389  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   390  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  Storing Sessions in memcache membase  A favorite solution is to use memcache as a decentralized session store. Again, PHP has built-in sup- port for this, and using memcache is as simple as setting the following options in php.ini:  session.save_handler = memcache session.save_path = "tcp:  192.168.0.100:11211"  NOTE  Incidentally, if you’re thinking that MySQL’s MEMORY engine would be  just as good, you may want to refer back to the discussion in the section, “mem- cache versus MySQL MEMORY Engine,” in Chapter 10, “Utilizing NoSQL  Solutions.”  The main drawback to using memcache is that you don’t have persistence. If memcache goes down,  you lose your session data. Sometimes this is a minor inconvenience to your users and just requires  them to log back in. But on an e-commerce site, it may result in customers losing the content of their  shopping carts, which will not endear them to shopping with you in future.  Using Shared Memory or tmpfs  If only one web server is used  or, at least, just one web server that needs access to session  data — there could be another web server handling static content , you can store session data in  memory. This speeds up access and cuts down on disk I O.  One option is to use PHP’s built-in shared memory-based session storage module, MM.  Alternatively you can continue to store session data in fi les but write them to a RAM disk.  In  etc fstab, add the following:  tmpfs  var lib php5 tmpfs size=128M,atime 0 0  Then, issue the following:  mount  var lib php5  For a single web server, this makes more sense than using memcache  be it locally or over the  network . Even with multiple web servers, you can still use this technique with sticky sessions to  eliminate a global memcache instance from being a single point of failure.  There are two downsides to this method:    ➤ It’s not persistent. It’s nice to have web servers that you can swap out at your leisure    for example, to reboot or perform upgrades on , but if you do this, you lose the  session data.    ➤ It’s eating up precious memory, and depending on your session length and the amount of   data stored, this could be signifi cant.   c12.indd   390 c12.indd   390  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Sessions  ❘  391  Overall, the memcache membase solution is preferred because it removes the need for session affi nity,  offers persistence, and allows less-frequently accessed session data to be pushed out to disk. There’s  no point in holding session data in memory for a few hours if the user is long gone.  Session AutoStart  PHP offers the option  via session.auto_start  to automatically start sessions on each page,  saving you from manually calling session_start  . While this might seem like rather a useful  feature, it’s usually better not to enable it. As you’ve seen, there is a performance penalty associated  with starting or resuming a session, and there are often instances where you need sessions on some  pages, but not all. By only calling session_start   on pages where it is really needed, you can  minimize this performance hit.  Sessions and Caching  If a session is running, PHP may automatically add headers to prevent caching. These comprise a  Expires header dated in the past, Cache-Control: no-cache, and Pragma: no-cache. In other- wise static pages, where session data is not used, this is somewhat inconvenient.  This caching behavior can be controlled via the session.cache_limiter and session.cache_ expire settings, which control which cache control headers are sent, and when they expire.  Table 12-2 shows the four possible values for session.cache_limiter, along with the HTTP  headers that they cause to be sent  where xxx represents the value set in session.cache_expire .

So far, the focus of this chapter has primarily been on optimizing PHP as an application — best  practices for installing and confi guring how it interacts with the operating system. But this is only  half the story, and in the following section, you learn how careful programming of the language  itself also plays its part in performance.  EFFICIENT PHP PROGRAMMING  Thus far in this chapter, you have learned about server-level aspects of PHP performance —  extensions, compiling, and caching. Let’s now take a look at the language itself and ways in  which you can write more streamlined code.  Minor Optimizations  There are dozens of small ways in which you can make your PHP code more effi cient. But the gains  can be so small as to make them virtually insignifi cant, and the danger is that you end up focusing  on these trivial things rather than seeing the bigger picture.  For example, using single quotes is generally faster than using double quotes — the reason being  that variables inside double-quoted strings are expanded, so there is extra work involved in parsing  a double-quoted string. The gain is tiny, though — less than 1 percent.  Another trivial tip is that echo "foo", $bar, "baz" is faster than echo "foo" . $bar . "baz".  Again, the gain is less than 1 percent, making it almost pointless.  In some situations, echo is faster than print, but the gain is approximately 0.1 percent, and this  rule doesn’t even always hold true.  Major Optimizations  That’s not to say that all code optimization is pointless. There are plenty of things you can do that  make a signifi cant difference in speed, particularly when dealing with loops, because changes here  can have an impact on the speed of every iteration of the loops.  Loops  Following is a classic example seen a lot in the wild:  for  $i = 0; $i < count $x ; $i++  {     do something    }  The problem here is that count   is called for every iteration, and although the cost of an individual  count   is tiny, it can build up into something signifi cant for large arrays.  The solution is to call count before the loop, as shown here:  c12.indd   392 c12.indd   392  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Effi  cient PHP Programming  ❘  393  $y = count $x ; for  $i = 0; $i < $y; $i++  {     do something }  No doubt, the reason for the popularity of the fi rst method is that it looks cleaner and more concise.   And it eliminates the need to create a new variable.  But the second method is actually the most  effi cient.  NOTE  Incidentally, while and do-while loops are a little faster than for loops   approximately 25 percent faster, if benchmarks are to be believed .  Regular Expressions  Regular expressions  regexes  are costly, so it makes sense to avoid using them whenever possible.  For example, in many situations, str_replace is just as suitable as preg_replace.  Incidentally,  the PCRE regex functions — those beginning preg_* — are faster than the default POSIX regexes.   Regexes are often used for input validation, too  for example, to fi lter out any nonalphanumerics  from a string . But PHP already has some useful functions for doing this — ctype_alnum,  ctype_alpha and so on — and these are much more effi cient.  When you do need to use a regex, care must be taken. Although a little contrived, it’s not too dif- fi cult to come up with expressions that use exponentially more CPU time for each additional charac- ter in the matching string. Although regexes that take minutes or hours to run are extreme, it’s quite  easy to lose one-half a second or so on a complex regex simply through not writing it effi ciently.  Including Files  It’s common to see include fi les in PHP like so:   include "file.php";  However, this is not optimal for performance because it causes PHP to search the current directory  and each include path until file.php is found. Running strace shows what is going on:   cd  var www html  strace php -r 'include "foo.php";' ... lstat " var www html . foo.php", 0x7fff7d2b7680  = -1 ENOENT   No such file or directory  lstat " usr share php foo.php", 0x7fff7d2b7680  = -1 ENOENT   No such file or directory  lstat " usr share pear foo.php", {st_mode=S_IFREG0644, st_size=4, ...}  = 0  First, PHP looks in the current working directory, and then it searches the include paths. On the  third attempt, it fi nds foo.php under  usr share pear .  c12.indd   393 c12.indd   393  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   394  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  These extra lstats aren’t usually a killer, but they are unwanted  especially because disk I O is usu- ally a bottleneck , and will grow in number for every extra path in include_path. The solution is  to include path info in the include  . Even a relative path will work  useful for including fi les that  exist in the same directory , as shown here:  include " usr share pear foo.php"; include ". foo.php";  realpath  PHP 5.1 introduced the caching of paths in an attempt to alleviate this problem. The realpath  cache is a per-thread cache that stores the location in which an include fi le was found when abso- lute paths are not given.   Thus, in the fi rst include   example, when PHP fi nds foo.php in  usr share pear foo.php, it  caches this information. Subsequent attempts to include "foo.php" will then automatically use  usr  share pear foo.php, rather than causing PHP to search each directory listed in include_path   NOTE  However, the cache is not used if PHP is running in safe mode, or with  open_basedir restrictions.  The cache is stored in memory and is only a fi nite size — by default, 16 KB. This is usually too small  for large amounts of code, but it can easily be changed via the realpath_cache_size ini setting,  as shown here:  realpath_cache_size=64K  To best judge how big the cache should be, PHP provides two functions that allow you to view the  size and contents of the cache:  var_dump  realpath_cache_size    ; var_dump  realpath_cache_get    ;  Note that because the cache is held in memory, it isn’t persistent across PHP processes. If you run  PHP as an Apache module, each Apache thread has its own private realpath cache, which persists  for the lifetime of the thread  as defi ned through MaxRequestsPerChild, unless there are too many  spare child processes . If you run PHP as FastCGI, the cache is again private to each PHP thread.  Naturally, this weakens the effectiveness of the realpath cache, but it is still a welcome addition to  PHP.  If the cache is close to being full, you should probably look at increasing it. But keep in mind that  when PHP runs as an Apache module, there could be several hundred instances of the cache, which  could potentially add up to a lot of memory.  c12.indd   394 c12.indd   394  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Effi  cient PHP Programming  ❘  395  Another trick you can use to increase the effi ciency of the cache is to raise the TTL on entries. By  default, this is 120 seconds, which is low for a production server, where paths will rarely be chang- ing. Consider raising this to at least an hour in php.ini, as shown here:  realpath_cache_ttl=3600  Again, depending on how PHP runs, individual threads may not typically last long enough for there  to be any gain in raising the TTL further.  The drawback of the realpath cache  and of using a high TTL  is that PHP won’t see any changes  on the fi lesystem immediately. For example, if you move one of your include fi les to a new location,  PHP still looks for it in the old place and throws an error. This doesn’t tend to happen much on pro- duction servers, and restarting Apache or the FastCGI PHP threads can solve it. Alternatively, you  can call clearstatcache   to purge the cache — but remember, it clears only the cache of the PHP  thread on which it runs.  include versus require  A related subject is whether to use include   or require  , or even include_once   or require_ once  . The main differences are that require   throws a fatal error if the fi le cannot be found   while include   just generates a warning . include_once   and require_once   stop you from  accidentally including a fi le multiple times.   In terms of performance, there is no clear winner, and different benchmarks have shown contradic- tory results; although, you should expect the *_once functions to be a little slower. Certainly, any  real gain is tiny, and your choice should instead be governed by other factors  such as the way they  handle fi les that don’t exist .  Garbage Collection  In Chapter 6, “JavaScript, the Document Object Model, and Ajax,” you saw how JavaScript uses  garbage collection to reclaim unused memory. As with JavaScript, circular references can occur in  PHP, too, and PHP uses a very similar garbage collection method to combat the problem.  In PHP version 5.3 onward, by default, garbage collection only kicks in when the root table  basi- cally a list of all variables in existence  reaches a certain level — the default being 10,000 entries.   This threshold can be altered by modifying gc_root_buffer_max_entries in zend zend_gc.c in  the PHP source code, and then recompiling.  For small scripts, this means that garbage collection  may not run at all. But you can trigger it manually if you want by calling gc_collect_cycles  .  In the case of small scripts, this usually simply isn't necessary. For long-running  but small  scripts,  there may be some benefi t.  The downside to garbage collection is the additional CPU work involved. If garbage collection leads  to signifi cant freeing of memory, this overhead is worth it. But for smaller scripts, the memory gains  will be slim, and the extra CPU work often produces no overall benefi t.  c12.indd   395 c12.indd   395  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   396  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  Autoloading Classes  PHP version 5 introduced autoloading of classes, a feature whereby classes can be automatically  loaded as needed. The obvious benefi t is that it saves you from manually including each class at the  top of your code. For example, consider the following:  require_once "lib foo.php" ; require_once "lib bar.php" ; require_once "lib baz.php" ;  Rather that using this code, you can create an autoload function to carry out the leg work, as  shown here:  function __autoload $class  {     require_once "lib " . $class . ".php" ; }  Now, when you come to use the class, PHP will automatically load it  if it has not already been  loaded .  $x = new foo  ;  Is there any performance benefi t to using this method? Potentially, there is. By only loading classes  at the point at which a new instance is created, you save the overhead of loading classes that poten- tially aren’t used in your code. Many developers are guilty of simply copying and pasting in a block  of include require statements, without stopping to think if each class is actually needed in this  particular script.  Persistent MySQL Connections  The various PHP MySQL extensions offer the capability to create persistent connections to the  database server. With persistent connections, when a script fi nishes executing, the connection  to the database is not automatically closed, but remains open in a pool. Subsequent processes  can then reuse these already open connections.  In theory, this sounds great, because it should eliminate the overhead and latency involved in open- ing and closing connections. In practice, however, the gains are actually rather slim.   When connecting to a MySQL instance running on the same machine as the web server, a UNIX  socket is normally used rather than a TCP connection. In this situation, the overhead is tiny anyway,  and the benefi t of persistent connections is negligible.  With a preforking Apache server, the pool of persistent connections is local to each process. If a new  process is forked, it starts with an empty pool. Thus, in many cases, the benefi ts of persistent con- nections cannot be realized.   Finally, using persistent connections involves extra self-discipline. You must remember to remove  any temporary tables, unlock any locked tables, unset session variables, and so on — activities that  would normally be handled automatically when the connection was closed.  c12.indd   396 c12.indd   396  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Effi  cient PHP Programming  ❘  397  Overall, there tends to be little practical advantage to using persistent connections.  Caching HTML Output  There are many ways to perform caching of content — through HTTP headers, reverse proxies, or  caching modules in the web server. Yet another option is to perform caching of dynamically gener- ated content by using PHP.  This method isn’t as effi cient as, say, one of Apache’s caching modules  which can serve up a  resource directly from the cache, without the need to evoke PHP . But it is a lot more fl exible. You  can cache whole pages or just fragments, set different cache periods on different resources, and so on.   Let’s look at a quick example that illustrates how you might implement your basic caching  mechanism:  print " Users Currently Online "; $r1 = mysql_query "SELECT username, id FROM users where online=1" ; while  $res = mysql_fetch_array $r1   {     print " ";     print $res['username'];     print "  "; }  This code simply pulls a list of online users from the database and prints them in a list  along with a  link to each user’s profi le .   Does this information need to be generated on each page load? It probably does not. In many cases,  it is quite acceptable for it to be a few minutes stale. So, you can generate the list, cache it, and then   for the next few minutes anyway  serve subsequent requests from the cache, as shown here:  print " Users Currently Online ";  $maxage = 300;  Cache for 5 minutes  if  filemtime ". cache online.txt"  <  time   - $maxage   {  $r1 = mysql_query "SELECT username, id FROM users where online=1" ; while  $res = mysql_fetch_array $r1   {     $users_html .= " ";     $users_html .= $res['username'];     $users_html .= "  "; } file_put_contents ". cache online.txt", $users_html ;  } else {     $users_html = file_get_contents ". cache online.txt" ; }  In this example, the cached HTML fragment is stored in . cache online.txt. First, you check the last  modifi ed time of the fi le. If it is longer than 5 minutes ago, you query MySQL and then write the data to  the fi le. Otherwise, you load the contents of the fi le directly into the $users_htm l string.  c12.indd   397 c12.indd   397  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   398  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  There are a few problems with this method. Although you’ve eliminated the MySQL query  and a  little bit of work concatenating strings , you now must read and write a fi le, and query its last modi- fi ed time. With a relatively lightweight SQL query, the benefi ts will probably be slim  especially  if the nature of the query means that it will likely be served from the MySQL query cache . But  for heavy SQL queries — or computationally expensive PHP code — the benefi ts are greater, and  increasingly outweigh the overhead of the fi le operations.  Of course, you can also do some of this work outside of PHP via a cron job. For example, you could  use a stand-alone PHP script that fetches the list of online users every 5 minutes and then writes it to  a fi le. The PHP code in the web page can then just read the contents of this fi le, without needing to  check its mtime, saving a little bit of overhead.  As you’ve already seen, APC allows the programmer to cache variables, so another option is to store  your HTML fragments in APC, cutting out the need to read from a fi le on disk. This method isn’t  practical for large fragments, however.  Another downside to the example previously given is that it doesn’t perform any sort of fi le locking.  If one PHP process attempts to read the fi le as another is writing to it, or two processes attempt to  write at the same time, things will get messy. Things are starting to get more complicated, but rather  than re-inventing the wheel, there are a number of PEAR and PECL modules for performing such  caching.  A favorite is Cache_Lite  available through PEAR  designed to be small and fast, and to handle  high levels of concurrency  via fi le locking . The result is a module that is easy to use and takes the  pain out of manually implementing caching. Check out the PEAR website for more details.  Even armed with a handful of tips on which features of the PHP language have the potential to be  ineffi cient, your code can still sometimes run surprisingly slow. A crude way to diagnose such  problems is by scattering your code with calls to microtime   to determine which blocks are  taking the longest to run. Fortunately, there are much more powerful means of fi nding bottlenecks.  In the following section, you learn about xhprof, a popular profi ling tool that can show exactly  where your code is spending its time.  PROFILING WITH XHPROF  xhprof is a function-level profi ler developed by Facebook and available through PECL. It provides  a detailed breakdown of the memory usage and CPU times for each function call, allowing you to  see where your code is spending most of its time. This section briefl y describes installation and then  shows xhprof in action.  Installing  As of this writing, automatic installation via pecl was broken, but installation is still easy enough:  pecl download channel:  pecl.php.net xhprof-0.9.2 tar -zxvf xhprof-0.9.2.tgz cd xhprof-0.9.2 extension phpize  c12.indd   398 c12.indd   398  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Proﬁ ling with xhprof  ❘  399  . configure make make install  A Simple Example  You can then load the xhprof.so extension in the usual way. The xhprof package also contains  two directories: xhprof_lib and xhprof_html. Place these in your web root.  Earlier in this chapter, you learned how ineffi cient the following is because it causes count   to be  called for each iteration of the loop:  for  $i = 0; $i < count $x ; $i++  {  Let’s use xhprof to confi rm this.  <?php $x = array  ; for  $i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++  {  $x[$i] = $i; } xhprof_enable XHPROF_FLAGS_CPU + XHPROF_FLAGS_MEMORY ;  $y = 0; for  $i = 0; $i <= count $x ; $i++  {    $y++;     }  $xhprof_data = xhprof_disable  ;  $XHPROF_ROOT = " var www xhprof"; include_once $XHPROF_ROOT . " xhprof_lib utils xhprof_lib.php"; include_once $XHPROF_ROOT . " xhprof_lib utils xhprof_runs.php";  $xhprof_runs = new XHProfRuns_Default  ; $run_id = $xhprof_runs->save_run $xhprof_data, "xhprof_testing" ; echo "Done, go here:  xhprof xhprof_html index.php?run={$run_id}"  . "&source=xhprof_testing\n"; ?>  In this example, you create an array with 100,000 items. Then you enable xhprof and ask it to  track CPU and memory usage. Next, you include the code you want to profi le, iterating through the  array. Finally, you disable xhprof  you’re fi nished with profi ling , and save the details.  Heading over to the URL outputted, you can view the report, as shown in Figure 12-2. The table  confi rms the suspicions — 100,003 calls were made to count  , and the whole block of code took  136 microseconds to run.  c12.indd   399 c12.indd   399  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   400  ❘  CHAPTER 12  OPTIMIZING PHP  FIGURE 12-2  Let’s try rewriting the loop:  $count = count $x ; for  $i = 0; $i <= $count; $i++  { }  Figure 12-3 shows the output.  FIGURE 12-3  Although memory usage is pretty much the same, the number of function calls has dropped  as you  would expect , and overall execution time is down to approximately 4 microseconds — a signifi cant  improvement. Of course, it’s not often you need to iterate through an array of 100,000 elements, so  this is a somewhat artifi cial example. But it illustrates how useful xhprof can be in diagnosing these  sorts of problems.  c12.indd   400 c12.indd   400  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   Summary  ❘  401  Don’t Use PHP  One of the best ways to improve the performance of PHP is not to use it. Even a lean, highly opti- mized PHP page takes more memory and CPU, and takes longer to serve than a static HTML fi le.  Creating a new page and automatically giving it the .php extension is something that many develop- ers are guilty of, but it’s worth taking a step back and thinking whether.html might not be more  appropriate. Will you actually be using any PHP scripting in the page?  Even for pages that do need PHP, the content is still often fairly static. You might use it to include a  common footer, header, and navigation menu, or to pull some paragraphs of text from the database.  In these situations, the content is the same each time  except for when you manually update the  include fi les or database , and having PHP execute the same code on each page load is unnecessary.  Pages with only modest PHP usually can benefi t a lot by being generated offl ine as pure HTML  documents. Consider a site that uses PHP solely to include a common header and footer. Rather than  publish these PHP fi les, you can execute them at the command line, piping the output to an .html  fi le. Providing you take care to ensure that the links use the correct extensions, the static version  of the site functions identically to the PHP version, but is faster. Of course, if you edit your header  footer templates, you must rebuild these static pages. But if the whole process is scripted, then this is  a minor inconvenience.  With a bit of thought, you can extend this logic to more complicated sites. Given how popular it is  to offer personalized content to logged-in users, the opportunities to pregenerate the whole page are  becoming increasingly rare. But you can still often pregenerate parts.   For example, if the homepage of a site shows a list of currently logged-in users, this information  rarely needs to be 100 percent accurate. You can cut out some PHP and database work by using a  cron to execute the code for fetching the list of logged-in users, dumping it to a fi le, and then including  this via PHP  or writing it directly to your homepage template . The possibilities here are endless.  SUMMARY  Server-side, an opcode cache, is virtually essential and is usually the single most important thing  that can be done to improve PHP performance. Sessions can also hurt performance and should be  used only when necessary.  Removing unnecessary modules from PHP can dramatically reduce its memory footprint, allowing  greater levels of concurrency, whereas compiling PHP from a source can also reap many rewards —  not least of which is the ability to compile specifi cally for your processor type.  It’s easy to get bogged down in debates on whether echo   is faster than print  , but, in practice,  many “tips” like this have only a tiny effect on speed. Instead, you should concentrate on areas in  which the biggest gains are to be made. Regular expressions are a common problem, as are loops   because any ineffi ciency inside the loop is multiplied by the number of iterations of the loop . Profi ling  with a tool like xhprof can be an excellent way to discover where the bottlenecks are in a script.  No matter how effi cient your PHP code, it will always be several orders of magnitude more expensive  than serving up static HTML documents. Many simple sites can be built as static HTML documents,  using a scripting language like PHP to construct the pages in advance.   c12.indd   401 c12.indd   401  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   c12.indd   402 c12.indd   402  05 11 12   4:54 PM 05 11 12   4:54 PM   PART III Appendixes    cid:2  APPENDIX A: TCP Performance    cid:2  APPENDIX B: Designing for Mobile Platforms    cid:2  APPENDIX C: Compression  bapp01.indd   403 bapp01.indd   403  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   bapp01.indd   404 bapp01.indd   404  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   A  TCP Performance  A good knowledge of the TCP IP protocol suite is essential to gain full understanding of  network performance. Although a full examination of this suite is a bit outside the scope of  this book, this appendix briefl y reviews the transmission control protocol  TCP  from the  perspective of the three-way handshake, interpreting the output of netstat, and a couple of  techniques that you can use to improve TCP performance.   This is not a defi nitive guide — whole books have been written on the subject — but it should  hopefully serve as a starting point for those wanting to learn more.  THE THREE-WAY HANDSHAKE  When reviewing waterfall views of web browsers that are loading sites, you can see how, for  many resources, there is a delay during which the client establishes a TCP connection to the  web server.  This doesn’t happen for all resource requests because connections that are already  open are reused if both sides support KeepAlive.

TCP is a reliable, connection-based proto- col, and before data can fl ow, a connection must be established. This is done by means of the  three-way handshake.   bapp01.indd   405 bapp01.indd   405  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   406  ❘  APPENDIX A   TCP PERFORMANCE  A lot happens during this handshake — for example, timestamps and  sequence numbers are set  so that if packets arrive in the wrong order,  they can be re-assembled correctly . However, all you actually need to  know is that this is a three-step process, as shown in Figure A-2:   1.  The client sends a packet with the synchronization  SYN  fl ag set.   2.  The server responds with a synchronization acknowledgment     3.  The client responds by sending its own acknowledgment    SYN-ACK .   ACK .  SYN-ACK  SYN  ACK  The connection is now established, and data can fl ow. For HTTP, this  means a request can be issued.   FIGURE A-2  On the Internet  which uses the Internet Protocol, or IP, as the underlying delivery method , each  packet has a 40-byte overhead — 20 bytes for IP  at least for IPv4 — eventually the Internet will  switch to the new IPv6  and 20 bytes for TCP. The packets have no payload, so their size is small.  As such, bandwidth isn’t usually a factor in the time it takes to perform the handshake.   However, latency is a factor. If the latency between the client and server is one-half a second, it will  be 1.5 seconds before the connection has been established and a HTTP request can be issued. If  the HTTP resource requested is small, the overhead of opening the TCP connection can easily be  greater than the time spent requesting and receiving the resource  especially if a DNS lookup must  be performed . For that reason, it isn’t always wise to trick the browser into opening up lots of con- nections  for example, by hosting resources on multiple subdomains .  Aside from network latency, another consideration is the time it takes the operating system on both  the client and server to process and respond to the packets in the three-way handshake. Almost  always, any delays occur on the server side. The reason is that the server is typically processing  a high volume of packets  possibly hundreds per second , and each of these requires a little bit of  RAM and CPU time.   To avoid swamping the network with connection requests, the network stack of the operating sys- tem typically queues requests. When viewing waterfall graphs for your site, if you see large delays  in connections established  and also the time to fi rst byte, or TTFB , check your server’s network  latency  using a tool like ping . Also, if it is swamped with connections, the netstat tool is useful  for checking latency.   Some operating systems, such as Linux, are highly confi gurable in how the network stack behaves.  But the defaults are usually good, and you need to exercise care if you decide to adjust them — it  could make matters a lot worse.

For example, SYN_RECV indicates that a SYN has  been received as part of the three-way handshake. TIME_WAIT indicates a connection is in the pro- cess of being shut down. Consult the netstat man pages for a complete list of socket status.  When a TCP connection has been established, ACK fl ags are still used — this time to acknowledge  receipt of packets from the other party. For example, if a web server returns a resource to a client,  the resource will likely be split across several packets.  The maximum size of a TCP packet is 64 KB,  but the underlying layers also impose restrictions — Ethernet, for example, sets a maximum size of  1,500 bytes.    For each packet that the client receives, it sends an acknowledgment  ACK  back to the server. This is  part of what makes TCP a reliable protocol. If an ACK isn’t received within a certain amount of time,  the sender assumes that the packet is lost and resends it.  If the sender waited for each packet to be acknowledged before it sent the next one, things would  move slowly. Instead, sending windows are used. These defi ne the maximum amount of data that  the sender is willing to send without receiving an ACK from the recipient. When this limit is reached,  the sender will hold off sending any more until some of the data has been acknowledged.   This is great for overcoming the effects of latency. In many cases, the sender can just keep pumping  out data, knowing  at least hoping  that the recipient will eventually acknowledge. This does cause  problems on unreliable networks, though, because there’s a greater chance of packet loss, and a  greater chance that the sender must retransmit some  or all  of the data.  bapp01.indd   407 bapp01.indd   407  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   408  ❘  APPENDIX A   TCP PERFORMANCE  The network stack of the operating system defi nes a default size for this sending window, but it can  also be renegotiated during the TCP session. For example, if the server sends out data faster than the  client can acknowledge it, the client can ask for the window to be reduced.  TCP PERFORMANCE  Nagle’s Algorithm  You can improve TCP performance in many ways. Let’s take a quick look at a couple of the most  common.  As mentioned, each TCP packet  fl owing over an IP network  has a 40-byte header. If the payload  of the packet is small, this overhead can be signifi cant. The classic example is a telnet session. Each  time the user presses a key, a packet is sent to the server. The payload of the packet is tiny, but it still  has the 40-byte overhead. Now, imagine that the user can type fi ve characters per second. That’s  200 bytes per second of overhead, and just a few bytes per second of actual data.   In the 1980s, John Nagle was the fi rst person to document this problem, and his solution was that  the sender should wait for the other party to acknowledge the data before it sent any more. In effect,  this gives the sender a chance to buffer data fi rst, resulting in a larger payload and a lower percent- age of overhead. Using Nagle’s algorithm, if there are no packets waiting to be acknowledged, new  data will be sent immediately. If there are packets waiting to be acknowledged, new data will be  buffered by the sender until either earlier data has been acknowledged, or the maximum packet size  is reached.  This is great for saving bandwidth, but it increases latency. It is actually counter-productive to over- all performance on web servers. Some web servers provide a means to alleviate this performance  problem.  For example, Nginx provides an option  tcp_nodelay  you can use to disable the Nagle  algorithm if wanted.  TCP_NOPUSH and TCP_CORK  On Linux, the TCP_CORK option achieves a similar result as the Nagle algorithm. It buffers partial  frames  for up to a maximum of 200 milliseconds  before sending them out, giving the operating  system a chance to group them together. Again, this cuts down on bandwidth  because of less header  overhead , at the expense of an increase in latency. FreeBSD offers a similar option, TCP_NOPUSH,  but this has been plagued by bugs in the past.  You’ll sometimes encounter server applications that allow TCP_NOPUSH TCP_CORK to be enabled or  disabled. tcp_nopush in Nginx is a prime example. With Nginx, the effect will be to attempt to  send the entire HTTP response inside a single packet if this is enabled.   In general, TCP_NOPUSH TCP_CORK should not be enabled if your want to reduce latency as much as  possible.  bapp01.indd   408 bapp01.indd   408  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   B  Designing for Mobile Platforms  For a long time, desktop PCs accounted for the vast majority of the traffi c that a typical  website was likely to receive. It was relatively safe to simply ignore mobile users — they  made up a tiny percentage of the market and accepted that most sites would not display  correctly on their devices. All this is changing, though, and the mobile users currently make  up  approximately 8 percent of the market — a fi gure that is rising every year. The days when  mobile users were a minority who could be ignored are long gone.  In this appendix, you learn about a variety of methods for detecting mobile devices and  serving up custom content to them. In this way, you can ensure that users on devices with  lower bandwidth or smaller screens still experience a fast, usable interface.  UNDERSTANDING MOBILE PLATFORMS  It’s worth defi ning exactly what is meant by mobile platforms. Once upon a time, it was easy  to distinguish these platforms. Cell phones had a screen of approximately 2 inches, whereas  PCs had a screen of approximately 15 or 17 inches. However, today, a huge range of devices  fall somewhere in between — laptops, netbooks, tablets, smartphones, PDAs — all with  varying screen sizes, and  perhaps just as important  different resolutions. Simply designing  a mobile version of your site for users who have a cell phone with a 2-inch display fails to  accommodate those with, say, a netbook with a 7-inch display.   bapp02.indd   409 bapp02.indd   409  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   410  ❘  APPENDIX B   DESIGNING FOR MOBILE PLATFORMS  Table B-1 shows some of the most common mobile platforms, along with their screen sizes and dis- play resolution s .

These  devices are often connected over higher-latency networks, and many service providers charge by  the gigabyte. Not only should you accommodate lower screen resolutions, but you should also aim  to reduce the size of resources. For example, this means that simply scaling down an image via the  width and height img attributes to fi t mobile devices isn’t a good idea — opt instead to serve a  low-resolution version of the image.   In the next section, learn about a variety of methods to achieve this, including the use of JavaScript,  server-side detection, and CSS3.  RESPONSIVE CONTENT  Responsive content  of which responsive images are a subset  is a somewhat fancy term for a  technique that you may already use to some degree — delivering different content to different users  based on characteristics of their display capabilities. Technically, this could probably apply to things  like gzip content compression  because it is based on whether the client advertises support , but it  almost always  refers to differentiating mobile users from desktop users, and feeding them  appropriate content.   A number of techniques have been developed for this, but not all are completely satisfactory.  Usually, a combination of techniques produces the best results. Let’s take a look at some of the most  popular.  bapp02.indd   410 bapp02.indd   410  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   Responsive Content  ❘  411  Getting Browser Display Capabilities with JavaScript  Using JavaScript, you can obtain the browser’s resolution and color depth — a good starting point  to decide on the image dimensions resolutions to use. You can then use this information to rewrite  the URLs in image tags.   In the following code, if the screen resolution is 400 pixels or less in either direction, you iterate  through each image tag and prepend  small  to the beginning of the URL. Then you simply must  make smaller versions of each image and place them in the  small directory. The technique could  be expanded to give more fi ne-grained control than simply using normal or small — perhaps one  set of images for smartphones and another for tablets.  if   screen.width<=400    screen.height<=400   {     var images = document.getElementsByTagName 'img' ;     for  var i=0;i<images.length;i++ {         images[i].src = ' small ' . images[i].src;     } }  This code must be executed before the browser begins downloading images from the page, so it  must go in the document head, and be executed when a DOM ready event fi res. Even then, modern  browsers are now so aggressive at fetching content  which is usually a good thing  that you can’t  guarantee that this code will execute before images start being requested. In a worst-case scenario,  the browser might end up requesting both the small and normal copies of an image, which defeats the  purpose to reduce data transfer. Of course, this technique also relies on the browser supporting  JavaScript.  In this example, the normal-sized images are used by default  in the img tags . What if you start  by assuming small and then upgrading to large if the screen resolution is above a certain size? This  way, mobile browsers still get the smaller images even if they don’t support JavaScript. You still  inconvenience desktop users who have no JavaScript support.  They’ll just see the small images.   But the percentage of desktop PC browsers not supporting JavaScript  or with JavaScript disabled   should be a lot lower than the percentage of mobile devices with no JavaScript.   Finally, it would be only desktop PC users who were affected by the possibility of two copies of the  image being requested — and generally they are on faster connections.  Server-Side Detection of Capabilities  Rather than relying on JavaScript, you could also attempt to perform client detection on the server —  for example, by looking at the UserAgent string in requests. You might reference your image like so:     Then, in logo.php, you can add some logic to read the UserAgent and send the appropriate image.  You could either maintain several copies of the image at different dimensions resolutions, or resize  the image on-the-fl y  for example, via GD .   Both methods have their pros and cons. It’s tedious to generate and maintain multiple copies of an  image, but this method does provide the best control. For example, you may decide that a combination  of cropping and resizing works best on small screens. Resizing on-the-fl y is the easiest solution but is  much more CPU-intensive.  bapp02.indd   411 bapp02.indd   411  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   412  ❘  APPENDIX B   DESIGNING FOR MOBILE PLATFORMS  Either way, there are two additional downsides to this method:   ➤ Using PHP introduces additional overhead. Usually, you’d want to serve images from a   lightweight, static fi le server.   ➤ Returning different content from an identical URL could potentially cause serious caching   problems. Imagine two clients on the same Internet Service Provider  ISP , behind a  transparent, caching proxy provided by the ISP. Client A, which uses a smartphone,  requests an image. Your code spots the smartphone and returns a low-resolution version  of the image. The response is cached by the ISP’s proxy. When Client B, a regular user of  a desktop PC, later requests the image, the ISP’s proxy sees that it already has the resource  cached, and returns this instead. The desktop user sees an image intended only for  smartphones. This all happens because the two URLs are identical.  Sending a 3xx redirect error to the appropriate resource is one way to combat the second problem.  But be careful of browsers caching the redirect, and remember that this will incur the penalty of an  extra HTTP request.  Server-side detection also has the drawback of being less reliable than client-side detection. Using  JavaScript, you can accurately obtain the user’s display resolution. With a server-side solution, you  must make assumptions based on the UserAgent. To do this, you must build a basic database that  maps UserAgent to the appropriate capabilities — not a particularly appealing task, given the range  of devices out there.   Luckily, help is at hand. WURFL  http:  wurfl.sourceforge.net  is an AGPL-licensed XML fi le  containing the UserAgents and capabilities of thousands of mobile devices. Using the PHP API sup- plied with it, you can easily query the screen resolution of a given client, as shown here:  include_once '. inc wurfl_config_standard.php'; $requestingDevice = $wurflManager->getDeviceForHttpRequest $_SERVER ; Resolution Width:  getCapability       'resolution_width' ; ?>   Resolution Height:  getCapability       'resolution_height' ; ?>   A Combined Approach  Neither the client-side nor server-side approach is perfect. The client-side approach relies on  JavaScript being present and causes potential race conditions.  Can JavaScript update the path in the  img tags before the browser begins fetching them?  The server-side approach interferes with caching,  is less reliable, and causes higher server load.   However, you can combine the two approaches to create an effective compromise. The logic goes  like this:   1.  On the initial page request, JavaScript is used on the client side to set a cookie containing   the client’s screen resolution.    2.     3.   Because this cookie will be sent only for subsequent requests, you use WURFL  or similar   to perform server-side detection if the cookie isn’t present. This detection could be carried  out in either your PHP code or via mod_rewrite.  If the cookie is present, you send out an HTML document containing appropriate image  tags  for example, src=" images tablet logo.png" .  bapp02.indd   412 bapp02.indd   412  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   Responsive Content  ❘  413  With this approach, you use only server-side detection for the initial page request, before the  JavaScript has had a chance to return a  hopefully  more accurate response. And because you rewrite  the image tags in the back-end scripting language before sending the HTML document to the client,  you don’t need to worry about caching problems.  CSS3 Media Queries  Most front-end developers are familiar with the CSS2 feature that allows different style sheets to  be used for different media types  for example, one style sheet to use when displaying the document  in a browser, and another to use when printing the document . CSS3 takes this one step further  with the introduction of media queries — individual rules  or groups of rules  that only take effect  under particular conditions. In the following example, the font size will be set at 80% if the display is  600px or less in width:   @media screen and  max-width: 600px  {   .myclass {     font-size:80%;   } }  Of course, this is only the tip of the iceberg, and a lot more is possible with more complex CSS rules.  A common use for media queries is to hide side bars or extra columns for low-resolution displays.  You can even use media queries inside   tags to selectively load entire style sheets.   In following example, a different style sheet is used, depending on whether the display is aligned in  portrait or landscape mode, something that can easily be changed on many mobile devices:  <link rel="stylesheet" media="all and  orientation:portrait "       href="portrait.css">  <link rel="stylesheet" media="all and  orientation:landscape "       href="landscape.css">  Determining Connection Speed  Screen size is only one factor in the equation, and it could be argued that connection speed is equally  important. This applies to users of desktop PCs with dial-up connections, too. But how do you  determine the user’s connection speed? You could look for strings like ppp or dialup in the client’s  hostname — these are usually reliable indicators of a client on a dial-up modem. But then it’s not  safe to assume that the lack of such strings in the hostname means that the client has a fast  connection — even broadband users can be hampered by high latency and low bandwidth.   The most reliable way to determine the client’s latency and bandwidth is to measure it directly — by  timing how long it takes the client to retrieve a fi le — and even this is far from perfect. If the fi le is  too big, you waste the user’s bandwidth. If the fi le is too small, the results can be inaccurate.   This is also one of those techniques that is not good for the initial page request. A bandwidth test  like this would need to run in the background after the initial page had been loaded. By that stage,  most of the static resources should already be in the browser’s cache, making the results of the test  pointless. So, although serving different content for those on a slow connection is an admirable goal,  it’s not a realistic one at the moment.  bapp02.indd   413 bapp02.indd   413  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   414  ❘  APPENDIX B   DESIGNING FOR MOBILE PLATFORMS  JAVASCRIPT AND CSS COMPATIBILITY  It’s tempting to think that mobile browsers are divided into two categories: those that support JavaScript,  and those that don’t. The truth is less appealing. Most mobile browsers do support JavaScript, but  to varying degrees. Inconsistencies can even be present between identical browsers on different  platforms  in the same way that Internet Explorer on a Mac can behave differently than Internet  Explorer on a Windows machine .   The same is also true of CSS. For example, Opera Mobile on a Nokia E66 supports font-size: 150%.  Opera Mobile on an HTC Touch Diamond doesn’t. It’s a compatibility minefi eld and is  reminiscent of the state of desktop web browsers in the late 1990s. The best advice is to keep things  as simple as possible.  The ever-useful quirksmode.org has a compatibility table  http:  www.quirksmode.org  m table.html  for both JavaScript and CSS, illustrating some of the differences. Be aware,  though, that this page dates from 2010, and the landscape is changing fast. At the least it illustrates  how subtle the differences between devices can be.  CACHING IN MOBILE DEVICES  The topic of how mobile browsers cache content is a minefi eld. Not only does it vary from browser  to browser, it can also change signifi cantly between the same browser running on different  platforms, and even different versions of the same platform.  It has been widely documented that Safari on early versions of the iPhone would not cache   individual resources bigger than 25 KB and had an overall cache size of approximately 500 KB to  1,000 KB. That was in 2008, and things have changed since then. However, the overall message is  still the same. You can’t rely on a mobile browser to cache large resources, and the cache is only a  fi nite size. This is something often forgotten when working with desktop browsers, which generally  have large caches.  Internet Explorer 9, for example, uses a maximum cache size of 250 MB.  With  a cache size measured in kilobytes, there’s a good chance that your resources will have been kicked  out to make way for fresher content.  The situation is better in the iPhone 4, which now has a 100 MB browser cache  much bigger than  other mobile devices, incidentally . There’s a “but,” though. This is an in-memory cache, so it does  not persist across device reboots, or even browser restarts. This isn’t quite as bad as it sounds.  Although it’s common for desktop users to close their browsers when they’ve fi nished, the behavior  on iPhone tends to be to keep the browser process running in the background, but minimized. So,  browser restarts on an iPhone don’t happen as frequently as you might fi rst think.  The same lack of persistence is present in iPads too, but the situation is better in Android  both  smartphone and tablet  and Blackberry devices. They generally have a persistent cache equal to the  size of the memory cache.  bapp02.indd   414 bapp02.indd   414  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   Caching in Mobile Devices  ❘  415  Although mobile devices are often guilty of not caching enough, the opposite appears to be true for  the iPhone 5, with developers fi nding that POST requests are often being cached by default.  They  should not be cached, unless explicitly permitted via an Expires or Cache-Control header.   What is the lesson you learn from all this? Don’t rely on a mobile device to perform caching. If you  have a bulky website but shrug your shoulders and think it doesn’t matter because your far-future  Expires headers will mean there is only a performance hit on the fi rst page load, think again. You  should probably design the mobile version of your site under the assumption that no caching will  take place  and that any caching that does occur is a bonus .  bapp02.indd   415 bapp02.indd   415  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   bapp02.indd   416 bapp02.indd   416  05 11 12   5:04 PM 05 11 12   5:04 PM   C  Compression  Compression has been a recurring theme in this book, for image formats  such as GIF and  PNG , command-line compression tools  such as bzip2 and gzip , and HTTP compression  through gzip and deflate. Despite this diversity in how compression is used, the majority of  implementations actually employ the same underlying algorithms. This appendix provides a  brief examination of the most common compression methods.  THE LZW FAMILY  LZ77  The origins of the widely used LZW family of compression algorithms have their roots in two  papers written by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and 1978. These papers defi ned the  LZ77 and LZ78 algorithms, two contrasting approaches to achieve compression by spotting  repeating patterns.   LZ77 looks for patterns of repeating data in previously seen input and replaces the data with  a reference to the fi rst instance of the pattern. The reference takes the form of a length-offset  pair, indicating the length of the pattern, and it’s offset  from the current position . Consider  the following stream of data:  The second instance of ABCD can be replaced with a length-offset pair, like so:  ABCDEFXYZABCD  ABCDEFXYZ 4,9   Here, the number 4 indicates the length of the pattern, and the number 9 indicates the offset   nine characters back from the current position .  bapp03.indd   417 bapp03.indd   417  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   418  ❘  APPENDIX C   COMPRESSION  Sliding Window  In many cases, it would be impractical for LZ77 to search the whole stream of previous data for  matches. It could potentially be hundreds of megabytes, and the CPU and memory overhead would  be huge.   Instead, a sliding window is used, with LZ77 searching only the most recently seen data. The size  of this window varies from implementation to implementation, but is generally measured in kilo- bytes — deflate, for example, uses a 32 KB window. A larger window means a greater opportunity  for LZ77 to fi nd matches in previously seen data. However, it also increases the CPU and memory  usage — and, hence, also the time — for compressing and uncompressing.  Although LZ77 is easy to implement, the compression levels achieved are generally rather  mediocre — partly because of the limited size of the sliding history window. You can sometimes take  advantage of the knowledge that LZ77 will search back only so far for matches. For example, in some  situations, you can re-arrange data in your CSS or JavaScript fi les so that similar strings of text appear  close together. Even so, LZ77 compression isn’t brilliant, and it is most often combined with entropy  encoding algorithms such as Huffman  which you will learn more about later in this appendix .  Performance  LZ78  LZ78 works in a similar way to LZ77, replacing multiple occurrences of patterns. However, whereas  LZ77 uses a length-offset pair, LZ78 uses a dictionary. The dictionary is dynamically created based  on the input data.   For example, consider the following example data:  ABCDEFXYZABCD  Table C-1 shows what a basic dictionary might look like.  Dictionary entries are stored in reverse  order, but this has been ignored here for simplicity.   TABLE C-1:  Sample Dictionary  INDEX  DICTIONARY ENTRY  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  A  B  C  D  E  F  X  bapp03.indd   418 bapp03.indd   418  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   The LZW Family  ❘  419  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  Y  Z  AB  BC  CD  DE  EF  FX  XY  ZA  ABC  BCD  Repeating strings are replaced with a two-part codeword giving the index of the matching string  and the fi rst nonmatching symbol to occur after the string. Thus, the example string could be  converted to the following:   24,E  20,Z  17,D   This is somewhat of an oversimplifi cation because a complete dictionary hasn’t been constructed,  but it shows the general principles involved. The main performance concern with LZ78 is the size of  the dictionary because it could potentially grow to take up all available memory.  Even for this small  test string, the number of ways in which it can be tokenized is large.    All LZ78 implementations limit the size of the dictionary in some way — either by freezing it when  it reaches a certain size, removing the least recently used entries, or even erasing it completely. The  UNIX tool compress adopts the latter approach and erases the dictionary if it detects that the com- pression level has dropped below a certain ratio.  The assumption is that the dictionary entries must  be poor.  Also, because longer tokens  which are the most wanted  appear later in the dictionary,  they are more likely to have been excluded because of lack of space.  Doesn’t a large dictionary vastly increase the size of the compressed data, eliminating any saving  from the compression? Actually, it does not. One of the cool features of LZ78 is that the dictionary  does not need to be sent in the header of the compressed data — the dictionary can be reconstructed  simply by analyzing the compressed stream.   LZW  In 1984, Terry Welch published a paper describing an enhanced version of the LZ78 algorithm  named LZW. Among the changes, LZW uses a more rigid dictionary format. The fi rst 256 entries  are used for the standard ASCII table, with the remaining entries populated dynamically with   bapp03.indd   419 bapp03.indd   419  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   420  ❘  APPENDIX C   COMPRESSION  strings appearing in the data. LZW uses 12-bit codes, giving a maximum of 4,096 dictionary  entries. As with LZ77, because the dictionary is  mostly  populated dynamically, the compression  ratio tends to start off poorly, but increases as more and more data is compressed, with typical com- pression levels for text of approximately 50 percent.  LZW was the fi rst LZ-derivative to be widely used.  The UNIX compress tool is a notable exam- ple.  But it also became famous for less positive reasons, including its licensing restrictions.  Although LZ77 and LZ88 were license-free, LZW had been patented in 1983  the holding company  eventually becoming Unisys , a fact unknown to CompuServ when it created the GIF image format   which is built around LZW  in 1987. Unisys became aware of this patent infringement in 1993 and  began negotiations for licensing. In fairness, the licensing fees were modes, and only applied to big  companies — end web developers were not affected. But there was a huge public outcry, and the  search was on for a license-free alternative. The result was PNG.   Although the patents on LZW expired several years ago, the likes of LZ77 plus Huffman encoding   which you will learn more about shortly  provide better levels of compression. As a result, there is  little impetus to use LZW any longer.  NOTE   Incidentally, the US patent on GIF expired in 2003  in other countries it  was 2004 , so the GIF format is now completely free to use.  LZ Derivatives  Various other dictionary-based encoding schemes exist, based on the original LZ77 and LZ88  papers. Although none of these are as omnipresent as LZW, let’s take a brief look at a few of them.  Lempel-Ziv-Markov Chain Algorithm  LZMA   Based on LZ77, LZMA uses a much bigger dictionary  up to 4 GB , along with a range encoder to  keep its size down, and generally offers good compression levels. It is used in 7-Zip  7z .  Statistical LZ  Statistical LZ is based on LZ78 but uses statistical analysis to determine the most appropriate  that  is, most frequently occurring  data to store in the dictionary. This keeps the size of the dictionary  down, resulting in faster decompression with lower CPU and memory usage. The fl ip side is that  compression takes longer. But this often isn’t a concern, and the overall compression ratio is  generally better than other LZ derivatives.   Statistical LZ has found a use in compressing ringtones on cell phones — a situation in which  compression speed is not important, but compression ratio and decompression speed are.  Lempel-Ziv Ross Williams  LZRW    The LZRW subfamily of LZ77 variants focuses on increasing compression speed by placing tokens  in a hash table. Referencing this table is faster than specifying a length-offset pair. The LZRW  families were published during the early 1990s — a time when memory and CPU were a fraction of   bapp03.indd   420 bapp03.indd   420  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   Huff man Encoding  ❘  421  what is standard today — and LZRW concentrates on effi cient use of resources, rather than optimal  compression.   These days, the situation has reversed. Memory and CPU are generally plentiful, and higher com- pression is wanted. As a result, the LZRW family is no longer in common usage, except in specialist,  low-resource situations.  Although the LZ family offers reasonable levels of compression, the most popular implementa- tions combine it with some form of entropy encoding  that is, assigning codes to symbols  to fur- ther increase the compression ratio. As you learn in the next section, the most commonly used is  Huffman encoding, which traces its roots back to a paper published in 1952 by David Huffman.  HUFFMAN ENCODING  The basic idea behind Huffman encoding is to encode the input data, replacing it with a series of  symbols. At fi rst, this may sound rather like LZ88, but the implementation is quite different. Rather  than using a dictionary, Huffman encoding uses a binary tree that is constructed by analyzing the  input data. The tree is arranged so that more frequently used characters are higher up the tree, and,  hence, can be referenced by a shorter symbol.  The fi rst step, therefore, is to order the characters in the input by frequency. Consider the following  example stream:  ABCDEFXYZABABCABDECA  The frequency of each character is as shown in Table C-2.  TABLE C-2:  Character Frequency  CHARACTER  FREQUENCY  A  B  C  D  E  F  X  Y  Z  5  4  3  2  2  1  1  1  1  bapp03.indd   421 bapp03.indd   421  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   422  ❘  APPENDIX C   COMPRESSION  A priority queue is then created, with the least frequently  occurring characters placed fi rst, as shown in Figure C-1. For  clarity,  the frequency is shown above each character.  1  Z  1  Y  1  X  1  F  2  2  3  4  E D C B  5  A  To see how the binary tree is constructed, you start at the left  and create two child nodes from the fi rst two characters in the  queue, as shown in Figure C-2. In the parent node  which would otherwise be empty , you see the  new priority.  FIGURE C-1  This tree fragment is then reinserted into the queue. Its priority is the sum of the priority  frequency   of the two characters that it comprises, as shown in Figure C-3.  1  X  1  F  2  2  3  4  E D C B  5  A  2  Z  Y  FIGURE C-2  1  X  2  2  3  4  2  E D C B  5  A  1  F  Z  Y  FIGURE C-3  The process is then repeated for the next two leftmost elements, resulting in the structure shown in  Figure C-4.  These two nodes are joined together  their parent now having a priority of 4 , and are re-inserted  into the queue, as shown in Figure C-5.  E D C B  A  2  2  3  E D C  4  4  B  5  A  2  2  2  2  Z  Y  X  F  Z  Y  X  F  FIGURE C-4  FIGURE C-5  The process continues until the fi nal two items in the queue have been joined, at which point you  end up with a complete tree, as shown in Figure C-6.  bapp03.indd   422 bapp03.indd   422  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   Huff man Encoding  ❘  423  Because each node of the tree has at most two descendants, you can reference any node of the tree as  a series of zeros and ones, describing the path that must be taken  starting from the top of the tree   to reach the desired nodes. Figure C-7 illustrates this  with the frequency counts removed because  they don’t play a fi nal part in the tree .  12  8  7  4  B  4  C  2  20  A  2  E  D  Z  Y  X  F  FIGURE C-6  0  1  C  0  0  1  0  0  1  A  0  1  1  0  1  B  1  1  0  E  D  Z  Y  X  F  FIGURE C-7  By convention, 0 means follow the branch to the left, and 1 means follow the branch to the right.  Thus, the character “E” could be represented by the sequence 0000 and the character “A” by the  sequence 01. The original string could thus be encoded as follows:  01110010001000010111010100110000111011100101110001000000101  Although this seems a lot longer than the original string, remember that you’re dealing with binary  data here. Although this example has used characters of the alphabet for simplicity, the binary rep- resentation of the unencoded string would actually be longer. With 8 bits used for a single character,  it would be 160 bits long. Compared with the 49 bits for the encoded version, this is a signifi cant  savings.   bapp03.indd   423 bapp03.indd   423  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   424  ❘  APPENDIX C   COMPRESSION  This savings occurs for two reasons:   ➤ The tree is structured so that more frequently occurring characters can be referenced by a  shorter path  at the expense of less frequently accessed characters represented by a longer  path .   ➤ In this example, the entropy is fairly low — only eight unique characters occur in the input   data.  If the input data contained all the characters of the ASCII set  256 , using a fi xed  or randomly gen- erated  binary tree to represent the data wouldn’t offer any savings. The real power occurs because  the tree is optimized and contains characters that actually appear only in the input stream.  Incidentally, you may be wondering how a decoder knows that  in this example  01 represents “A”?  Couldn’t 01 be the start of the path for another character? In this binary stream, how does the  decoder know where one path sequence ends and another starts?   As it turns out, another property of the binary tree is that such ambiguities simply can’t occur. In  Figure C-7, you can see that no other path begins 01. The same is true for every other sequence.  Each character occurs at the end of a branch and has no children below it.  Decoding, therefore, is simple and just involves walking the tree. Unlike LZ78  where the dictionary  structure can be deduced from the compressed data , the binary tree cannot be dynamically con- structed by the decoder and must be included in the header of the compressed data. This adds some  slight overhead, but unless the encoded data is small, it is minimal enough not to be a problem.   COMPRESSION IMPLEMENTATIONS  Huffman encoding and the LZ family are by far the most popular compression methods in use.  Of  course, this discussion does not address lossy compression methods such as JPEG because they con- stitute a whole different story.  To conclude this discussion, let’s look at some of the most commonly  used Huffman and LZ implementations. Knowing the underlying compression methods used by  these implementations is helpful to understand how best to optimize them.  deflate was originally created for PKZIP but is now a staple of the open source world. It uses  LZ77  with a 32 KB sliding window  followed by Huffman encoding, supporting either static or  dynamically created Huffman binary trees. Details of which tree method to use are stored in a  header block.   PKZIP also introduced an enhanced version, deflate64, which uses a 64 KB sliding window. This  leads to slightly higher levels of compression but is not in widespread use because of its proprietary  nature. The main implementations are PKZIP and 7-Zip  which is part of the reason why 7-Zip gen- erally offers slightly better compression than its competitors .  You’ll most commonly encounter the standard  32 KB window  deflate in gzip, zlib, PKZIP, and  7-Zip.   deflate is an algorithm. zlib is a commonly used C library that implements this algorithm. gzip is  an end application that uses zlib. So, gzip implements deflate compression via the zlib library.  It’s also worth noting that data compressed with deflate will not be identical to data compressed   bapp03.indd   424 bapp03.indd   424  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   Compression Implementations  ❘  425  with gzip. The gzip format defi nes a header  consisting of a timestamp, version number, and other  optional fi elds  and a footer  containing a CRC32 checksum and the length of the original, uncom- pressed data  sandwiching the deflated body. Thus, gzip can simply be thought of as “deflate  with headers and checksums.”  Confusion between the differences of deflate and gzip is one of the reasons why some web brows- ers had trouble coping with compressed HTTP content in the past — they either expected gzip  headers in a deflate stream or failed to realize headers would exist in a gzip stream. Naturally,  purely deflated content results in the smallest overall size, but the headers added by gzip are still  fairly modest and can be useful for integrity checking.  As previously mentioned, the zlib library is ubiquitous and forms the heart of PNG compression, via  libpng. zlib also crops up in rsync, OpenSSH, and even the Linux kernel.  NOTE   In case you’re wondering, bzip2  “the other” UNIX compression tool   uses the Burrows-Wheeler Transform  BWT , which is a different technique but  does generally offer better compression than gzip zlib deflate.   bapp03.indd   425 bapp03.indd   425  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   bapp03.indd   426 bapp03.indd   426  05 11 12   5:05 PM 05 11 12   5:05 PM   INDEX  Symbols and Numbers ""  quotation marks , HTML   attributes, 64–65  ?  question mark , placeholders,   ALTER TABLE, 247, 273 Alternative PHP Cache  APC , 375,   381–388  Amazon, 47, 117, 310, 355 ANALYZE TABLE, 247 Animated Portable Network   ^  carrot , regular expressions, 126 $  dollar sign , regular expressions,   Graphics   APNG , 109  253  126  3xx, 412 301, 33–34 302 Found, 34 303 See Other, 34  A Accept-Encoding, 41, 42, 44, 45 access logs, 146 ACK, 368, 407 ACLs.
