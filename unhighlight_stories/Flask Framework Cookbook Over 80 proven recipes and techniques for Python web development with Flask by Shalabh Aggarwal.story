See	also  Other	Books	You	May	Enjoy  Leave	a	review	-	let	other	readers	know	what	you	think   Preface  In	the	five	years	since	the	first	edition	of	this	book	was	published,	I	have received	numerous	emails,	letters,	and	feedback	messages	from	readers appreciating	or	criticizing	the	book,	and	suggesting	how	it	could	be	improved and	updated.	The	technology	itself	has	changed	quite	a	bit	in	the	meantime: Python	3	has	taken	the	mainstream	and	Python	2	is	on	the	path	to	being	phased out.	Flask	released	their	first	major	version,	version	1.0,	in	April	2018.	Many libraries	and	packages	became	obsolete	or	unmaintained,	while	new	libraries	and packages	evolved	as	substitutes	or	accessories.	Alongside	all	this,	a	huge	shift took	place	in	application	deployment	and	management	architecture	design,	with scalability	being	the	foremost	concern.  For	first-time	readers,	Flask	is	a	lightweight	web	application	microframework written	in	Python.	It	makes	use	of	the	flexibility	of	Python	to	provide	a	relatively simple	template	for	web	application	development.	Flask	makes	it	possible	to write	simple	one-page	applications,	but	it	also	has	the	power	to	scale	them	and build	larger	applications	without	any	issues.  Flask	has	excellent	documentation	and	an	active	community.	It	has	a	number	of extensions,	each	of	which	have	documentation	that	can	be	rated	from	good	to excellent.	There	are	a	few	books	available	on	Flask;	they	are	great	and	provide	a lot	of	insight	into	the	framework	and	its	applications.	This	book	tries	to	take	a different	approach	to	explain	the	Flask	framework	and	multiple	aspects	of	its practical	uses	and	applications	as	a	whole.  This	book	takes	you	through	a	number	of	recipes	that	will	help	you	understand the	power	of	Flask	and	its	extensions.	You	will	start	by	exploring	the	different configurations	that	a	Flask	application	can	make	use	of.	From	here,	you	will learn	how	to	work	with	templates,	before	learning	about	the	ORM	and	view layers,	which	act	as	the	foundation	of	web	applications.	Then,	you	will	learn how	to	write	RESTful	APIs	with	Flask,	after	learning	various	authentication techniques.	As	you	move	ahead,	you	will	learn	how	to	write	an	admin	interface, followed	by	debugging	and	logging	errors	in	Flask.	You	will	also	learn	how	to make	your	applications	multilingual	and	gain	an	insight	into	the	various	testing   techniques.	You	will	learn	about	the	different	deployment	and	post-deployment techniques	on	platforms	such	as	Apache,	Tornado,	Heroku,	and	AWS	Elastic Beanstalk.	Finally,	as	an	addition	to	this	book's	second	edition,	you	will	learn about	popular	microservices	tools	such	as	Docker,	Kubernetes,	and	AWS Lambda	that	can	be	used	to	build	highly	scalable	services.  By	the	end	of	this	book,	you	will	have	all	the	information	required	to	make	the best	use	of	this	incredible	microframework	to	write	small	and	big	applications and	scale	them	with	industry-standard	practices.  A	good	amount	of	research	coupled	with	years	of	experience	have	been	used	to develop	this	book,	and	I	really	hope	that	this	book	will	benefit	fellow developers.   Who	this	book	is	for  If	you	are	a	web	developer	who	wants	to	learn	more	about	developing applications	in	Flask	and	scaling	them	with	industry-standard	practices,	this	is the	book	for	you.	This	book	will	also	act	as	a	handy	tool	if	you	are	already	aware of	Flask's	major	extensions	and	want	to	make	the	best	use	of	them.	It	is	assumed that	you	have	knowledge	of	Python	and	a	basic	understanding	of	Flask.	   What	this	book	covers  Chapter	1,	Flask	Configurations,	explains	the	different	ways	in	which	Flask	can be	configured	to	suit	the	various	needs	of	any	project.	It	starts	by	telling	us	how to	set	up	our	development	environment	and	moves	on	to	the	various configuration	techniques.  Chapter	2,	Templating	with	Jinja2,	covers	the	basics	of	Jinja2	templating	from	the perspective	of	Flask	and	explains	how	to	make	applications	with	modular	and extensible	templates.  Chapter	3,	Data	Modeling	in	Flask,	deals	with	one	of	the	most	important	parts	of any	application,	that	is,	its	interaction	with	database	systems.	We	will	see	how Flask	can	connect	to	database	systems,	define	models,	and	query	databases	for the	retrieval	and	feeding	of	data.  Chapter	4,	Working	with	Views,	talks	about	how	to	interact	with	web	requests	and the	proper	responses	to	these	requests.	It	covers	various	methods	of	handling requests	properly	and	designing	them	in	the	best	way.  Chapter	5,	Webforms	with	WTForms,	covers	form	handling,	which	is	an	important part	of	any	web	application.	As	much	as	the	forms	are	important,	their	validation holds	equal	importance,	if	not	more.	Presenting	this	information	to	the	users	in an	interactive	fashion	adds	a	lot	of	value	to	the	application.  Chapter	6,	Authenticating	in	Flask,	deals	with	authentication,	which	sometimes acts	as	a	thin	red	line	between	the	application	being	secure	and	insecure.	This chapter	deals	with	multiple	social	and	enterprise	login	techniques	in	detail.  Chapter	7,	RESTful	API	Building,	explains	REST	as	a	protocol	and	then	discusses writing	RESTful	APIs	for	Flask	applications	using	libraries,	as	well	as completely	customized	APIs.  Chapter	8,	Admin	Interface	for	Flask	Apps,	focuses	on	writing	admin	views	for Flask	applications.	First,	we	write	completely	custom-made	views	and	then	write them	with	the	help	of	an	extension.   Chapter	9,	Internationalization	and	Localization,	expands	the	scope	of	Flask applications	and	covers	the	basics	of	how	to	enable	support	for	multiple languages.  Chapter	10,	Debugging,	Error	Handling,	and	Testing,	moves	on	from	being completely	development-oriented	to	testing	our	application.	With	better	error handling	and	tests,	the	robustness	of	the	application	increases	manifold,	and debugging	makes	the	lives	of	developers	easier.  Chapter	11,	Deployment	and	Post-Deployment,	covers	the	various	ways	and	tools with	which	the	application	can	be	deployed.	Then,	you	will	learn	about application	monitoring,	which	helps	us	to	keep	track	of	the	performance	of	the application.  Chapter	12,	Microservices	and	Containers,	talks	about	building	and	deploying applications	in	a	microservices	pattern	using	tools	such	as	Docker,	Kubernetes, and	AWS	Lambda.  Chapter	13,	Other	Tips	and	Tricks,	is	a	collection	of	some	handy	tricks	that	range from	full-text	search	to	caching.	Then,	finally,	we	will	go	asynchronous	with certain	tasks	in	Flask	applications.   To	get	the	most	out	of	this	book  In	most	cases,	you	will	just	need	a	computer	system	with	an	average configuration	to	run	the	code	in	this	book.	Usually,	any	OS	will	do,	but	Linux and	macOS	are	preferred	over	Windows.  It	is	assumed	that	you	have	some	knowledge	of	Python.

Flask	Configurations  This	introductory	chapter	will	help	us	to	understand	the	different	ways	Flask	can be	configured	to	suit	various	needs	as	per	the	demands	of	the	project.  "Flask	is	a	microframework	for	Python	based	on	Werkzeug,	Jinja	2,	and	good	intentions." 																																																																																								-	Flask	official	documentation  So,	why	a	microframework?	Does	this	mean	Flask	lacks	functionality,	or	that	it's mandatory	your	complete	web	application	goes	inside	one	file?	Not	really!	The microframework	simply	refers	to	the	fact	that	Flask	aims	to	keep	the	core	of	its framework	small	but	highly	extensible.	This	makes	writing	applications	or extensions	both	easy	and	flexible,	and	gives	developers	the	power	to	choose	the configurations	they	want	for	their	application	without	imposing	any	restrictions on	the	choice	of	database,	templating	engine,	and	so	on.	In	this	chapter,	you	will learn	a	number	of	ways	to	set	up	and	configure	Flask.  This	whole	book	uses	Python	3	as	the	default	version	of	Python.	Python	2	loses	its	support	on December	31st,	2019,	and	is	therefore	not	supported	in	this	book.	It	is	recommended	that readers	use	Python	3	while	learning	from	this	book,	as	many	of	the	recipes	might	not	work	on Python	2.  Getting	started	with	Flask	takes	just	a	couple	of	minutes.	Setting	up	a	simple Hello	World	application	is	as	easy	as	pie.	Simply	create	a	filename,	such as	app.py—in	any	location	on	your	computer	that	can	access	python—that	contains the	following	script:  from	flask	import	Flask	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 	 @app.route ' ' 	 def	hello_world  :	 				return	'Hello	to	the	World	of	Flask!'	 	 if	__name__	==	'__main__':	 				app.run  	  Now,	Flask	needs	to	be	installed;	this	can	be	done	via	pip	or	pip3.	You	may	have to	use	sudo	on	a	Unix-based	machine	if	you	run	into	access	issues:  				$	pip3	install	Flask   The	preceding	snippet	is	a	complete	Flask-based	web	application.	Here,	an instance	of	the	imported	Flask	class	is	a	Web	Server	Gateway	Interface  WSGI 	 http:  legacy.python.org dev peps pep-0333  	application.	So,	app	in	this	code becomes	our	WSGI	application,	and	as	this	is	a	standalone	module;	we	set	the __name__	string	as	'__main__'.	If	we	save	this	in	a	file	with	the	name	app.py,	then	the application	can	simply	be	run	using	the	following	command:  				$	python3	app.py 				*	Running	on	http:  127.0.0.1:5000   Now,	if	we	head	over	to	our	browser	and	type	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 ,	we	can	see our	application	running.  Alternatively,	the	application	can	also	be	run	by	using	flask	run	or	by	using Python's	-m	switch	with	Flask.	While	following	this	approach,	the	last	two	lines of	app.py	can	be	skipped.	Note	that	the	following	commands	work	only	if	there	is a	file	named	app.py	or	wsgi.py	in	the	current	directory.	If	not,	then	the	file containing	the	app	object	should	be	exported	as	an	environment	variable,	such as	FLASK_APP.	As	a	best	practice,	this	should	be	done	in	either	case:  				$	export	FLASK_APP=app.py 				$	flask	run 				*	Running	on	http:  127.0.0.1:5000   Alternatively,	if	you	decide	to	use	the	-m	switch,	it	will	look	as	follows:  				$	export	FLASK_APP=app.py 				$	python3	-m	flask	run 				*	Running	on	http:  127.0.0.1:5000   Never	save	your	application	file	as	flask.py;	if	you	do,	it	will	conflict	with	Flask	itself	while importing.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Setting	up	our	environment	with	virtualenv Handling	basic	configurations Configuring	class-based	settings Organizing	static	files Being	deployment-specific	with	instance	folders Compositions	of	views	and	models Creating	a	modular	web	app	with	Blueprints Making	a	Flask	app	installable	using	setuptools   Setting	up	our	environment	with virtualenv  Flask	can	be	simply	installed	using	pip pip3	or	easy_install	globally,	but	it's preferable	to	set	up	an	application	environment	using	virtualenv.	This	prevents the	global	Python	installation	from	being	affected	by	a	custom	installation,	as	it creates	a	separate	environment	for	the	application.	This	separate	environment	is helpful	as	it	allows	you	to	have	multiple	versions	of	the	same	library	used	for multiple	applications;	some	packages	might	also	have	different	versions	of	the same	libraries	as	dependencies.	virtualenv	manages	this	in	separate	environments and	does	not	let	the	incorrect	version	of	any	library	affect	any	application.	In	this recipe,	we	will	learn	about	how	to	create	and	manage	these	environments.   How	to	do	it...  First,	install	virtualenv	using	pip3	and	then	create	a	new	environment	with	the name	my_flask_env	inside	the	folder	in	which	we	ran	the	first	command.	This	will create	a	new	folder	with	the	same	name,	as	follows:  Run	the	following	commands	from	inside	the	my_flask_env	folder:  				$	pip3	install	virtualenv 				$	virtualenv	my_flask_env 		  				$	cd	my_flask_env 				$	source	bin activate 				$	pip3	install	flask  This	will	activate	our	environment	and	install	Flask	inside	it.	Now,	we	can	do anything	with	our	application	within	this	environment,	without	affecting	any other	Python	environment.   How	it	works...  So	far,	we	have	used	pip3	install	flask	multiple	times.	As	the	name	suggests,	the command	refers	to	the	installation	of	Flask,	just	like	any	Python	package.	If	we look	a	bit	deeper	into	the	process	of	installing	Flask	via	pip3,	we	will	see	that	a number	of	packages	are	installed.	The	following	is	an	outline	of	the	package installation	process	of	Flask:  				$	pip3	install	-U	flask 				Downloading unpacking	flask 				........... 				........... 				Many	more	lines......... 				........... 				Successfully	installed	flask	Werkzeug	Jinja2	itsdangerous 				markupsafe	click 				Cleaning	up... 		  In	the	preceding	command,	-U	refers	to	an	installation	with	upgrades.	This	will	overwrite	any existing	installation	with	the	latest	released	versions.  If	we	look	carefully	at	the	preceding	snippet,	we	will	see	that	there	are	six packages	installed	in	total;	namely,	flask,	Werkzeug,	Jinja2,	click,	itsdangerous,	and markupsafe.	These	are	the	packages	on	which	Flask	depends,	and	it	will	not	work	if any	of	them	are	missing.   There's	more...  To	make	our	lives	easier,	we	can	use	virtualenvwrapper,	which,	as	the	name suggests,	is	a	wrapper	written	over	virtualenv	and	makes	the	handling	of	multiple instances	of	virtualenv	easier.  Remember	that	the	installation	of	virtualenvwrapper	should	be	done	on	a	global level.	So,	deactivate	any	virtualenv	that	might	still	be	active.	To	deactivate,	use the	following	command:  $	deactivate  It	is	also	possible	that	you	might	not	be	able	to	install	the	package	on	a	global	level	because of	permission	issues.	Switch	to	superuser	or	use	sudo	if	this	occurs.  Install	virtualenvwrapper	using	the	following	commands:  $	pip3	install	virtualenvwrapper $	export	WORKON_HOME=~ workspace $	source	 usr local bin virtualenvwrapper.sh  In	the	preceding	code,	we	installed	virtualenvwrapper,	created	a	new	environment variable	with	the	name	WORKON_HOME,	and	provided	it	with	a	path,	which	will	act	as the	home	for	all	virtual	environments	created	using	virtualenvwrapper.  To	create	a	virtualenv	and	install	Flask,	use	the	following	commands:  $	mkvirtualenv	my_flask_env $	pip3	install	flask  $	deactivate  To	deactivate	a	virtualenv,	simply	run	the	following	command:  To	activate	an	existing	virtualenv	using	virtualenvwrapper,	run	the	following command:  	$	workon	my_flask_env  Remember	that	all	the	commands	used	with	virtualenv	are	also	available	with	virtualenvwrapper. Commands	such	as	mkvirtualenv	and	workon	are	quick	alternatives	that	make	life	a	bit	easier.   See	also  The	references	and	installation	links	relating	to	this	section	are	as	follows:  https:  pypi.python.org pypi virtualenv  https:  pypi.python.org pypi virtualenvwrapper  https:  pypi.python.org pypi Flask  https:  pypi.python.org pypi Werkzeug  https:  pypi.python.org pypi Jinja2  https:  pypi.python.org pypi itsdangerous  https:  pypi.python.org pypi MarkupSafe  https:  pypi.python.org pypi click   Handling	basic	configurations  When	we	configure	a	Flask	application,	we're	able	to	do	so	as	per	the	need.	So, in	this	recipe,	we	will	try	to	understand	the	different	ways	in	which	Flask	can	be configured,	including	how	to	load	a	configuration	from	environment	variables, Python	files,	or	even	a	config	object.   Getting	ready  In	Flask,	a	configuration	is	done	on	an	attribute	named	config	of	the	Flask	object. The	config	attribute	is	a	subclass	of	a	dictionary,	and	we	can	modify	it	just	like any	dictionary.   How	to	do	it...  To	run	our	application	in	the	debug	mode,	for	instance,	we	can	write	the following:  app	=	Flask __name__ 	 app.config['DEBUG']	=	True	 The	debug	Boolean	can	also	be	set	at	the	Flask	object	level	rather	than	at	the	config	level,	as follows: app.debug	=	True Alternatively,	we	can	pass	debug	as	a	named	argument	to	app.run,	as	follows: app.run debug=True  In	new	versions	of	Flask,	the	debug	mode	can	also	set	on	an	environment variable,	FLASK_DEBUG=1,	and	then	run	the	app	using	flask	run	or	Python's	-m	switch: $	export	FLASK_DEBUG=1 Enabling	the	debug	mode	will	make	the	server	reload	itself	in	the	event	of	any	code	changes, and	it	also	provides	the	very	helpful	Werkzeug	debugger	when	something	goes	wrong.  There	are	a	bunch	of	configuration	values	provided	by	Flask.	We	will	come across	them	in	relevant	recipes	throughout	this	chapter.  As	an	application	grows	larger,	there	is	a	need	to	manage	the	application's configuration	in	a	separate	file,	as	shown	in	the	following	example.	Mostly specific	to	machine-based	setups,	it	is	unlikely	that	this	will	be	a	part	of	the version-control	system.	For	this,	Flask	provides	us	with	multiple	ways	to	fetch configurations.	The	most	frequently	used	methods	are	as	follows:  From	a	Python	configuration	file	 *.cfg ,	the	configuration	can	be	fetched using	the	following	command:  app.config.from_pyfile 'myconfig.cfg' 	  From	an	object,	the	configuration	can	be	fetched	using	the	following command:  app.config.from_object 'myapplication.default_settings' 	  Alternatively,	to	load	from	the	same	file	from	which	this	command	is	run, we	can	also	use	the	following	command:  app.config.from_object __name__    From	the	environment	variable,	the	configuration	can	be	fetched	using	the following	command:  app.config.from_envvar 'PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE' 	   How	it	works...  Flask	is	intelligent	enough	to	pick	up	only	configuration	variables	that	are written	in	uppercase.	This	allows	us	to	define	any	local	variables	in	our configuration	files	and	objects	and	leave	the	rest	to	Flask.  The	best	practice	when	using	configurations	is	to	have	a	bunch	of	default settings	in	app.py,	or	via	any	object	in	the	application	itself,	and	to	then	override the	same	by	loading	it	from	the	configuration	file.	So,	the	code	will	look	as follows:  app	=	Flask __name__ 	 DEBUG	=	True	 TESTING	=	True	 app.config.from_object __name__ 	 app.config.from_pyfile ' path to config file' 	   Configuring	using	class-based	settings  An	interesting	way	of	laying	out	configurations	for	different	deployment	modes, such	as	production,	testing,	staging,	and	so	on,	can	be	cleanly	done	using	the inheritance	pattern	of	classes.	As	your	project	gets	bigger,	you	can	have	different deployment	modes,	such	as	development,	staging,	production,	and	so	on,	where each	mode	can	have	several	different	configuration	settings,	or	some	settings that	will	remain	the	same.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	learn	how	to	use	class-based settings	to	achieve	such	a	pattern.   How	to	do	it...  We	can	have	a	default	setting	base	class,	and	other	classes	can	inherit	that	base class	and	override	or	add	deployment-specific	configuration	variables	to	it,	as shown	in	the	following	example:  class	BaseConfig object :	 				'Base	config	class'	 				SECRET_KEY	=	'A	random	secret	key'	 				DEBUG	=	True	 				TESTING	=	False	 				NEW_CONFIG_VARIABLE	=	'my	value'	 	 class	ProductionConfig BaseConfig :	 				'Production	specific	config'	 				DEBUG	=	False	 				SECRET_KEY	=	open ' path to secret file' .read  	 	 class	StagingConfig BaseConfig :	 				'Staging	specific	config'	 				DEBUG	=	True	 	 class	DevelopmentConfig BaseConfig :	 				'Development	environment	specific	config'	 				DEBUG	=	True	 				TESTING	=	True	 	 				SECRET_KEY	=	'Another	random	secret	key'	  The	secret	key	is	stored	in	a	separate	file	because,	for	security	reasons,	it	should	not	be	a	part of	your	version-control	system.	This	should	be	kept	in	the	local	filesystem	on	the	machine itself,	whether	it	is	your	personal	machine	or	a	server.   How	it	works...  Now	we	can	use	any	of	the	preceding	classes	while	loading	the	application's configuration	via	from_object  .	Let's	say	that	we	save	the	preceding	class-based configuration	in	a	file	named	configuration.py,	as	follows:  app.config.from_object 'configuration.DevelopmentConfig' 	  Overall,	this	makes	the	management	of	configurations	for	different	deployment environments	more	flexible	and	easy.   Organizing	static	files  Organizing	static	files	such	as	JavaScript,	stylesheets,	images,	and	so	on efficiently	is	always	a	matter	of	concern	for	all	web	frameworks.	In	this	recipe, we'll	learn	how	to	achieve	this	in	Flask.   Flask	recommends	a	specific	way	of	organizing	static	files	in	an	application,	as follows:  How	to	do	it...  my_app 	 				-	app.py	 				-	config.py	 				-	__init__.py	 				-	static 	 							-	css 	 								-	js 	 								-	images 	 												-	logo.png	  While	rendering	this	in	templates	 say,	the	logo.png	file ,	we	can	refer	to	the	static files	using	the	following	code:   	   How	it	works...  If	a	folder	named	static	exists	at	the	application's	root	level,	that	is,	at	the	same level	as	app.py,	then	Flask	will	automatically	read	the	contents	of	the	folder without	any	extra	configuration.   There's	more...  Alternatively,	we	can	provide	a	parameter	named	static_folder	to	the	application object	while	defining	the	application	in	app.py,	as	follows:  app	=	Flask __name__,	static_folder=' path to static folder' 	  In	the	preceding	line	of	code,	static	refers	to	the	value	of	static_url_path	on	the application	object.	This	can	be	modified	as	follows:  app	=	Flask 	 				__name__,	static_url_path=' differentstatic',	 				static_folder=' path to static folder'	  	  Now,	to	render	the	static	file,	we	will	use	the	following	code:   	  It	is	always	a	good	practice	to	use	url_for	to	create	URLs	for	static	files	rather than	explicitly	defining	them,	as	follows:   	  We	will	see	more	of	this	in	the	upcoming	chapters.   Being	deployment-specific	with instance	folders  Flask	provides	yet	another	method	for	configuration,	where	we	can	efficiently manage	deployment-specific	parts.	Instance	folders	allow	us	to	segregate deployment-specific	files	from	our	version-controlled	application.	We	know	that configuration	files	can	be	separate	for	different	deployment	environments,	such as	development	and	production,	but	there	are	also	many	more	files,	such	as database	files,	session	files,	cache	files,	and	other	runtime	files.	In	this	recipe,	we will	create	an	instance	folder,	which	will	act	like	a	holder	bin	for	such	kinds	of files.   How	to	do	it...  my_app 	 				-	app.py	 				-	instance 	 								-	config.cfg	  By	default,	the	instance	folder	is	picked	up	from	the	application	automatically	if we	have	a	folder	named	instance	in	our	application	at	the	application	level,	as follows:  We	can	also	explicitly	define	the	absolute	path	of	the	instance	folder	using	the instance_path	parameter	on	our	application	object,	as	follows:  app	=	Flask 	 				__name__,	instance_path=' absolute path to instance folder'	  	  To	load	the	configuration	file	from	the	instance	folder,	we	will	use	the instance_relative_config	parameter	on	the	application	object,	as	follows:  app	=	Flask __name__,	instance_relative_config=True 	  This	tells	the	application	to	load	the	configuration	file	from	the	instance	folder. The	following	example	shows	how	this	will	work:  app	=	Flask 	 				__name__,	instance_path='path to instance folder',	 				instance_relative_config=True	  	 app.config.from_pyfile 'config.cfg',	silent=True 	   How	it	works...  In	the	preceding	code,	first,	the	instance	folder	is	loaded	from	the	given	path, and	then,	the	configuration	file	is	loaded	from	the	file	named	config.cfg	in	the given	instance	folder.	Here,	silent=True	is	optional	and	is	used	to	suppress	the error	if	config.cfg	is	not	found	in	the	instance	folder.	If	silent=True	is	not	given	and the	file	is	not	found,	then	the	application	will	fail,	giving	the	following	error:  			IOError:	[Errno	2]	Unable	to	load	configuration	file	 No	such	file	 			or	 			directory :	' absolute path to config file' 		  It	might	seem	that	loading	the	configuration	from	the	instance	folder	using instance_relative_config	is	redundant	work	and	could	be	moved	to	one	of	the	configuration methods	itself.	However,	the	beauty	of	this	process	lies	in	the	fact	that	the	instance	folder concept	is	completely	independent	of	configuration,	and	instance_relative_config	just complements	the	configuration	object.   Composition	of	views	and	models  As	our	application	grows	bigger,	we	might	want	to	structure	it	in	a	modular manner.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	do	this	by	restructuring	our	Hello	World application.   How	to	do	it...  First,	create	a	new	folder	in	the	application	and	move	all	files	inside	this	new folder.  Then,	create	__init__.py	in	the	folders,	which	are	to	be	used	as	modules.  After	that,	create	a	new	file	called	run.py	in	the	topmost	folder.	As	the	name implies,	this	file	will	be	used	to	run	the	application.  Finally,	create	separate	folders	to	act	as	modules.  Refer	to	the	following	file	structure	to	get	better	understanding:  flask_app 	 				-	run.py	 				-	my_app 	 								-	__init__.py	 								-	hello 	 												-	__init__.py	 												-	models.py	 												-	views.py	  from	my_app	import	app	 app.run debug=True 	  from	flask	import	Flask	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 	 import	my_app.hello.views	  Let's	see	how	each	of	the	preceding	files	will	look.  The	flask_app run.py	file	will	look	something	like	the	following	lines	of	code:  The	flask_app my_app __init__.py	file	will	look	something	like	the	following	lines	of code:  Next,	we	will	have	an	empty	file	just	to	make	the	enclosing	folder	a	Python package,	flask_app my_app hello __init__.py:  	No	content.	 	We	need	this	file	just	to	make	this	folder	a	python	module.	   The	models	file,	flask_app my_app hello models.py,	has	a	non-persistent	key-value store,	as	follows:  MESSAGES	=	{	 				'default':	'Hello	to	the	World	of	Flask!',	 }	  Finally,	the	following	is	the	views	file,	flask_app my_app hello views.py.	Here,	we fetch	the	message	corresponding	to	the	requested	key	and	can	also	create	or update	a	message:  from	my_app	import	app	 from	my_app.hello.models	import	MESSAGES	 	 @app.route ' ' 	 @app.route ' hello' 	 def	hello_world  :	 				return	MESSAGES['default']	 	 	 @app.route ' show  ' 	 def	get_message key :	 				return	MESSAGES.get key 	or	"%s	not	found!"	%	key	 	 	 @app.route ' add    ' 	 def	add_or_update_message key,	message :	 				MESSAGES[key]	=	message	 				return	"%s	Added Updated"	%	key	  Remember	that	the	preceding	code	is	nowhere	near	production-ready.	It	is	just	for demonstration	and	to	make	things	understandable	for	new	users	of	Flask.   How	it	works...  We	can	see	that	we	have	a	circular	import	between	my_app __init__.py	and my_app hello views.py,	where,	in	the	former,	we	import	views	from	the	latter,	and	in the	latter,	we	import	the	app	from	the	former.	Although	this	makes	the	two modules	dependent	on	each	other,	there	is	no	issue,	as	we	won't	be	using	views in	my_app __init__.py.	Note	that	it	is	best	to	import	the	views	at	the	bottom	of	the file	so	that	they	are	not	used.  In	this	recipe,	we	used	a	very	simple	non-persistent	in-memory	key-value	store for	the	demonstration	of	the	model	layout	structure.	It	is	true	that	we	could	have written	the	dictionary	for	the	MESSAGES	hash	map	in	views.py	itself,	but	it	is	best practice	to	keep	the	model	and	view	layers	separate.  So,	we	can	run	this	app	using	just	run.py,	as	follows:  				$	python	run.py 					*	Serving	Flask	app	"my_app"	 lazy	loading  					*	Environment:	production 							WARNING:	Do	not	use	the	development	server	in	a	production	 							environment. 							Use	a	production	WSGI	server	instead. 					*	Debug	mode:	on 					*	Running	on	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 	 Press	CTRL+C	to	quit  					*	Restarting	with	stat 					*	Debugger	is	active! 					*	Debugger	PIN:	111-111-111  Note	the	preceding	WARNING	in	the	block.	This	warning	occurs	because	we	did	not	specify	the application	environment,	and	by	default,	production	is	assumed.	To	run	the	application	in	the development	environment,	modify	the	file	run.py	to	the	following:	 from	my_app	import	app app.env="development" app.run debug=True  The	reloader	indicates	that	the	application	is	being	run	in	the	debug	mode,	and	the application	will	reload	whenever	a	change	is	made	in	the	code.  We	can	see	that	we	have	already	defined	a	default	message	in	MESSAGES.	We	can view	the	that	by	opening	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 show default.	To	add	a	new	message, we	can	type	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 add great Flask%20is%20greatgreat!!.	This	will update	the	MESSAGES	key-value	store	to	look	like	the	following:  MESSAGES	=	{	 				'default':	'Hello	to	the	World	of	Flask!',	 				'great':	'Flask	is	great!!',	 }	   Now,	if	we	open	the	link	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 show great	link	in	a	browser,	we	will see	our	message,	which	would	have	otherwise	appeared	as	a	not-found	message.   See	also  The	next	recipe,	Creating	a	modular	web	app	with	blueprints,	provides	a	much better	way	of	organizing	your	Flask	applications	and	is	a	ready-made	solution for	circular	imports.   Creating	a	modular	web	app	with blueprints A	blueprint	is	a	concept	in	Flask	that	helps	make	large	applications	really modular.	This	keeps	application	dispatching	simple	by	providing	a	central	place to	register	all	components	in	an	application.	A	blueprint	looks	like	an	application object	but	is	not	an	application.	It	also	looks	like	a	pluggable	app,	or	a	smaller part	of	a	bigger	app,	but	it	is	not.	A	blueprint	is	actually	a	set	of	operations	that can	be	registered	on	an	application	and	represents	how	to	construct	or	build	an application.   Getting	ready  In	this	recipe,	we'll	take	the	application	from	the	previous	recipe,	Composition	of views	and	models,	as	a	reference	and	modify	it	to	work	using	blueprints.   How	to	do	it...  The	following	is	an	example	of	a	simple	Hello	World	application	using	Blueprint. It	will	work	in	a	manner	similar	to	the	previous	recipe	but	is	much	more	modular and	extensible.  First,	we	will	start	with	the	following	flask_app my_app __init__.py	file:  from	flask	import	Flask	 from	my_app.hello.views	import	hello	 	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 app.register_blueprint hello 	  Next,	the	views	file,	my_app hello views.py,	which	should	look	as	follows:  from	flask	import	Blueprint	 from	my_app.hello.models	import	MESSAGES	 	 hello	=	Blueprint 'hello',	__name__ 	 	 	 @hello.route ' ' 	 @hello.route ' hello' 	 def	hello_world  :	 				return	MESSAGES['default']	 	 	 @hello.route ' show  ' 	 def	get_message key :	 				return	MESSAGES.get key 	or	"%s	not	found!"	%	key	 	 	 @hello.route ' add    ' 	 def	add_or_update_message key,	message :	 				MESSAGES[key]	=	message	 				return	"%s	Added Updated"	%	key	  We	have	now	defined	a	blueprint	in	the	flask_app my_app hello views.py	file.	We	no longer	need	the	application	object	anymore,	and	our	complete	routing	is	defined on	a	blueprint	named	hello.	Instead	of	@app.route,	we	use	@hello.route.	The	same blueprint	is	imported	into	flask_app my_app __init__.py	and	registered	on	the application	object.  We	can	create	any	number	of	blueprints	in	our	application	and	complete	most	of the	activities	that	we	would	usually	do,	such	as	providing	different	template paths	or	different	static	paths.	We	can	even	have	different	URL	prefixes	or subdomains	for	our	blueprints.   subdomains	for	our	blueprints.   How	it	works...  This	application	will	work	in	just	the	same	way	as	the	last	application.	The	only difference	is	in	the	way	the	code	is	organized.   See	also  The	previous	recipe,	Composition	of	views	and	models,	is	useful	for	further understanding	how	this	recipe	is	useful.   Making	a	Flask	app	installable	using setuptools  We	now	have	a	Flask	app,	but	how	do	we	install	it	like	any	Python	package?	It	is possible	that	another	application	might	depend	on	our	application,	or	that	our application	is	in	fact	an	extension	for	Flask	and	would	need	to	be	installed	in	a Python	environment	so	it	can	be	used	by	other	applications.	In	this	recipe,	we will	see	how	setuptools	can	be	used	to	create	an	installable	Python	package.   How	to	do	it...  Installing	a	Flask	app	can	be	very	easily	achieved	using	the	setuptools	Python library.	To	achieve	this,	create	a	file	called	setup.py	in	your	application's	folder and	configure	it	to	run	a	setup	script	for	the	application.	This	will	take	care	of any	dependencies,	descriptions,	loading	test	packages,	and	so	on.  The	following	is	an	example	of	a	simple	setup.py	script	for	the	Hello	World application:  ! usr bin env	python	 	-*-	coding:	UTF-8	-*-	 import	os	 from	setuptools	import	setup	 	 setup 	 				name	=	'my_app',	 				version='1.0',	 				license='GNU	General	Public	License	v3',	 				author='Shalabh	Aggarwal',	 				author_email='contact@shalabhaggarwal.com',	 				description='Hello	world	application	for	Flask',	 				packages=['my_app'],	 				platforms='any',	 				install_requires=[	 								'flask',	 				],	 				classifiers=[	 								'Development	Status	::	4	-	Beta',	 								'Environment	::	Web	Environment',	 								'Intended	Audience	::	Developers',	 								'License	::	OSI	Approved	::	GNU	General	Public	License	v3',	 								'Operating	System	::	OS	Independent',	 								'Programming	Language	::	Python',	 								'Topic	::	Internet	::	WWW HTTP	::	Dynamic	Content',	 								'Topic	::	Software	Development	::	Libraries	::	Python	Modules'	 				],	  	   How	it	works...  In	the	preceding	script,	most	of	the	configuration	is	self-explanatory.	The classifiers	are	used	when	the	application	is	made	available	on	PyPI.	These	will help	other	users	search	the	application	using	the	relevant	classifiers.  Now,	we	can	run	this	file	with	the	install	keyword,	as	follows:  $	python	setup.py	install  The	preceding	command	will	install	the	application	along	with	all	the dependencies	mentioned	in	install_requires,	that	is,	Flask	and	all	of	Flask's dependencies.	Now	the	app	can	be	used	just	like	any	Python	package	in	a	Python environment.   See	also  The	list	of	valid	trove	classifiers	can	be	found	at	https:  pypi.python.org pypi?%3Aacti on=list_classifiers.   Templating	with	Jinja2  This	chapter	will	cover	the	basics	of	Jinja2	templating	from	the	perspective	of Flask;	we	will	also	learn	how	to	make	applications	with	modular	and	extensible templates.  In	Flask,	we	can	write	a	complete	web	application	without	the	need	for	third- party	templating	engine.	For	example,	have	a	look	at	the	following	code;	this	is	a standalone,	simple	Hello	World	application	with	a	bit	of	HTML	styling	included:  from	flask	import	Flask	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 	 @app.route ' ' 	 @app.route ' hello' 	 @app.route ' hello  ' 	 def	hello_world user=None :	 				user	=	user	or	'Shalabh'	 				return	'''	  	 				 	 						 Flask	Framework	Cookbook 	 	 				 	 						 	 								 Hello	%s! 	 								 Welcome	to	the	world	of	Flask! 	 						 	  '''	%	user	 	 if	__name__	==	'__main__':	 				app.run  	  Is	the	preceding	pattern	of	application	writing	feasible	in	the	case	of	large applications	that	involve	thousands	of	lines	of	HTML,	JS,	and	CSS	code, though?	Obviously	not!  Fortunately,	templating	offers	a	solution,	because	it	allows	us	to	structure	our view	code	by	keeping	our	templates	separate.	Flask	provides	default	support	for Jinja2,	although	we	can	use	any	templating	engine	that	suits.	Furthermore,	Jinja2 provides	many	additional	features	that	make	templates	very	powerful	and modular.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:   Bootstrapping	the	recommended	layout Implementing	block	composition	and	layout	inheritance Creating	a	custom	context	processor Creating	a	custom	Jinja2	filter Creating	a	custom	macro	for	forms Advanced	date	and	time	formatting   Bootstrapping	the	recommended layout  Most	of	the	applications	in	Flask	follow	a	specific	pattern	of	laying	out templates.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	implement	the	recommended	way	of structuring	the	layout	of	templates	in	a	Flask	application.   Getting	ready  By	default,	Flask	expects	templates	to	be	placed	inside	a	folder	named	templates at	the	application	root	level.	If	this	folder	is	present,	then	Flask	will automatically	read	the	contents	by	making	the	contents	of	this	folder	available for	use	with	the	render_template  	method,	which	we	will	use	extensively throughout	this	book.   How	to	do	it...  Let's	demonstrate	this	with	a	small	application.	This	application	is	very	similar to	the	one	we	developed	in	Chapter	1,	Flask	Configurations.  The	first	thing	to	do	is	to	add	a	new	folder	named	templates	under	my_app.	The application	structure	should	look	like	the	following	directory	structure:  flask_app 	 				-	run.py	 				my_app 	 								-	__init__.py	 								-	hello 	 												-	__init__.py	 												-	views.py	 								-	templates	  We	now	need	to	make	some	changes	to	the	application.	The	hello_world	method	in the	views	file,	my_app hello views.py,	should	look	like	the	following	lines	of	code:  from	flask	import	render_template,	request	  @hello.route ' ' 	 @hello.route ' hello' 	 def	hello_world  :	 				user	=	request.args.get 'user',	'Shalabh' 	 				return	render_template 'index.html',	user=user 	  In	the	preceding	method,	we	look	for	a	URL	query	argument,	user.	If	it	is	found, we	use	it,	and	if	not,	we	use	the	default	argument,	Shalabh.	Then,	this	value	is passed	to	the	context	of	the	template	to	be	rendered,	that	is,	index.html,	and	the resulting	template	is	rendered.  The	my_app templates index.html	template	can	simply	be	the	following:   	 		 	 				 Flask	Framework	Cookbook 	 		 	 		 	 				 Hello	{{	user	}}! 	 				 Welcome	to	the	world	of	Flask! 	 		 	  	   How	it	works...  Now,	if	we	open	the	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 hello	URL	in	a	browser,	we	should	see	a response	similar	to	the	one	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:  If	we	pass	a	URL	argument	with	the	user	key	as	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 hello? user=John,	we	should	see	the	following	response:  As	we	can	see	in	views.py,	the	argument	passed	in	the	URL	is	fetched	from	the request	object	using	request.args.get 'user' 	and	then	passed	to	the	context	of	the template	being	rendered	using	render_template.	The	argument	is	then	parsed	using the	Jinja2	placeholder,	{{	user	}},	to	fetch	the	contents	from	the	current	value	of the	user	variable	from	the	template	context.	This	placeholder	evaluates	all	of	the expressions	placed	inside	it,	depending	on	the	template	context.  The	Jinja2	documentation	can	be	found	at	http:  jinja.pocoo.org .	This	will	come	in	handy	when writing	templates.   Implementing	block	composition	and layout	inheritance  Usually,	any	web	application	will	have	a	number	of	web	pages	that	are	different to	each	other.	However,	code	blocks	such	as	headers	and	footers	will	appear	the same	on	almost	all	pages	throughout	the	site;	likewise,	the	menu	will	remain	the same.	In	fact,	it	is	usually	just	the	center	container	block	that	changes.	For	this, Jinja2	provides	a	great	way	of	ensuring	inheritance	among	templates.  With	this	in	mind,	it's	good	practice	to	have	a	base	template	where	the	basic layout	of	the	site,	along	with	the	header	and	footer,	can	be	structured.   Getting	ready  In	this	recipe,	we	will	try	to	create	a	small	application	where	we	will	have	a home	page	and	a	product	page	 such	as	the	ones	we	see	on	e-commerce	stores . We	will	use	the	Bootstrap	framework	to	give	a	minimalistic	design	to	our template.	Bootstrap	can	be	downloaded	from	http:  getbootstrap.com .  The	version	of	Bootstrap	used	in	this	book	is	version	3.	Different	versions	of	bootstrap	might cause	the	UI	of	an	application	to	behave	in	different	ways,	but	the	core	essence	of	Bootstrap remains	the	same.  In	this	section,	we	have	a	hardcoded	data	store	for	a	few	products	found	in	the models.py	file.	These	are	read	in	views.py	and	are	sent	over	to	the	template	as template	context	variables	via	the	render_template  	method.	The	rest	of	the parsing	and	display	is	handled	by	the	templating	language,	which	in	our	case	is Jinja2.   How	to	do	it...  Have	a	look	at	the	following	layout:  flask_app 	 				-	run.py	 				my_app 	 								-	__init__.py	 								-	product 	 												-	__init__.py	 												-	views.py	 												-	models.py	 								-	templates 	 												-	base.html	 												-	home.html	 												-	product.html	 								-	static 	 												-	js 	 																-	bootstrap.min.js	 												-	css 	 																-	bootstrap.min.css	 																-	main.css	  PRODUCTS	=	{	 				'iphone':	{	 								'name':	'iPhone	5S',	 								'category':	'Phones',	 								'price':	699,	 				},		 				'galaxy':	{	 								'name':	'Samsung	Galaxy	5',	 								'category':	'Phones',	 								'price':	649,	 				},	 				'ipad-air':	{	 								'name':	'iPad	Air',	 								'category':	'Tablets',	 								'price':	649,	 				},	 				'ipad-mini':	{	 								'name':	'iPad	Mini',	 								'category':	'Tablets',	 								'price':	549	  In	the	preceding	layout,	static css bootstrap.min.css	and	static js bootstrap.min.js are	standard	files	that	can	be	downloaded	from	the	Bootstrap	website	mentioned in	the	Getting	ready	section.	The	run.py	file	remains	the	same,	as	always.	The	rest of	the	application	building	process	is	as	follows:  First,	define	the	models	in	my_app product models.py.	In	this	chapter,	we	will	work on	a	simple,	non-persistent	key-value	store.	We	will	start	with	a	few	hardcoded product	records	made	well	in	advance,	as	follows:   								'price':	549	 				}	 }	  Next	comes	the	views,	that	is,	my_app product views.py.	Here,	we	will	follow	the blueprint	style	to	write	the	application,	as	follows:  from	werkzeug	import	abort	 from	flask	import	render_template	 from	flask	import	Blueprint	 from	my_app.product.models	import	PRODUCTS	 	 product_blueprint	=	Blueprint 'product',	__name__ 	 	 @product_blueprint.route ' ' 	 @product_blueprint.route ' home' 	 def	home  :	 				return	render_template 'home.html',	products=PRODUCTS 	 	 @product_blueprint.route ' product  ' 	 def	product key :	 				product	=	PRODUCTS.get key 	 				if	not	product:	 								abort 404 	 				return	render_template 'product.html',	product=product 	  The	name	of	the	blueprint	 product 	that	is	passed	in	the	Blueprint	constructor	will be	appended	to	the	endpoints	defined	in	this	blueprint.	Have	a	look	at	the base.html	code	for	clarity.  The	abort  	method	comes	in	handy	when	you	want	to	abort	a	request	with	a	specific	error message.	Flask	provides	basic	error	message	pages	that	can	be	customized	as	needed.	We will	look	at	them	in	the	Creating	custom	404	and	500	handlers	recipe	in	Chapter	4,	Working with	Views.  Now,	create	the	application's	configuration	file,	my_app __init__.py,	which	should look	like	the	following	lines	of	code:  from	flask	import	Flask	 from	my_app.product.views	import	product_blueprint	 	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 app.register_blueprint product_blueprint 	  As	well	as	the	CSS	code	provided	by	Bootstrap,	add	a	bit	of	custom	CSS	code	in my_app static css main.css,	as	follows:  body	{	 		padding-top:	50px;	 }	 .top-pad	{	 		padding:	40px	15px;	 		text-align:	center;	 }	   }	  When	considering	templates,	remember	that	the	first	template	acts	as	the	base for	all	templates.	Name	this	template	base.html	and	place	it in	my_app templates base.html,	as	follows:   	  	 		 	 				 	 				 	 				<meta	name="viewport"	content="width=device-width,	initial- 							scale=1">	 				 Flask	Framework	Cookbook 	 				<link	href="{{	url_for 'static',	 							filename='css bootstrap.min.css' 	}}"	rel="stylesheet">	 				<link	href="{{	url_for 'static',	filename='css main.css' 	}}"	 							rel="stylesheet">	 		 	 		 	 				<div	class="navbar	navbar-inverse	navbar-fixed-top"	 							role="navigation">	 						 	 								 	 										<a	class="navbar-brand"	href="{{	url_for 'product.home' 	 													}}">Flask	Cookbook 	 								 	 						 	 				 	 				 	 						{%	block	container	%}{%	endblock	%}	 				 	 	 				 	 				<script	src="https:  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery  							2.0.0 jquery.min.js"> 	 				<script	src="{{	url_for 'static',	filename='js  							bootstrap.min.js' 	}}"> 	 		 	  	  Most	of	the	preceding	code	contains	normal	HTML	and	Jinja2	evaluation placeholders,	which	we	introduced	in	the	previous	chapter.	An	important	point to	note,	however,	is	how	the	url_for  	method	is	used	for	blueprint	URLs.	The blueprint	name	is	appended	to	all	endpoints.	This	becomes	very	useful	when there	are	multiple	blueprints	inside	one	application,	as	some	of	them	may	have similar	looking	URLs.  On	the	home	page,	my_app templates home.html,	iterate	over	all	the	products	and display	them,	as	follows:  {%	extends	'base.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				{%	for	id,	product	in	products.items  	%}	   				{%	for	id,	product	in	products.items  	%}	 						 	 								 	 										 {{	 													product['name']	}} 	 										 $	{{	product['price']	}} 	 								 	 						 	 				{%	endfor	%}	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  Then,	create	the	individual	product	page,	my_app templates product.html,	which should	look	like	the	following	lines	of	code:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				 {{	product['name']	}}	 						 {{	product['category']	}} 	 				 	 				 $	{{	product['price']	}} 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	   How	it	works...  In	the	preceding	template	structure,	there	is	an	inheritance	pattern	being followed.	The	base.html	file	acts	as	the	base	template	for	all	other	templates.	The home.html	file	inherits	from	base.html,	and	product.html	inherits	from	home.html.	In product.html,	the	container	block	is	overwritten,	which	was	first	populated	in home.html.	When	this	app	is	run,	we	should	see	output	similar	to	that	shown	in	the following	screenshot:  The	preceding	screenshot	shows	how	the	home	page	will	look.	Note	the	URL	in the	browser.	The	product	page	should	appear	as	follows:    Creating	a	custom	context	processor  Sometimes,	we	might	want	to	calculate	or	process	a	value	directly	in	templates. Jinja2	maintains	the	notion	that	the	processing	of	logic	should	be	handled	in views	and	not	in	templates,	and	so	keeps	templates	clean.	A	context	processor becomes	a	handy	tool	in	this	case.	With	a	context	processor,	we	can	pass	our values	to	a	method,	which	will	then	be	processed	in	a	Python	method,	and	our resultant	value	will	be	returned.	This	is	done	by	simply	adding	a	function	to	the template	context,	thanks	to	Python	allowing	its	users	to	pass	functions	like	any other	object.	In	this	recipe,	we'll	see	how	to	write	a	custom	context	processor.   How	to	do	it...  To	write	a	custom	context	processor,	follow	the	required	steps.  Let's	first	display	the	descriptive	name	of	the	product	in	the	format	Category	  Product-name.	Afterwards,	add	the	method	to	my_app product views.py,	as	follows:  @product_blueprint.context_processor def	product_name_processor  :	 				def	full_name product :	 								return	'{0}	 	{1}'.format product['category'],	 											product['name'] 	 				return	{'full_name':	full_name}	  A	context	is	simply	a	dictionary	that	can	be	modified	to	add	or	remove	values. Any	method	decorated	with	@product_blueprint.context_processor	should	return	a dictionary	that	updates	the	actual	context.	We	can	use	the	preceding	context processor	as	follows:  {{	full_name product 	}}	  We	can	add	the	preceding	code	to	our	app	for	the	product	listing	 in	the flask_app my_app templates product.html	file 	in	the	following	manner:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				 {{	full_name product 	}} 	 				 {{	product['name']	}}	 						 {{	product['category']	}} 	 				 	 				 $	{{	product['price']	}} 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  The	resulting	parsed	HTML	page	should	look	like	the	following	screenshot:   Have	a	look	at	the	Implementing	block	composition	and	layout	inheritance	recipe	to understand	the	context	of	this	recipe.   Creating	a	custom	Jinja2	filter  After	looking	at	the	previous	recipe,	experienced	developers	might	wonder	why we	used	a	context	processor	for	the	purpose	of	creating	a	well-formatted	product name.	Well,	we	can	also	write	a	filter	for	the	same	purpose,	which	will	make things	much	cleaner.	A	filter	can	be	written	to	display	the	descriptive	name	of	a product,	as	shown	in	the	following	example:  @product_blueprint.app_template_filter 'full_name' 	 def	full_name_filter product :	 				return	'{0}	 	{1}'.format product['category'],	 							product['name'] 	  This	can	also	be	used	as	follows:  {{	productfull_name	}}	  The	preceding	code	will	yield	a	similar	result	as	in	the	previous	recipe.	Moving on,	let's	now	take	things	to	a	higher	level	by	using	external	libraries	to	format currency.   How	to	do	it...  First,	let's	create	a	filter	to	format	a	currency	based	on	the	current	local	language. Add	the	following	code	to	my_app __init__.py:  import	ccy	 from	flask	import	request	 	 @app.template_filter 'format_currency' 	 def	format_currency_filter amount :	 				currency_code	=	ccy.countryccy request.accept_languages.best[- 							2:] 	 				return	'{0}	{1}'.format currency_code,	amount 	  request.accept_languages	might	not	work	in	cases	where	a	request	does	not	have	the	ACCEPT- LANGUAGES	header.  The	preceding	snippet	will	require	the	installation	of	a	new	package,	ccy,	as follows:  $	pip3	install	ccy  The	filter	created	in	this	example	takes	the	language	that	best	matches	the current	browser	locale	 which,	in	my	case,	is	en-US ,	takes	the	last	two characters	from	the	locale	string,	and	then	generates	the	currency	as	per	the	ISO country	code,	which	is	represented	by	the	two	characters.  An	interesting	point	to	note	in	this	recipe	is	that	the	Jinja2	filter	can	be	created	at	the blueprint	level	as	well	as	at	the	application	level.	If	the	filter	is	at	the	blueprint	level,	the decorator	would	be	app_template_filter;	otherwise,	at	the	application	level,	the	decorator	would be	template_filter.   How	it	works...  The	filter	can	be	used	in	our	template	for	the	product	as	follows:   {{	product['price']format_currency	}} 	  The	preceding	code	will	yield	the	result	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:   See	also  The	Implementing	block	composition	and	layout	inheritance	recipe	will	aid	your understanding	of	the	context	of	this	recipe.   Creating	a	custom	macro	for	forms  Macros	allow	us	to	write	reusable	pieces	of	HTML	blocks.	They	are	analogous to	functions	in	regular	programming	languages.	We	can	pass	arguments	to macros	as	we	do	to	functions	in	Python,	and	we	can	then	use	them	to	process	an HTML	block.	Macros	can	be	called	any	number	of	times,	and	the	output	will vary	as	per	the	logic	inside	them.	In	this	recipe,	let's	understand	how	to	write	a macro	in	Jinja2.   Getting	ready  Macros	in	Jinja2	are	a	very	common	topic	and	have	a	lot	of	use	cases.	Here,	we will	just	take	a	look	at	how	a	macro	can	be	created	and	then	used	after	importing it.   How	to	do	it...  One	of	the	most	redundant	pieces	of	code	in	HTML	is	that	which	defines	input fields	in	forms.	This	is	because	most	fields	have	similar	code	with	style modifications,	for	example.  The	following	snippet	is	a	macro	that	creates	input	fields	when	called.	Best practice	is	to	create	the	macro	in	a	separate	file	for	better	reusability,	for example,	_helpers.html:  {%	macro	render_field name,	class='',	value='',	type='text' 	-%}	 				<input	type="{{	type	}}"	name="{{	name	}}"	class="{{	class	}}"	 								value="{{	value	}}" >	 {%-	endmacro	%}	  The	minus	sign	 - 	before	and	after	%	will	strip	the	whitespace	before	and	after	these	blocks, making	the	HTML	code	cleaner	to	read.  Now	the	macro	should	be	imported	in	the	file	to	be	used,	as	follows:  {%	from	'_helpers.html'	import	render_field	%}	  It	can	now	be	called	using	the	following	code:   	 				{{	render_field 'username',	'icon-user' 	}}	 				{{	render_field 'password',	'icon-key',	type='password' 	}}	  	  It	is	always	good	practice	to	define	macros	in	a	different	file	to	keep	the	code clean	and	increase	code	readability.  If	you	need	to	write	a	private	macro	that	cannot	be	accessed	from	outside	its	current	file, name	the	macro	with	an	underscore	preceding	the	name.   Advanced	date	and	time	formatting  Date	and	time	formatting	is	a	painful	thing	to	handle	in	web	applications.	Such formatting	in	Python,	using	the	datetime	library,	often	increases	overhead	and	is pretty	complex	when	it	comes	to	the	correct	handling	of	time	zones.	We	should standardize	timestamps	to	UTC	when	they	are	stored	in	the	database,	but	this means	that	the	same	needs	to	be	processed	every	time	it	is	presented	to	users around	the	world.  Instead,	it	is	smarter	to	defer	this	processing	to	the	client	side,	that	is,	the browser.	The	browser	always	knows	the	current	time	zone	of	its	user	and	will therefore	be	able	to	manipulate	the	date	and	time	information	correctly.	This approach	also	reduces	any	unnecessary	overhead	from	our	application	servers.	In this	recipe,	we	will	understand	how	to	achieve	this.	We	will	use	Moment.js	for this	purpose.  In	this	recipe,	it	is	assumed	that	the	reader	has	some	prior	JavaScript	knowledge.   Getting	ready  Just	like	any	JS	library,	Moment.js	can	be	included	in	our	app	in	the	following manner.	We	will	just	have	to	download	and	place	the	JS	file,	moment.min.js,	in	the static js	folder.	The	Moment.js	file	can	be	downloaded	from	http:  momentjs.com . This	file	can	then	be	used	in	an	HTML	file	by	adding	the	following	statement along	with	other	JavaScript	libraries:    	  The	basic	usage	of	Moment.js	is	shown	in	the	following	code.	This	can	be	done in	the	browser	console	for	JavaScript:  >>>	moment  .calendar  ;	 "Today	at	1:35	P"	 >>>	moment  .endOf 'day' .fromNow  ;	 "in	10	hours"	 >>>	moment  .format 'LLLL' ;	 "Monday,	December	17,	2018	1:35	PM"	   How	to	do	it...  To	use	Moment.js	in	an	application,	please	follow	the	required	steps:  First,	write	a	wrapper	in	Python	and	use	it	via	the	jinja	environment	variables,	as follows:  from	jinja2	import	Markup	 	 class	momentjs object :	 				def	__init__ self,	timestamp :	 								self.timestamp	=	timestamp	 	 					Wrapper	to	call	moment.js	method	 				def	render self,	format :	 								return	Markup " \ndocument.write moment \"%s\" .%s  											;\n "	%	 self.timestamp.strftime "%Y-%m- 											%dT%H:%M:%S" ,	format  	 	 					Format	time	 				def	format self,	fmt :	 								return	self.render "format \"%s\" "	%	fmt 	 	 				def	calendar self :	 								return	self.render "calendar  " 	 	 				def	fromNow self :	 								return	self.render "fromNow  " 	  You	can	add	as	many	Moment.js	methods	as	you	want	to	parse	to	the	preceding class,	as	and	when	they're	needed.	Now,	in	your	app.py	file,	set	the	following created	class	to	the	jinja	environment	variables:  	Set	jinja	template	global	 app.jinja_env.globals['momentjs']	=	momentjs	  You	can	now	use	the	class	in	templates,	as	shown	in	the	following	example. Make	sure	that	the	timestamp	is	an	instance	of	a	JavaScript	date	object:   Current	time:	{{	momentjs timestamp .calendar  	}} 	  	  Time:	{{momentjs timestamp .format 'YYYY-MM-DD	HH:mm:ss' }} 	  	  From	now:	{{momentjs timestamp .fromNow  }} 	   See	more  You	can	read	more	about	the	Moment.js	library	at	http:  momentjs.com .   Data	Modeling	in	Flask  This	chapter	covers	one	of	the	most	important	aspects	of	any	application,	that	is, the	interaction	with	database	systems.	This	will	take	us	through	how	Flask	can connect	to	database	systems,	define	models,	and	query	the	databases	for	the retrieval	and	feeding	of	data.	Flask	has	been	designed	to	be	flexible	enough	to support	any	database.	The	simplest	way	would	be	to	use	the	direct	SQLite3 package,	which	is	a	DB-API	2.0	interface	and	does	not	give	an	actual	object- relational	mapper	 ORM .	Here,	we	need	to	use	SQL	queries	to	talk	with	the database.	This	approach	is	not	recommended	for	large	projects	as	it	can eventually	become	a	nightmare	to	maintain	the	application.	Also,	with	this approach,	the	models	are	virtually	non-existent	and	everything	happens	in	the view	functions,	where	we	write	queries	to	interact	with	the	database.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	talk	about	creating	an	ORM	layer	for	our	Flask applications	with	SQLAlchemy	for	relational	database	systems,	which	is recommended	and	widely	used	for	applications	of	any	size.	Also,	we	will	have	a glance	over	how	to	write	a	Flask	app	with	the	NoSQL	database	system.  ORM	refers	to	ORM	and	implies	how	our	application's	data	models	store	and	deal	with	data at	a	conceptual	level.	A	powerful	ORM	makes	the	designing	and	querying	of	business	logic easy	and	streamlined.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Creating	an	SQLAlchemy	DB	instance Creating	a	basic	product	model Creating	a	relational	category	model Migrating	databases	using	Alembic	and	Flask-Migrate Indexing	model	data	with	Redis Opting	for	the	NoSQL	way	with	MongoDB   Creating	an	SQLAlchemy	DB instance  SQLAlchemy	is	a	Python	SQL	toolkit	and	provides	an	ORM	that	gives	the flexibility	and	power	of	SQL	with	the	feel	of	Python's	object-oriented	nature.	In this	recipe,	we	will	understand	how	to	create	a	SQLAlchemy	database	instance that	can	be	used	to	perform	any	database	operation	that	shall	be	covered	in	future recipes.	   Getting	ready  Flask-SQLAlchemy	is	the	extension	that	provides	the	SQLAlchemy	interface	for Flask.  This	extension	can	simply	be	installed	by	using	pip	as	follows:  				$	pip3	install	flask-sqlalchemy  The	first	thing	to	keep	in	mind	with	Flask-SQLAlchemy	is	the	application configuration	parameter	that	tells	SQLAlchemy	about	the	location	of	the database	to	be	used:  app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']	=	os.environ 'DATABASE_URI' 	  SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI	is	a	combination	of	the	database	protocol,	any authentication	needed,	and	also	the	name	of	the	database.	In	the	case	of	SQLite, this	would	look	something	like	the	following:  sqlite:    tmp test.db	  In	the	case	of	PostgreSQL,	it	would	look	like	the	following:  postgresql:  yourusername:yourpassword@localhost yournewdb.	  This	extension	then	provides	a	class	named	Model	that	helps	defining	models	for our	application.	Read	more	about	database	URLs	at	https:  docs.sqlalchemy.org en 1 3 core engines.htmldatabase-urls.  For	all	database	systems	other	than	SQLite,	separate	libraries	are	needed.	For	example,	for using	PostgreSQL,	you	need	psycopg2.   How	to	do	it...  Let's	create	a	small	application	in	this	recipe	to	understand	the	basic	database connection	with	Flask.	We	will	build	over	this	application	in	the	next	few recipes.	Here,	we	will	just	see	how	to	create	a	db	instance	and	some	basic database	commands.	The	file's	structure	would	look	like	the	following:  flask_catalog 	 				-	run.py 				my_app  							-	__init__.py	  First,	we	start	with	flask_app run.py.	This	is	the	usual	run	file	that	we	have	read about	previously	in	this	book:  from	my_app	import	app	 app.run debug=True 	  Then,	we	configure	our	application	configuration	file,	that is,	flask_app my_app __init__.py:  from	flask	import	Flask	 from	flask_sqlalchemy	import	SQLAlchemy	 	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']	=	'sqlite:    tmp test.db'	 db	=	SQLAlchemy app 	  Here,	we	configure	our	application	to	point	SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI	to	a	specific location.	Then,	we	create	an	object	of	SQLAlchemy	with	the	name	db.	As	the	name suggests,	this	is	the	object	that	will	handle	all	our	ORM-related	activities.	As mentioned	earlier,	this	object	has	a	class	named	Model,	which	provides	the	base for	creating	models	in	Flask.	Any	class	can	just	subclass	or	inherit	the	Model	class to	create	models,	which	will	act	as	database	tables.  Now,	if	we	open	the	http:  127.0.0.1:5000	URL	in	a	browser,	we	will	see	nothing. This	is	because	we	have	just	configured	the	database	connection	for	this application	and	there	is	nothing	to	be	seen	on	the	browser.	However,	you	can always	head	to	the	location	specified	in	app.config	for	the	database	location	to	see the	newly	created	test.db	file.   There's	more...  Sometimes,	you	may	want	a	single	SQLAlchemy	db	instance	to	be	used	across multiple	applications,	or	create	an	application	dynamically.	In	such	cases,	we might	not	prefer	to	bind	our	db	instance	to	a	single	application.	Here,	we	will have	to	work	with	the	application	context	to	achieve	the	desired	outcome.  In	this	case,	we	will	register	our	application	with	SQLAlchemy	differently	as follows:  from	flask	import	Flask	 from	flask_sqlalchemy	import	SQLAlchemy	 	 db	=	SQLAlchemy  	 	 def	create_app  :	 				app	=	Flask __name__ 	 				db.init_app app 	 				return	app	  The	preceding	approach	can	be	taken	up	while	initializing	the	app	with	any	Flask	extension, and	is	very	common	when	dealing	with	real-life	applications.  Now,	all	the	operations	that	were	earlier	possible	globally	with	the	db	instance will	now	require	a	Flask	application	context	at	all	times.  The	Flask	application	context	is	as	follows:  >>>	from	my_app	import	create_app	 >>>	app	=	create_app  	 >>>	app.test_request_context  .push  	 >>>		Do	whatever	needs	to	be	done	 >>>	app.test_request_context  .pop  	  Or,	we	can	use	context	manager,	shown	as	follows:  with	app  :	 					We	have	flask	application	context	now	till	we	are	inside	the	with	block	   See	also  The	next	couple	of	recipes	will	extend	the	current	application	to	make	a complete	application,	which	will	help	us	to	understand	the	ORM	layer	better.   Creating	a	basic	product	model  In	this	recipe,	we	will	create	an	application	that	will	help	us	to	store	products	to be	displayed	on	the	catalog	section	of	a	website.	It	should	be	possible	to	add products	to	the	catalog,	and	then	delete	as	and	when	required.	As	we	saw	in previous	chapters,	this	is	possible	to	do	using	non-persistent	storage	as	well. Here,	however,	we	will	store	data	in	a	database	to	have	persistent	storage.   How	to	do	it...  The	new	directory	layout	would	appear	as	follows:  flask_catalog 	 				-	run.py 				my_app 	 								-	__init__.py	 								catalog 	 												-	__init__.py	 												-	views.py	 												-	models.py	  First	of	all,	start	with	modifying	the	application	configuration	file,	that	is, flask_catalog my_app __init__.py:  from	flask	import	Flask	 from	flask_sqlalchemy	import	SQLAlchemy	 	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']	=	'sqlite:    tmp test.db'	 db	=	SQLAlchemy app 	 	 from	my_app.catalog.views	import	catalog	 app.register_blueprint catalog 	 	 db.create_all  	  The	last	statement	in	the	file	is	db.create_all  ,	which	tells	the	application	to create	all	the	tables	in	the	database	specified.	So,	as	soon	as	the	application	runs, all	the	tables	will	be	created	if	they	are	not	already	there.  Now	is	the	time	to	create	models	that	are	placed	in flask_catalog my_app catalog models.py:  from	my_app	import	db	 	 class	Product db.Model :	 				id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	primary_key=True 	 				name	=	db.Column db.String 255  	 				price	=	db.Column db.Float 	 	 				def	__init__ self,	name,	price :	 								self.name	=	name	 								self.price	=	price	 	 				def	__repr__ self :	 								return	' '	%	self.id	   In	this	file,	we	have	created	a	model	named	Product,	which	has	three	fields, namely	id,	name,	and	price.	id	is	a	self-generated	field	in	the	database,	which	will store	the	ID	of	the	record	and	is	the	primary	key.	name	is	a	field	of	the	string type,	and	price	is	a	field	of	the	float	type	 which	is	coerced	as	decimal .  Now,	add	a	new	file	for	views,	which	is	flask_catalog my_app catalog views.py.	In this	file,	we	have	multiple	view	methods,	which	control	how	we	deal	with	the product	model	and	the	web	application	in	general:  from	flask	import	request,	jsonify,	Blueprint	 from	my_app	import	db	 from	my_app.catalog.models	import	Product	 	 catalog	=	Blueprint 'catalog',	__name__ 	 	 @catalog.route ' ' 	 @catalog.route ' home' 	 def	home  :	 				return	"Welcome	to	the	Catalog	Home."	  The	preceding	method	handles	how	the	home	page	or	the	application	landing page	looks	or	responds	to	users.	You	would	most	probably	want	to	use	a template	for	rendering	this	in	your	applications.	We	will	cover	this	a	bit later.	Have	a	look	at	the	following	code:  @catalog.route ' product  ' 	 def	product id :	 				product	=	Product.query.get_or_404 id 	 				return	'Product	-	%s,	$%s'	%	 product.name,	product.price 	  The	preceding	method	controls	the	output	to	be	shown	when	a	user	looks	for	a specific	product	using	its	ID.	We	filter	for	the	product	using	the	ID	and	then return	its	information	if	a	product	is	found,	or	else	abort	with	a	404	error. Consider	the	following	code:  @catalog.route ' products' 	 def	products  :	 				products	=	Product.query.all  	 				res	=	{}	 				for	product	in	products:	 								res[product.id]	=	{	 												'name':	product.name,	 												'price':	str product.price 	 								}	 				return	jsonify res 	  The	preceding	method	returns	a	list	of	all	products	in	the	database	in	JSON format.	If	no	product	is	found,	it	aborts	with	a	404	error.	Consider	the	following   code:  @catalog.route ' product-create',	methods=['POST',] 	 def	create_product  :	 				name	=	request.form.get 'name' 	 				price	=	request.form.get 'price' 	 				product	=	Product name,	price 	 				db.session.add product 	 				db.session.commit  	 				return	'Product	created.'	  The	preceding	method	controls	the	creation	of	a	product	in	the	database.	We	first get	the	information	from	a	request	and	then	create	a	Product	instance	from	this information.	Then,	we	add	this	Product	instance	to	the	database	session	and	finally commit	to	save	the	record	to	the	database.   How	it	works...  In	the	beginning,	the	database	is	empty	and	has	no	products.	This	can	be confirmed	by	opening	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 products	in	a	browser.	This	would result	in	a	404	NOT	FOUND	error	page.  Now,	first	we	would	want	to	create	a	product.	For	this,	we	need	to	send	a	POST request,	which	can	easily	be	sent	from	the	Python	prompt	using	the	requests library:  >>>	import	requests >>>	requests.post 'http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product-create',	 				data={'name':	'iPhone	5S',	'price':	'549.0'}  		  To	install	the	requests	library,	run	pip3	install	requests	in	your	Terminal.  To	confirm	whether	the	product	is	now	in	the	database,	we	can	open http:  127.0.0.1:5000 products	in	the	browser	again.	This	time,	it	would	show	a JSON	dump	of	the	product	details.   See	also  Refer	to	the	following	recipe,	Creating	a	relational	category	model,	which demonstrates	the	relational	aspect	of	tables.   Creating	a	relational	category	model  In	our	previous	recipe,	we	created	a	simple	product	model,	which	had	a	couple of	fields.	In	practice,	however,	the	applications	are	much	more	complex	and have	various	relationships	among	their	tables.	These	relationships	can	be	one-to- one,	one-to-many,	many-to-one,	or	many-to-many.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	try	to understand	some	of	these	relationships	with	the	help	of	an	example.   How	to	do	it...  Let's	say	we	want	to	have	product	categories	where	each	category	can	have multiple	products,	but	each	product	should	have	only	one	category.	Let's	do	this by	modifying	some	files	from	the	preceding	application.	We	will	make modifications	to	both	models	and	views.	In	models,	we	will	add	a	Category	model, and,	in	views,	we	will	add	new	methods	to	handle	category-related	calls	and	also modify	the	existing	methods	to	accommodate	the	newly	added	feature.  First,	modify	the	models.py	file	to	add	the	Category	model	and	make	some modifications	to	the	Product	model:  from	my_app	import	db	 	 class	Product db.Model :	 				id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	primary_key=True 	 				name	=	db.Column db.String 255  	 				price	=	db.Column db.Float 	 				category_id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	 							db.ForeignKey 'category.id'  	 				category	=	db.relationship 	 								'Category',	backref=db.backref 'products',	lazy='dynamic' 	 				 	 	 				def	__init__ self,	name,	price,	category :	 								self.name	=	name	 								self.price	=	price	 								self.category	=	category	 	 				def	__repr__ self :	 								return	' '	%	self.id	  In	the	preceding	Product	model,	check	the	newly	added	fields	for	category_id	and category.	category_id	is	the	foreign	key	to	the	Category	model,	and	category	represents the	relationship	table.	As	evident	from	the	definitions	themselves,	one	of	them	is a	relationship,	and	the	other	uses	this	relationship	to	store	the	foreign	key	value in	the	database.	This	is	a	simple	many-to-one	relationship	from	product	to category.	Also,	notice	the	backref	argument	in	the	category	field;	this	argument allows	us	to	access	products	from	the	Category	model	by	writing	something	as simple	as	category.products	in	our	views.	This	acts	like	the	one-to-many relationship	from	the	other	end.  Just	adding	the	field	to	the	model	would	not	get	reflected	in	the	database	in	the	right	away. You	might	need	to	drop	the	whole	database	and	then	run	the	application	again	or	run   migrations,	which	shall	be	covered	in	the	next	recipe,	Migrating	databases	using	Alembic	and Flask-Migrate.  Create	a	Category	model	which	has	just	one	field	called	name,	as	shown	below:  class	Category db.Model :	 				id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	primary_key=True 	 				name	=	db.Column db.String 100  	 	 				def	__init__ self,	name :	 								self.name	=	name	 	 				def	__repr__ self :	 								return	' '	%	self.id	  The	preceding	code	is	the	Category	model,	which	has	just	one	field	called	name.  Now,	modify	the	views.py	to	accommodate	the	change	in	the	models.  Make	the	first	change	in	the	products  	method.  from	my_app.catalog.models	import	Product,	Category	 	 @catalog.route ' products' 	 def	products  :	 				products	=	Product.query.all  	 				res	=	{}	 				for	product	in	products:	 								res[product.id]	=	{	 												'name':	product.name,	 												'price':	product.price,	 												'category':	product.category.name	 								}	 				return	jsonify res 	  Here,	we	have	just	one	change	where	we	are	sending	the	category	name	in	the product's	JSON	data,	which	is	being	generated	to	be	returned	as	a	response	when a	request	is	made	to	the	preceding	endpoint.  Change	the	create_products  	method	to	look	for	category	before	creating	the product:  @catalog.route ' product-create',	methods=['POST',] 	 def	create_product  :	 				name	=	request.form.get 'name' 	 				price	=	request.form.get 'price' 	 				categ_name	=	request.form.get 'category' 	 				category	=	Category.query.filter_by name=categ_name .first  	 				if	not	category:	 								category	=	Category categ_name 	 				product	=	Product name,	price,	category 	 				db.session.add product 	 				db.session.commit  	 				return	'Product	created.'	   				return	'Product	created.'	  Here,	we	will	first	search	for	an	existing	category	with	the	category	name	in	the request.	If	an	existing	category	is	found,	we	will	use	the	same	in	the	product creation;	otherwise,	we	will	create	a	new	category.  Create	a	new	method	create_category  	to	handle	creation	of	category.  @catalog.route ' category-create',	methods=['POST',] 	 def	create_category  :	 				name	=	request.form.get 'name' 	 				category	=	Category name 	 				db.session.add category 	 				db.session.commit  	 				return	'Category	created.'	  The	preceding	code	is	a	relatively	simple	method	for	creating	a	category	using the	name	provided	in	the	request.  Create	a	new	method	categories  	to	handle	listing	of	all	categories	and corresponding	products.  @catalog.route ' categories' 	 def	categories  :	 				categories	=	Category.query.all  	 				res	=	{}	 				for	category	in	categories:	 								res[category.id]	=	{	 												'name':	category.name	 								}	 								for	product	in	category.products:	 												res[category.id]['products']	=	{	 																'id':	product.id,	 																'name':	product.name,	 																'price':	product.price	 												}	 				return	jsonify res 	  The	preceding	method	does	a	bit	of	tricky	stuff.	Here,	we	fetched	all	the categories	from	the	database,	and	then	for	each	category,	we	fetched	all	the products	and	then	returned	all	the	data	as	a	JSON	dump.   See	also  Refer	to	the	recipe,	Creating	a	basic	product	model,	to	understand	the	context	of this	recipe	and	how	this	recipe	works	for	a	browser,	given	that	its	workings	are very	similar	to	the	previous	one.   Migrating	databases	using	Alembic and	Flask-Migrate  Now,	let's	say	we	want	to	update	our	models	to	have	a	new	field	called	company	in the	Product	model.	One	way	is	to	drop	the	database	and	then	create	a	new	one using	db.drop_all  	and	db.create_all  .	However,	this	approach	cannot	be	followed for	applications	in	production	or	even	in	staging.	We	would	want	to	migrate	our database	to	match	the	newly	updated	model	with	all	the	data	intact.  For	this,	we	have	Alembic,	which	is	a	Python-based	tool	to	manage	database migrations	and	uses	SQLAlchemy	as	the	underlying	engine.	Alembic	provides automatic	migrations	to	a	great	extent	with	some	limitations	 of	course,	we cannot	expect	any	tool	to	be	seamless .	To	act	as	the	icing	on	the	cake,	we	have a	Flask	extension	called	Flask-Migrate,	which	eases	the	process	of	migrations even	more.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	cover	the	basics	of	database	migration techniques	using	Alembic	and	Flask-Migrate.   Getting	ready  First	of	all,	run	the	following	command	to	install	Flask-Migrate:  				$	pip3	install	Flask-Migrate  This	will	also	install	Alembic,	among	a	number	of	other	dependencies.   How	to	do	it...  To	enable	migrations,	we	need	to	modify	our	app	definition	a	bit.	Let's understand	how	such	a	config	appears	if	we	modify	the	same	for	our	catalog application:  The	following	lines	of	code	show	how	my_app __init__.py	appears:  from	flask	import	Flask	 from	flask_sqlalchemy	import	SQLAlchemy	 from	flask_migrate	import	Migrate,	MigrateCommand	 				app	=	Flask __name__ 	 				app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']	=	'sqlite:    tmp test.db'	 				db	=	SQLAlchemy app 	 				migrate	=	Migrate app,	db 	 	 import	my_app.catalog.views	 db.create_all  	  If	we	pass	--help	to	the	flask	command	while	running	it	as	a	script,	the	Terminal will	show	all	the	available	options,	as	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:   To	initialize	migrations,	run	the	init	command:  				$	flask	db	init  The	preceding	command	will	not	work	if	you	do	not	have	the	FLASK_APP	environment variable	configured.	This	can	simply	be	done	by	running	the	following	command	on	the Terminal:  $	export	FLASK_APP=my_app  Once	changes	are	made	to	the	models,	call	the	migrate	command:  To	make	the	changes	reflect	on	the	database,	call	the	upgrade	command:  				$	flask	db	migrate	  				$	flask	db	upgrade	   Now,	let's	say	we	modify	the	model	of	our	product	table	to	add	a	new	field	called company,	as	shown	here:  How	it	works...  class	Product db.Model :	 					...	 					Same	product	model	as	last	recipe	 					...	 				company	=	db.Column db.String 100  	  The	result	of	migrate	will	be	something	like	the	following	snippet:  				$	flask	db	migrate 				INFO		[alembic.runtime.migration]	Context	impl	SQLiteImpl. 				INFO		[alembic.runtime.migration]	Will	assume	non-transactional	 				DDL. 				INFO		[alembic.autogenerate.compare]	Detected	added	column	 				'product.company' 					Generating	   flask_catalog migrations versions 2c08f71f9253_.py	...	done	  In	the	preceding	code,	we	can	see	that	Alembic	compares	the	new	model	with the	database	table	and	detects	a	newly	added	column	for	company	in	the	product table	 created	by	the	Product	model .  Similarly,	the	output	of	upgrade	will	be	something	like	the	following	snippet:  				$	flask	db	upgrade 				INFO		[alembic.runtime.migration]	Context	impl	SQLiteImpl. 				INFO		[alembic.runtime.migration]	Will	assume	non-transactional	 				DDL. 				INFO		[alembic.runtime.migration]	Running	upgrade	None	->	 				2c08f71f9253,	empty	message  Here,	Alembic	performs	the	upgrade	of	the	database	for	the	migration	detected earlier.	We	can	see	a	hex	code	in	the	preceding	output.	This	represents	the revision	of	the	migration	performed.	This	is	for	internal	use	by	Alembic	to	track the	changes	to	database	tables.   See	also  Refer	to	the	Creating	a	basic	product	model	recipe	for	the	context	of	this	recipe.   Indexing	model	data	with	Redis  There	may	be	some	features	that	we	might	want	to	implement,	but	do	not	want to	have	a	persistent	storage	for	them.	So,	we	would	like	to	have	these	stored	in cache-like	storage	for	some	time	and	then	vanish,	for	example,	showing	a	list	of the	recently	visited	products	to	the	visitors	on	the	website.	In	this	recipe,	we	will understand	how	to	use	Redis	as	an	effective	cache	to	store	non-persistent	data that	can	be	accessed	at	a	high	speed.   Getting	ready  We	will	do	this	with	the	help	of	Redis,	which	can	be	installed	using	the following	command:  				$	pip3	install	redis	  Make	sure	that	you	run	the	Redis	server	for	the	connection	to	happen.	To	install and	run	a	Redis	server,	refer	to	http:  redis.io topics quickstart.  Then,	we	need	to	have	the	connection	open	to	Redis.	This	can	be	done	by	adding the	following	lines	of	code	to	my_app __init__.py:  from	redis	import	Redis	 redis	=	Redis  	  We	can	do	this	in	our	application	file,	where	we	will	define	the	app,	or	in	the views	file,	where	we	will	use	it.	It	is	preferred	that	you	do	this	in	the	application file	because	then,	the	connection	will	be	open	throughout	the	application,	and	the redis	object	can	be	used	by	just	importing	it	where	required.   How	to	do	it...  We	will	maintain	a	set	in	Redis,	which	will	store	the	products	visited	recently. This	will	be	populated	whenever	we	visit	a	product.	The	entry	will	expire	in	10 minutes.	This	change	goes	in	views.py:  from	my_app	import	redis	 	 @catalog.route ' product  ' 	 def	product id :	 				product	=	Product.query.get_or_404 id 	 				product_key	=	'product-%s'	%	product.id	 				redis.set product_key,	product.name 	 				redis.expire product_key,	600 	 				return	'Product	-	%s,	$%s'	%	 product.name,	product.price 	  It	is	good	practice	to	fetch	the	expire	time,	that	is,	600,	from	a	configuration	value.	This	can	be set	on	the	application	object	in	my_app __init__.py,	and	can	then	be	fetched	from	there.  In	the	preceding	method,	note	the	set  	and	expire  	methods	on	the	redis	object.  First,	we	set	the	product	ID	using	the	product_key	value	in	the	Redis	store.  Then,	we	set	the	expire	time	of	the	key	to	600	seconds.  Now,	we	will	look	for	the	keys	that	are	still	alive	in	the	cache	and	then	fetch	the products	corresponding	to	these	keys	and	return	them:  @catalog.route ' recent-products' 	 def	recent_products  :	 				keys_alive	=	redis.keys 'product-*' 	 				products	=	[redis.get k .decode 'utf-8' 	for	k	in	keys_alive]	 				return	jsonify {'products':	products} 	   How	it	works...  An	entry	is	added	to	the	store	whenever	a	user	visits	a	product,	and	the	entry	is kept	there	for	600	seconds	 10	minutes .	Now,	this	product	will	be	listed	in	the recent	products	list	for	the	next	10	minutes	unless	it	is	visited	again,	which	will reset	the	time	to	10	minutes	again.   Opting	for	the	NoSQL	way	with MongoDB  Sometimes,	the	data	to	be	used	in	the	application	we	are	building	may	not	be structured	at	all,	may	be	semi-structured,	or	there	may	be	some	data	whose schema	changes	over	time.	In	such	cases,	we	would	refrain	from	using	an RDBMS,	as	it	adds	to	the	pain	and	is	difficult	to	understand	and	maintain.	For such	cases,	we	might	want	to	use	a	NoSQL	database.  Also,	as	a	result	of	fast	and	quick	development	in	the	currently	prevalent development	environment,	it	is	not	always	possible	to	design	the	perfect	schema the	first	time.	NoSQL	provides	the	flexibility	to	modify	the	schema	without much	hassle.  In	production	environments,	the	database	usually	grows	to	a	huge	size	over	a period	of	time.	This	drastically	affects	the	performance	of	the	overall	system. Vertical	and	horizontal	scaling	techniques	are	available,	but	they	can	be	very costly	at	times.	In	such	cases,	a	NoSQL	database	can	be	considered,	as	it	is designed	from	scratch	for	similar	purposes.	The	ability	of	NoSQL	databases	to run	on	large	multiple	clusters	and	handle	huge	volumes	of	data	generated	with high	velocity	makes	them	a	good	choice	when	looking	to	handle	scaling	issues with	traditional	RDBMS.  In	this	recipe,	we	will	use	MongoDB	to	learn	how	to	integrate	NoSQL	with Flask.   Getting	ready  There	are	many	extensions	available	to	use	Flask	with	MongoDB.	We	will	use Flask-MongoEngine,	as	it	provides	a	good	level	of	abstraction,	which	makes	it easy	to	understand.	It	can	be	installed	using	the	following	command:  				$	pip3	install	flask-mongoengine	  Remember	to	run	the	MongoDB	server	for	the	connection	to	happen.	For	more details	on	installing	and	running	MongoDB,	refer	to	http:  docs.mongodb.org manual  installation .   How	to	do	it...  >>>	mongo MongoDB	shell	version:	v4.0.4 >	use	my_catalog switched	to	db	my_catalog  First,	manually	create	a	database	in	MongoDB	using	the	command	line.	Let's name	this	database	my_catalog:  The	following	is	an	application	that	is	a	rewrite	of	our	catalog	application	using MongoDB.  The	first	change	comes	to	our	configuration	file,	my_app __init__.py:  from	flask	import	Flask	 from	flask_mongoengine	import	MongoEngine	 from	redis	import	Redis	 	 	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS']	=	{'DB':	'my_catalog'}	 app.debug	=	True	 db	=	MongoEngine app 	 	 redis	=	Redis  	 	 from	my_app.catalog.views	import	catalog	 app.register_blueprint catalog 	  Note	that	instead	of	the	usual	SQLAlchemy-centric	settings,	we	now	have	MONGODB_SETTINGS. Here,	we	just	specify	the	name	of	the	database	to	use,	which,	in	our	case,	is	my_catalog.  Next,	we	will	create	a	Product	model	using	MongoDB	fields.	This	happens	as usual	in	the	models	file,	flask_catalog my_app catalog models.py:  import	datetime	 from	my_app	import	db	 	 	 class	Product db.Document :	 				created_at	=	db.DateTimeField 	 								default=datetime.datetime.now,	required=True	 				 	 				key	=	db.StringField max_length=255,	required=True 	 				name	=	db.StringField max_length=255,	required=True 	 				price	=	db.DecimalField  	 	 				def	__repr__ self :	 								return	' '	%	self.id	  Now	would	be	a	good	time	to	look	at	the	MongoDB	fields	used	to	create	the	model	above,	and   their	similarity	with	the	SQLAlchemy	fields	used	in	the	previous	recipes.	Here,	instead	of	an ID	field,	we	have	created_at,	which	stores	the	timestamp	in	which	the	record	was	created.	Also note	the	class	that	is	inherited	by	Product	while	creating	the	model.	In	case	of	SQLAlchemy,	it is	db.Model	and,	in	the	case	of	MongoDB,	it	is	db.Document.	This	is	in	accordance	with	how	these database	systems	work.	SQLAlchemy	works	with	conventional	RDBMS,	but	MongoDB	is	a NoSQL	document	database	system.  The	following	is	the	views	file,	namely,	flask_catalog my_app catalog views.py:  from	decimal	import	Decimal	 from	flask	import	request,	Blueprint,	jsonify	 from	my_app.catalog.models	import	Product	 	 catalog	=	Blueprint 'catalog',	__name__ 	 	 @catalog.route ' ' 	 @catalog.route ' home' 	 def	home  :	 				return	"Welcome	to	the	Catalog	Home."	 	 @catalog.route ' product  ' 	 def	product key :	 				product	=	Product.objects.get_or_404 key=key 	 				return	'Product	-	%s,	$%s'	%	 product.name,	product.price 	 	 @catalog.route ' products' 	 def	products  :	 				products	=	Product.objects.all  	 				res	=	{}	 				for	product	in	products:	 								res[product.key]	=	{	 												'name':	product.name,	 												'price':	str product.price ,	 								}	 				return	jsonify res 	 	 @catalog.route ' product-create',	methods=['POST',] 	 def	create_product  :	 				name	=	request.form.get 'name' 	 				key	=	request.form.get 'key' 	 				price	=	request.form.get 'price' 	 				product	=	Product 	 								name=name,	 								key=key,	 								price=Decimal price 	 				 	 				product.save  	 				return	'Product	created.'	  You	will	notice	that	it	is	very	similar	to	the	views	created	for	the	SQLAlchemy- based	models.	There	are	just	a	few	differences	in	the	methods	that	are	called from	the	MongoEngine	extension,	and	these	should	be	easy	to	understand.   See	also  Refer	to	the	Creating	a	basic	product	model	recipe	to	understand	how	this application	works.   Working	with	Views  For	any	web	application,	it	is	very	important	to	control	how	you	interact	with web	requests	and	the	proper	responses	to	be	catered	for	these	requests.	This chapter	takes	us	through	the	various	methods	of	handling	requests	properly	and designing	them	in	the	best	way.  Flask	offers	several	ways	of	designing	and	laying	out	the	URL	routing	for	our applications.	Also,	it	gives	us	the	flexibility	to	keep	the	architecture	of	our	views as	just	functions	or	to	create	classes,	which	can	be	inherited	and	modified	as required.	In	earlier	versions,	Flask	just	had	function-based	views.	Later, however,	in	version	0.7,	inspired	by	Django,	Flask	introduced	the	concept	of pluggable	views,	which	allows	us	to	have	classes	and	then	write	methods	in these	classes.	This	also	makes	the	process	of	building	a	RESTful	API	pretty simple.	Also,	we	can	always	go	a	level	deeper	into	Werkzeug	and	use	the	more flexible,	but	slightly	complex,	concept	of	URL	maps.	In	fact,	large	applications and	frameworks	prefer	using	URL	maps.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Writing	function-based	views	and	URL	routes Writing	class-based	views Implementing	URL	routing	and	product-based	pagination Rendering	to	templates Dealing	with	XHR	requests Using	decorators	to	handle	requests	beautifully Creating	custom	404	and	500	handlers Flashing	messages	for	better	user	feedback Implementing	SQL-based	searching   Writing	function-based	views	and URL	routes  This	is	the	simplest	way	of	writing	views	and	URL	routes	in	Flask.	We	can	just write	a	method	and	decorate	it	with	the	endpoint.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	write	a few	URL	routes	for	GET	and	POST	requests.   Getting	ready  To	go	through	this	recipe,	we	can	start	with	any	Flask	application.	The	app	can be	a	new,	empty,	or	any	complex	app.	We	just	need	to	understand	the	methods outlined	in	this	recipe.   How	to	do	it...  The	following	section	explains	the	three	most	widely	used	different	kinds	of requests,	demonstrated	by	means	of	small	examples.   A	simple	GET	request  The	following	is	a	simple	example	of	what	a	GET	request	looks	like.:  @app.route ' a-get-request' 	 def	get_request  :	 				bar	=	request.args.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 				return	'A	simple	Flask	request	where	foo	is	%s'	%	bar	  Here,	we	just	check	whether	the	URL	query	has	an	argument	called	foo.	If	yes, we	display	this	in	the	response;	otherwise,	the	default	is	bar.   A	simple	POST	request  POST	is	similar	to	the	GET	request,	but	with	a	few	differences:  @app.route ' a-post-request',	methods=['POST'] 	 def	post_request  :	 				bar	=	request.form.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 				return	'A	simple	Flask	request	where	foo	is	%s'	%	bar	  The	route	now	contains	an	extra	argument	called	methods.	Also,	instead	of request.args,	we	now	use	request.form,	as	POST	assumes	that	the	data	is	submitted	in a	form	manner.  Is	it	really	necessary	to	write	GET	and	POST	in	separate	methods?	No!   A	simple	GET POST	request  An	amalgamation	of	both	GET	and	POST	into	a	single	view	function	can	be	written	as shown	below:  @app.route ' a-request',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	some_request  :	 				if	request.method	==	'GET':	 								bar	=	request.args.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 				else:	 								bar	=	request.form.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 				return	'A	simple	Flask	request	where	foo	is	%s'	%	bar	   How	it	works...  Let's	try	to	understand	how	the	preceding	play	of	methods	work.  By	default,	any	Flask	view	function	supports	only	GET	requests.	In	order	to	support or	handle	any	other	kind	of	request,	we	have	to	specifically	tell	our	route   decorator	about	the	methods	we	want	to	support.	This	is	precisely	what	we	did	in our	last	two	methods	for	POST	and	GET POST.  For	GET	requests,	the	request	object	will	look	for	args,	that	is,	request.args.get  ,	and for	POST,	it	will	look	for	form,	that	is,	request.form.get  .  Also,	if	we	try	to	make	a	GET	request	to	a	method	that	supports	only	POST,	the request	will	fail	with	a	405	HTTP	error.	The	same	holds	true	for	all	the	methods. Refer	to	the	following	screenshot:   There's	more...  Sometimes,	we	might	want	to	have	a	URL	map	kind	of	a	pattern,	where	we prefer	to	define	all	the	URL	rules	with	endpoints	at	a	single	place	rather	than them	being	scattered	all	around	the	application.	For	this,	we	will	need	to	define our	methods	without	the	route  	decorator	and	define	the	route	on	our	application object,	as	shown	here:  def	get_request  :	 				bar	=	request.args.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 				return	'A	simple	Flask	request	where	foo	is	%s'	%	bar	 	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 app.add_url_rule ' a-get-request',	view_func=get_request 	  Make	sure	that	you	give	the	correct	relative	path	to	the	method	assigned	to view_func.   Writing	class-based	views  Flask	introduced	the	concept	of	pluggable	views	in	version	0.7;	this	added	a	lot of	flexibility	to	the	existing	implementation.	We	can	write	views	in	the	form	of classes;	these	views	can	be	written	in	a	generic	fashion	and	allow	for	an	easy	and understandable	inheritance.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	understand	how	to	create	such class-based	views.   Getting	ready  Refer	to	the	last	recipe,	Writing	function-based	views	and	URL	routes,	to	see	the basic	function-based	views	first.   How	to	do	it...  Flask	provides	a	class	named	View,	which	can	be	inherited	to	add	our	custom behavior.  The	following	is	an	example	of	a	simple	GET	request:  from	flask.views	import	View	 	 class	GetRequest View :	 	 				def	dispatch_request self :	 								bar	=	request.args.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 								return	'A	simple	Flask	request	where	foo	is	%s'	%	bar	 	 app.add_url_rule 	 				' a-get-request',	view_func=GetRequest.as_view 'get_request' 	  	  To	accommodate	both	GET	and	POST	requests,	we	can	write	the	following	code:  from	flask.views	import	View	 	 class	GetPostRequest View :	 				methods	=	['GET',	'POST']	 	 				def	dispatch_request self :	 								if	request.method	==	'GET':	 												bar	=	request.args.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 								if	request.method	==	'POST':	 												bar	=	request.form.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 								return	'A	simple	Flask	request	where	foo	is	%s'	%	bar	 	 app.add_url_rule 	 				' a-request',	 				view_func=GetPostRequest.as_view 'a_request' 	  	   How	it	works...  We	know	that	by	default,	any	Flask	view	function	supports	only	GET	requests.	The same	applies	to	class-based	views.	In	order	to	support	or	handle	any	other	kind of	request,	we	have	to	specifically	tell	our	class,	via	a	class	attribute	called methods,	about	the	HTTP	methods	we	want	to	support.	This	is	exactly	what	we	did	in our	last	example	of	GET POST	requests.  For	GET	requests,	the	request	object	will	look	for	args,	that	is,	request.args.get  ,	and for	POST,	it	will	look	for	form,	that	is,	request.form.get  .  Also,	if	we	try	to	make	a	GET	request	to	a	method	that	supports	only	POST,	the request	will	fail	with	a	405	HTTP	error.	The	same	holds	true	for	all	the	methods.   There's	more...  Now,	many	of	us	may	be	considering	whether	it	would	be	possible	to	just declare	GET	and	POST	methods	inside	a	View	class	and	let	Flask	handle	the	rest	of	the stuff.	The	answer	to	this	question	is	MethodView.	Let's	write	our	previous	snippet using	MethodView:  from	flask.views	import	MethodView	 class	GetPostRequest MethodView :	 	 				def	get self :	 								bar	=	request.args.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 								return	'A	simple	Flask	request	where	foo	is	%s'	%	bar	 	 				def	post self :	 								bar	=	request.form.get 'foo',	'bar' 	 								return	'A	simple	Flask	request	where	foo	is	%s'	%	bar	 	 app.add_url_rule 	 				' a-request',	 				view_func=GetPostRequest.as_view 'a_request' 	  	   See	also  Refer	to	the	previous	recipe,	Writing	function-based	views	and	URL	routes,	to understand	the	contrast	between	class-and	function-based	views.   Implementing	URL	routing	and product-based	pagination  At	times,	we	may	encounter	a	problem	where	we	have	to	parse	the	various	parts of	a	URL	differently.	For	example,	our	URL	can	have	an	integer	part,	a	string part,	a	string	part	of	a	specific	length,	and	slashes	in	the	URL.	We	can	parse	all these	combinations	in	our	URLs	using	URL	converters.	In	this	recipe,	we	will see	how	to	do	this.	Also,	we	will	learn	how	to	implement	pagination	using	the Flask-SQLAlchemy	extension.   Getting	ready  We	have	already	seen	several	instances	of	basic	URL	converters	in	this	book.	In this	recipe,	we	will	look	at	some	advanced	URL	converters	and	learn	how	to	use them.   How	to	do	it...  Let's	say	we	have	a	URL	route	defined	as	follows:  @app.route ' test  ' 	 def	get_name name :	 				return	name	  Here,	the	URL,	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 test Shalabh,	will	result	in	Shalabh	being	parsed and	passed	in	the	name	argument	of	the	get_name	method.	This	is	a	Unicode	or string	converter,	which	is	the	default	one	and	need	not	be	specified	explicitly.  We	can	also	have	strings	with	specific	lengths.	Let's	say	we	want	to	parse	a	URL that	may	contain	a	country	code	or	currency	code.	Country	codes	are	usually	two characters	long,	and	currency	codes	are	three	characters	long.	This	can	be	done as	follows:  @app.route ' test  ' 	 def	get_name code :	 				return	code	  This	will	match	both	US	and	USD	in	the	URL;	that	is, http:  127.0.0.1:5000 test USD	and	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 test US	will	be	treated similarly.	We	can	also	match	the	exact	length	using	the	length	parameter	instead of	minlength	and	maxlength.  We	can	also	parse	integer	values	in	a	similar	fashion:  @app.route ' test  ' 	 def	get_age age :	 				return	str age 	  We	can	also	specify	the	minimum	and	maximum	values	that	can	be	accepted. For	example,	we	can	have	@app.route ' test  ' .	We	can	also parse	float	values	using	float	in	place	of	int	in	the	preceding	example.   Adding	pagination	to	applications  In	the	Creating	a	basic	product	model	recipe	in	Chapter	3,	Data	Modeling	in Flask,	we	created	a	handler	to	list	all	the	products	in	our	database.	If	we	have thousands	of	products,	then	generating	a	list	of	all	of	these	products	in	one	go can	take	a	lot	of	time.	Also,	if	we	have	to	render	these	products	on	a	template, then	we	would	not	want	to	show	more	than	10-20	products	on	a	page	in	one	go. Pagination	proves	to	be	of	great	help	in	building	great	applications.  Let's	modify	the	products  	method	to	list	products	to	support	pagination:  @catalog.route ' products' 	 @catalog.route ' products  ' 	 def	products page=1 :	 				products	=	Product.query.paginate page,	10 .items	 				res	=	{}	 				for	product	in	products:	 								res[product.id]	=	{	 												'name':	product.name,	 												'price':	product.price,	 												'category':	product.category.name	 								}	 				return	jsonify res 	  In	the	preceding	handler,	we	added	a	new	URL	route	that	adds	a	page	parameter to	the	URL.	Now,	the	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 products	URL	will	be	the	same	as http:  127.0.0.1:5000 products 1,	and	both	will	return	a	list	of	the	first	10	products from	the	database.	The	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 products 2	URL	will	return	the	next	10 products	and	so	on.  The	paginate  	method	takes	three	arguments	and	returns	an	object	of	the	Pagination	class. These	three	arguments	are	as	follows:  page:	This	is	the	current	page	to	be	listed. per_page:	This	is	the	number	of	items	to	be	listed	per	page. error_out:	If	no	items	are	found	for	the	page,	then	this	aborts	with	a	404	error. To	prevent	this	behavior,	set	this	parameter	to	False,	and	then,	it	will	just return	an	empty	list.   See	also  Refer	to	the	Creating	a	basic	product	model	recipe	in	Chapter	3,	Data	Modeling	in Flask,	to	understand	the	context	of	this	recipe	for	pagination.   Rendering	to	templates  After	writing	the	views,	we	will	surely	want	to	render	the	content	on	a	template and	get	information	from	the	underlying	database.   Getting	ready  To	render	to	templates,	we	will	use	Jinja2	as	the	templating	language.	Refer	to	Ch apter	2,	Templating	with	Jinja2,	to	understand	templating	in	depth.   How	to	do	it...  We	will	again	work	in	reference	to	our	existing	catalog	application	from	the previous	recipe.	Let's	modify	our	views	to	render	templates	and	then	display	data from	the	database	in	these	templates.  The	following	is	the	modified	views.py	code	and	the	templates.	The	complete	app can	be	downloaded	from	the	code	bundle	provided	with	this	book.  We	will	start	by	modifying	our	views,	that	is, flask_catalog_template my_app catalog views.py,	to	render	templates	on	specific handlers:  from	flask	import	render_template	 	 @catalog.route ' ' 	 @catalog.route ' home' 	 def	home  :	 				return	render_template 'home.html' 	  Notice	the	render_template  	method.	This	method	will	render	home.html	when	the home	handler	is	called.  The	method	below	handles	the	rendering	of	product.html	with	the	product	object	in template	context:  @catalog.route ' product  ' 	 def	product id :	 				product	=	Product.query.get_or_404 id 	 				return	render_template 'product.html',	product=product 	  To	get	the	list	of	all	products	see	the	method	below:  @catalog.route ' products' 	 @catalog.route ' products  ' 	 def	products page=1 :	 				products	=	Product.query.paginate page,	10 	 				return	render_template 'products.html',	products=products 	  Here,	the	products.html	template	will	be	rendered	with	the	list	of	paginated	product objects	in	the	context.  To	render	the	product	template	on	creation	of	a	new	product,	the   create_product  	method	can	be	modified	as	shown	below:  @catalog.route ' product-create',	methods=['POST',] 	 def	create_product  :	 					...	Same	code	as	before	...	 				return	render_template 'product.html',	product=product 	  This	can	also	be	done	using	redirect  ,	but	we	will	cover	this	at	a	later	stage. Have	a	look	at	the	following	code:  @catalog.route ' category-create',	methods=['POST',] 	 def	create_category  :	 					...	Same	code	as	before	...	 				return	render_template 'category.html',	category=category 	 	 	 @catalog.route ' category  ' 	 def	category id :	 				category	=	Category.query.get_or_404 id 	 				return	render_template 'category.html',	category=category 	 	 	 @catalog.route ' categories' 	 def	categories  :	 				categories	=	Category.query.all  	 				return	render_template 'categories.html',	 							categories=categories 	  All	three	handlers	in	the	preceding	code	work	in	a	similar	way	as	discussed earlier	with	regard	to	rendering	the	product-related	templates.  The	following	are	all	the	templates	created	and	rendered	as	part	of	the application.	For	more	information	on	how	these	templates	are	written	and	how they	work,	refer	to	Chapter	2,	Templating	with	Jinja2.  The	first	template	file	is	flask_catalog_template my_app templates home.html,	as	follows:      		  				  				  				  				 Flask	Framework	Cookbook  				  				  		  		  				  						  								  										 Flask	Cookbook  								  						  				    				  				  				{%	block	container	%}{%	endblock	%} 				  	 				  				   				   		     The	flask_catalog_template my_app templates home.html	file	appears	as	follows:  {%	extends	'base.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 Welcome	to	the	Catalog	Home 	 		 Click	here	to	see	 					the	catalog 	 {%	endblock	%}	  The	flask_catalog_template my_app templates product.html	file	appears	as	follows:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				 {{	product.name	}} 	{{	product.category.name	 							}}  	 				 {{	product.price	}} 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  The	flask_catalog_template my_app templates products.html	file	appears	as	follows:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				{%	for	product	in	products.items	%}	 						 	 								 	 										<a	href="{{	url_for 'catalog.product',	id=product.id 	 													}}">{{	product.name	}} 	 										 $	{{	product.price	}} 	 								 	 						 	 				{%	endfor	%}	 				{%	if	products.has_prev	%}	 						 	 								{{"<<	Previous	Page"}}	 						 	 				{%	else	%}	 						{{"<<	Previous	Page"}}	 				{%	endif	%}		 				{%	if	products.has_next	%}	 						 	 								{{"Next	page	>>"}}	 						 	 				{%	else	%}	 						{{"Next	page	>>"}}	   						{{"Next	page	>>"}}	 				{%	endif	%}	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  Note	how	the	URL	is	being	created	for	the	Previous	page	and	Next	page	links. We	are	using	request.endpoint	so	that	the	pagination	works	on	the	current	URL, which	will	make	the	template	reusable	with	search	as	well.	We	will	see	this	later in	this	chapter.  The	flask_catalog_template my_app templates category.html	file	appears	as	follows:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				 {{	category.name	}} 	 				 	 						{%	for	product	in	category.products	%}	 								 	 										  										{{	product.name	}} 	 										 $	{{	product.price	}} 	 								 	 						{%	endfor	%}	 				 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				{%	for	category	in	categories	%}	 				 	 						 {{	category.name	}} 	 				 	 				{%	endfor	%}	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  The	flask_catalog_template my_app templates categories.html	file	appears	as	follows:   How	it	works...  Our	view	methods	have	a	render_template	method	call	at	the	end.	This	means	that following	successful	completion	of	the	method	operations,	we	will	render	a template	with	some	parameters	added	to	the	context.  Note	how	pagination	has	been	implemented	in	the	products.html	file.	It	can	be	improved further	to	show	the	page	numbers	as	well	between	the	two	links	for	navigation.	This	should	be undertaken	by	readers	on	their	own.   See	also  Refer	to	the	Implementing	URL	routing	and	product-based	pagination	recipe	to understand	pagination	and	the	remainder	of	the	application	used	in	this	recipe.   Dealing	with	XHR	requests Asynchronous	JavaScript	XMLHttpRequest	 XHR ,	commonly	known	as Ajax,	has	become	an	important	part	of	web	applications	over	the	last	few	years. With	the	advent	of	single-page	applications	and	JavaScript	application frameworks	such	as	Angular,	Vue,	and	React,	this	technique	of	web development	has	risen	exponentially.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	implement	an Ajax	request	to	facilitate	asynchronous	communication	between	the	backend	and frontend.   Getting	ready  Flask	provides	an	easy	way	to	handle	the	XHR	requests	in	the	view	handlers. We	can	even	have	common	methods	for	normal	web	requests	and	XHRs.	We can	just	check	for	a	flag	on	our	request	object	to	determine	the	type	of	call	and	act accordingly.  We	will	update	the	catalog	application	from	the	previous	recipe	to	have	a	feature to	demonstrate	XHR	requests.   How	to	do	it...  The	Flask	request	object	has	a	flag	called	is_xhr,	which	tells	us	whether	the request	made	is	an	XHR	request	or	a	simple	web	request.	Usually,	when	we	have an	XHR	request,	the	caller	expects	the	result	to	be	in	JSON	format,	which	can then	be	used	to	render	content	in	the	correct	place	on	the	web	page	without reloading	the	page.  So,	let's	say	we	have	an	Ajax	call	to	fetch	the	number	of	products	in	the	database on	the	home	page	itself.	One	way	to	fetch	the	products	is	to	send	the	count	of products	along	with	the	render_template  	context.	Another	way	is	to	send	this information	over	as	the	response	to	an	Ajax	call.	We	will	implement	the	latter	to see	how	Flask	handles	XHR:  from	flask	import	request,	render_template,	jsonify	 	 @catalog.route ' ' 	 @catalog.route ' home' 	 def	home  :	 				if	request.is_xhr:	 								products	=	Product.query.all  	 								return	jsonify {	 												'count':	len products 	 								} 	 				return	render_template 'home.html' 	  This	design	of	handling	XHR	and	regular	requests	together	in	one	method	can	become	a	bit bloated	as	the	application	grows	in	size	and	different	logic	handling	has	to	be	executed	in	the case	of	XHR	as	compared	to	regular	requests.	In	such	cases,	these	two	types	of	requests	can be	separated	into	different	methods	where	the	handling	of	XHR	is	done	separately	from regular	requests.	This	can	even	be	extended	to	have	different	blueprints	to	make	URL handling	even	cleaner.  In	the	preceding	method,	we	first	checked	whether	this	is	an	XHR.	If	it	is,	we return	the	JSON	data;	otherwise,	we	just	render	home.html,	as	we	have	done hitherto.  Next,	modify	flask_catalog_template my_app templates base.html	to	a	block	for	scripts. This	empty	block,	which	is	shown	here,	can	be	placed	after	the	line	where	the Bootstrap.js	script	is	included:  {%	block	scripts	%}	 	 	 {%	endblock	%}	   {%	endblock	%}	  Next,	we	have	flask_catalog_template my_app templates home.html,	where	we	send	an Ajax	call	to	the	home  	handler,	which	checks	whether	the	request	is	an	XHR request.	If	it	is,	it	fetches	the	count	of	products	from	the	database	and	returns	it as	a	JSON	object.	Check	the	code	inside	the	scripts	block:  {%	extends	'base.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 Welcome	to	the	Catalog	Home 	 		 	 				Click	here	to	see	the	catalog	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	 	 {%	block	scripts	%}	  	 $ document .ready function  {	 		$.getJSON " home",	function data 	{	 				$ 'catalog_link' .append ' '	+	data.count	 							+	' ' ;	 		} ;	 } ;	  	 {%	endblock	%}	   How	it	works...  Now,	our	home	page	contains	a	badge,	which	shows	the	number	of	products	in the	database.	This	badge	will	load	only	after	the	whole	page	has	loaded.	The difference	in	the	loading	of	the	badge	and	the	other	content	on	the	page	will	be notable	when	the	database	has	a	substantially	high	number	of	products.  The	following	is	a	screenshot	that	shows	what	the	home	page	looks	like	now:   Using	decorators	to	handle	requests beautifully  Some	of	us	may	believe	that	checking	every	time	whether	a	request	is	XHR	kills code	readability.	To	solve	this,	we	have	an	easy	solution.	In	this	recipe,	we	will write	a	simple	decorator	that	can	handle	this	redundant	code	for	us.   Getting	ready  In	this	recipe,	we	will	be	writing	a	decorator.	For	some	Python	beginners,	this might	seem	like	alien	territory.	In	this	case,	read	http:  legacy.python.org dev peps p ep-0318 	for	a	better	understanding	of	decorators.   How	to	do	it...  The	following	is	the	decorator	method	that	we	have	written	for	this	recipe:  from	functools	import	wraps	 	 def	template_or_json template=None :	 				""""Return	a	dict	from	your	view	and	this	will	either	 				pass	it	to	a	template	or	render	json.	Use	like:	 		 				@template_or_json 'template.html' 	 				"""	 				def	decorated f :	 								@wraps f 	 								def	decorated_fn *args,	**kwargs :	 												ctx	=	f *args,	**kwargs 	 												if	request.is_xhr	or	not	template:	 																return	jsonify ctx 	 												else:	 																return	render_template template,	**ctx 	 								return	decorated_fn	 				return	decorated	  This	decorator	simply	does	what	we	did	in	the	previous	recipe	to	handle	XHR; that	is,	checking	whether	our	request	is	XHR	and,	based	on	the	outcome,	either rendering	the	template	or	returning	JSON	data.  Now,	let's	apply	this	decorator	to	our	home  	method,	which	handled	the	XHR	call in	the	last	recipe:  @app.route ' ' 	 @app.route ' home' 	 @template_or_json 'home.html' 	 def	home  :	 				products	=	Product.query.all  	 				return	{'count':	len products }	   See	also  Refer	to	the	Dealing	with	XHR	requests	recipe	to	understand	how	this	recipe changes	the	coding	pattern.	The	reference	for	this	recipe	comes	from	http:  justin donato.com notebook template-or-json-decorator-for-flask.html.   Creating	custom	404	and	500 handlers  Every	application	throws	errors	to	users	at	some	point	in	time.	These	errors	can be	due	to	the	user	typing	a	non-existent	URL	 404 ,	application	overload	 500 , or	something	forbidden	for	a	certain	user	to	access	 403 .	A	good	application handles	these	errors	in	a	user-interactive	way	instead	of	showing	an	ugly	white page,	which	makes	no	sense	to	most	users.	Flask	provides	an	easy-to-use decorator	to	handle	these	errors.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	understand	how	we	can leverage	this	decorator.   Getting	ready  The	Flask	app	object	has	a	method	called	errorhandler  ,	which	enables	us	to handle	our	application's	errors	in	a	much	more	beautiful	and	efficient	manner.   How	to	do	it...  Create	a	method	that	is	decorated	with	errorhandler  	and	renders	the 404.html	template	whenever	the	404	Not	Found	error	occurs:  @app.errorhandler 404 	 def	page_not_found e :	 				return	render_template '404.html' ,	404	  The	following	lines	of	code	represent	the flask_catalog_template my_app templates 404.html	template,	which	is	rendered	in	case of	404	errors:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				 Hola	Friend!	Looks	like	in	your	quest	you	have	reached	a	 							location	which	does	not	exist	yet. 	 				 To	continue,	either	check	your	map	location	 URL 	or	go	 							back	 home  	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	   How	it	works...  So,	now,	if	we	open	an	incorrect	URL,	for	example,	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 i-am-lost, then	we	will	get	the	screen	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:  Similarly,	we	can	add	more	error	handlers	for	other	error	codes	too.   There's	more...  It	is	also	possible	to	create	custom	errors	as	per	the	application	requirements	and bind	them	to	error	codes	and	custom	error	screens.	This	can	be	done	as	follows:  class	MyCustom404 Exception :	 				pass	 	 @app.errorhandler MyCustom404 	 def	special_page_not_found error :	 				return	render_template "errors custom_404.html" ,	404	   Flashing	messages	for	better	user feedback  An	important	aspect	of	all	good	web	applications	is	to	give	users	feedback regarding	various	activities.	For	example,	when	a	user	creates	a	product	and	is redirected	to	the	newly	created	product,	then	it	is	good	practice	to	tell	the	user that	the	product	has	been	created.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	see	how	flashing messages	can	be	used	as	a	good	feedback	mechanism	for	users.   Getting	ready  We	will	start	by	adding	the	flash	messages'	functionality	to	our	existing	catalog application.	We	also	have	to	make	sure	that	we	add	a	secret	key	to	the application,	because	the	session	depends	on	the	secret	key,	and,	in	the	absence	of the	secret	key,	the	application	will	error	out	while	flashing.   How	to	do	it...  To	demonstrate	the	flashing	of	messages,	we	will	flash	messages	upon	the product's	creation.  First,	we	will	add	a	secret	key	to	our	app	configuration	in flask_catalog_template my_app __init__.py:  app.secret_key	=	'some_random_key'	  Now,	we	will	modify	our	create_product  	handler	in flask_catalog_template my_app catalog views.py	to	flash	a	message	to	the	user regarding	the	product's	creation.  Also,	a	small	change	has	been	made	to	this	handler;	now,	it	will	be	possible	to create	the	product	from	a	web	interface	using	a	form:  from	flask	import	flash,	redirect,	url_for	 	 @catalog.route ' product-create',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	create_product  :	 				if	request.method	==	'POST':	 								name	=	request.form.get 'name' 	 								price	=	request.form.get 'price' 	 								categ_name	=	request.form.get 'category' 	 								category	=	Category.query.filter_by 											 name=categ_name .first  	 								if	not	category:	 												category	=	Category categ_name 	 								product	=	Product name,	price,	category 	 								db.session.add product 	 								db.session.commit  	 								flash 'The	product	%s	has	been	created'	%	name,	'success' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'catalog.product',	id=product.id  	 				return	render_template 'product-create.html' 	  In	the	preceding	method,	we	first	checked	whether	the	request	type	is	POST.	If	yes, then	we	proceed	to	product	creation	as	always,	or	render	the	page	with	a	form	to create	a	new	product.	Also,	notice	the	flash	statement	that	will	alert	the	user	in the	event	of	the	successful	creation	of	a	product.	The	first	argument	to	flash  	is the	message	to	be	displayed,	and	the	second	is	the	category	of	the	message.	We can	use	any	identifier	as	is	suitable	in	the	message	category.	This	can	be	used later	to	determine	the	type	of	alert	message	to	be	shown.   A	new	template	is	added;	this	holds	the	code	for	the	product	form.	The	path	of the	template	will	be	flask_catalog_template my_app templates product-create.html:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				<form	 								class="form-horizontal"	 								method="POST"	 								action="{{	url_for 'catalog.create_product' 	}}"	 								role="form">	 						 	 								<label	for="name"	class="col-sm-2	control- 											label">Name 	 								 	 										<input	type="text"	class="form-control"	id="name"	 													name="name">	 								 	 						 	 						 	 								<label	for="price"	class="col-sm-2	control- 											label">Price 	 								 	 										<input	type="number"	class="form-control"	id="price"	 													name="price">	 								 	 						 	 						 	 								<label	for="category"	class="col-sm-2	control- 											label">Category 	 								 	 										<input	type="text"	class="form-control"	id="category"	 													name="category">	 								 	 						 	 						<button	type="submit"	class="btn	btn- 									default">Submit 	 				 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  We	will	also	modify	our	base	template,	that	is, flask_catalog_template my_app templates base.html,	to	accommodate	flashed	messages. Just	add	the	following	lines	of	code	inside	the	 	container	before	the	container block:   	  	 		{%	for	category,	message	in	get_flashed_messages 					 with_categories=true 	%}	 				 	 						<button	type="button"	class="close"	data-dismiss="alert"	 									aria-hidden="true">&times; 	 						{{	message	}}	 				 	 		{%	endfor	%}	  	   Notice	that	in	the	 	container,	we	have	added	a	mechanism	to	show	a	flashed	message	that fetches	the	flashed	messages	in	the	template	using	get_flashed_messages  .   How	it	works...  A	form	like	the	one	shown	in	the	following	screenshot	will	show	up	upon moving	to	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product-create:  Fill	in	the	form	and	click	on	Submit.	This	will	lead	to	the	usual	product	page with	an	alert	message	at	the	top:   Implementing	SQL-based	searching  In	any	web	application,	it	is	important	to	be	able	to	search	the	database	for records	based	on	certain	criteria.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	go	through	how	to implement	basic	SQL-based	searching	in	SQLAlchemy.	The	same	principle	can be	used	to	search	any	other	database	system.   Getting	ready  We	have	been	implementing	some	level	of	search	in	our	catalog	application from	the	beginning.	Whenever	we	show	the	product	page,	we	search	for	a specific	product	using	its	ID.	We	will	now	take	it	to	a	slightly	more	advanced level	and	search	on	the	basis	of	name	and	category.   How	to	do	it...  The	following	is	a	method	that	searches	in	our	catalog	application	for	name, price,	company,	and	category.	We	can	search	for	any	one	criterion,	or	multiple criteria	 except	for	the	last	search	on	category,	which	can	only	be	searched alone .	Notice	that	we	have	different	expressions	for	different	values.	For	a	float value	in	price,	we	can	search	for	equality,	and	in	the	case	of	a	string,	we	can search	using	like.	Also,	carefully	note	how	join	is	implemented	in	the	case	of category.	Place	this	method	in	the	views	file,	that	is, flask_catalog_template my_app catalog views.py:  from	sqlalchemy.orm.util	import	join	 	 @catalog.route ' product-search' 	 @catalog.route ' product-search  ' 	 def	product_search page=1 :	 				name	=	request.args.get 'name' 	 				price	=	request.args.get 'price' 	 				company	=	request.args.get 'company' 	 				category	=	request.args.get 'category' 	 				products	=	Product.query	 				if	name:	 								products	=	products.filter Product.name.like '%'	+	name	+	 											'%'  	 				if	price:	 								products	=	products.filter Product.price	==	price 	 				if	company:	 								products	=	products.filter Product.company.like '%'	+	 											company	+	'%'  	 				if	category:	 								products	=	products.select_from join Product,	 											Category  .filter 	 												Category.name.like '%'	+	category	+	'%' 	 								 	 				return	render_template 	 								'products.html',	products=products.paginate page,	10 	 				 	   How	it	works...  We	can	search	for	products	by	entering	a	URL,	something	like http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product-search?name=iPhone.	This	will	search	for	products	with the	name	iPhone,	and	list	the	results	on	the	products.html	template.	Similarly,	we can	search	for	price	and or	company	or	category	as	required.	Try	various combinations	by	yourself	to	aid	your	understanding.  We	have	used	the	same	product	list	page	to	render	our	search	results.	It	will	be	interesting	to implement	the	search	using	Ajax.	I	will	leave	this	you	to	implement	by	yourself.   Webforms	with	WTForms  Form	handling	is	an	integral	part	of	any	web	application.	There	can	be innumerable	cases	that	make	the	presence	of	forms	in	any	web	app	very important.	Some	cases	may	include	situations	where	users	need	to	log	in	or submit	some	data	or	cases	where	applications	might	require	inputs	from	users. As	much	as	the	forms	are	important,	their	validation	holds	equal	importance,	if not	more.	Presenting	this	information	to	users	in	an	interactive	fashion	adds	a	lot of	value	to	the	application.  There	are	various	ways	in	which	we	can	design	and	implement	forms	in	a	web application.	With	the	advent	of	Web	2.0,	form	validation	and	communicating	the correct	messages	to	the	user	have	become	very	important.	Client-side	validations can	be	implemented	at	the	frontend	using	JavaScript	and	HTML5.	Server-side validations	have	a	more	important	role	in	adding	security	to	the	application, rather	than	being	user-interactive.	Server-side	validations	prevent	any	wrong data	from	going	through	to	the	database	and,	hence,	curb	frauds	and	attacks.  WTForms	provides	many	fields	with	server-side	validation	by	default	and, hence,	increases	the	development	speed	and	decreases	the	overall	effort	required. It	also	provides	the	flexibility	to	write	custom	validations	and	custom	fields	as required.  We	will	use	a	Flask	extension	for	this	chapter.	This	extension	is	called	Flask- WTF	 https:  flask-wtf.readthedocs.org en latest  ;	it	provides	an	integration between	WTForms	and	Flask,	and	takes	care	of	important	and	trivial	stuff	that we	would	have	to	otherwise	reinvent	in	order	to	make	our	application	secure	and effective.	We	can	install	it	using	the	following	command:  $	pip3	install	Flask-WTF		  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Representing	SQLAlchemy	model	data	as	a	form Validating	fields	on	the	server	side Creating	a	common	forms	set   Creating	custom	fields	and	validation Creating	a	custom	widget Uploading	files	via	forms Protecting	applications	from	cross-site	request	forgery	 CSRF    Representing	SQLAlchemy	model data	as	a	form  First,	let's	build	a	form	using	a	SQLAlchemy	model.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	take the	product	model	from	our	catalog	application	and	add	the	functionality	to create	products	from	the	frontend	using	a	webform.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	our	catalog	application	from	Chapter	4,	Working	with	Views,	and	we will	develop	a	form	for	the	Product	model.   How	to	do	it...  If	you	recall,	the	Product	model	looks	like	the	following	lines	of	code	in	the models.py	file:  class	Product db.Model :	 				id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	primary_key=True 	 				name	=	db.Column db.String 255  	 				price	=	db.Column db.Float 	 				category_id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	 							db.ForeignKey 'category.id'  	 				category	=	db.relationship 	 								'Category',	backref=db.backref 'products',	lazy='dynamic' 	 				 	  First,	we	will	create	a	ProductForm	class	in	models.py;	this	will	subclass	the	FlaskForm class,	which	is	provided	by	flask_wtf,	to	represent	the	fields	required	on	a webform:  from	flask_wtf	import	FlaskForm	 from	wtforms	import	StringField,	DecimalField,	SelectField	 	 class	ProductForm FlaskForm :	 				name	=	StringField 'Name' 	 				price	=	DecimalField 'Price' 	 				category	=	SelectField 'Category',	coerce=int 	  We	import	FlaskForm	from	the	flask-wtf	extension.	Everything	else,	such	as	fields and	validators,	are	imported	from	wtforms	directly.	The	Name	field	is	of	the StringField	type,	as	it	requires	text	data,	while	Price	is	of	the	DecimalField	type, which	will	parse	the	data	to	Python's	Decimal	data	type.	We	have	kept	Category	as the	SelectField	type,	which	means	that	we	can	choose	only	from	the	categories created	previously	when	creating	a	product.  Note	that	we	have	a	parameter	called	coerce	in	the	field	definition	for	Category	 which	is	a selection	list ;	this	means	that	the	incoming	data	from	the	HTML	form	will	be	coerced	to	an integer	value	prior	to	validating	or	any	other	processing.	Here,	coercing	simply	means converting	a	value,	provided	in	a	specific	data	type,	to	a	different	data	type.  The	create_product  	handler	in	views.py	should	now	accommodate	the	form	created earlier:  from	my_app.catalog.models	import	ProductForm	 	 @catalog.route ' product-create',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	create_product  :	   def	create_product  :	 				form	=	ProductForm csrf_enabled=False 	 	 				categories	=	[ c.id,	c.name 	for	c	in	Category.query.all  ]	 				form.category.choices	=	categories	 	 				if	request.method	==	'POST':	 								name	=	form.name.data	 								price	=	form.price.data	 								category	=	Category.query.get_or_404 	 												form.category.data	 								 	 								product	=	Product name,	price,	category 	 								db.session.add product 	 								db.session.commit  	 								flash 'The	product	%s	has	been	created'	%	name,	'success' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'catalog.product',	id=product.id  	 				return	render_template 'product-create.html',	form=form 	  The	create_product  	method	accepts	values	from	a	form	on	a	POST	request.	This method	will	render	an	empty	form	with	the	prefilled	choices	in	the	Category	field on	a	GET	request.	On	the	POST	request,	the	form	data	will	be	used	to	create	a	new product,	and	when	the	creation	of	the	product	is	completed,	the	newly	created product's	page	will	be	displayed.  You	will	notice	that	while	creating	the	form	object	as	form	=	ProductForm csrf_enabled=False ,	we set	csrf_enabled	to	False.	CSRF	is	an	important	part	of	any	secure	web	application.	We	will talk	about	this	in	detail	in	the	Protecting	applications	from	cross-site	request	forgery  CSRF 	recipe	of	this	chapter.  The	templates product-create.html	template	also	requires	some	modification.	The form	objects	created	by	WTForms	provide	an	easy	way	to	create	HTML	forms and	keep	the	code	readable:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				<form	method="POST"	action="{{	 							url_for 'catalog.create_product' 	}}"	role="form">	 						 {{	form.name.label	}}:	{{	 									form.name  	}} 	 						 {{	form.price.label	}}:	{{	 									form.price  	}} 	 						 {{	form.category.label	}}:	{{	 									form.category  	}} 	 						<button	type="submit"	class="btn	btn- 									default">Submit 	 				 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	   How	it	works...  On	a	GET	request,	that	is,	upon	opening	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product-create,	we	will see	a	form	similar	to	the	one	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:  You	can	fill	in	this	form	to	create	a	new	product.   See	also  Refer	to	the	following		Validating	fields	on	the	server	side	recipe	to	understand how	to	validate	the	fields	we	just	learned	to	create.   Validating	fields	on	the	server	side  We	have	forms	and	fields,	but	we	need	to	validate	them	in	order	to	make	sure that	only	the	correct	data	goes	through	to	the	database,	and	that	errors	are handled	beforehand,	rather	than	corrupting	the	database.	These	validations	can also	prevent	the	application	against	cross-site	scripting	 XSS 	and CSRF	attacks.	WTForms	provides	a	whole	lot	of	field	types	that	themselves have	validations	written	for	them	by	default.	Apart	from	these,	there	are	a	bunch of	validators	that	can	be	used	on	the	basis	of	choice	and	need.	In	this	recipe,	we will	use	a	few	of	them	to	understand	the	concept.   How	to	do	it...  It	is	pretty	easy	to	add	validations	to	our	WTForm	fields.	We	just	need	to	pass	a validators	parameter,	which	accepts	a	list	of	validators	to	be	implemented.	Each of	the	validators	can	have	their	own	arguments,	which	enables	us	to	control	the validations	to	a	great	extent.  Let's	modify	our	ProductForm	object	in	the	models.py	class	to	have	validations:  from	decimal	import	Decimal	 from	wtforms.validators	import	InputRequired,	NumberRange	 	 class	ProductForm FlaskForm :	 				name	=	StringField 'Name',	validators=[InputRequired  ] 	 				price	=	DecimalField 'Price',	validators=[	 								InputRequired  ,	NumberRange min=Decimal '0.0'  	 				] 	 				category	=	SelectField 	 								'Category',	validators=[InputRequired  ],	coerce=int	 				 	  Here,	we	have	the	InputRequired	validator	on	all	three	fields;	this	means	that	these fields	are	required,	and	the	form	will	not	be	submitted	unless	we	have	values	for these	fields.  The	Price	field	has	an	additional	validator,	NumberRange,	with	a	min	parameter	set	to 0.0.	This	implies	that	we	cannot	have	a	value	of	less	than	0	as	the	price	of	a product.	To	complement	these	changes,	we	will	have	to	modify	our create_product  	method	in	views.py	somewhat:  @catalog.route ' product-create',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	create_product  :	 				form	=	ProductForm csrf_enabled=False 	 	 				categories	=	[ c.id,	c.name 	for	c	in	Category.query.all  ]	 				form.category.choices	=	categories	 	 				if	request.method	==	'POST'	and	form.validate  :	 								name	=	form.name.data	 								price	=	form.price.data	 								category	=	Category.query.get_or_404 	 												form.category.data	 								 	 								product	=	Product name,	price,	category 	 								db.session.add product 	 								db.session.commit  	 								flash 'The	product	%s	has	been	created'	%	name,	'success' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'product',	id=product.id  	 	   	 				if	form.errors:	 								flash form.errors,	'danger' 	 	 				return	render_template 'product-create.html',	form=form 	  The	flashing	of	form.errors	will	just	display	the	errors	in	the	form	of	a	JSON	object.	This	can be	formatted	to	be	shown	in	a	pleasing	format	to	the	user.	This	is	left	for	users	to	try	by themselves.  Here,	we	modified	our	create_product  	method	to	validate	the	form	for	the	input values	and	to	check	for	the	request	method	type.	Some	of	the	validations	will	be translated	and	applied	to	the	frontend	as	well,	just	like	the	InputRequired	validation will	add	a	required	property	to	the	form	field's	HTML.	On	a	POST	request,	the	form data	will	be	validated	first.	If	the	validation	fails	for	some	reason,	the	same	page will	be	rendered	again,	with	error	messages	flashed	on	it.	If	the	validation succeeds	and	the	creation	of	the	product	is	completed,	the	newly	created product's	page	will	be	displayed.   How	it	works...  Now,	try	to	submit	the	form	without	any	field	filled	in;	that	is,	an	empty	form. An	alert	message	with	an	error	will	be	shown	as	follows:  If	you	try	to	submit	the	form	with	a	negative	price	value,	the	error	flashed	will look	something	like	that	in	the	following	screenshot:   Try	different	combinations	of	form	submission	that	will	violate	the	defined validators,	and	see	the	different	error	messages	that	come	up.   There's	more...  We	can	replace	the	processes	of	checking	for	the	method	type	being	a	POST	or	PUT request,	and	form	validation,	with	a	single	step	using	validate_on_submit.	So,	the original	code	is	as	follows:  if	request.method	==	'POST'	and	form.validate  :	  This	can	be	replaced	by	the	following	command:  if	form.validate_on_submit  :	   See	also  Refer	to	the	previous	recipe,	Representing	SQLAlchemy	model	data	as	a	form,	to understand	basic	form	creation	using	WTForms.   Creating	a	common	forms	set  An	application	can	have	loads	of	forms,	depending	on	the	design	and	purpose. Many	of	these	forms	will	have	common	fields	with	common	validators.	Many	of us	may	think:	Why	not	have	common	forms	parts	and	then	reuse	them	as	and when	needed?	In	this	recipe,	we	will	see	that	this	is	certainly	possible	with	the class	structure	for	forms'	definition	provided	by	WTForms.   How	to	do	it...  In	our	catalog	application,	we	can	have	two	forms,	one	each	for	the	Product	and Category	models.	These	forms	will	have	a	common	field	called	Name.	We	can	create a	common	form	for	this	field,	and	then	the	separate	forms	for	the	Product	and Category	models	can	use	this	form,	instead	of	having	a	Name	field	in	each	of	them.  This	can	be	implemented	as	follows	in	models.py:  class	NameForm FlaskForm :	 				name	=	StringField 'Name',	validators=[InputRequired  ] 	 	 class	ProductForm NameForm :	 				price	=	DecimalField 'Price',	validators=[	 								InputRequired  ,	NumberRange min=Decimal '0.0'  	 				] 	 				category	=	SelectField 	 								'Category',	validators=[InputRequired  ],	coerce=int	 				 	 	 	 class	CategoryForm NameForm :	 				pass	  We	created	a	common	form	called	NameForm,	and	the	other	forms,	ProductForm	and CategoryForm,	inherit	from	this	form	to	have	a	field	called	Name	by	default.	Then,	we can	add	more	fields	as	necessary.  We	can	modify	the	category_create  	method	in	views.py	to	use	CategoryForm	to	create categories:  @catalog.route ' category-create',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	create_category  :	 				form	=	CategoryForm csrf_enabled=False 	 	 				if	form.validate_on_submit  :	 								name	=	form.name.data	 								category	=	Category name 	 								db.session.add category 	 								db.session.commit  	 								flash 'The	category	%s	has	been	created'	%	name,	 											'success' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'catalog.category',	 											id=category.id  	 	 				if	form.errors:	 								flash form.errors 	 	 				return	render_template 'category-create.html',	form=form 	   A	new	template,	templates category-create.html,	also	needs	to	be	added	for	category creation:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				<form	method="POST"	action="{{	 							url_for 'catalog.create_category' 	}}"	role="form">	 						 {{	form.name.label	}}:	{{	 									form.name  	}} 	 						<button	type="submit"	class="btn	btn- 									default">Submit 	 				 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	   How	it	works...  The	newly	created	category	form	will	look	like	the	following	screenshot:  This	is	a	very	small	example	of	how	a	common	forms	set	can	be	implemented.	The	actual benefits	of	this	approach	can	be	seen	in	e-commerce	applications,	where	we	can	have common	address	forms,	and	then,	they	can	be	expanded	to	have	separate	billing	and	shipping addresses.   Creating	custom	fields	and	validation  Apart	from	providing	a	bunch	of	fields	and	validations,	Flask	also	provides	the flexibility	to	create	custom	fields	and	validations.	Sometimes,	we	might	need	to parse	some	form	of	data	that	cannot	be	processed	using	the	available	current fields.	In	such	cases,	we	can	implement	our	own	fields.   How	to	do	it...  In	our	catalog	application,	we	used	SelectField	for	category,	and	we	populated	the values	for	this	field	in	our	create_product  	method	on	a	GET	request.	It	would	be much	more	convenient	if	we	did	not	concern	ourselves	with	this	and	the population	of	this	field	was	taken	care	of	by	itself.  Now,	let's	implement	a	custom	field	to	do	this	in	models.py:  class	CategoryField SelectField :	 	 				def	iter_choices self :	 								categories	=	[ c.id,	c.name 	for	c	in	 											Category.query.all  ]	 								for	value,	label	in	categories:	 												yield	 value,	label,	self.coerce value 	==	self.data 	 	 				def	pre_validate self,	form :	 								for	v,	_	in	[ c.id,	c.name 	for	c	in	 											Category.query.all  ]:	 												if	self.data	==	v:	 																break	 								else:	 												raise	ValueError self.gettext 'Not	a	valid	choice'  	 	 class	ProductForm NameForm :	 				price	=	DecimalField 'Price',	validators=[	 								InputRequired  ,	NumberRange min=Decimal '0.0'  	 				] 	 				category	=	CategoryField 	 								'Category',	validators=[InputRequired  ],	coerce=int	 				 	  SelectField	implements	a	method	called	iter_choices  ,	which	populates	the	values to	the	form	using	the	list	of	values	provided	to	the	choices	parameter.	We overwrote	the	iter_choices  	method	to	get	the	values	of	categories	directly	from the	database,	and	this	eliminates	the	need	to	populate	this	field	every	time	we need	to	use	this	form.  The	behavior	created	by	CategoryField	here	can	also	be	achieved	using	QuerySelectField.	Refer	to	 http:  wtforms.readthedocs.org en latest ext.htmlwtforms.ext.sqlalchemy.fields.QuerySelectField	for	more information.  Due	to	the	changes	described	in	this	section,	our	create_product  	method	in views.py	will	have	to	be	modified.	For	this,	just	remove	the	following	two statements	that	populated	the	categories	in	the	form:   categories	=	[ c.id,	c.name 	for	c	in	Category.query.all  ]	 form.category.choices	=	categories	   How	it	works...  There	will	not	be	any	visual	effect	on	the	application.	The	only	change	will	be	in the	way	the	categories	are	populated	in	the	form,	as	explained	in	the	previous section.   There's	more...  We	just	saw	how	to	write	custom	fields.	Similarly,	we	can	write	custom validations,	too.	Let's	assume	that	we	do	not	want	to	allow	duplicate	categories. We	can	implement	this	in	our	models	easily,	but	let's	do	this	using	a	custom validator	on	our	form:  from	wtforms.validators	import	ValidationError	 	 def	check_duplicate_category case_sensitive=True :	 				def	_check_duplicate form,	field :	 								if	case_sensitive:	 												res	=	Category.query.filter 	 																Category.name.like '%'	+	field.data	+	'%' 	 												 .first  	 								else:	 												res	=	Category.query.filter 	 																Category.name.ilike '%'	+	field.data	+	'%' 	 												 .first  	 								if	res:	 												raise	ValidationError 	 																'Category	named	%s	already	exists'	%	field.data	 												 	 				return	_check_duplicate	 	 class	CategoryForm NameForm :	 				name	=	StringField 'Name',	validators=[	 								InputRequired  ,	check_duplicate_category  	 				] 	  So,	we	created	our	validator	in	a	factory	style,	where	we	can	get	separate validation	results	based	on	whether	we	want	a	case-sensitive	comparison.	We can	even	write	a	class-based	design,	which	makes	the	validator	much	more generic	and	flexible,	but	I	will	leave	that	for	you	to	explore.   Creating	a	custom	widget  Just	like	we	can	create	custom	fields	and	validators,	we	can	also	create	custom widgets.	These	widgets	allow	us	to	control	how	our	fields	will	look	at	the frontend.	Each	field	type	has	a	widget	associated	with	it.	WTForms,	by	itself, provides	a	lot	of	basic	and	HTML5	widgets.	In	this	recipe,	to	understand	how	to write	a	custom	widget,	we	will	convert	our	custom	selection	field	for	Category into	a	radio	field.	I	agree	with	those	of	you	who	would	argue	that	we	can	directly use	the	radio	field	provided	by	WTForms.	Here,	we	are	just	trying	to	understand how	to	do	it	ourselves.  The	widgets	provided	by	default	by	WTForms	can	be	found	at	https:  wtforms.readthedocs.org en lates t widgets.html.   How	to	do	it...  In	our	previous	recipe,	we	created	CategoryField.	This	field	used	the	Select	widget, which	was	provided	by	the	Select	superclass.	Let's	replace	the	Select	widget	with a	radio	input	in	models.py:  from	wtforms.widgets	import	html_params,	Select,	HTMLString	 	 class	CustomCategoryInput Select :	 	 				def	__call__ self,	field,	**kwargs :	 								kwargs.setdefault 'id',	field.id 	 								html	=	[]	 								for	val,	label,	selected	in	field.iter_choices  :	 												html.append 	 																' 	%s'	%	 	 																				html_params 	 																								name=field.name,	value=val,	 																											checked=selected,	**kwargs	 																				 ,	label	 																 	 												 	 								return	HTMLString '	'.join html  	 	 class	CategoryField SelectField :	 				widget	=	CustomCategoryInput  	 	 					Rest	of	the	code	remains	same	as	in	last	recipe	Creating	 							custom	field	and	validation	  Here,	we	added	a	class	attribute	called	widget	to	our	CategoryField	class.	This widget	points	to	CustomCategoryInput,	which	takes	care	of	HTML	code	generation for	the	field	to	be	rendered.	This	class	has	a	__call__	method,	which	is overwritten	to	return	radio	inputs	corresponding	to	the	values	provided	by	the iter_choices  	method	of	CategoryField.   How	it	works...  When	you	open	the	product	creation	page,	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product-create,	it will	look	like	the	following	screenshot:   See	also  Refer	to	the	previous	recipe,	Creating	custom	fields	and	validation,	to understand	more	about	the	level	of	customization	that	can	be	done	to	the components	of	WTForms.   Uploading	files	via	forms  Uploading	files	via	forms,	and	doing	it	properly,	is	usually	a	matter	of	concern for	many	web	frameworks.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	see	how	Flask	and	WTForms handle	this	for	us	in	a	simple	and	streamlined	manner.   How	to	do	it...  First,	we	will	start	with	the	configuration	bit.	We	need	to	provide	a	parameter	to our	application	configuration,	that	is,	UPLOAD_FOLDER.	This	parameter	tells	Flask about	the	location	where	our	uploaded	files	will	be	stored.	We	will	implement	a feature	to	store	product	images.  One	way	to	store	product	images	can	be	to	store	images	in	a	binary	type	field	in	our database,	but	this	method	is	highly	inefficient	and	never	recommended	in	any	application.	We should	always	store	images	and	other	uploads	in	the	filesystem,	and	store	their	locations	in the	database	using	a	string	field.  Add	the	following	statements	to	the	configuration	in	my_app __init__.py:  import	os	 	 ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS	=	set ['txt',	'pdf',	'png',	'jpg',	'jpeg',	'gif'] 	 	 app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']	=	os.path.realpath '.' 	+	 			' my_app static uploads'	  Note	the	app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']	statement,	where	we	are	storing	the	images	inside	a subfolder	in	the	static	folder	itself.	This	will	make	the	process	of	rendering	images	easier. Also	note	the	ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS	statement	that	is	used	to	make	sure	that	only	files	of	a specific	format	go	through.	The	list	here	is	actually	for	demonstration	purposes	only,	and for	image	types,	we	can	filter	this	list	even	more.	Make	sure	the	folder	path	specified	in the	app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']	statement	exists,	or	else	the	application	will	error	out.  In	the	models	file,	that	is,	my_app catalog models.py,	add	the	following	highlighted statements	to	their	designated	places:  from	flask_wtf.file	import	FileField,	FileRequired	 	 class	Product db.Model :	 				image_path	=	db.Column db.String 255  	 	 				def	__init__ self,	name,	price,	category,	image_path :	 								self.image_path	=	image_path	 	 class	ProductForm NameForm :	 	image	=	FileField 'Product	Image',	validators=[FileRequired  ] 	  Check	FileField	for	image	in	ProductForm	and	the	field	for	image_path	to	the	Product model.	This	is	in	line	with	what	we	discussed	earlier	about	storing	files	on	the filesystem	and	storing	their	paths	in	the	database.   Now,	modify	the	create_product  	method	to	save	the	file	in	my_app catalog views.py:  import	os	 from	werkzeug	import	secure_filename	 from	my_app	import	ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS	 	 def	allowed_file filename :	 				return	'.'	in	filename	and	\	 												filename.lower  .rsplit '.',	1 [1]	in	 															ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS	 	 @catalog.route ' product-create',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	create_product  :	 				form	=	ProductForm request.form,	csrf_enabled=False 	 	 				if	form.validate_on_submit  :	 								name	=	form.name.data	 								price	=	form.price.data	 								category	=	Category.query.get_or_404 	 												form.category.data	 								 	 								image	=	form.image.data	 								if	allowed_file image.filename :	 												filename	=	secure_filename image.filename 	 												image.save os.path.join app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'],	 															filename  	 								product	=	Product name,	price,	category,	filename 	 								db.session.add product 	 								db.session.commit  	 								flash 'The	product	%s	has	been	created'	%	name,	'success' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'catalog.product',	id=product.id  	 	 				if	form.errors:	 								flash form.errors,	'danger' 	 	 				return	render_template 'product-create.html',	form=form 	  Add	the	new	field	to	the	product-create	form	in	template	templates product-create.html. Modify	the	form	tag	definition	to	include	the	enctype	parameter,	and	add	the	field for	the	image	before	the	Submit	button	 or	wherever	you	feel	it	is	necessary inside	the	form :  <form	method="POST"	 				action="{{	url_for 'create_product' 	}}"	 				role="form"		 				enctype="multipart form-data">	  <div	class="form- 			group">{{	form.image.label	}}:	{{	 			form.image style='display:inline;' 	}} 	  The	form	should	have	the	enctype="multipart form-data"	statement	to	tell	the application	that	the	form	input	will	have	multipart	data.  Rendering	the	image	is	very	easy,	as	we	are	storing	the	files	in	the	static	folder itself.	Just	add	the	img	tag	wherever	the	image	needs	to	be	displayed	in   templates product.html:  <img	src="{{	url_for 'static',	filename='uploads '	+	 			product.image_path 	}}" >	   How	it	works...  The	field	to	upload	the	image	will	look	something	like	the	following	screenshot:  Following	the	creation	of	the	product,	the	image	will	be	displayed	as	shown	in the	following	screenshot:    Protecting	applications	from	cross- site	request	forgery	 CSRF   In	the	first	recipe	of	this	chapter,	we	learned	that	CSRF	is	an	important	part	of webform	security.	We	will	now	talk	about	this	in	detail.	CSRF	basically	means that	someone	can	hack	into	the	request	that	carries	a	cookie	and	use	this	to trigger	a	destructive	action.	We	won't	be	discussing	CSRF	in	detail	here,	since ample	resources	are	available	on	the	internet	to	learn	about	this.	We	will	talk about	how	WTForms	will	help	us	in	preventing	CSRF.	Flask	does	not	provide any	security	against	CSRF	by	default,	as	this	has	to	be	handled	at	the	form- validation	level,	which	is	not	provided	by	Flask.	However,	in	this	recipe,	we	will see	how	this	is	done	for	us	by	means	of	the	Flask-WTF	extension.  More	information	about	CSRF	can	be	found	at	https:  www.owasp.org index.php Cross-Site_Request_Forgery _ CSRF .   How	to	do	it...  Flask-WTF,	by	default,	provides	a	form	that	is	CSRF-protected.	If	we	have	a look	at	the	recipes	until	now,	we	will	notice	that	we	have	explicitly	told	our	form to	not	be	CSRF-protected.	We	just	have	to	remove	the	corresponding	statement to	enable	CSRF.  So,	form	=	ProductForm csrf_enabled=False 	will	become	form	=	ProductForm  .  Some	configuration	bits	also	need	to	be	done	in	our	application:  app.config['WTF_CSRF_SECRET_KEY']	=	'random	key	for	form'	  By	default,	the	CSRF	key	is	the	same	as	our	application's	secret	key.  With	CSRF	enabled,	we	will	have	to	provide	an	additional	field	in	our	forms; this	is	a	hidden	field	and	contains	the	CSRF	token.	WTForms	takes	care	of	the hidden	field	for	us,	and	we	just	have	to	add	{{	form.csrf_token	}}	to	our	form:   	 				{{	form.csrf_token	}}	  	  That	was	easy!	Now,	this	is	not	the	only	type	of	form	submission	that	we	do.	We also	submit	AJAX	form	posts;	this	actually	happens	a	lot	more	than	normal forms	since	the	advent	of	JavaScript-based	web	applications,	which	are replacing	traditional	web	applications.  For	this,	we	need	to	include	another	step	in	our	application's	configuration:  from	flask_wtf.csrf	import	CSRFProtect	 	 	 	Add	configurations	 	 CSRFProtect app 	  The	preceding	configuration	will	allow	us	to	access	the	CSRF	token	using	{{ csrf_token  	}}	anywhere	in	our	templates.	Now,	there	are	two	ways	to	add	a CSRF	token	to	AJAX	POST	requests.   One	way	is	to	fetch	the	CSRF	token	in	our	script	tag	and	use	it	in	the	POST request:   	 				var	csrfToken	=	"{{	csrf_token  	}}";	  	  Another	way	is	to	render	the	token	in	a	meta	tag	and	use	it	whenever	required:   	  The	difference	between	the	two	approaches	is	that	the	first	approach	may	have	to be	repeated	in	multiple	places,	depending	on	the	number	of	script	tags	in	the application.  Now,	to	add	the	CSRF	token	to	the	AJAX	POST	request,	we	have	to	add	the	X- CSRFToken	attribute	to	it.	This	attribute's	value	can	be	taken	from	either	of	the	two approaches	stated	here.	We	will	take	the	second	one	for	our	example:  var	csrfToken	=	$ 'meta[name="csrf-token"]' .attr 'content' ;	 	 $.ajaxSetup {	 				beforeSend:	function xhr,	settings 	{	 								if	 ! ^ GETHEADOPTIONSTRACE $ i.test settings.type  	{	 												xhr.setRequestHeader "X-CSRFToken",	csrftoken 	 								}	 				}	 } 	  This	will	make	sure	that	a	CSRF	token	is	added	to	all	the	AJAX	POST	requests that	go	out.   How	it	works...  The	following	screenshot	shows	what	the	CSRF	token	added	by	WTForms	in our	form	looks	like:  The	token	is	completely	random	and	different	for	all	the	requests.	There	are multiple	ways	of	implementing	CSRF	token	generation,	but	this	is	beyond	the scope	of	this	book,	although	I	encourage	users	to	take	a	look	at	some implementations	to	understand	how	it's	done.   Authenticating	in	Flask  Authentication	is	an	important	part	of	any	application,	be	it	web-based,	desktop, or	mobile.	Each	kind	of	application	has	certain	best	practices	when	it	comes	to handling	user	authentication.	In	web-based	applications,	especially	Software-as- a-Service	 SaaS 	based	applications,	this	process	is	of	utmost	importance,	as	it acts	as	the	thin	red	line	between	the	application	being	secure	and	insecure.  To	keep	things	simple	and	flexible,	Flask,	by	default,	does	not	provide	any mechanism	for	authentication.	It	always	has	to	be	implemented	by	us,	the developers,	as	per	our		requirements	and	the	application's	requirements.  Authenticating	users	for	your	application	can	be	done	in	multiple	ways.	It	can	be a	simple	session-based	implementation	or	a	more	secure	approach	using the	Flask-Login	extension.	We	can	also	implement	authentication	by	integrating popular	third-party	services	such	as	Lightweight	Directory	Access Protocol	 LDAP 	or	social	logins	such	as	Facebook,	Google,	and	so	on.	In	this chapter,	we	will	go	through	all	of	these	methods.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Creating	a	simple	session-based	authentication Authenticating	using	the	Flask-Login	extension Using	Facebook	for	authentication Using	Google	for	authentication Using	Twitter	for	authentication Authenticating	with	LDAP   Creating	a	simple	session-based authentication  In	session-based	authentication,	when	the	user	logs	in	for	the	first	time,	the	user details	are	set	in	the	session	of	the	application's	server	side	and	stored	in	a	cookie on	the	browser.	After	that,	when	the	user	opens	the	application,	the	details	stored in	the	cookie	are	used	to	check	against	the	session,	and	the	user	is	automatically logged	in	if	the	session	is	alive.  SECRET_KEY	is	an	application	configuration	setting	that	should	always	be	specified	in	your application's	configuration;	otherwise,	the	data	stored	in	the	cookie	as	well	as	the	session	on the	server	side	will	be	in	plain	text,	which	is	highly	insecure.  We	will	implement	a	simple	mechanism	to	do	this	ourselves.  The	implementation	done	in	this	recipe	is	designed	to	explain	how	authentication	works	at	a lower	level.	This	approach	should	not	be	adopted	in	any	production-level	application.   Getting	ready  We	can	start	with	a	Flask	app	configuration,	as	seen	in	Chapter	5,	Webforms	with WTForms.   How	to	do	it...  Configure	the	application	to	use	the	SQLAlchemy	and	WTForms extensions	 refer	to	the	previous	chapter	for	details .	Follow	these	steps	to understand	how:  1.	 Before	starting	with	authentication,	first	create	a	model	to	store	the	user  details.	This	is	achieved	by	creating	models	in flask_authentication my_app auth models.py,	as	follows:  from	werkzeug.security	import	generate_password_hash,	 			check_password_hash	 from	flask_wtf	import	FlaskForm	 from	wtforms	import	TextField,	PasswordField	 from	wtforms.validators	import	InputRequired,	EqualTo	 from	my_app	import	db	 	 class	User db.Model :	 				id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	primary_key=True 	 				username	=	db.Column db.String 100  	 				pwdhash	=	db.Column db.String   	 		 				def	__init__ self,	username,	password :	 								self.username	=	username	 								self.pwdhash	=	generate_password_hash password 	 		 				def	check_password self,	password :	 								return	check_password_hash self.pwdhash,	password 	  The	preceding	code	is	the	User	model,	which	has	two	fields:	username	and pwdhash.	The	username	field	works	as	its	name	suggests.	The	pwdhash	field stores	the	salted	hash	of	the	password,	because	it	is	not	recommended that	you	store	passwords	directly	in	databases.  2.	 Then,	create	two	forms	in	flask_authentication my_app auth models.py;	one	for  user	registration	and	the	other	for	login.	In	RegistrationForm,	create	two	fields of	type	PasswordField,	just	like	any	other	website's	registration;	this	is	to	make sure	that	the	user	enters	the	same	password	in	both	fields,	as	shown	in	the following	snippet:  class	RegistrationForm FlaskForm :	 				username	=	TextField 'Username',	[InputRequired  ] 	 				password	=	PasswordField 	 								'Password',	[	 												InputRequired  ,	EqualTo 'confirm',	message='Passwords	 															must	match' 	 								]	   								]	 				 	 				confirm	=	PasswordField 'Confirm	Password',	[InputRequired  ] 	 	 class	LoginForm FlaskForm :	 				username	=	TextField 'Username',	[InputRequired  ] 	 				password	=	PasswordField 'Password',	[InputRequired  ] 	  3.	 Next,	create	views	in	flask_authentication my_app auth views.py	to	handle	the  user	requests	for	registration	and	login,	as	follows:  from	flask	import	request,	render_template,	flash,	redirect,	 			url_for,	\	 				session,	Blueprint	 from	my_app	import	app,	db	 from	my_app.auth.models	import	User,	RegistrationForm,	LoginForm	 	 auth	=	Blueprint 'auth',	__name__ 	 	 @auth.route ' ' 	 @auth.route ' home' 	 def	home  :	 				return	render_template 'home.html' 	  @auth.route ' register',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	register  :	 				if	session.get 'username' :	 								flash 'Your	are	already	logged	in.',	'info' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'auth.home'  	 	 				form	=	RegistrationForm  	 	 				if	form.validate_on_submit  :	 								username	=	request.form.get 'username' 	 								password	=	request.form.get 'password' 	 								existing_username	=	 											User.query.filter_by username=username .first  	 								if	existing_username:	 												flash 	 																'This	username	has	been	already	taken.	Try	another	 																			one.',	 																'warning'	 												 	 												return	render_template 'register.html',	form=form 	 								user	=	User username,	password 	 								db.session.add user 	 								db.session.commit  	 								flash 'You	are	now	registered.	Please	login.',	'success'  								return	redirect url_for 'auth.login'   				if	form.errors:	 								flash form.errors,	'danger' 	 	 				return	render_template 'register.html',	form=form 	  The	preceding	method	handles	user	registration.	On	a	GET	request,	the registration	form	is	shown	to	the	user;	this	form	asks	for	the	username and	password.	Then,	on	a	POST	request,	the	username	is	checked	for	its uniqueness	after	the	form	validation	is	complete.	If	the	username	is	not   unique,	the	user	is	asked	to	choose	a	new	username;	otherwise,	a	new user	is	created	in	the	database	and	redirected	to	the	login	page.  After	successful	registration,	the	user	is	redirected	to	login,	which	is handled	as	shown	in	the	following	code:  @auth.route ' login',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	login  :	 				form	=	LoginForm  	 	 				if	form.validate_on_submit  :	 								username	=	request.form.get 'username' 	 								password	=	request.form.get 'password' 	 								existing_user	=	 											User.query.filter_by username=username .first  	 	 								if	not	 existing_user	and	existing_user.check_password 											 password  :	 												flash 'Invalid	username	or	password.	Please	try	 															again.',	'danger' 	 												return	render_template 'login.html',	form=form 	 	 								session['username']	=	username	 								flash 'You	have	successfully	logged	in.',	'success' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'auth.home'  	 	 				if	form.errors:	 								flash form.errors,	'danger' 	 	 				return	render_template 'login.html',	form=form 	  The	preceding	method	handles	the	user	login.	After	form	validation,	it first	checks	whether	the	username	exists	in	the	database.	If	not,	it	asks the	user	to	enter	the	correct	username.	Similarly,	it	checks	whether	the password	is	correct.	If	not,	it	asks	the	user	for	the	correct	password.	If	all the	checks	pass,	the	session	is	populated	with	a	username	key,	which	holds the	username	of	the	user.	The	presence	of	this	key	on	the	session indicates	that	the	user	is	logged	in.	Consider	the	following	code:  @auth.route ' logout' 	 def	logout  :	 				if	'username'	in	session:	 								session.pop 'username' 	 								flash 'You	have	successfully	logged	out.',	'success' 	 	 				return	redirect url_for 'auth.home'  	  The	preceding	method	becomes	self-implied	once	we've	understood	the login  	method.	Here,	we	just	popped	out	the	username	key	from	the session,	and	the	user	got	logged	out	automatically.   4.	 Next,	create	the	templates	that	are	rendered	by	the	register  	and	login    handlers	for	the	registration	and	login,	respectively,	created	earlier.  The	flask_authentication my_app templates base.html	template	remains	almost the	same	as	it	was	in	Chapter	5,	Webforms	with	WTForms.	The	only change	will	be	with	the	routing,	where	catalog	will	be	replaced	by	auth.  First,	create	a	simple	home page,	flask_authentication my_app templates home.html,	as	shown	in	the following	code.	This	reflects	whether	the	user	is	logged	in	or	not	and	also shows	links	for	registration	and	login	if	the	user	is	not	logged	in:  {%	extends	'base.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 Welcome	to	the	Authentication	Demo 	 		{%	if	session.username	%}	 				 Hey	{{	session.username	}}!! 	 				 Click	here	to	 							logout 	 		{%	else	%}	 		Click	here	to	 login 	or	 						 register 	 		{%	endif	%}	 {%	endblock	%}	  Now	create	a	registration	page, flask_authentication my_app templates register.html,	as	follows:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				<form	 								method="POST"	 								action="{{	url_for 'auth.register' 	}}"	 								role="form">	 						{{	form.csrf_token	}}	 						 {{	form.username.label	}}:	{{	 									form.username  	}} 	 						 {{	form.password.label	}}:	{{	 									form.password  	}} 	 						 {{	form.confirm.label	}}:	{{	 									form.confirm  	}} 	 						  									Submit 	 				 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  Finally,	create	a	simple	login	page, flask_authentication my_app templates login.html,	with	the	following	code:   {%	extends	'home.html'	%}	 	 {%	block	container	%}	 		 	 				<form	 								method="POST"	 								action="{{	url_for 'auth.login' 	}}"	 								role="form">	 						{{	form.csrf_token	}}	 						 {{	form.username.label	}}:	{{	 									form.username  	}} 	 						 {{	form.password.label	}}:	{{	 									form.password  	}} 	 						  									Submit 	 				 	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	   How	it	works...  The	working	of	this	application	is	demonstrated	with	the	help	of	the	screenshots in	this	section.  The	following	screenshot	displays	the	home	page	that	comes	up	on	opening http:  127.0.0.1:5000 home:  Home	page	visible	to	a	user	who	is	not	logged	in  The	registration	page	that	comes	up	on	opening	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 register	looks like	the	following	screenshot:   The	registration	form  After	registration,	the	login	page	will	be	shown	on	opening http:  127.0.0.1:5000 login,	as	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:   Login	page	rendered	after	successful	registration  Finally,	the	home	page	is	shown	to	the	logged-in	user	at	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 home, as	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:  Home	page	as	shown	to	a	logged-in	user   See	also  The	next	recipe,	Authenticating	using	the	Flask-Login	extension,	will	cover	a more	secure	and	production-ready	method	of	performing	user	authentication.   Authenticating	using	the	Flask-Login extension  In	our	previous	recipe,	we	learned	how	to	implement	session-based authentication	ourselves.	Flask-Login	is	a	popular	extension	that	handles	a	lot	of the	same	stuff	in	a	helpful	and	efficient	way,	and	thus	saves	us	from	reinventing the	wheel	all	over	again.	In	addition,	Flask-Login	will	not	bind	us	to	any	specific database	or	limit	us	to	use	any	specific	fields	or	methods	for	authentication.	It can	also	handle	the	Remember	me	feature,	account	recovery	features,	and	so	on. In	this	recipe,	we	will	understand	how	to	use	Flask-Login	with	our	application.   Getting	ready  Modify	the	application	created	in	the	previous	recipe	to	accommodate	the changes	to	be	done	by	the	Flask-Login	extension.  Before	that,	we	have	to	install	the	extension	itself	with	the	following	command:  				$	pip3	install	Flask-Login		   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	understand	how	Flask-Login	can	be	integrated	with	a	Flask application:  1.	 To	use	Flask-Login,	first	modify	the	application's	configuration,	which	is	in  flask_authentication my_app __init__.py,	as	follows:  from	flask_login	import	LoginManager	 	 	 	Do	other	application	config	 	 	 login_manager	=	LoginManager  	 login_manager.init_app app 	 login_manager.login_view	=	'auth.login'	  In	the	preceding	code	snippet,	after	importing	the	LoginManager	class	from the	extension,	we	created	an	object	of	this	class.	Then,	we	configured	the app	object	for	use	with	LoginManager	using	init_app  .	There	are	then	multiple configurations	that	can	be	done	in	the	login_manager	object,	as	and	when needed.	Here,	we	have	just	demonstrated	one	basic	and	compulsory configuration,	that	is,	login_view,	which	points	to	the	view	handler	for login	requests.	In	addition,	we	can	also	configure	messages	to	be	shown to	the	users,	such	as	how	long	a	session	will	last,	handling	logins	using request	headers,	and	so	on.	Refer	to	the	Flask-Login	documentation	at	htt ps:  flask-login.readthedocs.org en latest customizing-the-login-process	for more	detail.  2.	 Flask-Login	calls	for	some	additional	methods	to	be	added	to	the	User model class	in	my_app auth models.py,	as	shown	in	the	following	snippet:  @property def	is_authenticated self : 				return	True	 	 @property def	is_active self : 				return	True	 	 @property def	is_anonymous self : 				return	False	 	   def	get_id self : 				return	str self.id 	  In	the	preceding	code,	we	added	four	methods,	which	are	explained	as follows:  is_authenticated  :	This	property	returns	True.	This	should	return	False	only	in cases	where	we	do	not	want	a	user	to	be	authenticated. is_active  :	This	property	returns	True.	This	should	return	False	only	in	cases where	we	have	blocked	or	banned	a	user. is_anonymous  :	This	property	is	used	to	indicate	a	user	who	is	not	supposed	to be	logged	in	to	the	system	and	should	access	the	application	as	anonymous. This	should	return	False	for	regular	logged-in	users. get_id  :	This	method	represents	the	unique	ID	used	to	identify	the	user. This	should	be	a	unicode	value.  It	is	not	necessary	to	implement	all	of	the	methods	and	properties	discussed	while implementing	a	user	class.	To	make	things	easier,	you	can	always subclass	the	UserMixin	class	from	flask_login,	which	has	default	implementations	already done	for	the	methods	and	properties	we	mentioned.	For	more	information	on	this, visit	https:  flask-login.readthedocs.io en latest flask_login.UserMixin.  3.	 Next,	make	the	following	changes	to	the	views	in	my_app auth views.py:  from	flask	import	g	 from	flask_login	import	current_user,	login_user,	logout_user,	login_required	 from	my_app	import	login_manager	 	 @login_manager.user_loader	 def	load_user id :	 				return	User.query.get int id  	 	 @auth.before_request	 def	get_current_user  :	 				g.user	=	current_user	  In	the	preceding	method,	the	@auth.before_request	decorator	implies	that	the method	will	be	called	before	the	view	function	whenever	a	request	is received.  In	the	following	snippet,	we	have	memorized	our	logged-in	user:  @auth.route ' login',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	login  :	 				if	current_user.is_authenticated:	 								flash 'You	are	already	logged	in.',	'info' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'auth.home'  	 	   									Same	block	of	code	as	from	last	recipe	Creating	a	simple	session	 											based	authentication	 									Next	replace	the	statement	session['username']	=	 											username	by	the	one	below	 								login_user existing_user 	 								flash 'You	have	successfully	logged	in.',	'success' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'auth.home'  	 	 				if	form.errors:	 								flash form.errors,	'danger' 	 	 				return	render_template 'login.html',	form=form 	 	 @auth.route ' logout' 	 @login_required	 def	logout  :	 				logout_user  	 				return	redirect url_for 'home'  	  Notice	that	now,	in	login  ,	we	check	whether	the	current_user	is authenticated	before	doing	anything	else.	Here,	current_user	is	a	proxy	that represents	the	object	for	the	currently	logged-in	User	record.	After	all validations	and	checks	are	done,	the	user	is	then	logged	in	using	the login_user  	method.	This	method	accepts	the	user	object	and	handles	all of	the	session-related	activities	required	to	log	in	a	user.  Now	if	we	move	on	to	the	logout  	method,	we	can	see	that	a	decorator has	been	added	for	login_required  .	This	decorator	makes	sure	that	the user	is	logged	in	before	this	method	is	executed.	It	can	be	used	for	any view	method	in	our	application.	To	log	a	user	out,	we	just	have	to	call logout_user  ,	which	will	clean	up	the	session	for	the	currently	logged-in user	and,	in	turn,	log	the	user	out	of	the	application.  As	we	do	not	handle	sessions	ourselves,	a	minor	change	in	the	templates is	required,	as	shown	in	the	following	snippet.	This	happens	whenever we	want	to	check	whether	a	user	is	logged	in	and	whether	particular content	needs	to	be	shown	to	them:  {%	if	current_user.is_authenticated	%}	 ...do	something...	 {%	endif	%}	   How	it	works...  The	demonstration	in	this	recipe	works	exactly	as	it	did	in	the	previous	recipe, Creating	a	simple	session-based	authentication.	Only	the	implementation differs,	but	the	end	result	remains	the	same.   There's	more...  The	Flask-Login	extension	makes	the	implementation	of	the	Remember	me feature	pretty	simple.	To	do	so,	just	pass	remember=True	to	the	login_user  	method. This	will	save	a	cookie	on	the	user's	computer,	and	Flask-Login	will automatically	use	this	to	log	the	user	in	automatically	if	the	session	is	active. You	should	try	implementing	this	on	your	own.   See	also  See	the	previous	recipe,	Creating	a	simple	session-based	authentication,	to understand	the	complete	working	of	this	recipe. Flask	provides	a	special	object	called	g.	You	can	read	more	about	this	at	http :  flask.pocoo.org docs 1.0 api flask.g.   Using	Facebook	for	authentication  You	will	have	noticed	that	many	websites	provide	an	option	to	log	in	to	their own	site	using	third-party	authentications	such	as	Facebook,	Google,	Twitter, LinkedIn,	and	so	on.	This	has	been	made	possible	by	OAuth	2,	which	is	an	open standard	for	authorization.	It	allows	the	client	site	to	use	an	access	token	to access	the	protected	information	and	resources	provided	by	the	resource	server. In	this	recipe,	we	will	show	you	how	to	implement	OAuth-based	authorization via	Facebook.	In	later	recipes,	we	will	do	the	same	using	other	providers.   Getting	started  OAuth	2		only	works	with	SSL,	so	the	application	should	run	with	HTTPS.	To do	this	on	a	local	machine,	please	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Install	pyopenssl	using	the	$	pip3	install	pyopenssl	command. 2.	 Add	additional	options	to	app.run  	,	including	ssl_context	with	the	value  adhoc.	The	completed	app.run	should	look	as	follows: app.run debug=True,	ssl_context='adhoc' .  3.	 Once	these	changes	have	been	made,	run	the	application	using	the  URL	https:  localhost:5000 .	Before	the	app	loads,	your	browser	will	display warnings	about	the	certificate	not	being	safe.	Just	accept	the	warning	and proceed.  "This	is	not	a	recommended	method.	In	production	systems,	SSL	certificates	should	be	obtained	from	a	proper	certifying	authority."  To	install	Flask-Dance	and	generate	Facebook	credentials,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 First,	install	the	Flask-Dance	extension	and	its	dependencies	with	the  following	command:  				$	pip3	install	Flask-Dance		  2.	 Next,	register	for	a	Facebook	application	that	will	be	used	for	login. Although	the	process	for	registration	on	the	Facebook	app	is	pretty straightforward	and	self-explanatory,	in	this	case	we	are	only	concerned with	the	App	ID,	App	Secret,	and	Site	URL	options,	as	shown	in	the following	screenshot	 more	information	on	this	can	be	found	on	the Facebook	developer	pages	at	https:  developers.facebook.com  :   While	configuring	Facebook,	make	sure	to	configure	the	Site	URL	to https:  localhost:5000 	for	the	purpose	of	this	recipe,	as	shown	in	the following	screenshot:   How	to	do	it...  To	enable	Facebook	authentication	for	your	application,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 As	always,	start	with	the	configuration	part	in	my_app __init__.py.	Add	the  following	lines	of	code;	do	not	remove	or	edit	anything	else	unless	you	are confident	of	the	change:  app.config["FACEBOOK_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID"]	=	'my	facebook	app	ID' app.config["FACEBOOK_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"]	=	'my	facebook	app	secret'  from	my_app.auth.views	import	facebook_blueprint app.register_blueprint facebook_blueprint 	  In	the	preceding	code	snippet,	we	used	Flask-Dance	with	our	application for	authentication.	This	blueprint	will	be	created	in	the	views	file,	which we	will	cover	next.  2.	 Now	modify	the	views,	that	is,	my_app auth views.py,	as	follows:  from	flask_dance.contrib.facebook	import	make_facebook_blueprint,	facebook	  facebook_blueprint	=	make_facebook_blueprint scope='email',	redirect_to='auth.facebook_login'   make_facebook_blueprint	reads	FACEBOOK_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID	and FACEBOOK_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET	from	the	application	configuration	and	takes care	of	all	the	OAuth-related	handling	in	the	background.	While	making the	Facebook	blueprint,	we	set	scope	to	email,	so	that	an	email	address	can be	used	as	a	unique	username.	We	also	set	redirect_to	to auth.facebook_login,	so	Facebook	routes	the	application	back	to	this	URL once	authentication	succeeds.	If	this	option	is	not	set,	the	application	will be	automatically	redirected	to	the	home	page,	that	is,	 .  3.	 Now	create	a	new	route	handler	to	handle	the	login	using	Facebook,	as  follows:  @auth.route " facebook-login"  def	facebook_login  : 				if	not	facebook.authorized: 								return	redirect url_for "facebook.login"    				resp	=	facebook.get " me?fields=name,email"   				user	=	User.query.filter_by username=resp.json     				user	=	User.query.filter_by username=resp.json   				["email"] .first   				if	not	user: 								user	=	User resp.json  ["email"],	''  								db.session.add user  								db.session.commit    				login_user user  				flash  								'Logged	in	as	name=%s	using	Facebook	login'	%	  												resp.json  ['name'] ,	'success'	  				return	redirect request.args.get 'next',	url_for 'auth.home'     This	method	first	checks	whether	a	user	is	already	authorized	with Facebook.	If	not,	it	redirects	the	app	to	Facebook's	login	handler,	where the	user	will	need	to	follow	the	steps	outlined	by	Facebook	and	give	the necessary	permissions	to	our	application	in	order	to	access	the	requested user	details,	as	per	the	settings	in	make_facebook_blueprint.	Once	the	user	is authorized	with	Facebook,	the	method	then	requests	a	user's	details,	such as	their	name	and	email	address,	from	Facebook.	Using	these	user details,	it	is	determined	whether	a	user	already	exists	with	the	email entered	or	not.	If	not,	a	new	user	is	created	and	logged	in;	otherwise,	the existing	user	is	directly	logged	in.  4.	 Finally,	modify	the	login.html	template	to	allow	for	a	broader	social	login  functionality.	This	will	act	as	a	placeholder	for	the	Facebook	login,	as	well as	a	number	of	alternative	social	logins,	which	we	will	cover	later.	The code	for	the	updated	login.html	template	is	as	follows:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%} {%	block	container	%} 		  				  					 <a	href="simple-form"	data- 							toggle="tab">Old	Style	Login   					  Social	 					Logins   				  				  						  								<form 												method="POST" 												action="{{	url_for 'auth.login' 	}}" 												role="form"> 										{{	form.csrf_token	}} 										 {{	form.username.label	}}:	{{	 										form.username  	}}  										 {{	form.password.label	}}:	{{	 										form.password  	}}  										<button	type="submit"	class="btn	btn- 										default">Submit  								  						  						    						  								<a	href="{{	url_for 'auth.facebook_login',	 								next=url_for 'auth.home'  	}}">Login	via	Facebook  						  				  		  {%	endblock	%}  In	the	preceding	code,	we	created	a	tabbed	structure	where	the	first	tab	is our	conventional	login	and	the	second	tab	corresponds	to	social logins.	Currently,	there	is	just	one	option	for	Facebook	available.	More options	will	be	added	in	upcoming	recipes.	Note	that	the	link	is	currently simple;	we	can	always	add	styles	and	buttons	as	needed	later	on.   How	it	works...  The	login	page	has	a	new	tab	that	provides	an	option	to	the	user	to	log	in	using Social	Logins,	as	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:  When	we	click	on	the	Login	via	Facebook	link,	the	application	is	taken	to Facebook,	where	the	user	will	be	asked	for	their	login	details	and	permission. Once	the	permission	is	granted,	the	user	will	be	logged	in	to	the	application.   Using	Google	for	authentication  Just	like	we	did	for	Facebook,	we	can	integrate	our	application	to	enable	login using	Google.   Getting	ready  Start	by	building	over	the	last	recipe.	It	is	easy	to	implement	Google authentication–simply	leave	out	the	Facebook-specific	elements.  Now	create	a	new	project	from	the	Google	developer	console	 https:  console.deve lopers.google.com .	In	the	APIs	and	Services	section,	click	on	Credentials.	Then, create	a	new	client	ID	for	the	web	application;	this	ID	will	provide	the credentials	needed	for	OAuth	2	to	work.	You	will	also	need	to	configure	the OAuth	consent	screen	before	a	client	ID	can	be	created,	as	shown	in	the following	screenshot:    How	to	do	it...  To	enable	Google	authentication	in	your	application,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 As	always,	start	with	the	configuration	part	in	my_app __init__.py,	as	follows:  app.config["GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID"]	=	"my	google	OAuth	client	ID" app.config["GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"]	=	"my	google	OAuth	client	secret" app.config["OAUTHLIB_RELAX_TOKEN_SCOPE"]	=	True  from	my_app.auth.views	import	google_blueprint app.register_blueprint google_blueprint   In	the	preceding	code	snippet,	we	registered	the	Google	blueprint provided	by	Flask-Dance	with	our	application	for	authentication.	This blueprint	will	be	created	in	the	views	file,	which	we	will	take	a	look	at next.	Note	the	additional	configuration	option,	OAUTHLIB_RELAX_TOKEN_SCOPE. This	is	suggested	for	use	when	implementing	Google	authentication because	Google	tends	to	provide	data	that	sometimes	diverges	from	the scope	mentioned.  2.	 Next,	modify	the	views,	that	is,	my_app auth views.py,	as	follows:  from	flask_dance.contrib.google	import	make_google_blueprint,	google  google_blueprint	=	make_google_blueprint  				scope=[ 								"openid", 								"https:  www.googleapis.com auth userinfo.email", 								"https:  www.googleapis.com auth userinfo.profile"], 				redirect_to='auth.google_login'   In	the	preceding	code	snippet,	make_google_blueprint	reads GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID	and	GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET	from	the	application configuration	and	takes	care	of	all	the	OAuth-related	handling	in	the background.	While	making	the	Google	blueprint,	we	set	scope	to	openid, https:  www.googleapis.com auth userinfo.email,	and https:  www.googleapis.com auth userinfo.profile,	because	we	want	to	use	a user's	email	address	as	their	unique	username	and	display	name	after login.	openid	is	required	in	scope	because	Google	prefers	it.  We	also	set	redirect_to	to	auth.google_login	so	Google	is	able	to	route	the   application	back	to	this	URL	after	authentication	has	succeeded.	If	this option	is	not	set,	the	application	will	be	automatically	redirected	to	the home	page,	that	is,	 .  3.	 Next,	create	a	new	route	handler	that	handles	the	login	using	Google	with  the	following	code:  @auth.route " google-login"  def	google_login  : 				if	not	google.authorized: 								return	redirect url_for "google.login"    				resp	=	google.get " oauth2 v1 userinfo"   				user	=	User.query.filter_by username=resp.json  ["email"] .first   				if	not	user: 								user	=	User resp.json  ["email"],	''  								db.session.add user  								db.session.commit    				login_user user  				flash  								'Logged	in	as	name=%s	using	Google	login'	%	  												resp.json  ['name'] ,	'success'	  				return	redirect request.args.get 'next',	url_for 'auth.home'     Here,	the	method	first	checks	whether	the	user	is	already	authorized	with Google.	If	not,	it	redirects	the	app	to	the	Google	login	handler,	where	the user	will	need	to	follow	the	steps	outlined	by	Google	and	give	permission to	our	application	so	it	can	access	the	requested	user	details.	Once	the user	is	authorized	with	Google,	the	method	requests	the	user's	details, including	their	name	and	email	address,	from	Google.	Using	these	user details,	it	is	determined	whether	a	user	already	exists	with	this	email	or not.	If	not,	a	new	user	is	created	and	logged	in;	otherwise,	the	existing user	is	directly	logged	in.  4.	 Finally,	modify	the	login	template,	login.html,	to	allow	the	Google	login.  Add	the	following	line	inside	the	social-logins	tab:   Login	via	Google 	   How	it	works...  The	Google	login	works	in	a	manner	similar	to	the	Facebook	login	from	the previous	recipe.   Using	Twitter	for	authentication  OAuth	was	actually	born	while	writing	the	OpenID	API	for	Twitter.	In	this recipe,	we	will	integrate	Twitter	login	with	our	application.   Getting	ready  We	will	continue	by	building	over	the	Using	Google	for	authentication	recipe.	It is	easy	to	implement	Twitter	authentication	–	simply	leave	out	the	Facebook	or Google-specific	parts	from	the	previous	authentication	recipes.  First,	we	have	to	create	an	application	from	the	Twitter	Application	Management page	 https:  developer.twitter.com en apps .	It	will	automatically	create	Consumer API	keys	 API	key	and	API	secret	key 	for	us	to	use,	as	shown	in	the	following screenshot:   How	to	do	it...  To	enable	Twitter	authentication	for	your	application,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 First,	start	with	the	configuration	part	in	my_app __init__.py,	as	follows:  app.config["TWITTER_OAUTH_CLIENT_KEY"]	=	"twitter	app	api	key" app.config["TWITTER_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"]	=	"twitter	app	secret	key"  from	my_app.auth.views	import	twitter_blueprint app.register_blueprint twitter_blueprint   In	the	preceding	code	snippet,	we	registered	the	Twitter	blueprint provided	by	Flask-Dance	with	our	application	for	authentication.	This blueprint	will	be	created	in	the	views	file,	which	we	will	take	a	look	at next.	  2.	 Next,	modify	the	views,	that	is,	my_app auth views.py,	as	follows:  from	flask_dance.contrib.twitter	import	make_twitter_blueprint,	twitter	 	 twitter_blueprint	=	make_twitter_blueprint redirect_to='auth.twitter_login' 	  In	the	preceding	code,	make_google_blueprint	reads	TWITTER_OAUTH_CLIENT_KEY and	TWITTER_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET	from	the	application	configuration	and	takes care	of	all	the	OAuth-related	handling	in	the	background.	There	is	no need	to	set	any	scope,	as	we	did	during	Facebook	and	Google authentication,	because	this	recipe	will	use	a	Twitter	handle	as	the username,	which	is	provided	by	default.  We	also	set	redirect_to	to	auth.twitter_login	so	that	Twitter	can	route	the application	back	to	this	URL	after	authentication	has	succeeded.	If	this option	is	not	set,	the	application	will	be	automatically	redirected	to	the home	page,	that	is,	 .  3.	 Next,	create	a	new	route	handler	that	handles	the	login	using	Twitter,	as  follows:  @auth.route " twitter-login"  def	twitter_login  : 				if	not	twitter.authorized: 								return	redirect url_for "twitter.login"     								return	redirect url_for "twitter.login"    				resp	=	twitter.get "account verify_credentials.json"   				user	=	User.query.filter_by username=resp.json  ["screen_name"] .first   				if	not	user: 								user	=	User resp.json  ["screen_name"],	''  								db.session.add user  								db.session.commit    				login_user user  				flash  								'Logged	in	as	name=%s	using	Twitter	login'	%	  												resp.json  ['name'] ,	'success'	  				return	redirect request.args.get 'next',	url_for 'auth.home'     The	preceding	method	first	checks	whether	the	user	is	already	authorized with	Twitter.	If	not,	it	redirects	the	app	to	the	Twitter	login	handler, where	the	user	will	need	to	follow	the	steps	outlined	by	Twitter	and	give permission	to	our	application	so	it	can	access	the	request	user details.	Once	the	user	is	authorized	with	Twitter,	the	method	requests	the user's	details,	including	their	screen	name	or	handle	from	Twitter.	Using these	user	details,	it	is	determined	whether	a	user	already	exists	with	this Twitter	handle	or	not.	If	not,	a	new	user	is	created	and	logged	in; otherwise,	the	existing	user	is	directly	logged	in.  4.	 Finally,	modify	the	login	template,	login.html,	to	allow	the	Twitter	login.  Add	the	following	line	inside	the		social-logins	tab:   Login	via	Twitter    How	it	works...  This	recipe	works	in	a	manner	similar	to	the	Facebook	and	Google	logins	from previous	recipes.  Similarly,	we	can	integrate	LinkedIn,	GitHub,	and	scores	of	other	third-party	providers	that provide	support	for	login	and	authentication	using	OAuth.	It's	up	to	you	to	implement	any more	integrations.

Authenticating	with	LDAP  LDAP	is	essentially	an	internet	protocol	for	looking	up	contact	information about	users,	certificates,	network	pointers,	and	more	from	a	server	where	the data	is	stored	in	a	directory-style	structure.	Of	LDAP's	multiple	use	cases,	the most	popular	is	the	single	sign-on	functionality,	where	a	user	can	access	multiple services	by	logging	in	to	just	one,	as	the	credentials	are	shared	across	the	system.   Getting	ready  In	this	recipe,	we	will	create	a	login	page	similar	to	the	one	we	created	in	the first	recipe	of	this	chapter,	Creating	a	simple	session-based	authentication.	The user	can	log	in	using	their	LDAP	credentials.	If	the	credentials	are	successfully authenticated	on	the	provided	LDAP	server,	the	user	is	logged	in.  If	you	already	have	an	LDAP	server	that	you	can	access,	feel	free	to	skip	the LDAP	setup	instructions	in	this	section.  1.	 The	first	step	is	to	get	access	to	an	LDAP	server.	This	can	be	a	server  already	hosted	somewhere,	or	you	can	create	your	own	local	LDAP	server. The	easiest	way	to	spawn	a	demo	LDAP	server	is	by	using	Docker.  Here,	we	are	assuming	that	you	have	prior	experience	in	Docker	and	have	Docker	installed on	your	machine.	If	not,	please	refer	to	https:  docs.docker.com get-started .  2.	 To	create	an	LDAP	server	using	Docker,	run	the	following	command	on	the  terminal:  $	docker	run	-p	389:389	-p	636:636	--name	my-openldap-container	--detach	osixia openldap:1.2.4  3.	 Once	the	preceding	command	has	successfully	executed,	test	the	server	by  searching	for	an	example	user	with	the	username	and	password	as	admin and	admin,	as	follows:  $	docker	exec	my-openldap-container	ldapsearch	-x	-H	ldap:  localhost	-b	dc=example,dc=org	-D	"cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org"	-w	admin  The	successful	execution	of	the	preceding	command	indicates	that	the LDAP	server	is	running	and	is	ready	for	use.  Refer	to	https:  github.com osixia docker-openldap	for	more	information	on	the	OpenLDAP	Docker image.  Now	install	the	Python	library	that	will	help	our	application	talk	to	the	LDAP server	with	the	following	code:  				$	pip3	install	python-ldap   How	to	do	it...  To	enable	LDAP	authentication	for	your	application,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 As	always,	start	with	the	configuration	part	in	my_app __init__.py,	as	follows:  import	ldap  app.config['LDAP_PROVIDER_URL']	=	'ldap:  localhost'  def	get_ldap_connection  : 				conn	=	ldap.initialize app.config['LDAP_PROVIDER_URL']  				return	conn  In	the	preceding	code	snippet,	we	imported	ldap,	then	created	an	app configuration	option	that	points	to	the	LDAP	server	address.	This	is followed	by	the	creation	of	a	simple	function,	get_ldap_connection,	which creates	the	LDAP	connection	object	on	the	server	and	then	returns	that connection	object.  2.	 Next,	modify	the	views,	that	is,	my_app auth views.py,	where	a	new  route,	ldap_login,	is	created	to	facilitate	login	via	LDAP,	as	follows:  import	ldap from	my_app	import	get_ldap_connection  @auth.route " ldap-login",	methods=['GET',	'POST']  def	ldap_login  : 				if	current_user.is_authenticated: 								flash 'Your	are	already	logged	in.',	'info'  								return	redirect url_for 'auth.home'    				form	=	LoginForm    				if	form.validate_on_submit  : 								username	=	request.form.get 'username'  								password	=	request.form.get 'password'  								try: 												conn	=	get_ldap_connection   												conn.simple_bind_s  																'cn=%s,dc=example,dc=org'	%	username, 																password 												  								except	ldap.INVALID_CREDENTIALS: 												flash 'Invalid	username	or	password.	Please	try	again.', 											'danger'  												return	render_template 'login.html',	form=form   								user	=	User.query.filter_by username=username .first     								user	=	User.query.filter_by username=username .first   								if	not	user: 												user	=	User username,	password  												db.session.add user  												db.session.commit    								login_user user  								flash 'You	have	successfully	logged	in.',	'success'  								return	redirect url_for 'auth.home'    				if	form.errors: 								flash form.errors,	'danger'   				return	render_template 'log–in.html',	form=form   Here,	we	first	checked	whether	the	user	is	already	authenticated.	If	they were,	we	redirected	to	the	home	page;	otherwise,	we	moved	ahead.	We then	used	LoginForm,	which	we	created	in	the	Creating	a	simple	session- based	authentication	recipe,	as	we	also	require	a	username	and	password. Next,	we	validated	the	form	and	then	fetched	the	connection	object using	get_ldap_connection.	After,	the	application	tried	to	authenticate	the user	from	the	LDAP	server	using	simple_bind_s.	Notice	the	string	inside this	method,	'cn=%s,dc=example,dc=org'	–	this	string	might	vary	for	each LDAP	server	depending	on	the	configurations	internal	to	the	server.	You are	urged	to	contact	your	LDAP	server	admin	if	these	details	are	not known.  If	the	user	is	successfully	authenticated,	then	a	new	user	record	is	created in	our	local	database	and	the	user	is	logged	in.	Otherwise,	the	LDAP connection	fails	and	throws	the	error	INVALID_CREDENTIALS,	which	is	then caught	and	the	user	is	notified	accordingly.  We	just	witnessed	the	power	of	reusable	components!	As	you	can	see,	LoginForm	has	now been	used	for	two	different	purposes.	This	is	a	good	coding	practice.  3.	 Finally,	modify	the	login	template,	login.html,	to	allow	the	LDAP	login,	as  follows:  {%	extends	'home.html'	%}  {%	block	container	%} 		  				  					  Old	 					Style	Login   					  Social	 					Logins   					  LDAP	Login   				  				  						    						  								  								<form 												method="POST" 												action="{{	url_for 'auth.login' 	}}" 												role="form"> 										{{	form.csrf_token	}} 										 {{	form.username.label	}}:	{{	 										form.username  	}}  										 {{	form.password.label	}}:	{{	 										form.password  	}}  										  										Submit  								  						  						  								<a	href="{{	url_for 'auth.facebook_login',	 									next=url_for 'auth.home'  	}}">Login	via	Facebook  								  								<a	href="{{	url_for 'auth.google_login',	 									next=url_for 'auth.home'  	}}">Login	via	Google  								  								<a	href="{{	url_for 'auth.twitter_login',	 									next=url_for 'auth.home'  	}}">Login	via	Twitter  						  						  								  								<form 												method="POST" 												action="{{	url_for 'auth.ldap_login' 	}}" 												role="form"> 										{{	form.csrf_token	}} 										 {{	form.username.label	}}:	{{	 											form.username  	}}  										 {{	form.password.label	}}:	{{ 										form.password  	}}  										  											Submit  								  						  				  		  {%	endblock	%}   How	it	works...  The	new	login	screen	with	the	LDAP	tab	should	look	like	the	following screenshot:  Here,	the	user	simply	needs	to	enter	their	username	and	password.	If	the credentials	are	correct,	the	user	will	be	logged	in	and	taken	to	the	home	screen; otherwise,	an	error	will	occur.   See	also  You	can	read	more	about	LDAP	at	https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Lightweight_Director y_Access_Protocol	and	https:  www.python-ldap.org.   RESTful	API	Building An	Application	Programming	Interface	 API 	can	be	summarized	as	a developer's	interface	with	the	application.	Just	like	end	users	have	a	visible frontend	user	interface	with	which	to	work	on	and	talk	to	the	application, developers	also	need	a	user	interface	to	the	application.	Representational	State Transfer	 REST 	is	not	a	protocol	or	a	standard.	It	is	just	a	software architectural	style	or	a	set	of	suggestions	defined	for	writing	applications,	the aim	of	which	is	to	simplify	the	interfaces	within	and	without	the	application. When	web	service	APIs	are	written	in	a	way	that	adheres	to	the	REST definitions,	then	they	are	known	as	RESTful	APIs.	Being	RESTful	keeps	the API	decoupled	from	the	internal	application	details.	This	results	in	ease	of scalability	and	keeps	things	simple.	The	uniform	interface	ensures	that	each	and every	request	is	documented.  It	is	a	topic	of	debate	as	to	whether	REST	or	SOAP	is	better.	This	is	actually	a	subjective question,	as	it	depends	on	what	needs	to	be	done.	Each	has	its	own	benefits	and	should	be chosen	on	the	basis	of	the	requirements	of	the	application.  REST	calls	for	segregating	your	API	into	logical	resources	can	be	accessed	and manipulated	using	HTTP	requests,	where	each	request	consists	of	one	of	the following	methods:	GET,	POST,	PUT,	PATCH,	and	DELETE	 there	can	be	more,	but	these are	the	ones	used	most	frequently .	Each	of	these	methods	has	a	specific meaning.	One	of	the	key	implied	principles	of	REST	is	that	the	logical	grouping of	resources	should	be	easily	understandable	and,	hence,	provide	simplicity along	with	portability.  As	we	have	used	in	our	book	hitherto,	we	have	a	resource	called	product.	Now, let's	see	how	we	can	logically	map	our	API	calls	to	the	resource	segregation:  GET	 products 1:	This	gets	the	product	with	the	ID	1. GET	 products:	This	gets	the	list	of	products. POST	 products:	This	creates	a	new	product.  PUT	 products 1:	This	replaces	or	recreates	the	product	with	the	ID	1. PATCH	 products 1:	This	partially	updates	the	product	with	the	ID	1. DELETE	 products 1:	This	deletes	the	product	with	the	ID	1.   In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Creating	a	class-based	REST	interface Creating	an	extension-based	REST	interface Creating	a	complete	RESTful	API   Creating	a	class-based	REST interface  We	saw	how	class-based	views	work	in	Flask	using	the	concept	of	pluggable views	in	the	Writing	class-based	views	recipe	in	Chapter	4,	Working	with	Views. In	this	recipe,	we	will	now	see	how	we	can	use	the	same	to	create	views,	which will	provide	a	REST	interface	to	our	application.   Getting	ready  Let's	take	a	simple	view	that	will	handle	the	REST-style	calls	to	our	Product model.   How	to	do	it...  We	simply	have	to	modify	our	views	for	product	handling	to	extend	the MethodView	class	in	views.py:  import	json from	flask.views	import	MethodView,	abort	 	 class	ProductView MethodView :	 	 				def	get self,	id=None,	page=1 :	 								if	not	id:	 												products	=	Product.query.paginate page,	10 .items	 												res	=	{}	 												for	product	in	products:	 																res[product.id]	=	{	 																				'name':	product.name,	 																				'price':	product.price,	 																				'category':	product.category.name	 																}	 								else:	 												product	=	Product.query.filter_by id=id .first  	 												if	not	product:	 																abort 404 	 												res	=	json.dumps {	 																'name':	product.name,	 																'price':	product.price,	 																'category':	product.category.name	 												} 	 								return	res	  The	preceding	get  	method	searches	for	the	product	and	sends	back	a	JSON result.  Similarly,	we	can	write	the	post  ,	put  ,	and	delete  	methods	too:  							def	post self :	 												Create	a	new	product.	 												Return	the	ID object	of	newly	created	product.	 											return	 	 							def	put self,	id :	 												Update	the	product	corresponding	provided	id.	 												Return	the	JSON	corresponding	updated	product.	 											return	 	 							def	delete self,	id :	 												Delete	the	product	corresponding	provided	id.	 												Return	success	or	error	message.	 											return	  Many	of	us	would	question	why	we	have	no	routing	here.	To	include	routing,	we have	to	do	the	following:   have	to	do	the	following:  product_view	=		ProductView.as_view 'product_view' 	 app.add_url_rule ' products ',	view_func=product_view,	 			methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 app.add_url_rule ' products  ',	view_func=product_view,	 			methods=['GET',	'PUT',	'DELETE'] 	  The	first	statement	here	converts	the	class	to	an	actual	view	function	internally that	can	be	used	with	the	routing	system.	The	next	two	statements	are	the	URL rules	corresponding	to	the	calls	that	can	be	made.   How	it	works...  The	MethodView	class	identified	the	type	of	HTTP	method	in	the	request	sent,	and converted	the	name	to	lowercase.	Then,	it	matched	this	to	the	methods	defined	in the	class	and	called	the	matched	method.	So,	if	we	make	a	GET	call	to	ProductView, it	will	automatically	be	mapped	to	the	get  	method	and	processed	accordingly.   Creating	an	extension-based	REST interface  In	the	previous	recipe,	Creating	a	class-based	REST	interface,	we	saw	how	to create	a	REST	interface	using	pluggable	views.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	use	an extension	called	Flask-Restful,	which	is	written	over	the	same	pluggable	views we	used	in	the	previous	recipe,	but	which	handles	a	lot	of	nuances	by	itself	to allow	us	developers	to	focus	on	actual	API	development.	It	is	also	independent of	object-relational	mapping	 ORM ,	so	there	are	no	strings	attached	to	the ORM	we	may	want	to	use.   Getting	ready  First,	we	will	begin	with	the	installation	of	the	extension:  				$	pip3	install	Flask-Restful	  We	will	modify	the	catalog	application	from	the	last	recipe	to	add	a	REST interface	using	this	extension.   How	to	do	it...  As	always,	start	with	changes	to	the	application's	configuration	in my_app __init__.py,	which	will	look	something	like	the	following	lines	of	code:  from	flask_restful	import	Api	 	 api	=	Api app 	  Here,	app	is	our	Flask	application	object instance.  Next,	create	the	API	inside	the	views.py	file.	Here,	we	will	just	try	to	understand how	to	lay	out	the	skeleton	of	the	API.	Actual	methods	and	handlers	will	be covered	in	the	Creating	a	complete	RESTful	API	recipe:  from	flask_restful	import	Resource	 from	my_app	import	api	 	 class	ProductApi Resource :	 	 				def	get self,	id=None :	 									Return	product	data	 								return	'This	is	a	GET	response'	 	 				def	post self :	 									Create	a	new	product	 								return	'This	is	a	POST	response'	 	 				def	put self,	id :	 									Update	the	product	with	given	id	 								return	'This	is	a	PUT	response'	 	 				def	delete self,	id :	 									Delete	the	product	with	given	id	 								return	'This	is	a	DELETE	response'	  api.add_resource 	 				ProductApi,	 				' api product',	 				' api product  '	  	  The	preceding	API	structure	is	self-explanatory.	Consider	the	following	code:  Here,	we	created	the	routing	for	ProductApi,	and	we	can	specify	multiple	routes	as necessary.   How	it	works...  We	will	see	how	this	REST	interface	works	on	the	Python	shell	using	the	requests library.  requests	is	a	very	popular	Python	library	that	makes	the	rendering	of	HTTP	requests	very	easy. It	can	simply	be	installed	by	running	the	following	command:  pip3	install	requests  The	command	will	show	following	information:  			>>>	import	requests 				>>>	res	=	requests.get 'http:  127.0.0.1:5000 api product'  				>>>	res.json   				'This	is	a	GET	response' 				>>>	res	=	requests.post 'http:  127.0.0.1:5000 api product'  				'This	is	a	POST	response' 				>>>	res	=	requests.put 'http:  127.0.0.1:5000 api product 1'  				'This	is	a	PUT	response' 				>>>	res	=	requests.delete 'http:  127.0.0.1:5000 api product 1'  				'This	is	a	DELETE	response'	  In	the	preceding	snippet,	we	saw	that	all	our	requests	are	properly	routed	to	the respective	methods;	this	is	evident	from	the	response	received.   See	also  Refer	to	the	following	recipe,	Creating	a	complete	RESTful	API,	to	see	the	API skeleton	from	this	recipe	coming	to	life.   Creating	a	complete	RESTful	API  In	this	recipe,	we	will	convert	the	API	structure	created	in	the	last	recipe, Creating	an	extension-based	REST	interface,	into	a	full-fledged	RESTful	API.   Getting	ready  We	will	take	the	API	skeleton	from	the	last	recipe	as	a	basis	for	creating	a complete	functional	SQLAlchemy-independent	RESTful	API.	Although	we	will use	SQLAlchemy	as	the	ORM	for	demonstration	purposes,	this	recipe	can	be written	in	a	similar	fashion	for	any	ORM	or	underlying	database.   How	to	do	it...  The	following	lines	of	code	are	the	complete	RESTful	API	for	the	Product	model. These	code	snippets	will	go	into	the	views.py	file.  Start	with	imports	and	add	parser:  import	json from	flask	import	abort from	flask_restful	import	reqparse	 	 parser	=	reqparse.RequestParser  	 parser.add_argument 'name',	type=str 	 parser.add_argument 'price',	type=float 	 parser.add_argument 'category',	type=dict 	  In	the	preceding	snippet,	we	created	parser	for	the	arguments	that	we	expected	to have	in	our	requests	for	POST	and	PUT.	The	request	expects	each	of	the	arguments to	have	a	value.	If	a	value	is	missing	for	any	argument,	then	None	is	used	as	the value.  Write	the	method	as	shown	in	the	following	code	block	to	fetch	products:  class	ProductApi Resource :	 	 				def	get self,	id=None,	page=1 :	 								if	not	id:	 												products	=	Product.query.paginate page,	10 .items	 								else:	 												products	=	[Product.query.get id ]	 								if	not	products:	 												abort 404 	 								res	=	{}	 								for	product	in	products:	 												res[product.id]	=	{	 																'name':	product.name,	 																'price':	product.price,	 																'category':	product.category.name	 												}	 								return	json.dumps res 	  The	preceding	get  	method	corresponds	to	GET	requests	and	returns	a	paginated list	of	products	if	no	id	is	passed;	otherwise,	it	returns	the	corresponding	product.  Create	the	following	method	to	add	a	new	product:  				def	post self :	 								args	=	parser.parse_args  	   The	preceding	post  	method	will	lead	to	the	creation	of	a	new	product	by making	a	POST	request.  Write	the	following	method	to	update	or	essentially	replace	an	existing	product record:  								args	=	parser.parse_args  	 								name	=	args['name']	 								price	=	args['price']	 								categ_name	=	args['category']['name']	 								category	=	Category.query.filter_by 											 name=categ_name .first  	 								if	not	category:	 												category	=	Category categ_name 	 								product	=	Product name,	price,	category 	 								db.session.add product 	 								db.session.commit  	 								res	=	{}	 								res[product.id]	=	{	 												'name':	product.name,	 												'price':	product.price,	 												'category':	product.category.name,	 								}	 								return	json.dumps res 	  				def	put self,	id :	 								args	=	parser.parse_args  	 								name	=	args['name']	 								price	=	args['price']	 								categ_name	=	args['category']['name']	 								category	=	Category.query.filter_by 											 name=categ_name .first  	 								Product.query.filter_by id=id .update {	 												'name':	name,	 												'price':	price,	 												'category_id':	category.id,	 								} 	 								db.session.commit  	 								product	=	Product.query.get_or_404 id 	 								res	=	{}	 								res[product.id]	=	{	 												'name':	product.name,	 												'price':	product.price,	 												'category':	product.category.name,	 								}	 								return	json.dumps res 	  In	the	preceding	code,	we	updated	an	existing	product	using	a	PUT	request.	Here, we	should	provide	all	the	arguments	even	if	we	intend	to	change	a	few	of	them. This	is	because	of	the	conventional	way	in	which	PUT	has	been	defined	to	work. If	we	want	to	have	a	request	where	we	intend	to	pass	only	those	arguments	that we	intend	to	update,	then	we	should	use	a	PATCH	request.  Delete	a	product	using	the	following	method:  				def	delete self,	id :	   				def	delete self,	id :	 								product	=	Product.query.filter_by id=id 	 								product.delete  	 								db.session.commit  	 								return	json.dumps {'response':	'Success'} 	  Last,	but	not	least,	we	have	the	DELETE	request,	which	will	simply	delete	the product	that	matches	the	id	passed.  The	following	is	a	definition	of	all	the	possible	routes	that	our	API	can accommodate:  api.add_resource 	 				ProductApi,	 				' api product',	 				' api product  ',	 				' api product    '	  	   How	it	works...  To	test	and	see	how	this	works,	we	can	send	a	number	of	requests	using	the Python	shell	by	means	of	the	requests	library:  				>>>	import	requests 				>>>	import	json 				>>>	res	=	requests.get 'http:  127.0.0.1:5000 api product'  				>>>	res.json   				{'message':	'The	requested	URL	was	not	found	on	the	server.	If	you	entered	the	URL	manually	please	check	your	spelling	and	try	again.'}  We	made	a	GET	request	to	fetch	the	list	of	products,	but	there	is	no	record	of	this. Let's	create	a	new	product	now:  	>>>	d	=	{'name':	u'iPhone',	'price':	549.00,	'category':	{'name':'Phones'}} 	>>>	res	=	requests.post 'http:  127.0.0.1:5000 api product',	data=json.	dumps d ,	headers={'Content-Type':	'application json'}  	>>>	res.json  	 				'{"1":	{"name":	"iPhone",	"price":	549.0,	"category":	"Phones"}}'  We	sent	a	POST	request	to	create	a	product	with	some	data.	Notice	the	headers argument	in	the	request.	Each	POST	request	sent	in	Flask-Restful	should	have	this header.	Now,	we	should	look	for	the	list	of	products	again:  				>>>	res	=	requests.get 'http:  127.0.0.1:5000 api product'  				>>>	res.json   				'{"1":	{"name":	"iPhone",	"price":	549.0,	"category":	"Phones"}}'  If	we	look	for	the	products	again	via	a	GET	request,	we	can	see	that	we	now	have a	newly	created	product	in	the	database.  I	will	leave	it	to	you	to	try	to	incorporate	other	API	requests	by	themselves.  An	important	facet	of	RESTful	APIs	is	the	use	of	token-based	authentication	to	allow	only limited	and	authenticated	users	to	be	able	to	use	and	make	calls	to	the	API.	I	urge	readers	to explore	this	on	their	own.	We	covered	the	basics	of	user	authentication	in	Chapter	6, Authenticating	in	Flask,	which	will	serve	as	a	basis	for	this	concept.   Admin	Interface	for	Flask	Apps  Many	applications	require	an	interface	that	provides	special	privileges	to	some users	and	can	be	used	to	maintain	and	upgrade	an	application's	resources.	For example,	we	can	have	an	interface	in	an	e-commerce	application	that	will	allow some	special	users	to	create	categories,	products,	and	more.	Some	users	might have	permissions	to	handle	other	users	who	shop	on	the	website,	deal	with	their account	information,	and	so	on.	Similarly,	there	can	be	many	cases	where	we will	need	to	isolate	some	parts	of	the	interface	of	our	application	from	normal users.  In	comparison	to	the	very	popular	Python-based	web	framework,	Django,	Flask does	not	provide	any	admin	interface	by	default.	Although	this	can	be	seen	as	a shortcoming	by	many,	this	gives	developers	the	flexibility	to	create	the	admin interface	as	per	their	requirements	and	have	complete	control	over	the application.  We	can	choose	to	write	an	admin	interface	for	our	application	from	scratch	or use	an	extension	of	Flask,	which	does	most	of	the	work	for	us	and	gives	us	the option	to	customize	the	logic	as	needed.	One	very	popular	extension	for	creating admin	interfaces	in	Flask	is	Flask-Admin	 https:  pypi.python.org pypi Flask-Admin .	It is	inspired	by	the	Django	admin,	but	is	implemented	in	a	way	that	gives	the developer	complete	control	over	the	look,	feel,	and	functionality	of	the application.	In	this	chapter,	we	will	start	with	the	creation	of	an	admin	interface on	our	own,	and	then	move	on	to	using	the	Flask-Admin	extension	and	fine-tuning this	as	needed.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Creating	a	simple	Create,	Read,	Update,	and	Delete	 CRUD 	interface Using	the	Flask-Admin	extension Registering	models	with	Flask-Admin Creating	custom	forms	and	actions Using	a	What	You	See	Is	What	You	Get	 WYSIWYG 	editor	for	textarea integration Creating	user	roles   Creating	a	simple	CRUD	interface CRUD	refers	to	Create,	Read,	Update,	and	Delete.	A	basic	necessity	of	an admin	interface	is	to	have	the	ability	to	create,	modify,	or	delete	the records resources	from	the	application	as	and	when	needed.	We	will	create	a simple	admin	interface	that	will	allow	admin	users	to	perform	these	operations on	the	records	that	other	normal	users	generally	can't.   Getting	ready  We	will	start	with	our	authentication	application	from	the	Authenticating	using the	Flask-Login	extension	recipe	in	Chapter	6,	Authenticating	in	Flask,	and	add admin	authentication	and	an	interface	for	admins	to	this,	to	allow	only	the	admin users	to	create,	update,	and	delete	user	records.	Here,	in	this	recipe,	I	will	cover some	specific	parts	that	are	necessary	to	understand	the	concepts.	For	the complete	application,	you	can	refer	to	the	code	samples	available	with	the	book.   How	to	do	it...  To	create	a	simple	admin	interface,	perform	the	following	steps:  1.	 Start	with	the	models	by	adding	a	new	BooleanField	field	called	admin	to	the User	model	in	auth models.py.	This	field	will	help	in	identifying	whether	the user	is	an	admin	or	not:  from	wtforms	import	BooleanField	 	 class	User db.Model :	 			id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	primary_key=True 	 				username	=	db.Column db.String 60  	 				pwdhash	=	db.Column db.String   	 				admin	=	db.Column db.Boolean   	 	 				def	__init__ self,	username,	password,	admin=False :	 								self.username	=	username	 								self.pwdhash	=	generate_password_hash password 	 								self.admin	=	admin	 	 				def	is_admin self :	 								return	self.admin	  The	preceding	method	simply	returns	the	value	of	the	admin	field.	This	can have	a	custom	implementation	as	per	our	requirements.	  Since	this	is	a	new	field	being	added	to	the	User	model,	database	migration	should	be	done. You	can	refer	to	the	Migrating	databases	using	Alembic	and	Flask-Migrate	recipe	in	Chapter 3,	Data	Modeling	in	Flask,	for	more	details.  2.	 Create	two	forms	that	will	be	used	by	the	admin	views	in	auth models.py:  class	AdminUserCreateForm FlaskForm :	 				username	=	StringField 'Username',	[InputRequired  ] 	 				password	=	PasswordField 'Password',	[InputRequired  ] 	 				admin	=	BooleanField 'Is	Admin	?' 	 	 	 class	AdminUserUpdateForm FlaskForm :	 				username	=	StringField 'Username',	[InputRequired  ] 	 				admin	=	BooleanField 'Is	Admin	?' 	  3.	 Now,	modify	the	views	in	auth views.py	to	implement	the	admin	interface:  from	flask	import	abort from	functools	import	wraps	 from	my_app.auth.models	import	AdminUserCreateForm,	AdminUserUpdateForm	 	 def	admin_login_required func :	   def	admin_login_required func :	 				@wraps func 	 				def	decorated_view *args,	**kwargs :	 								if	not	current_user.is_admin  :	 												return	abort 403 	 								return	func *args,	**kwargs 	 				return	decorated_view  The	preceding	code	is	the	admin_login_required	decorator	that	works	just like	the	login_required	decorator.	Here,	the	difference	is	that	it	needs	to	be implemented	along	with	login_required,	and	it	checks	whether	the currently	logged-in	user	is	an	admin.  4.	 Create	the	following	handlers	that	will	be	needed	to	create	a	simple	admin interface.	Note	the	usage	of	the	@admin_login_required	decorator.	Everything else	is	pretty	much	standard,	as	we	learned	in	the	previous	chapters	of	this book	that	focused	on	views	and	authentication	handling.	All	the	handlers will	go	in	auth views.py:  @auth.route ' admin' 	 @login_required	 @admin_login_required	 def	home_admin  :	 				return	render_template 'admin-home.html' 	 	 @auth.route ' admin users-list' 	 @login_required	 @admin_login_required	 def	users_list_admin  :	 				users	=	User.query.all  	 				return	render_template 'users-list-admin.html',	users=users 	 	 @auth.route ' admin create-user',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 @login_required	 @admin_login_required	 def	user_create_admin  :	 				form	=	AdminUserCreateForm  	 	 				if	form.validate_on_submit  :	 								username	=	form.username.data	 								password	=	form.password.data	 								admin	=	form.admin.data	 								existing_username	=	User.query.filter_by 											 username=username .first  	 								if	existing_username:	 												flash 	 																'This	username	has	been	already	taken.	Try	another 																	one.',	'warning'	 												 	 												return	render_template 'register.html',	form=form 	 								user	=	User username,	password,	admin 	 								db.session.add user 	 								db.session.commit  	 								flash 'New	User	Created.',	'info' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'auth.users_list_admin'  	 	 				if	form.errors:	 								flash form.errors,	'danger' 	   								flash form.errors,	'danger' 	 	 				return	render_template 'user-create-admin.html',	form=form 	  The	preceding	method	allows	admin	users	to	create	new	users	in	the system.	This	works	in	a	manner	that	is	pretty	similar	to	the	register   method,	but	allows	the	admin	to	set	the	admin	flag	on	the	user.  The	method	below	allows	the	admin	users	to	update	the	records	of	other users:  @auth.route ' admin update-user  ',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 @login_required	 @admin_login_required	 def	user_update_admin id :	 				user	=	User.query.get id 	 				form	=	AdminUserUpdateForm 	 								username=user.username,	 								admin=user.admin	 				 	 	 				if	form.validate_on_submit  :	 								username	=	form.username.data	 								admin	=	form.admin.data	 	 								User.query.filter_by id=id .update {	 												'username':	username,	 												'admin':	admin,	 								} 	 	 								db.session.commit  	 								flash 'User	Updated.',	'info' 	 								return	redirect url_for 'auth.users_list_admin'  	 	 				if	form.errors:	 								flash form.errors,	'danger' 	 	 				return	render_template 'user-update-admin.html',	form=form,	 							user=user   However,	as	per	the	best	practices	of	writing	web	applications,	we	do	not allow	the	admin	to	simply	view	and	change	the	passwords	of	any	user.	In most	cases,	the	provision	to	change	passwords	should	rest	with	the	user who	owns	the	account.	Although	admins	can	have	the	provision	to update	the	password	in	some	cases,	still,	it	should	never	be	possible	for them	to	see	the	passwords	set	by	the	user	earlier.	This	topic	is	discussed in	the	Creating	custom	forms	and	actions	recipe.  The	method	below	handles	deletion	of	a	user	by	admin:  @auth.route ' admin delete-user  ' 	 @login_required	 @admin_login_required	   @admin_login_required	 def	user_delete_admin id :	 				user	=	User.query.get id 	 				db.session.delete user 	 				db.session.commit  	 				flash 'User	Deleted.',	'info' 	 				return	redirect url_for 'auth.users_list_admin'  	  The	user_delete_admin  	method	should	actually	be	implemented	on	a	POST request.	This	is	left	to	the	readers	to	implement	by	themselves.  5.	 Followed	by	models	and	views,	create	some	templates	to	complement	them.  It	might	have	been	evident	to	many	of	us	from	the	code	of	the	views	itself that	we	need	to	add	four	new	templates,	namely,	admin-home.html,	user-create- admin.html,	user-update-admin.html,	and	users-list-admin.html.	How	these	work	is shown	in	the	next	section.	You	should	now	be	able	to	implement	these templates	by	themselves;	however,	for	reference,	the	code	is	always available	with	the	samples	provided	with	the	book.   How	it	works...  To	begin,	we	added	a	menu	item	to	the	application;	this	provides	a	direct	link	to the	admin	home	page,	which	will	look	like	the	following	screenshot:  A	user	must	be	logged	in	as	the	admin	to	access	this	page	and	other	admin- related	pages.	If	a	user	is	not	logged	in	as	the	admin,	then	the	application	will show	an	error,	as	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:  Create	an	admin	user	before	you	can	login	as	the	admin.	To	create	an	admin	user,	you	can either	make	DB	changes	in	SQLAlchemy	from	the	command	line	using	SQL	queries.	Another simpler	but	hacky	way	of	doing	this	is	to	change	the	admin	flag	to	True	in	auth models.py	and	then register	a	new	user.	This	new	user	will	be	an	admin	user.	Make	sure	that	you	revert	the	admin flag	to	False	as	the	default	after	this	is	done.  To	a	logged-in	admin	user,	the	admin	home	page	will	look	as	follows:   From	here,	the	admin	can	see	the	list	of	users	on	a	system	or	create	a	new	user. The	options	to	edit	or	delete	the	users	will	be	available	on	the	user	list	page itself.   Using	the	Flask-Admin	extension  Flask-Admin	is	an	available	extension	that	helps	in	the	creation	of	admin	interfaces for	our	application	in	a	simpler	and	faster	way.	All	the	subsequent	recipes	in	this chapter	will	focus	on	using	and	extending	this	extension.   Getting	ready  First,	we	need	to	install	the	Flask-Admin	extension:  				$	pip3	install	Flask-Admin	  We	will	extend	our	application	from	the	previous	recipe	and	keep	building	on this.   How	to	do	it...  Adding	a	simple	admin	interface	to	any	Flask	application	using	the	Flask-Admin extension	is	just	a	matter	of	a	couple	of	statements:  1.	 Simply	add	the	following	lines	to	the	application's	configuration	in  my_app __init__.py:  from	flask_admin	import	Admin	 	 app	=	Flask __name__ 	 	 	Add	any	other	application	configuration	 	 admin	=	Admin app 	  2.	 You	can	also	add	your	own	views	to	this;	this	is	as	simple	as	adding	a	new  class	as	a	new	view	that	inherits	from	the	BaseView	class,	as	shown	in	the following	code	block.	This	code	block	goes	in	auth views.py:  from	flask_admin	import	BaseView,	expose	 	 class	HelloView BaseView :	 				@expose ' ' 	 				def	index self :	 								return	self.render 'some-template.html' 	  After	this,	add	this	view	to	the	admin	object	in	the	Flask	configuration in	my_app __init__.py:  import	my_app.auth.views	as	views	 	 admin.add_view views.HelloView name='Hello'  	  One	thing	to	notice	here	is	that	this	page	does	not	have	any	authentication	or authorization	logic	implemented	by	default,	and	it	will	be	accessible	to	all.	The reason	for	this	is	that	Flask-Admin	does	not	make	any	assumptions	about	the authentication	system	in	place.	As	we	are	using	Flask-Login	for	our	applications, you	can	add	a	method	named	is_accessible  	to	your	HelloView	class:  def	is_accessible self :	 				return	current_user.is_authenticated	and	current_user.is_admin     How	it	works...  Just	initializing	an	application	with	the	Admin	class	from	the	Flask-Admin	extension, as	demonstrated	in	the	first	step	of	this	recipe,	will	put	up	a	basic	admin	page,	as shown	in	the	following	screenshot:  The	admin	page	as	created	by	Flask-Admin  Notice	the	URL	in	the	screenshot,	which	is	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 admin .  The	addition	of	the	custom	HelloView	in	the	second	step	will	make	the	admin	page look	like	the	following	screenshot:   There's	more...  After	implementing	the	preceding	code,	there	is	still	an	admin	view	that	won't	be completely	user-protected	and	will	be	publicly	available.	This	will	be	the	admin home	page.	To	make	this	available	only	to	the	admins,	we	have	to	inherit	from AdminIndexView	and	implement	is_accessible  :  from	flask_admin	import	AdminIndexView	 	 class	MyAdminIndexView AdminIndexView :	 				def	is_accessible self :	 								return	current_user.is_authenticated	and	current_user.is_admin  	  Then,	just	pass	this	view	to	the	admin	object	in	the	application's	configuration	as index_view,	and	we	are	done:  admin	=	Admin app,	index_view=views.MyAdminIndexView     This	approach	makes	all	our	admin	views	accessible	only	to	the	admin	users.	We can	also	implement	any	permission	or	conditional	access	rules	in	is_accessible   as	and	when	required.   Registering	models	with	Flask-Admin  In	the	previous	recipe,	we	learned	how	to	get	started	with	the	Flask-Admin extension	to	create	admin	interfaces views	for	our	application.	In	this	recipe,	we will	examine	how	to	implement	admin	views	for	our	existing	models	with	the facilities	to	perform	CRUD	operations.   Getting	ready  We	will	extend	our	application	from	the	previous	recipe	to	include	an	admin interface	for	the	User	model.   How	to	do	it...  Again,	with	Flask-Admin,	registering	a	model	with	the	admin	interface	is	very	easy; perform	the	following	steps:  1.	 Just	add	the	following	single	line	of	code	to	auth views.py:  from	flask_admin.contrib.sqla	import	ModelView	 	 	Other	admin	configuration	as	shown	in	last	recipe	 admin.add_view ModelView views.User,	db.session  	  Here,	in	the	first	line,	we	imported	ModelView	from	flask_admin.contrib.sqla, which	is	provided	by	Flask-Admin	to	integrate	SQLAlchemy	models.  Looking	at	the	screenshot	corresponding	to	the	first	step	in	the	next section,	most	of	us	will	agree	that	showing	the	password	hash	to	any user,	be	it	an	admin	or	a	normal	user,	does	not	make	sense.	Additionally, the	default	model-creation	mechanism	provided	by	Flask-Admin	will	fail	for our	User	creation,	because	we	have	an	__init__  	method	in	our	User	model. This	method	expects	values	for	the	three	fields,	while	the	model-creation logic	implemented	in	Flask-Admin	is	very	generic	and	does	not	provide	any value	during	model	creation.  2.	 Now,	customize	the	default	behavior	of	Flask-Admin	to	something	of	your  own,	where	you	fix	the	User	creation	mechanism	and	hide	the	password	hash from	view	in	auth views.py:  from	werkzeug.security	import	generate_password_hash,	check_password_hash from	wtforms	import	PasswordField from	flask_admin.contrib.sqla	import	ModelView  class	UserAdminView ModelView :	 				column_searchable_list	=	 'username', 	 				column_sortable_list	=	 'username',	'admin' 	 				column_exclude_list	=	 'pwdhash', 	 				form_excluded_columns	=	 'pwdhash', 	 				form_edit_rules	=	 'username',	'admin' 	 	 				def	is_accessible self :	 								return	current_user.is_authenticated	and	 											current_user.is_admin  	  The	preceding	code	shows	some	rules	and	settings	that	our	admin	view   for	User	will	follow.	These	are	self-explanatory	via	their	names.	A	couple of	them,	column_exclude_list	and	form_excluded_columns,	might	appear	to	be slightly	confusing.	The	former	will	exclude	the	columns	mentioned	from the	admin	view	itself	and	refrain	from	using	them	in	search,	creation,	and other	CRUD	operations.	The	latter	will	prevent	the	field	from	being shown	on	the	form	for	CRUD	operations.  3.	 Create	a	method	in	auth views.py	that	overrides	the	creation	of	the	form	from  the	model	and	adds	a	password	field,	which	will	be	used	in	place	of	the password	hash:  				def	scaffold_form self :	 								form_class	=	super UserAdminView,	self .scaffold_form  	 								form_class.password	=	PasswordField 'Password' 	 								return	form_class  4.	 Then,	override	the	model-creation	logic	in	auth views.py	to	suit	the  application:  				def	create_model self,	form :	 								model	=	self.model 	 												form.username.data,	form.password.data,	 															form.admin.data	 								 	 								form.populate_obj model 	 								self.session.add model 	 								self._on_model_change form,	model,	True 	 								self.session.commit  	  5.	 Finally,	add	this	model	to	the	admin	object	in	the	application	config	in  my_app __init__.py	by	writing	the	following:  admin.add_view views.UserAdminView views.User,	db.session  	 Notice	the	self._on_model_change form,	model,	True 	statement.	Here,	the	last	parameter,	True, signifies	that	the	call	is	for	the	creation	of	a	new	record.   How	it	works...  The	first	step	will	create	a	new	admin	view	for	the	User	model,	which	will	look like	the	following	screenshot:  After	all	the	steps	have	been	followed,	the	admin	interface	for	the	User	model	will look	like	the	following	screenshot:   We	have	a	search	box	here,	and	no	password	hash	is	visible.	There	are	changes to	the	user	creation	and	edit	views	too.	I	recommend	that	you	run	the	application to	see	this	for	yourself.   Creating	custom	forms	and	actions  In	this	recipe,	we	will	create	custom	forms	using	the	forms	provided	by	Flask- Admin.	Additionally,	we	will	create	a	custom	action	using	the	custom	form.   Getting	ready  In	the	previous	recipe,	we	saw	that	the	edit	form	view	for	the	User	record	update had	no	option	to	update	the	password	for	the	user.	The	form	looked	like	the following	screenshot:  In	this	recipe,	we	will	customize	this	form	to	allow	administrators	to	update	the password	for	any	user.   How	to	do	it...  The	implementation	of	this	feature	will	only	require	changes	to	views.py:  1.	 First,	start	by	importing	rules	from	the	Flask-Admin	form:  from	flask_admin.form	import	rules	  In	the	previous	recipe,	we	had	form_edit_rules,	which	had	just	two	fields; that	is,	username	and	admin	as	a	list.	This	denoted	the	fields	that	will	be available	for	editing	to	the	admin	user	in	the	User	model's	update	view.  2.	 Updating	the	password	is	not	simply	a	case	of	just	adding	one	more	field	to the	list	of	form_edit_rules;	this	is	because	we	do	not	store	cleartext	passwords. Instead,	we	store	password	hashes	that	cannot	be	edited	directly	by	users. We	need	to	input	the	password	from	the	user	and	then	convert	it	to	a	hash while	storing.	Take	a	look	at	how	to	do	this	in	the	following	code:  form_edit_rules	=	 	 				'username',	'admin',	 				rules.Header 'Reset	Password' ,	 				'new_password',	'confirm'	  	 form_create_rules	=	 	 				'username',	'admin',	'notes',	'password'	    The	preceding	piece	of	code	signifies	that	we	now	have	a	header	in	our form;	this	header	separates	the	password	reset	section	from	the	rest	of	the section.	Then,	add	two	new	fields,	new_password	and	confirm,	which	will	help us	safely	change	the	password.  3.	 This	also	calls	for	change	to	the	scaffold_form  	method	so	that	the	two	new  fields	become	valid	while	form-rendering:  def	scaffold_form self :	 				form_class	=	super UserAdminView,	self .scaffold_form  	 				form_class.password	=	PasswordField 'Password' 	 				form_class.new_password	=	PasswordField 'New	Password' 	 				form_class.confirm	=	PasswordField 'Confirm	New	Password' 	 				return	form_class	  4.	 Finally,	implement	the	update_model  	method,	which	is	called	when	we	try	to   update	the	record:  def	update_model self,	form,	model :	 				form.populate_obj model 	 				if	form.new_password.data:	 								if	form.new_password.data	!=	form.confirm.data:	 												flash 'Passwords	must	match' 	 												return	 								model.pwdhash	=	generate_password_hash 											 form.new_password.data 	 				self.session.add model 	 				self._on_model_change form,	model,	False 	 				self.session.commit  	  In	the	preceding	code,	we	will	first	make	sure	that	the	password	entered in	both	the	fields	is	the	same.	If	yes,	then	we	will	proceed	with	resetting the	password,	along	with	any	other	change.  Notice	the	self._on_model_change form,	model,	False 	statement.	Here,	False,	as	the	last	parameter, signifies	that	the	call	is	not	for	the	creation	of	a	new	record.	This	is	also	used	in	the	last recipe,	where	we	created	the	user.	In	that	case,	the	last	parameter	was	set	to	True.   How	it	works...  The	user	update	form	will	now	look	like	the	following	screenshot:  Here,	if	we	enter	the	same	password	in	both	of	the	password	fields,	the	user password	will	be	updated.   Using	a	WYSIWYG	editor	for textarea	integration  As	users	of	websites,	we	all	know	that	writing	beautiful	formatted	text	using	the normal	textarea	fields	is	a	nightmare.	There	are	plugins	that	make	our	life	easier and	turn	simple	textarea	fields	into	WYSIWYG	editors.	One	such	editor	is CKEditor.	It	is	open	source,	provides	good	flexibility,	and	has	a	huge community	for	support.	Additionally,	it	is	customizable	and	allows	users	to	build add-ons	as	needed.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	understand	how	CKEditor	can	be leveraged	to	build	beautiful	textarea	fields.   Getting	ready  We	start	by	adding	a	new	textarea	field	to	our	User	model	for	notes,	and	then integrating	this	field	with	CKEditor	to	write	formatted	text.	This	will	include	the addition	of	a	JavaScript	library	and	a	CSS	class	to	a	normal	textarea	field	to convert	this	into	a	CKEditor-compatible	textarea	field.   How	to	do	it...  To	integrate	CKEditor	with	your	application,	perform	the	following	steps:  1.	 First,	add	the	notes	field	to	the	User	model	in	auth models.py,	as	follows:  class	User db.Model :	 				id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	primary_key=True 	 				username	=	db.Column db.String 60  	 				pwdhash	=	db.Column db.String   	 				admin	=	db.Column db.Boolean   	 				notes	=	db.Column db.UnicodeText 	 	 				def	__init__ self,	username,	password,	admin=False,	notes='' :	 								self.username	=	username	 								self.pwdhash	=	generate_password_hash password 	 								self.admin	=	admin	 								self.notes	=	notes	  In	order	to	add	a	new	field,	you	might	need	to	run	migration	scripts.	You	can	refer	to	the Migrating	databases	using	Alembic	and	Flask-Migrate	recipe	in	Chapter	3,	Data	Modeling	in Flask,	for	more	details.  2.	 After	this,	create	a	custom	wtform	widget	and	field	for	a	CKEditor	textarea  field	in	auth models.py:  from	wtforms	import	widgets,	TextAreaField	 	 class	CKTextAreaWidget widgets.TextArea :	 				def	__call__ self,	field,	**kwargs :	 								kwargs.setdefault 'class_',	'ckeditor' 	 								return	super CKTextAreaWidget,	self .__call__ field,	 											**kwargs   In	the	custom	widget	in	the	preceding	code,	we	added	a	ckeditor	class	to our	TextArea	widget.	For	more	insights	into	the	WTForm	widgets,	you	can refer	to	the	Creating	a	custom	widget	recipe	in	Chapter	5,	Webforms	with WTForms.  3.	 Next,	create	a	custom	field	that	inherits	TextAreaField	and	updates	it	to	use  the	widget	created	in	the	previous	step:  class	CKTextAreaField TextAreaField :	 				widget	=	CKTextAreaWidget  	  In	the	custom	field	in	the	preceding	code,	we	set	the	widget	to CKTextAreaWidget,	and	when	this	field	will	be	rendered,	the	ckeditor	CSS   class	will	be	added	to	it.  4.	 Next,	modify	form_edit_rules	in	the	UserAdminView	class	in	auth views.py,	where  we	specify	the	template	to	be	used	for	the	create	and	edit	forms. Additionally,	override	the	normal	TextAreaField	object	with	CKTextAreaField	for notes.	Make	sure	that	you	import	CKTextAreaField	from	auth models.py:  form_overrides	=	dict notes=CKTextAreaField 	 	 create_template	=	'edit.html'	 edit_template	=	'edit.html'	  In	the	preceding	code	block,	form_overrides	enables	the	overriding	of	a normal	textarea	field	with	the	CKEditor	textarea	field.  5.	 The	final	part	of	this	recipe	is	the	templates edit.html	template	that	was  mentioned	earlier:  {%	extends	'admin model edit.html'	%}	 		 {%	block	tail	%}	 				{{	super  	}}	 				<script	src="http:  cdnjs.cloudflare.com ajax  							libs ckeditor 4.0.1 ckeditor.js"> 	 {%	endblock	%}	  Here,	we	extend	the	default	edit.html	file	provided	by	Flask-Admin	and	add the	CKEditor	JS	file	so	that	our	ckeditor	class	in	CKTextAreaField	works.   How	it	works...  After	we	have	made	all	the	changes,	the	create	user	form	will	look	like	the following	screenshot;	in	particular,	notice	the	Notes	field:   Here,	anything	entered	in	the	Notes	field	will	be	automatically	formatted	in HTML	while	saving,	and	can	be	used	anywhere	later	for	display	purposes.   See	also  This	recipe	is	inspired	from	the	gist	by	the	author	of	Flask-Admin.	The	gist	can	be found	at	https:  gist.github.com mrjoes 5189850.   Creating	user	roles  So	far,	we	have	discovered	how	a	view	that	is	accessible	to	a	certain	set	of admin	users	can	be	created	easily	using	the	is_accessible  	method.	This	can	be extended	to	have	different	kinds	of	scenarios,	where	specific	users	will	be	able	to view	specific	views.	There	is	another	way	of	implementing	user	roles	at	a	much more	granular	level	in	a	model,	where	the	roles	determine	whether	a	user	can perform	all,	some,	or	any	of	the	CRUD	operations.   Getting	ready  In	this	recipe,	we	will	explore	a	basic	way	of	creating	user	roles,	where	an	admin user	can	only	perform	actions	they	are	entitled	to.  Remember	that	this	is	just	one	way	of	implementing	user	roles.	There	are	a	number	of	better ways	of	doing	this,	but	this	one	appears	to	be	the	best	one	to	demonstrate	the	concept	of creating	user	roles.	One	such	method	would	be	to	create	user	groups	and	assign	roles	to	the groups,	rather	than	individual	users.	Another	method	can	be	the	more	complex	policy-based user	roles,	which	will	include	defining	the	roles	according	to	complex	business	logic.	This approach	is	usually	employed	by	business	systems	such	as	ERP,	CRM,	and	more.   How	to	do	it...  To	add	basic	user	roles	to	the	application,	perform	the	following	steps:  1.	 First,	add	a	field	named	roles	to	the	User	model	in	auth models.py,	as	follows:  class	User db.Model :	 				id	=	db.Column db.Integer,	primary_key=True 	 				username	=	db.Column db.String 60  	 				pwdhash	=	db.Column db.String   	 				admin	=	db.Column db.Boolean   	 				notes	=	db.Column db.UnicodeText 	 				roles	=	db.Column db.String 4  	 	 				def	__init__ self,	username,	password,	admin=False,	notes='',	 							roles='R' :	 								self.username	=	username	 								self.pwdhash	=	generate_password_hash password 	 								self.admin	=	admin	 								self.notes	=	notes	 								self.roles	=	self.admin	and	roles	or	''	 In	order	to	add	a	new	field,	you	might	need	to	run	migration	scripts.	You	can	refer	to	the Migrating	databases	using	Alembic	and	Flask-Migrate	recipe	in	Chapter	3,	Data	Modeling	in Flask,	for	more	details.  Here,	we	added	a	new	field,	roles,	that	is	a	string	field	of	length	4.	We assumed	that	the	only	entries	that	are	possible	in	this	field	are	any combinations	of	C,	R,	U,	and	D.	A	user	with	the	roles	value	as	CRUD	will	have the	permission	to	perform	all	the	actions,	while	any	missing	permissions will	prevent	the	user	from	performing	that	action.	Note	that	read permissions	are	always	implied	to	any	admin	user,	whether	specified	or not.  2.	 Next,	make	some	changes	to	the	UserAdminView	class	in	auth views.py:  from	flask_admin.actions	import	ActionsMixin	 	 class	UserAdminView ModelView,	ActionsMixin :	 	 				form_edit_rules	=	 	 								'username',	'admin',	'roles',	'notes',	 								rules.Header 'Reset	Password' ,	 								'new_password',	'confirm'	 				 	 				form_create_rules	=	 	 								'username',	'admin',	'roles',	'notes',	'password'	 				 	   In	the	preceding	code,	we	just	added	the	roles	field	to	our	create	and	edit forms.	We	also	inherited	from	a	class	called	ActionsMixin.	This	is	necessary to	handle	the	mass	update	actions	such	as	mass	deletion.  3.	 Next,	we	have	the	methods	that	we	need	to	implement	conditions	and  handle	logic	for	various	roles:  				def	create_model self,	form :	 								if	'C'	not	in	current_user.roles:	 												flash 'You	are	not	allowed	to	create	users.',	 															'warning' 	 												return	 								model	=	self.model 	 												form.username.data,	form.password.data,	 													form.admin.data,	 												form.notes.data	 								 	 								form.populate_obj model 	 								self.session.add model 	 								self._on_model_change form,	model,	True 	 								self.session.commit  	  In	this	method,	we	first	checked	whether	the	roles	field	in	current_user	has the	permission	to	create	records	 this	is	denoted	by	C .	If	not,	we	show	an error	message	and	return	from	the	method.	  				def	update_model self,	form,	model :	 								if	'U'	not	in	current_user.roles:	 												flash 'You	are	not	allowed	to	edit	users.',	'warning' 	 												return	 								form.populate_obj model 	 								if	form.new_password.data:	 												if	form.new_password.data	!=	form.confirm.data:	 																flash 'Passwords	must	match' 	 																return	 												model.pwdhash	=	generate_password_hash 															 form.new_password.data 	 								self.session.add model 	 								self._on_model_change form,	model,	False 	 								self.session.commit  	  In	this	method,	we	first	checked	whether	the	roles	field	in	current_user	has permission	to	update	records	 this	is	denoted	by	U .	If	not,	we	show	an error	message	and	return	from	the	method.	  				def	delete_model self,	model :	 								if	'D'	not	in	current_user.roles:	 												flash 'You	are	not	allowed	to	delete	users.',	 															'warning' 	 												return	 								super UserAdminView,	self .delete_model model 	   Similarly,	here,	we	checked	whether	current_user	is	allowed	to	delete records.	  				def	is_action_allowed self,	name :	 								if	name	==	'delete'	and	'D'	not	in	current_user.roles:	 												flash 'You	are	not	allowed	to	delete	users.',	 															'warning' 	 												return	False	 								return	True	  In	the	preceding	method,	we	checked	whether	the	action	is	delete	and whether	current_user	is	allowed	to	delete.	If	not,	then	we	flash	the	error message	and	return	a	False	value.	This	method	can	be	extended	to	handle any	custom-written	actions	too.   How	it	works...  This	recipe	works	in	a	manner	that	is	very	similar	to	how	our	application	has been	working	so	far,	except	for	the	fact	that,	now,	users	with	designated	roles will	be	able	to	perform	specific	operations.	Otherwise,	error	messages	will	be displayed.  The	user	list	will	now	look	like	the	following	screenshot:  To	test	the	rest	of	the	functionality,	such	as	creating	new	users	 both	normal	and admin ,	deleting	users,	updating	user	records,	and	more,	I	urge	you	to	try	it	for yourself.   Internationalization	and	Localization  Web	applications	are	usually	not	limited	to	one	geographical	region	or	serve people	from	one	linguistic	domain.	For	example,	a	web	application	intended	for users	in	Europe	will	be	expected	to	support	other	European	languages,	such	as German,	French,	Italian,	and	Spanish,	apart	from	English.	This	chapter	will cover	the	basics	of	how	to	enable	support	for	multiple	languages	in	a	Flask application.  Adding	support	for	a	second	language	in	any	web	application	is	a	tricky	affair.	It increases	a	bit	of	overhead	every	time	some	change	is	made	to	the	application, and	this	increases	with	the	number	of	languages.	There	can	be	a	number	of things	that	need	to	be	taken	care	of,	apart	from	just	changing	the	text	as	per	the language.	Some	of	the	major	ones	are	currency,	number,	time,	and	date formatting.  Flask-Babel,	an	extension	that	adds	internationalization	 i18n  and	localization	 l10n 	support	to	any	Flask	application,	provides	a	number	of tools	and	techniques	to	make	this	process	simpler	and	easy	to	implement.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Adding	a	new	language Implementing	lazy	evaluation	and	the	gettext ngettext	functions Implementing	the	global	language	switching	action   Adding	a	new	language  By	default,	English	is	the	language	for	applications	built	in	Flask	 and	almost	all web	frameworks .	In	this	recipe,	we	will	add	a	second	language	to	our application	and	add	some	translations	for	the	display	strings	used	in	the application.	The	language	displayed	to	the	user	will	vary	depending	on	the language	that	is	currently	set	in	the	browser.   Getting	ready  We	will	start	with	the	installation	of	the	Flask-Babel	extension:  				$	pip3	install	Flask-Babel	  This	extension	uses	Babel,	pytz,	and	speaklater	to	add	i18n	and	l10n	support	to the	application.  We	will	use	our	catalog	application	from	Chapter	5,	Webforms	with	WTForms.   How	to	do	it...  We	will	use	French	as	the	second	language.	Follow	these	steps	in	order	to understand	how	to	achieve	this:  1.	 Start	with	the	configuration	part	by	creating	an	instance	of	the	Babel	class,  using	the	app	object	in	my_app __init__.py.	We	will	also	specify	all	the languages	that	will	be	available	here:  from	flask_babel	import	Babel	 	 ALLOWED_LANGUAGES	=	{	 			'en':	'English',	 				'fr':	'French',	 }	 babel	=	Babel app 	 Here,	we	used	en	and	fr	as	the	language	codes.	These	refer	to	English	 standard 	and French	 standard ,	respectively.	If	we	intend	to	support	multiple	languages	that	are	from the	same	standard	language	origin,	but	differ	on	the	basis	of	regions	such	as	English	 US  and	English	 GB ,	then	we	should	use	codes	such	as	en-us	and	en-gb.  2.	 Next,	create	a	file	in	the	application	folder	called	babel.cfg.	The	path	of	this  file	will	be	my_app babel.cfg,	and	it	will	have	the	following	content:  [python:	catalog **.py]	 [jinja2:	templates **.html]	 extensions=jinja2.ext.autoescape,jinja2.ext.with_	  Here,	the	first	two	lines	tell	Babel	about	the	filename	patterns	that	are	to be	searched	for	marked	translatable	text.	The	third	line	loads	a	number	of extensions	that	make	it	possible	to	search	for	text	in	the	files.  3.	 The	locale	of	the	application	depends	on	the	output	of	the	method	that	is  decorated	with	the	@babel.localeselector	decorator.	Add	the	following	method to	the	my_app catalog views.py	views	file:  from	my_app	import	babel,	ALLOWED_LANGUAGES	 	 @babel.localeselector	 def	get_locale  :	 				return	request.accept_languages.best_match ALLOWED_LANGUAGES.keys   	  The	preceding	method	gets	the	accept_languages	header	from	the	request and	finds	the	language	that	best	matches	the	languages	we	allow.   It	is	pretty	easy	to	change	the	language	preferences	in	the	browser.	However,	in	any	case,	if you	do	not	want	to	mess	with	the	language	preferences	of	the	browser,	simply	return	the expected	language	code	from	the	get_locale  	method.  4.	 Next,	mark	some	text	that	is	intended	to	be	translated	as	per	language.	Let's  start	with	the	first	text	we	see	when	we	start	our	application,	that	is,	in home.html:  {%	block	container	%}	  {{	_ 'Welcome	to	the	Catalog	Home' 	}} 	 		 	 		{{	_ 'Click	here	to	see	the	catalog	' 	}}	 		 	 {%	endblock	%}	  Here,	_	is	a	shortcut	for	the	gettext	function	provided	by	Babel	to	translate strings.  5.	 After	this,	run	the	following	commands	so	that	the	marked	text	is	actually  available	as	translated	text	in	our	template	when	it	is	rendered	in	the browser:  $	pybabel	extract	-F	my_app babel.cfg	-o	my_app messages.pot	 				my_app 	  The	preceding	command	traverses	through	the	content	of	the	files.	This command	matches	the	patterns	in	babel.cfg	and	picks	out	the	texts	that have	been	marked	as	translatable.	All	these	texts	are	placed	in	the my_app messages.pot	file.  6.	 Run	the	following	command	to	create	a	.po	file	that	will	hold	the  translations	for	the	texts	to	be	translated	into:  $	pybabel	init	-i	my_app messages.pot	-d	my_app translations	-l	fr	  This	file	is	created	in	the	specified	folder,	my_app translations,	as fr LC_MESSAGES messages.po.	As	we	add	more	languages,	more	folders	will	be added.  7.	 Now,	add	translations	to	the	messages.po	file.	This	can	be	performed  manually,	or	we	can	use	GUI	tools	such	as	Poedit	 http:  poedit.net  .	Using this	tool,	the	translations	will	look	like	the	following	screenshot:   How	a	Poedit	screen	appears	while	editing	translations  Manual	editing	of	messages.po	will	look	like	the	following	code.	Only	one message	translation	is	shown	for	demonstration	purposes:  :	my_app templates home.html:6	 msgid	"Click	here	to	see	the	catalog	"	 msgstr	"Cliquez	ici	pour	voir	le	catalogue	"	  8.	 Save	the	messages.po	file	after	the	translations	have	been	incorporated	and	run  the	following	command:  		$	pybabel	compile	-d	my_app translations	  This	will	create	a	messages.mo	file	next	to	the	message.po	file,	which	will	be used	by	the	application	to	render	the	translated	text.  Sometimes,	the	messages	do	not	get	compiled	after	running	the	preceding	command.	This	is because	the	messages	might	be	marked	as	fuzzy	 starting	with	a	 .	These	need	to	be	looked into	by	a	human,	and	the		sign	has	to	be	removed	if	the	message	is	OK	to	be	updated	by	the compiler.	To	bypass	this	check,	add	an	-f	flag	to	the	preceding	compile	command,	as	it	will force	everything	to	be	compiled.   How	it	works...  If	we	run	the	application	with	French	set	as	the	primary	language	in	the	browser, the	home	page	will	look	like	the	following	screenshot:  If	the	primary	language	is	set	to	a	language	other	than	French,	then	the	content will	be	shown	in	English,	which	is	the	default	language.  My	browser	language	settings	currently	look	like	the	ones	shown	in	the following	screenshot:   There's	more...  Next	time,	if	we	need	to	update	the	translations	in	our	messages.po	file,	we	do	not need	to	call	the	init	command	again.	Instead,	we	can	run	an	update	command, which	is	as	follows:  				$	pybabel	update	-i	my_app messages.pot	-d	my_app translations  After	this,	run	the	compile	command	as	usual.  It	is	often	preferable	to	change	the	language	of	a	website	based	on	the	user	IP	and	location  determined	from	the	IP .	However,	this	is	regarded	as	an	inferior	way	of	handling localization	as	compared	to	the	use	of	the	accept-language	header,	as	we	did	in	our application.   See	also  The	Implementing	the	global	language	switching	action	recipe,	which allows	the	user	to	change	the	language	directly	from	the	application	rather than	doing	it	at	the	browser	level. An	important	aspect	of	multiple	languages	is	to	be	able	to	format	the	date, time,	and	currency	accordingly.	Babel	also	handles	this	pretty	neatly.	I	urge readers	to	try	their	hands	at	this	by	themselves.	Refer	to	the	Babel documentation	available	at	http:  babel.pocoo.org en latest 	for	this.   Implementing	lazy	evaluation	and	the gettext ngettext	functions  Lazy	evaluation	is	an	evaluation	strategy	that	delays	the	evaluation	of	an expression	until	its	value	is	needed;	that	is,	it	is	a	call-by-need	mechanism.	In our	application,	there	can	be	several	instances	of	texts	that	are	evaluated	later while	rendering	the	template.	This	usually	happens	when	we	have	texts	that	are marked	as	translatable	outside	the	request	context,	so	we	defer	the	evaluation	of these	until	they	are	actually	needed.   Getting	ready  Let's	start	with	the	application	from	the	previous	recipe.	Now,	we	want	the	labels in	the	product	and	category	creation	forms	to	show	the	translated	values.   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	in	order	to	implement	the	lazy	evaluation	of	translations:  1.	 To	mark	all	the	field	labels	in	the	product	and	category	forms	as  translatable,	make	the	following	changes	to	my_app catalog models.py:  from	flask_babel	import	_	 	 class	NameForm FlaskForm :	 				name	=	StringField _ 'Name' ,	validators=[InputRequired  ] 	 	 class	ProductForm NameForm :	 				price	=	DecimalField _ 'Price' ,	validators=[	 								InputRequired  ,	NumberRange min=Decimal '0.0'  	 				] 	 				category	=	CategoryField 	 								_ 'Category' ,	validators=[InputRequired  ],	coerce=int	 				 	 				image	=	FileField _ 'Product	Image'  	 	 class	CategoryForm NameForm :	 				name	=	StringField _ 'Name' ,	validators=[	 								InputRequired  ,	check_duplicate_category  	 				] 	  Notice	that	all	the	field	labels	are	enclosed	within	_  	to	be	marked	for translation.  2.	 Now,	run	the	extract	and	update	pybabel	commands	to	update	the	messages.po file,	and	then	fill	in	the	relevant	translations	and	run	the	compile	command. Refer	to	the	previous	recipe,	Adding	a	new	language,	for	details.  3.	 Now,	open	the	product	creation	page	using	the	following  link:	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product-create.	Does	it	work	as	expected?	No!	As most	of	us	would	have	guessed	by	now,	the	reason	for	this	behavior	is	that this	text	is	marked	for	translation	outside	the	request	context.  To	make	this	work,	modify	the	import	statement	to	the	following:  from	flask_babel	import	lazy_gettext	as	_	  4.	 Now,	we	have	more	text	to	translate.	Let's	say	we	want	to	translate	the  product	creation	flash	message	content,	which	looks	like	this:  flash 'The	product	%s	has	been	created'	%	name 	   To	mark	it	as	translatable,	we	cannot	simply	wrap	the	whole	thing	inside _  	or	gettext  .	The	gettext  	function	supports	placeholders,	which	can	be used	as	% name s.	Using	this,	the	preceding	code	will	become	something like	this:  flash _ 'The	product	% name s	has	been	created',	name=name  	  The	resulting	translated	text	for	this	will	be	something	like	Le	produit	%  name s	a	été	créé.  5.	 There	may	be	cases	where	we	need	to	manage	the	translations	based	on	the  number	of	items,	that	is,	singular	or	plural	names.	This	is	handled	by	the ngettext  	method.	Let's	take	an	example	where	we	want	to	show	the	number of	pages	in	our	products.html	template.	For	this,	add	the	following	code:  {{	ngettext '% num d	page',	'% num d	pages',	products.pages 	}}	  Here,	the	template	will	render	page	if	there	is	only	one	page,	and	pages	if there	is	more	than	one	page.  It	is	interesting	to	note	how	this	translation	appears	in	the	messages.po	file:  :	my_app templates products.html:20	 ,	python-format	 msgid	"% num d	page"	 msgid_plural	"% num d	pages"	 msgstr[0]	"% num d	page"	 msgstr[1]	"% num d	pages"	  The	preceding	code	makes	the	concept	of	how	this	works	clear.   Implementing	the	global	language switching	action  In	the	previous	recipes,	we	saw	that	the	languages	change	on	the	basis	of	the current	language	preferences	in	the	browser.	Now,	however,	we	want	a mechanism	where	we	can	switch	the	language	being	used	irrespective	of	the language	in	the	browser.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	understand	how	to	handle	the language	at	the	application	level.   Getting	ready  We	start	by	modifying	the	application	from	the	last	recipe,	Implementing	lazy evaluation	and	the	gettext ngettext	functions,	to	accommodate	the	changes	to enable	language	switching.	We	will	add	an	extra	URL	part	to	all	our	routes	to allow	us	to	add	the	current	language.	We	can	just	change	this	language	in	the URL	in	order	to	switch	between	languages.   How	to	do	it...  Observe	the	following	steps	to	understand	how	to	implement	language	switching globally:  1.	 First,	modify	all	the	URL	rules	to	accommodate	an	extra	URL  part.	@catalog.route ' ' 	will	become	@catalog.route '   ' ,	and @catalog.route ' home' 	will	become	@catalog.route '   home' .	Similarly, @catalog.route ' product-search  ' 	will	become @catalog.route '   product-search  ' .	The	same	needs	to	be	done for	all	the	URL	rules.  2.	 Now,	add	a	function	that	will	add	the	language	passed	in	the	URL	to	the  global	proxy	object,	g:  @app.before_request	 def	before  :	 				if	request.view_args	and	'lang'	in	request.view_args:	 								g.current_lang	=	request.view_args['lang']	 								request.view_args.pop 'lang' 	  This	method	will	run	before	each	request	and	add	the	current	language	to g.  3.	 However,	this	will	mean	that	all	the	url_for  	calls	in	the	application	need	to be	modified	to	have	an	extra	parameter	called	lang	to	be	passed.	Fortunately, there	is	an	easy	way	out	of	this,	which	is	as	follows:  from	flask	import	url_for	as	flask_url_for	 	 @app.context_processor	 def	inject_url_for  :	 				return	{	 								'url_for':	lambda	endpoint,	**kwargs:	flask_url_for 	 												endpoint,	lang=g.current_lang,	**kwargs	 								 	 				}	 	 url_for	=	inject_url_for  ['url_for']	  In	the	preceding	code,	we	first	imported	url_for	from	flask	as	flask_url_for. Then,	we	updated	the	application	context	processor	to	have	the	url_for   function,	which	is	a	modified	version	of	url_for  	provided	by	Flask	in order	to	have	lang	as	an	extra	parameter.	Also,	we	used	the	same	url_for     method	that	we	used	in	our	views.   How	it	works...  Now,	run	the	application	as	it	is,	and	you	will	notice	that	all	the	URLs	will	have a	language	part.	The	following	two	screenshots	will	show	what	the	rendered templates	will	look	like.  For	English,	the	following	screenshot	shows	what	the	home	page	looks	like	after opening	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 en home:  For	French,	just	change	the	URL	to	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 fr home,	and	the	home page	will	look	like	this:   See	also  The	recipe	entitled	Adding	a	new	language	to	handle	localization	based	on	the language	set	in	the	browser	 which	is,	by	default,	picked	up	from	the	language set	at	the	OS	level .   Debugging,	Error	Handling,	and Testing  Until	now,	in	this	book,	we	have	concentrated	on	developing	applications	and adding	features	to	them	one	at	a	time.	It	is	very	important	to	know	how	robust our	application	is	and	to	keep	track	of	how	the	application	has	been	working	and performing.	This,	in	turn,	gives	rise	to	the	need	to	be	informed	when	something goes	wrong	in	the	application.	It	is	normal	to	miss	out	on	certain	edge	cases while	developing	the	application,	and	usually,	even	the	test	cases	miss	them	out. It	would	be	great	to	know	about	these	edge	cases	whenever	they	occur	so	that they	can	be	handled	accordingly.  Effective	logging	and	the	ability	to	debug	quickly	are	a	couple	of	the	deciding factors	when	choosing	a	framework	for	application	development.	The	better	the logging	and	debugging	support	from	the	framework,	the	quicker	the	process	of application	development	and	maintenance	is.	A	better	level	of	logging	and debugging	support	helps	developers	quickly	find	out	the	issues	in	the application,	and,	on	many	occasions,	logging	points	out	issues	even	before	they are	identified	by	end	users.	Effective	error	handling	plays	an	important	role	in end	user	satisfaction	and	eases	the	pain	of	debugging	at	the	developer's	end. Even	if	the	code	is	perfect,	the	application	is	bound	to	throw	errors	at	times. Why?	The	answer	is	simple:	the	code	might	be	perfect,	but	the	world	in	which	it works	is	not.	There	can	be	innumerable	issues	that	can	occur	and,	as	developers, we	always	want	to	know	the	reason	behind	any	anomaly.	Writing	test	cases along	with	the	application	is	one	of	the	most	important	pillars	of	software writing.  Python's	built-in	logging	system	works	pretty	well	with	Flask.	We	will	work with	this	logging	system	in	this	chapter	before	moving	on	to	an	awesome	service called	Sentry,	which	eases	the	pain	of	debugging	and	error	logging	to	a	huge extent.  As	we	have	already	talked	about	the	importance	of	testing	for	application development,	we	will	now	see	how	to	write	test	cases	for	a	Flask	application. We	will	also	see	how	we	can	measure	code	coverage	and	profile	our	application   We	will	also	see	how	we	can	measure	code	coverage	and	profile	our	application to	tackle	any	bottlenecks.  Testing	in	itself	is	a	huge	topic	and	has	several	books	attributed	to	it.	Here,	we will	try	to	understand	the	basics	of	testing	with	Flask.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Setting	up	basic	file	logging Sending	emails	on	the	occurrence	of	errors Using	Sentry	to	monitor	exceptions Debugging	with	pdb Creating	our	first	simple	test Writing	more	tests	for	views	and	logic Nose	library	integration Using	mocking	to	avoid	real	API	access Determining	test	coverage Using	profiling	to	find	bottlenecks   Setting	up	basic	file	logging  By	default,	Flask	will	not	log	anything	for	us	anywhere,	except	for	the	errors with	their	stack	traces,	which	are	sent	to	the	logger	 we	will	see	more	of	this	in the	rest	of	the	chapter .	It	does	create	a	lot	of	stack	traces	while	we	run	the application	in	the	development	mode	using	run.py,	but,	in	production	systems,	we don't	have	this	luxury.	Thankfully,	the	logging	library	provides	a	whole	lot	of log	handlers,	which	can	be	used	as	per	requirements.	In	this	recipe,	we	will understand	how	the	logging	library	can	be	leveraged	to	ensure	that	effective	logs are	being	captured	from	Flask	applications.   Getting	ready  We	will	start	with	our	catalog	application	from	previous	chapter	and	add	some basic	logging	to	the	same	using	FileHandler,	which	logs	messages	to	a	specified file	on	the	filesystem.	We	will	start	with	a	basic	log	format	and	then	see	how	to format	the	log	messages	to	be	more	informative.   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	configure	and	set	up	a	logging	library	to	use	with	our application:  1.	 The	first	change	is	made	to	the	my_app __init__.py	file,	which	serves	as	the  application's	configuration	file:  app.config['LOG_FILE']	=	'application.log'	 	 if	not	app.debug:	 				import	logging	 				logging.basicConfig level=logging.INFO  				from	logging	import	FileHandler	 				file_handler	=	FileHandler app.config['LOG_FILE'] 	 				app.logger.addHandler file_handler 	  Here,	we	added	a	configuration	parameter	to	specify	the	log	file's location.	This	takes	the	relative	path	from	the	application	folder,	unless an	absolute	path	is	explicitly	specified.	Next,	we	will	check	whether	the application	is	already	in	debug	mode,	and	then	we	will	add	a	handler logging	to	a	file	with	the	logging	level	as	INFO.	Now,	DEBUG	is	the	lowest logging	level	and	will	log	everything	at	any	level.	For	more	details,	refer to	the	logging	library	documentation	 refer	to	the	See	also	section .  2.	 After	this,	add	loggers	to	the	application	wherever	they	are	needed,	and	the application	will	start	logging	to	the	deputed	file.	Now,	let's	add	a	couple	of loggers	for	demonstration	to	my_app catalog views.py:  @catalog.route ' ' 	 @catalog.route '   ' 	 @catalog.route '   home' 	 @template_or_json 'home.html' 	 def	home  :	 				products	=	Product.query.all  	 				app.logger.info 	 								'Home	page	with	total	of	%d	products'	%	len products 	 				 	 				return	{'count':	len products }	 	 	 @catalog.route '   product  ' 	 def	product id :	 				product	=	Product.query.filter_by id=id .first  	 				if	not	product:	 								app.logger.warning 'Requested	product	not	found.' 	 								abort 404 	 				return	render_template 'product.html',	product=product 	   				return	render_template 'product.html',	product=product 	  In	the	preceding	code,	we	have	loggers	for	a	couple	of	our	view	handlers. Notice	that	the	first	of	the	loggers	in	home  	is	of	the	info	level,	and	the other	in	product  	is	warning.	If	we	set	our	log	level	in	__init__.py	as	INFO, then	both	will	be	logged,	and	if	we	set	the	level	as	WARNING,	then	only	the warning	logger	will	be	logged.  Make	sure	to	import	abort	from	Flask	if	this	has	not	already	been	done: from	flask	import	abort   How	it	works...  The	preceding	steps	will	create	a	file	called	application.log	at	the	root	application folder.	The	logger	statements	as	specified	will	be	logged	to	application.log	and will	look	something	like	the	following	snippet,	depending	on	the	handler	called; the	first	one	being	from	home,	and	the	second	from	requesting	a	product,	which does	not	exist:  2019-04-16	14:30:49,133	INFO:	Home	page	with	total	of	1	products	[in	 Users shalabh.aggarwal workspace cookbook10 Chapter-10 my_app catalog views.py:74] 2019-04-16	14:30:54,390	WARNING:	Requested	product	not	found.	[in	 Users shalabh.aggarwal workspace cookbook10 Chapter-10 my_app catalog views.py:83]	   There's	more...  The	information	logged	does	not	help	much.	It	will	be	great	to	know	when	the issue	was	logged,	with	what	level,	which	file	caused	the	issue	at	what	line number,	and	so	on.	This	can	be	achieved	using	advanced	logging	formats.	For this,	we	need	to	add	a	couple	of	statements	to	the	configuration	file;	that	is, my_app __init__.py:  if	not	app.debug:	 				import	logging	 				logging.basicConfig level=logging.WARNING  				from	logging	import	FileHandler,	Formatter	 				file_handler	=	FileHandler app.config['LOG_FILE'] 	 				app.logger.addHandler file_handler 	 				file_handler.setFormatter Formatter 	 								'% asctime s	% levelname s:	% message s	'	 								'[in	% pathname s:% lineno d]'	 				  	  In	the	preceding	code,	we	added	a	formatter	to	file_handler,	which	will	log	the time,	log	level,	message,	file	path,	and	line	number.	After	this,	the	logged message	will	look	like	this:  2014-08-02	15:18:21,154	WARNING:	Requested	product	not	found.	[in	 Users shalabhaggarwal workspace mydev flask_catalog_testing_lgging my_app catalog views.py:50]   See	also  Go	to	Python's	logging	library	documentation	about	handlers	at	https:  docs.python .org dev library logging.handlers.html	to	learn	more	about	logging	handlers.   Sending	emails	on	the	occurrence	of errors  It	is	a	good	idea	to	receive	notifications	when	something	unexpected	happens with	the	application.	Setting	this	up	is	pretty	easy	and	adds	a	lot	of	convenience to	the	process	of	error	handling.   Getting	ready  We	will	take	the	application	from	the	last	recipe	and	add	mail_handler	to	it	to	make our	application	send	emails	when	an	error	occurs.	Also,	we	will	demonstrate	the email	setup	using	Gmail	as	the	SMTP	server.   How	to	do	it...  First,	add	the	handler	to	the	configuration	in	my_app __init__.py.	This	is	similar	to how	we	added	file_handler	in	the	previous	recipe:  RECEPIENTS	=	['some_receiver@gmail.com']	 	 if	not	app.debug:	 				import	logging	 				logging.basicConfig level=logging.INFO  				from	logging	import	FileHandler,	Formatter	 				from	logging.handlers	import	SMTPHandler	 				file_handler	=	FileHandler app.config['LOG_FILE'] 	 				app.logger.addHandler file_handler 	 				mail_handler	=	SMTPHandler 	 								 "smtp.gmail.com",	587 ,	'sender@gmail.com',	RECEPIENTS,	 								'Error	occurred	in	your	application',	 								 'sender@gmail.com',	'some_gmail_password' ,	secure=   	 				mail_handler.setLevel logging.ERROR 	 				app.logger.addHandler mail_handler 	 				for	handler	in	[file_handler,	mail_handler]:	 								handler.setFormatter Formatter 	 												'% asctime s	% levelname s:	% message s	'	 												'[in	% pathname s:% lineno d]'	 								  	  Here,	we	have	a	list	of	email	addresses	to	which	the	error	notification	email	will be	sent.	Also	note	that	we	have	set	the	log	level	to	ERROR	in	the	case	of	mail_handler. This	is	because	emails	will	be	necessary	only	in	the	case	of	crucial	matters.  For	more	details	on	the	configuration	of	SMTPHandler,	refer	to	the	documentation.  Always	make	sure	that	you	turn	the	debug	flag	off	in	run.py	to	enable	the	application	to	log and	send	emails	for	internal	application	errors	 error	500 .   How	it	works...  To	cause	an	internal	application	error,	just	misspell	some	keyword	in	any	of	your handlers.	You	will	receive	an	email	in	your	mailbox,	with	the	formatting	as	set in	the	configuration	and	a	complete	stack	trace	for	your	reference.   There's	more...  We	might	also	want	to	log	all	the	errors	when	a	page	is	not	found	 error	404 .	For this,	we	can	just	tweak	the	errorhandler	method	a	bit:  @app.errorhandler 404 	 def	page_not_found e :	 				app.logger.error e 	 				return	render_template '404.html' ,	404	   Using	Sentry	to	monitor	exceptions  Sentry	is	a	tool	that	eases	the	process	of	monitoring	exceptions	and	also	provides insights	into	the	errors	that	the	users	of	the	application	face	while	using	it.	It	is highly	possible	that	there	are	errors	in	log	files	that	get	overlooked	by	the	human eye.	Sentry	categorizes	the	errors	under	different	categories	and	keeps	a	count	of the	recurrence	of	errors.	This	helps	in	understanding	the	severity	of	the	errors	on multiple	criteria	and	handling	them	accordingly.	It	has	a	nice	GUI	that	facilitates all	of	these	features.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	set	up	Sentry	and	use	it	as	an effective	error	monitoring	tool.   Getting	ready  Sentry	is	available	as	a	cloud	service,	which	is	available	free	for	developers	and basic	usage.	For	the	purposes	of	this	recipe,	this	freely	available	cloud	service will	be	enough.	Head	over	to	https:  sentry.io signup 	and	get	started	with	the registration	process.	This	being	said,	we	need	to	install	the	Python	SDK	for Sentry:  				$	pip3	install	'sentry-sdk[flask]==0.7.10'   How	to	do	it...  Once	the	Sentry	registration	is	complete,	a	screen	will	be	shown	that	will	ask about	the	type	of	project	that	needs	to	be	integrated	with	Sentry.	See	the following	screenshot:  This	would	be	followed	by	another	screen	that	will	show	the	steps	on	how	to configure	your	Flask	application	to	send	events	to	the	newly	created	and configured	Sentry	instance.	This	is	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:   Sentry	can	also	be	downloaded	for	free	and	installed	as	an	on-premises	application.	There are	multiple	ways	of	installing	and	configuring	Sentry	as	per	your	needs.	You	are	free	to	try this	approach	on	your	own	as	it	goes	beyond	the	scope	of	this	recipe.  After	the	previous	setup	is	complete,	add	the	following	code	to	your	Flask application	in	my_app __init__.py:  import	sentry_sdk from	sentry_sdk.integrations.flask	import	FlaskIntegration  sentry_sdk.init  				dsn=" ", 				integrations=[FlaskIntegration  ]    You	can	add	the	init	statement	shown	previously	before	or	after	the	Flask	app object	is	created.   How	it	works...  An	error	logged	in	Sentry	will	look	like	the	following	screenshot:  It	is	also	possible	to	log	messages	and	user-defined	exceptions	in	Sentry.	I	will leave	this	to	you	to	figure	out	by	yourself.   Debugging	with	pdb  Most	of	the	Python	developers	reading	this	book	might	already	be	aware	of	the usage	of	python	debugger	 pdb .	For	those	who	are	not	aware	of	it,	pdb	is	an interactive	source	code	debugger	for	Python	programs.	We	can	set	breakpoints wherever	needed,	debug	using	single	stepping	at	the	source	line	level,	and inspect	the	stack	frames.  Many	new	developers	might	be	of	the	opinion	that	the	job	of	a	debugger	can	be handled	using	a	logger,	but	debuggers	provide	a	much	deeper	insight	into	the flow	of	control,	preserve	the	state	at	each	step,	and	hence	potentially	save	a	lot of	development	time.	In	this	recipe,	let's	have	a	look	at	what	pdb	brings	to	the table.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	Python's	built-in	pdb	module	for	this	recipe	and	use	it	in	our application	from	the	last	recipe.   How	to	do	it...  Using	pdb	is	pretty	simple	in	most	cases.	We	just	need	to	insert	the	following statement	wherever	we	want	to	insert	a	breakpoint	to	inspect	a	certain	block	of code:  import	pdb;	pdb.set_trace  	  This	will	trigger	the	application	to	break	execution	at	this	point,	and	then,	we	can step	through	the	stack	frames	one	by	one	using	the	debugger	commands.  So,	let's	insert	this	statement	in	one	of	our	methods,	say,	the	handler	for products:  def	products page=1 :	 				products	=	Product.query.paginate page,	10 	 				import	pdb;	pdb.set_trace  	 				return	render_template 'products.html',	products=products 	   How	it	works...  Whenever	the	control	comes	to	this	line,	the	debugger	prompt	will	fire	up;	this will	appear	as	follows:  	->	return	render_template 'products.html',	products=product  				 Pdb 	u 				>	 Users shalabhaggarwal workspace flask_heroku lib python2.7 site-packages Flask-0.10.1-py2.7.egg flask app.py 1461 dispatch_request   				->	return	self.view_functions[rule.endpoint] **req.view_args  				 Pdb 	u 				>	 Users shalabhaggarwal workspace flask_heroku lib python2.7 site-packages Flask-0.10.1-py2.7.egg flask app.py 1475 full_dispatch_request   				->	rv	=	self.dispatch_request   				 Pdb 	u 				>	 Users shalabhaggarwal workspace flask_heroku lib python2.7 site-packages Flask-0.10.1-py2.7.egg flask app.py 1817 wsgi_app   				->	response	=	self.full_dispatch_request   		  Notice	u	written	against	 Pdb .	This	signifies	that	I	am	moving	the	current	frame one	level	up	in	the	stack	trace.	All	the	variables,	parameters,	and	properties	used in	that	statement	will	be	available	in	the	same	context	to	help	figure	out	the	issue or	just	understand	the	flow	of	code.   See	also  Go	to	the	pdb	module	documentation	at	https:  docs.python.org 3 library pdb.htmldeb ugger-commands	to	get	hold	of	the	various	debugger	commands.   Creating	our	first	simple	test  Testing	is	one	of	the	strong	pillars	of	any	software	during	development	and, later,	during	maintenance	and	expansion,	too.	Especially	in	the	case	of	web applications	where	the	application	will	handle	high	traffic	and	be	scrutinized	by a	large	number	of	end	users	at	all	times,	testing	becomes	pretty	important,	as	the user	feedback	determines	the	fate	of	the	application.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	see how	to	start	with	test	writing	and	also	see	more	complex	tests	in	the	recipes	to follow.   Getting	ready  We	will	start	with	the	creation	of	a	new	test	file	named	app_tests.py	at	the	root application	level,	that	is,	alongside	the	my_app	folder.   How	to	do	it...  Let's	write	our	first	test	case:  import	os	 from	my_app	import	app,	db	 import	unittest	 import	tempfile	  1.	 To	start	with,	the	content	of	the	app_tests.py	test	file	will	be	as	follows:  The	preceding	code	describes	the	imports	needed	for	this	test	suite.	We will	use	unittest	for	writing	our	tests.	A	tempfile	instance	is	needed	to create	SQLite	databases	on	the	fly.  2.	 All	the	test	cases	need	to	subclass	from	unitest.TestCase:  class	CatalogTestCase unittest.TestCase :	 	 				def	setUp self :	 								self.test_db_file	=	tempfile.mkstemp  [1]	 								app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']	=	'sqlite:   '	+	 											self.test_db_file	 								app.config['TESTING']	=	True	 								self.app	=	app.test_client  	 								db.create_all  	  The	preceding	method	is	run	before	each	test	is	run	and	creates	a	new	test client.	A	test	is	represented	by	the	methods	in	this	class	that	start	with	the test_	prefix.	Here,	we	set	a	database	name	in	the	app	configuration,	which is	a	timestamp	that	will	always	be	unique.	We	also	set	the	TESTING	flag	to True,	which	disables	error	catching	to	enable	better	testing.	Finally,	we run	the	create_all  	method	on	db	to	create	all	the	tables	from	our application	in	the	test	database	created.  3.	 Remove	the	temporary	database	created	in	the	previous	step	after	the	test  has	executed:  				def	tearDown self :	 								os.remove self.test_db_file 	  The	preceding	method	is	called	after	each	test	is	run.	Here,	we	will remove	the	current	database	file	and	use	a	fresh	database	file	for	each test.   test.  4.	 Finally,	write	the	test	case:  				def	test_home self :	 								rv	=	self.app.get ' ' 	 								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200 	  The	preceding	code	is	our	first	test,	where	we	sent	an	HTTP	GET	request to	our	application	at	the	 	URL	and	tested	the	response	for	the	status code,	which	should	be	200.	This	represents	a	successful	GET	response:  if	__name__	==	'__main__':	 				unittest.main  	   How	it	works...  To	run	the	test	file,	just	execute	the	following	command	in	the	terminal:  				$	python	app_tests.py	  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	output	that	signifies	the	outcome	of	the tests:   See	also  Refer	to	the	next	recipe,	Writing	more	tests	for	views	and	logic,	to	see	more	on how	to	write	complex	tests.   Writing	more	tests	for	views	and	logic  In	the	last	recipe,	we	got	started	with	writing	tests	for	our	Flask	application.	In this	recipe,	we	will	build	upon	the	same	test	file	and	add	more	tests	for	our application;	these	tests	will	cover	testing	the	views	for	behavior	and	logic.   Getting	ready  We	will	build	upon	the	test	file	named	app_tests.py	created	in	the	last	recipe.   How	to	do	it...  Before	we	write	any	tests,	we	need	to	add	a	small	bit	of	configuration	to	setUp   to	disable	the	CSRF	tokens,	as	they	are	not	generated	by	default	for	test environments:  app.config['WTF_CSRF_ENABLED']	=	False	  The	following	are	some	tests	that	are	created	as	a	part	of	this	recipe.	Each	test will	be	described	as	we	go	further.  1.	 Write	a	test	to	make	a	GET	request	to	the	products	list:  				def	test_products self : 								"Test	Products	list	page" 								rv	=	self.app.get ' en products'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertTrue 'No	Previous	Page'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"   								self.assertTrue 'No	Next	Page'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"    The	preceding	test	sends	a	GET	request	to	 products	and	asserts	that	the status	code	of	the	response	is	200.	It	also	asserts	that	there	is	no	previous page	and	no	next	page	 rendered	as	a	part	of	template	logic .  2.	 Next,	create	a	category	and	verify	that	it	has	been	created	correctly:  				def	test_create_category self : 								"Test	creation	of	new	category" 								rv	=	self.app.get ' en category-create'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200   								rv	=	self.app.post ' en category-create'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertTrue 'This	field	is	required.'	in	 								rv.data.decode "utf-8"    								rv	=	self.app.get ' en categories'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertFalse 'Phones'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"    								rv	=	self.app.post ' en category-create',	data={ 												'name':	'Phones', 								}  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	302   								rv	=	self.app.get ' en categories'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertTrue 'Phones'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"    								rv	=	self.app.get ' en category 1'    								rv	=	self.app.get ' en category 1'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertTrue 'Phones'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"    The	preceding	test	creates	a	category	and	asserts	for	corresponding	status messages.	When	a	category	is	successfully	created,	we	will	redirect	to the	newly	created	category	page,	and	hence,	the	status	code	will	be	302.  3.	 Similar	to	category	creation,	now	create	a	product	and	then	verify	its  creation:  				def	test_create_product self : 								"Test	creation	of	new	product" 								rv	=	self.app.get ' en product-create'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200   								rv	=	self.app.post ' en product-create'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertTrue 'This	field	is	required.'	in	 								rv.data.decode "utf-8"    									Create	a	category	to	be	used	in	product	creation 								rv	=	self.app.post ' en category-create',	data={ 												'name':	'Phones', 								}  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	302   								rv	=	self.app.post ' en product-create',	data={ 												'name':	'iPhone	5', 												'price':	549.49, 												'company':	'Apple', 												'category':	1, 												'image':	tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile   								}  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	302   								rv	=	self.app.get ' en products'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertTrue 'iPhone	5'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"  	  The	preceding	test	creates	a	product	and	asserts	for	corresponding	status messages	on	each	call.  As	a	part	of	this	test,	we	identified	a	small	improvement	in	our	create_product  	method.	What looked	like	image	=	request.files['image']	earlier	was	now	replaced	by	image	=	request.files	and request.files['image'].	This	is	because,	in	the	case	of	an	HTML	form,	we	had	an	empty request.files['image']	parameter,	but	in	this	case,	we	don't.  4.	 Finally,	create	multiple	products	and	search	for	the	products	that	were	just  created:  				def	test_search_product self : 								"Test	searching	product" 									Create	a	category	to	be	used	in	product	creation 								rv	=	self.app.post ' en category-create',	data={   								rv	=	self.app.post ' en category-create',	data={ 												'name':	'Phones', 								}  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	302   									Create	a	product 								rv	=	self.app.post ' en product-create',	data={ 												'name':	'iPhone	5', 												'price':	549.49, 												'company':	'Apple', 												'category':	1, 												'image':	tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile   								}  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	302   									Create	another	product 								rv	=	self.app.post ' en product-create',	data={ 												'name':	'Galaxy	S5', 												'price':	549.49, 												'company':	'Samsung', 												'category':	1, 												'image':	tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile   								}  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	302   								self.app.get ' '   								rv	=	self.app.get ' en product-search?name=iPhone'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertTrue 'iPhone	5'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"   								self.assertFalse 'Galaxy	S5'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"    								rv	=	self.app.get ' en product-search?name=iPhone	6'  								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200  								self.assertFalse 'iPhone	6'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"  	  The	preceding	test	first	creates	a	category	and	two	products.	Then,	it searches	for	one	product	and	makes	sure	that	only	the	searched	product	is returned	in	the	result.   How	it	works...  To	run	the	test	file,	just	execute	the	following	command	in	the	terminal:  				$	python	app_tests.py	-v 				test_create_category	 __main__.CatalogTestCase  				Test	creation	of	new	category	...	ok 				test_create_product	 __main__.CatalogTestCase  				Test	creation	of	new	product	...	ok 				test_home	 __main__.CatalogTestCase  				Test	home	page	...	ok 				test_products	 __main__.CatalogTestCase  				Test	Products	list	page	...	ok 				test_search_product	 __main__.CatalogTestCase  				Test	searching	product	...	ok 				--------------------------------------------------------------------- 				Ran	5	tests	in	0.189s 				 				OK 		  What	follows	the	command	is	the	output	that	signifies	the	outcome	of	the	tests.   Nose	library	integration  Nose	is	a	library	that	makes	testing	easier	and	much	more	fun.	It	provides	a whole	lot	of	tools	to	enhance	our	tests.	Although	nose	can	be	used	for	multiple purposes,	the	most	important	usage	remains	that	of	a	test	collector	and	runner. nose	automatically	collects	tests	from	Python	source	files,	directories,	and packages	found	in	the	current	working	directory.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	focus	on how	to	run	individual	tests	using	nose	rather	than	the	whole	bunch	of	tests	every time.   Getting	ready  First,	we	need	to	install	the	nose	library:  				$	pip3	install	nose	   How	to	do	it...  We	can	execute	all	the	tests	in	our	application	using	nose	by	running	the following	command:  				$	nosetests	-v 				Test	creation	of	new	category	...	ok 				Test	creation	of	new	product	...	ok 				Test	home	page	...	ok 				Test	Products	list	page	...	ok 				Test	searching	product	...	ok 				---------------------------------------------------------------- 				---- 				Ran	5	tests	in	0.399s 				 				OK		  This	will	pick	out	all	the	tests	in	our	application	and	run	them	even	if	we	have multiple	test	files.  To	run	a	single	test	file,	simply	run	the	following	command:  				$	nosetests	app_tests.py	  Now,	if	you	want	to	run	a	single	test,	simply	run	this	command:  				$	nosetests	app_tests:CatalogTestCase.test_home	  This	becomes	important	when	we	have	a	memory-intensive	application	and	a large	number	of	test	cases.	Then,	the	tests	themselves	can	take	a	lot	of	time	to run,	and	doing	so	every	time	can	be	very	frustrating	for	a	developer.	Instead,	we will	prefer	to	run	only	those	tests	that	concern	the	change	made	or	the	test	that broke	following	a	certain	change.   See	also  There	are	many	other	ways	of	configuring	nose	for	optimal	and	effective	usage	as per	requirements.	Refer	to	the	nose	documentation	at	http:  nose.readthedocs.org en  latest usage.html	for	more	details.   Using	mocking	to	avoid	real	API access  We	are	aware	of	how	testing	works,	but	now	let's	say	we	have	a	third-party application service	integrated	via	API	calls	with	our	application.	It	would	not	be a	great	idea	to	make	calls	to	this	application service	every	time	tests	are	run. Sometimes,	these	can	be	paid,	too,	and	making	calls	during	tests	cannot	only	be expensive,	but	also	affect	the	statistics	of	that	service.	Mocking	plays	a	very important	role	in	such	scenarios.	The	simplest	example	of	this	can	be	mocking SMTP	for	emails.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	integrate	our	application	with	the	geoip library	and	then	test	it	via	mocking.   Getting	ready  In	Python	3,	mock	has	been	included	as	a	standard	package	in	the	unittest	library.  For	the	purpose	of	this	recipe,	first,	we	need	to	install	the	geoip2	library	and	the corresponding	database:  $	pip3	install	geoip2  You	also	need	to	download	the	free	geoip	database	from	the	MaxMind	website	to a	location	of	your	preference	and	then	unzip	the	file.	For	the	sake	of	simplicity,	I have	downloaded	it	to	the	project	folder	itself:  $	wget	https:  geolite.maxmind.com download geoip database GeoLite2-City.tar.gz $	tar	-xvzf	GeoLite2-City.tar.gz  After	completing	the	preceding	steps,	you	should	have	a	folder	with	the	prefix Geolite2-City-.	This	folder	contains	the	geoip	database	with	the	.mmdb	extension	that we	will	use	ahead	in	this	recipe.  Now,	let's	say	we	want	to	store	the	location	of	the	user	who	creates	a	product  think	of	a	scenario	where	the	application	is	administered	at	multiple	locations around	the	globe .  We	need	to	make	some	small	changes	to	my_app catalog models.py, my_app catalog views.py,	and	templates product.html.  For	my_app catalog models.py,	we	will	add	a	new	field	named	user_timezone:  class	Product db.Model :	 					..	Other	fields	..	 				user_timezone	=	db.Column db.String 255  	 	 				def	__init__ self,	name,	price,	category=None,	image_path='',	 												user_timezone='' :	 								..	Other	fields	initialization	..	 								self.user_timezone	=	user_timezone	  For	my_app catalog views.py,	we	will	modify	the	create_product  	method	to	include the	time	zone:  import	geoip2.database	 	   	 def	create_product  :	 				form	=	ProductForm request.form 	 	 				if	request.method	==	'POST'	and	form.validate  :	 									..	Non	changed	code	..	 								reader	=	geoip2.database.Reader 'GeoLite2-City_20190416 GeoLite2-City.mmdb'  								match	=	reader.city request.remote_addr 	 								product	=	Product 	 												name,	price,	company,	existing_category,	filename,	 												match	and	match.location.time_zone	or	'Localhost'	 								 	 									..	Non	changed	code	..	  Here,	we	fetched	the	geolocation	data	using	an	IP	lookup	and	passed	this	during product	creation.	If	no	match	is	found,	then	the	call	is	made	from	the	localhost, or	from	127.0.0.1	or	0.0.0.0.  Also,	we	will	add	this	new	field	in	our	product	template	so	that	it	becomes	easy to	verify	in	the	test.	For	this,	just	add	{{	product.user_timezone	}}	somewhere	in	the product.html	template.   How	to	do	it...  Modify	app_tests.py	to	accommodate	mocking	of	the	geoip	lookup:  1.	 First,	configure	the	mocking	of	the	geoip	lookup	by	creating	patchers:  from	unittest	import	mock import	geoip2.records	 	 class	CatalogTestCase unittest.TestCase :	 	 				def	setUp self :	 									..	Non	changed	code	..	 								self.geoip_city_patcher	=	mock.patch 'geoip2.models.City', 												location=geoip2.records.Location time_zone	=	 												'America Los_Angeles'  								  								PatchedGeoipCity	=	self.geoip_city_patcher.start   								self.geoip_reader_patcher	=	 								mock.patch 'geoip2.database.Reader'  								PatchedGeoipReader	=	self.geoip_reader_patcher.start   								PatchedGeoipReader  .city.return_value	=	PatchedGeoipCity	 								db.create_all  	  First,	we	imported	records	from	geoip2,	which	we	will	use	to	create	the mocked	return	value	that	we	need	to	use	for	testing.	Then,	we	patched geoip2.models.City	with	the	location	attribute	on	the	City	model	preset	to geoip2.records.Location time_zone	=	'America Los_Angeles' 	and	started	the patcher.	This	means	that	whenever	an	instance	of	geoip2.models.City	is created,	it	will	be	patched	with	timezone	on	the	location	attribute	as 'America Los_Angeles'.  This	is	followed	by	patching	of	geoip2.database.Reader,	where	we	mock	the return	value	of	its	city	method	to	the	PatchedGeoipCity	class	that	we	created previously.  2.	 Stop	the	patchers	that	were	started	in	the	setUp	method:  				def	tearDown self :	 								self.geoip_city_patcher.stop   								self.geoip_reader_patcher.stop   								os.remove self.test_db_file 	  We	stopped	the	mock	patchers	in	tearDown	so	that	the	actual	calls	are	not affected.   3.	 Finally,	modify	the	product	test	case	created	to	assert	the	location:  				def	test_create_product self :	 								"Test	creation	of	new	product"	 									..	Non	changed	code	..	 	 								rv	=	self.app.post ' en product-create',	data={	 												'name':	'iPhone	5',	 												'price':	549.49,	 												'company':	'Apple',	 												'category':	1	 								} 	 								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	302 	 	 								rv	=	self.app.get ' en product 1' 	 								self.assertEqual rv.status_code,	200 	 								self.assertTrue 'iPhone	5'	in	rv.data.decode "utf-8"  	 								self.assertTrue 'America Los_Angeles'	in	 								rv.data.decode "utf-8"  	  Here,	after	the	creation	of	the	product,	we	asserted	that	the America Los_Angeles	value	is	present	somewhere	in	the	product	template	that is	rendered.   How	it	works...  Run	the	test	and	see	whether	it	passes:  				$	nosetests	app_tests:CatalogTestCase.test_create_product	-v 				Test	creation	of	new	product	...	ok 				 				----------------------------------------------------- 				Ran	1	test	in	0.095s 				 				OK	   See	also  There	are	multiple	ways	in	which	mocking	can	be	done.	I	demonstrated	just	one of	them.	You	can	choose	any	method	from	the	ones	available.	Refer	to	the documentation	available	at:	https:  docs.python.org 3 library unittest.mock.html.   Determining	test	coverage  In	the	previous	recipes,	test	case	writing	was	covered,	but	there	is	an	important aspect	to	testing	called	coverage.	Coverage	refers	to	how	much	of	our	code	has been	covered	by	the	tests.	The	higher	the	percentage	of	coverage,	the	better	the test	 although	high	coverage	is	not	the	only	criterion	for	good	tests .	In	this recipe,	we	will	check	the	code	coverage	of	our	application.  Remember	that	100%	test	coverage	does	not	mean	that	the	code	is	flawless.	However,	in	any case,	it	is	better	than	having	no	tests	or	lower	coverage.	Anything	that	is	not	tested	is	broken.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	a	library	called	coverage	for	this	recipe.	The	following	is	the installation	command:  				$	pip3	install	coverage	   How	to	do	it...  The	simplest	way	of	getting	the	coverage	is	to	use	the	command	line:  1.	 Simply	run	the	following	command:  $	coverage	run	--source=..  	--omit=app_tests.py,run.py	app_tests.py  Here,	--source	indicates	the	directories	that	are	to	be	considered	in coverage,	and	--omit	indicates	the	files	that	need	to	be	omitted	in	the process.  2.	 Now,	to	print	the	report	on	the	terminal	itself,	run	the	following	command:  				$	coverage	report	  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	output:  3.	 To	get	a	nice	HTML	output	of	the	coverage	report,	run	the	following  command:  				$	coverage	html	  This	will	create	a	new	folder	named	htmlcov	in	your	current	working directory.	Inside	this,	just	open	up	index.html	in	a	browser,	and	the	full detailed	view	will	be	available.  Alternatively,	we	can	include	a	piece	of	code	in	our	test	file	and	get	the	coverage   report	every	time	the	tests	are	run.	Add	the	following	code	snippets to	app_tests.py:  1.	 Before	anything	else,	add	the	following	code	to	start	the	coverage  assessment	process:  import	coverage	 	 cov	=	coverage.coverage 	 				omit	=	[	 								' Users shalabhaggarwal workspace mydev lib python3.6 site-packages *',	 								'app_tests.py'	 				]	  	 cov.start  	  Here,	we	imported	the	coverage	library	and	created	an	object	of	it.	This tells	the	library	to	omit	all	site-packages	 by	default,	the	coverage	report	is calculated	for	all	dependencies	as	well 	and	the	test	file	itself.	Then,	we started	the	process	to	determine	the	coverage.  2.	 At	the	end	of	the	code,	modify	the	last	block	to	the	following:  if	__name__	==	'__main__':	 				try:	 								unittest.main  	 				finally:	 								cov.stop  	 								cov.save  	 								cov.report  	 								cov.html_report directory	=	'coverage' 	 								cov.erase  	  In	the	preceding	code,	we	first	put	unittest.main  	inside	a	try..finally block.	This	is	because	unittest.main  	exits	after	all	the	tests	are	executed. Now,	the	coverage-specific	code	is	forced	to	run	after	this	method completes.	We	first	stopped	the	coverage	report,	saved	it,	printed	the report	on	the	console,	and	then	generated	the	HTML	version	of	it	before deleting	the	temporary	.coverage	file	 this	is	created	automatically	as	part of	the	process .   How	it	works...  If	we	run	our	tests	after	including	the	coverage-specific	code,	then	we	can	run the	following	command:  				$	python	app_tests.py	  The	output	will	be	as	shown	in	the	following	screenshot:   See	also  It	is	also	possible	to	determine	coverage	using	the	nose	library	that	we	discussed in	the	Nose	library	integration	recipe.	I	will	leave	it	to	you	to	explore	this	by yourself.	Refer	to	https:  nose.readthedocs.org en latest plugins cover.html?highlight=co verage	for	a	head	start.   Using	profiling	to	find	bottlenecks  Profiling	is	an	important	tool	for	when	we	decide	to	scale	the	application.	Before scaling,	we	want	to	know	whether	any	process	is	a	bottleneck	and	affects	the overall	performance.	Python	has	a	built-in	profiler,	cProfile,	that	can	do	the	job for	us,	but	to	make	life	easier,	werkzeug	has	ProfilerMiddleware,	which	is	written	over cProfile.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	use	ProfilerMiddleware	to	determine	whether	there	is anything	that	affects	the	performance.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	the	application	from	the	previous	recipe	and	add	ProfilerMiddleware	to a	new	file	named	generate_profile.py.   How	to	do	it...  Create	a	new	file,	generate_profile.py,	alongside	run.py,	which	works	like	run.py itself,	but	with	ProfilerMiddleware:  from	werkzeug.middleware.profiler	import	ProfilerMiddleware	 from	my_app	import	app	 	 app.wsgi_app	=	ProfilerMiddleware app.wsgi_app,	restrictions	=	[10] 	 app.run debug=True 	  Here,	we	imported	ProfilerMiddleware	from	werkzeug	and	then	modified	wsgi_app	on our	Flask	app	to	use	it,	with	a	restriction	of	the	top	10	calls	to	be	printed	in	the output.   How	it	works...  Now,	we	can	run	our	application	using	generate_profile.py:  $	python	generate_profile.py	  We	can	then	create	a	new	product.	Then,	the	output	for	that	specific	call	will	be like	the	following	screenshot:  It	is	evident	from	the	preceding	screenshot	that	the	most	intensive	call	in	this process	is	the	call	made	to	the	geoip	database.	Even	though	it	is	a	single	call,	it takes	the	most	amount	of	time.	So,	if	we	decide	to	improve	the	performance sometime	down	the	line,	then	this	is	something	that	needs	to	be	looked	at	first.   Deployment	and	Post-Deployment  Until	now,	we	have	learned	how	to	write	Flask	applications	in	different	ways. The	deployment	of	an	application	and	managing	the	application	post- deployment	is	as	important	as	developing	it.	There	can	be	various	ways	of deploying	an	application,	where	choosing	the	best	way	depends	on	the requirements.	Deploying	an	application	correctly	is	very	important	from	a security	and	performance	point	of	view.	There	are	multiple	ways	of	monitoring an	application	after	deployment,	of	which	some	are	paid	and	others	are	free	to use.	Using	them	depends	on	the	requirements	and	features	that	are	offered	by them.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	talk	about	various	application-deployment	techniques, followed	by	some	monitoring	tools	that	are	used	post-deployment.  Each	of	the	tools	and	techniques	we	will	cover	have	their	own	sets	of	features. For	example,	adding	too	much	monitoring	to	an	application	can	prove	to	be	an extra	overhead	to	the	application	and	the	developers	as	well.	Similarly,	missing out	on	monitoring	can	lead	to	undetected	user	errors	and	overall	user dissatisfaction.  Hence,	we	should	choose	the	tools	that	we	use	wisely,	which,	in	turn,	will	ease our	lives	as	much	as	possible.  In	terms	of	post-deployment	monitoring	tools,	we	will	discuss	New	Relic.	Sentry is	another	tool	that	will	prove	to	be	the	most	beneficial	of	all	from	a	developer's perspective.	It	has	already	been	covered	in	the	Using	Sentry	to	monitor exceptions	recipe	in	Chapter	10,	Debugging,	Error	Handling,	and	Testing.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Deploying	with	Apache Deploying	with	uWSGI	and	Nginx Deploying	with	Gunicorn	and	Supervisor Deploying	with	Tornado Using	S3	storage	for	file	uploads   Deploying	with	Heroku Deploying	with	AWS	Elastic	Beanstalk Managing	and	monitoring	application	performance	with	New	Relic   Deploying	with	Apache  In	this	recipe,	we	will	learn	how	to	deploy	a	Flask	application	with	Apache, which	is,	arguably,	the	most	popular	HTTP	server.	For	Python	web	applications, we	will	use	mod_wsgi,	which	implements	a	simple	Apache	module	that	can	host any	Python	applications	that	support	the	WSGI	interface.  Remember	that	mod_wsgi	is	not	the	same	as	Apache	and	needs	to	be	installed	separately.   Getting	ready  We	will	start	with	our	catalog	application	and	make	appropriate	changes	to	it	to make	it	deployable	using	the	Apache	HTTP	server.  First,	we	should	make	our	application	installable	so	that	our	application	and	all its	libraries	are	on	the	Python	load	path.	This	can	be	done	using	a	setup.py	script, as	shown	in	the	Making	a	Flask	app	installable	using	setuptools	recipe	in	Chapter	 1,	Flask	Configurations.	There	will	be	a	few	changes	to	the	script	as	per	this application.	The	major	changes	are	mentioned	here:  packages=[	 				'my_app',	 				'my_app.catalog',	 ],	 include_package_data=True,	 zip_safe	=	False, install_requires=[ 				'Flask>=0.10.1', 				'flask-sqlalchemy', 				'flask-wtf', 				'flask-babel', 				'sentry-sdk', 				'blinker', 				'geoip2', ],	  First,	we	mentioned	all	the	packages	that	need	to	be	installed	as	part	of	our application.	Each	of	these	needs	to	have	an	__init__.py	file.	The	zip_safe	flag	tells the	installer	to	not	install	this	application	as	a	ZIP	file.	The	include_package_data statement	reads	from	a	MANIFEST.in	file	in	the	same	folder	and	includes	any package	data	mentioned	here.	Our	MANIFEST.in	file	looks	as	follows:  recursive-include	my_app templates	*	 recursive-include	my_app static	*	 recursive-include	my_app translations	*	  Now,	just	install	the	application	using	the	following	command:  				$	python	setup.py	install	  Installing	mod_wsgi	is	usually	OS-specific.	Installing	it	on	a	Debian-based	distribution	should be	as	easy	as	using	the	packaging	tool,	that	is,	apt	or	aptitude. For	example,	on	Ubuntu	18.04,	it	is	as	easy	as	running	the	following	command:	$	sudo	apt-get install	libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3.   For	more	details,	refer	to	https:  modwsgi.readthedocs.io en develop installation.html	and	https:  github.com G rahamDumpleton mod_wsgi.   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	deploy	a	Flask	application	using	Apache:  1.	 We	need	to	create	some	more	files,	the	first	one	being	app.wsgi.	This	loads  our	application	as	a	WSGI	application:  activate_this	=	'  bin activate_this.py'	 exec open activate_this .read  ,	dict __file__=activate_this  	 	 from	my_app	import	app	as	application	 import	sys,	logging	 logging.basicConfig stream	=	sys.stderr 	  Since	we	perform	all	our	installations	inside	virtualenv,	we	need	to activate	the	environment	before	our	application	is	loaded.	In	the	case	of system-wide	installations,	the	first	two	statements	aren't	needed.	Then, we	need	to	import	our	app	object	as	application,	which	is	used	as	the application	that's	being	served.	The	last	two	lines	are	optional,	as	they just	stream	the	output	to	the	standard	logger,	which	is	disabled	by	mod_wsgi by	default.  The	app	object	needs	to	be	imported	as	application	since	mod_wsgi	expects	the	application keyword.  2.	 Next	comes	a	config	file	that	will	be	used	by	the	Apache	HTTP	server	to  serve	our	application	correctly	from	specific	locations.	The	file	is named	apache_wsgi.conf:   	 	 				WSGIScriptAlias	 	  flask_catalog_deployment app.wsgi	 	 				  flask_catalog_deployment>	 								Require	all	granted	 								Allow	from	all	 				 	 	  	  The	preceding	code	is	the	Apache	configuration	that	tells	the	HTTP server	about	the	various	directories	from	where	the	application	has	to	be loaded.   3.	 The	final	step	is	to	add	the	apache_wsgi.conf	file	to	 etc apache2 apache2.conf	so  that	our	application	is	loaded	when	the	server	runs.	You	might	need	to disable	the	current	sites-enabled	inclusion	from	apache2.conf:  Include	  flask_catalog_deployment apache_wsgi.conf	   How	it	works...  Restart	the	Apache	server	service	using	the	following	command:  $	sudo	systemctl	restart	apache2.service	  Open	http:  127.0.0.1 	in	the	browser	to	see	the	application's	home	page.	Any errors	that	come	up	can	be	seen	at	 var log apache2 error_log	 this	path	may	differ, depending	on	the	OS	that	you	are	using .   There's	more...  After	all	of	this,	it	is	possible	that	the	product	images	being	uploaded	as	part	of the	product	creation	don't	work.	For	this,	we	should	make	a	small	modification to	our	application's	configuration:  app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']	=	'  flask_test_uploads'	  We	opted	for	a	static	path	because	we	don't	want	it	to	change	every	time	the application	is	modified	or	installed.  Now,	we	will	include	the	path	that	was	chosen	in	the	preceding	code in	apache_wsgi.conf:  Alias	 static uploads 	"<Some	static	absolute	 			path> flask_test_uploads "	   flask_test_uploads">	 				Require	all	granted	 				Options	Indexes	 				Allow	from	all	 				IndexOptions	FancyIndexing	  	  After	this,	install	the	application	and	restart	apache2.service.   See	also  Refer	to	http:  httpd.apache.org 	to	read	more	about	Apache. More	about	modwsgi	inception	can	be	found	at	https:  code.google.com p modws gi .  The	latest	documentation	on	modwgsi	can	be	found	at	https:  modwsgi.readthe docs.io en develop . You	can	read	about	WSGI	in	general	at	http:  wsgi.readthedocs.org en latest .   Deploying	with	uWSGI	and	Nginx  For	those	who	are	already	aware	of	the	usefulness	of	uWSGI	and	Nginx,	not much	needs	to	be	explained.	uWSGI	is	a	protocol	as	well	as	an	application server	and	provides	a	complete	stack	so	that	you	can	build	hosting	services. Nginx	is	a	reverse	proxy	and	HTTP	server	that	is	very	lightweight	and	capable of	handling	virtually	unlimited	requests.	Nginx	works	seamlessly	with	uWSGI and	provides	many	under-the-hood	optimizations	for	better	performance.	In	this recipe,	we	will	use	uWSGI	and	Nginx	together	to	facilitate	the	deployment	of our	application.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	our	application	from	the	previous	recipe,	Deploying	with	Apache, and	use	the	same	app.wsgi,	setup.py,	and	MANIFEST.in	files.	Any	other	changes	that were	made	to	the	application's	configuration	in	the	last	recipe	will	apply	to	this recipe	as	well.  Disable	any	other	HTTP	servers	that	might	be	running,	such	as	Apache	and	so	on.   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	deploy	the	application	using	uWSGI	and	Nginx:  1.	 First,	we	need	to	install	uWSGI	and	Nginx.	On	Debian-based	distributions such	as	Ubuntu,	they	can	be	easily	installed	using	the	following	commands:  				$	sudo	apt-get	install	nginx 				$	pip3	install	uWSGI  Again,	these	are	OS-specific,	so	please	refer	to	the	respective documentations	as	per	the	OS	that	you're	using.  Make	sure	that	you	have	a	sites-enabled	folder	for	Nginx,	since	this	is where	we	will	keep	our	site-specific	configuration	files.	Usually,	it	is already	present	in	most	installations	in	the	 etc 	folder.	If	not,	please	refer to	the	OS-specific	documentation	for	your	OS	to	figure	this	out.  2.	 Next,	we	will	create	a	file	named	uwsgi.ini	in	our	application:  [uwsgi]	 http-socket				=	:9090	 plugin				=	python	 wsgi-file	=	  flask_catalog_deployment app.wsgi	 processes			=	3	  3.	 To	test	whether	uWSGI	is	working	as	expected,	run	the	following  command:  				$	uwsgi	--ini	uwsgi.ini	  The	preceding	file	and	command	are	equivalent	to	running	the	following command:  				$	uwsgi	--http-socket	:9090	--plugin	python	--wsgi-file	app.wsgi	  Now,	point	your	browser	to	http:  127.0.0.1:9090 ;	this	should	open	up	the home	page	of	the	application.  4.	 Before	moving	on,	edit	the	preceding	file	in	order	to	replace	http-socket  with	socket.	This	changes	the	protocol	from	HTTP	to	uWSGI	 you	can	read   more	about	this	at	http:  uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org en latest Protocol.html .  You	might	want	to	keep	the	uWSGI	process	running	automatically	in	the	background	as	a headless	service	rather	than	having	it	run	manually	in	the	foreground.	There	are	multiple tools	to	do	this,	such	as	supervisord,	circus,	and	so	on.	We	will	touch	on	supervisord	in	the	next recipe	for	a	different	purpose,	but	that	can	be	replicated	here	as	well.	I	will	leave	it	to	you to	try	this	out	for	yourself.  5.	 Now,	create	a	new	file	called	nginx-wsgi.conf.	This	contains	the	Nginx  configuration	that's	needed	to	serve	our	application	and	the	static	content:  server	{ 		location	 	{	 				include	uwsgi_params;	 				uwsgi_pass	127.0.0.1:9090;	 		}	 		location	 static uploads 	{	 				alias	  flask_test_uploads ;	 		}	 }  In	the	preceding	code	block,	uwsgi_pass	specifies	the	uWSGI	server	that needs	to	be	mapped	to	the	specified	location.  The	nginx-wsgi.conf	file	can	be	created	anywhere.	It	can	be	created	with	your	code	bundle	so that	it	can	be	version	controlled,	or	it	can	also	be	placed	at	 etc nginx sites-available	for	easier maintenance	if	you	have	multiple	.conf	files.  6.	 Create	a	soft	link	of	this	file	to	the	sites-enabled	folder	we	mentioned	earlier  using	the	following	command:  $	ln	-s	 	 	  7.	 Edit	the	nginx.conf	file	 usually	found	at	 etc nginx nginx.conf 	to	add	the  following	line	inside	the	first	server	block	before	the	last	}:  include	  nginx-wsgi.conf;	  8.	 After	all	of	this,	reload	the	Nginx	server	using	the	following	command:  $	sudo	systemctl	reload	nginx.service	  Point	your	browser	to	http:  127.0.0.1 	to	see	the	application	that	serves	via	Nginx and	uWSGI.   See	also  Refer	to	https:  uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org en latest 	for	more	information	on uWSGI. Refer	to	https:  www.nginx.com 	for	more	information	on	Nginx.  There	is	a	good	article	by	DigitalOcean	on	the	Nginx	and	uWSGI.	I	advise you	to	go	through	it	so	that	you	have	a	better	understanding	of	the	topic.	It is	available	at	https:  www.digitalocean.com community tutorials how-to-serve-flask- applications-with-uswgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04. To	get	an	insight	into	the	differences	between	Apache	and	Nginx,	I	think	an article	by	Anturis,	which	can	be	found	at	https:  anturis.com blog nginx-vs-apac he ,	is	pretty	good.   Deploying	with	Gunicorn	and Supervisor Gunicorn	is	a	WSGI	HTTP	server	for	Unix.	It	is	very	simple	to	implement,	ultra light,	and	fairly	speedy.	Its	simplicity	lies	in	its	broad	compatibility	with	various web	frameworks.  Supervisor	is	a	monitoring	tool	that	controls	various	child	processes	and handles	starting restarting	these	child	processes	when	they	exit	abruptly,	or	due to	some	other	reason.	It	can	be	extended	to	control	processes	via	the	XML-RPC API	over	remote	locations	without	logging	in	to	the	server	 we	won't	discuss	this here	as	it	is	beyond	the	scope	of	this	book .  One	thing	to	remember	is	that	these	tools	can	be	used	along	with	the	other	tools mentioned	in	the	applications	in	the	previous	recipe,	such	as	using	Nginx	as	a proxy	server.	This	is	left	to	you	to	try	out.   Getting	ready  We	will	start	with	the	installation	of	both	the	packages,	that	is,	gunicorn	and supervisor.	Both	can	be	directly	installed	using	pip3:  $	pip3	install	gunicorn $	pip3	install	supervisor	   How	to	do	it...  To	check	whether	the	gunicorn	package	works	as	expected,	just	run	the	following command	from	inside	our	application	folder:  $	gunicorn	-w	4	-b	127.0.0.1:8000	my_app:app  After	this,	point	your	browser	to	http:  127.0.0.1:8000 	to	see	the	application's home	page.	Now,	we	can	get	started:  1.	 Now,	we	need	to	do	the	same	using	Supervisor	so	that	this	runs	as	a  daemon	that	will	be	controlled	by	Supervisor	itself	rather	than through	human	intervention.	First	of	all,	we	need	a	Supervisor configuration	file.	This	can	be	achieved	by	running	the	following	command from	virtualenv.	Supervisor,	by	default,	looks	for	an	etc	folder	that	has	a	file named	supervisord.conf.	In	system-wide	installations,	this	folder	is	 etc ,	and in	virtualenv,	it	will	look	for	an	etc	folder	in	virtualenv	and	then	fall	back	to  etc .	Hence,	it	is	suggested	to	create	a	folder	named	etc	in	your	virtualenv	to maintain	separation	of	concerns:  				$	echo_supervisord_conf	>	etc supervisord.conf	  The	echo_supervisord_conf	program	is	provided	by	Supervisor;	it	prints	a	sample	config	file	to the	location	specified.	If	you	run	into	permission	issues	while	running	the	command,	try	using sudo.  2.	 The	previous	command	will	create	a	file	named	supervisord.conf	in	the	etc  folder.	Add	the	following	block	in	this	file:  [program:flask_catalog]	 command=  bin gunicorn	-w	4	-b	127.0.0.1:8000	my_app:app	 directory= 	 user=someuser		Relevant	user	 autostart=true	 autorestart=true	 stdout_logfile= tmp app.log	 stderr_logfile= tmp error.log	  Make	a	note	that	you	should	never	run	the	applications	as	a	root	user.	This	is	a	huge	security flaw	in	itself	as	the	application	may	crash	or	the	flaws	may	harm	the	OS	itself.  3.	 After	the	setup	is	complete,	run	supervisord	by	using	the	following  command:   				$	supervisord   How	it	works...  To	check	the	status	of	the	application,	run	the	following	command:  $	supervisorctl	status flask_catalog			RUNNING			pid	40466,	uptime	0:00:03	  This	command	provides	a	status	for	all	of	the	child	processes.  The	tools	that	were	discussed	in	this	recipe	can	be	coupled	with	Nginx	to	serve	as	a	reverse proxy	server.	I	suggest	that	you	try	this	out	for	yourself.  Every	time	you	make	a	change	to	your	application	and	then	wish	to	restart Gunicorn	in	order	for	it	to	reflect	the	changes	that	have	been	made,	run	the following	command:  $	supervisorctl	restart	all	  You	can	also	specify	specific	processes	instead	of	restarting	everything:  	$	supervisorctl	restart	flask_catalog	   See	also  You	can	read	more	about	Gunicorn	at	http:  gunicorn-docs.readthedocs.org en la test index.html. For	more	information	on	Supervisor,	please	refer	to	http:  supervisord.org ind ex.html.   Deploying	with	Tornado  Tornado	is	a	complete	web	framework	and	a	standalone	web	server	in	itself. Here,	we	will	use	Flask	to	create	our	application,	which	is	basically	a combination	of	URL	routing	and	templating,	and	leave	the	server	part	to Tornado.	Tornado	is	built	to	hold	thousands	of	simultaneous	standing connections	and	makes	applications	very	scalable.  Tornado	has	limitations	while	working	with	WSGI	applications,	so	choose	wisely!	You	can read	more	at	http:  www.tornadoweb.org en stable wsgi.htmlrunning-wsgi-apps-on-tornado-servers.   Getting	ready  Installing	Tornado	can	be	done	using	pip3:  $	pip3	install	tornado	   Let's	create	a	file	named	tornado_server.py	and	put	the	following	code	in	it:  How	to	do	it...  from	tornado.wsgi	import	WSGIContainer	 from	tornado.httpserver	import	HTTPServer	 from	tornado.ioloop	import	IOLoop	 from	my_app	import	app	 	 http_server	=	HTTPServer WSGIContainer app  	 http_server.listen 5000 	 IOLoop.instance  .start  	  Here,	we	created	a	WSGI	container	for	our	application;	this	container	is	then used	to	create	an	HTTP	server,	and	the	application	is	hosted	on	port	5000.   How	it	works...  Run	the	Python	file	we	created	in	the	previous	section	using	the	following command:  $	python	tornado_server.py	  Point	your	browser	to	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 	to	see	the	home	page	being	served.  We	can	couple	Tornado	with	Nginx	 as	a	reverse	proxy	to	serve	static	content 	and	Supervisor  as	a	process	manager 	for	the	best	results.	This	is	left	for	you	as	an	exercise.   Using	S3	storage	for	file	uploads  Amazon	explains	S3	as	the	storage	for	the	internet	that	is	designed	to	make	web- scale	computing	easier	for	the	developers.	S3	provides	a	very	simple	interface via	web	services;	this	makes	the	storage	and	retrieval	of	any	amount	of	data	very simple	at	any	time	from	anywhere	on	the	internet.	Until	now,	in	our	catalog application,	we	saw	that	there	were	issues	in	managing	the	product	images	that were	uploaded	as	a	part	of	the	creation	process.	This	whole	headache	will	go away	if	the	images	are	stored	somewhere	globally	and	are	easily	accessible	from anywhere.	We	will	use	S3	for	the	same	purpose.   Getting	ready Amazon	offers	boto3,	a	complete	Python	library	that	interfaces	with	Amazon Web	Services	via	web	services.	Almost	all	of	the	AWS	features	can	be controlled	using	boto.	It	can	be	installed	using	pip3:  $	pip3	install	boto3	   How	to	do	it...  Now,	make	some	changes	to	our	existing	catalog	application	to	accommodate support	for	file	upload	and	retrieval	from	S3:  1.	 First,	we	need	to	store	the	AWS-specific	configuration	to	allow	boto	to  make	calls	to	S3.	Add	the	following	statements	to	the	application's configuration	file,	that	is,	my_app __init__.py:  app.config['AWS_ACCESS_KEY']	=	'Amazon	Access	Key'	 app.config['AWS_SECRET_KEY']	=	'Amazon	Secret	Key'	 app.config['AWS_BUCKET']	=	'Your	S3	Bucket	Name'	  2.	 Next,	we	need	to	change	our	views.py	file:  from	boto3	  This	is	the	import	that	we	need	from	boto.	Next,	we	need	to	replace	the following	line	in	create_product  :  image.save os.path.join app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'],	filename  	  This	will	be	replaced	with	the	following	block	of	code:  session	=	boto3.Session  				aws_access_key_id=app.config['AWS_ACCESS_KEY'], 				aws_secret_access_key=app.config['AWS_SECRET_KEY']   s3	=	session.resource 's3'  bucket	=	s3.Bucket app.config['AWS_BUCKET']  if	bucket	not	in	list s3.buckets.all   : 				bucket	=	s3.create_bucket  								Bucket=app.config['AWS_BUCKET'], 								CreateBucketConfiguration={ 												'LocationConstraint':	'ap-south-1' 								}, 				  bucket.upload_fileobj  				image,	filename, 				ExtraArgs={'ACL':	'public-read'}   With	this	code	change,	we	are	essentially	changing	how	we	save	files. Earlier,	the	image	was	being	saved	locally	using	image.save.	Now	this	is done	by	creating	a	S3	connection	and	uploading	the	image	to	a	bucket there.	First,	we	create	a	session	connection	with	AWS	using	boto3.Session.   We	use	this	session	to	access	S3	resources	and	then	create	a	bucket	 if	it doesn't	exist;	otherwise,	use	the	same 	with	a	location	constraint	to	'ap- south-1'.	This	location	constraint	isn't	necessary	and	can	be	used	as needed.	Finally,	we	upload	our	image	to	the	bucket.  3.	 The	last	bit	of	change	will	go	to	our	product.html	template,	where	we	need	to change	the	image's	src	path.	Replace	the	original	img	src	statement	with	the following	statement:  <img	src="{{	'https:  s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com '	+	config['AWS_BUCKET']	+	 			' '	+	product.image_path	}}" >	   How	it	works...  Now,	run	the	application	as	usual	and	create	a	product.	When	the	created product	is	rendered,	the	product	image	will	take	a	bit	of	time	to	come	up	as	it	is now	being	served	from	S3	 and	not	from	a	local	machine .	If	this	happens,	then the	integration	with	S3	has	been	successful.   See	also  Read	the	next	recipe,	Deploying	with	Heroku,	to	see	how	S3	is	instrumental	in easy	deployment	without	the	hassles	of	managing	uploads	on	the	server.   Deploying	with	Heroku  Heroku	is	a	cloud	application	platform	that	provides	an	easy	and	quick	way	to build	and	deploy	web	applications.	Heroku	manages	the	servers,	deployments, and	their	related	operations	while	developers	spend	their	time	on	developing applications.	Deploying	with	Heroku	is	pretty	simple	with	the	help	of	the Heroku	Command	Line	Interface	 CLI ,	which	is	a	bundle	of	some	tools	that make	deployment	with	Heroku	a	cakewalk.   Getting	ready  We	will	proceed	with	the	application	from	the	previous	recipe	that	has	S3 support	for	uploads.  The	first	step	will	be	to	create	a	free	account	with	Heroku	at	https:  signup.heroku. com dc,	followed	by	downloading	and	installing	the	Heroku	CLI,	which	is available	as	per	your	machine's	OS	from	https:  devcenter.heroku.com articles heroku -clidownload-and-install.  Once	the	Heroku	CLI	has	been	installed,	a	certain	set	of	commands	will	be available	in	the	Terminal;	we	will	look	at	them	later	in	this	recipe.  It	is	advised	that	you	perform	Heroku	deployment	from	a	fresh	virtualenv,	where	we	have	only the	required	packages	for	our	application	installed	and	nothing	else.	This	will	make	the deployment	process	faster	and	easier.  Now,	run	the	following	command	to	log	in	to	your	Heroku	account	and	sync your	machine's	SSH	key	with	the	server:  $	heroku	login heroku:	Press	any	key	to	open	up	the	browser	to	login	or	q	to	exit: Opening	browser	to	https:  cli-auth.heroku.com auth browser   Logging	in...	done Logged	in	as	   You	will	be	prompted	to	create	a	new	SSH	key	if	one	doesn't	exist.	Proceed accordingly.   How	to	do	it...  Now	that	we	have	an	application	that	needs	to	be	deployed	to	Heroku,	let's	get started:  1.	 First,	Heroku	needs	to	know	the	command	that	it	needs	to	run	while  deploying	the	application.	This	is	done	in	a	file	named	Procfile:  web:	gunicorn	-w	4	my_app:app	  Here,	we	will	tell	Heroku	to	run	this	command	in	order	to	run	our	web application.  There	are	a	lot	of	different	configurations	and	commands	that	can	go	into	Procfile.	For more	details,	read	the	Heroku	documentation	at	https:  devcenter.heroku.com articles procfile.  2.	 Heroku	needs	to	know	the	dependencies	that	it	needs	to	install	in	order	to  successfully	install	and	run	our	application.	This	is	done	via	the requirements.txt	file:  Babel==2.6.0 blinker==1.4 boto3==1.9.145 botocore==1.12.145 certifi==2019.3.9 chardet==3.0.4 Click==7.0 docutils==0.14 Flask==1.0.2 Flask-Babel==0.12.2 Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.4.0 Flask-WTF==0.14.2 geoip2==2.9.0 gunicorn==19.9.0 idna==2.8 itsdangerous==1.1.0 Jinja2==2.10.1 jmespath==0.9.4 MarkupSafe==1.1.1 maxminddb==1.4.1 python-dateutil==2.8.0 pytz==2019.1 requests==2.21.0 s3transfer==0.2.0 sentry-sdk==0.7.14 six==1.12.0 SQLAlchemy==1.3.3 urllib3==1.24.3 Werkzeug==0.15.2 WTForms==2.2.1   WTForms==2.2.1  This	file	contains	all	the	dependencies	of	our	application,	the dependencies	of	these	dependencies,	and	so	on.	An	easy	way	to	generate this	file	is	by	using	the	pip3	freeze	command:  				$	pip3	freeze	>	requirements.txt	  This	will	create update	the	requirements.txt	file	with	all	the	packages	that are	installed	in	virtualenv.  3.	 Now,	create	a	Git	repository	of	our	application.	For	this,	run	the	following  commands:  				$	git	init 				$	git	add	. 				$	git	commit	-m	"First	Commit"	  The	preceding	commands	result	in	the	creation	of	a	Git	repository	with all	our	files	added	to	it.  Make	sure	that	you	have	a	.gitignore	file	in	your	repository	or	at	a	global	level	to	prevent temporary	files	such	as	.pyc	from	being	added	to	it.  4.	 Next,	create	a	Heroku	application	and	push	our	application	to	Heroku:  				$	heroku	create 				Creating	app...	done,	⬢	boiling-sierra-76020 				https:  boiling-sierra-76020.herokuapp.com 		 				https:  git.heroku.com boiling-sierra-76020.git 				$	git	push	heroku	master 		  After	the	previous	command	has	been	run,	a	whole	lot	of	stuff	will	get printed	on	the	Terminal;	this	will	indicate	all	the	packages	being installed,	as	well	as	the	application	being	launched.   How	it	works...  After	the	previous	commands	have	successfully	finished,	just	open	up	the	URL provided	by	Heroku	at	the	end	of	deployment	in	a	browser,	or	run	the	following command:  $	heroku	open	  This	will	open	up	the	application's	home	page.	Try	creating	a	new	product	with an	image	and	see	the	image	being	served	from	Amazon	S3.  To	see	the	logs	of	the	application,	run	the	following	command:  $	heroku	logs	--tail	   There's	more...  There	is	a	glitch	with	the	deployment	we	just	did.	Every	time	we	update	the deployment	via	the	git	push	command,	the	SQLite	database	gets	overwritten.	The solution	to	this	is	to	use	the	Postgres	setup	provided	by	Heroku	itself.	I	urge	you to	try	this	yourself.	Refer	to	https:  devcenter.heroku.com articles heroku-postgresqlpr ovisioning-heroku-postgres	to	learn	to	how	do	this.   Deploying	with	AWS	Elastic Beanstalk  In	the	previous	recipe,	we	saw	how	deployment	to	servers	becomes	easy	with Heroku.	Similarly,	Amazon	has	a	service	named	Elastic	Beanstalk	that	allows developers	to	deploy	their	application	to	Amazon	EC2	instances	as	easily	as possible.	With	just	a	few	configuration	options,	a	Flask	application	can	be deployed	to	AWS	using	Elastic	Beanstalk	in	a	couple	of	minutes.   Getting	ready  We	will	start	with	our	catalog	application	from	the	previous	recipe,	Deploying with	Heroku.	The	only	file	that	remains	the	same	from	this	recipe	is requirement.txt.	The	rest	of	the	files	that	were	added	as	a	part	of	that	recipe	can	be ignored	or	discarded	for	this	recipe.  Now,	the	first	thing	that	we	need	to	do	is	download	the	setup	repository	of	the AWS	Elastic	Beanstalk	CLI	from	GitHub.	Clone	this	repository	and	place	it somewhere	suitable;	preferably	your	workspace	home:  	$	git	clone	https:  github.com aws aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup.git  The	next	step	is	to	run	the	bundled	installer	that	we	downloaded	in	the	previous step:  	$	. aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup scripts bundled_installer  Follow	the	instructions	that	are	printed	on	the	Terminal	window	when	the installer	runs.	These	are	crucial	to	make	sure	that	eb	is	in	PATH	so	that	the	Elastic Beanstalk	CLI	commands	can	be	executed.	It	should	look	something	like	this:   How	to	do	it...  There	are	a	few	conventions	that	need	to	be	followed	in	order	to	deploy	using Beanstalk.	It	assumes	that	there	will	be	a	file	called	application.py,	which	contains the	application	object	 in	our	case,	the	app	object .	Beanstalk	treats	this	file	as	the WSGI	file,	and	this	is	used	for	deployment.	Let's	get	started.  In	the	Deploying	with	Apache	recipe,	we	had	a	file	named	app.wgsi	where	we	referred	to	our app	object	as	application	because	apache mod_wsgi	needed	it	to	be	so.	The	same	thing	happens	here because	Amazon,	by	default,	deploys	using	Apache	behind	the	scenes.  1.	 The	contents	of	this	application.py	file	will	be	just	a	few	lines	long,	as	shown  here:  from	my_app	import	app	as	application	 import	sys,	logging	 logging.basicConfig stream	=	sys.stderr 	  2.	 Now,	create	a	Git	repository	in	the	application	and	commit	with	all	the	files  that	were	added:  				$	git	init 				$	git	add	. 				$	git	commit	-m	"First	Commit"	  Make	sure	that	you	have	a	.gitignore	file	in	your	repository	or	at	a	global	level	to	prevent temporary	files	such	as	.pyc	from	being	added	to	it.  3.	 Then,	deploy	to	Elastic	Beanstalk.	Run	the	following	command	to	do	this:  				$	eb	init  The	preceding	command	initializes	the	process	for	the	configuration	of your	Elastic	Beanstalk	instance.	It	will	ask	for	the	AWS	credentials, followed	by	a	lot	of	other	configuration	options	that	are	needed	for	the creation	of	the	EC2	instance,	which	can	be	selected	as	needed.	For	more help	on	these	options,	refer	to	http:  docs.aws.amazon.com elasticbeanstalk late st dg create_deploy_Python_flask.html.  4.	 After	this	is	done,	run	the	following	command	to	trigger	the	creation	of  servers,	followed	by	the	deployment	of	the	application:   				$	eb	create	 	  Behind	the	scenes,	the	preceding	command	creates	the	EC2	instance,	a	volume,	assigns	an elastic	IP,	and	then	pushes	our	application	to	the	newly	created	server	for	deployment.  This	will	take	a	few	minutes	to	complete.	Once	this	is	done,	you	can check	the	status	of	your	application	using	the	following	command:  				$	eb	status	--verbose  After	the	application	has	been	successfully	deployed,	run	the	following command	to	open	the	application	in	a	browser:  Whenever	you	need	to	update	your	application,	just	commit	your	changes	using the	following	command:  				$	eb	open  				$	eb	deploy   How	it	works...  When	the	deployment	process	finishes,	it	gives	out	the	application	URL.	Point your	browser	this	to	see	the	application	being	served.  However,	you	will	find	a	small	glitch	with	the	application.	The	static	content, that	is,	the	CSS	and	JS	code,	is	not	being	served.	This	is	because	the	static	path isn't	being	comprehended	correctly	by	Beanstalk.	This	can	be	fixed	by	simply modifying	the	application's	configuration	on	your	application's monitoring configuration	page	in	the	AWS	management	console.	Check	out	the following	screenshots	to	understand	this	better:  Click	on	the	Configuration	menu	item	on	the	left-hand	side:  Notice	the	highlighted	box	in	the	preceding	screenshot.	This	is	what	we	need	to change,	as	per	our	application.	Open	Software	Settings:   Change	the	virtual	path	for	 static ,	as	shown	in	the	preceding	screenshot.  After	this	change	has	been	made,	the	environment	that	was	created	by	Elastic Beanstalk	will	be	updated	automatically,	although	it	will	take	a	bit	of	time.	Once this	is	done,	check	the	application	again	to	see	the	static	content	also	being served	correctly.   Managing	and	monitoring	application performance	with	New	Relic New	Relic	is	an	analytics	software	that	provides	near	real-time	operational	and business	analytics	related	to	your	application.	It	provides	deep	analytics	on	the behavior	of	the	application	from	various	aspects.	It	does	the	job	of	a	profiler,	as well	as	eliminate	the	need	to	maintain	extra	moving	parts	in	the	application.	It works	in	the	data	push	principle	where	our	application	sends	data	to	New	Relic rather	than	New	Relic	asking	for	statistics	from	our	application.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	the	application	from	the	previous	recipe,	which	has	been	deployed to	AWS.  The	first	step	will	be	to	sign	up	with	New	Relic	for	an	account.	Follow	the simple	sign	up	process	and,	upon	completion	and	email	verification,	you	will	be sent	to	your	dashboard.	Here,	choose	APM	as	the	product	that	we	need	to	use from	the	suite	of	offerings	from	New	Relic:  From	here,	you	can	get	your	license	key,	which	we	will	use	later	to	connect	our application	to	this	account.	The	dashboard	should	look	as	follows:   Here,	click	on	the	large	button	that	says	Reveal	license	key.   How	to	do	it...  Once	we	have	the	license	key,	we	need	to	install	the	newrelic	Python	library:  $	pip3	install	newrelic  1.	 Now,	we	need	to	generate	a	file	called	newrelic.ini,	which	will	contain  details	regarding	the	license	key,	the	name	of	our	application,	and	so	on. This	can	be	done	using	the	following	commands:  $	newrelic-admin	generate-config	 	newrelic.ini	  In	the	preceding	command,	replace	LICENSE-KEY	with	the	actual	license	key of	your	account.	Now	we	have	a	new	file	called	newrelic.ini.	Open	and edit	the	file	in	terms	of	the	application	name	and	anything	else,	as needed.  2.	 To	check	whether	the	newrelic.ini	file	is	working	successfully,	run	the  following	command:  $	newrelic-admin	validate-config	newrelic.ini	  This	will	tell	us	whether	the	validation	was	successful	or	not.	If	not,	then check	the	license	key	and	its	validity.  3.	 Now,	add	the	following	lines	at	the	top	of	the	application's	configuration file,	which	is	my_app __init__.py	in	our	case.	Make	sure	that	you	add	these lines	before	anything	else	is	imported:  import	newrelic.agent	 newrelic.agent.initialize 'newrelic.ini' 	  4.	 Now,	we	need	to	update	the	requirements.txt	file.	Run	the	following  command:  $	pip3	freeze	>	requirements.txt  5.	 After	this,	commit	the	changes	and	deploy	the	application	to	AWS	using  the	following	command:   $	eb	deploy   How	it	works...  Once	the	application	has	been	successfully	updated	on	AWS,	it	will	start	sending statistics	to	New	Relic,	and	the	dashboard	will	have	a	new	application	added	to it.	In	the	following	screenshot,	there	are	two	applications,	where	the	first	one corresponds	to	the	application	that	we	are	working	one	and	the	second	one	is	the test	that	we	ran	a	while	back	to	validate	whether	New	Relic	is	working	correctly:  Open	the	application-specific	page,	and	a	whole	lot	of	statistics	will	appear.	It will	also	show	you	which	calls	have	taken	the	most	amount	of	time	and	how	the application	is	performing.	You	will	also	see	multiple	tabs,	where	each	one	will correspond	to	a	different	type	of	monitoring	in	order	to	cover	all	the	necessary aspects.   See	also  Read	the	Deploying	with	AWS	Elastic	Beanstalk	recipe	to	understand	the deployment	part	that	was	used	in	this	recipe.   Microservices	and	Containers  Up	until	now,	we	have	been	developing	the	complete	application	as	one	block	of code	 usually	known	as	a	monolith ,	which	is	typically	designed,	tested,	and deployed	as	a	single	unit.	Scaling	will	also	happen	in	a	similar	manner,	where either	the	whole	application	is	scaled	or	not.	As	the	application	grows	in	size,	it is	natural	to	have	an	inclination	toward	breaking	the	monolith	into	smaller chunks	that	can	be	separately	managed	and	scaled.	A	solution	to	this	is microservices.	This	chapter	is	all	about	microservices,	and	we	will	look	at	a	few methodologies	of	creating	and	managing	them.  Microservices	is	a	method	of	developing	and	architecting	software	applications as	a	collection	of	multiple	loosely-coupled	services.	These	services	are	designed and	developed	with	the	goal	of	building	single	function	modules	that	have	clear and	fine-grained	interfaces.	The	benefit	of	this	modularity,	if	designed	and architected	properly,	is	that	the	overall	application	becomes	easier	to	understand, develop,	maintain,	and	test.	Multiple	small	autonomous	teams	can	work	in parallel	on	multiple	microservices,	and	so	the	time	to	develop	and	deliver	an application	is	effectively	reduced.	Each	microservice	can	now	be	deployed	and scaled	separately,	which	allows	for	less	downtime	and	cost-effective	scaling since	only	the	high	traffic	services	can	be	scaled	based	on	predefined	criteria. Other	services	can	operate	as	usual.  This	chapter	will	start	with	some	of	the	common	terminology	that	you	might hear	when	microservices	are	talked	about,	that	is,	containers	and	Docker.	First, we	will	look	at	how	to	deploy	a	Flask	application	using	Docker	containers. Then,	we	will	look	at	how	multiple	containers	are	scaled	and	managed effectively	using	Kubernetes,	which	is	one	of	the	best	container	orchestration tools	available.	Finally,	we	will	look	at	how	to	create	fully-managed microservices	using	AWS	Lambda.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Containerization	with	Docker Orchestrating	containers	with	Kubernetes Going	serverless	with	Zappa	on	AWS	Lambda   Containerization	with	Docker  A	container	can	be	thought	of	as	a	standardized	package	of	code	that's	needed	to run	the	application	and	all	its	dependencies,	which	allows	the	application	to	run uniformly	across	multiple	environments	and	platforms.	Docker	is	a	tool	that allows	for	a	standard	and	easy	method	of	creating,	distributing,	deploying,	and running	applications	using	containers.	Docker	is	essentially	a	virtualization software,	but	instead	of	visualizing	the	whole	operating	system,	it	allows	the application	to	use	the	underlying	host	OS	and	requires	applications	to	package additional	dependencies	and	components	as	needed.	This	makes	Docker container	images	very	lightweight	and	easy	to	distribute.   $	docker	ps CONTAINER	ID								IMAGE															COMMAND													CREATED													STATUS														PORTS															NAMES  Getting	ready  The	first	step	is	to	install	Docker.	Docker	has	two	versions:	one	is	the Community	Edition	 Docker	CE ,	while	the	other	is	the	Enterprise	Edition  Docker	EE .	In	this	chapter,	we	will	only	use	Docker	CE.	Docker	installation steps	vary	in	terms	of	the	operating	system	you	use.	The	detailed	steps	for	each operating	system	can	be	found	at	https:  docs.docker.com install .	  Docker	is	a	fast-evolving	software	and	has	had	multiple	major	releases	in	the	last	few	years, where	a	lot	of	older	releases	have	been	deprecated.	I	would	suggest	that	you	always	read	the documentation	thoroughly	in	order	to	avoid	installing	any	legacy	versions	of	Docker.  Once	Docker	CE	has	been	successfully	installed,	head	over	to	the	Terminal	and run	the	following	command:  The	preceding	command	is	used	to	list	all	the	running	containers.	If	it	runs without	any	errors	and	shows	a	row	of	headers	that	start	with	CONTAINER	ID,	then Docker	has	been	successfully	installed.  Different	versions	of	Docker,	whether	old	or	current,	have	been	called	Docker	Toolbox, Docker	Machine,	Docker	Engine,	Docker	Desktop,	and	so	on.	These	names	will	appear multiple	times	across	the	documentation	and	might	change	in	the	future	as	well.	For	the	sake of	simplicity,	I	will	just	call	everything	Docker.  Another,	more	fun	way,	to	verify	the	Docker	installation	would	be	try	out	a hello-world	container.	Just	run	the	following	command:  				$	docker	run	hello-world  The	preceding	command	should	give	you	the	following	output.	It	lists	the	steps that	Docker	took	to	execute	this	command.	I	would	recommend	reading	through this:    How	to	do	it...  We	will	start	with	the	catalog	application	from	Chapter	11,	Deployment	and	Post- Deployment,	in	the	Managing	and	monitoring	application	performance	with New	Relic	recipe:  1.	 The	first	step	toward	creating	a	container	is	to	create	an	image	for	it.	A  Docker	image	can	easily	be	created	in	a	scripted	manner	by	creating	a	file named	Dockerfile.	This	file	contains	the	steps	that	Docker	needs	to	perform in	order	to	build	an	image	for	our	application's	container.	A	basic	Dockerfile for	our	application	would	be	as	follows:  FROM	python:3  WORKDIR	 usr src app  COPY	requirements.txt	requirements.txt RUN	pip3	install	-r	requirements.txt  COPY	.	.  ENTRYPOINT	[	"python"	] CMD	[	"run.py"	]  Each	line	in	the	preceding	file	is	a	command	that	is	executed	in	a	linear top-down	approach.	FROM	specifies	the	base	container	image	over	which the	new	image	for	our	application	container	will	be	built.	I	have	taken	the base	image	as	python:3,	which	is	a	Linux	image	with	Python	3.7	installed.  The	python:3	Docker	base	images	comes	with	Python	3.7	pre-installed	at	the	time	of	writing this	book.	This	might	change	over	time.  WORKDIR	indicates	the	default	directory	where	the	application	will	be installed.	I	have	set	it	to	 usr src app.	Any	commands	that	are	run	after	this would	be	executed	from	inside	this	folder.  COPY	simply	copies	the	files	specified	on	the	local	machine	to	the container	filesystem.	I	have	copied	requirements.txt	to	 usr src app.	  This	is	followed	by	RUN,	which	executes	the	command	provided.	I	had	.pip install	all	the	requirements	from	requirements.txt.	Then,	I	simply	copied	all   the	files	from	my	current	local	folder,	which	is	essentially	my	application root	folder,	to	 usr src app.	  Finally,	an	ENTRYPOINT	is	defined	that	indicates	the	default	CMD	command, which	should	be	run	when	a	container	is	started.	Here,	I	have	simply	run my	application	by	running	python	run.py.	  Dockerfile	provides	many	other	keywords,	all	of	which	can	be	used	to	create	powerful scripts.	Refer	to	https:  docs.docker.com engine reference builder 	for	more	information. There	can	be	multiple	ways	of	running	the	application,	as	outlined	in	Chapter	11,	Deployment and	Post-Deployment.	I	would	urge	you	to	use	those	methods	while	dockerizing	the application.  2.	 A	small	change	needs	to	made	to	run.py,	after	which	it	would	look	as  follows:  from	my_app	import	app app.run debug=True,	host='0.0.0.0'   I	have	added	the	host	parameter	in	app.run.	This	allows	the	application	to be	accessed	outside	the	Docker	container.  3.	 The	creation	of	Dockerfile	is	followed	by	building	a	Docker	container	image,  which	can	then	be	run:  $	docker	build	-t	cookbook	.  Here,	we	asked	Docker	to	build	an	image	using	the	Dockerfile	at	the	same location.	The	-t	argument	sets	the	name tag	for	the	image	that	would	be built.	The	final	argument	is	a	dot	 . ,	which	indicates	that	everything	in the	current	folder	needs	to	be	packaged	in	the	build.	This	command might	take	a	while	to	process	when	it's	run	for	the	first	time	because	it will	download	the	base	image	and	then	all	of	our	application dependencies.  Let's	check	the	created	image:  $	docker	images REPOSITORY	TAG	IMAGE	ID	CREATED	SIZE cookbook	latest	c79810f58878	About	an	hour	ago	1.05GB  4.	 Next,	run	this	image	to	create	a	container:   $	docker	run	-d	-p	8000:5000	cookbook:latest 3d4b1fbecade79e562b8deca53ccca269f2cdd2604fe28d6bedbf81c6bbfb69c  Here,	we	have	asked	Docker	to	run	the	container	using	the	commands that	were	specified	in	the	Dockerfile	at	the	bottom.	The	-d	argument	asks Docker	to	run	the	container	in	detached	mode	in	the	background, otherwise	it	will	block	the	control	to	the	current	shell	window.	-p	maps the	port	from	the	host	machine	to	the	Docker	container	port.	This	means that	we	have	asked	Docker	to	map	port	8000	on	the	local	machine	to port	5000	on	the	container.	5000	is	the	port	on	which	Flask	runs	its	apps	by default.	The	last	argument	is	the	name	of	the	container	image,	which	is	a combination	of	REPOSITORY	and	TAG,	as	indicated	by	the	docker images	command.	Alternatively,	you	can	just	provide	the	IMAGE	ID.   How	it	works...  Head	over	to	your	browser	and	open	http:  localhost:8000 	to	see	the	application running.  Now,	run	docker	ps	again	to	see	the	details	of	the	running	container:  $	docker	ps CONTAINER	ID	IMAGE	COMMAND	CREATED	STATUS	PORTS	NAMES 3d4b1fbecade	cookbook:latest	"python	run.py"	29	seconds	ago	Up	27	seconds	0.0.0.0:8000->5000 tcp	romantic_mclaren   See	also  You	can	learn	more	about	Dockerfile	at	https:  docs.docker.com engine referenc e builder .

Orchestrating	containers	with Kubernetes  Docker	containers	are	pretty	easy	and	powerful,	as	we	saw	from	the	previous recipe;	however,	without	a	strong	container	orchestration	system,	managing containers	can	become	pretty	intensive.	Kubernetes	 also	written	as	K8s 	is	an open	source	container	orchestration	system	that	automates	the	management, deployment,	and	scaling	of	containerized	applications.	It	was	originally developed	at	Google	and,	over	the	years,	has	become	the	most	popular	container orchestration	software.	It	is	widely	available	across	all	major	cloud	providers.   Getting	ready  In	this	recipe,	we	will	see	how	we	can	leverage	Kubernetes	to	automate	the deployment	and	scaling	of	our	application	container,	which	we	created	in	the previous	recipe.  Kubernetes	is	packaged	along	with	the	newer	versions	of	the	Docker	Desktop installation,	but	right	now	it	is	only	available	on	Mac.	You	can	always	install another	distributions	of	Kubernetes	if	you	wish.	Refer	to	https:  kubernetes.io docs  setup 	for	more	details.	Minikube	is	a	standard	distribution	that's	provided	by Kubernetes	itself.	It's	quite	popular	and	good	for	getting	started.	For	this	recipe,	I will	use	Minikube,	which	will	allow	a	single	node	Kubernetes	cluster	to	be	run inside	a	VM	on	our	local	machine.  To	install	Minikube,	follow	the	instructions	outlined	on	https:  kubernetes.io docs  tasks tools install-minikube ,	for	your	operating	system.  Kubernetes	is	a	huge	topic	that	spans	multiple	dimensions.	There	are	multiple	books dedicated	just	to	Kubernetes,	and	many	more	are	being	written.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	cover	a very	basic	implementation	of	Kubernetes,	just	to	get	you	acquainted	with	it.   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	understand	how	a	local	Kubernetes	cluster	can	be	created and	used:  1.	 After	Minikube	has	installed,	create	a	Minikube	cluster	on	your	local  machine:  $	minikube	start 		minikube	v1.1.0	on	darwin	 amd64  		Downloading	Minikube	ISO	... 		131.28	MB	 	131.28	MB	 	[============================================]	100.00%	0s 		Creating	virtualbox	VM	 CPUs=2,	Memory=2048MB,	Disk=20000MB 	... 		Configuring	environment	for	Kubernetes	v1.14.2	on	Docker	18.09.6 		Downloading	kubelet	v1.14.2 		Downloading	kubeadm	v1.14.2 		Pulling	images	... 		Launching	Kubernetes	... 		Verifying:	apiserver	proxy	etcd	scheduler	controller	dns 		Done!	kubectl	is	now	configured	to	use	"minikube"  It	will	download	the	Minikube	ISO,	which	is	run	using	the	Hypervisor software	that	you	installed	while	installing	Minikube.	After	creating	a VM	using	the	ISO,	Kubernetes	will	be	launched.	This	process	might	take a	bit	of	time	when	it's	run	for	the	first	time.  Minikube	provides	a	browser	dashboard	view	as	well.	This	can	be initiated	by	running	the	following	command:  $	minikube	dashboard 		Enabling	dashboard	... 		Verifying	dashboard	health	... 		Launching	proxy	... 		Verifying	proxy	health	... 		Opening	http:  127.0.0.1:65151 api v1 namespaces kube-system services http:kubernetes-dashboard: proxy 	in	your	default	browser...  Visit	the	URL	mentioned	in	the	output	of	the	preceding	command	to view	the	dashboard.  In	Kubernetes,	containers	are	deployed	in	pods,	where	a	pod	can	be defined	as	a	group	of	one	or	more	containers	that	are	tied	together	for administration	and	networking.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	have	only	one container	inside	a	pod.   2.	 Whenever	a	deployment	is	created	using	Minikube,	it	will	look	for	the Docker	image	on	some	cloud-based	registries	such	as	Docker	Hub	or Google	Cloud	Registry,	or	something	custom.	For	the	purpose	of	this recipe,	we	intend	to	make	a	deployment	using	a	local	Docker	image. Therefore,	we	will	run	the	following	command,	which	sets	the	docker environment	to	minikube	docker:  3.	 Now,	rebuild	the	Docker	image	using	the	preceding	docker	environment	set:  $	eval	$ minikube	docker-env   $	docker	build	-t	cookbook	.  For	more	details	on	building	Docker	images,	refer	to	the	previous	recipe.  4.	 Next,	create	the	deployment	by	running	the	following	command:  $	kubectl	run	cookbook-recipe	--image=cookbook:latest	--image-pull-policy=Never deployment.apps cookbook-recipe	created  To	get	the	status	of	the	newly	created	deployment,	run	the	following command:  $	kubectl	get	deployments NAME	READY	UP-TO-DATE	AVAILABLE	AGE cookbook-recipe	1 1	1	1	5s  Check	the	values	for	the	READY,	UP-TO-DATE,	and	AVAILABLE	columns.	These values	represent	the	number	of	replicas	of	our	application	in	the	cluster.  5.	 Our	application	is	now	running,	but	is	currently	not	accessible	outside	the cluster.	To	expose	the	application	outside	the	Kubernetes	cluster,	create	a LoadBalancer	type	service:  $	kubectl	expose	deployment	cookbook-recipe	--type=LoadBalancer	--port=5000 service cookbook-recipe	exposed  Previously,	just	the	deployment	was	exposed,	whereas,	here,	the	cluster's internal	port,	5000,	will	be	exposed	to	a	random	port	on	the	public	IP.   How	it	works...  To	open	the	application	in	a	browser,	run	the	following	command:  $	minikube	service	cookbook-recipe 		Opening	kubernetes	service	default cookbook-recipe	in	default	browser...  Running	the	preceding	command	will	open	the	application	in	a	browser	on	a random	port,	such	as	32404.  Scaling	a	deployment	is	very	easy	with	Kubernetes.	It	is	as	simple	as	running	a single	command.	By	doing	this,	the	application	will	be	replicated	in	multiple pods:  $	kubectl	scale	--replicas=3	deployment cookbook-recipe deployment.extensions cookbook-recipe	scaled  Now,	look	at	the	status	of	deployment	again:  $	kubectl	get	deployments NAME	READY	UP-TO-DATE	AVAILABLE	AGE cookbook-recipe	3 3	3	3	23m  Check	the	replica	values	in	the	READY,	UP-TO-DATE,	and	AVAILABLE	columns,	which	will have	increased	from	1	to	3.   There's	more...  You	can	look	at	the	YAML	configurations	that	Kubernetes	automatically	creates for	the	deployment	and	service:  $	kubectl	get	service	cookbook-recipe	-o	yaml apiVersion:	v1 kind:	Service metadata: 	creationTimestamp:	"2019-05-24T17:20:10Z" 	labels: 	run:	cookbook-recipe 	name:	cookbook-recipe 	namespace:	default 	resourceVersion:	"7829" 	selfLink:	 api v1 namespaces default services cookbook-recipe 	uid:	2f3c26c4-7e48-11e9-b1ea-080027d87cc5 spec: 	clusterIP:	10.96.207.154 	externalTrafficPolicy:	Cluster 	ports: 	-	nodePort:	32402 	port:	5000 	protocol:	TCP 	targetPort:	5000 	selector: 	run:	cookbook-recipe 	sessionAffinity:	None 	type:	LoadBalancer status: 	loadBalancer:	{}  The	preceding	code	is	the	config	for	service.	In	a	similar	fashion,	the	config	for deployment	can	also	be	fetched:  $	kubectl	get	deployment	cookbook-recipe	-o	yaml  What	I	have	shown	in	this	recipe	is	a	very	basic	implementation	of	Kubernetes.	The	purpose of	this	is	to	get	you	acquainted	with	Kubernetes.	This	recipe	does	not	intend	to	be	a production-grade	implementation.	Ideally,	the	config	files	need	to	be	created,	and	then	the overall	Kubernetes	deployment	can	be	built	around	them.	I	would	urge	you	to	build	on	the knowledge	from	this	recipe	and	strive	toward	production-grade	techniques	with	Kubernetes.

Going	serverless	with	Zappa	on	AWS Lambda  Serverless	computing	is	a	cloud	computing	model	where	the	cloud	provider	runs the	server	and	dynamically	manages	the	allocation	of	machine	resources	by scaling	the	resources	up	or	down,	depending	on	the	consumption.	Pricing	is	done based	on	the	actual	resources	that	are	used.	It	also	simplifies	the	overall	process of	deploying	code,	and	it	becomes	relatively	easy	to	maintain	different executions	for	different	environments	such	as	development,	testing,	staging,	and production.	These	properties	of	serverless	computing	make	this	model	a	perfect candidate	for	developing	and	deploying	tons	of	microservices	without	worrying about	managing	the	overhead.  Lambda	is	AWS's	service	for	the	serverless	computing	model.	In	this	recipe,	we will	see	how	to	deploy	a	simple	Flask	application	with	Lambda	using	a	popular package	named	Zappa.  The	serverless	computing	model	is	best	suited	for	deploying	APIs	instead	of	applications, which	can	serve	static	content.	Although	it	is	possible	to	do	this,	it	isn't	advisable.   Getting	ready  In	this	recipe,	we	will	use	the	application	from	Chapter	1,	Flask	Configurations. The	reason	for	this	is	that	Lambda	is	not	meant	to	deploy	applications	that	serve static	content.  First,	we	start	by	installing	Zappa:  	$	pip3	install	zappa   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	understand	how	to	use	Zappa	with	AWS:  1.	 Create	a	Zappa	settings	file,	which	will	be	used	by	Zappa	to	deploy	the  service:  $	zappa	init  ███████╗	█████╗	██████╗	██████╗	█████╗ ╚══███╔╝██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗ 		███╔╝	███████║██████╔╝██████╔╝███████║ 	███╔╝	██╔══██║██╔═══╝	██╔═══╝	██╔══██║ ███████╗██║	██║██║	██║	██║	██║ ╚══════╝╚═╝	╚═╝╚═╝	╚═╝	╚═╝	╚═╝  Welcome	to	Zappa!  Zappa	is	a	system	for	running	server-less	Python	web	applications	on	AWS	Lambda	and	AWS	API	Gateway. This	`init`	command	will	help	you	create	and	configure	your	new	Zappa	deployment. Let's	get	started!  Your	Zappa	configuration	can	support	multiple	production	stages,	like	'dev',	'staging',	and	'production'. What	do	you	want	to	call	this	environment	 default	'dev' :  AWS	Lambda	and	API	Gateway	are	only	available	in	certain	regions.	Let's	check	to	make	sure	you	have	a	profile	set	up	in	one	that	will	work. We	found	the	following	profiles:	default.	Which	would	you	like	us	to	use?	 default	'default' :	default  Your	Zappa	deployments	will	need	to	be	uploaded	to	a	private	S3	bucket. If	you	don't	have	a	bucket	yet,	we'll	create	one	for	you	too. What	do	you	want	to	call	your	bucket?	 default	'zappa-chupnt4b0' :  It	looks	like	this	is	a	Flask	application. What's	the	modular	path	to	your	app's	function? This	will	likely	be	something	like	'your_module.app'. We	discovered:	my_app.__init__.app,	build.lib.my_app.__init__.app Where	is	your	app's	function?	 default	'my_app.__init__.app' :	my_app.__init__.app  You	can	optionally	deploy	to	all	available	regions	in	order	to	provide	fast	global	service. If	you	are	using	Zappa	for	the	first	time,	you	probably	don't	want	to	do	this! Would	you	like	to	deploy	this	application	globally?	 default	'n' 	[y n  p rimary]:  Okay,	here's	your	zappa_settings.json:  { 				"dev":	{ 								"app_function":	"my_app.__init__.app", 								"aws_region":	"ap-south-1", 								"profile_name":	"default", 								"project_name":	"chapter-13", 								"runtime":	"python3.6", 								"s3_bucket":	"zappa-chupnt4b0" 				} }  Does	this	look	okay?	 default	'y' 	[y n]:   Done!	Now	you	can	deploy	your	Zappa	application	by	executing:  After	that,	you	can	update	your	application	code	with:  		$	zappa	deploy	dev  		$	zappa	update	dev  Enjoy!, 	~	Team	Zappa!  To	learn	more,	check	out	our	project	page	on	GitHub	here:	https:  github.com Miserlou Zappa and	stop	by	our	Slack	channel	here:	https:  slack.zappa.io  Running	the	preceding	command	will	prompt	you	to	answer	a	number	of questions	that	will	eventually	lead	to	the	creation	of	a	zappa_settings.json file.	You	can	always	edit	this	file	after	creation	to	suit	your	requirements. Alternatively,	the	zappa	init	step	can	be	skipped	completely	if	you	already know	how	to	write	a	zappa_settings.json	file.  The	zappa_settings.json	file	will	look	as	follows:  { 				"dev":	{ 								"app_function":	"my_app.__init__.app", 								"aws_region":	"ap-south-1", 								"profile_name":	"default", 								"project_name":	"chapter-13", 								"runtime":	"python3.6", 								"s3_bucket":	"zappa-chupnt4b0" 				} }  Here,	some	important	values	to	note	are	app_function,	which	refers	to	the Flask	application	object,	and	s3_bucket,	which	is	created	by	Zappa	by default	to	upload	the	code	that	will	eventually	be	picked	up	by	AWS Lambda.	The	rest	of	the	settings	are	AWS-specific	and	should	be	updated as	per	your	local	AWS	settings.  2.	 Next,	deploy	the	application	to	AWS	Lambda:  $	zappa	deploy	dev Calling	deploy	for	stage	dev.. Creating	chapter-13-dev-ZappaLambdaExecutionRole	IAM	Role.. Creating	zappa-permissions	policy	on	chapter-13-dev-ZappaLambdaExecutionRole	IAM	Role. Downloading	and	installing	dependencies.. ..... ..... ..... Deploying	API	Gateway.. Deployment	complete!:	https:   .execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com dev   Running	zappa	deploy	automatically	creates	a	Lambda	function	on	AWS and	an	API	Gateway	to	serve	the	Lambda	function.  Zappa	has	a	multitude	of	settings	that	are	often	needed	when	you	want	to	customize	your deployment.	Refer	to	https:  github.com Miserlou Zappaadvanced-settings	for	details.  3.	 Whenever	a	change	is	made	to	the	application	and	needs	to	be	deployed,  run	the	following	command:  $	zappa	update	dev   How	it	works...  Head	over	to	the	URL	that	was	generated	when	the	$	zappa	deploy	dev	command was	run	and	open	this	URL	in	a	browser.	The	application	should	open	up	on	this URL	and	all	the	other	endpoints	should	work	as	intended.	To	see	how	this application	will	work,	refer	to	Chapter	1,	Flask	Configurations.   See	also  Zappa	development	is	done	at	https:  github.com Miserlou Zappa. You	can	read	about	serverless	computing	at	https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Serve rless_computing. The	AWS	Lambda	documentation	and	pricing	can	be	found	at	https:  aws.am azon.com lambda . The	AWS	API	Gateway	documentation	and	pricing	can	be	found	at	https:   aws.amazon.com api-gateway .   Other	Tips	and	Tricks  This	book	has	covered	almost	all	the	areas	that	need	to	be	known	for	the	creation of	a	web	application	using	Flask.	Much	has	been	covered,	and	a	lot	more	needs to	be	explored.	In	this	final	chapter,	we	will	go	through	some	additional	recipes that	can	be	used	to	add	value	to	the	application	if	needed.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	learn	how	to	implement	full-text	search	using	Whoosh and	Elasticsearch.	Full-text	search	becomes	important	for	a	web	application	that offers	a	lot	of	content	and	options,	such	as	an	e-commerce	site.	Next,	we	will catch	up	on	signals	that	help	decouple	applications	by	sending	notifications  signals 	when	an	action	is	performed	somewhere	in	the	application.	This	action is	caught	by	a	subscriber receiver,	which	can	perform	an	action	accordingly. This	is	followed	by	implementing	caching	for	our	Flask	application.  We	will	also	see	how	email	support	is	added	to	our	application	and	how	emails can	be	sent	directly	from	the	application	by	performing	different	actions.	We will	then	see	how	we	can	make	our	application	asynchronous.	By	default,	WSGI applications	are	synchronous	and	blocking;	that	is,	by	default,	they	do	not	serve multiple	simultaneous	requests	together.	We	will	see	how	to	deal	with	this	via	a small	example.	We	will	also	integrate	Celery	with	our	application	and	see	how	a task	queue	can	be	used	to	our	application's	benefit.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	recipes:  Implementing	full-text	search	with	Whoosh Implementing	full-text	search	with	Elasticsearch Working	with	signals Using	caching	with	your	application Implementing	email	support	for	Flask	applications Understanding	asynchronous	operations Working	with	Celery   Implementing	full-text	search	with Whoosh  Whoosh	is	a	fast,	featureful,	full-text	indexing	and	searching	library	that's implemented	in	Python.	It	has	a	pure	Pythonic	API	and	allows	developers	to	add search	functionality	to	their	applications	easily	and	efficiently.	In	this	recipe,	we will	use	a	package	called	Flask-WhooshAlchemy,	which	integrates	the	text- search	functionality	of	Whoosh	with	SQLAlchemy	for	use	in	Flask	applications.   Getting	ready  The	Flask-WhooshAlchemy	package	can	be	installed	via	pip	using	the	following command:  	$	pip3	install	git+git:  github.com gyllstromk Flask-WhooshAlchemy.git  This	will	install	the	required	packages	and	dependencies.	This	library	is	being cloned	and	installed	from	GitHub	because	it	isn't	highly	maintained,	and	so	the release	on	PyPI	is	not	in	sync	with	the	GitHub	repository.	A	suggested	way	of implementing	Whoosh	with	the	Flask	application	would	be	to	use	the	Whoosh library	directly	from	https:  whoosh.readthedocs.io en latest intro.html.   How	to	do	it...  Integrating	Whoosh	with	Flask	using	SQLAlchemy	is	pretty	straightforward. Let's	take	a	look:  1.	 First,	provide	the	path	to	the	Whoosh	base	directory	where	the	index	for	our  models	will	be	created.	This	should	be	done	in	the	application's configuration,	that	is,	my_app __init__.py:  app.config['WHOOSH_BASE']	=	' tmp whoosh'	  You	can	choose	any	path	you	prefer,	and	it	can	be	absolute	or	relative.  2.	 Next,	make	small	changes	to	the	my_app catalog models.py	file	to	make	the  string text	fields	searchable:  import	flask_whooshalchemy	 from	my_app	import	app	 	 class	Product db.Model :	 				__searchable__	=	['name',	'company']	 					...	Rest	of	code	as	before	...			 	 class	Category db.Model :	 				__searchable__	=	['name']	 					...	Rest	of	code	as	before	...			  Notice	the	__searchable__	statement	that	has	been	added	to	both	models.	It tells	Whoosh	to	create	an	index	on	these	fields.	Remember	that	these fields	should	only	be	of	the	text	or	string	type.  3.	 After	this	is	done,	add	a	new	handler	to	search	using	Whoosh.	This	is	to	be  done	in	my_app catalog views.py:  @catalog.route ' product-search-whoosh' 	 @catalog.route ' product-search-whoosh  ' 	 def	product_search_whoosh page=1 :	 				q	=	request.args.get 'q' 	 				products	=	Product.query.whoosh_search q 	 				return	render_template 	 								'products.html',	products=products.paginate page,	10 	 				 	  Here,	we	got	the	URL	argument	with	the	key	as	q	and	passed	its	value	to   the	whoosh_search  	method,	which	does	the	full-text	search	in	the	Product model	on	the	name	and	company	fields,	which	we	made	searchable	in	the models	earlier.   How	it	works...  Those	who	have	gone	through	the	Implementing	SQL-based	searching	recipe	in	 Chapter	4,	Working	with	Views,	will	recall	that	we	implemented	a	method	that performed	a	search	on	the	basis	of	fields.	However,	here,	in	the	case	of	Whoosh, we	don't	need	to	specify	any	field	while	searching.	We	can	type	in	any	text,	and if	this	matches	the	searchable	fields,	the	results	will	be	shown,	ordered	in	the rank	of	their	relevance.  First,	create	some	products	in	the	application.	Now,	if	we	open http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product-search-whoosh?q=iPhone,	the	resulting	page	will	list	all	the products	that	have	iPhone	in	their	names.  There	are	advanced	options	that	are	provided	by	Whoosh	where	we	can	control	which	fields need	to	be	searched	for	or	how	the	result	has	to	be	ordered.	You	can	explore	them	as	per	the needs	of	your	application.   See	also  You	can	read	about	Whoosh	at	https:  pythonhosted.org Whoosh . You	can	read	about	the	Flask	extension	for	Whoosh	at	https:  pypi.python.org  pypi Flask-WhooshAlchemy.   Implementing	full-text	search	with Elasticsearch Elasticsearch	is	a	search	server	based	on	Lucene,	which	is	an	open	source information-retrieval	library.	Elasticsearch	provides	a	distributed	full-text	search engine	with	a	RESTful	web	interface	and	schema-free	JSON	documents.	In	this recipe,	we	will	implement	full-text	search	using	Elasticsearch	for	our	Flask application.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	a	Python	library	called	elasticsearch,	which	makes	dealing	with Elasticsearch	a	lot	easier:  $	pip3	install	elasticsearch	  We	also	need	to	install	the	Elasticsearch	server	itself.	This	can	be	downloaded from	https:  www.elastic.co downloads elasticsearch.	Unpack	the	package	and	run	the following	command:  $	bin elasticsearch	  This	will	start	the	Elasticsearch	server	on	http:  localhost:9200 	by	default.   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	perform	the	integration	between	Elasticsearch	and	our Flask	application:  1.	 Start	by	adding	the	Elasticsearch	object	to	the	application's	configuration,  that	is,	my_app __init__.py:  from	elasticsearch	import	Elasticsearch	 	 es	=	Elasticsearch 'http:  localhost:9200 '  es.indices.create 'catalog',	ignore=400 	  Here,	we	created	an	es	object	from	the	Elasticsearch	class,	which	accepts the	server	URL.	ignore=400	will	ignore	any	errors	that	are	raised	since	this index	has	been	created	already.  2.	 Next,	we	need	to	add	a	document	to	our	Elasticsearch	index.	This	can	be done	in	views	or	models;	however,	in	my	opinion,	the	best	way	will	be	to add	it	in	the	model	layer.	We	will	do	this	in	the	my_app catalog models.py	file:  from	my_app	import	es	 	 class	Product db.Model :	 	 				def	add_index_to_es self :	 								es.index index='catalog',	body={	 												'name':	self.name,	 												'category':	self.category.name	 								},	id=self.id 	 								es.indices.refresh index='catalog' 	 	 class	Category db.Model :	 	 				def	add_index_to_es self :	 								es.index index='catalog',	body={	 												'name':	self.name,	 								},	id=self.id 	 								es.indices.refresh index='catalog' 	  Here,	in	each	of	the	models,	we	added	a	new	method	called add_index_to_es  ,	which	will	add	the	document	that	corresponds	to	the current	Product	or	Category	object	to	the	catalog	index.	You	might	want	to index	different	types	of	data	in	separate	models	to	make	the	search	more accurate.	Finally,	we	refreshed	our	index	so	that	the	newly	created	index   is	available	for	searching.  The	add_index_to_es  	method	can	be	called	when	we	create,	update,	or delete	a	product	or	category.  3.	 For	demonstration	purposes,	just	add	the	following	method	while	creating  the	product	in	my_app catalog views.py:  from	my_app	import	es	 	 def	create_product  :	 				...	normal	product	creation	as	always	...	 				db.session.commit  	 				product.add_index_to_es  	 				...	normal	process	as	always	...	 	 @catalog.route ' product-search-es' 	 @catalog.route ' product-search-es  ' 	 def	product_search_es page=1 :	 				q	=	request.args.get 'q' 	 				products	=	es.search index="catalog",	body={ 								"query":	{ 												"query_string":	{ 																"query":	q 												} 								} 				} 	 				return	products	  We	also	added	a	product_search_es  	method	to	allow	for	searching	on	the Elasticsearch	index	we	just	created.	Do	the	same	in	the	create_category   method	as	well.  The	search	query	we	sent	in	the	preceding	code	to	Elasticsearch	is	pretty	basic	and	open- ended.	I	would	urge	you	to	read	about	Elasticsearch	query	building	and	apply	it	to	your program.   How	it	works...  Now,	let's	say	we	created	a	few	categories	and	products	in	each	of	the	categories. If	we	open	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product-search-es?q=galaxy,	we	will	get	a	response similar	to	the	following:  I	encourage	you	to	try	and	enhance	the	formatting	and	display	of	the	page.   Working	with	signals Signals	can	be	thought	of	as	events	that	happen	in	our	application.	These	events can	be	subscribed	by	certain	receivers	who	then	invoke	a	function	whenever	the event	occurs.	The	occurrence	of	events	is	broadcasted	by	senders	who	can specify	the	arguments	that	can	be	used	by	the	function,	which	will	be	triggered by	the	receiver.  You	should	refrain	from	modifying	any	application	data	in	the	signals	because	signals	aren't executed	in	a	specified	order	and	can	easily	lead	to	data	corruption.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	a	Python	library	called	blinker	that	provides	the	signals	feature.	Flask has	built-in	support	for	blinker	and	uses	signaling	itself	to	a	good	extent.	There are	certain	core	signals	provided	by	Flask.  In	this	recipe,	we	will	use	the	application	from	the	Implementing	full-text	search with	Elasticsearch	recipe	and	add	the	product	and	category	documents	to	make indexes	work	via	signals.   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	understand	how	signaling	works:  1.	 First,	create	signals	for	the	product	and	category	creation.	This	can	be	done in	my_app catalog models.py.	This	can	be	done	in	any	file	we	want	since	signals are	created	on	a	global	scope:  from	blinker	import	Namespace	 	 catalog_signals	=	Namespace  	 product_created	=	catalog_signals.signal 'product-created' 	 category_created	=	catalog_signals.signal 'category-created' 	  We	will	use	Namespace	to	create	signals,	which	will	create	them	in	a	custom namespace	rather	than	in	the	global	namespace,	thereby	helping	with	the clean	management	of	signals.	We	created	two	signals,	where	the	intent	of both	is	clear	by	their	names.  2.	 Then,	we	will	create	subscribers	to	these	signals	and	attach	functions	to  them.	For	this,	the	add_index_to_es  	methods	have	to	be	removed,	and	new functions	on	the	global	scope	have	to	be	created	in	my_app catalog models.py:  def	add_product_index_to_es sender,	product :	 				es.index index='catalog',	body={	 								'name':	product.name,	 								'category':	product.category.name	 				},	id=product.id 	 				es.indices.refresh index='catalog' 	 	 product_created.connect add_product_index_to_es,	app 	 	 def	add_category_index_to_es sender,	category :	 				es.index index='catalog',	body={	 								'name':	category.name,	 				},	id=category.id 	 				es.indices.refresh index='catalog' 	 	 category_created.connect add_category_index_to_es,	app 	  In	the	preceding	code	snippet,	we	created	subscribers	for	the	signals	we created	previously	using	.connect  .	This	method	accepts	the	function	that should	be	called	when	the	event	occurs;	it	also	accepts	the	sender	as	an optional	argument.	The	app	object	is	provided	as	the	sender	because	we don't	want	our	function	to	be	called	every	time	the	event	is	triggered   anywhere	in	any	application.	This	specifically	holds	true	in	the	case	of extensions,	which	can	be	used	by	multiple	applications.	The	function	that gets	called	by	the	receiver	gets	the	sender	as	the	first	argument,	which defaults	to	none	if	the	sender	is	not	provided.	We	provided	the product category	as	the	second	argument	for	which	the	record	needs	to be	added	to	the	Elasticsearch	index.  3.	 Now,	emit	the	signal	that	can	be	caught	by	the	receiver.	This	needs	to	be  done	in	my_app catalog views.py.	For	this,	just	remove	the	calls	to	the add_index_to_es  	methods	and	replace	them	with	the	.send  	methods:  from	my_app.catalog.models	import	product_created,	category_created	 	 def	create_product  :	 				...	normal	product	creation	as	always	...	 				db.session.commit  	 				product_created.send app,	product=product 	 					product.add_index_to_es  	 				...	normal	process	as	always	...	  Do	the	same	in	the	create_category  	method	as	well.   How	it	works...  Whenever	a	product	is	created,	the	product_created	signal	is	emitted,	with	the	app object	as	the	sender	and	the	product	as	the	keyword	argument.	This	is	then caught	in	models.py	and	the	add_product_index_to_es  	function	is	called,	which	adds the	document	to	the	catalog	index.   See	also  Read	the	Implementing	full-text	search	with	Elasticsearch	recipe	for	a background	on	this	recipe. You	can	read	about	the	blinker	library	at	https:  pypi.python.org pypi blinker. You	can	view	the	list	of	core	signals	that	are	supported	by	Flask	at	http:  fla sk.pocoo.org docs 1.0 api core-signals-list. You	can	view	the	signals	that	are	provided	by	Flask-SQLAlchemy	at	https:   flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com en 2.x signals .   Using	caching	with	your	application  Caching	becomes	an	important	and	integral	part	of	any	web	application	when scaling	or	increasing	the	response	time	of	your	application	becomes	a	question. Caching	is	the	first	thing	that	is	implemented	in	these	cases.	Flask,	by	itself,	does not	provide	any	caching	support	by	default,	but	Werkzeug	does.	Werkzeug	has some	basic	support	to	cache	with	multiple	backends,	such	as	Memcached	and Redis.   Getting	ready  We	will	install	a	Flask	extension	called	flask-caching,	which	simplifies	the	process of	caching	a	lot:  $	pip3	install	flask-caching  We	will	use	our	catalog	application	for	this	purpose	and	implement	caching	for some	methods.   How	to	do	it...  Implementing	basic	caching	is	pretty	easy.	Follow	these	steps	to	do	so:  1.	 First,	initialize	Cache	to	work	with	our	application.	This	is	done	in	the  application's	configuration,	that	is,	my_app __init__.py:  from	flask_caching	import	Cache	 	 cache	=	Cache app,	config={'CACHE_TYPE':	'simple'} 	  Here,	we	used	simple	as	the	Cache	type,	where	the	cache	is	stored	in	the memory.	This	is	not	advised	for	production	environments.	For production,	we	should	use	something	such	as	Redis,	Memcached, filesystem	cache,	and	so	on.	Flask-Cache	supports	all	of	them	with	a couple	of	more	backends.  2.	 Next,	add	caching	to	the	methods	that	need	to	be	cached.	Just	add	a  @cache.cached timeout=  	decorator	to	the	view	methods.	A simple	target	can	be	the	list	of	categories	 we	will	do	this	in my_app catalog views.py :  from	my_app	import	cache	 	 @catalog.route ' categories' 	 @cache.cached timeout=120 	 def	categories  :	 					Fetch	and	display	the	list	of	categories	  This	way	of	caching	stores	the	value	of	the	output	of	this	method	in	the cache	in	the	form	of	a	key-value	pair,	with	the	key	as	the	request	path.   How	it	works...  After	adding	the	preceding	code,	to	check	whether	the	cache	works	as	expected, fetch	the	list	of	categories	by	pointing	the	browser	to http:  127.0.0.1:5000 categories.	This	will	save	a	key-value	pair	for	this	URL	in	the cache.	Now,	create	a	new	category	quickly	and	navigate	to	the	same	category	list page.	You	will	notice	that	the	newly	added	category	is	not	listed.	Wait	for	a couple	of	minutes	and	then	reload	the	page.	The	newly	added	category	will	be shown	now.	This	is	because	the	first	time	the	category	list	was	cached,	it	expired after	2	minutes,	that	is,	120	seconds.  This	might	seem	to	be	a	fault	with	the	application,	but	in	the	case	of	large applications,	this	becomes	a	boon	where	the	hits	to	the	database	are	reduced,	and the	overall	application	experience	improves.	Caching	is	usually	implemented	for those	handlers	whose	results	don't	get	updated	frequently.   There's	more...  Many	of	us	might	think	that	such	caching	will	fail	in	the	case	of	a	single category	or	product	page,	where	each	record	has	a	separate	page.	The	solution	to this	is	memoization.	It	is	similar	to	caching,	with	the	difference	being	that	it stores	the	result	of	a	method	in	the	cache,	along	with	the	information	on	the parameters	that	were	passed.	So,	when	a	method	is	created	with	the	same parameters	multiple	times,	the	result	is	loaded	from	the	cache	rather	than	making a	database	hit.	Implementing	memoization	is	quite	simple:  @catalog.route ' product  ' 	 @cache.memoize 120 	 def	product id :	 					Fetch	and	display	the	product	  Now,	if	we	call	a	URL,	say,	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product 1,	in	our	browser	for	the first	time,	it	will	be	loaded	after	making	calls	to	the	database.	However,	if	we make	the	same	call	again,	the	page	will	be	loaded	from	the	cache.	On	the	other hand,	if	we	open	another	product,	say,	http:  127.0.0.1:5000 product 2,	then	it	will be	loaded	after	fetching	the	product	details	from	the	database.   See	also  Flask-Caching	at	https:  flask-caching.readthedocs.io en latest . Memoization	at	http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Memoization.   Implementing	email	support	for Flask	applications  The	ability	to	send	emails	is	usually	one	of	the	most	basic	functions	of	any	web application.	It	is	usually	easy	to	implement	with	any	application.	With	Python- based	applications,	it	is	quite	simple	to	implement	with	the	help	of	smtplib.	In	the case	of	Flask,	this	is	further	simplified	by	an	extension	called	Flask-Mail.   Getting	ready  Flask-Mail	can	be	easily	installed	via	pip:  $	pip3	install	Flask-Mail	  Let's	look	at	a	simple	case	where	an	email	will	be	sent	to	a	catalog	manager	in the	application	whenever	a	new	category	is	added.   How	to	do	it...  First,	instantiate	the	Mail	object	in	our	application's	configuration,	that	is, my_app __init__.py:  from	flask_mail	import	Mail	 	 app.config['MAIL_SERVER']	=	'smtp.gmail.com'	 app.config['MAIL_PORT']	=	587	 app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS']	=	True	 app.config['MAIL_USERNAME']	=	'gmail_username'	 app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD']	=	'gmail_password'	 app.config['MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER']	=	 'Sender	name',	'sender	email' 	 mail	=	Mail app 	  We	also	need	to	do	some	configuration	to	set	up	the	email	server	and	sender account.	The	preceding	code	is	a	sample	configuration	for	Gmail	accounts.	Any SMTP	server	can	be	set	up	like	this.	There	are	several	other	options	provided; they	can	be	found	in	the	Flask-Mail	documentation	at	https:  pythonhosted.org Flask -Mail.   How	it	works...  To	send	an	email	on	category	creation,	we	need	to	make	the	following	changes in	my_app catalog views.py:  from	my_app	import	mail	 from	flask_mail	import	Message	 	 @catalog.route ' category-create',	methods=['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	create_category  :	 					...	Create	category	...		 				db.session.commit  	 				message	=	Message 	 								"New	category	added",	 								recipients=['some-receiver@domain.com']	 				 	 				message.body	=	'New	category	"%s"	has	been	created'	%	 							category.name	 				mail.send message 	 					...	Rest	of	the	process	...		  Here,	a	new	email	will	be	sent	to	the	list	of	recipients	from	the	default	sender configuration	that	we	did.   There's	more...  Now,	let's	assume	that	we	need	to	send	a	large	email	with	a	lot	of	HTML content.	Writing	all	of	this	in	our	Python	file	will	make	the	overall	code	ugly	and unmanageable.	A	simple	solution	to	this	is	to	create	templates	and	render	their content	while	sending	emails.	Here,	I	created	two	templates:	one	for	the	HTML content	and	one	simply	for	text	content.  The	category-create-email-text.html	template	will	look	like	this:  A	new	category	has	been	added	to	the	catalog.	 	 The	name	of	the	category	is	{{	category.name	}}.	 Click	on	the	URL	below	to	access	the	same:	 {{	url_for 'catalog.category',	id=category.id,	_external	=	True 	}}	 	 This	is	an	automated	email.	Do	not	reply	to	it.	  The	category-create-email-html.html	template	will	looks	like	this:   A	new	category	has	been	added	to	the	catalog. 	 		 The	name	of	the	category	is	 	 						 {{	category.name	}} 	 				 .	  	 	  This	is	an	automated	email.	Do	not	reply	to	it. 	  After	this,	we	need	to	modify	our	email	message	creation	procedure	that	we created	earlier:  message.body	=	render_template 	 				"category-create-email-text.html",	 				category=category	  	 message.html	=	render_template 	 				"category-create-email-html.html",	 				category=category	  	   See	also  The	next	recipe,	Understanding	asynchronous	operations,	will	show	us	how	we can	delegate	the	time-consuming	email	sending	process	to	an	asynchronous thread	and	speed	up	our	application	experience.   Understanding	asynchronous operations  Some	of	the	operations	in	a	web	application	can	be	time-consuming	and	make the	overall	application	feel	slow	for	the	user,	even	though	it's	not	actually	slow. This	hampers	the	user	experience	significantly.	To	deal	with	this,	the	simplest way	to	implement	the	asynchronous	execution	of	operations	is	with	the	help	of threads.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	implement	this	using	the	threading	libraries	of Python.	In	Python	3,	the	thread	package	has	been	deprecated.	Although	it	is	still available	as	_thread,	it	is	highly	recommended	to	use	threading.   Getting	ready  We	will	use	the	application	from	the	Implementing	email	support	for	Flask applications	recipe.	Many	of	us	will	have	noticed	that,	while	the	email	is	being sent,	the	application	waits	for	the	whole	process	to	finish,	which	is	unnecessary. Email	sending	can	be	easily	done	in	the	background,	and	our	application	can become	available	to	the	user	instantaneously.   How	to	do	it...  Doing	an	asynchronous	execution	with	the	threading	package	is	very	simple.	Just add	the	following	code	to	my_app catalog views.py:  from	threading	import	Thread	 	 def	send_mail message :	 				with	app.app_context  :	 								mail.send message 	 	 	Replace	the	line	below	in	create_category  	 	mail.send message 	 	by	 t	=	Thread target=send_mail,	args= message,   t.start    As	you	can	see,	the	sending	of	an	email	happens	in	a	new	thread,	which	sends the	message	as	a	parameter	to	the	newly	created	method.	We	need	to	create	a new	send_mail  	method	because	our	email	templates	contain	url_for,	which	can only	be	executed	inside	an	application	context;	this	won't	be	available	in	the newly	created	thread	by	default.	It	provides	the	flexibility	of	starting	the	thread whenever	it's	needed	instead	of	creating	and	starting	the	thread	at	the	same	time.   How	it	works...  It	is	pretty	simple	to	observe	how	this	works.	Compare	the	performance	of	this type	of	execution	with	the	application	in	the	previous	recipe,	Implementing	email support	for	Flask	applications.	You	will	notice	that	the	application	is	more responsive.	Another	way	can	be	to	monitor	the	debug	logs,	where	the	newly created	category	page	will	load	before	the	email	is	sent.   Working	with	Celery  Celery	is	a	task	queue	for	Python.	There	used	to	be	an	extension	to	integrate Flask	and	Celery,	but	with	Celery	3.0,	it	became	obsolete.	Now,	Celery	can	be directly	used	with	Flask	by	just	using	a	bit	of	configuration.	In	the Understanding	asynchronous	operations	recipe,	we	implemented	asynchronous processing	to	send	an	email.	In	this	recipe,	we	will	implement	the	same	using Celery.   Getting	ready  Celery	can	be	installed	simply	from	PyPI:  $	pip	install	celery	  To	make	Celery	work	with	Flask,	we	will	need	to	modify	our	Flask	app	config file	a	bit.	Here,	we	will	use	Redis	as	the	broker	 thanks	to	its	simplicity .	  Make	sure	that	you	run	the	Redis	server	for	the	connection	to	happen.	To	install	and	run a	Redis	server,	refer	to	http:  redis.io topics quickstart.  We	will	use	the	application	from	the	previous	recipe	and	implement	Celery	in the	same	manner.   How	to	do	it...  Follow	these	steps	to	understand	Celery's	integration	with	the	Flask	application:  1.	 First,	we	need	to	do	a	bit	of	configuration	in	the	application's	configuration,  that	is,	my_app __init__.py:  from	celery	import	Celery	 	 app.config.update 	 				CELERY_BROKER_URL='redis:  localhost:6379',	 				CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND='redis:  localhost:6379'	  	 	 def	make_celery app :	 				celery	=	Celery 	 								app.import_name,	broker=app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL']	 				 	 				celery.conf.update app.config 	 				TaskBase	=	celery.Task	 				class	ContextTask TaskBase :	 								abstract	=	True	 								def	__call__ self,	*args,	**kwargs :	 												with	app.app_context  :	 																return	TaskBase.__call__ self,	*args,	**kwargs 	 				celery.Task	=	ContextTask	 				return	celery	  The	preceding	snippet	comes	directly	from	the	Flask	website	and	can	be used	as	is	in	your	application	in	most	cases:  celery	=	make_celery app 	  2.	 To	run	the	Celery	process,	execute	the	following	command:  $	celery	worker	-b	redis:  localhost:6379	--app=my_app.celery	-l	INFO	  Make	sure	that	Redis	is	also	running	on	the	broker	URL,	as	specified	in	the	configuration.  Here,	-b	points	to	the	broker,	while	-app	points	to	the	celery	object	that	is created	in	the	configuration	file.  3.	 Now,	use	this	celery	object	in	the	my_app catalog views.py	file	to	send	emails  asynchronously:  from	my_app	import	celery	 	 @celery.task  	   @celery.task  	 def	send_mail message :	 				with	app.app_context  :	 								mail.send message 	 	 	Add	this	line	wherever	the	email	needs	to	be	sent	 send_mail.apply_async  message,  	  We	add	the	@celery.task	decorator	to	any	method	that	we	wish	to	use	as	a Celery	task.	The	Celery	process	will	detect	these	methods	automatically.   How	it	works...  Now,	when	we	create	a	category	and	an	email	is	sent,	we	can	see	a	task	being run	on	the	Celery	process	logs,	which	will	look	like	this:  [2014-08-28	01:16:47,365:	INFO MainProcess]	Received	task:	my_app.catalog.views.send_mail[d2ca07ae-6b47-4b76-9935-17b826cdc340] 				[2014-08-28	01:16:55,695:	INFO MainProcess]	Task	my_app.catalog.views.send_mail[d2ca07ae-6b47-4b76-9935-17b826cdc340]	succeeded	in	8.329121886s:	None 		   See	also  Read	the	Understanding	asynchronous	operations	recipe	to	see	how	threads can	be	used	for	various	purposes—in	our	case,	to	send	emails.
