The fundamental purpose of HTML as a markup language is to provide a semantic description  the meaning  of the content and establish a document structure  a hierarchy of elements .  This pocket reference provides a concise yet thorough listing of the elements and attributes specified in the HTML5 Candi- date Recommendation maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  dated December 17, 2012, the HTML 5.1 Editor’s Draft dated June 15, 2013, and the “living” HTML specification maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group  WHATWG  as of June 15, 2013.  Elements  and  attributes  from  the  HTML  4.01  Specification that were made obsolete in HTML5 have been omitted from this edition. The elements and attributes contained in this book may  be  used  in  HTML  4.01,  XHTML  1.0,  or  XHTML  1.1 documents, unless they are explicitly marked “Not in HTML 4.01,” in which case they will cause the document to be invalid.  HTML5  documents  can  be  written  in  XHTML  syntax   for- mally known as the “XML Serialization of HTML5” , so when- ever  applicable,  special  considerations  for  XHTML  will  be noted. See Appendix B at the end of this reference for details on XHTML syntax requirements.  1   This book is organized into the following sections:    HTML5 Overview   HTML5 Global Attributes   Alphabetical List of Elements   Elements Organized by Function   Appendix A, Character Entities   Appendix B, XHTML Syntax Overview  HTML5 Overview HTML5 offers new features  elements, attributes, event han- dlers, and APIs  for easier web application development and more sophisticated form handling.  The HTML5 specification is based on HTML 4.01 Strict, but unlike previous HTML Recommendations, HTML5 does not use a Document Type Definition  DTD . Instead, it uses the  Document Object Model  DOM, the “tree” formed by a docu- ment’s structure  as its basis rather than a particular set of syn- tax rules. It also differs from previous recommendations in that it includes detailed instructions for how browsers should han- dle malformed and legacy markup.  W3C and WHATWG There  are  two  organizations  maintaining  slightly  different HTML specifications as of this writing.  HTML5 was originally written by the Web Hypertext Appli- cation  Technology  Working  Group   WHATWG .  In  2003, members of Apple, Mozilla, and Opera formed the WHATWG to further the development of HTML in a way that was con- sistent  with  real-world  authoring  practices  and  browser  be- havior.  Their  initial  documents,  Web  Applications  1.0  and Web Forms 1.0, were rolled together into HTML5, which is still in development under the guidance of WHATWG editor, Ian Hickson. They eventually dropped the version number and  2  HTML5 Pocket Reference   now maintain “living”  unnumbered  HTML specification at whatwg.org.  In 2006, the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  formed its own  HTML5  Working  Group  based  on  the  work  by  the WHATWG. In 2009, it discontinued its work on XHTML 2.0 in order to focus on the development of HTML5. The W3C maintains  a  “snapshot”   numbered   version  of  HTML5  www.w3.org TR html5  , which is expected to reach Recom- mendation status in 2014. HTML5.1 is also in development and  is  scheduled  to  become  a  Recommendation  in  2016. Nightly builds of the HTML5.1 Editor’s Draft are available at www.w3.org html wg drafts html master .  The  differences  between  the  W3C  and  HTML5  Candidate Recommendation and the WHATWG versions are fairly mi- nor. The WHATWG and HTML5.1 spec change frequently, but the differences as of this writing include:  WHATWG only  ping attribute on a and area elements srcset attribute on img element  WHATWG and W3C HTML5.1 only  data element menuitem element dialog element main element inert global attribute itemid, itemprop, itemref, itemscope, and itemtype global  attributes  onclose and onsort global event handlers download attribute on a and area elements sortable attribute on table element sorted attribute on th element  HTML5 Overview  3   W3C HTML5 only  command element  replaced by menuitem  media attribute on a element pubdate attribute on time element  New Semantic Elements in HTML5 HTML5 includes new semantic elements for marking up page content. Details for each of these elements are provided in the section “Alphabetical List of Elements” on page 14:  article  figcaption  output  aside  audio  bdi  canvas command* data** datalist  details dialog** embed  figure  footer  header hgroup* keygen main** mark menuitem** meter  nav  progress  rp  rt  ruby  section  source  time  track  video  wbr  * Removed from HTML5.1  ** WHATWG and HTML5.1 only  New input types HTML5 introduces the following new input control types  in- dicated as values for the type attribute for the input element : color,  date,  datetime,  datetime-local,  email,  month,  number, range, search, tel, time, url, and week.  4  HTML5 Pocket Reference   Obsolete HTML 4.01 elements The  following  HTML  4.01  elements  were  made  obsolete  in HTML5  because  they  were  presentational,  confusing,  or poorly supported: acronym, applet, basefont, big, center, dir, frame, frameset, font, isindex, noframes, strike, and tt.  HTML5 APIs With a growing demand for interactive content on web pages, HTML5 introduces many APIs  Application Programming In- terfaces  for the creation of web applications. APIs standardize tasks that traditionally required proprietary plug-ins or custom programming. Some have markup components such as audio, video, and canvas; others only use JavaScript and or server-side components.  The following APIs are part of the W3C HTML5 specification:    Media  API,  for  playback  of  video  and  audio  files  with multimedia  synchronization  and  timed  subtitles,  used with the new video and audio elements  bit.ly 17EC8HT and bit.ly 13xEOBr     TextTrack, for adding timed subtitles and captions for  video and audio elements  bit.ly 16ZQm6S     Session History API, for exposing the browser history   bit.ly 12iDo0Q     Offline  Web  Applications  API,  which  allows  web  re-  sources to be used while offline  bit.ly 108K1mp     Editing  API,  including  a  new  global  contenteditable  attribute  bit.ly 11Tw0Tv     Drag  and  Drop  API,  including  the  new  draggable  attribute  bit.ly 18sdPhs   HTML5 Overview  5   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  Other  HTML5-related  APIs  have  separate  specifications, including:    Canvas API for two-dimensional drawing in conjunction  with the new canvas element  bit.ly 17ftf5F     Web  Storage  API  allows  data  to  be  stored  in  the browser’s cache so an app can use it later  bit.ly 168vZjW    Geolocation API lets users share longitude and latitude information for so they are accessible to scripts in web applications  bit.ly 168w5rQ     Web Workers API that allows scripts to run in the back-  ground to improve performance  bit.ly 17ECwWI     Web Sockets API that maintains an open connection be- tween the client and the server so data can pass between them  in  real  time.  This  may  be  useful  for  multi-player games, chat, and live data streams  bit.ly 13UfWUK .    File API gives access to files uploaded from a form input. It enables previews of the uploaded file to be shown and enables drag-and-drop uploading  bit.ly 11sTkro .  This is only a handful of the dozens of APIs in development. The  following  resources  provide  thorough  lists  of  available APIs and other web technologies in an easy-to-use manner:    The Web Platform: Browser Technologies, maintained by  Mike Smith of the W3C  platform.html5.org     HTML5  Landscape  Overview,  by  Erik  Wilde   dret.type-  pad.com dretblog html5-api-overview.html     Web Platform Docs  docs.webplatform.org wiki apis   HTML5 Document Structure HTML5 has only one version and does not reference a DTD, but HTML5 documents still require a simplified DOCTYPE declaration to trigger standards mode rendering in browsers. The  following  is  the  minimum  recommended  structure  of  a basic HTML5 document:  6  HTML5 Pocket Reference                Document Title                Content of document . . .        HTML5 documents written in XML syntax do not require a DOCTYPE but may include an XML declaration. They should also  be  served  as  the  MIME  type  application xhtml+xml  or application xml. The following is a simple HTML5 document written in the XML syntax:               Document Title                Content of document . . .        HTML5 Browser Support Most of the new HTML5 semantic elements and attributes are supported  by  contemporary  desktop  and  mobile  browsers  Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 9+ . For browsers that do not support new elements and APIs, there is usually a JavaScript polyfill  patch  that simulates support. For  a  thorough  list  of  existing  polyfills,  see  Modernizr’s collection  at  www.github.com Modernizr Modernizr wiki  HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills.  One example of a simple polyfill is the “HTML5 Shiv” script created by Remy Sharp. To make older browsers such as In- ternet Explorer 8 and earlier recognize new HTML5 elements  thus making them accessible to styles and scripts , you could write JavaScript to create each element in DOM one at a time.  HTML5 Overview  7   For example, this command creates a section element:  document.createElement "section" ;  The HTML5 Shiv script, created by Remy Sharp, creates all of the new elements for you at once. To use it, simply point to the Google-hosted script shown here:    <script src="http:  html5shiv.googlecode.com svn trunk  html5-els.js">     The following resources are useful for tracking HTML5 real- world support and use:  “When Can I Use…”  A comparison of browser support for HTML5, CSS3, and other web technologies maintained by Alexis Deveria.

Validating HTML5 Documents You can check to see if your HTML5 document is valid using the online validator at validator.w3.org  HTML5 support is in beta as of this writing  or html5.validator.nu.  8  HTML5 Pocket Reference   HTML5 Global Attributes A number of attributes are shared by all elements in HTML5 and are referred to collectively as the Global Attributes:  accesskey="character"  Assigns an access key  shortcut key command  that acti- vates or focuses the element. The value is a single charac- ter.  Users  may  access  the  element  by  hitting  Alt-   PC  or Ctrl-   Mac .  class="text string"  Assigns one or more classification names to the element.  contenteditable="truefalse"  Not in HTML 4.01. Indicates the user can edit the ele- ment. This attribute is already well supported in current browser versions.  contextmenu="id of menu element"  Not in HTML 4.01. Specifies a context menu that applies to the element. The context menu must be requested by the user, for example, by a right-click.  dir="ltrrtlauto"  Specifies the direction of the element. ltr indicates left to right; rtl indicates right to left; and auto indicates that direction should be determined programmatically.  draggable="truefalse"  Not in HTML 4.01. Indicates the element is draggable, meaning it can be moved by clicking and holding on it, and then moving it to a new position in the window.  dropzone="copymovelinkstring:text string type file:file type"  Not in HTML 4.01. Indicates what happens when a data is dragged onto the element and what kind of data to ac- cept. copy results in a copy of the dragged data; move moves the data to a new location; and link results in a link to the original data. Including string:text plain allows it to ac- cept any text string. The file: attribute indicates what type  of  file  is  accepted   e.g.,  file:image png .  Both  the  HTML5 Global Attributes   9   action and accepted data may be provided, for example, dropzone="copy string:text plain".  hidden  hidden="hidden" in XHTML   Not  in  HTML  4.01.  Prevents  the  element  and  its  de- scendants  from  being  rendered  in  the  user  agent  browser . Any scripts or form controls in hidden sections will still execute, but they will not be presented to the user.  id="text string"  Assigns a unique identifying name to the element.  inert  inert="inert" in XHTML   WHATWG  &  HTML5.1  only.  Indicates  that  the  ele- ment should be made inert, which means it cannot be se- lected, searched, or targeted by user interactions.  itemid="text"  WHATWG & HTML5.1 only. Part of the microdata  system  for  embedding  machine-readable  data,  the itemid attribute indicates a globally recognized identifier  such as an ISBN for a book . It is used in conjunction with itemtype in the same element containing itemscope.  itemprop="text"  WHATWG  &  HTML5.1  only.  Part  of  the  microdata system  for  embedding  machine-readable  data,  the  item prop  attribute  provides  the  name  of  the  property.  The content of the element provides its value. The value may also be a URL provided by the href attribute in a elements or the src attribute in img.  itemref="space-separated list of IDs"  WHATWG  &  HTML5.1  only.  Part  of  the  microdata system  for  embedding  machine-readable  data,  the  item ref attribute specifies a list of elements  by ID values  on the current page to be included in an item. The itemref attribute must be used in the same element as the item scope attribute that established the item.  10  HTML5 Pocket Reference   itemscope  WHATWG  &  HTML5.1  only.  Part  of  the  microdata system for embedding machine-readable data, itemscope creates  a  new  item,  a  group  of  properties   name value pairs .  itemtype="URL or reversed DNS label"  WHATWG  &  HTML5.1  only.  Part  of  the  microdata system  for  embedding  machine-readable  data,  the  item type attribute indicates a standardized item type indicated by  a  URL   e.g.,  http:  vocab.example.net book   or  a  re- versed DNS label  e.g., com.example.person . The item type attribute is used in the same element containing the itemscope attribute.  Specifies  the  language  for  the  element  by  its  language code.  lang  xml:lang  XHTML  only.  Specifies  language  for  elements  in XHTML documents. spellcheck="truefalse"  Not in HTML 4.01. Indicates the element is to have its spelling and grammar checked.  style="CSS styles"  tabindex="number"  Associates style information with an element.  Specifies the position of the current element in the tabbing order for the current document. The value must be be- tween 0 and 32,767. It is used for tabbing through the links on a page  or fields in a form .  title="text string"  translate="yesno"  Provides a title or advisory information about the element.  Not in HTML 4.01. Indicates whether the element’s text content and attribute values should be translated when the document is localized. yes is the default; no leaves the element content unchanged.  HTML5 Global Attributes   11   The following attributes are not included in the list of Global Attributes but are permitted in HTML5 documents:  aria-*="text string or number"  Not in HTML 4.01. Allows any of the WAI-ARIA states and properties for improving accessibility to be applied to an element, for example, aria-hidden="true". The value of the attribute varies with the property. See www.w3.org  TR wai-aria states_and_properties  for  information  on supported of states and properties.  data-*="text string or numerical data"  Not in HTML 4.01. Enables authors to create custom data-related  attributes,  for  example,  data-length,  data- duration, data-speed, etc., so that nonvisible data can be embedded and used by a custom application or scripts.  role="standardized WAI-ARIA role"  Not  in  HTML  4.01.  Assigns  one  of  the  standardized WAI-ARIA  roles  to  an  element  to  make  its  purpose clearer  to  users  with  disabilities.  The  landmark  roles  application,  banner,  complementary,  contentinfo,  form, main, navigation, and search  play an important role in navigation on assistive devices. See www.w3.org TR wai- aria rolesrole_definitions for a complete list of allowable role values.  12  HTML5 Pocket Reference   HTML5 Event Handlers Unless otherwise specified, the following event handler con- tent attributes may be specified on any HTML element:  onabort onblur* oncancel oncanplay oncanplaythrough onchange onclick onclose** oncontextmenu oncuechange ondblclick ondrag ondragend ondragenter  ondragleave ondragover ondragstart ondrop ondurationchange onemptied onended onerror* onfocus* oninput oninvalid onkeydown onkeypress onkeyup  onload* onloadeddata onloadedmetadata onloadstart onmousedown onmousemove onmouseout onmouseover onmouseup onmousewheel onpause onplay onplaying onprogress  onratechange onreset onscroll onseeked onseeking onselect onshow onsort** onstalled onsubmit onsuspend ontimeupdate onvolumechange onwaiting  NOTE  onblur, onerror, onfocus, and onload behave slightly dif- ferently when applied to the body element because the body element shares these event handlers with its parent window.  * Event handler for Window object when used with the body element.  ** WHATWG and HTML5.1 only.

HTML5 Global Attributes   13   Alphabetical List of Elements This  section  contains  a  list  of  all  elements  and  attributes  in HTML and the living HTML document at WHATWG. Read- ers  are  advised  to  watch  for  these  labels  on  elements  and attributes:  Required  Attributes marked as Required must be included in the element for the markup to be valid.  W3C HTML5 only  Elements and attributes marked W3C HTML5 only ap- pear only in the W3C HTML5 Candidate Recommenda- tion and do not appear in the HTML5.1 Editor’s Draft or WHATWG. WHATWG only  Elements and attributes marked WHATWG only appear only in the living HTML specification maintained by the WHATWG and are not part of the W3C Recommenda- tion.  Not in HTML 4.01  Elements and attributes marked Not in HTML 4.01 are new  in  HTML5  and  will  cause  documents  using  the HTML 4.01, XHTML1.0, and XHTML 1.1 DOCTYPEs to be invalid.  Attributes  marked  XHTML  only  apply  only  to  docu- ments written in XHTML  XML  syntax.  XHTML only  a    . . .    Defines an anchor that can be used as a hypertext link or a named fragment within the document. When the href attribute is set to a valid URI, the anchor is a hypertext link to a web page, page frag- ment, or another resource. The id attribute labels an anchor and  14  HTML5 Pocket Reference   allows it to serve as the destination point of a link. An a element may have both href and id attributes. The href attribute may be omitted to use an a element as a “placeholder link.”  HTML5 permits flow content  block elements  within a elements. There must be no interactive content  a, audio with controls, button, details,  embed,  iframe,  img  with  usemap,  input,  keygen,  label, object with usemap, select, textarea, and video with controls  con- tained in an a element.

More commonly, because different browsers support different audio formats, a series of file format options are provided with source elements contained in the audio  element.  Other  fallback  content  may  be  provided  in  the audio element for nonsupporting browsers.  There is still debate regarding the supported audio format for the audio element. No file format is supported by all browsers.

Notes Although commonly supported by browsers, the embed element was not part of the HTML 4.01 or earlier specifications  in favor of the object element for embedded media ; however, it has been added to the HTML5. Because it was supported but not documented, it has many browser- and media-specific attributes, and its syntax is not clear. Many developers use both object and embed for a single media object for backward compatibility, even though it does not conform to the standard.

There are six levels of headings, from  h1  most important  to  h6  least important . HTML syntax requires that headings appear in order   for  example,  an  h2  should  not  precede  an  h1   for  proper document structure. Doing so not only improves accessibility, but aids in search engine optimization  information in higher heading levels is given more weight .  Alphabetical List of Elements   59   Note In HTML5, heading order can be repeated within sections of the same  document,  allowing  greater  flexibility  with  heading  levels. This is to aid the outlining of documents and allows sections of a document to fall into the outline correctly no matter which docu- ment the section appears in. The HTML5 outline algorithm is not well supported as of this writing.

The attributes required for the object element vary with the type of content it is placing. The embedded content may be treated as an image, a nes- ted  browsing  context,  or  may  be  processed  by  a  plug-in.  The object  element  may  contain  content  that  will  be  rendered  if  the object cannot be embedded. The object element may also contain a number of param elements that pass important information to the object when it displays or plays. Not all objects require additional parameters. The object and param elements work together to allow authors to specify three types of information:    The  implementation  of  the  object—that  is,  the  executable  code that runs in order to render the object.    The data to be rendered. The data attribute specifies the loca- tion of the resource, in most cases an external file, such as a movie or a PDF.    Additional settings required by the object at runtime. Some embedded media objects require additional settings that get called into play when the object plays or is rendered.

This process is known as escaping the character. Escaped characters are indicated by character  references  that  begin  with  &  and  end  with  ;.  The character may be referred to by its Numeric Character Refer- ence  NCR  or a predefined character entity name.  A Numeric Character Reference refers to a character by its Uni- code code point in either decimal or hexadecimal form. Hex- adecimal  values  are  indicated  by  an  “x”:  &xhhhh;.  Decimal character references use the syntax &nnnn;  no “x” character . For example, the em-dash  —  character has the Unicode code point U+02014, which can be identified as &x2014  hexadec- imal  or &8212;  decimal  in an HTML document. Character entities  or Named Character References  are abbre- viated names for characters, such as &lt; for the less-than sym- bol.  Character  entities  are  predefined  in  markup  languages such as HTML and XHTML as a convenience to authors be- cause they may be easier to remember than Numeric Character References. HTML 4.01 defined 252 character entities. That number has grown to more than 2,000 in HTML5.  157   The remainder of this section lists only the most commonly used character references and entities. For additional character references, see the following resources:  W3C Character Entity Reference Chart  This visual chart organizes 488 characters in numerical order by Unicode code point. It features extra large char- acters for easy scanning and lists both numeric and named references.

General Punctuation  163    APPENDIX B XHTML Syntax Overview  XHTML  eXtensible HyperText Markup Language  is a refor- mulation  of  HTML  according  to  the  stricter  syntax  rules  of XML  eXtensible Markup Language . HTML5 can be written using XHTML syntax  formally called the XML Serialization of HTML5 . This section describes the ways in which XHTML syntax differs from HTML.  Because XHTML is an XML language, its syntax is stricter and differs from HTML in these key ways:    All element names and attributes must be lowercase. For  example,  ... .    All elements must be terminated—that is, they must in-  clude an end tag. For example,  ... .    Empty elements must be terminated as well. This is done by including a slash at the end of the tag. A space is com- monly added before the slash for backward compatibility with older browsers—for example,  ,  , and  .    All attribute values must be contained in quotation marks  either single or double . For example,  .   All attribute values must be explicit and may not be mini- mized to one word, as is permitted in HTML—for exam- ple, checked="checked".  165     Nesting restrictions are more strictly enforced. These re-  strictions are explicitly stated:  — An a element cannot contain another a element. — The pre element cannot contain img, object, applet,  big, small, sub, sup, font, or basefont.  — The  form  element  may  not  contain  other  form  — A  button  element  cannot  contain  a,  form,  input, select, textarea, label, button, iframe, or isindex. — The  label  element  cannot  contain  other  label  elements.  elements.    The special characters  , &, ', and " must always be rep- resented by their character entities, including when they appear within attribute values. For example, &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &apos;, and &quot;  respectively .    XHTML documents must use id instead of name for iden- tifying document fragments and in a, applet, form, frame, iframe, img, and map elements.    XHTML  documents  should  be  served  as  XML  applica- tions, not as HTML text documents. More specifically, the server should be configured to serve XHTML docu- ments with the Content-type header set to application  xhtml+xml. If it is not possible to configure the server, the content  type  may  be  specified  in  a  meta  element  in  the document’s head, as shown in this example:  <meta http-equiv="content-type"   content="application xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8"  >  Unfortunately, some popular browsers  Internet Explorer in particular  cannot parse XHTML documents as XML, causing pages to break.
