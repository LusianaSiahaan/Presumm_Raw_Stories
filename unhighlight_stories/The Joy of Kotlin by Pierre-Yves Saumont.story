Since then, a version of Kotlin running on the JavaScript virtual machine as  been released, as well as a version compiling to native code. This makes Kotlin a much  more universal language than Java, although there are great differences between these  versions because the Java version relies upon the Java standard library, which isn’t avail- able in the two others. JetBrains, the creator or Kotlin, is working hard to bring each  version to an equivalent level, but this will take some time.  The JVM   Java Virtual Machine  version is by far the most used version, and this  has seen a great boost when Google decided to adopt Kotlin as an official language for  developing Android applications. One of the primary reasons for Google’s adoption  was that the version of Java available under Android is Java 6, whereas Kotlin offers most  of the features of Java 11 and much more. Kotlin was also adopted by Gradle as the offi- cial language for writing build scripts to replace Groovy, which allows using the same  language for the build and for what is built.  Kotlin is primarily targeted at Java programmers. There might come a time when  programmers will learn Kotlin as their primary language. But for now, most program- mers will only be transitioning from Java to Kotlin.  Each language has its own way, determined by some fundamental concepts. Java was  created with several strong concepts in mind. It’s supposed to run everywhere, meaning  in any environment for which a JVM is available. The promise was, “Write once, run  anywhere.” Although some may argue otherwise, this promise was fulfilled. Not only  can you run Java programs nearly everywhere, but you can also run programs written in  other languages and compiled for the JVM. Kotlin is one of those languages.  xi   xii xii  preface  Another of Java’s promises was that no evolution would ever break existing code.  Although this hasn’t always been true, it has most often been respected. But this might  not  be  a  good  thing.  The  main  consequence  is  that  many  improvements  in  other  languages  couldn’t  be  brought  into  Java  because  those  improvements  would  have  destroyed compatibility. Any program compiled with a previous version of Java must be  able to run in the newer versions without being recompiled. Whether this is useful or  not is a matter of opinion, but the result is that backward compatibility has constantly  played against Java’s evolution.  Java was also supposed to make programs safer by using checked exceptions, thus  forcing programmers to take these exceptions into consideration. For many program- mers, this has proven to be a burden, leading to the practice of constantly wrapping  checked exceptions into unchecked ones.  Although Java is an object-oriented language, it’s supposed to be as fast as most lan- guages for crunching numbers. The language designers decided that besides objects  representing numbers and Boolean values, Java would benefit from having correspond- ing non-object primitives, allowing for much faster computations. The consequence  was that you couldn’t  and still can’t  put primitives into collections such as lists, sets,  or maps. And when streams were added, the language designers decided to create spe- cific versions for primitives—but not all primitives, only those most commonly used. If  you’re using some of the unsupported primitives, you’re out of luck.  The same thing happened with functions. Generic functions were added to Java 8,  but they only allowed manipulating objects, not primitives. So specialized functions  were designed to handle integers, longs, doubles, and Booleans.  Again, unfortunately,  not all primitives. There are no functions for byte, short, and float primitive types.  To  make things even worse, additional functions were needed to convert from one primi- tive type to another or from primitives to objects and back.  Java was designed more than 20 years ago. Many things have changed since that time,  but most of those changes couldn’t be brought into Java. That’s because it would have  broken compatibility, or they were brought into Java in such a way that compatibility was  preserved at the expense of usability.  Many new languages, such as Groovy, Scala, and Clojure, have since been released to  address these limitations. These languages are compatible with Java to a certain extent,  meaning that you can use existing Java libraries in projects written in these languages,  and Java programmers can use libraries developed in these languages.  Kotlin is different. Kotlin is much more strongly integrated with Java, to the point  that you can mix Kotlin and Java source code in the same project without any diffi- culties!  Unlike  other  JVM  languages,  Kotlin  doesn’t  look  like  a  different  language   although it’s somewhat different . Instead, it looks like what Java should have become.  Some even say that Kotlin is Java made right, meaning that it fixes most of the problems  with the Java language.  Kotlin has yet to deal with the limitations of the JVM, however.  But more importantly, Kotlin was designed to be much friendlier towards many tech- niques coming from functional programming. Kotlin has both mutable and immutable    preface       xiii xiii  references, but it heavily promotes immutable ones. Kotlin also has a great part of the  functional abstractions that let you avoid control structures  although it also has tradi- tional control structures in order to smooth the transition from traditional languages . Another great benefit of using Kotlin is that it reduces the need for boilerplate code,  allowing for the bare minimum. With Kotlin, you can create a class with optional prop- erties  plus equals, hashCode, toString, and copy functions  in a single line of code,  where the same class written in Java would need about thirty lines  including getters,  setters, and overloaded constructors .  Although other languages exist that were designed to overcome Java’s limitations in  the JVM environment, Kotlin is different because it integrates with Java programs at the  project source level. You can mix Java and Kotlin source files in the same projects with  a single build chain. This is a game changer, especially regarding team programming,  where using Kotlin in a Java environment is no more a hassle than using any third-party  library. This makes for the smoothest possible transition from Java to a new language,  and that makes it possible for you to write programs that are:  ¡	Safer ¡	Easier to write, test, and maintain ¡	More scalable  I suspect that many readers will be Java programmers looking for new solutions to their  day-to-day problems. If this is you, you may be asking why you should use Kotlin. Aren’t  there already other languages in the Java ecosystem with which you can easily apply  safe programming techniques?  Sure there are, and one of the most well-known is Scala. Scala is a very good alterna- tive to Java, but Kotlin has something more. Scala can interact with Java at the library  level, meaning that Java programs can use Scala libraries  objects and functions  and  Scala libraries can use Java libraries  objects and methods . But Scala and Java pro- grams have to be built as separate projects, or at least separate modules, whereas Kotlin  and Java classes can be mixed inside the same module.

This doesn’t mean that  you should only use Kotlin if you want to write safer programs and, even less, that only  Kotlin allows writing safer programs. This book uses Kotlin for all examples because  Kotlin is one of the friendliest languages for writing safe programs in the JVM  Java  Virtual Machine  ecosystem.  This book teaches techniques that were developed long ago in many different envi- ronments, although many of those come from functional programming. But this book  isn’t about fundamentalist functional programming. This book is about pragmatic safe  programming.  All the techniques described have been put in production in the Java ecosystem for  years and have proven to be effective in producing programs with much fewer imple- mentation bugs than traditional imperative programming techniques. These safe tech- niques can be implemented in any language, and they’ve been used by some for many  years in Java. But often, using these techniques has been accomplished through strug- gling to overcome Java limitations.  This book isn’t about learning programming from level zero. It’s aimed at program- mers in professional environments who are looking for an easier and safer way to write  bug-free programs.  xv   xvi xvi  about this book  What you’ll learn In  this  book,  you’ll  learn  specific  techniques  that  might  differ  from  what  you’ve  learned if you’re a Java programmer. Most of these techniques will sound unfamiliar or  will even contradict what programmers usually recognize as best practices. But many   though not all  best practices are from the days when computers had 640K of mem- ory, 5 MB of disk storage, and a single-core processor. Things have changed. Nowadays,  a simple smartphone is a computer with 3 GB or more RAM, 256 GB of solid-state disk  storage, and an 8-core processor; likewise, computers have many gigabytes of memory,  terabytes of storage, and multi-core processors. The techniques I cover in this book include:  ¡	Pushing abstraction further ¡	Favoring immutability ¡	Understanding referential transparency ¡	Encapsulating state mutation sharing ¡	Abstracting control flow and control structures ¡	Using the right types ¡	Working with laziness ¡	And more  Pushing abstraction further One of the most important techniques you’ll learn about is pushing abstraction much  further  although traditional programmers consider premature abstraction to be as  evil as premature optimization . But pushing abstraction further results in a much bet- ter understanding of the problem to solve, which, in turn, results in more often solving  the right problem instead of a different one.  You might wonder what pushing abstraction further really means. Simply, it means  recognizing common patterns in different computations and abstracting these patterns  in order to avoid rewriting them again and again.  Immutability Immutability is a technique that consists in using only non-modifiable data. Many tra- ditional programmers have trouble imagining how it can be possible to write useful  programs using only immutable data. Isn’t programming primarily based upon mod- ifying data? Well, this is like believing that accounting is primarily modifying values in  an accounting book.  The transition from mutable to immutable accounting was made in the 15th century,  and the principle of immutability has been recognized since then as the main element  of safety for accounting. This principle also applies to programming, as you’ll see in this  book.   about this book       xvii xvii  Referential transparency Referential transparency is a technique that lets you write programs, mean- ing programs whose results you can predict and reason about. These programs always produce  they always produce the same results, but that variations in results only depend on varia- tions in input and not on external conditions.  deterministic  doesn’t   results   input.   mean   when   given   same   same   This   that   the   the   Not only are such programs safer  because you always know how they’ll behave , but they’re much easier to compose, to maintain, to update, and to test. And programs that are easier to test are generally tested better and, hence, are more reliable.  Encapsulated state mutation sharing Immutable data is automatically protected against accidental sharing of state mutation, which causes many problems in concurrent and parallel processing, such as deadlock, livelock, thread starvation, and stale data. But making state mutation sharing impossi- ble, because there’s no state mutation, is a problem when state must be shared. This is the case in concurrent and parallel programming.  By removing state mutation, you make accidental sharing of state mutation impossi- ble, so programs are safer. But parallel and concurrent programming implies sharing state mutation. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be any cooperation between parallel or con- current threads. This specific use case of shared state mutation can be abstracted and encapsulated so that it can be reused without risk because the single implementation will have been fully tested instead of reimplementing it each time it’s used, as is the case in traditional programming.  In this book, you’ll learn how to abstract and encapsulate state mutation sharing so  that you’ll only have to write it once. Then you can reuse it everywhere you need it.  Abstracting control flow and control structures The second common source of bugs in programs, after sharing mutable state, is con- trol structures. Traditional programs are composed of control structures such as loops and conditional testing. It’s so easy to mess with these structures that language design- ers  examples abstract  is the loop that’s now present in most languages  although in Java it’s still simply called  possible.   details   much   tried   have   for .

Using value types  can completely eliminate this kind of problem at a very low cost, even if the language  you’re using doesn’t offer true value types.  Laziness Most of the common languages are said to be strict, meaning that arguments passed to  a method or function are evaluated first before being processed. This seems to make  sense, although it often doesn’t. On the contrary, laziness is a technique consisting in  evaluating elements only if and when those are used. Programming is essentially based  upon laziness.  For example, in an if...else structure, the condition is strictly evaluated, meaning  that it’s evaluated before being tested, but the branches are lazily evaluated, meaning  that only the branch corresponding to the condition is executed. This laziness is totally  implicit and the programmer doesn’t control it. Making explicit use of laziness will help  you write much more efficient programs.  Audience This book is for readers with some previous programming experience in Java. Some  understanding  of  parameterized  types   generics   is  also  assumed.  This  book  makes  heavy  use  of  such  techniques,  including  parameterized  function  calls,  or  variance,  which aren’t often used in Java  although it’s a powerful technique . Don’t be afraid if  you don’t know these techniques already; I’ll explain what they mean and why they’re  needed.  How this book is organized: A roadmap This book is intended to be read sequentially because each chapter builds upon the  concepts learned in the previous ones. I use the word read, but this book isn’t intended  to just be read. Very few sections contain theory only.  To get the most out of this book, read it at your computer, solving each exercise as  you go. Each chapter includes a number of exercises with the necessary instructions  and hints to help you arrive at the solution. Each exercise comes with a proposed solu- tion and test that you can use to verify that your solution is correct.  NOTE      All  the  code  is  available  as  a  separate  free  download  from  GitHub   http:  github.com pysaumont fpinkotlin . The code comes with all the nec- essary elements for the project to be imported into IntelliJ  recommended  or  to be compiled and run using Gradle 4. If you use Gradle, you can edit the code  with any text editor. Kotlin is supposed to be usable with Eclipse, but I can’t  guarantee this. IntelliJ is a far superior IDE and is downloadable for free from  the Jetbrains site  https:  www.jetbrains.com idea download .   about this book       xix xix  Completing the exercises The  exercises  are  essential  to  your  learning  and  to  understanding  what  this  book  teaches. Please note that you’re not expected to understand most of the concepts pre- sented in this book just by reading the text. Doing the exercises is probably the most  important part of the learning process, so I encourage you not to skip any exercises.  Some exercises may seem quite difficult, and you might be tempted to look at the  proposed solutions. It’s perfectly okay to do so, but you should then go back to the  exercise and do it without looking at the solution. If you only read the solution, you’ll  probably have trouble later trying to solve more advanced exercises.  This approach doesn’t require much tedious typing because you’ve nearly nothing to  copy. Most exercises consist in writing implementations for functions, for which you’re  given the environment and the function signature. No exercise solution is longer than  a dozen lines of code; the majority are around four or five lines long. Once you finish an  exercise  which means when your implementation compiles , just run the correspond- ing test to verify that it’s correct.  One important thing to note is that each exercise is self-contained in regards to the  rest of the chapter, so code created inside a chapter is duplicated from one exercise to  the next. This is necessary because each exercise is often built upon the preceding one,  so although the same class might be used, implementations differ. As a consequence,  you shouldn’t look at a later exercise before you complete the previous ones because  you’d see the solutions to yet unsolved exercises.  Learning the techniques in this book The techniques described in this book aren’t more difficult to master than traditional  ones. They are just different. You can solve the same problems with traditional tech- niques, but translating from one technique to the other can sometimes be inefficient. Learning new techniques is like learning a foreign language. Just as you can’t effi- ciently think in one language and translate to another, you can’t think in traditional  programming based upon state mutation and control flow and translate your code to  functions handling immutable data. And, just as you have to learn to think in a new lan- guage, you have to learn to think differently. This doesn’t come with reading alone; it  comes with writing code. So you have to practice!  This is why I don’t expect you to understand what’s in this book just by reading it, and  why I provide so many exercises; you must do the exercises to fully grasp the concepts.  This isn’t because each topic is so complex that it isn’t possible to understand it through  reading alone. If you could understand it just by reading without doing the exercises,  you probably wouldn’t need this book.  For all these reasons, the exercises are key to getting the most out of this book. I  encourage you to try solving each exercise before you continue reading. If you don’t  find a solution, try again rather than going directly to the solution I provide.   xx xx  about this book  If you’ve a hard time understanding something, ask questions on the forum  see the  next section . Asking questions and getting answers on the forum will not only help you,  it’ll also help the person answering the question  along with others who have the same  question . We all learn by answering questions  mostly our own questions, by the way   much more than by asking them.  About the code  This book contains many examples of source code both in numbered listings and in  line with normal text. In both cases, source code is formatted in a fixed-width font  like this to separate it from ordinary text.   In  many  cases,  the  original  source  code  has  been  reformatted;  we’ve  added  line  breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the book.  Code annotations accompany many of the listings, highlighting important concepts.  You can download the code as an archive, or you can clone it using Git. The code for  the exercises is organized in modules with names that reflect the chapter titles rather  than the chapter numbers. As a result, IntelliJ will sort them alphabetically rather than  in the order in which they appear in the book.  To help you figure out which module corresponds to each chapter, I’ve provided a  list of the chapters with the corresponding module names in the README file accom- panying the code  http:  github.com pysaumont fpinkotlin .

He is an R&D engineer at ASN  Alcatel  Submarine Networks .  xxi   about the cover illustration  The Joy of Kotlin  is captioned “Habit of a Lady in Chinese The figure on the cover of A Collection of the Dresses Tartary, 1700.” The illustration is taken from Thomas Jefferys’ of Different  four volumes , London, published between 1757 and 1772. The title page states that these are hand-colored copperplate engrav- ings, heightened with gum arabic.  Nations, Ancient and Modern     Thomas Jefferys  1719–1771  was called “Geographer to King George III.” He was an English cartographer who was the leading map supplier of his day. He engraved and printed maps for government and other official bodies and produced a wide range of commercial maps and atlases, especially of North America. His work as a mapmaker sparked an interest in local dress customs of the lands he surveyed and mapped, which are brilliantly displayed in this collection. Fascination with faraway lands and travel for pleasure were relatively new phenomena in the late 18th century, and collections such as this one were popular, introducing both the tourist as well as the armchair traveler to the inhabitants of other countries.  The diversity of the drawings in Jefferys’ volumes speaks vividly of the uniqueness and individuality of the world’s nations some 200 years ago. Dress codes have changed since then, and the diversity by region and country, so rich at the time, has faded away. It’s now often hard to tell the inhabitants of one continent from another. Perhaps, try- ing to view it optimistically, we’ve traded a cultural and visual diversity for a more varied personal life—or a more varied and interesting intellectual and technical life.  At a time when it’s difficult to tell one computer book from another, Manning cele- brates the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life by Jeffreys’ pictures.  xxii                                                                 1Making programs safer  This chapter covers ¡	Identifying programming traps ¡	Looking at problems with side effects ¡	How referential transparency makes    programs safer  about programs  ¡	Using the substitution model to reason    ¡	Making the most of abstraction  Programming is a dangerous activity. If you’re a hobbyist programmer, you may  be surprised to read this. You probably thought you were safe sitting in front of  your screen and keyboard. You might think that you don’t risk much more than  some back pain from sitting too long, some vision problems from reading tiny  characters onscreen, or even some wrist tendonitis if you happen to type too furi- ously. But if you’re  or want to be  a professional programmer, the reality is much  worse than this.  1   2  chapter 1  Making programs safer  The main danger is the bugs that are lurking in your programs. Bugs can cost a lot  if they manifest at the wrong time. Remember the Y2K bug? Many programs written  between 1960 and 1990 used only two digits to represent the year in dates because the  programmers didn’t expect their programs would last until the next century. Many of  these programs that were still in use in the 1990s would have handled the year 2000 as  1900. The estimated cost of that bug, actualized in 2017 US dollars, was $417 billion.1  But for bugs occurring in a single program, the cost can be much higher. On June 4,  1996, the first flight of the French Ariane 5 rocket ended after 36 seconds with a crash.  It appears that the crash was due to a single bug in the navigation system. A single inte- ger arithmetic overflow caused a $370 million loss.2  How would you feel if you were held responsible for such a disaster? How would you  feel if you were writing this kind of program on a day-to-day basis, never sure that a pro- gram working today will still be working tomorrow? This is what most programmers do:  write undeterministic programs that don’t produce the same result each time they are  run with the same input data. Users are aware of this, and when a program doesn’t work  as expected, they try again, as if the same cause could produce a different effect the  next time. And it sometimes does because nobody knows what these programs depend  on for their output.  With the development of artificial intelligence  AI , the problem of software reliabil- ity becomes more crucial. If programs are meant to make decisions that can jeopardize  human life, such as flying planes or driving autonomous cars, we’d better be sure they  work as intended.  What do we need to make safer programs? Some will answer that we need better  programmers. But good programmers are like good drivers. Of the programmers, 90%  agree that only 10% of all programmers are good enough, but at the same time, 90% of  the programmers think they are part of the 10%!  The most needed quality for programmers is to acknowledge their own limitations.  Let’s face it: we are only, at best, average programmers. We spend 20% of our time  writing buggy programs, and then we spend 40% of our time refactoring our code to  obtain programs with no apparent bugs. And later, we spend another 40% debugging  code that’s already in production because bugs come in two categories: apparent and  non-apparent. Rest assured, non-apparent bugs will become apparent—it’s just a mat- ter of time. The question remains: how long and how much damage will be done before  the bugs become apparent.  What can we do about this problem? No programming tool, technique, or discipline  will ever guarantee that our programs are completely bug-free. But many program- ming practices exist that can eliminate some categories of bugs and guarantee that the  remaining bugs only appear in isolated  unsafe  areas of our programs.

Among  such practices are writing programs that are so simple that they obviously have no bugs,  rather than writing programs that are so complex that they have no obvious bugs.3  In the rest of this chapter, I briefly present concepts like immutability, referential  transparency, and the substitution model, as well as other suggestions, which together  you can use to make your programs much safer. You’ll apply these concepts over and  over in the upcoming chapters.  Programming traps Programming is often seen as a way of describing how some process is to be carried  out. Such a description generally includes actions that mutate a state in a program’s  model to solve a problem and decisions about the result of such mutations. This is  something everyone understands and practices, even if they aren’t programmers.  If you have some complex task to achieve, you divide it into steps. You then execute  the first step and examine the result. Following the result of this examination, you con- tinue with the next step or another. For example, a program for adding two positive  values a and b might be represented by the following pseudocode:  ¡	if b = 0, return a ¡	else increment a and decrement b ¡	start again with the new a and b  In this pseudocode, you can recognize the traditional instructions of most languages:  testing conditions, mutating variables, branching, and returning a value. This code can  be represented graphically by a flow chart like that shown in figure 1.1.  You can easily see how such a program could go wrong. Change any data on the flow- chart, or change the origin or the destination of any arrow, and you get a potentially   3    “...there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious de- ficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.” See C.A.R. Hoare, “The Emperor’s Old Clothes,” Communications of the ACM  24  February 1981 : 75–83.         4  chapter 1  Making programs safer  buggy program. If you’re lucky, you could get a program that doesn’t run at all, or that  runs forever and never stops. This could be considered as good luck because you’d  immediately see that there’s a problem that needs fixing. Figure 1.2 shows three exam- ples of such problems.  The  first  example  produces  an  erroneous  result,  and  the  second  and  the  third  never terminate. Note, however, that your programming language might not allow  you to write some of these examples. None of these could be written in a language  that doesn’t allow mutating references, and none of them could be written in a lan- guage that doesn’t allow branching or looping. You might think all you have to do is  to use such a language. And, in fact, you could. But you’d be restricted to a small num- ber of languages and probably none of them would be allowed in your professional  environment.  Is there a solution? Yes, there is. What you can do is to avoid using mutable refer- ences, branching  if your language allows it , and looping. All you need to do is to pro- gram with discipline.  Don’t use dangerous features like mutations and loops. It’s as simple as that! And if  you do find that you eventually need mutable references or loops, abstract them. Write  some component that abstracts state mutation once and for all, and you’ll never again  have to deal with the problem.  Some more or less exotic languages offer this out of the  box, but these too are probably not languages you can use in your environment.  The  same applies to looping. In this case, most modern languages offer abstractions of loop- ing alongside a more traditional usage of loops. Again, it’s a question of discipline. Only  use the good parts! More on this in chapters 4 and 5.  Another common source of bugs is the null reference. As you’ll see in chapter 6,  with Kotlin you can clearly separate code that allows null references from code that  forbids these. But ultimately, it’s up to you to completely eradicate the use of null refer- ences from your programs.  Many bugs are caused by programs depending on the outside world to execute cor- rectly.

These blocks of code have a scope, meaning an area of the program that’s visible only by those blocks. Blocks not only have visibility of the enclosing scope, but this itself also provides visibility of the outer scopes and, by transitivity, to the outside world. Any mutation of the outside world caused by a function or method  such as mutating the enclosing scope, like the class in which the method is defined  is, therefore, an effect.  Some  methods  functions  return a value. Some mutate the outer world, and some do both. When a method or function returns a value and has an effect, this is called a side effect. Programming with side effects is wrong in all cases. In medicine, the term “side effects” is primarily used to describe unwanted, adverse secondary outcomes. In programming, a side effect is something that’s observable outside of the program and comes  the result returned by the program.  in addition to  If the program doesn’t return a result, you can’t call its observable effect a side effect; it’s the primary effect. It can still have side  secondary  effects, although this is also gener- ally considered bad practice, following what’s called the “single responsibility” principle.

But this value can, in fact, be a new program that you can run to eval- uate the effect. Such a technique can be used in any language, but it’s often considered  inefficient  which is arguable . A safe alternative is to clearly separate effects evaluation  from the rest of the program and even, as much as possible, to abstract effect evalua- tion. You’ll learn many techniques allowing this in chapters 7, 11, and 12.  1.1.2  Making programs safer with referential transparency  Having no side effects  not mutating anything in the external world  isn’t enough to  make a program safe and deterministic. Programs also mustn’t be affected by the exter- nal world—the output of a program should depend only on its argument. This means  that programs shouldn’t read data from the console, a file, a remote URL, a database,  or even from the system.  Code that neither mutates nor depends on the external world is said to be referentially   transparent. Referentially transparent code has several interesting attributes:  ¡	It’s self-contained. You can use it in any context; all you have to do is to provide a   valid argument.  ¡	It’s deterministic. It always returns the same value for the same argument so you  won’t be surprised. It might, however, return a wrong result, but at least for the  same argument, the result never changes.  ¡	It will never throw any kind of exception. It might throw errors, such as out-of-memory  errors  OOMEs  or stack-overflow errors  SOEs , but these errors mean that the  code has a bug. This isn’t a situation either you, as a programmer, or the users of  your API are supposed to handle  besides crashing the application, which often  won’t happen automatically, and eventually fixing the bug .  ¡	It doesn’t create conditions causing other code to unexpectedly fail. It won’t mutate argu- ments or some other external data, for example, causing the caller to find itself  with stale data or concurrent access exceptions.  ¡	It doesn’t depend on any external device to work. It won’t hang because some external  device  whether database, filesystem, or network  is unavailable, too slow, or broken.  Figure 1.3 illustrates the difference between a referentially transparent program and  one that’s not referentially transparent.  1.2   The benefits of safe programming From what I’ve described, you can likely guess the many benefits you can expect by  using referential transparency:  ¡	Your programs will be easier to reason about because they’ll be deterministic. A specific  input will always give the same output. In many cases, you might be able to prove  a program correct rather than to extensively test it and still remain uncertain  about whether it’ll break under unexpected conditions.

Its result only depends on its argument.  Objects  Exception  Keyboard  Screen  A program that isn’t referentially transparent may read data from or write it to elements in the outside world, log to file, mutate external objects, read from keyboard, print to screen, and so on. Its result is unpredictable.

Your programs will be more modular. That’s because they’ll be built from functions that only have input and output; there are no side effects to handle, no excep- tions to catch, no context mutation to deal with, no shared mutable state, and no concurrent modifications. To write a program, you start Composition and recombination of programs is much easier. by writing the various base functions you’ll need and then combine these func- tions into higher-level ones, repeating the process until you have a single function corresponding to the program you want to build. And, because all these functions                                             8  chapter 1  Making programs safer  1.2.1  Using the substitution model to reason about programs  are referentially transparent, they can then be reused to build other programs  without any modifications.  ¡	Your programs will be inherently thread-safe because they avoid mutation of shared states.  This doesn’t mean that all data has to be immutable, only shared data must be.  But programmers applying these techniques soon realize that immutable data is  always safer, even if the mutation is not visible externally. One reason is that data  that’s not shared at one point can become shared accidentally after refactoring.  Always using immutable data ensures that this kind of problem never happens.  In the rest of this chapter, I’ll present some examples of using referential transparency  to write safer programs.  The main benefit from using functions that return a value without any other observ- able effect is that they’re equivalent to their return value. Such a function doesn’t do  anything. It has a value, which is dependent only on its arguments. As a consequence,  it’s always possible to replace a function call or any referentially transparent expression  with its value, as figure 1.4 shows.  When applied to functions, the substitution model lets you replace any function call   with its return value. Consider the following code: fun main args: Array   {     val x = add mult 2, 3 , mult 4, 5       println x  } fun add a: Int, b: Int : Int {     log String.format "Returning ${a + b} as the result of $a + $b"       return a + b } fun mult a: Int, b: Int  = a * b fun log m: String  {     println m  }  Replacing  mult 2,  3   and  mult 4,  5   with  their  respective  return  values  doesn’t  change the signification of the program.

This may or may not be important; in any case, it changes the out- come of the program.  1.2.2  Applying safe principles to a simple example  To convert an unsafe program into a safer one, let’s consider a simple example repre- senting the purchase of a donut with a credit card.  Listing 1.1    A Kotlin program with side effects  fun buyDonut creditCard: CreditCard : Donut {     val donut = Donut       creditCard.charge donut.price          return donut                       }  Charges the credit card as a side effect  Returns the donut  In this code, charging the credit card is a side effect. Charging a credit card probably consists of calling the bank, verifying that the credit card is valid and authorized, and registering the transaction. The function returns the donut.  The problem with this kind of code is that it’s difficult to test. Running the program testing  using for  some sort of mock account. Or you’d need to create a mock credit card to register the effect of calling the  function and to verify the state of the mock after the test.  transaction   registering   contacting   involve   would   charge  bank   and   the   the   If you want to be able to test your program without contacting the bank or using a side effect. But because you still want to charge the credit mock, you should remove the card, the only solution is to add a representation of this operation to the return value. function will have to return both the donut and this representation of Your the payment. To represent the payment, you can use a class, as shown in the following listing.  buyDonut  Payment  Listing 1.2       The  Payment  class  class Payment val creditCard: CreditCard, val amount: Int   This class credit  both a class Purchase val donut: Donut, val payment: Payment   contains the necessary data to represent the payment, which consists of a return Purchase.

That’s much less useful in Kotlin because the same result  can be obtained with a single line of code: data class Purchase val donut: Donut, val payment: Payment   The Purchase class already doesn’t need an explicit constructor and getters. By adding  the data keyword in front of the class definition, Kotlin additionally provides imple- mentations of equals, hashCode, toString, and copy. But you must accept the default  implementations. Two instances of a data class will be equal if all properties are equal.  If  this  isn’t  what  you  need,  you  can  override  any  of  these  functions  with  your  own  implementations. fun buyDonut creditCard: CreditCard : Purchase {     val donut = Donut       val payment = Payment creditCard, Donut.price      return Purchase donut, payment  }  You’re  no  longer  concerned  at  this  stage  with  how  the  credit  card  will  be  charged.  This adds some freedom to the way you build your application. You could process the  payment immediately, or you could store it for later processing. You can even combine  stored payments for the same card and process them in a single operation. This would  save you some money by minimizing the bank fees for the credit card service.  The combine function in listing 1.3 is used to combine payments. If the credit cards  don’t match, an exception is thrown. This doesn’t contradict what I said about safe  programs not throwing exceptions. Here, trying to combine two payments with two  different credit cards is considered a bug, so it should crash the application.  This isn’t  realistic. You’ll have to wait until chapter 7 to learn how to deal with such situations  without throwing exceptions.   Listing 1.3    Composing multiple payments into a single one  package com.fpinkotlin.introduction.listing03 class Payment val creditCard: CreditCard, val amount: Int  {     fun combine payment: Payment : Payment =         if  creditCard == payment.creditCard              Payment creditCard, amount + payment.amount          else             throw IllegalStateException "Cards don't match."  }  In this scenario, the combine function wouldn’t be efficient when buying several donuts  at once. For this you could replace the buyDonut function with buyDonuts n:  Int,  creditCard: CreditCard  as shown in the following listing, but you need to define a  new Purchase class. Alternatively, if you had chosen to use a Pair ,  you’d have to replace it with Pair , Payment>.

With the new version, however, you can choose to charge the card  immediately for each purchase or to group all payments made with the same card and  charge it only once for the total. To group payments, you’ll need to use additional  functions from the Kotlin List class:  ¡	groupBy f:  A  -> B : Map > —Takes as its parameter a function  from A to B and returns a map of keys and value pairs, with keys being of type B  and values of type List . You’ll use it to group payments by credit cards.  ¡	values: List  —An instance function of Map that returns a list of all the values   in the map.  ¡	map f:  A  -> B : List  —An instance function of List that takes a function   from A to B and applies it to all elements of a list of A, returning a list of B.  ¡	reduce f:  A, A  -> A : A —A function of List that uses an operation  rep- resented by a function f:  A, A  -> A  to reduce the list to a single value. The  operation could be, for example, addition. In such a case, it would mean a func- tion such as f a, b  = a + b.  Using these functions, you can now create a new function that groups payments by  credit card, as shown in the next listing.  Listing 1.5    Grouping payments by credit card  Changes List  into a Map<CreditCard,  List >, where each list contains all  payments for a particular credit card  package com.fpinkotlin.introduction.listing05; class Payment val creditCard: CreditCard, val amount: Int  {     fun combine payment: Payment : Payment =         if  creditCard == payment.creditCard              Payment creditCard, amount + payment.amount          else             throw IllegalStateException "Cards don't match."      companion object {         fun groupByCard payments: List  : List  =             payments.groupBy { it.creditCard }                                 .values                                                         .map { it.reduce Payment::combine  }       } }  Changes the Map >   into a List >  Reduces each List  into a single Payment,  leading to the overall result of a List   Note the use of a function reference in the last line of the groupByCard function. Func- tion references are similar to method references in Java. If this example isn’t clear,  well, that’s what this book is for! When you reach the end, you’ll be an expert in com- posing such code.   The benefits of safe programming     13  1.2.3  Pushing abstraction to the limit  As you’ve seen, you can write safer programs that are easier to test by composing pure  functions, which mean functions without side effects. You can declare these functions  using the fun keyword or as value functions, such as the arguments of methods groupBy,  map, or reduce in the previous listing. Value functions are functions represented in such  a way that, unlike fun functions, they can be manipulated by the program. In most  cases, you can use these as arguments to other functions or as values returned by other  functions. You’ll learn how this is done in the following chapters.  But the most important concept here is abstraction. Look at the reduce function. It  takes as its argument an operation, and uses that operation to reduce a list to a single  value. Here the operation has two operands of the same type. Except for this, it could  be any operation.  Consider a list of integers. You could write a sum function to compute the sum of the  elements. Then you could write a product function to compute the product of the ele- ments or a min or a max function to compute the minimum or the maximum of the list.  Alternatively, you could also use the reduce function for all these computations. This is  abstraction. You abstract the part that’s common to all operations in the reduce func- tion, and you pass the variable part  the operation  as an argument.  You could go further. The reduce function is a particular case of a more general  function that might produce a result of a different type than the elements of the list.  For example, it could be applied to a list of characters to produce a String. You’d need  to start from a given value  probably an empty string . In chapters 3 and 5, you’ll learn  how to use this function, called fold.  The reduce function won’t work on an empty list. Think of a list of integers—if you  want to compute the sum, you need to have an element to start with. If the list is empty,  what should you return? You know that the result should be 0, but this only works for a  sum. It won’t work for a product.  Also consider the groupByCard function. It looks like a business function that can  only be used to group payments by credit cards. But it’s not! You could use this function  to group the elements of any list by any of their properties. This function then should  be abstracted and put inside the List class in such a way that it could be reused easily.   It’s defined in the Kotlin List class.   Pushing abstraction to the limits allows making programs safer because the abstracted  part will only be written once. As a consequence, once it’s fully tested, there’ll be no risk  of producing new bugs by reimplementing it.  In the rest of this book, you’ll learn how to abstract many things so you’ll only have  to define them once. You will, for example, learn how to abstract loops so you won’t  ever need to write loops again. And you’ll learn how to abstract parallelization in a  way that’ll let you switch from serial to parallel processing by selecting a function in  the List class.   14  chapter 1  Making programs safer  Summary  ¡	You can make programs safer by clearly separating functions, which return val-  ues, from effects, which interact with the outside world.  ¡	Functions are easier to reason about and to test because their outcome is deter-  ministic and doesn’t depend on an external state.  ¡	Pushing abstraction to a higher level improves safety, maintainability, testability,   and reusability.  ¡	Applying safe principles like immutability and referential transparency protects  programs against accidental sharing of a mutable state, which is a huge source of  bugs in multithreaded environments.   2Functional programming in   Kotlin: An overview  In this chapter ¡	Declaring and initializing fields and variables ¡	Kotlin’s classes and interfaces ¡	Kotlin’s two types of collections ¡	Functions  and control structures  ¡	Handling nulls  In this chapter, I provide a quick overview of the Kotlin language. I assume that you  know a bit  at least  of Java, so I stress the differences between the two languages.  The intent is not to teach you Kotlin. You’ll find other books for this. If you need an  in-depth coverage of Kotlin, I recommend you read Dmitry Jemerov and Svetlana  Isakova’s Kotlin in Action  Manning, 2017 .  This chapter gives you a first glimpse of what to expect from Kotlin. Don’t try to  remember everything. Look at some of the astounding features of the Kotlin lan- guage and see how it differs from Java. In the following chapters, I come back to each  feature, used in a safe programming context. In the rest of this chapter, I give you  an overview of the most important benefits of using Kotlin. This presentation is cer- tainly not exhaustive, and you’ll discover additional benefits in the rest of the book.  15   16  2.1   chapter  2     Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  Kotlin, fields are declared and initialized using the following syntax:  Fields and variables in Kotlin In val name: String = "Mickey"  Note the differences with Java:  ¡  ¡  ¡  val  name  in Java .  comes first and means that the final  The keyword  corresponding to The type  String  comes after the name, separated by a There’s no semicolon  ;  at the end of the line.

This is annoying because Kotlin allows you to differentiate between nullable and non-nullable types. Non-nullable types are much safer because there’s no risk of a the value isn’t known at declaration time, and will never change after initialization, it would be sad to be forced to use for such a use case. That would force you to use a nullable type instead of a non-nullable one, for example: var name: String? = null  NullPointerException. When  var     name = getName    Here the reference is of type String?, which is nullable, although it could be of type String, which isn’t.

In case you absolutely need a  lazy mutable reference, you can use the lateinit keyword, which has somewhat the  same effect, although without the automatic on-demand initialization: lateinit var name: String  This construction avoids using a nullable type. But it offers absolutely no benefit com- pared  to  by  lazy  except  when  initialization  should  be  done  externally,  such  as  when  using a dependency injection framework while working with properties. Note that con- structor-based dependency injection should always be preferred because it allows using  immutable properties. As you’ll see in chapter 9, there’s much more to learn about laziness.  2.2  Classes and interfaces in Kotlin  Classes in Kotlin are created with a somewhat different syntax than those in Java. A  class Person with a property name of type String can be declared in Kotlin as class Person constructor name: String  {      val name: String      init {         this.name = name     } }  This is equivalent to the following Java code: public final class Person {      private final String name;      public Person String name  {         this.name = name;     }      public String getName   {         return name;     } }   Classes and interfaces in Kotlin     19  As you can see, the Kotlin version is more compact. Note some particularities:  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  final  internal  internal  private,  modifier. In  protected, or  class non-public, you can use the  Java, most classes should be declared  public. To make A Kotlin class is public by default, so there’s no need for the word modifiers. a modifier means that the class is accessible only from inside the The module where it’s defined. There’s no Kotlin equivalent for "package private"  corresponding to the absence of a modifier  in Java. Unlike Java, is protected restricted to extending classes and doesn’t include classes in the same package. A Kotlin class is final by default, so the equivalent Java class would be declared with the but pro- grammers often forget to do that. Kotlin solves this problem by making classes modifier. This is final much safer because classes opened for extension should be specifically designed for this. The constructor is declared after the class name, and its implementation is in an init Accessors Unlike Java, public classes need not be defined in a file with the name of the class. You can name the file as you like. Furthermore, you can define several public classes in the same file. But this doesn’t mean you should do so. Having each pub- lic class in a separate file with the name of the class makes finding things easier.    aren’t needed. They’re generated when you compile the code.  block.

And you can also remove the word class Person  val name: String    whether the block is empty or not :  constructor  Additionally, you can create several properties for the same class: class Person val name: String, val registered: Instant   As you can see, Kotlin removes most of the boilerplate code, resulting in concise code that’s  times.

The difference is that the extended class name is followed by the parameter names enclosed in parentheses: class Member name: String, registered: Instant  : Person name, registered   Remember, however, that classes are final by default. For this example to compile, the extended class must be declared open class Person val name: String, val registered: Instant   open, which means  open for extension:  A good programming practice is to allow extension only for classes that have been spe- cifically designed for it. As you can see, Kotlin, unlike Java, tries to enforce this princi- ple by not letting you extend a class if it hasn’t been designed for extension.  2.2.3   Instantiating a class When although to a lesser extent. For example, instead of writing final Person person = new Person "Bob", Instant.now   ;  instance   creating   Kotlin   spares   class,   you   an   of   a   you can use the constructor as a function  which it is, indeed : val person = Person "Bob", Instant.now     from   repetitious   typing,  This makes sense because the constructor is a function from the set of all possi- ble pairs of strings and instants to the set of all possible persons. Now let’s look at how Kotlin handles overloading those constructors.  Person  2.2.4   Overloading property constructors Sometimes, a property is optional and has a default value. In the previous example, you could decide that the date of registration defaults to the date of creation of the instance. In Java, you’d have to write two constructors as indicated in the following listing.  Listing 2.1       A typical Java object with an optional property  public final class Person {  private final String name;  private final Instant registered;  public Person String name, Instant registered  {                                                               Classes and interfaces in Kotlin     21          this.name = name;         this.registered = registered;     }      public Person String name  {         this name, Instant.now   ;     }      public String getName   {         return name;     }      public Instant getRegistered   {         return registered;     } }  In Kotlin, you can obtain the same result by indicating the default value after the prop- erty name: class Person val name: String, val registered: Instant = Instant.now     You can also override constructors in a more traditional way: class Person val name: String, val registered: Instant = Instant.now    {       }  constructor name: Name  : this name.toString    {      optional constructor implementation may be added }  As in Java, if you don’t declare a constructor, a constructor without arguments is auto- matically generated. private constructors and properties As in Java, you can make constructors private to prevent instantiation by external code: class Person private constructor val name: String   But, unlike Java, private constructors aren’t needed to prevent instantiation of utility  classes containing only static members. Kotlin puts static members at the package level,  outside of any class. accessors and properties In Java, it’s considered bad practice to expose object properties directly. Instead, you  make those visible through methods that get and set property values. These methods  are  conveniently  called  getters  and  setters  and  referred  to  as  accessors.  The  following  example calls a getter for the name of a person: val person = Person "Bob"  ... println person.name     Calling the getter  Although it looks like you’re accessing the name field directly, you’re using a gener- ated getter.

To get the same effect, you’ll have to use a  val registered: Instant = Instant.now    {  companion object {  fun create xml: String : Person {                                                                                                                                               24  chapter  2     Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  TODO "Write an implementation creating " +  "a Person from an xml string"   }  }  }  function  The create ods in Java: Person.create someXmlString   can be called on the enclosing class as you’d do with static meth-  You can also call it explicitly on the companion object, but this is redundant: Person.Companion.create someXmlString     @JvmStatic  On the other hand, if you use this function from Java code, you need to call it on the com- panion object. To be able to call it on the class, you must annotate the Kotlin function with the annotation. For more information about calling Kotlin functions from Java code  and the other way round , see appendix A. TODO  function, which makes your code much more consistent. This method throws an exception at runtime, reminding you about the work that should have been done!  Incidentally, you can see that Kotlin offers a  2.2.8   Using singletons often necessary to create a single instance of a given class. Such an instance is called It’s a singleton. The singleton pattern is a technique used to guarantee that there’s possibly only one instance of a class. In Java, it’s a controversial pattern because it’s difficult to guarantee that only one instance can be created. In Kotlin, a singleton can be easily created by replacing the word object MyWindowAdapter: WindowAdapter   {  with the word  object:  class  override fun windowClosed e: WindowEvent?  {  TODO "not implemented"   }  }  2.2.9   An object can’t have constructors. If it has properties, those must either be initialized or abstract.  Preventing utility class instantiation In Java, it’s common usage to create utility classes that contain only static methods. In such cases, you usually want to forbid class instantiation. The Java solution is to create a private constructor. In Kotlin, this is possible, but useless. That’s because, with Kotlin, you can create functions outside of classes at the package level. To do that, create a file with any name and start with a package declaration. You can then define functions without putting them into classes: package com.acme.util  fun create xml: String : Person {  ...  }                                                         Kotlin’s two types of collections     25  You can call such a function with its full name: val person = com.acme.util.create someXmlString   Alternatively, you can import the package and use only the function’s short name: import com.acme.util.*  val person = create someXmlString   Because Kotlin runs on the JVM, there must be a way to call package-level functions from Java code. This is described in appendix A.  2.3   Kotlin doesn’t have primitives Kotlin has no primitives, at least not at the programmer level. Instead, it uses Java prim- itives under the hood to make computation faster. But you, as the programmer, will only be manipulating objects. The object class for integers is different than the object representation  The other numerical and Boolean types have the same names as in Java. Also, as in Java, you can use underscores in numbers:  Integer,   integers   Instead   you’ll   class.

In fact, Kotlin immutable collections aren’t really immutable. They’re NOTE only collections that you can’t mutate. As a consequence, some prefer to call read- them aren’t  only either. Let’s not worry about this. In chapter 5, you’ll learn to create   true immutable collections.  collections,   read-only   because   better   which   much   they   isn’t                                                                                                                                  26  chapter  2     Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  or   class   listOf an   function is  interface.   package-level  The a  defined  import it using the following syntax: import kotlin.collections.listOf  a  It’s   in   function,   which   means  kotlin.collections  the  that  it’s  package   not  so   part  you   of can  to   have   don’t   You  from  implicitly imported as if you were using the following import: import kotlin.collections.*  explicitly.   functions   import   All   it   this   package   are,   in   fact,  Many other packages are also automatically imported. This mechanism is similar to the automatic import of the  package in Java.  java.lang  Note that immutable doesn’t mean that you can’t do any operations with these lists,  for example: val list1 = listOf 1, 2, 3  val list2 = list1 + 4 val list3 = list1 + list2 println list1  println list2  println list3   This code creates a list containing integers 1, 2, and 3. Then it creates a new list by add- ing an element to the first one. Finally, it creates another new list again, concatenating the two existing lists. As the result shows, no one list has been modified: [1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3, 4] [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]  If you need mutable collections, you have to specify them: val list1 = mutableListOf 1, 2, 3  val list2 = list1.add 4  val list3 = list1.addAll list1  println list1  println list2  println list3   The result is totally different: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4] true true  Boolean  to the references. These references were automatically made  Here, all operations were made on the first list and are then cumulative. Due to type inference, no error occurred when assigning the result of the operation  which is of type   Boolean by Kotlin. This is a good reason to explicitly write the expected type. It would prevent the following code from compiling: val list1: List  = mutableListOf 1, 2, 3  val list2: List  = list1.add 1     <-- Compile error val list3: List  = list1.addAll list2     <-- Compile error println list1  println list2  println list3                                                                                                                      2.5  Kotlin’s packages  Visibility in Kotlin     27  The + operator is an infix extension function called plus, which Kotlin declares in the  Collection interface that List extends. It’s translated into a static function creating  a new list from its arguments. You can use the + operator with mutable lists, and you’ll  get the same result as if the lists where immutable, leaving the lists unchanged.  If you’re aware of how immutable persistent data structures are usually implemented  with data sharing, you may be disappointed to learn that Kotlin’s immutable lists don’t  share data.  They share elements, but not the list data.  Adding an element to a list  implies constructing a whole new list. In chapter 5, you’ll learn how to create your own  immutable list that implements data sharing, which lets you save memory space and  obtain better performance on some operations.  You already saw that functions can be declared at the package level, which is an import- ant difference from the way Java uses packages. Another particularity of Kotlin packages  is that they don’t have to correspond to the directory structure where they’re stored.  In the same way, classes don’t need to be defined in files by the same names; package  organization in the containing directory structure isn’t mandatory. Packages are only  identifiers. There’s no notion of a subpackage  packages containing packages . Filenames  are irrelevant  as long as they have a .kt extension . This said, it’s a good idea to adopt  the Java convention based on the package directory correspondence for two reasons:  1  If you need to mix Java and Kotlin files, you’ll have to put the Java files into direc-  tories matching the package names. You should do the same with Kotlin files.  2  Even if you create only Kotlin source files, finding a source file will be much eas- ier. You only need to look at the package  generally indicated by an import  and  convert it to a file path.  2.6   Visibility in Kotlin Visibility is somewhat different from what it is in Java. Functions and properties can be  defined at the package level, not only in classes. All elements defined at the package  level are public by default. If an element is declared private, it’s only visible from inside  the same file.  An element can also be declared internal, meaning it’s only visible from inside the   same module. A module is a set of files compiled together, such as  ¡	A Maven project ¡	A Gradle source set ¡	An IntelliJ module ¡	An Eclipse project ¡	A group of files compiled with a single Ant task  A module is intended to be packed into a single jar file. A module can include several  packages, and a single package can spread over several modules.   28  chapter  2     Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  Classes and interfaces have a public visibility by default. They can also be affected by  one of the following visibility modifiers:  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  private protected internal public     private  element is only visible from inside the class where it’s defined. In Java, the A private members of an  a class defined inside another class  aren’t visible from the outer class.

You can specify the visibility level for these  constructors as shown here: class Person private constructor  val name: String,  val registered: Instant   visibility  the default visibility in Java . On the Unlike Java, Kotlin has no other hand, the element can be internal accessed from any code in the same module.  Note that code in a Gradle test source set can access internal elements of the corresponding main source set.   package private visibility is specific to Kotlin. An  internal  2.7   Functions in Kotlin A function in Kotlin is equivalent to a method in Java. This isn’t the same meaning as a function in math or in functional programming.

For the rest of this chapter, I’ll use function in the Kotlin sense  meaning as equivalent to a Java method .  function  2.7.1   Kotlin   properties,   Declaring functions Like classes  or  example: fun add a: Int, b: Int : Int {  you  Functions   can  are   objects.   return a + b  }  declare  introduced   Kotlin  by   functions  the   at  keyword  the  fun  package  as   in   the   or   in level  following  When the body can be expressed as a single line, the block delimited with can be replaced with the following syntax: fun add a: Int, b: Int : Int = a + b  curly braces  using this syntax, you can omit the return type  expression syntax.

In such an example, using an explicit return type allows the compiler to warn you about the error  although you can’t use  in this example .  return  be   can   and   inside   classes   defined   Using local functions Functions be declared inside other functions. The following code is an example of a somewhat com- plex function returning the number of divisors of an integer. For now, you don’t have to understand how this function works. We’ll get to that in the next chapters. But the important fact to note is that the function definition contains the defini- tion of the fun sumOfPrimes limit: Int : Long {  Furthermore,   sumOfPrimes  function:  objects.   isPrime  they   also   can   val seq: Sequence  = sequenceOf 2L  +  generateSequence 3L, {  fun isPrime n: Long : Boolean =  it + 2  } .takeWhile{  it < limit  seq.takeWhile {  it * it <= n  }.all {  n % it != 0L  }  }  return seq.filter ::isPrime .sum    }  variable. Such a  isPrime the  function can’t be defined outside the construct is called a seq  function because it The sumOfPrimes closes over closure. As you’ll learn in the next chapter, closures cause the closed-over variable s  to be part of the function argument. This code is equivalent to the following: fun sumOfPrimes limit: Int : Long {  val seq: Sequence  = sequenceOf 2L  +  generateSequence 3L, {  it + 2  } .takeWhile{  it < limit  }  return seq.filter {  x -> isPrime x, seq   }.sum    }                                                                                                 30  chapter  2     Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  fun isPrime n: Long, seq: Sequence  : Boolean =  seq.takeWhile {  it * it <= n  }.all {  n % it != 0L  }  isPrime  Using a closure lets you use a function reference  equivalent to a Java method refer- function.

Kotlin uses this mechanism frequently. Let’s say you want to define fun   length list: List   = list.size  function that gives the length of a list like this:  length  a  This is, of course, totally useless, but it’s just an example. Kotlin lets you define this function as fun   List .length   = this.size  length  In this example, is an extension function because it extends the by adding a function that can be used as if it were an instance function: fun   List .length   = this.size  List  interface  val ints = listOf 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7   val listLength = ints.length    size  function, which can be called with the property syntax, parentheses Unlike the are mandatory when calling length  . Additionally, such extension functions can’t be called as instance methods from Java code; it must be called as a static method. With Kotlin, it’s even possible to add functions to parameterized classes such as fun List .product  : Int = this.fold 1  { a, b -> a * b }                                                                                                                         2.7.5   Functions in Kotlin     31  val ints = listOf 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7   val product = ints.product    As you can see, extension functions are just like static functions in Java. But instead of being called on a class, they can be called on an instance, letting you chain function calls instead of embedding one in another.  Java,  lambdas  in aren’t   Using lambdas meaning  Like  that  Kotlin  than Java syntax, though.

In the example, the lambda is not only the last argument, but the only one, so the parentheses  the arguments of the lambda don’t need to be put between parentheses.

This is done on purpose to speed up compilation. When inferring the correct types could potentially take too much time, Kotlin gives up, and it’s up to you to specify the parameter types. Here’s how to do this: fun List .product  : Int = this.fold 1  { a: Int, b: Int -> a * b }  the   you   and   types   often   avoid   might   specifying   Although  inference, you’ll soon realize that there’s another way to benefit.

The previous  map  But it might not always be wise to use this syntax. It’s often a good simplification to use when lambdas aren’t nested; otherwise, it might become difficult to guess what is! In any case, a good practice is to write lambdas on several lines: fun triple list: List  : List  = list.map {  it  it * 3  a * 3  }  }  fun triple list: List  : List  = list.map { a ->  Splitting the line after the arrow  ->  makes it clear which syntax you’re using. Lambdas     in cLosures Like val multiplier = 3  Java, Kotlin allows for lambdas to close over variables in the enclosing scope:  fun multiplyAll list: List  : List  = list.map { it * multiplier }  Be aware that closures should generally be replaced with function arguments, which makes your code safer. Take this example, for instance: fun multiplyAll list: List , multiplier: int : List  = list.map { it * multiplier }  list.map { it * multiplier }  You should use a closure only when it closes over a narrow scope  for example, in func- tions defined inside other functions . In such cases, it might be safe to close over the arguments or the temporary result of the enclosing function. Unlike Java, Kotlin allows closing  variables.  using mutable references in any case.  programs,   mutable   avoid   write   safer   want   over   you   But   to   if   Nulls in Kotlin Kotlin ref- erences are one of the most frequent sources of bugs in computer programs.

Take the exam- ple of integers. To represent integers in the range [–2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647], Int.

The most interesting part of the story is that any non-nullable type is a  child type of the corresponding nullable type, so the following is correct: val x: Int = 3 val y: Int? = x  But this is not: val x: Int? = 3 val y: Int = x  2.8.1  Dealing with nullable types  When  using  non-nullable  types,  you  can’t  throw  a  NullPointerException.  On  the  other hand, if you use nullable types, you can get a NullPointException. Kotlin forces  you to handle the exception or to take full responsibility. The following code won’t  compile: val s: String? = someFunctionReturningAStringThatCanBeNull   val l = s.length  The dot . operator, also called the dereferencing operator, can’t be used here because  it could cause an NPE  NullPointerException . What you might want to do instead  is this: val s: String? = someFunctionReturningAStringThatCanBeNull   val l = if  s != null  s.length else null  Kotlin simplifies this use case thanks to the safe call operator, ?.: val s: String? = someFunctionReturningAStringThatCanBeNull   val l = s?.length  Note that Kotlin infers the type of l to be Int?. This syntax, however, is more practical  when chaining calls: val city: City? = map[companyName]?.manager?.address?.city  In such cases, the companyName could be absent from the map, or it could have no man- ager, or the manager could have no address, or the city could be missing. Null safety  could  be  obtained  by  nesting  if...else  constructs,  but  the  Kotlin  syntax  is  much  more convenient. It’s also more compact than the equivalent Java solution: City city = Optional.ofNullable map.get companyName                       .flatMap Company::getManager                      .flatMap Employee::getAddress                      .flatMap Address::getCity                      .getOrElse null ;  As I mentioned, Kotlin also offers you the opportunity to take full responsibility for  throwing NPEs: val city: City? = map[companyName]!!.manager!!.address!!.city  With this syntax, if anything is null  except for the city , an NPE will be thrown.   34  2.8.2   2.9   chapter  2     Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  Elvis and the default value Sometimes, Java val city: City = map[company]?.manager?.address?.city ?: City.UNKOWN  you’ll want to use a specific default value instead of  allows.

As you’ll see in the next chapters, control structures are a major source of bugs in computer programs, so you should avoid them as much as possible. You’ll see that it’s possible to write much safer programs by totally avoiding the use of control structures. Primarily, you can ignore the notion of control flow. You replace control structures with expressions and functions. Unlike some languages specifically designed to pro- mote safe programming, Kotlin has both control structures  like Java  and functions that can be used to replace those structures. But some of these control structures are, in fact, different from their Java versions.  basis  to  is   are   2.9.1   Java, the  if...else  Using conditional selectors In the program flow to execute one of two blocks of instructions, the condition holds. Here’s a simple Java example: int a = ... int b = ...  construct is a control structure. It tests a condition and directs depending on whether  if  a < b  {  } else {  System.println "a is smaller than b" ;  System.println "a is not smaller than b" ;  if...else  In Kotlin, the construct is an expression that can be evaluated to a value. It has the same form as in Java, although it returns the value in the first block if the condi- tion holds. If not, it returns the value in the second block: val a: Int = ... val b: Int = ...  }  }  val s = if  a < b  {  "a is smaller than b"  } else {  "a is not smaller than b"  println s                                                                                                                                    Program flow and control structures     35  Like Java, you can omit the curly braces if the blocks have only one line: val a: Int = ... val b: Int = ...  val s = if  a < b   "a is smaller than b"  else  "a is not smaller than b"  println s   if  without a corresponding  Although this is often considered bad practice in Java, it’s not in Kotlin. If the braces are omitted, there can’t be an clause. Mistakenly add- ing a line to a branch without adding the curly braces would not compile. When the branches of the expression comprise several lines, however, they must be enclosed in blocks  like in Java . In this case, the val a: Int = 6 val b: Int = 5  keyword shouldn’t be used:  if...else  return  else  val percent = if  b != 0  {  val temp = a   b temp * 100  } else {  0  }  Here, the first branch has two lines, so it’s enclosed in a block. The value of the block is the value of the expression on the last line of the block. Braces delimiting the second block aren’t mandatory because it has only one line. For consistency and readability, programmers generally use braces for the two branches even if only one of them needs the braces.  if  It’s possible to add effects in the  block, making this function much more like the Java control structure. But avoid this practice as much as possible. In the previous chap- ter, I said that effects should be used only in delimited, “non-safe” parts of the program. Outside of these parts, you should only use the function as an expression, with no side effects.  if...else  2.9.2   are   more   there   Using multi-conditional selectors When structure. This lets you test for integer values, enums, or strings:    Java code String country = ...

You don’t have to use a break  at the end of each case. As with the if...then expression, you shouldn’t use effects in  these blocks.  One important thing to note is that Kotlin won’t let you use a non-exhaustive when.  All possible cases must be handled. If using an enum, you can create one case for each  possible value of the enum. If you add a new value later to the enum, and the when code  isn’t updated to handle that value, the code will no longer compile.  The else case is  the simplest way to handle all cases.  You can also use the when construct with a different  syntax: val country = ...  val capital = when {     tired                  -> "Check for yourself"     country == "Australia" -> "Canberra"     country == "Bolivia"   -> "Sucre"     country == "Brazil"    -> "Brasília"     else                   -> "Unknown" }  Using the when construct this way can be useful if not all of the conditions depend on  the same argument. In the previous example, tired is a Boolean value that was ini- tialized somewhere else. If it’s true, the value to the right of the corresponding arrow  is returned. Conditions are tested in the order they’re listed. The first condition that  holds determines the value of the expression.  2.9.3  Using loops  Java uses several kinds of loops:  ¡	Indexed loops, iterating over a range of numerical values ¡	Loops iterating over a collection of values ¡	Loops iterating as long as a condition holds   Kotlin’s unchecked exceptions     37  Kotlin also has similar control structures. The while loop in Kotlin is like its Java coun- terpart. It’s a control structure and is used if you want your program to describe how  things should be done. This comes with a responsibility. If your description of how  things should be done is inaccurate, your program will be wrong or buggy, even if your  intention was correct. That’s why it’s safer to replace control structures with functions  saying what should be done  not how it should be done .  Indexed loops also exist in Kotlin, although an indexed loop is, in fact, an iteration   over a collection of indexes: for i in 0 until 10 step 2  {    println i  }  This is equivalent to val range = 0 until 10 step 2 for  i in range  println i   2.10  Kotlin’s unchecked exceptions  This control structure iterates over a range of indexes. Kotlin offers three main func- tions for creating ranges. until builds an ascending range, using a default step 1 or  an explicit step. The starting value is included, whereas the ending value is excluded.  until and step are functions of Int and can be used as shown here: for  i in 0.until 10 .step 2   println i   Like many other functions, they can also be used with infix notation: for  i in 0 until 10 step 2  println i   Two  other  useful  functions  for  creating  ranges  are  the  ..  operator   two  consecutive  dots , which is like until but includes the upper bounds, and downTo, for descending  ranges. For safer programming, you shouldn’t use ranges with for loops but with special  functions that abstract iterations, such as fold. You’ll learn more about this in chapter 4.  Unlike Java, Kotlin has no checked exceptions. All exceptions are unchecked. This is  in line with what most Java programmers do nowadays: wrapping checked exceptions  into unchecked ones. Beside this, the main difference between Kotlin and Java is that  the try..catch..finally construct is an expression returning a value. You can use it  like this: val num: Int = try {     args[0].toInt   } catch  e: Exception  {     0 } finally {        Code in this block is always executed }  As you already saw with if...else, the value returned by each block is the result of eval- uating the last line of the block. The difference is that for the try...catch...finally,    38  chapter 2  Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  braces are mandatory. The value returned is either the result of the evaluation of the last  line of the try block, if there’s no exception, or the evaluation of the last line of the catch  block otherwise.  2.11  Automatic resource closure  Kotlin is able to automatically close resources in the same way as Java does with the try  with resource construct, provided these resources implement either Closable or Auto- Closable. The main difference is that to achieve this, Kotlin offers the use function: File "myFile.txt" .inputStream                     .use {                       it.bufferedReader                           .lineSequence                           .forEach  ::println          }  This  specific  code  is  only  an  example  of  automatically  handling  closable  resources.  It’s  not  of  great  interest  beside  this  because  the  lineSequence  function  returns  a  Sequence, which is a lazy construct. Lazy means that evaluation  reading the file lines   occurs only later, when the lines are used.  Outside of the use function block, the input stream must automatically close or the  sequence would be useless. This forces you to apply the effect  println\  immediately,  contradicting  safe  programming  principles.  The  following  code  will  compile,  but  it  throws an IOException: Stream Closed at runtime: val lines: Sequence  = File "myFile.txt"          .inputStream           .use {             it.bufferedReader                 .lineSequence           }  lines.forEach ::println   The solution is to force stream evaluation before exiting the block: val lines: List  = File "myFile.txt"          .inputStream           .use {             it.bufferedReader                 .lineSequence                 .toList           }  lines.forEach ::println   The main problem is that the whole file must be held in memory. By the way, if you  want to process the file as a sequence of lines, Kotlin offers a much simpler way to do  this, using the forEachLine function: File "myFile.txt" .forEachLine { println it  }   Kotlin’s smart casts     39  You can also use useLines, which returns a Sequence. The equivalent of the previous  example would be File "myFile.txt" .useLines{ it.forEach ::println  }  2.12  Kotlin’s smart casts  In Java, it’s sometimes necessary to cast a reference to some given type. As this might  produce a ClassCastException if the referenced object is not of the right type, you  must first check the type using the instanceof operator: Object payload = message.getPayload  ; int length = -1; if  payload intanceof String  {     String stringPayload =  String  payload;     length = stringPayload.length  ; }  This type of code is clumsy. In true object-oriented programming, checking the type  and casting is often considered bad practice. This might be the reason why not much  effort has been made to make casting easier to use. But Kotlin has a special technique  called smart casts. Here’s how you’d use a smart cast for the same example: val payload: Any = message.payload  val length: Int = if  payload is String      payload.length else     -1  This is called a smart cast because in the first branch of the if function, Kotlin knows  that payload is of type String, so it performs the cast automatically. You can also use  smart casts with the when function: val result: Int = when  payload  {         is String -> payload.length         is Int    -> payload         else      -> -1     }  Casting can also be done in a normal, unsafe way, using the as operator: val result: String = payload as String  If  the  object  isn’t  of  the  right  type,  a  ClassCastException  is  thrown.  Kotlin  offers  another safe syntax for these kinds of casts: val result: String? = payload as? String  If the cast doesn’t succeed, the result will be null instead of an exception. If you want  to write safer programs in Kotlin, you should avoid using the as? operator in the same  way you should avoid nullable types.   40  chapter 2  Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  2.13  Equality versus identity  One of the classical pitfalls in Java is the possible confusion between equality and iden- tity. This problem is made even trickier due to the presence of primitives, the fact that  strings are interned, and the way in which Integers are handled:    Java code int a = 2; System.out.println a == 2 ;    true Integer b = Integer.valueOf 1 ; System.out.println b == Integer.valueOf 1  ;    true System.out.println b == new Integer 1  ;    false System.out.println b.equals new Integer 1   ;    true Integer c = Integer.valueOf 512 ; System.out.println c == Integer.valueOf 512  ;    false System.out.println c.equals Integer.valueOf 512   ;    true String s = "Hello"; System.out.println s == "Hello" ;    true String s2 = "Hello, World!".substring 0, 5 ; System.out.println s2 == "Hello" ;    false System.out.println s2.equals "Hello"  ;    true  What  a  mess!   In  case  you  wonder  why  the  integers  b  and  c  behave  differently,  it’s  because Java returns a memoized shared version of integers for low values, so Integer. valueOf 1  always returns the same object, whereas Integer.valueOf 512  returns  a new distinct object on each call.  To be safe in Java, always test equality with equals  for objects and with == for primitives. The == symbol tests equality for primitives and  identity for objects.  Kotlin is simpler. Identity  also called referential equality  is tested with ===. Equality   sometimes called structural equality  is tested with ==, which is a shorthand for equals.  The simple fact that testing for equality  ==  is simpler than testing for identity  ===  will  prevent many mistakes. You can negate both == and === by replacing the first = with a !.  Kotlin offers a much simpler syntax than Java for mixing values with strings. In a previ- ous example, I used the + operator to construct a parameterized string, which is some- what impractical. A better form in Java would be to use the String.format   method,  such as    Java code System.out.println String.format "%s's registration date: %s",                                                     name, date  ;  Kotlin makes this much simpler: println "$name's registration date: $date"   Or you can also use expressions, provided they’re enclosed in curly braces: println "$name's registration date: ${date.atZone                                     ZoneId.of "America Los_Angeles"  }"   2.14  String interpolation   Variance: parameterized types and subtyping     41  This technique, called string interpolation, makes handling of strings much easier and  more readable.  2.15  Multi-line strings  Kotlin makes it easy to format multi-line strings by using the triple-quoted string  """   with the trimMargin function: println """This is the first line           and this is the second one.""".trimMargin     This code will print This is the first line and this is the second one.  The trimMargin function takes as an optional parameter, a string, to use as the margin  limit. As you can see in this example, the default value is "".  2.16  Variance: parameterized types and subtyping  Variance describes how parameterized types behave in relation to subtyping. Covariance  means that a Matcher  is considered a subtype of Matcher  if Red is a sub- type of Color. In such cases, Matcher  is said to be a covariant on T. If, on the con- trary, Matcher  is considered a subtype of Matcher , then Matcher  is  said to be a contravariant on T.  In Kotlin, you can indicate variance using the keywords in and out, which are shorter  and hopefully simpler to understand than covariant and contravariant.  The absence of  a keyword means invariant.   Think  about  a  List .  As  String  is  a  subtype  of  Any,  it’s  clear  that  a  List  could also be considered a List . In Java, which doesn’t handle  variance, one has to use wildcards for this.  2.16.1  Why is variance a potential problem?  An instance of String is an instance of Any, so you can write val s = "A String" val a: Any = s  This  is  because  Any  is  a  parent  of  String.  If  MutableList   was  a  parent  of  MutableList , you could write val ls = mutableListOf "A String"  val la: MutableList  = ls     <- compile error la.add 42   If this code compiled, you could insert an Int into a list of strings. This isn’t a problem  when using immutable lists. Adding an Int element to an immutable list of strings pro- duces a new list of type List , without changing the type of the original list: val ls = listOf "A String"  val la = ls + 42     ` for `la`   42  chapter 2  Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  is a parent type of List   and  A List  runtime .

As you may solution  the  to     2.16.2  Kotlin words for covariant and contravariant are  When to use covariance and when to use contravariance The and you have the following interface: interface Bag  {  out  fun get  : T  in, respectively. Suppose  as its argu-  and no function taking T is a super- reference, where V Bag  T. But you must specify your intention of making the type parameter covariant  As this interface has only a function returning ment , you could securely assign a type of keyword: by using the open class MyClassParent  T to any  Bag   out  class MyClass: MyClassParent    interface Bag  {  fun get  : T  }  }  }  }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Variance: parameterized types and subtyping     43  class BagImpl : Bag  {   override fun get  : MyClass = MyClass   }  val bag: Bag   = BagImpl    NOTE    If the type parameter can have an out variance and you don’t specify it, a  good IDE  such as IntelliJ  will warn you that you can make it covariant.  Conversely, if the interface only has functions taking arguments of type T and never  returning T, you can make the type parameter contravariant by using the keyword in: open class MyClassParent  class MyClass: MyClassParent    interface Bag  {   fun use t: T : Boolean }  class BagImpl : Bag  {   override fun use t: MyClassParent : Boolean = true }  val bag: Bag  = BagImpl    If neither in nor out is specified, the type is invariant. The choice of out and in is sim- ple if memorizing that covariance is used when the type is only output  return values ,  and contravariance is used when the type is only input  arguments .  2.16.3  Declaration-site variance versus use-site variance  As useful as a declaration-site variance can be, you’ll find many times when it can’t be  used. If the Bag interface both consumes and produces a type T, it can’t be variant: interface Bag  {    fun get  : T   fun use t: T : Boolean }  Parameter T can’t be made variant because it should be covariant for the method get  and contravariant for the method use. In this case, declaration-site variance can’t be  used. But it’s still possible to declare use-site variance. Consider the following useBag  function: open class MyClassParent  class MyClass: MyClassParent    interface Bag  {   fun get  : T   fun use t: T : Boolean }   44  chapter  2     Functional programming in Kotlin: An overview  class BagImpl : Bag  {  override fun get  : MyClassParent =  MyClassParent    override fun use t: MyClassParent : Boolean = true  fun useBag bag: Bag  : Boolean {     do something with bag return true  }  }  }  }  val bag3 = useBag BagImpl       <-- Compile error !  a   get   error   you’ll   because  compiler   and all you have is a  Here,    specify contravariance for because it would clash with the solution is to restrict the type on the use site: fun useBag bag: Bag  : Boolean {  get t: T   wants   useBag  Bag Bag .

Pure functions are easy to test, but pure effects aren’t. Is it possible to change this? Yes, it is, by treating effects in a different way. That’s what pure functional programming does. In this paradigm, everything is a function. Values are functions, functions are functions, and effects are functions. Instead of applying effects, functional programmers use func- tions returning data representing the intended effect in a non-evaluated form. In such a programming paradigm, everything is a function and everything is data because there’s no difference between data and functions.  a   if   not   using   you’re   difficult   language   techniques,   Why not simply use pure functional programming?

NOTE    The set of elements of the codomain that have a corresponding element  in the domain is called the image of the function.  Figure 3.1 illustrates a function. You can, for example, define the function f x  = x + 1  where x is a positive integer. This function represents the relationship between each  positive integer and its successor. You can give any name to this function. In particular,  you can give it a name that’ll help you to remember what it is, such as: successor x  = x + 1  This may seem like a good idea, but you shouldn’t blindly trust a function name.

Partial functions are important in programming because many bugs its codomain is are the result of using a partial function as if it were a total function. For example, the relation is a partial function from N to Q  the rational numbers  because it isn’t defined for 0. It’s a total function from N* to Q, but it’s also a total function from N to  Q plus error . By adding an element to the codomain  the error condition , you can transform the partial function into a total one. But to do this, the function needs a way to return an error. Can you see an analogy with computer programs? Later in this book, you’ll see that turning partial functions into total ones is an important part of safe programming.  3.1.4   Understanding function composition Functions position of functions and f   g  x  = f g x   = f x + 1  =  x + 1  * 2  g x  = x + 1, then  is noted as  and  are building blocks that can be composed to build other functions.

Simply put, there’s no such thing as a function of several arguments. Remember the definition of a function? A function is a relationship between a source set and a target set. It isn’t a relationship between two or more source sets and a target set. A function can’t have several arguments. But the product of two sets is itself a set. A function from such a product of sets into a set may seem like a function of several argu- ments. Let’s consider the following function: f x, y  = x + y  3.1.5                                                                                                                                        What’s a function?     51  N; in which case, it’s a function.

With the curried version, you’re considering both arguments separately. One of the arguments is considered first and applying the function to it gives you a new function. Is this new function useful by itself or is it simply a step in the global calculation?                                                                                                                                                         52  chapter    3  Programming with functions  In the case of an addition, currying doesn’t seem that useful. And, by the way, you could start with either of the two arguments and it’d make no difference. The interme- diate function would be different, but not the end result.  To help you understand the usefulness of currying, imagine you’re traveling in a foreign country, using a handheld calculator  or your smartphone  to convert from one currency to another. Would you prefer having to type the conversion rate each time you want to compute a price or would you rather put the conversion rate into memory? Which solution would be less error-prone? Consider a new function of a pair of values: f rate, price  = price   100 *  100 + rate   That function seems to be equivalent to this: g price, rate  = price   100 *  100 + rate   Let’s now consider the curried versions of these two functions: f rate  price  g price  rate   f  and  You know that those are the results of applying these results?  g  are functions. But what are f rate  to and g  g price ? Yes, for sure, price. But what are the types of  rate  and  to  f  f rate   g price   On the other hand,  is a function of a rate to a price. If  rate = 9, this function applies a tax of 9% to a price, returning a new price. You could call the resulting function apply9percent- Tax price , and it’d probably be a useful tool because the tax rate doesn’t change often. is a function of a rate to a price. If the price is $100, it gives a new function applying a price of $100 to a variable tax. It might not seem as useful, although this depends on the problem you need to solve. If the problem is to compute how much a fixed amount will grow given a variable interest rate, this version would be the more useful. f rate   are sometimes called partially-applied func- and g price, rate . Partially-applied tions, in reference to the forms functions can have huge consequences regarding argument evaluation. I’ll come back to this subject in section  g price  f rate, price   Functions like  3.2.4.  and  3.1.8   Functions have no effects that pure functions only return a value and do nothing else. They don’t Remember mutate any element of the outside world  with being relative to the function itself , they don’t mutate their arguments, and they don’t explode  or throw an excep- tion or anything else  if an error occurs. They can, however, return an exception or anything else, such as an error message. But they must return it, not throw it, nor log it, nor print it. I go into more detail on pure functions in section 3.2.4.  outside  3.2   Functions in Kotlin In chapter 1, you used what Kotlin calls functions but which are, in fact, methods.

A is a relationship between a source set and a target set that must fulfill some specific requirement. Now imagine a function having the set of all possible elements as its source set and the integer 5 as its target set. Believe it or not, this is a function that fulfills all the requirements of the definition of a function. It’s a specific type of function whose result doesn’t depend on its argument. This is called a constant function. You don’t need to specify any argument to call it and there’s no need to give it a special name. Let’s call it 5. This is pure theory, but it’s worth remembering. It will be useful later.  Using object constructors as functions Objects constructors are, in fact, functions. Unlike Java, which uses a special syntax for creating objects, Kotlin uses the function syntax for this.  But it’s not the syntax that makes objects functions; Java objects are functions, too.  In Kotlin, you can obtain an instance of object by using the name of the class followed by the constructor argument list enclosed in parentheses, like so: val person = Person "Elvis"   This raises an important question. I said that a pure function should always return the same value for the same argument. You may wonder if constructors are pure functions. Consider the following example: val elvis = Person "Elvis"  val theKing = Person "Elvis"   Two objects are created with the same argument, so it should return the same value. val elvis = Person "Elvis"  val theKing = Person "Elvis"   println elvis == theKing     should return "true"  The test for equality returns ingly. This will be the case if data class Person val name: String   true Person  only if an  equals  function has been defined accord-  is a data class  as seen in chapter 2 :                                                                                           54  chapter 3  Programming with functions  Otherwise, it’s up to you to define equality.  3.2.4  Using Kotlin’s fun functions  You may recall that I’ve mentioned pure functions before. Whichever way you declare  those, Kotlin functions declared with the  fun keyword aren’t guaranteed to be real  functions. What programmers call functions are so rarely real functions that program- mers have coined an expression to mean real functions. They call them pure functions.   By analogy, the other functions are called impure functions.  In this section, I’ll explain  what makes a function pure and give you some examples of pure functions.  Here’s what’s needed for a function method to be a pure function:  ¡	It mustn’t mutate anything outside the function. No internal mutation can be   visible from the outside.  ¡	It mustn’t mutate its argument. ¡	It mustn’t throw errors or exceptions. ¡	It must always return a value. ¡	When called with the same argument, it must always return the same result.  Let’s look at an example of pure and impure functions as shown in the next listing.  Listing 3.1    Pure and impure functions  class FunFunctions {      var percent1 = 5     private var percent2 = 9     val percent3 = 13      fun add a: Int, b: Int : Int = a + b      fun mult a: Int, b: Int? : Int = 5      fun div a: Int, b: Int : Int = a   b      fun div a: Double, b: Double : Double = a   b      fun applyTax1 a: Int : Int = a   100 *  100 + percent1       fun applyTax2 a: Int : Int = a   100 *  100 + percent2       fun applyTax3 a: Int : Int = a   100 *  100 + percent3       fun append i: Int, list: MutableList  : List  {         list.add i          return list     }      fun append2 i: Int, list: List   = list + i }   Functions in Kotlin     55  Can you say which of these functions methods represent pure functions? Think for  a few minutes before reading the answer that follows. Think about all the conditions  and all the processing done inside the functions. Remember that what counts is what’s  visible from the outside. Don’t forget to consider exceptional conditions: fun add a: Int, b: Int : Int = a + b  The first function, add, is a pure function because it always returns a value that depends  only on its arguments. It doesn’t mutate its arguments and doesn’t interact in any way  with the outside world. This function can cause an error if the sum a + b overflows the  maximum Int value. But it won’t throw an exception. The result will be erroneous  a  negative value ; this is another problem. The result must be the same each time the func- tion is called with the same arguments. This doesn’t mean that the result must be exact!  Exactness The term exact doesn’t mean anything by itself. It generally means that it fits what’s  expected. To say whether the result of a function implementation is exact, you must know  the intention of the implementer. Usually you’ll have nothing but the function name to  determine the intention, which can be a source of misunderstanding.     The second function fun mult a: Int, b: Int? : Int = 5  is a pure function. The fact that it always returns the same value whatever the argu- ments are is irrelevant, as is the fact that the function name has nothing to do with what the function returns. This function is a constant.  The  div  function working on  Int  isn’t a pure function because it’ll throw an excep-  tion if the divisor is fun div a: Int, b: Int : Int = a   b  0:  div  a pure function, you could test the second parameter and return a value if Int, so it would be difficult to find a meaningful value, function working on doubles is a pure function Infinity, which is an  To make it’s null.

The because dividing by 0.0 won’t throw an exception, but will return instance of fun div a: Double, b: Double : Double = a   b  Double:  div  results in  is absorbing for addition, meaning that adding  Infinity Infinity. It’s not fully absorbing for multiplication because multiplying is an instance of 0.0 consider the next code snippet: var percent1 = 5 fun applyTax1 a: Int : Int = a   100 *  100 + percent1    Not a Number .

As a consequence, two function calls with the same argument could return differ- ent values: can be considered an implicit parameter, but this parameter isn’t evaluated at the same time as the explicit argument. This isn’t a problem if you use the value only once inside the function, but if you read it twice, it could change percent1 between the two read operations. If you need to use the value twice, you must read it once and keep it in a local variable. This means the method is a pure func- tion of the pair   a, percent1 , but it’s not a pure function of  applyTax1  a.  In this example, the class itself can be considered a supplemental implicit argument because all its properties are accessible from inside the function. This is an important notion.

The   applyTax1 function can be rewritten outside the fun applyTax1 ff: FunFunctions, a: Int : Int = a   100 *  100 + ff.percent1    or even inside  as  FunFunctions  This function can be called from inside the class, passing a reference to arguments, such as it’s public, provided a reference to a Tax1  for the applyTax1 this, a .

Functions that don’t access the enclosing class instance can be safely moved out of the class. You can put such functions in the companion object  making them roughly equivalent to Java static methods  or at the package level, outside of any class. You can also put functions accessing the enclos- ing instance in the companion object or at package level if their implicit parameter  the enclosing instance  is made explicit. Consider the class Payment val creditCard: CreditCard, val amount: Int  {  class from chapter 1:  Payment  fun combine payment: Payment : Payment =  if  creditCard == payment.creditCard   Payment creditCard, amount + payment.amount   else  companion object {  throw IllegalStateException "Cards don't match."   fun groupByCard payments: List  : List  =  payments.groupBy { it.creditCard }  .values .map { it.reduce Payment::combine  }  }  }  combine  function  accesses the enclosing class’s  The fields. As a result, it can’t be put outside of the class or in the companion object. This function has the enclosing class as an implicit parameter. You could make this parameter explicit, which would allow you to define the function at the package level or in the companion object: fun combine payment1: Payment, payment2: Payment : Payment =  creditCard  amount  and  if  payment1.creditCard == payment2.creditCard   Payment payment1.creditCard, payment1.amount + payment2.amount   else  throw IllegalStateException "Cards don't match."   A function declared in the companion object or at package level lets you make sure no unwanted access exists to the enclosing scope. But it changes the way the function   can be used. If used from inside the class, the function can be called passing it the this reference: val newPayment = combine this, otherPayment   little   makes   difference,   This  compose  calls. If you need to combine several payments, an instance function written as fun combine payment: Payment : Payment =  changes   when   need   you   but   all   to   it   function  if  creditCard == payment.creditCard   Payment creditCard, amount + payment.amount   else  throw IllegalStateException "Cards don't match."   can be used with object notation like this: val newPayment = payment1.combine payment2 .combine payment2                                                                                  58  chapter 3  Programming with functions  That’s much easier to read than this: import ...Payment.Companion.combine  val newPayment = combine combine payment1, payment2 , payment3   This  example  throws  an  exception  if  the  credit  cards  don’t  match,  but  this  is  only  because you’ve not yet learned how to handle errors functionally. This will be the sub- ject of chapter 7.  3.2.6  Using value functions  I said previously that functions can be used as data, but this isn’t the case for func- tions declared with the fun keyword. Kotlin allows treating functions as data. Kotlin has  function types, and functions can be assigned to references of the corresponding types  in the same way other types of data are treated. Consider the following function: fun double x: Int : Int = x * 2  The same function might be declared as val double:  Int  -> Int = { x -> x * 2 }  The type of the double function is  Int  -> Int. At the left of the arrow is the param- eter type, enclosed in parentheses. The return type is indicated on the right side of  the arrow. The definition of the function comes after the equals sign. It’s enclosed  between braces and takes the form of a lambda expression.  In the previous example, the lambda consists of a name given to the parameter, an  arrow, and an expression that when evaluated will be the result returned by the func- tion. Here, this expression is simple, so it can be written on a single line. If the expres- sion were more complex, it could be written on several lines. In such a case, the result  would be the evaluation of the last line as in the following example: val doubleThenIncrement:  Int  -> Int = { x ->     val double = x * 2     double + 1 }  The last line shouldn’t have a return.  Functions  of  tuples  are  no  different.  Here’s  a  function  representing  addition  of   integers: val add:  Int, Int  -> Int = { x, y -> x + y }  As you can see, in the function type, the  single  argument is included between paren- theses. By contrast, no parentheses can be used to enclose the parameter in the lambda  expression.  When the parameter is not a tuple  or, more precisely, when it’s a tuple of one single   element , you can use the special name it: val double:  Int  -> Int = { it * 2 }   Functions in Kotlin     59  This simplifies the syntax, although it sometimes makes the code less readable, particu- larly when several function implementations are nested.  NOTE    In this example, double isn’t the name of the function. A function has  no name. Here, it’s assigned to a reference of the corresponding type, so that  you can then manipulate it in the same way you’d do for any other piece of  data. When you write  val number: Int = 5  you wouldn’t say that number is the name of 5. It’s the same for functions.  You might wonder why Kotlin has two kinds of functions. Because functions are values,  why should you use the fun keyword to define functions?  As I said at the start of section 3.2.4, functions defined with fun aren’t really functions.  You can call them methods, subprograms, procedures, or whatever. They can represent  pure functions  always returning the same value for a given argument without any other  effect visible from outside , but you can’t treat them as data.  Why should you use them? Because fun functions are much more efficient. They are  an optimization. Each time you use a function only to pass it an argument and get the  corresponding return value, you’ll be using the version defined with fun. This is abso- lutely not mandatory, but it’s wise.  On the other hand, each time you want to use a function as data  for example, to  pass it to another function—an argument you’ll see soon , or to get it as the return  value of another function, or to store it in a variable, a map, or any other data structure,  you’ll be using an expression of the function type.  You may wonder how you can convert from one form to the other. It’s quite simple.  You’ll only need to convert from fun to the expression type because you can’t create fun  at runtime.  3.2.7  Using function references  Kotlin offers the same functionality as Java does under the name of method references.  But, as you may recall, in Kotlin methods are called functions, so method references  are called function references in Kotlin. Here’s an example of using a fun function in  a lambda: fun double n: Int : Int = n * 2  val mutliplyBy2:  Int  -> Int = { n -> double n  }  You could have also written val mutliplyBy2:  Int  -> Int = { double it  }  Using a function reference simplifies the syntax: val mutliplyBy2:  Int  -> Int = ::double   60  chapter    3  Programming with functions  is   the  double  called   function   the Here,  function. If it were an instance function of another class, you could mutliplyBy2 use the following syntax, provided you have a reference to an instance of this class available: class MyClass {  package   object,   class,   same   the   on   or   as   fun double n: Int : Int = n * 2  }  val foo = MyClass   val mutliplyBy2:  Int  -> Int = foo::double  Alternatively, if import other.package.double  double  is defined in another package, you have to import it:  val mutliplyBy2:  Int  -> Int = ::double  In the case of a function defined in the companion object of a class  somewhat equiva- lent to a Java static method , you can either import it or you can use the following syntax: val mutliplyBy2:  Int  -> Int =  MyClass ::double  This is a shorthand for val mutliplyBy2:  Int  -> Int = MyClass.Companion::double  .Companion  or the parentheses. Otherwise, you’ll get a completely differ-  companion object {  fun double n: Int : Int = n * 2  Don’t forget ent result: class MyClass {  }  }  In such a case, the Int  -> Int.  val mutliplyBy2:  MyClass, Int  -> Int = MyClass::double  multiplyBy2  function type is not   Int    ->   Int, but   MyClass,  3.2.8   Composing functions If you use fun square n: Int  = n * n  fun  functions, composing them seems simple:  fun triple n: Int  = n * 3  println square triple 2     36  But this isn’t function composition. In this example, you’re composing function appli- cations. Function composition is a binary operation on functions, just as addition is a binary operation on numbers, so you can compose functions programmatically, using another function.                                                                         Functions in Kotlin     61  exercise 3.1 Write the compose function  declared with 'fun' , allowing to compose functions from  Int to Int.  NOTE    Solutions  follow  each  exercise,  but  you  should  first  try  to  solve  the  exercise without looking at the answer. The solution code also appears on the  book’s website. This exercise is simple, but some exercises will be quite hard, so  it might be difficult to refrain from cheating. Remember that the harder you  search, the more you learn.  hint The compose function will take as its parameters two functions of type  Int  -> Int  and will return a function of the same type. The compose function can be declared  with fun, but the parameters need to be values. You can transform a function myFunc  declared with fun into a value  val  function, prefixing its name with ::. soLution Here’s the solution using a lambda: fun compose f:  Int  -> Int, g:  Int  -> Int :  Int  -> Int = { x -> f g x   }  Alternatively, it can be simplified as fun compose f:  Int  -> Int, g:  Int  -> Int :  Int  -> Int = { f g it   }  You can use this function to compose square and triple: val squareOfTriple = compose ::square, ::triple  println squareOfTriple 2   36  Now you can start to see how powerful this concept is! But two big problems remain.  The first is that your functions can only take integer  Int  arguments and return inte- gers. Let’s deal with this first.  To make your function more reusable, you can change it into a polymorphic function  by using type parameters. exercise 3.2 Make the compose function polymorphic by using type parameters. hint Declare the type parameters between the fun keyword and the name of the function.  Then replace the Int types with the right parameters, taking care of the order of exe- cution. Remember you’re defining f     g, meaning that you must first apply g, and  then apply f to the result. Specify the return type. If the types don’t match, it won’t  compile.  3.2.9  Reusing functions   62  chapter    3  Programming with functions  3.3   3.3.1   doesn’t   exercise   soLution The  same  signature: fun   compose f:  U  -> V, g:  T  -> U :  T  -> V = { f g it   }  writing  nonpolymorphic   function.  finding   implementation   implementation   of  about   in  the   consist   one.   the   the   It’s   as   the   It’s   the right  Here, you’re seeing the benefit of a strong type system with parameterized types.

But you haven’t answered a fundamental question: Why do you need functions represented as data? Couldn’t you simply use the version? Before answering this question, you need to consider the problem of  multi-argument  functions.  fun  What about functions of several arguments? In section 3.1.5, I said that there are no functions of several arguments, but only func- tions of one tuple of elements. The cardinality of a tuple can be whatever you need, and there are specific names for tuples with a few elements: pair, triplet, quartet, and so on. Other possible names exist, and some prefer to call them tuple2, tuple3, tuple4, and so forth. Kotlin has predefined Triple. But I also said that elements of the argument can be applied one by one, with each application of one element return- ing a new function, except for the last one.  Pair  and  Let’s try to define a function for adding two integers. You’ll apply a function to the  first integer, and this will return a function. The type is as follows:  Int  ->  Int  -> Int   Int   is the type of the argument, and  In this syntax, return value. To remember how the there were parentheses around the return value so it’s equivalent to  Int  ->   Int  -> Int   is the type of the symbol associates, you can think of this as if   Int  -> Int  ->  and the return type is a function taking an argument of type  3.3  Int Int.  The argument type is Int, and returning an exercise Write a function to add two soLution This function will take an so the type will be mented using lambdas. The end result is shown here: val add:  Int  ->  Int  -> Int = { a -> { b -> a + b} }  values.  Int  Int   Int  ->  Int  -> Int. Let’s give it the name  as its argument and return a function from  Int  Int, add. It’ll be imple-  to                                                                                                                                               Advanced function features     63  If you prefer a shorter type name, you can create an alias: typealias IntBinOp =  Int  ->  Int  -> Int  val add: IntBinOp = { a -> { b -> a + b} } val mult: IntBinOp = { a -> { b -> a * b} }  Here IntBinOp, the type alias, stands for Integer Binary Operator. The number of argu- ments isn’t limited. You can define functions with as many arguments as you need. As  I said in the first part of this chapter, functions such as the add function or the mult  function are said to be the curried form of the equivalent functions of tuples.  3.3.2  Applying curried functions  You’ve seen how to write curried function types and how to implement them. But how  do you apply them? Well, you apply them like any function. You apply the function to  the first argument, then apply the result to the next argument, and so on until the last  one. For example, you can apply the add function to 3 and 5: println add 3  5    8  3.3.3   Implementing higher-order functions In section 3.2.8, you wrote a fun function to compose functions. This function took as  its argument a tuple of two functions and returned a function. But instead of using a  fun function  actually a method , you could use a value function. This special kind of  function, taking functions as its arguments and returning functions, is called a higher-  order function  HOF . exercise 3.4 Write a value function to compose two functions; for example, the square and triple  functions used previously. soLution This exercise is easy if you follow the right procedure. The first thing to do is to write  the type. This function will work on two arguments, so it’ll be a curried function. The  two arguments and the return type will be functions from Int to Int:  Int  -> Int  You can call this T. You want to create a function taking an argument of type T  the first  argument  and returning a function from T  the second argument  to T  the return  value . The type of the function is then as follows:  T  ->  T  -> T  If you replace T with its value, you obtain the real type:   Int  -> Int  ->   Int  -> Int  ->  Int  -> Int   64  chapter 3  Programming with functions  The main problem here is the line length! Let’s now add the implementation, which is  much easier than the type:  x -> { y -> { z -> x y z   } } }  The complete code is shown here: val compose:   Int  -> Int  ->   Int  -> Int  ->  Int  -> Int =                                       { x -> { y -> { z -> x y z   } } }  If you prefer, you can take advantage of type inference and omit specifying the return  type. But you’ll then have to specify the type of each argument: val compose = { x:  Int  -> Int -> { y:  Int  -> Int ->                                     { z: Int -> x y z   } } }  Or you can use an alias: typealias IntUnaryOp =  Int  -> Int  val compose:  IntUnaryOp  ->  IntUnaryOp  -> IntUnaryOp =                                 { x -> { y -> { z -> x y z   } } }  You can test this code with the square and triple functions: typealias IntUnaryOp =  Int  -> Int  val compose:  IntUnaryOp  ->  IntUnaryOp  -> IntUnaryOp =                             { x -> { y -> { z -> x y z   } } }  val square: IntUnaryOp = { it * it }  val triple: IntUnaryOp = { it * 3 }  val squareOfTriple = compose square  triple   In this code, you start by applying the first argument, which gives you a new function  to apply to the second argument. The result is a function, which is the composition of  the two function arguments. Applying this new function to  for example  2 gives you  the result of first applying triple to 2 and then applying square to the result  which  corresponds to the definition of function composition : println squareOfTriple 2    36  Pay attention to the order of the parameters: triple is applied first and then square is  applied to the result returned by triple.  3.3.4  Creating polymorphic HOFs  Your compose function is fine, but it can compose only functions from Int to Int. A  polymorphic compose function would also allow you to compose functions of different  types, provided that the return type of one is the same as the argument type of the  other.   Advanced function features     65  compose  function.  3.5  hard   exercise Write a polymorphic version of the hint You’ll face a problem with this exercise due to the lack of polymorphic properties in Kotlin. In Kotlin, you can create polymorphic classes, interfaces, and functions, but you  a function, class, or interface, instead of in a property. soLution The first step seems to be to “type parameterize” the example of Exercise 3.3: val   higherCompose:   U  -> V  ->   T  -> U  ->  T  -> V =  polymorphic   properties.   function   solution   define   store   can’t   The   the   in   to   is   this   isn’t   Kotlin   doesn’t   because   possible   But  prop- erties. To be parameterized, a property must be created in a scope defining the type parameters. Only classes, interfaces, and functions declared with can define type parameters, so you need to define your property inside one of those elements. The most practical is a fun   higherCompose  :   U  -> V  ->   T  -> U  ->  T  -> V =  parameterized   standalone   function:  allow   fun  fun  { f ->  { g ->  }  }  { x -> f g x   }  { f ->  { g ->  }  }  { x -> f g x   }  fun  function called  higherCompose    takes no parameter and always returns the The function is irrelevant from same value. It’s a constant. The fact that it’s defined as a this point of view. It isn’t a function for composing functions. It’s only a function returning a value function that composes value functions. You may prefer to avoid indi- cating the return type. In such a case, you must indicate parameter types: fun   higherCompose   =  fun  fun  { f:  U  -> V ->  { g:  T  -> U ->  { x: T -> f g x   }  }  }  Now you could use this function to compose val squareOfTriple = higherCompose   square  triple   triple  and  square:  But this doesn’t compile, producing the following error: Error: 79, 24  Kotlin: Type inference failed:  Not enough information to infer parameter T in fun   higherCompose  :   U  -> V  ->   T  -> U  ->  T  -> V  Please specify it explicitly.                                                                                                             66  chapter 3  Programming with functions  The compiler is saying that it couldn’t infer the real types for the T, U, and V type param- eters. If you think that the type of the parameters   Int  -> Int  should be enough  information to infer the T, U, and V types, then you’re smarter than Kotlin!  The solution is to help the compiler by telling it what real types T, U, and V are. Insert-  ing the type information after the function name can do this: val squareOfTriple = higherCompose    square  triple   exercise 3.6  easy now!  Write the higherAndThen function that composes the functions the other way around,  which means that higherCompose f, g  is equivalent to higherAndThen g, f . soLution  fun   higherAndThen  :   T  -> U  ->   U  -> V  ->  T  -> V =         { f:  T  -> U ->             { g:  U  -> V ->                 { x: T -> g f x   }             }         }  Testing function parameters If you have any doubt concerning the order of the parameters, you should test these  HOFs with functions of different types. Testing with functions from Int to Int will be  ambiguous because you’ll be able to compose the functions in both orders, so an error  will be difficult to detect. Here’s a test using functions of different types:  fun testHigherCompose   {      val f:  Double  -> Int = { a ->  a * 3 .toInt   }     val g:  Long  -> Double = { a -> a + 2.0 }      assertEquals Integer.valueOf 9 , f g 1L        assertEquals Integer.valueOf 9 ,             higherCompose    f  g  1L   }     3.3.5  Using anonymous functions  to   now,   been   using   you’ve   named   functions.   Up for functions; you’ll use them as anonymous functions. Let’s look at an example. Instead of writing val f:  Double  -> Double = { Math.PI   2 - it } val sin:  Double  -> Double = Math::sin val cos: Double = compose f, sin  2.0   Often,   names   define   won’t   you   you can use anonymous functions as shown here: val cosValue: Double =  compose { x: Double -> Math.PI   2 - x }, Math::sin  2.0                                  Advanced function features     67  Here, you’re using the also applies to HOFs: val cos = higherCompose     function defined with  compose   { x: Double -> Math.PI   2 - x }   Math::sin   fun  at the package level. But this  val cosValue = cos 2.0   two   parameters   the cos compose  of The  in  parentheses. Unlike the defined in curried form, applying one parameter at a time. Also note that the lambda can be put outside of the parentheses: val cos = higherCompose       definition  higherCompose  function  function,  enclosed   separate   sets   are   in   is  { x: Double -> Math.PI   2 - x }  Math::sin     to    use    anonymous                named use to when and functions functions  Beside the fact that lines are broken due to limited line length in this book, the last form might seem a bit awkward, but it’s the recommended formatting in Kotlin. when Apart from special cases when anonymous functions can’t be used, it’s up to you to choose between anonymous and named value functions.  Functions declared with   fun always have a name.  As a general rule, functions that are used only once are defined as anonymous instances. But means that you write the function once. It doesn’t mean that it’s instantiated only once.  used once  In the following example, you define a Dou- value. The function implementation uses two anonymous functions because you’re  ble using a lambda expression and a function reference: fun cos arg: Double  = compose { x -> Math.PI   2 - x }, Math::sin  arg   function to compute the cosine of a  fun  and   clarity   maintainability   Don’t worry about the creation of anonymous functions. Kotlin won’t always create new objects each time the function is called. Instantiating such objects is cheap. Instead, you should decide whether to use anonymous or named functions by considering only the  performance and reusability, you should use function references as often as possible. impLementing Type inference can also be an issue with anonymous functions. In the previous exam- ple, the types of the two anonymous functions can be inferred by the compiler because it knows that the fun   compose f:  U  -> V, g:  T  -> U :  T  -> V = { f g it   }  function takes two functions as arguments:  concerned     inference  compose  you’re   code.   your   with     type  of   If   But this won’t always work.

Kotlin is now unable to infer the types of both arguments. To make this code compile, you need to add type annotations: fun cos arg: Double  =  compose { x: Double -> Math.PI   2 - x }, { x: Double -> Math.sin x }  arg   This is a good reason to prefer function references.  3.3.6   Defining local functions You defining fun cos arg: Double : Double {  fun  saw that you can define value functions locally in functions, but Kotlin also allows  functions inside functions, as seen in the following example:  fun f x: Double : Double = Math.PI   2 - x fun sin x: Double : Double = Math.sin x  return compose ::f, ::sin  arg   }  3.3.7   Implementing closures You’ve seen that pure functions mustn’t depend on anything other than their argu- ments to evaluate their return values. Kotlin functions often access elements outside the function itself, either at the package level or as class or object properties. Functions can even access members of other classes’s companion objects or other packages.  are   I’ve   said   that   pure   functions   functions   transparency, which means they have no observable effects besides returning a value.

This can be achieved by using functions of tuples of arguments: val taxRate = 0.09  fun addTax taxRate: Double, price: Double  = price + price * taxRate  println addTax taxRate, 12.0    This applies also to value functions: val taxRate = 0.09  val addTax = { taxRate: Double, price: Double -> price + price * taxRate }  println addTax taxRate, 12.0    The addTax function takes a single argument, which is a pair of Double. Unlike Java,  Kotlin allows the use of arguments of cardinality greater than 2.  In Java, you can use  the Function interface for a single argument and the BiFunction interface for a pair  of arguments. If you want triples or more, you have to define your own interfaces.   But you’ve already seen that you could use the curried version to get the same result.  A curried function takes a single argument and returns a function taking a single argu- ment, returning…  and so on until returning the final value. Here’s the curried version  of the addTax value function: val taxRate = 0.09  val addTax = { taxRate: Double ->                 { price: Double ->                     price + price * taxRate                 }              }  println addTax taxRate  12.0    A curried version of a fun function makes little sense. You could use a fun for the first  function, but you’re forced to return a value function. fun function aren’t values.  3.3.8  Applying functions partially and automatic currying  The closure and curried versions in the previous example give the same results and  might be seen as equivalent. In fact, they’re semantically different. As I’ve already said,  the two parameters play totally different roles. The tax rate isn’t supposed to change  often, whereas the price is supposed to be different on each invocation. This appears  clearly in the closure version. The function closes over a parameter that doesn’t change   because it’s a val . In the curried version, both arguments can change on each invo- cation, although the tax rate won’t change more often than in the closure version.  It’s common to need a changing tax rate, such as when you have several tax rates for  different categories of products or for different shipping destinations. In traditional    70  chapter 3  Programming with functions  object programming, turning the class into a parameterized tax computer could accom- modate this. Here’s an example: class TaxComputer private val rate: Double  {      fun compute price: Double : Double = price * rate + price }  With this class, you can create several TaxComputer instances for several tax rates, and  these instances can be reused as often as needed: val tc9 = TaxComputer 0.09  val price = tc9.compute 12.0   You can achieve the same thing with a curried function by partially applying it: val tc9 = addTax 0.09  val price = tc9 12.0   Here, the addTax function is the one from the end of section 3.3.7. The type of tc9 is  now  Double  -> Double; it’s a function taking a Double as its argument and return- ing a Double with the tax added.  You can see that currying and partial application are closely related. Currying con- sists in replacing a function of a tuple with a new function that you can partially apply,  one argument after another. This is the main difference between a curried function  and a function of a tuple. With a function of a tuple, all arguments are evaluated before  the function is applied.  With the curried version, all arguments must be known before the function is totally  applied, but a single argument can be evaluated and the function partially applied to it.  You aren’t obligated to totally curry the function. A function of three arguments can be  curried into a function of a tuple that produces a function of a single argument.  Abstraction being the essence of programming, currying and partially applying func- tions can be abstracted in order to do this automatically. In the preceding sections,  you  used  mostly  curried  functions  and  not  functions  of  tuples.  Using  curried  func- tions presents a great advantage: partially applying this kind of function is absolutely  straightforward. exercise 3.7  easy  Write a fun function to partially apply a curried function of two arguments to its first  argument. soLution You have nothing to do! The signature of this function is as follows: fun   partialA a: A, f:  A  ->  B  -> C :  B  -> C  You can see immediately that partially applying the first argument is as simple as apply- ing the second argument  a function  to the first one: fun   partialA a: A, f:  A  ->  B  -> C :  B  -> C =  f a    Advanced function features     71   If you’d like to see an example of how this exercise in the accompanying code.   partialA  can be used, look at the unit test for  You might have noticed that the original function was of type   A  ->  B  -> C.

You can start the imple-  mentation by writing this: fun   partialB b: B, f:  A  ->  B  -> C :  A  -> C =  { a: A ->  a  Here, is a variable of type composed of the function tion from applying it to the fun   partialB b: B, f:  A  ->  B  -> C :  A  -> C =  A.

As I said, the most important thing is that you had a curried version of the func- tion. You’ll probably learn quickly how to write curried functions directly.

Remember, however, that you must define this function in a scope that accepts type parameters, which isn’t the case for a property. You must then define it in a class, an interface, or a 'fun' function with all needed type parameters.  Here’s a solution using a function. First, write the enclosing  fun  function declaration  with the type parameters: fun   curried    Then, think about the signature of the resulting function. The first parameter will be an A, so you can write fun   curried  :  A  ->  Then do the same thing with the second parameter type: fun   curried  :  A  ->  B  ->  Then continue until no parameters are left: fun   curried  :  A  ->  B  ->  C  ->  D  ->  Add the return type of the resulting function: fun   curried  :  A  ->  B  ->  C  ->  D  -> String  For the implementation, list as many parameters as needed, separating them with right arrows and opening braces  starting with a brace and ending with an arrow : fun   curried   =  { a: A ->  { b: B ->  { c: C ->  { d: D ->  }  }  }  }  add   Finally,  the  close all braces: fun   curried   =  { a: A ->  { b: B ->  { c: C ->  { d: D ->  "$a, $b, $c, $d"  }  implementation,   which   is   the   same   as   in   the   original   function,   and                                                       Advanced function features     73                  }             }         }  The same principle can be applied to curry a function of any tuple. exercise 3.10 Write a function to curry a function of a  A, B  to C. soLution Again, you have to follow the types. You know the function will take a parameter of type   A, B  -> C and will return  A  ->  B  -> C, so the signature is as follows: fun   curry f:  A, B  -> C :  A  ->  B  -> C  Now,  for  the  implementation,  you’ll  have  to  return  a  curried  function  of  two  argu- ments, so you can start with this: fun   curry f:  A, B  -> C :  A  ->  B  -> C =     { a ->         { b ->          }     }  Eventually, you’ll need to evaluate the return type. For this, you can use the function f  and apply it to parameters a and b: fun   curry f:  A, B  -> C :  A  ->  B  -> C =     { a ->         { b ->             f a, b          }     }  Once again, if it compiles, it can’t be wrong. This is one of the numerous benefits of  relying on a strong type system!  This isn’t always true, but you’ll learn in the next  chapters how to make this happen more often.   3.3.9  Switching arguments of partially-applied functions  If you have a function of two arguments, you might want to apply only the first argu- ment to get a partially-applied function. Let’s say you have the following function: val addTax:  Double  ->  Double  -> Double =     { x ->         { y ->             y + y   100 * x         }     }  You might want to first apply the tax to get a new function of one argument that you  can then apply to any price: val add9percentTax:  Double  -> Double = addTax 9.0    74  chapter 3  Programming with functions  Then, when you want to add tax to a price, you can do this: val priceIncludingTax = add9percentTax price ;  This is fine, but what if the initial function was as follows: val addTax:  Double  ->  Double  -> Double =     { x ->         { y ->             x + x   100 * y         }     }  In this case, the price is the first argument. Applying the price only is probably use- less,  but  how  can  you  apply  the  tax  only?   Suppose  you  don’t  have  access  to  the  implementation.  exercise 3.11 Write a 'fun' function to swap the arguments of a curried function. soLution The following function returns a curried function with the arguments in reverse order.  It could be generalized to any number of arguments and to any arrangement of them: fun   swapArgs f:  T  ->  U  -> V :  U  ->  T  ->  V  =                                         { u -> { t -> f t  u  } }  Given this function, you can partially apply any of the two arguments. For example, if  you have a function computing the monthly payment for a loan from an interest rate  and an amount val  payment = { amount -> { rate -> ... } }  You can easily create a function of one argument to compute the payment for a fixed  amount and a varying rate, or a function computing the payment for a fixed rate and a  varying amount.  You’ve seen that you can treat functions as data. They can be passed as arguments to  other functions, they can be returned by functions, and they can be used in operations  exactly like integers or strings. In future exercises, you’ll apply operations to functions,  and you’ll need a neutral element for these operations. A neutral element acts as the 0  for addition, or 1 for multiplication, or the empty string for string concatenation.  A neutral element is only neutral for a given operation. For integer addition, 1 is  not neutral, and for multiplication, 0 is even less neutral. Here, I’m speaking of a neu- tral element for function composition. This specific function is a function returning its  argument. For this reason, it’s called the identity function. By extension, the term identity  element is often used instead of neutral element for operations such as addition multipli- cation or string concatenation. The identity function in Kotlin can be expressed simply: val identity = { it }  3.3.10  Declaring the identity function   Advanced function features     75  3.3.11  Using the right types  In the previous examples, you’ve used standard types such as Int, Double, and String  to represent business entities such as prices and tax rates. Although this is common  practice in programming, it causes problems that should be avoided. As I said, you  should trust types more than names. Calling a Double “price” doesn’t make it a price.  It only shows your intention. Calling another Double “taxRate” shows a different inten- tion, which no compiler can enforce.  To make programs safer, you need to use more powerful types that the compiler can  check. This prevents messing with types such as adding taxRate to a price. If you inad- vertently do this, the compiler will only see a Double being added to a Double, which is  perfectly legit, but totally wrong. avoiding probLems with standard types Let’s examine a simplified problem and see how solving it by using standard types leads  to problems. Imagine you have products with a name, a price, and a weight, and you  need to create invoices representing product sales. These invoices must mention the  products, the quantities, the total price, and the total weight. You could represent a  Product with the following class: data class Product val name: String, val price: Double, val weight: Double   Next, you can use an OrderLine class to represent each line of an order: data class OrderLine val product: Product, val count: Int  {        fun weight   = product.weight * count        fun amount   = product.price * count }  This looks like a good old object, initialized with a Product and an Int, and represent- ing one line of an order. It also has functions for returning the total price and the total  weight for the line.  Continuing with the decision to use standard types, you’ll use List  to   represent an order. The following listing shows how you can handle orders.  Listing 3.2    Handling orders  package com.fpinkotlin.functions.listing03_02  data class Product val name: String, val price: Double, val weight: Double   data class OrderLine val product: Product, val count: Int  {        fun weight   = product.weight * count        fun amount   = product.price * count }  Store is a singleton object.  object Store {                        76  chapter 3  Programming with functions  The @JvmStatic annotation  makes the main function  callable as if it were a Java  static method.     @JvmStatic                          fun main args: Array   {        val toothPaste = Product "Tooth paste", 1.5, 0.5         val toothBrush = Product "Tooth brush", 3.5, 0.3          val orderLines = listOf                  OrderLine toothPaste, 2 ,                 OrderLine toothBrush, 3           val weight = orderLines.sumByDouble { it.amount   }         val price = orderLines.sumByDouble { it.weight   }         println "Total price: $price"          println "Total weight: $weight"     } }  Running this program displays the following result on the console: Total price: 1.9 Total weight: 13.5  This is fine, but wrong! Although the error is obvious, the problem is that the compiler didn’t tell you anything about it.  You can see the error by looking at the code.  But the same error could have been made when creating a Product, and the creation of a  could have happened far away.  Product  Store  The only way to catch this error is to test the program, but tests can’t prove a pro- gram to be correct. They can only prove that you haven’t been able to prove it incorrect through writing another program  which, by the way, could be incorrect too . In case you didn’t notice it  which is unlikely , the problem is in the following lines: val weight = orderLines.sumByDouble { it.amount   } val price = orderLines.sumByDouble { it.weight   }  have   You  because those are both doubles.  incorrectly   mixed   prices   and   weights,   which   the   compiler   couldn’t   notice       If you’ve learned about modeling, you might recall an old rule: classes NOTE shouldn’t have several properties of the same type. Instead, they should have one property with a specific cardinality. Here, this would mean that a   Product with a cardinality of 2. This is clearly should have one property of type not the right way to solve the problem, but it’s a good rule to remember.

This function takes two parameters: the starting value and a function allow- ing you to compose the current result with the current element, while iterating over each element.  A  reduce  function  is much like a  fold, although it has no starting value. It must then take the first element as the starting value, which implies that the result type is the same as the element type. If applied to an empty collection, the result is or an error, or any other representation of the fact that there’s no result.  null  In   use  the   you’ll   because   example,   following   price— Price 0.0 —and a zero weight—Weight 0.0 —for the starting values.

This implies that you specify the types for val price: Price. Kotlin is able to infer the types, but by specifying them, you make it possible for the compiler to tell you if the inferred types differ from what you expect.  val weight: Weight  and                                                                                           Advanced function features     79  of   them   should   But you can do far better than this.

As a result, you can use the factory function exactly like the constructor, which is now private. The private constructor is used from the companion object to create the result of the function. It’s also used to create the value used for folding. Here’s the final code of the object Store {  identity  object:  Store  @JvmStatic fun main args: Array   {  val toothPaste = Product "Tooth paste", Price 1.5 , Weight 0.5   val toothBrush = Product "Tooth brush", Price 3.5 , Weight 0.3   val orderLines = listOf   OrderLine toothPaste, 2 , OrderLine toothBrush, 3    val weight: Weight =  orderLines.fold Weight.identity  { a, b ->  a + b.weight    val price: Price =  orderLines.fold Price.identity  { a, b ->  a + b.amount    }  }  println "Total price: $price"                                                                                                80  chapter 3  Programming with functions          println "Total weight: $weight"      } }  Nothing has changed for the creation of a price or a weight. The syntax to call the  invoke function is similar to the way you previously used the constructor, which is now  private. The “zero” value  called identity  used for the fold is read from the compan- ion object. It couldn’t be created from the invoke function due to the validation code  throwing an exception.

Such programs are generally much easier to read and to understand.

IMPORTANT into functions, rather than used directly.  Be aware that,       like loops, recursion should often be abstracted  81                                                                   82  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  4.1  Corecursion and recursion  Corecursion is composing computation steps by using the output of one step as the input  of the next one, starting with the first step. Recursion is the same operation but starts  with the last step. Let’s take as an example a list of characters that you want to join into  a string representation.  4.1.1   Implementing corecursion Let’s suppose you have at your disposal an append function taking a pair of  String,  Char  as its arguments and returning the argument string with the argument character  appended to it: fun append s: String, c: Char : String = "$s$c"  You can’t do anything with this function because you’ve no string to start with. You  need an additional element: the empty string "". With these two elements, you can  now construct the intended result. Figure 4.1 shows the processing of the list.  This process can be described in code as  fun toString list: List , s: String : String =         if  list.isEmpty                s         else             toString list.subList 1, list.size , append s, list[0]    With corecursion, computation can be carried on at each step.  “”  a b c  String  Character  List of characters  a  b  c  +  +  +  a b c  a b c  a b c  +  +  +  “”  “a”  “ab”  “abc”  These operations are possible.  Figure 4.1       Corecursively transforming a list of characters into a string     Corecursion and recursion     83  Note that list[0] returns the first element of the list, which corresponds to a function  generally known by the name head. On the other hand, list.subList 1, list.size   corresponds to a function named tail, which returns the rest of the list. You could  abstract these into separate functions, but you’d have to handle the case of an empty  list. Here, this won’t happen because the list is filtered by the if..else expression.  A more idiomatic solution would be to use the functions drop and first:  fun toString list: List , s: String : String =         if  list.isEmpty                s         else             toString list.drop 1 , append s, list.first      Using indexed access makes comparing corecursion and recursion easier. The only  problem with this implementation is that you have to call the toString function with  the empty string as an additional argument  or more precisely, as an additional part of  its argument . The simple solution is to write another function for this, taking advan- tage of the fact that Kotlin lets you declare functions inside functions: fun toString list: List  : String {     fun toString list: List , s: String : String =             if  list.isEmpty                    s             else                 toString list.subList 1, list.size , append s, list[0]       return toString list, ""  }  Here you’ll have to use a block function, meaning a function with curly braces, for the  enclosing  toString function. You also have to indicate explicitly the return type of  both functions for two reasons:  ¡	For the enclosing function, block functions must have an explicit return type;  otherwise, Unit is assumed.  Unit is the Kotlin equivalent of Java void, or more  exactly Void.   ¡	For the enclosed function, you must indicate the type, because the function is   calling itself. In such a case, Kotlin can’t infer the return type.  Another solution would be to add a second parameter to the function with a default  value: fun toString list: List , s: String = "" : String =         if  list.isEmpty                s         else             toString list.subList 1, list.size , append s, list[0]    4.1.2   Implementing recursion The previous implementation was possible only because you had at your disposal the  append function, which appends a character to a string, meaning adding the character    84  chapter  4    Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  to the end of the string. Now think about what you’d do if you only had access to the following function: fun prepend c: Char, s: String : String = "$c$s"  of   the   the   end   with   start   could   list You  before starting the computation, or you could change the implementation to return the  element  possible implementation: fun toString list: List  : String {  element.   without   reverse   Here’s   either   could   this,   and   you   For   list.   last   last   the   the   the   list   list   its   of   a   fun toString list: List , s: String : String =  if  list.isEmpty     s  else  toString list.subList 0, list.size - 1 ,  prepend list[list.size - 1], s    return toString list, ""   }  This would, however, only work with lists offering this type of access, such as the indexed list or the doubly-linked list, also known as double-   ended queue . If you were working with singly-linked lists, you’d have no choice but to reverse the list, which is far from efficient.   pronounced  and meaning  deque  dek  As a worst case scenario, take infinite lists. You might think that there’s nothing you can do with infinite lists, but this isn’t true. With Kotlin, you can apply functions to infinite lists, which produces other infinite lists. You can compose such functions to get the intended result, and then truncate the result before it’s computed.  Think of this example: if you want to compute the list of the 100 first primes  not that this would be extremely useful, but it’s only an example , you’d have to iterate the list of integers  which is infinite , testing which are primes, and stopping after the 100th prime. In this example, you could certainly not start with reversing the list. The solution is to use recursion instead of corecursion as shown in figure 4.2.  As you can see in the figure, no computation can be carried on until the terminal condition  here, the last element of the list  is encountered. As a result, intermediate steps must be stored somewhere until they can be evaluated. This process might be expressed in code as fun toString list: List  : String =  if  list.isEmpty     ""  else  prepend list[0], toString list.subList 1, list.size     As you’ll see, the main problem with this type of code is storing the intermediate steps. That’s because the JVM uses very limited memory space for this.  4.1.3   Differentiating recursive and corecursive functions Considering and   you’ve  examples   learned  are,  in   corecursive   at  fact,  recursive   school,   what   you   may   think   that   both   the   functions,   meaning   functions   recursive calling                                                                                                                                                                         Corecursion and recursion     85  With recursion, computation must be delayed until the terminal condition is reached.  a b c  “”  These are strings.

Well, if you stick by this definition of recursion, you’re right. But this isn’t  what recursion is.  A function is recursive if it calls itself as part of a computation. Otherwise, it’s not true  recursion. At least, it isn’t a recursive process. It might be a corecursive one. Think of a  method printing “Hello, World!” on the screen and eventually calling itself recursively: fun hello   {     println "Hello, World!"      hello   }  Doesn’t this look more like an infinite loop than a recursive method? Although it’s  implemented as a recursive method, it is in fact a corecursive one that could trans- late into an infinite loop! The good news is that Kotlin is able to do this translation  automatically.   86  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  4.1.4  Choosing recursion or corecursion  The problem with recursion is that all languages impose a limit to the number of recur- sive steps. In theory, the main difference between recursion and corecursion is as follows:  ¡	With corecursion, each step can be evaluated as soon as it’s encountered. ¡	With recursion, all steps must be stored somewhere in some form. This allows  delaying evaluation until the terminal condition is found. Only then can each  previous step be evaluated, in reverse order.  The memory needed for storing the recursive steps is often severely limited and can eas- ily overflow. To prevent this problem, it’s best to avoid recursion and prefer corecursion. The distinction between recursion and corecursion is illustrated in figures 4.3 and 4.4.  These figures represent the computation of the sum of a list of integers. Addition is a bit  special because  ¡	It’s commutative, meaning a + b = b + a, which isn’t the case for most operations,   such as adding a character to a string.  ¡	The two parameters, as well as the result, are of the same type. Once again, this   isn’t generally the case.  You  might  think  the  operations  on  the  figures  could  be  transformed,  for  example,  by removing parentheses. Let’s say it’s not possible.  This is only an example to show  what’s happening.   In figure 4.3, you can see a corecursive process. Each step is evaluated as soon as  it’s encountered. As a result, the amount of memory needed for the whole process is   Corecursive computation of the sum of the first 10 integers sum 1 to 10  = 1 + sum 2 to 10  =  1 + 2  + sum 3 to 10  = 3 + sum 3 to 10  =  3 + 3  + sum 4 to 10  = 6 + sum 4 to 10  =  6 + 4  + sum 5 to 10  = 10 + sum 5 to 10  =  10 + 5  + sum 6 to 10  = 15 + sum 6 to 10  =  15 + 6  + sum 7 to 10  = 21 + sum 7 to 10  =  21 + 7  + sum 8 to 10  = 28 + sum 8 to 10  =  28 + 8  + sum 9 to 10  = 36 + sum 9 to 10  =  36 + 9  + sum 10 to 10  = 45 + sum 10 to 10  = 45 + 10 = 55  Memory needed  Figure 4.3       A corecursive computation     Corecursion and recursion     87  constant, symbolized by the rectangle at the bottom of the figure. Figure 4.4, on the  other hand, shows how a recursive process can be used to compute the same result.  No  intermediate  result  can  be  evaluated  until  all  steps  are  developed.  As  a  conse- quence, the memory needed for the recursive computation is much higher; the interme- diate steps must be stacked somewhere before being processed in reverse order.  Using more memory isn’t the worst problem of recursion. What makes the problem  even worse is that computer languages use the stack for storing computation steps. This  is smart because computation steps must be evaluated in reverse order compared to the  order in which they were stacked. Unfortunately, the stack size is limited, so if there are  too many steps, the stack will overflow, crashing the computation thread.  How  many  computation  steps  can  safely  be  pushed  onto  the  stack  is  language-  dependent and can be configured. In Kotlin, it’s about 20,000; in Java, it’s about 3,000.  Configuring the stack size to a higher value might not be a good idea because the same  stack size  but not the same stack area  is used by all threads. And a higher stack size is  often a waste of memory, given that nonrecursive processes use little stack space.  As you see by looking at the two figures, the memory needed for the corecursive  process is constant. It won’t grow if the number of computation steps increases. On  the other hand, the memory needed for the recursive process grows with the number  of steps  and it can be much worse than a linear growth, as you’ll soon see . This is why  you should avoid recursive processes except when you’re sure that the number of steps  will remain low in all cases. As a consequence, you must learn to replace recursion with  corecursion each time it’s possible.  Recursive computation of the sum of the first 10 integers sum 1 to 10  = 10 + sum 1 to 9  = 10 +  9 + sum 1 to 8   = 10 +  9 +  8 + sum 1 to 7    = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 + sum 1 to 6     = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 + sum 1 to 5      = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 +  5 + sum 1 to 4        = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 +  5 +  4 + sum 1 to 3        = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 +  5 +  4 +  3 + sum 1 to 2         = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 +  5 +  4 +  3 +  2 + sum 1 to 1           = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 +  5 +  4 +  3 +  2 + 1         = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 +  5 +  4 +  3 + 3        = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 +  5 +  4 + 6       = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 +  5 – 10      = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 +  6 + 15     = 10 +  9 +  8 +  7 + 21    = 10 +  9 +  8 + 28   = 10 +  9 + 36  = 10 + 45 = 55  Memory needed  Figure 4.4       A recursive computation     88  4.2   chapter  4    Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  Tail Call Elimination At this point, you may have doubts. I said that corecursion uses constant stack space. But you might know that a function calling itself eventually uses stack space, even if it doesn’t have much to push onto the stack. It seems that corecursion would also exhaust the  problem. The trick is to transform a corecursive function into a good old loop. This couldn’t be easier—just replace the corecursive implementation fun toString list: List  : String {  completely   eliminate   although   possible   slowly.   stack,   more   the   to   It   is   fun toString list: List , s: String : String =  if  list.isEmpty     s  else  return toString list, ""   toString list.subList 1, list.size , append s, list[0]    with an imperative loop and mutable references: fun toStringCorec2 list: List  : String {  var s = "" for  c in list  s = append s, c  return s  But don’t worry: Kotlin can automatically translate corecursion into loops for you!  4.2.1   Using Tail Call Elimination Unlike Java, Kotlin implements Tail Call Elimination  TCE . This means that when a function call to itself is the last thing the function does  meaning that the result of this call isn’t used in a further computation , Kotlin eliminates this tail call. But it won’t do it without you asking for it, which you can do by prefixing the function declaration with the fun toString list: List  : String {  keyword:  tailrec  tailrec fun toString list: List , s: String : String =  if  list.isEmpty     s  else  return toString list, ""   toString list.subList 1, list.size , append s, list[0]    Kotlin detects that this function is tail recursive and applies TCE. Again, you must indi- cate that this is your intention. It may seem boring at first, and you might prefer to have Kotlin handle this silently. As you’ll soon discover, thinking that a function imple- mentation is tail recursive when it’s not is a common bug. But if you indicate that your function has a tail-recursive implementation, Kotlin can check the function and let you know if you’ve made a mistake. Otherwise, Kotlin would use a non-tail recursive func- tion and a would potentially occur at runtime. And worse, this could appear only once in production because it depends on the input data.    StackOverflowException  }  }  }                                                                       4.2.2  Switching from loops to corecursion  Tail Call Elimination     89  Using corecursion instead of loops is a paradigm shift. At first, you’ll think in your orig- inal paradigm and then translate it to the new one. Only later will you start thinking  directly in your new paradigm. This is true of all learning, and learning to use corecur- sion instead of loops is no different.  In the previous sections, I presented recursion and corecursion as native concepts.  At this point, a rationale for translating imperative loops into recursive functions will  probably be useful.  But remember that this is only an intermediate step. You’ll soon  learn how to abstract recursion and corecursion in order to avoid manipulating them.  Although you’ve seen that recursion is much less useful than corecursion, due to the  implied memory limitations, recursion has a big advantage: it’s often much simpler to  write. The recursive version of the sum of integers from 1 to 10 can be written as in the  following example, assuming that sum n  means sum of integers from 1 to n: fun sum n: Int : Int = if  n < 1  0 else n + sum n - 1   It couldn’t be simpler. But as you’ve seen, the addition can’t be performed until you  know the result of sum n  -  1 . The state of the computation at this stage has to be  stored on the stack until all steps have been processed. You’ll want to transform this  into a corecursive implementation in order to benefit from TCE. Many programmers  learning  to  use  corecursion  have  problems  with  this  transformation,  although  it’s  straightforward.  Let’s take a break and look at how traditional programmers would solve the prob- lem. Traditional programmers would draw a flowchart of the computation using state  mutation and condition testing. The problem is so simple that they’d probably draw the  flowchart only in their heads, but let’s look at the flowchart  figure 4.5 .  Sum of integers  from 1 to n  var s = 0 var i = 0  No  Add i to s  Add 1 to i  Yes  i > n ?  Return s  Figure 4.5 sum of      first integers  n  A flow chart of the imperative computation of the         90  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  The corresponding imperative implementation is ubiquitous, using what imperative  programmers call control structures such as for or while loops. As Kotlin has no for  loop  at least not the traditional for loop that corresponds to this flowchart , I’ll use a  while loop in this code: fun sum n: Int : Int {     var sum = 0     var idx = 0     while idx <= n  {         sum += idx         idx += 1     }     return sum }  Not a big deal, but this code contains many places where it could go wrong, especially  since I had to translate the flowchart into a while loop implementation. It’s easy to mess  with the conditions. Should it be <= or <? Should i be incremented before or after s?  Obviously, this style of programming is for smart programmers who don’t make these  kinds of mistakes. But for the rest of us, who’d need to write many tests to check for  potential errors, is it possible to write a corecursive implementation doing the same  thing? Sure.  What you can do is replace the variables with parameters added to the function.   Instead of a function sum n , you must write a helper function: `sum n, sum, idx : fun sum n: Int, sum: Int, idx: Int : Int = ...  Then your main function sum n: Int  will call the helper function with the starting  values: fun sum n: Int, sum: Int, idx: Int : Int =        if  idx < 1   sum else sum n, sum + idx, idx - 1   fun sum n: Int  = sum n, 0, n   But, in fact, n will never change. You can benefit from Kotlin local functions to remove  one  parameter,  making  the  helper  function  local  to  the  main  function  and  closing  over the main function parameter. This is a lot easier to do than to describe: fun sum n: Int : Int {     fun sum sum: Int, idx: Int : Int =             if  idx < 1   sum else -sum sum + idx, idx - 1      return sum 0, n  }  As I said earlier, you now need a block function with an explicit  return at the end  of  the  block  and  an  explicit  return  type.  Then,  you  need  to  implement  the  helper  function.   Tail Call Elimination     91  Think about the looping version. On each iteration of the loop, you get modified  versions of the variables: s + i and i + 1. All you have to do is make the helper function  call itself with these modified parameters: fun sum n: Int : Int {     fun sum s: Int, i: Int : Int = sum s + i, i + 1      return sum 0, 0  }  This won’t work because it never terminates. What you’re missing is the terminal con- dition testing: fun sum n: Int : Int {     fun sum s: Int, i: Int : Int = if  i > n  s else sum s + i, i + 1      return sum 0, 0  }  All that’s left to do is to tell Kotlin that you want TCE to be applied to the helper func- tion. You do this by adding the tailrec keyword: fun sum n: Int : Int {     tailrec fun sum s: Int, i: Int : Int =         if  i > n  s else sum s + i, i + 1      return sum 0, 0  }  In case TCE can’t be applied, Kotlin displays a warning: Warning: 16, 5  Kotlin: A function is marked as tail-recursive                         but no tail calls are found  This won’t stop your program from compiling, but it’ll produce code that might over- flow the stack! You should watch such warnings closely. exercise 4.1 Implement a corecursive add function working with positive integers. The implemen- tation of the add function shouldn’t use the plus  +  or minus  -  operators, but only  two functions: fun inc n: Int  = n + 1 fun dec n: Int  = n - 1  Here’s the function signature: fun add a: Int, b: Int : Int  hint You should be able to directly write the corecursive implementation. If not, write an  implementation using a loop and translate it as you’ve done for the sum function. soLution To add two numbers, x and y, you can do the following:  ¡	If y = 0, return x. ¡	Otherwise, add 1 to x, subtract 1 from y, and start again.   92  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  This can be written using a loop as follows: fun add a: Int, b: Int : Int {   var x = a   var y = b   while y != 0  {     x = inc x      y = dec y    }   return x }  Here the condition has been changed to better fit a while loop. It would be possible to  use the original condition but with an ugly result: fun add a: Int, b: Int : Int {   var x = a   var y = b   while true  {     if  y == 0  return x     x = inc x      y = dec y    } }  Also note that unlike Java, Kotlin doesn’t allow using the parameters x and y directly  because parameters can only be val references. You’ll have to make copies. Then all  you have to do is to replace the variables with parameters in a call to the add function: tailrec fun add x: Int, y: Int : Int = if  y == 0  x else add inc x , dec y    In this exercise, you don’t need to mutate anything. Instead of storing the current val- ues in mutable var references, you need to recursively call the function with the new  values as parameters. Now you can call your function with any argument value without  causing a StackOverflowException. As you’ll see soon, writing safer programs often  involves a lot of effort to change a  non-tail  recursive function implementation into a  tail recursive one. And sometimes, it won’t be possible!  4.2.3  Using recursive value functions  As you’ve just seen, defining a recursive function is simple. Sometimes the simplest  implementation is tail recursive, as you saw in the previous example. But this wasn’t a  real example. No one would ever create that sort of function to perform an addition.  Let’s try with a more useful example. The function factorial int n  can be defined  as returning 1 if its argument is 0, and n * factorial n – 1  otherwise: fun factorial n: Int : Int = if  n == 0  1 else n * factorial n - 1   This function, obviously, isn’t tail recursive, so be aware that it’ll overflow the stack if n  is higher that a few thousand. And don’t use this kind of code in production unless you  know for sure that the number of recursion steps will stay low.  Writing recursive fun functions is easy. What about recursive value functions?   Tail Call Elimination     93  4.2  hard   exercise Write a recursive factorial value function.

Put aside this chicken-   and-egg problem for the moment. Converting a single argument function into a value function is straightforward. It uses a lambda with the same implementation as the fun  function:    fun  val factorial:  Int  -> Int =  { n -> if  n <= 1  n else n * factorial n - 1  }  You need to indicate explicitly either the type of the function or the type       NOTE of the lambda argument.  factorial  Now for the tricky part. This code won’t compile because the compiler will complain not being initialized yet. What does this mean? When the about the variable compiler reads this code, it’s in the process of defining the function. During this process, it encounters a call to the factorial function, which isn’t yet defined. This is the same problem as val x: Int = x + 1  factorial  You can solve this problem by first declaring the variable and then changing its value, which can be done in an initializer such as the following: lateinit var x: Int init {  x = x + 1;  }  are   works   before   defined   because   members   initializers   The This  keyword declares that the variable will be initialized later. If you call it before lateinit it’s initialized, you’ll get an exception. But this function allows using a non-nullable type. Without lateinit, you’d be forced to use a nullable type, or to initialize the ref- erence to a dummy value. This trick is totally useless in the previous case, but you can use it to define the factorial function: object Factorial {  executed.   are   lateinit var factorial:  Int  -> Int init {  factorial = { n -> if  n <= 1  n else n * factorial n - 1  }  }  }                                                                         94  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  Another more elegant solution is to use lazy initialization: object Factorial {     val factorial:  Int -> Int by lazy { { n: Int ->         if  n <= 1  n else n * factorial n - 1      } } }  The double braces are mandatory! Lazy initialization is achieved with the following: object Factorial {     val factorial:  Int -> Int by lazy { ... } }  The ... must now be replaced by the lambda, which is nearly the same as in the previ- ous example, including the braces: { n: Int -> if  n <= 1  n else n * factorial n - 1  }  The only difference is that Kotlin is now unable to infer the type of n, so you must write  it explicitly. The only problem with this trick is that the field can’t be declared as a val,  which is annoying because immutability is one of the fundamental techniques for safe  programming. With a var, nothing guarantees that the value of the factorial variable  won’t change later. A solution is to make the var private and then copy its value to a val: object Factorial {     private lateinit var fact:  Int  -> Int     init {         fact = { n -> if  n <= 1  n else n * fact n - 1  }     }     val factorial = fact }  This way, you can be sure that nothing can change the value of factorial once it’s  initialized. But remember, a recursive value function, although it can be tail recursive,  can’t  be  optimized  through  TCE,  so  it  might  overflow  the  stack.  If  you  need  a  tail-  recursive value function, use a function reference.  Also note that this function will not work in any case for values over 16 because it’ll  cause an arithmetic overflow, producing a negative result. Worst, above 33, it’ll produce  a 0 result because multiplying –2,147,483,648  the result of calling the function with  parameter 33  by 34 results in 0. This causes all subsequent results to be 0.  This hap- pens because Kotlin Int values are 32-bit numbers.   4.3  Recursive functions and lists  Recursion and tail recursion are often used to process lists. Such processes generally  involve splitting a list in two parts: the first element, called the head, and the rest of  the list, called the tail. You already saw an example of this when defining a function  converting a list of characters into a string. Consider the following function, which  computes the sum of the elements of a list of integers: fun sum list: List  : Int =         if  list.isEmpty    0 else list[0] + sum list.drop 1     Recursive functions and lists     95  If the list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the value of the first ele- ment  the head of the list  plus the result of applying the sum function to the rest of the  list  the tail of the list . It might be clearer if you define helper functions to return the  head and the tail of a list. You don’t have to restrict these functions to lists of integers  because they can be made to work on any lists: fun   head list: List  : T =         if  list.isEmpty                throw IllegalArgumentException "head called on empty list"          else             list[0]  fun   tail list: List  : List  =         if  list.isEmpty                throw IllegalArgumentException "tail called on empty list"          else             list.drop 1   fun sum list: List  : Int =         if  list.isEmpty                0         else             head list  + sum tail list    Or, even better, you can create the head and tail function as extension functions of  the List class: fun   List .head  : T =         if  this.isEmpty                throw IllegalArgumentException "head called on empty list"          else             this[0]  fun   List .tail  : List  =         if  this.isEmpty                throw IllegalArgumentException "tail called on empty list"          else             this.drop 1   fun sum list: List  : Int =         if  list.isEmpty                0         else             list.head   + sum list.tail     In this example, the recursive call to the sum function isn’t the last thing the function  does. The four last things the function does are as follows:  ¡	Calls the head function ¡	Calls the tail function ¡	Calls the sum function with the result of tail as its argument ¡	Adds the result of head and the result of sum   96  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  This function isn’t tail recursive, so you can’t use the tailrec keyword, and you won’t  be able to use this function with lists of more than a few thousand elements. But you  can rewrite this function in order to put the call to sum in the tail position: fun sum list: List  : Int {     tailrec fun sumTail list: List , acc: Int : Int =             if  list.isEmpty                    acc             else                 sumTail list.tail  , acc + list.head        return sumTail list, 0  }  Here, the sumTail helper function is tail recursive and can be optimized through TCE.  As this helper function will never be used elsewhere, the best place to put it is inside  the sum function.  You could define the helper function alongside the main function. But you’d have to  make the helper function private or internal and the main function public. In such  a case, the call to the helper function by the main function would be a closure. The  primary reasons for preferring a locally-defined helper function over a private helper  function is to avoid name clashes and to be able to close over some parameters of the  enclosing function.  In  languages  that  allow  locally-defined  functions,  a  current  practice  is  to  call  all  helper functions with a single name, such as go or process. This can’t always be done  with nonlocal functions; the names could clash if the argument types were identical. In  the previous example, the helper function for sum was called sumTail.  Another current practice is to call the helper function with the same name as the  main function with an appended underscore, such as sum_. It’s also possible to give the  helper function the same name as the main function because the functions will have a  different signature. Whatever system you choose, it’s useful to be consistent. In the rest  of this book, I’ll use the underscore to denote tail-recursive helper functions.  4.3.1  Using doubly recursive functions  No  book  talking  about  recursive  functions  can  avoid  the  Fibonacci  series  example.  Although it’s totally useless to most of us, it’s ubiquitous because it’s one of the simplest  examples of a doubly recursive function, meaning a function which calls itself twice on  each step. Let’s start with the requirements in case you’ve never met this function.  The Fibonacci series is a suite of numbers in which each number is the sum of the  two previous ones. This is a recursive definition. You need a terminal condition, so the  full requirements are as follows:  ¡	f  0  = 1 ¡	f  1  = 1 ¡	f  n  = f  n – 1  + f  n – 2    Recursive functions and lists     97  This is the original Fibonacci series, in which the first two numbers are equal to 1. Each  number is supposed to be a function of its position in the series. Most programmers gen- erally prefer to start at 0 rather than 1. You’ll often find definitions where f 0  = 0, which  is not part of the original Fibonacci series. Anyway, this doesn’t change the problem.  Why is this function so interesting? Instead of answering this question right now, let’s   try a naive implementation: fun fibonacci number: Int : Int =         if  number == 0  number == 1              1         else             fibonacci number - 1  + fibonacci number - 2   Now you’ll write a simple program to test this function: fun main args: Array   {      0 until 10 .forEach { print "${fibonacci it } "  } }  If you run this test program, you’ll get the first ten Fibonacci numbers: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55  Based on what you know about recursion in Kotlin, you may think that this function  will succeed in calculating f n  for n, up to a few thousands before overflowing the  stack. Well, let’s check it. Replace 10 with 1000 and see what happens. Launch the pro- gram and take a coffee break. When you return, you’ll realize that the program is still  running. It’ll have reached somewhere around 1,836,311,903, which is only the 47th  step  your mileage may vary—you may even get a negative number! , but it’ll never  finish. No stack overflow, no exception—just hanging in the wild. What’s happening?  The problem is that each call to the function creates two recursive calls. To calculate  f n , you need 2n recursive calls. Let’s say your function needs 10 nanoseconds to exe- cute.  Just guessing, but you’ll soon see that it doesn’t change anything.  Calculating  f 5000  will take 25000 × 10 nanoseconds. Do you have any idea how long that is? The  program will never terminate because it would need longer than the expected duration  of the solar system  if not the universe .  To make a usable Fibonacci function, you have to change it so it uses a single tail  recursive call. There’s also another problem: the results are so big that you’ll soon get  an arithmetic overflow, first resulting in negative numbers, and then soon into 0. exercise 4.3 Create a tail-recursive version of the Fibonacci function. hint If you think about a loop-based implementation, as when you created the sum function,  you know that you should use two variables for keeping track of the two previous val- ues. These variables would then translate into parameters for a helper function. These  parameters will be of type BigInteger in order to allow computing big values.   98  chapter  4    Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  soLution Let’s first write the signature of the helper function. It’ll take two as parameters, and one for the original argument, and it’ll return a tailrec fun fib val1: BigInteger, val2: BigInteger, x: BigInteger : BigInteger  BigInteger:  BigInteger  instances  You must deal with the terminal conditions. If the argument is tailrec fun fib val1: BigInteger, val2: BigInteger, x: BigInteger : BigInteger =  0, you return  1:   x == BigInteger.ZERO  -> BigInteger.ONE ...  If the argument is tailrec fun fib val1: BigInteger, val2: BigInteger, x: BigInteger : BigInteger =  1, you return the sum of the two parameters  val2:  val1  and  when {  when {   x == BigInteger.ZERO  -> BigInteger.ONE  x == BigInteger.ONE  -> val1 + val2 ...  Eventually, you have to deal with recursion. To do that, you must do the following:  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  val2  val1.  and make it  Take Create a new Subtract 1 from the argument. Recursively call the function with the three computed values as its arguments.  by adding the two previous values.  val2  Here is the transcription in code: tailrec fun fib val1: BigInteger, val2: BigInteger, x: BigInteger : BigInteger =  when {  }   x == BigInteger.ZERO  -> BigInteger.ONE  x == BigInteger.ONE  -> val1 + val2 else -> fib val2, val1 + val2, x - BigInteger.ONE   and  and  val1  accumulate the results   val2  fib n - 2 . The two parameters accumulator . Here you can rename them For this reason, those are often called acc2. The last thing to do is to create the main function that calls this helper acc1 function with the initial parameters, and put the helper function inside the body of the main function: fun fib x: Int : BigInteger {  fib n - 1    for  and  acc  tailrec fun fib val1: BigInteger, val2: BigInteger, x: BigInteger : BigInteger =  when {  }   x == BigInteger.ZERO  -> BigInteger.ONE  x == BigInteger.ONE  -> val1 + val2 else -> fib val2, val1 + val2, x - BigInteger.ONE   return fib BigInteger.ZERO, BigInteger.ONE, BigInteger.valueOf x.toLong      }  }  }                                                                                 Recursive functions and lists     99  a   in   slightly   different   conditions   This is only one possible implementation.

In any case, the result is impressive, whether it’s the result of the computation  2,090 digits  or the increase in speed due to the transformation of a dual recursive call into a single corecursive one.  manner,   works.   long   Now   you   can   as   as   it   4.3.2   of   use   main   consists   recursion   Abstracting recursion on lists One a list with the result of applying the same process to the rest of the list  the tail .

You could use the same technique to copy a list of any type into a delimited string: fun   makeString list: List , delim: String : String =  when {  }  list.isEmpty   -> "" list.tail  .isEmpty   ->  "${list.head  }${makeString list.tail  , delim }"  else -> "${list.head  }$delim${makeString list.tail  , delim }"  4.4  sum.   makeString  function.

Can you abstract this? You can. The first thing to do is to step back and have a look at  the whole figure. What do you have?  ¡	A function working on a list of elements of a given type, returning a single value   of another type. These types could be abstracted into type parameters T and U.  ¡	An operation between an element of type T and an element of type U, producing a   result of type U. Note that such an operation is a function from a pair  U, T  to a U.  This seems to be different from what you had in the  sum example, but it is indeed  the same, although T and U were the same type  Int . For the string example, T was  Char and U was String. For the makeString function, T was already generic and U was  String. exercise 4.5 Create a generic version of your tail-recursive function that can be used for sum, string,  and makeString. Call this function foldLeft, then write sum, string, and makeString  in terms of this new function. hint You’ll have to introduce the starting value of type  U  for the accumulator  and the  function from  U, T  to U as additional parameters. soLution Here is the foldLeft function implementation and the three modified functions to  use the foldLeft abstraction: fun   foldLeft list: List , z: U, f:  U, T  -> U : U {     tailrec fun foldLeft list: List , acc: U : U =             if  list.isEmpty                    acc             else                 foldLeft list.tail  , f acc, list.head         return foldLeft list, z  }  fun sum list: List   = foldLeft list, 0, Int::plus   fun string list: List   = foldLeft list, "", String::plus   fun   makeString list: List , delim: String  =     foldLeft list, ""  { s, t -> if  s.isEmpty    "$t" else "$s$delim$t" }  The function you created here is one of the most important when programming with- out loops. This function lets you abstract corecursion in a stack-safe way, so that you’ll  seldom have to think about making functions tail recursive. But sometimes you’ll need  to make things in the opposite way, using recursion instead of corecursion.  Suppose you’ve a list of chars [a,  b,  c] and you want to build the string "abc"  using only the head and tail and prepend functions you’ve developed in the previous    Recursive functions and lists     101  section. You can’t access list elements by their index. But you could write the following recursive implementation: fun string list: List  : String =  if  list.isEmpty     ""  else  prepend list.head  , string list.tail      ->  Char  type to type T String  function. You could abstract the  fold- so that the function would return type to so that you U function into prepend with the  function.

Now you can define string you replaced with the generic types: fun string list: List  : String =  foldRight list, "", { c, s -> prepend c, s  }   in terms of  foldRight  by calling it with the values  It’s more idiomatic in Kotlin to write the last argument outside of the parenthesis when this argument is a function. In such a case, no comma is used before the function: fun string list: List  : String =  foldRight list, ""  { c, s -> prepend c, s  }       The  foldRight  NOTE mized using TCE.

Finding other solutions that don’t require reversing a list is  preferable, but not always possible. One such solution is to use a different data struc- ture that allows access from both ends.  Defining a reverse function with a loop-based implementation is easy: iterate back-  ward over the list. You must be careful, though, not to mess with the indexes: fun   reverse list: List  : List  {     val result: MutableList  = mutableListOf        list.size downTo 1 .forEach {         result.add list[it - 1]      }     return result }  But this isn’t the way it’s supposed to be done in Kotlin. Kotlin already has a reversed  function on lists. exercise 4.7 Define a reverse function using a fold. hint Remember that foldRight might overflow the stack when used with long lists, so you  should prefer foldLeft as often as possible. You should also create the prepend func- tion working on the list and adding an element in front of the list. Don’t worry about  performance. This is a problem you’ll address in chapter 5. Make your function work  with immutable lists using the + operator. soLution The prepend function is easy to define, although there’s a little trick. The + operator  in Kotlin allows concatenating lists or adding an element at the end of a list, but not  adding an element to the head of the list. One solution to this problem is to first make  a single item list of the element to prepend: fun   prepend list: List , elem: T : List  = listOf elem  + list  Then, all you need to do to reverse a list is to fold it to the left using this function: fun   reverse list: List  : List  =             foldLeft list, listOf  , ::prepend   This works, but it’s kind of cheating. Could you define the reverse function without  creating this single item list?   Recursive functions and lists     103  4.8  reverse  function using only the append version of  exercise Define the concatenation. hint What you need for this exercise is to define the catenation. Try to start with a function copying a list through a left fold. soLution Copying a list through a left fold is easy: fun   copy list: List  : List  =  prepend  +  foldLeft list, listOf    { lst, elem -> lst + elem }  without resorting to  function while not using con-  prepend  function that adds an element in front of a list can be implemented by The left folding the list, using an accumulator containing the element to add instead of the empty list: fun   prepend list: List , elem: T : List  =  foldLeft list, listOf elem   { lst, elm -> lst + elm }  Now you can use the same fun   reverse list: List  : List  =  reverse  foldLeft list, listOf  , ::prepend   implementation with this new  prepend  function:  Don’t use these implementations of in production code. Both imply traversing the whole list several times, so these are slow. If you’re working with Kotlin lists, use the standard List. In chapter 5, you’ll learn how to create functional immutable lists that perform well on all occasions.  function on  reversed  reverse  prepend  and  thing programmers do again and again is build corecursive lists, and most of these  4.3.4   Building corecursive lists One are lists of integers. Consider the following example in Java: for  int i = 0; i < limit; i++  {     some processing...  }  }  This code is a composition of two abstractions: a corecursive list and some processing. The corecursive list is a list of integers from  excluded . As I’ve said, one way to make programs safer is, among other things, pushing abstraction to the limit so that you can reuse a maximum of code. Let’s abstract the construction of this corecursive list.   included  to  limit  0  Corecursive lists are easy to construct. You start from the first element  int i = 0   and apply the chosen function  i -> i++ .  You could have constructed the list first and then mapped it to a function corre- processing..., or to a composition of functions, or to an effect.  some   sponding to Let’s do this with a concrete limit. Consider this Java example: for  int i = 0; i < 5; i++  {  System.out.println i ;                                                                                       104  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  This is nearly equivalent to the following Kotlin code: listOf 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 .forEach ::println   Both the list and the effect have been abstracted. But you can push abstraction even  further. exercise 4.9 Write a loop-based implementation of a function that produces a list using a starting  value, a limit, and the function x -> x + 1. You’ll call this function range, and it’ll have  the following signature: fun range start: Int, end: Int : List   soLution You can use a while loop to implement the range function: fun range start: Int, end: Int : List  {     val result: MutableList  = mutableListOf       var index = start     while  index < end  {         result.add index          index++     }     return result }  exercise 4.10 Write a generic version of a range-like function that works for any type and any condi- tion. As the notion of range works only for numbers, let’s call this function unfold and  give it the following signature: fun   unfold seed: T, f:  T  -> T, p:  T  -> Boolean : List   soLution Starting from the range function implementation, all you have to do is to replace the  specific parts with generic ones: fun   unfold seed: T, f:  T  -> T, p:  T  -> Boolean : List  {     val result: MutableList  = mutableListOf       var elem = seed     while  p elem   {         result.add elem          elem = f elem      }     return result }  exercise 4.11 Implement the range function in terms of unfold.   Recursive functions and lists     105  soLution There’s nothing difficult here. You need to provide  ¡	The seed, which is the start parameter of range ¡	The function f, which is { x -> x + 1 } or the equivalent { it + 1 } ¡	The predicate p, which resolves to { x -> x < end } or the equivalent { it < end }:  fun range start: Int, end: Int : List  =                 unfold start, { it + 1 }, { it < end }   Corecursion  and  recursion  have  a  dual  relationship.  One  is  the  counterpart  of  the  other, so it’s always possible to change a recursive process into a corecursive one, and  vice versa. For now, let’s do the inverse process. exercise 4.12 Write a recursive version of range based on the functions you’ve defined in previous  sections. hint The only function you need is prepend, although you can choose other implementa- tions using different functions. soLution Defining  a  recursive  implementation  is  extremely  simple.  You  prepend  the  start  parameter  to  the  same  function,  using  the  same  end  parameter  and  replacing  the  start parameter with the result of applying the f function to it. It’s much easier to do  than to explain in words: fun range start: Int, end: Int : List  =     if  end <= start          listOf       else         prepend range start + 1, end , start   exercise 4.13 Write a recursive version of unfold. hint Again, start from the range function recursive implementation and try to generify it. soLution The solution is simple: fun   unfold seed: T, f:  T  -> T, p:  T  -> Boolean : List  =         if  p seed               prepend unfold f seed , f, p , seed          else             listOf    You can now redefine range in term of this function. Be aware, however, that the recur- sive unfold function will blow the stack after a few thousand recursive steps.   106  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  exercise 4.14 Can you make a tail recursive version of this function? Try to answer this question in  theory before doing the exercise. hint Think about this: Is unfold a recursive function or a corecursive one? soLution The unfold function is in fact corecursive, like the foldLeft function you developed  earlier. You might guess that you can make a tail-recursive version using a helper func- tion taking an accumulator as an additional parameter: fun   unfold seed: T, f:  T  -> T, p:  T  -> Boolean : List  {     tailrec fun unfold_ acc: List ,                         seed: T,                         f:  T  -> T, p:  T  -> Boolean : List  =             if  p seed                   unfold_ acc + seed, f seed , f, p              else                 acc     return unfold_ listOf  , seed, f, p  }  The  use  of  a  local  function  allows  simplifying  this  code  by  removing  the  constant  parameters from the helper function  f and p  and making this function close over the  enclosing function parameters: fun   unfold seed: T, f:  T  -> T, p:  T  -> Boolean : List  {     tailrec fun unfold_ acc: List , seed: T : List  =             if  p seed                   unfold_ acc + seed, f seed               else                 acc     return unfold_ listOf  , seed  }  4.3.5   The danger of strictness None  of  these  versions   recursive  and  corecursive   are  equivalent  to  the  for  loop.  This is because even with strict languages like Java and Kotlin  they’re strict regard- ing method or function arguments , the for loop, like most control structures, is lazy.  This means that in the for loop you used as an example, the order of evaluation will  be index, computation, index, computation ..., although using the range function will  first compute the complete list of indexes before mapping the function.  This problem arises because you shouldn’t be using lists for this. Lists are strict data  structures. But you have to start somewhere. In chapter 9, you’ll learn how to use lazy  collections that will solve this problem.   Memoization     107  4.4  Memoization  In section 4.3.1, you implemented a function to display a series of Fibonacci numbers.  One problem with this implementation of the Fibonacci series is that if you want to  print the string representing the series up to f n , you’ll have to compute f 1 , f 2 ,  until f n . But to compute f n , you have to recursively compute the function for all  preceding values. Eventually, to create the series up to n, you’ll have computed f 1 n  times, f 2 n – 1 times, and so on. The total number of computations will then be the  sum of the integers 1 to n.  In this section, you’ll learn how memoization can help. Memoization is the technique  of keeping the result of a computation in memory so it can be returned immediately  if you have to redo the same computation in the future. Can you do better? One possi- bility would be to implement a special function called scan. You’ll do this in chapter 8.  For now, we’ll look at another solution. Could you possibly keep the computed values  in memory so you don’t have to compute them again if they’re needed several times?  4.4.1  Using memoization in loop-based programming  In loop-based programming, you wouldn’t have this problem. The obvious way to pro- ceed would be as follows: fun main args: Array   {     println fibo 10   }  Accumulates the present  result into the  accumulator  the  StringBuffer   fun fibo limit: Int : String =      when {         limit   throw IllegalArgumentException           limit == 1 -> "1"         else -> {             var fibo1 = BigInteger.ONE             var fibo2 = BigInteger.ONE             var fibonacci: BigInteger             val builder = StringBuilder "1, 1"              for  i in 2 until limit  {                 fibonacci = fibo1.add fibo2                  builder.append ", " .append fibonacci                   fibo1 = fibo2                                           fibo2 = fibonacci                                   }             builder.toString           }     }  Stores f n – 1  for the next pass  Stores f n  for the next pass  Although this program concentrates most of the problems that functional program- ming is supposed to avoid or solve, it works, and it’s much more efficient than the func- tional version. The reason is memoization.  As I said, memoization is the technique of keeping the result of a computation in  memory so it can be returned immediately if you have to redo the same computation  in the future. Applied to functions, memoization makes the functions memorize the    108  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  4.4.2  Using memoization in recursive functions  results of previous calls, so they can return the results much faster if they’re called again  with the same arguments.  This might seem incompatible with the principles I exposed previously because a  memoized function maintains a mutable state, which is a side effect. But it isn’t incom- patible because the result of the function is the same when it’s called with the same argu- ment.  You could argue that it’s even more the same because it isn’t computed again!   The side effect of storing the results must not be visible from outside the function. In  traditional programming, because maintaining state is the universal way of computing  results, memoization isn’t even noticed.  Recursive functions often use memoization implicitly. In the example of the recursive  Fibonacci function, you wanted to return the series, so you calculated each number  in the series, leading to unnecessary recalculations. A simple solution is to rewrite the  function in order to directly return the string representing the series. exercise 4.15 Write a tail-recursive function taking an integer n as its argument and returning a string  representing the values of the Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n, separated by a comma  and a space. hint One  solution  is  to  use  an  instance  of  StringBuilder  as  the  accumulator.  String- Builder is a mutable structure, but this mutation won’t be visible from the outside.  Another solution is to return a list of numbers and then transform it into a String.  This solution is easier because you can abstract the problem of the separators by first  returning a list and then writing a function to turn the list into a comma-separated  string. soLution The following listing shows the solution using List as the accumulator.  Listing 4.1    Recursive Fibonacci with implicit memoization  Calls the fibo helper function to get the  list of Fibonacci numbers  The first + sign on this line is the list concatenation  operator; others represent BigIntegers addition.  fun fibo number: Int : String {     tailrec fun fibo acc: List ,                      acc1: BigInteger,                      acc2: BigInteger, x: BigInteger : List  =         when  x  {             BigInteger.ZERO -> acc             BigInteger.ONE -> acc +  acc1 + acc2              else -> fibo acc +  acc1 + acc2 , acc2, acc1 + acc2,                            x - BigInteger.ONE          }     val list = fibo listOf  ,      Memoization     109                      BigInteger.ONE, BigInteger.ZERO, BigInteger.  valueOf number.toLong          return makeString list, ", "   }  fun   makeString list: List , separator: String : String =     when {         list.isEmpty   -> ""         list.tail  .isEmpty   -> list.head  .toString           else -> list.head  .toString   +                   foldLeft list.tail  , ""  { x, y -> x + separator + y }     }  The + sign must be at the end of this line and not at the  beginning of the next line; otherwise the code won’t compile.  Formats the list into a comma-separated string  through a call to makeString. This is only for an  exercise. You could have used the standard Kotlin  list.joinToString  ", "  function instead.  4.4.3  Using implicit memoization  This example demonstrates the use of implicit memoization. Don’t conclude that this  is the best way to solve the problem. Many problems are much easier to solve when  twisted—looked at from another perspective. Let’s twist this one.  Instead of a suite of numbers, you could see the Fibonacci series as a suite of pairs    tuples of two elements . Instead of trying to generate this 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...  you could try to produce this:  1, 1 ,  1, 2 ,  2, 3 ,  3, 5 ,  5, 8 ,  8, 13 ,  13, 21 , ...  In this series, each tuple can be constructed from the previous one. The second ele- ment of tuple n becomes the first element of tuple n + 1. The second element of tuple  n + 1 is equal to the sum of the two elements of tuple n. In Kotlin, you can write a func- tion for this: val f = { x: Pair  ->              Pair x.second, x.first + x.second  }         }  Or using a destructuring declaration, it’d look like this: val f = {  a, b : Pair  -> Pair b, a + b }  To replace the recursive function with a corecursive one, you’ll need two additional  functions: map and iterate. exercise 4.16 Define  the  iterate  function  that  works  like  unfold,  except  instead  of  calling  itself  recursively until a condition is met, it calls itself a given number of times. hint Start  with  a  copy  of  the  unfold  function  and  change  the  last  parameter  and  the  condition.   110  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  soLution Instead of a predicate, the function takes an integer as its third argument: fun   iterate seed: T, f:  T  -> T, n: Int : List  {  The function uses a tail-recursive helper function that’s identical to the one used by  unfold except for the condition: fun   iterate seed: T, f:  T  -> T, n: Int : List  {     tailrec fun iterate_ acc: List , seed: T : List  =             if  acc.size < n                  iterate_ acc + seed, f seed               else                 acc     return iterate_ listOf  , seed  }  exercise 4.17 Define a map function that applies a function  T  -> U to each element of a List ,  producing a List . hint You can define a tail-recursive function or you can define your function in terms of  foldLeft or foldRight. A good idea would be to start from the copy function you cre- ated when defining reverse. soLution An explicitly recursive solution could be fun   map list: List , f:  T  -> U : List  {     tailrec fun map_ acc: List , list: List  : List  =             if  list.isEmpty                    acc             else                 map_ acc + f list.head   , list.tail        return map_ listOf  , list  }  It’s simpler and safer to reuse foldLeft because it abstracts recursion. Recall the copy  function: fun   copy list: List  : List  =         foldLeft list, listOf    { lst, elem -> lst + elem}  All you have to do is to apply the function argument to each element during the copy: fun   map list: List , f:  T  -> U : List  =         foldLeft list, listOf    { acc, elem -> acc + f elem }  exercise 4.18 Define a corecursive version of the Fibonacci function producing a string representing  the first n Fibonacci numbers.   Memoization     111  soLution You need to iterate using a pair of the two first numbers and a function computing the  next pair from the previous one. This will give you a list of pairs. You can then map this  list with a function returning the first element of each pair and convert the resulting  list into a string: fun fiboCorecursive number: Int : String {     val seed = Pair BigInteger.ZERO, BigInteger.ONE      val f = { x: Pair  -> Pair x.second, x.first +   x.second  }      val listOfPairs = iterate seed, f, number + 1      val list = map listOfPairs  { p -> p.first }     return makeString list, ", "  }  4.4.4  Using automatic memoization  Memoization isn’t only used for recursive functions. It can be used to speed up any  function. Think about how you perform multiplication. If you need to multiply 234 by  686, you’ll probably need a pen and some paper, or a calculator. But if you’re asked to  multiply 9 by 7, you can answer immediately, without doing any computation. This is  because you’re using a memoized multiplication.  A memoized function works the same way, although it needs to make the compu- tation once to retain the result. Imagine you’ve a function double that multiplies its  argument by 2: fun double x: Int  = x * 2  You could memoize this function by storing the result into a map. Here’s how it could  be done using traditional programming techniques involving testing conditions and  controlling program flow: val cache = mutableMapOf      Uses a mutable map to store the results  Puts the result   in the map  fun double x: Int  =         if  cache.containsKey x   {              cache[x]          } else {             val result = x * 2              cache.put x, result               result          }  Returns the result  Looks in the map to see if the result has  already been computed  If found, returns the result  If not found, computes the result  that   happens   It  in  abstracted into the val cache: MutableMap  = mutableMapOf    this  computeIfAbsent  particular   function:    testing   case,   and   control   flow   have   already   been  fun double x: Int  = cache.computeIfAbsent x  { it * 2 }  Or you might prefer a value function such as val double:  Int  -> Int = { cache.computeIfAbsent it  { it * 2 } }                                 112  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  But two problems arise:  ¡	You have to repeat this modification for all functions you want to memoize. ¡	The map you use is exposed to the outside.  The second problem is easy to address. You can put the function in a separate object,  including the map, with private access. Here’s an example in the case of a fun function: object Doubler {      private val cache: MutableMap  = mutableMapOf        fun double x: Int  = cache.computeIfAbsent x  { it * 2 } }  You can then use this object each time you want to compute a value: val y = Doubler.double x ;  With  this  solution,  the  map  is  no  longer  accessible  from  the  outside.  You’ve  now  addressed the second problem. What can you do to address the first one?  Let’s start with the requirements. What you need is a way to do the following:  val f:  Int  -> Int = { it * 2 } val g:  Int  -> Int = Memoizer.memoize f   Then you can use the memoized function as a drop-in replacement for the original  one. All values returned by function g are calculated through the original function f  the first time and returned from the cache for all subsequent accesses. By contrast, if  you create a third function val f:  Int  -> Int = { it * 2 } val g:  Int  -> Int = Memoizer.memoize f  val h:  Int  -> Int = Memoizer.memoize f   the values cached by g won’t be returned by h; g and h will use separate caches  unless  you memoize the memoize function! .  The following listing shows the implementation of the Memoizer class, which is quite   simple.  Listing 4.2    The Memoizer class  class Memoizer  private constructor   {      private val cache = ConcurrentHashMap         private fun doMemoize function:  T  -> U :   T  -> U =         { input ->             cache.computeIfAbsent input  {                   function it              }         }  Handles the computation, calling the  original function if necessary      companion object {   Memoization     113          fun   memoize function:  T  -> U :  T  -> U =              Memoizer   .doMemoize function      } }  Returns a memoized version of its  function argument  The following listing shows how this class can be used. The program simulates a long  computation to show the result of memoizing the function.  Listing 4.3    Demonstrating the memoizer  fun longComputation number: Int : Int {      Thread.sleep 1000       return number }  Simulates a long computation  The function to memoize  The memoized function  fun main args: Array   {     val startTime1 = System.currentTimeMillis       val result1 = longComputation 43      val time1 = System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime1     val memoizedLongComputation =         Memoizer.memoize ::longComputation       val startTime2 = System.currentTimeMillis       val result2 = memoizedLongComputation 43      val time2 = System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime2     val startTime3 = System.currentTimeMillis       val result3 = memoizedLongComputation 43      val time3 = System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime3     println "Call to nonmemoized function: result = " +                 "$result1, time = $time1"      println "First call to memoized function: result = " +                 "$result2, time = $time2"      println "Second call to nonmemoized function: result = " +                 "$result3, time = $time3"  }  Running this program produces the following result: Call to non memoized function: result = 43, time = 1000 First call memoized function: result = 43, time = 1001 Second call to nonmemoized function: result = 43, time = 0  You can now make memoized functions out of ordinary ones by calling a single func- tion on Memoizer, but to use this technique in production, you’d have to handle poten- tial memory problems. This code is acceptable if the number of possible inputs is low,  so you can keep all results in memory without causing memory overflow. Otherwise,  you can use soft references or weak references to store memoized values.  4.4.5   Implementing memoization of multi-argument functions As I said before, there’s no such thing in this world as a function with several argu- ments. Functions represent relationships between one set  the source set  and another  set  the target set . They can’t have several arguments. Functions that appear to have  several arguments are either   114  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  ¡	Functions of tuples ¡	Functions returning functions returning functions ... returning a result  In either case, you’re concerned only with functions of one argument, so you can easily  use your Memoizer object.  Using functions of tuples may seem the simplest choice. You could use the Pair or  Triple classes offered by Kotlin, or you could define your own if you need to group more  than three elements. The second option is much easier, but you need to use the curried  version of the functions as you did in the section, “Currying functions”  chapter 3 .  Memoizing curried functions is easy, although you can’t use the same simple form as   previously. You have to memoize each function: val mhc = Memoizer.memoize { x: Int ->                 Memoizer.memoize { y: Int ->                     x + y                 }             }  You can use the same technique to memoize a function of three arguments: val f3 = { x: Int -> { y: Int -> { z: Int -> x + y - z } } }  val f3m = Memoizer.memoize { x: Int ->                 Memoizer.memoize { y: Int ->                     Memoizer.memoize { z: Int -> x + y - z }                 }             }  The following listing shows an example of testing the memoized function with three  arguments.  Listing 4.4    Testing a memoized function with three arguments  val f3m = Memoizer.memoize { x: Int ->     Memoizer.memoize { y: Int ->         Memoizer.memoize { z: Int ->             longComputation z  -  longComputation y  + longComputation x           }     } }  fun main args: Array   {     val startTime1 = System.currentTimeMillis       val result1 = f3m 41  42  43      val time1 = System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime1     val startTime2 = System.currentTimeMillis       val result2 = f3m 41  42  43      val time2 = System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime2     println "First call to memoized function: result = " +                 "$result1, time = $time1"      println "Second call to memoized function: result = " +                 "$result2, time = $time2"  }   Are memoized functions pure?     115  This program produces the following output: First call to memoized function: result = -40, time = 3003 Second call to memoized function: result = -40, time = 0  This output shows that the first access to the memoized function took 6,786 milliseconds,  and the second returned immediately.  On the other hand, using a function of a tuple can seem easier after you define the  Tuple class because you can use a data class for which Kotlin will provide equals and  hashCode functions automatically. The following example shows the implementation  of Tuple4  if you need only Tuple2 or Tuple3, you can use the Pair or Triple classes : data class Tuple4  val first: T,                               val second: U,                               val third: V,                               val fourth: W   The following listing shows an example of testing a memoized function taking Tuple4  as its argument.  Listing 4.5    A memoized function of a Tuple4  val ft = {  a, b, c, d : Tuple4  ->     longComputation a  + longComputation b          - longComputation c  * longComputation d  }  val ftm = Memoizer.memoize ft   fun main args: Array   {     val startTime1 = System.currentTimeMillis       val result1 = ftm Tuple4 40, 41, 42, 43       val time1 = System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime1     val startTime2 = System.currentTimeMillis       val result2 = ftm Tuple4 40, 41, 42, 43       val time2 = System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime2     println "First call to memoized function: result = " +                 "$result1, time = $time1"      println "Second call to memoized function: result = " +                 "$result2, time = $time2"  }  4.5   Are memoized functions pure? Memoizing  is  about  maintaining  state  between  function  calls.  A  memoized  func- tion’s behavior depends on the current state, but it’ll always return the same value for  the same argument. Only the time needed to return the value will be different. The  memoized function is still a pure function if the original function is pure.  A variation in time can be a problem. A function like the original Fibonacci function  needing many years to complete can be called non-terminating, so an increase in time  can create a problem. On the other hand, making a function faster shouldn’t be a real  problem. If it is, there’s a much bigger problem somewhere else!   116  chapter 4  Recursion, corecursion, and memoization  Summary  computation.  ¡	A recursive function calls itself, using this call to itself as an element for further   ¡	Recursive functions push the current computation state onto the stack before   recursively calling themselves.  ¡	The Kotlin default stack size is limited.

The world as you see it is a huge data structure composed of simpler data structures, which are in turn composed of simpler structures. Each time you model something, be it objects or facts, you end up with data structures.  Data structures come in many types. In computing, data structures referring to the multiple occurrences of data of a given common type are generally represented as a whole by the term collections. A collection is a group of data items that have some relationship to each other. In its simplest form, this relationship is that they belong to the same group.  This chapter covers data structures and how to create your own implementation of the singly linked list. Kotlin has its own lists, both mutable and immutable. But the Kotlin immutable list isn’t really immutable, and it doesn’t implement data shar- ing, making operations such as adding and removing elements less efficient. The  117                                 118  5.1   chapter  5     Data handling with lists  immutable list you’ll develop in this chapter is far more efficient for stack operations, and it’s immutable.  How to classify data collections A data structure is a structured piece of data. Data collections are one specific category of data structures. Data collections can be classified from many different points of view. You can class data collections in linear collections, associative collections, and graph collections:  or  true  f o   false  returns  are collections that can be viewed as a function.  collections in which elements are related along a single dimension.  Linear collections are In such a collection, each element has a relationship to the next element. The most common example of a linear collection is the list. o, Associative collections a function according to whether this object belongs to the collection or not. Unlike linear collections, there’s no relationship between the elements of the collection. These collections aren’t ordered, although it’s pos- sible to define an order on the elements. The most common examples of associa- tive collections are the set and the associative array  which is also called a map or a dictionary .

Given an object  5.2   Different types of lists In this chapter, I focus on the most common type of linear collection: the list. The list is the most widely used data structure in programming, so it’s generally used to teach many data structure-related concepts.  IMPORTANT by many other data structures  which may not be collections .  What you’ll learn in this chapter isn’t specific to lists but is shared       Lists can be further classified based on several different aspects, including the following:  Access   —You can access some lists from one end only and others from both ends. Lists can be written from one end and read from the other end. Finally, with some lists, you can access any element using its position in the list, which is also index. called its —In some lists, the elements are read in the same order in which Type of ordering   FIFO  first in, first out .

And some lists allow you to retrieve the elements in a completely different order. Implementation   —The concepts of access type and ordering are strongly related to the implementation you choose for your list. If you choose to represent the list by linking each element to the next, you’ll get a completely different result from the  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡                                                                                           Relative expected list performance     119  access point of view rather than from an implementation based on an indexed  array. Or if you choose to link each element to the next as well as to the previous  one, you’ll get a list that can be accessed from both ends.  Figure 5.1 shows different types of lists offering different kinds of access. This figure  shows the principle behind each type of list, but not the way those are implemented.  5.3  Relative expected list performance  One important criterion when choosing a type of list is the expected performance for  various kinds of operations. Performance is often expressed in Big O notation. This  notation is mainly used in mathematics, but when used in computing, it indicates the  way the complexity of an algorithm changes when responding to a change of input  size. When used to characterize the performance of list operations, this notation shows  how the performance varies as a function of the length of the list. For example, con- sider the following performances:  ¡	O 1 —The time needed for an operation is constant.  You can think of it as   meaning that the time for one element is multiplied by 1 for n elements.   ¡	O log n  —The time for an operation on n elements is the time for one element   multiplied by log n .  ¡	O n —The time for n elements is the time for one element multiplied by n. ¡	O n2 —The time for n elements is the time for one element multiplied by n2.

Unfortunately, this isn’t possible yet. Each type of list offers a different per- formance for different operations. Indexed lists provide O 1  performance for data retrieval and near to O 1  for insertion. Singly linked lists deliver O 1  performance for insertion and retrieval on one end and O n  for the other end.  performance   O 1    types   with   for   all   Choosing the best structure is a compromise. Most often, you’ll seek O 1  perfor- mance for the most frequent operations, and you’ll have to accept O log n   or even O n  for some operations that don’t occur often.  Be aware that this way of measuring performance has a real meaning for structures that can be scaled infinitely. This isn’t the case for the data structures you’ll manipulate because these structures are limited in size by the available memory. A structure with O n  access time might always be faster than another one with O 1  due to this size limitation. If the time for one element is much smaller for the first structure, memory limitation can prevent the second from showing its benefits. It’s often better to have O n  performance with an access time of 1 nanosecond to one element rather than O 1  with an access time of 1 ms.  The latter will be faster than the former only for sizes over 1 million elements.   Trading time against memory space and complexity You saw that choosing an implementation for a data structure is generally a question of trading time against time. You’ll choose an implementation that’s faster on some operations but slower on others, based on which operations are the most frequent. But when trading time, there are other decisions to make.  Imagine you want a structure from which elements can be retrieved in a sorted order, the smallest first. You might choose to sort the elements on insertion, or you might prefer to store them as they arrive and search for the smallest on retrieval only. When deciding which to use, one important criterion would be whether the retrieved ele- ment is systematically removed from the structure. If not, it might be accessed several times without removal. In this case, it would probably be better to sort the elements at insertion time in order to avoid sorting them several times on retrieval. This use case corresponds to what’s called a in which you’re waiting for a given element. You might test the queue many times until the expected element is returned. Such a use case requires that elements be sorted at insertion time.  priority queue  But what if you want to access elements by several different sort orders? For example, you might want to access elements in the same order they were inserted or in the reverse order. The result might correspond to the doubly linked list of figure 5.1. It seems that in such a case, elements should be sorted at retrieval time.  You might favor one order, leading to O 1  access time from one end and O n  from the other end, or you might invent a different structure, perhaps giving O log n   access time from both ends. Another solution would be to store two lists, one in inser- tion order and one in reverse order. This way, you’d have a slower insertion time but O 1  retrieval from both ends. One drawback is that this approach would probably use more memory, so you can see that choosing the right structure might also be a question of trading time against memory space.                                                                                                                     Relative expected list performance     121  But  you  might  also  invent  some  structure  minimizing  both  insertion  time  and  retrieval time from both ends. These types of structures have already been invented,  and you’d only have to implement them, but such structures are much more complex  than the simplest ones, so you’d be trading time against complexity.  5.3.2  Avoiding in-place mutation  Most data structures change over time because elements are inserted and removed. To  handle such operations, you can use two approaches. The first one is update in place.  Update in place consists of changing the elements of the data structure by mutating the  structure itself. This was considered a good idea when all programs were single- threaded   although it wasn’t . It’s even much worse now that all programs are multi threaded. This  doesn’t only concern replacing elements. It’s the same for adding or removing, sorting,  and all operations that mutate the structure. If programs are allowed to mutate data struc- tures, these structures can’t be shared without sophisticated protections that are rarely  done right the first time, leading to deadlock, livelock, thread starving, stale data, and all  sorts of troubles.  Update in place In a 1981 article titled “The transaction concept: virtues and limitations,” Jim Gray wrote:1  Update in place: a poison apple?  When bookkeeping was done with clay tablets or paper and ink, accountants developed  some clear rules about good accounting practices. One of the cardinal rules is double-entry  bookkeeping so that calculations are self-checking, thereby making them fail-fast, meaning  that an error is detected as soon as it is committed, instead of possibly appearing long later,  when checking the result  or not being apparent at all . A second rule is that one never  alters the books; if an error is made, it is annotated and a new compensating entry is made  in the books. The books are a complete history of the transactions of the business...     What’s the solution? Use immutable data structures. Many programmers are shocked  when they first read this. How can you do useful things with data structures if you can’t  mutate them? After all, you often start with empty structures and want to add data to  them. How can you possibly do this if those are immutable?  The answer is simple. As with double-entry accounting, instead of changing what existed  previously, you create new data to represent the new state. Instead of adding an element  to an existing list, you create a new list with the added element. The main benefit is that  if another thread is manipulating the list at insertion time, it’s not affected by the change  because it doesn’t see it. Generally, this conception immediately raises two protests:  ¡	If the other thread doesn’t see the change, it’s manipulating stale data. ¡	If making a new copy of the list with the added element is a time and memory-   consuming process, immutable data structures then lead to poor performance.   1  Jim Gray, “The transaction concept: virtues and limitations,” Technical Report 81.3  Tandem Computers, June 1981 ,  http:  www.hpl.hp.com techreports tandem TR-81.3.pdf.       122  chapter  5     Data handling with lists  Both arguments are fallacious. The thread manipulating the stale data is, in fact, manip- ulating the data as it was when it started reading it. If inserting an element occurs after the manipulation is finished, there’s no concurrency problem. But if the insertion occurs while the manipulation is going on, what would occur with a mutable data structure? Either it wouldn’t be protected against concurrent access, and the data might be cor- rupted or the result false  or both , or some protection mechanism would lock the data, delaying the insertion until after the manipulation by the first thread is complete. In the second case, the end result would be exactly the same as with an immutable structure.  The objection about performance is true if you use data structures implying a whole copy on each modification, which is the case of Kotlin immutable lists. This problem, however, is easy to solve by using special structures implementing data sharing, as you’ll learn in this chapter.  What kinds of lists are available in Kotlin? Kotlin offers two types of lists: mutable and immutable. Both are backed by Java lists but are enhanced with a huge number of functions, thanks to Kotlin’s extension func- tions system.  Mutable lists  work like Java lists. You can mutate a list by adding, inserting, or remov- ing an element; in which case, the previous version of the list is lost. On the other hand, immutable lists can’t be modified, at least through direct operation. Adding an element immutable list creates a copy of the original list with the new element added. to an This  works  because these lists aren’t persistent by nature. They are made to persist using a well-known tech- nique called defensive copy. Although the term defensive copy means making a copy to defend oneself against concurrent mutation from other threads, it can also be applied to defend others from one’s own mutations.  performance   operations   optimal   some   than   well,   less   but   for   is   a   like   stack,   Whether you need more efficient immutable lists than what Kotlin offers is arguable.

In   any   case,  5.4.2   Implementing immutable, persistent, singly linked lists structure of the singly linked list shown in figures 5.1 and 5.2 is theoretical. The The list can’t be implemented that way because elements can’t be linked to one another. They’d have to be special elements to allow these links, and you want your lists to be able to store any element. The solution is to devise a recursive list structure composed of the following:  ¡  ¡  An element that will be the first element of the list, also called the The rest of the list, which is a list by itself and is called the  tail.  head.  already  types:   encountered  A  the  You  ferent  List >.

In such a case, you’d create it as a List   that can be cast into a list of any type. You could define these elements as open class List   object Nil : List     class Cons  private val head: A, private val tail: List  : List     But  there  would  be  a  major  drawback:  anyone  could  extend  the  List  class,  which  might lead to an inconsistent implementation of lists, and anyone could access the Nil  and Cons subclasses, which are implementation details that shouldn’t be made public.  The solution is to declare the List class sealed and define the Nil and Cons subclasses  inside the List class: sealed class List  {      internal object Nil: List         internal class Cons  private val head: A,                            private val tail: List  : List    }  Figure 5.3 shows the complete listing of your first list implementation.

The invoke function declared with the keyword  operator can be called as ClassName  .  In the listing, the List class is implemented as a sealed class. Sealed classes allow defin- ing algebraic data types  ADT , meaning types that have a limited set of subtypes. Sealed  classes are implicitly abstract and their constructor is implicitly private. Here the List  class is parameterized with the parameter type A, which represents the type of the list  elements.  The List class contains two private subclasses to represent the two possible forms  a List can take: Nil for an empty list and Cons for a nonempty one.  The name Cons  means construct.  The Cons class takes as parameters an A  the head  and a List   the    126  chapter 5  Data handling with lists  5.5  Data sharing in list operations  tail . By convention, the toString function always includes NIL as the last element,  so  the  implementation  returns  [NIL].  These  parameters  are  declared  internal  so  that they won’t be visible from outside the file or the module in which the List class is  declared. The subclasses have been made private, so you must construct lists through  calls to the companion object invoke function.  The List class also defines the abstract isEmpty   function, which returns true if  the list is empty and false otherwise. The invoke function, together with the modifier  operator, allows calling the function with a simplified syntax: val List  list = List 1, 2, 3   This isn’t a call to the constructor  the List constructor is private , but to the compan- ion object invoke function. The foldRight function in this listing is a standard Kotlin  function for arrays and collections. You’ve already defined such a function in chapter  4, but you’ll learn more about it later in this chapter.  One of the huge benefits of immutable persistent data structures like the singly linked  list is the performance boost provided by data sharing. You can already see that access- ing the first element of the list is immediate. It’s a matter of accessing the head prop- erty. Removing the first element is equally fast. All you have to do is return the value of  the tail property. Let’s now see how to get a new list with an additional element. exercise 5.1 Implement the function cons, adding an element at the beginning of a list.  Remem- ber cons stands for construct.  hint This function can have the same implementation for both subclasses, so you can define  it as a concrete function in the List class. soLution This function creates a new list that uses the current list as the tail and the new element  as the head: fun cons a: A : List  = Cons a, this   exercise 5.2 Implement setHead, a function for replacing the first element of a List with a new  value. hint You can’t change the head of an empty list, so in such a case, you should throw an  exception.  In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to safely handle this case.  soLution You could implement this function in the List class, taking advantage of the when con- struct and smart casts:   Data sharing in list operations     127  fun setHead a: A : List  = when  this  {  Nil -> throw IllegalStateException "setHead called on an empty list"  is Cons -> tail.cons a   }  }  As you can see, you don’t need to explicitly cast the Cons. This is automatically done by Kotlin. Also note that, thanks to the use of a sealed class, you don’t need an  clause. Kotlin sees that all subclasses are processed.

No. A simple solution consists in declaring an abstract Empty  class and a  Nil  object implementing this class. This would be a better choice if you had  many functions to define, each taking an A argument. But for now, setHead and cons  are the only ones. Furthermore, the cons function can have the same implementation  for both subclasses, so you can keep it like this. In chapter 11, you’ll use an abstract class  with a singleton object implementation to represent empty trees.  You can rely on data sharing to implement various other operations in an efficient  way—often much more efficient than what can be done with mutable lists. In the rest  of this section, you’ll add functionality to the linked list based on data sharing. exercise 5.3 Returning the tail property of a list has the same effect as removing the first element,  although no mutation occurs. Write a more general function, drop, that removes the  first  n elements from a list. This function won’t remove the elements but returns a  new list corresponding to the intended result. This list won’t be anything new because  you’ll use data sharing, so nothing will be created. Figure 5.4 shows how you should  proceed.  The signature of the function is this:  fun drop n: Int : List   In case n is higher that the length of the list, just return an empty list.  You might pre- fer to call this function dropAtMost.  hint You should use corecursion to implement the drop function. You can implement an  abstract function in the List class with two different implementations in Nil and Cons.  Or is there a better solution?  list  The original list is left unchanged by the drop method.  s  e  v  e  n  list.drop 1   The “new” list should simply point to the element n of the original list  starting with 0 .  Figure 5.4    Dropping the n first elements of a list while not mutating or creating anything   More list operations     129  soLution Implementing an abstract function in the List class seems straightforward. Add the  abstract  keyword  in  front  of  the  function  signature.  The  implementation  in  Nil  returns this. A recursive implementation in Cons could be override fun drop n: Int : List  = if  n == 0  this else tail.drop n - 1   But this blows the stack for n higher than a few thousand  somewhere between 10,000  and 20,000 , provided the list is long enough. As you saw in chapter 4, you should  change recursion into corecursion by adding an additional parameter. This seems easy,  and the following solution may come to mind: override fun drop n: Int : List  {   tailrec fun drop n: Int, list: List  : List  =                       if  n <= 0  list else drop n - 1, list.tail      return drop n, this  }  However, this won’t work if n is higher than the length of this list. Using corecursion  prevents the terminal case from being handed to the Nil implementation. In such a  case, you need to explicitly test for Nil and you can’t rely on polymorphism. But not  relying on polymorphism means you don’t have to declare an abstract function in the  List class with two different implementations. The following function in the List class  will do the job: fun drop n: Int : List  {     tailrec fun drop n: Int, list: List  : List  =         if  n <= 0  list else when  list  {             is Cons -> drop n - 1, list.tail              is Nil -> list         }     return drop n, this  }  5.6.1  Benefiting from object notation  Putting functions in classes is a choice. You can also define your function outside the  class at package level. As I’ve mentioned, declaring a function inside a class is exactly  the  same  as  adding  this  to  its  parameters.  You  could,  therefore,  define  the  drop  function as class List  {     ... }  fun   drop aList: List , n: Int : List  {     tailrec fun drop_ list: List , n: Int : List  = when  list  {         List.Nil -> list         is List.Cons -> if  n <= 0  list else drop_ list.tail, n - 1      }     return drop_ aList, n  }   130  chapter 5  Data handling with lists  Then you can see that the helper function is no longer necessary because it has exactly  the same signature as the main function: class List  {     ... }  tailrec fun drop list: List , n: Int : List  = when  list  {     List.Nil -> list     is List.Cons -> if  n <= 0  list else drop list.tail, n - 1  }  One drawback is that you must now declare the Nil and Cons class internal rather  than private because, unlike Java, the enclosing class has no access to private inner or  nested classes. Not a big deal, though. This can be solved by declaring the function in  the class companion object: companion object {      tailrec fun   drop list: List , n: Int : List  = when  list  {         Nil -> list         is Cons -> if  n <= 0  list else drop list.tail, n - 1      }      ... }  With this solution, you can call the function by prefixing its name with the name of the  class, as do Java programmers when calling static functions: fun main args: Array   {     val list = List 1, 2, 3      println List.drop list, 2   }  Alternatively,  you  can  import  the  function.  On  the  other  hand,  instance  functions  are often easier to use than functions defined at the package level or in companion  objects. That’s because instance functions let you compose function calls using object  notation, which is much easier to read. For example, if you want to drop two elements  of a list of integers and then replace the first element of the result with a 0, you can use  package-level functions: val newList = setHead drop list, 2 , 0 ;  Each time you add a function to the process, the function name is added to the left,  and the additional arguments, besides the list itself, are added to the right, as shown in  figure 5.5.  Using object notation makes the code much easier to read:  val newList = list.drop 2 .setHead 0 ;   More list operations     131  val list: Int = ... val list1 = drop list, 2  val list2 = setHead list 1, 0   val list: Int = ... val list1 = list.drop 2  val list2 = list1.setHead 0   list2 = setHead drop list1, 2 , 0   list2 - list.drop 2 .setHead 0   Figure 5.5    Without object  notation  left , composed functions  can be difficult to read. Using  object notation  right  results in  much more readable code.  a   the   best   library   designer,   As  possibilities. Given that you put the function in the companion object, adding an instance version is as simple as fun drop n: Int : List  = drop this, n   probably   option   would   offer   both   be   to   Now you have the best of both worlds. You don’t need a helper function  or you might consider that the function in the companion object is the helper function , and you don’t need a specific implementation in each subclass. If you don’t want the function in the companion object to be accessible from the outside, you can make it private. In this case, you can also put it in the list class, and you’re back at the starting point.  As for the question of which solution to choose, there isn’t a unique answer. It’s up to you to choose the solution that fits your needs or your style. A solution with less code is usually preferable, though, because the more code you have, the more you have to maintain. Besides this, try to minimize the visible parts. exercise 5.4 Implement a long as a condition holds true. Here’s the signature of the function: fun dropWhile p:  A  -> Boolean : List   to remove elements from the head of the  dropWhile  function  List  as  approach,   here’s   how   to   implement   the  you   chose   soLution Assuming  helper function: private tailrec fun   dropWhile list: List ,  companion   object   the   Nil -> list is Cons -> if  p list.head   dropWhile list.tail, p  else list  p:  A  -> Boolean : List  = when  list  {  }  The following instance function in the fun dropWhile p:  A  -> Boolean : List  = dropWhile this, p   class calls the helper function:  List  5.6.2   Concatenating lists A common operation on lists consists in adding one list to another to form a new list containing all elements of both lists. It would be nice to be able to link both lists, but this isn’t possible. The solution is to add all elements of one list to the other list. But                                                                                             132  chapter 5  Data handling with lists  elements can only be added to the front  head  of the list, so if you want to concate- nate list1 to list2, you must start by adding the last element of list1 to the front of  list2, as indicated in figure 5.6.  One way to proceed is to first reverse list1, producing a new list, and then add each  element to list2, this time starting from the head of the reversed list. But you haven’t  yet defined a reverse function. Can you still define concat? Yes, you can. Consider how  you could define this function:  ¡	If list1 is empty, return list2. ¡	Else return the addition of the first element  list1.head  of list1 to the con-  catenation of the rest of list1  list1.tail  to list2.  This recursive definition can be translated into the following code: fun   concat list1: List , list2: List  : List  = when  list1  {     Nil -> list2     is Cons -> concat list1.tail, list2 .cons list1.head  }  You can add an instance function in List, calling the companion object version with  this as its first argument: fun concat list: List  : List  = concat this, list   The beauty of this solution  for some readers  is that you don’t need a figure to expose  how  it  works  because  it  isn’t  working.  It’s  a  mathematical  definition  translated  into  code.  The main drawback of this definition  for other readers  is that, for the same reason,  it can’t easily be represented in a figure. This can sound like humor, but it’s not. This   list1  6  a  a  5  _  _  4  l  l  3  o  o  2  n  n  1  g  g  nil  Numbers represent the order of the operations.  a  _  l  i  s  t  nil  list3 = list1.concat list2.drop 1   list2  list2.drop 1        Figure 5.6 Sharing data by concatenation. You can see that both lists are preserved and that list2 is shared by the resulting list. But you can also see that you can’t proceed exactly as is indicated in the figure because you’d have to access the last element of list1 first. This isn’t possible because of the list’s structure.         More list operations     133  solution doesn’t represent the process of concatenating lists  from which you could  draw a flowchart . It expresses the result directly in the form of an expression. And this  code doesn’t compute the result. It’s the result!  NOTE    Programming with functions as a replacement for control structures  most often involves thinking in terms of what the intended result is rather  than how to obtain it. Functional code is a direct translation of a definition  into code.  Obviously,  this  code  will  overflow  the  stack  if  list1  is  too  long,  although  you’ll  never have a stack problem with the length of list2. The consequence is that you  won’t have to worry if you’re careful to only add small lists to the front end of lists of  any length.  An important point to note is that what you’re doing is adding elements of the first  list in reverse order to the front of the second list. This is obviously different from the  commonsense understanding of concatenation: adding the second list to the tail of the  first one. This is definitely not how it works with the singly linked list.  If you need to concatenate lists of an arbitrary length, you might think you need to  apply what you learned in chapter 4 to make the concat function stack safe—replace  recursion with corecursion. Unfortunately, this isn’t possible. As a consequence, this  approach is limited by the stack size. You’ll later see how you can solve the problem by  trading  stack  memory space for time. For now, if you think of what you’ve done, you  might guess that there’s more room left for abstraction here. What if the concat func- tion were only a specific application of a much more general operation? Maybe you  could abstract this operation, make it stack safe, and then reuse it to implement many  other operations? Wait and see!  You may have noticed that the complexity of this operation  and hence, the time it’ll  take to be executed by Kotlin  is proportional to the length of the first list. If you con- catenate list1 and list2 of length n1 and n2, the complexity is O n1 , which means  it’s independent from n2. Depending on n1 and n2, this operation can be much more  efficient than concatenating two mutable lists in imperative programming.  5.6.3  Dropping from the end of a list  It’s sometimes necessary to remove elements from the end of a list. Although the singly  linked list isn’t the ideal data structure for this kind of operation, you must still be able  to implement it. exercise 5.5 Write a function to remove the last element from a list. This function should return the  resulting list. Implement it as an instance function with the following signature: fun init  : List   You may be wondering why this is called init instead of something like dropLast. The  term comes from Haskell  http:  zvon.org other haskell Outputprelude init_f.html .   134  chapter 5  Data handling with lists  hint There  might  be  a  way  to  express  this  function  in  terms  of  another  one,  and  one  I’ve already spoken about. Maybe now would be the right time to create the helper  function. soLution To remove the last element, you need to traverse the list  from front to back  and build  up the new list  from back to front  because the last element in a list must be Nil. This  is a consequence of the way lists are created with Cons objects. This results in a list with  the elements in reverse order, so the resulting list must be reversed. That means you  only have to implement a reverse function: tailrec fun   reverse acc: List , list: List  : List  =     when  list  {         Nil -> acc         is Cons -> reverse acc.cons list.head , list.tail      }  This code is the implementation in the companion object. And next is the instance  function in List calling it with this: fun reverse  : List  = reverse List.invoke  , this   Note that you can’t use the List   syntax to call the invoke function without an argu- ment.  You  must  explicitly  call  it;  otherwise,  Kotlin  thinks  you’re  calling  a  construc- tor and throws an exception because the List class is abstract. Remember, you can  choose a different organization, such as putting the helper function inside the calling  function: fun reverse  : List  {     tailrec fun   reverse acc: List ,                             list: List  : List  = when  list  {         Nil -> acc         is Cons -> reverse acc.cons list.head , list.tail      }     return reverse List.invoke  , this  }  With the reverse function, you can implement init easily: fun init  : List  = reverse  .drop 1 .reverse    This  is  the  implementations  for  the  Cons  class.  In  the  Nil  class,  the  init  function  throws an exception.  5.6.4  Using recursion to fold lists with higher-order functions  HOFs   In chapter 4, you learned how to fold lists; folding applies to persistent lists as well. But  with mutable lists, you can choose to implement these operations through iteration or  recursively. With persistent lists, there’s no reason to use the iterative approach. Let’s  consider common folding operations on lists of numbers.   More list operations     135  exercise 5.6 Write a function to compute the sum of all elements of a persistent list of integers using  recursion. The implementation can be put in the companion object of List or at pack- age level in the same file if you make the subclasses internal instead of private. Put- ting it at package level might seem more appropriate because it’s specific to List . soLution The recursive definition of the sum of all elements of a list is this:  ¡	0 for an empty list ¡	head + sum of tail for a nonempty list  The way to express this in Kotlin is as follows: fun sum ints: List  : Int = when  ints  {     Nil -> 0     is Cons -> ints.head + sum ints.tail  }  But this won’t compile because Nil is not a subtype of List .  5.6.5  Using variance  The problem you’re having is that although the  Nothing type is a child of all types   Int included , you can always upcast a Nothing into any other type, but you can’t cast  a List  into a List . If you remember what you learned in chapter 2,  this is due to the fact that List is invariant in A. To make it work as expected, you must  make List covariant in A, which means you have to declare it as List : sealed class List  { ...  If you do this, the List class no longer compiles, displaying the following error mes- sage  many similar errors occur in other lines : Error: 7, 17  Kotlin: Type parameter A is declared as 'out'                             but occurs in 'in' position in type A  The error points to the following line: fun cons a: A : List  = Cons a, this   This means that the List class can’t contain functions having a parameter of type A.  The parameter is an input for the function, so it’s in the in position. Functions can  only have an A as their return type  the out position . understanding variance To understand variance, you can think about a basket of apples. You can perform two  main kinds of operations regarding this basket:  ¡	Put an apple into the basket ¡	Take an apple out of the basket   136  chapter  5     Data handling with lists  Apple  is a Fruit is an  Fruit is not an Apple  An true.

On the other hand, if you need a  Basket  isn’t a  Apple  of  Apple. But if you want a  Gala, you can’t do that because the  Fruit  Fruit, you can take it Basket  because it out of might  Apple.  But what about an empty  Basket? Wouldn’t it be useful to be able to say that it’s empty of anything you need?

Unlike  You could use an empty basket of  Object . But although you’d be able to put anything into the empty basket, you couldn’t  usefully  take anything out of it because you’d never know what type of object you’d get. The Kotlin solution for this problem is the Any, which is the parent type of every other type,   the Kotlin equivalent of Java  Nothing parameter Apple. Conversely, a  is a child type of all types. out, you’re saying that a List   List  isn’t a  is also a Absence of.  List  is also a  List . A List   By declaring the A is an  Tiger.

But here you’re wrong. It’s not okay at all.

Now, you can apply the same technique for functions setHead and concat: sealed class List  {      fun setHead a: @UnsafeVariance A : List  = when  this  {         is Cons -> Cons a, this.tail          Nil -> throw IllegalStateException "setHead called on an empty list"      }      fun cons a: @UnsafeVariance A : List  = Cons a, this       fun concat list: List  : List  = concat this, list       ...  You only need to do this for functions taking a parameter of type A, or List . You  don’t need to do this for functions taking no parameters, nor for the dropWhile func- tion taking a parameter of type  A  -> Boolean. But you also must ensure that when  using  this  trick,  no  unsafe  cast  will  ever  fail.  As  usual,  with  greater  freedom  comes  greater responsibility.  Note that there’s another possibility that consists in creating an Empty  abstract  class for representing empty lists and then creating a Nil  singleton object.  This lets you define abstract functions in the List parent class with specific implemen- tation in Cons or Empty. Here’s how the concat function could be defined: sealed class List  {      abstract fun concat list: List  : List       abstract class Empty  : List    {          override fun concat list: List  : List  = list     }      private object Nil : Empty         private class Cons  private val head: A,                           private val tail: List   : List    {          override fun concat list: List  : List  =                 Cons this.head, list.concat this.tail       } }  This solution may be more appealing to former Java programmers because it avoids  checking for types as in this example: fun   concat list1: List , list2: List  : List  = when  list1  {     Nil -> list2     is Cons -> Cons list1.head, concat list1.tail, list2   }   More list operations     139  In any case, thanks to using out variance, your sum function is now perfectly fine! exercise 5.7 Write  a  function  to  compute  the  product  of  all  elements  of  a  list  of  doubles  using  recursion. soLution The recursive definition of the product of all elements of a nonempty list is this: head * product of tail  But what should it return for an empty list? If you remember your math courses, you’ll  know the answer. If you don’t, you can find the answer in the preceding requirement  for a nonempty list.  Consider  what  will  happen  when  you’ve  applied  the  recursive  formula  to  all  ele- ments. You’ll end up with a result that’ll have to be multiplied by the product of all  elements of an empty list. Because you want to eventually get this result, you have no  choice but to say that the product of all elements of an empty list is 1.  This is the same situation as with the sum example, when you use 0 as the sum of all  elements of an empty list. 0 is the identity, or neutral element, for the sum operation,  and 1 is the identity, or neutral element, for the product. Your product function could  be written as follows: fun product ints: List  : Int = when  ints  {     List.Nil  -> 1     is List.Cons -> ints.head * product ints.tail  }  The  product  operation  is  different  than  the  sum  operation  in  one  important  way:   it has an absorbing element, which is an element that satisfies the following condition:   a * absorbing element = absorbing element * a = absorbing element.  The absorbing element for multiplication is 0. By analogy, the absorbing element of  any operation  if it exists  is also called the zero element. The existence of a zero element  lets you escape the computation, also called short circuiting, like this: fun product ints: List  : Double = when  ints  {     List.Nil  -> 1.0     is List.Cons -> if  ints.head == 0.0                          0.0                     else                         ints.head * product ints.tail  }  But forget about this optimized version and look at the definitions for sum and product.  Can you detect a pattern that could be abstracted? Let’s look at those functions side-by- side  after having changed the parameter name :   140  chapter 5  Data handling with lists  fun sum ints: List  : Int = when  ints  {     List.Nil  -> 0     is List.Cons -> ints.head + sum ints.tail  }  fun product ints: List  : Double = when  ints  {     List.Nil  -> 1.0     is List.Cons -> ints.head * product ints.tail  }  Now let’s remove the differences and replace them with a common notation: fun sum list: List  : Type = when  list  {     List.Nil  -> identity     is List.Cons -> list.head operator operation list.tail  }  fun product list: List  : Type = when  list  {     List.Nil  -> identity     is List.Cons -> ints.head operator operation list.tail  }  The two functions are the same with some different values for Type, operation, iden- tity, and operator. If you can find a way to abstract these common parts, you’ll have  to  provide  the  variable  information  in  order  to  implement  both  functions  without  repeating yourself. This common function is what is called a fold, which you studied in  chapter 4. In that chapter, you learned that there are two kinds of folds: foldRight and  foldLeft, as well as a relationship between these two operations.  Listing 5.2 shows the common parts of the sum and product operations abstracted  into a function called foldRight, taking as its parameters the list to fold, an identity ele- ment, and a HOF  Higher Order Function  representing the operation used to fold the  list. The identity element is obviously the identity for the given operation, and the func- tion is in curried form.  See chapter 3 if you don’t remember what curried means.  The  following listing shows the function that represents the operator portion of your code.  Listing 5.2    Implementing foldRight and using it for sum and product  A and B represent the types.  The identity for the folding operation  fun   foldRight list: List ,                       identity: B,                       f:  A  ->  B  -> B : B =      when  list  {         List.Nil -> identity         is List.Cons -> f list.head  foldRight list.tail, identity, f       }  The function f in curried form,  representing the operator  fun sum list: List  : Int =      foldRight list, 0  { x -> { y -> x + y } }  The names  sum and product   of the operations  fun product list: List  : Double =      foldRight list, 1.0  { x -> { y -> x * y } }   More list operations     141  The Type variable part has been replaced with two types here, A and B. This is because  the result of the folding isn’t always of the same type as the elements of the list. Here  it’s abstracted a bit more than what’s needed for the sum and product operations, but  this will be useful soon. The operation variable part is the names of the two functions. The fold operation isn’t specific to arithmetic computations. You can use a fold to  transform a list of characters into a string. In such a case, A and B are two different types:  Char and String. But you can also use a fold to transform a list of strings into a single  string. Can you see now how you could implement concat?  By the way, foldRight is similar to the singly linked list itself. If you think of the list   1, 2, 3 as Cons 1, Cons 2, Cons 3, Nil     you can immediately see that it’s similar to a right fold: f 1, f 2, f 3, identity     But perhaps you’ve already realized that Nil is the identity list concatenation, although  you could do without it, provided the list of lists to be concatenated isn’t empty. In such  a case, it’s called a reduce rather than a fold. This is possible only because the result is  of the same type as the elements. It can be put in practice by passing Nil and cons to  foldRight as the identity and the function that’s used to fold: foldRight List 1, 2, 3 , List    { x: Int ->         { y: List  ->             y.cons x          }     }  This produces a new list with the same elements in the same order, as you can see by  running the following code: println foldRight List 1, 2, 3 , List    { x: Int ->         { y: List  ->             y.cons x          }     }   This code produces the following output: [1, 2, 3, NIL]  Here’s a trace of what’s happening at each step: foldRight List 1, 2, 3 , List  , x -> y -> y.cons x  ; foldRight List 1, 2 , List 3 , x -> y -> y.cons x  ; foldRight List 1 , List 2, 3 , x -> y -> y.cons x  ; foldRight List  , List 1, 2, 3 , x -> y -> y.cons x  ;  You should put the  foldRight function in the companion object, and then add an  instance function with this as its argument that calls foldRight in the List class: fun   foldRight identity: B, f:  A  ->  B  -> B : B =             foldRight this, identity, f    142  chapter 5  Data handling with lists  exercise 5.8 Write a function to compute the length of a list. This function will use the foldRight  function. soLution This function can be defined directly in the List class: fun length  : Int = foldRight 0  { _ -> { it + 1} }  As its first parameter, representing an element of the list, is unused, the convention is  to name it _. The second parameter is represented by it. At each step of the recursion,  1 is added to the count. When a parameter is unused, you can also remove it. The code  then becomes this: fun length  : Int = foldRight 0  { { it + 1} }  This implementation, besides being recursive  meaning it could overflow the stack for  long lists , has poor performance. Even if transformed to corecursive, it’s still 0 n ,  meaning the time needed to return the length is proportional to the length of the list.  In the next chapters, you’ll see how to get the length of a linked list in constant time. exercise 5.9 The foldRight function uses recursion, but it’s not tail recursive, so it’ll rapidly over- flow the stack. How rapidly depends on several factors, the most important of which  is the size of the stack. Instead of using foldRight, create a foldLeft function that’s  corecursive and stack safe. Here’s its signature: public   foldLeft identity: B, f:  B  ->  A  -> B : B  hint If  you  don’t  remember  the  difference  between  foldLeft  and  foldRight,  refer  to  chapter 4. soLution The helper function implementation in the companion object is similar to the fold- Right function, although the parameter function type is  B   ->   A   ->  B  instead  of  A  ->  B  -> B . If the list received as the second parameter is Nil  empty list ,  the foldLeft function returns the acc accumulator, exactly as the foldRight function  does. If the list isn’t empty  Cons , the function calls itself after having applied the  parameter function to the accumulator and the head of the list parameter: tailrec fun   foldLeft acc: B, list: List , f:  B  ->  A  -> B : B =     when  list  {         List.Nil -> acc         is List.Cons -> foldLeft f acc  list.head , list.tail, f      }  This helper function is called by the main function in the List class: fun   foldLeft identity: B, f:  B  ->  A  -> B : B =             foldLeft identity, this, f    More list operations     143  exercise 5.10 Use your new foldLeft function to create new stack-safe versions of sum, product, and  length. soLution This is the sum via foldLeft function: fun sum list: List  : Int = list.foldLeft 0, { x -> { y -> x + y } }   The product via foldLeft function is as follows: fun product list: List  : Double =         list.foldLeft 1.0, { x -> { y -> x * y } }   And here’s the length via foldLeft function: fun length  : Int = foldLeft 0  { { _ -> it + 1} }  Once again, the second parameter of function length  representing each element of  the list on each call of the function  is ignored. The first parameter is represented by  the it keyword. As a result, you can’t remove the underscore parameter without using  an explicit name for the first parameter, such as fun length  : Int = foldLeft 0  { i -> { i + 1} }  This function is nearly as inefficient as the foldRight version and shouldn’t be used in  production code. Although it won’t blow the stack, it’s slow because it must count the  elements of the list each time it’s called. exercise 5.11 Use foldLeft to write a function for reversing a list. hint Be aware of the type of the identity. You’ll have to indicate it explicitly. soLution Reversing a list via a left fold is simple, starting from an empty list as the accumulator  and successively adding each element of the first list to the accumulator through a call  to the cons function: fun reverse  : List  =     foldLeft Nil as List   { acc -> { acc.cons it  } }  As you can see, you need to both specify the parameter type for Nil and to cast it into a  List. Otherwise, Kotlin uses Nil as the return type. In the previous version of reverse,  you used an helper function taking a List as its argument, so the cast occurred implic- itly. You can’t use List   directly because, in the List class, this would be the class  constructor, which is impossible because the class is abstract. Another solution to work  around for this problem is to call the invoke function explicitly: fun reverse  : List  =     foldLeft List.invoke    { acc -> { acc.cons it  } }   144  chapter  5     Data handling with lists  5.6.6   5.12  foldLeft.  foldRight  in terms of  exercise Write hint Use the functions you just implemented. soLution This  foldRight: fun   foldRightViaFoldLeft identity: B, f:  A  ->  B  -> B : B =  implementation   stack-safe,   getting   useful   can   but   for   be   a   this.reverse  .foldLeft identity  { x -> { y -> f y  x  } }  slower,   version   of  foldLeft  Note that you can also define less useful.

Be aware that there’s a trick here, which is why you should make the helper function private. soLution The trick is that you’ll call the helper function with the parameter list reversed.

In the following implementation, note the use of a function reference  x::cons : fun   concatViaFoldLeft list1: List , list2: List  : List  =  list1.reverse  .foldLeft list2  { x -> x::cons }  If you find that using a function reference make the code less readable, you can use a lambda instead: fun   concat list1: List , list2: List  : List  =  list1.reverse  .foldLeft list2  { x -> { y -> x.cons y  } }  the   use   can   also   You  foldRight: fun   concat list1: List , list2: List  : List  =  constructor   directly,   the   list   in   as   implementation   based   on  list1.reverse  .foldLeft list2  { x -> { y -> Cons y, x  } }  it’s   it’s   On   the   list.   5.15  other   hand,   rather   foldLeft  because   stack-safe   corecursive   is less efficient because it must first reverse than  The implementation based on the  first  recursive. exercise Write a function for flattening a list of lists into a list containing all elements of each contained list. hint This operation consists in a series of concatenations. It’s similar to adding all elements of a list of integers, although integers are replaced with lists and addition is replaced with concatenation. Other than this, it’s exactly the same as the soLution Once again, you can use a function reference instead of a lambda to represent the second part of the function:   { x -> { y -> x.concat y  } }: fun   flatten list: List > : List  =  { x -> x::concat }  is equivalent to    function.  sum  list.foldRight Nil  { x -> x::concat }                                                                                                                       146  chapter 5  Data handling with lists  To  make  this  function  stack-safe,  you  can  use  the  coFoldRight  function  instead  of  foldRight: fun   flatten list: List > : List  =         list.coFoldRight Nil  { x -> x::concat }  5.6.7  Mapping and filtering lists  You can define many useful abstractions for working on lists. One abstraction consists  in changing all the elements of a list by applying a common function to them. exercise 5.16 Write a function that takes a list of integers and multiplies each of them by 3. hint Try using the functions you’ve defined up to now. Don’t use  co recursion explicitly.  The goal is to abstract recursion once and for all so you can put it to work without hav- ing to reimplement it each time. soLution You need to apply foldRight with an empty list as the identity value and a function that  adds each element multiplied by 3 to a list: fun triple list: List  : List  =         List.foldRight list, List    { h ->             { t: List  ->                 t.cons h * 3              }         }  You need to set the type explicitly, either for the identity or for the t parameter. This  is due to the limited capability of Kotlin regarding type inference. You might also use  a left fold, which would make the function stack safe, but would also reverse the list, so  you’d need to reverse back the result. exercise 5.17 Write a function that turns each value in a List  into a String. soLution This  operation  can  be  seen  as  concatenating  an  empty  list  of  the  expected  type   List    with  the  original  list,  with  each  element  being  transformed  before  adding it to the accumulator. As a result, the implementation is similar to what you did  with the concat function: fun doubleToString list: List  : List  =     List.foldRight list, List     { h ->         { t: List  ->             t.cons h.toString            }     }   More list operations     147  5.18  exercise Write a general stack-safe function class that lets you modify each ele- ment of a list by applying a specified function to it.

If you  map a function returning a list to a list, you get a list of lists. You can then apply flat- ten to get a single list containing all the elements of the enclosed lists. You’d get the  exact same result by directly applying flatMap.   Summary  ¡	Data structures are one of the most important concepts in programming because   they allow handling multiple data as a whole.  ¡	The singly linked list is an efficient data structure for programming with func- tions. It has the benefit of immutable lists while allowing some modifications,  such as the insertion and removal of an element in the first position in constant   and short  time. That’s because, unlike with Kotlin’s  immutable  lists, these  operations don’t involve copying elements.  ¡	Using data sharing allows for high performance for some operations, although   not for all.  cases.  ¡	You can create other data structures to get good performance for specific use   ¡	You can fold lists by recursively applying functions. ¡	You can use corecursion to fold lists without the risk of overflowing the stack. ¡	Once  you’ve  defined  foldRight  and  foldLeft,  you  shouldn’t  need  to  use    co recursion again to handle lists. foldRight and foldLeft abstract  co recur- sion for you.   6Dealing with optional data  In this chapter ¡	The null reference or “the billion dollar mistake” ¡	Alternatives to null references ¡	Developing an Option data type for optional data ¡	Applying functions to optional values ¡	Composing optional values  Representing optional data has always been a problem in computer programs. The  concept of optional data is simple. In everyday life, it’s easy to represent the absence  of something when this something is stored in a container—whatever it is, it can be  represented by an empty container. For example, an absence of apples can be repre- sented by an empty apple basket. The absence of gasoline in a car can be visualized  as an empty gas tank. But representing the absence of data in computer programs is  a little more difficult.  Most data is represented by a reference pointing to it, so the most obvious way to  represent the absence of data is to use a pointer to nothing. That’s what we call a null  pointer. In Kotlin, a reference is a pointer to a value.  149   150  chapter 6  Dealing with optional data  In most programming languages, references can be changed to point to a new value.  For this reason, the term variable is often used as a replacement for reference. The word  variable is not much of a problem when all references can be later reassigned to a new  value. In such cases, it’s normal to use the term variable as a replacement for reference.  But that can be different when you use references that can’t be reassigned. In such a  case, you end up with two types of variables: those that can vary and those that cannot.  It’s then safer to use the term reference.  Some references can be created null and then changed to point to values. They can  even be changed again to point to null if data is removed. In such cases, it’s safe to call  them variables, meaning variable references.  Conversely, some references can’t be created without making them point to a value,  and once this is done, they can’t be made to point to a different value. Such references  are sometimes called constants. In Java, for example, references are generally variables  unless declared final, which makes them constants. In Kotlin, variable references are  declared with the keyword var, and nonvariable ones, which are also called immutable  references, are declared as val.  At first, you may think that optional data might only be referenced with var. What  would be the point of creating a reference to an absence of data if not to eventually  change this to a reference to some data? But how would you represent the absence of  data? The most common way is to use what’s called a null reference. A null reference is a  reference not pointing to anything, until some data is assigned to it.  In this chapter, you’ll learn how to deal with optional data—absent values that aren’t  the result of an error. I start by discussing problems with the null pointer. After that, I  discuss how Kotlin handles null references and Kotlin’s alternatives to null references.  For the remainder of the chapter, I describe how to create and use the Option type as a  solution for working with optional data. You can use the Option type to compose func- tions even when the data is absent.  Problems with the null pointer One of the most frequent bugs in programs that allow null references is the  Null- PointerException. This exception is raised when an identifier is de-referenced and  found to be pointing to nothing: some data is expected but is found to be missing.  Such an identifier is said to be pointing to null. In this section, you’ll learn about the  problems with using null references.  In 1965, when designing ALGOL  an object-oriented language , Tony Hoare invented   the null reference. He later came to regret it. Here’s what he said about it in 2009:1 I call it my billion-dollar mistake.... My goal was to ensure that all use of references should  be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t  resist the temptation to put in a null reference because it was so easy to implement. This has  led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused  a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.    1  Tony Hoare, “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake”  QCon, August 25, 2009 , .infoq.com presentations Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare.  http:  www     6.1        Problems with the null pointer     151  Although by now it should be common knowledge to avoid the null reference, that’s  far from being the case. The Java standard library, which is also used in Kotlin pro- grams, contains methods and constructors taking optional parameters that must be set  to null if the parameters are absent. Take, for example, the java.net.Socket class.  This class defines the following constructor: public Socket String address,               int port,               InetAddress localAddr,               int localPort  throws IOException  According to the documentation,2  “If the specified local address is null, it is the equivalent of specifying the address as the  local address.”  Here, the null reference is a valid parameter. This is sometimes called a business null.  This way of handling the absence of data isn’t specific to objects. The port can also be  absent; but in Java, it can’t be null because it’s a primitive:  A local port number of zero will let the system pick up a free port in the bind operation.  This kind of value is sometimes called a sentinel value. It’s not used for the value itself  it  doesn’t mean port 0 , but it’s used to specify the absence of a port indication. You can  find many other examples of handling the absence of data in the Java standard library. The use of  null to represent absence of data is dangerous because the fact that  the local address is null could be unintentional and due to a former error. But this  use won’t cause an exception. The program will continue working, although not as  intended.  There are other cases of business nulls. If you try to retrieve a value from a HashMap  using a key that’s not in the map, you’ll get a null. Is this an error? You don’t know. It  might be that the key is valid but hasn’t been registered in the map, or it might be that  the key is supposedly valid and should be in the map, but there was a previous error  while computing the key. For example, the key could be null, whether intentionally or  due to an error, and this won’t raise an exception. It could even return a non-null value  because the null key is allowed in a HashMap. This situation is a complete mess. As a pro- fessional programmer, you know what to do about this:  ¡	You know that you should never use a reference without checking whether it’s  null or not.  You do this for each object parameter received by a function, right?  ¡	You  know  that  you  should  never  get  a  value  from  a  map  without  first  testing   whether the map contains the corresponding key.  ¡	You know that you should never try to get an element from a list without verifying  first that the list isn’t empty and that it has enough elements if you’re accessing  the element through its index.   2  See  https:  docs.oracle.com en java javase 11 docs api java.base java net Socket.html.       152  chapter    6  Dealing with optional data     or an  NullPointerException  If you do either of these, you never get a IndexOutOf- BoundsException, and you can live with null references without any specific protec- tion. But if you happen to forget and sometimes get these kinds of nasty exceptions, you might want an easier and safer way of dealing with the absence of a value, whether intentional or resulting from an error. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to deal with optional data. absent values that aren’t the result of an error. This kind of data is called There are always tricks for dealing with optional data. One of the best known and most often used is the list. When a function is supposed to return either a value or nothing, some programmers use the list as the return value. The list can contain 0 or 1 element. Although this works quite well, it has several important drawbacks:  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  There’s no way to ensure that the list contains at most one element. What should you do if you receive a list of several elements? How can you distinguish between a list that’s supposed to hold at most one ele- ment and a regular list? The several elements. These functions are useless for your use case. Lists are complex structures, and you don’t need this. A much simpler imple- mentation is sufficient.  class defines many functions to deal with the fact that lists can contain  List  6.2   val   constant  or a  How Kotlin handles null references In chapter 2, you learned how Kotlin handles null references. Normal types in Kotlin can’t be null. If a reference is given this kind of type, it can never be null, whether it be a var, on the other hand, might seem useful. Sometimes you might want to declare a reference of a given type without having any value assigned to it. But you must still declare the reference at some point in order to put it in the right scope. Consider the following example: while enumeration.hasNext    {  would make little sense. A null   variable . A null  val  var  result = process result, enumeration.next     } use result   } use result   In this example, elements of an enumeration are combined inside a loop that’s exe- cuted until there are no more elements. Where would you declare and what initial value would you give it? One solution that comes to mind is to process the first enumeration value outside of the loop: var result = process enumeration.next    while enumeration.hasNext    {  result  result = process result, enumeration.next     But this would cause an error if the enumeration has no element. The common solu- tion is to declare the  reference as  result  null:                                                                                           Alternatives to null references     153  var result = null while enumeration.hasNext    {  result = process result, enumeration.next     } use result   process  Now, the is case, it was overloaded with a version taking a single argument.

This won’t prevent accept the responsibility for doing so. It’s like a disclaimer: if you use the refer- ence, you’re on your own. Kotlin’s compiler can assist you in many ways, which is great for programmers using mutable references. Programmers avoiding mutations, on the other hand, don’t use null references. But the way Kotlin represents nullable types is still a great help for safe programming. With Kotlin, programmers can ensure there will never be any null references in their code.  See chapter 2 for a short description of the differences between nullable and non-nullable types in Kotlin.   null  As you may remember from chapter 2, references of regular types can’t be set to null. If you want to be able to set references to null, you need to use nullable types. Nullable types are written the same way as regular non-nullable types but with a trailing question mark  ? .

NullPointerException  is a subtype of  arising   String  from   Int?,  Int  Return values are much more of a problem, however. Take the example of a  Map. The  following code won’t compile in Kotlin: val map: Map  = ... val person: Person = map["Joe"]  is   that  over  sugar   is  Map  syntactic   map["Joe"]  must return either a  The  reason    get "Joe", or function of nothing. How could a function return nothing? By returning null. Even if you strive to ban null references from your own code, you’ll always end up getting some from the libraries you use. You could, however, use no libraries except those you own. This is a solution, but it involves much work. Another solution is to wrap function calls return- ing  in some wrapper function returning something else. But what?  Person, if one was found for the key  map.get "Joe" ,   and   null  the  6.3                                                                                                                                                                          154  chapter    6  Dealing with optional data  Using libraries isn’t the only possible cause of the problem. The following code is an  example of a function returning optional data: fun mean list: List  : Double = when {  list.isEmpty   -> TODO "What should you return?"  else -> list.sum  .toDouble     list.size  is   of   an     mean  function  example   The It’s defined for all lists of numbers except the empty list. How should you handle the empty list case? One possibility is to return a sentinel value. What value could you choose?

So far so good, but  ¡  ¡  ¡  What if you need to apply the same principle to a function returning an There’s no equivalent to the How can you signal to the user of your function that it could return a sentinel value?

Int  NaN  fun   f list: List  : U = when {  list.isEmpty   -> ??? else -> ...  some computation producing a U   Another solution is to throw an exception: fun mean list: List  : Double = when {  list.isEmpty   -> throw IllegalArgumentException "Empty list"  else -> list.sum  .toDouble     list.size  But this solution is ugly and creates more trouble than it solves:  ¡  ¡  ¡  Exceptions are generally used for erroneous results, but here there’s no error. There’s no result and that’s because there’s no input data! Or should you con- sider calling the function with an empty list a bug? What exception should you throw? A custom one? Or a standard one? The function is no longer a pure function, and it’s no longer composable with other functions. In order to compose it, you need to resort to control structures like  try..catch, which are nothing other than a modern form of  goto.  You could also return fun mean list: List  : Double? = when {  and let the caller deal with it:  null  list.isEmpty   -> null else -> list.sum  .toDouble     list.size  }  }  }  }  }                                                                                                     Alternatives to null references     155  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  In common languages, returning sequence in a language like Java:  null  is the worst possible solution.

It forces the caller to handle the It won’t crash on boxing because Kotlin doesn’t have primitive types, hence no boxing  at least at the user level . It offers operators that allow composing functions returning a nullable type in a safe way.  See chapter 2 for details.  Although it doesn’t prevent propagation of the problem, it makes the problem less crucial by propagating the obligation to handle it.  As I said earlier, the Kotlin solution is better than the absence of a solution you have to deal with in other languages, but it’s still far from ideal. A better solution would be to ask the user to provide a special value that’ll be returned if no data is available. For example,  the Int?, but handles the case of an empty list so List.max   that you can make your function return fun max list: List , default: Int : Int = when {  function of Kotlin, returning  maximum   computes   following   instead of  function   value   Int?:  uses   list.   the   the   Int  of   It   a   list.isEmpty   -> default else -> list.max    }  But this won’t compile because but Kotlin doesn’t see that.  You know that the Kotlin idiomatic solution is fun max list: List , default: Int : Int = list.max   ?: default  returns type is  list.max    Int?.  It won’t ever be    null  But what if you don’t have a default value? Sometimes, a default value will be provided later. Or you’ll want to apply an effect to the result if there’s a value and do nothing otherwise. Look at the following example using the previous val max = max listOf 1, 2, 3 , 0   function:  max  println "The maximum is $max"   If the list is empty, this prints After all, the maximum is not 0; there is no maximum. You could write val max = max listOf 1, 2, 3 , 0   The Maximum is 0, which might not be the correct output.  print if  max != 0  "The maximum is $max\n" else ""                                                                                                              156  chapter 6  Dealing with optional data  But this would be incorrect if the list was to contain only 0 s . You can use the tradi- tional form: val max = listOf 1, 2, 3 .max    if  max != null  println "The maximum is $max"   But now you have to deal with null references again. There has to be a better solution!  6.4  Using the Option type  In the remainder of this chapter, you’ll create the Option type for dealing with optional  data. The Option type you compose will be similar to the List type. You’ll implement  it as an abstract sealed class, Option, containing two internal subclasses that represent  the presence and the absence of data.  We’ll call the subclass representing the absence of data None, and the subclass rep- resenting the presence of data Some. A Some will contain the corresponding data value.  Figure 6.1 shows how the Option type might change the way functions can be com- posed, and the next listing  shows the code for the Option data type.  Listing 6.1    The Option data type  sealed class Option  {       abstract fun isEmpty  : Boolean  Option is made covariant in A.      internal object None: Option    {           override fun isEmpty   = true  None is a singleton object that  will be used for all types.          override fun toString  : String = "None"          override fun equals other: Any? : Boolean =                                         other === None   All absences of data   are considered equal.          override fun hashCode  : Int = 0     }  Instances of Some are considered equal if their values  are equal, which is what you obtain by using a data class.      internal data class Some  internal val value: A  : Option    {           override fun isEmpty   = false     }      companion object {  The invoke function  is declared with the  operator keyword.          operator fun   invoke a: A? = null : Option              = when  a  {                  null -> None                 else -> Some a              }     } }   Using the Option type     157  Without Option  toonMap.get “Mickey”   Toon  .getMail    Mail  .createMessage    Message  Null  not found in map   Null  has no mail   Null  some error happened   With Option  toonMap.get “Mickey”   Option   .getMail    Option   .createMessage    Option   Figure 6.1    Using an Option type for optional data lets you compose functions even when the data is absent.  Without the Option type, composing functions wouldn’t produce a function because the resulting program would  potentially throw a NullPointerException.  In this listing, you can see how close Option is to List. They’re both abstract classes  with two internal implementations. The None subclass corresponds to Nil and the Some  subclass to Cons. Also note that with the invoke function, using null for the default  value might be seen as a dirty trick. Feel free to overload the function with a version  taking no arguments if you prefer. You can now use Option for your definition of the  max function as shown here: fun max list: List  : Option  = Option list.max     As it is, the Option class isn’t useful. All you can do is test whether the result is empty  or to print it. You could have added a function for returning the value, but this func- tion would have to throw an exception or return null when called on None. Returning  null would defeat the whole purpose of Option. Throwing exceptions is bad because it  doesn’t compose or, at least, it doesn’t compose in the same way other results compose.  If you know Java, you know that the Optional class in Java has a get method returning  the value if present or throwing an exception otherwise.  Here’s what Brian Goetz, Java Language Architect at Oracle, says about it:3 Public service announcement: NEVER call Optional.get unless you can prove it will never  be null; instead use one of the safe methods like orElse or ifPresent. In retrospect, we should  have called get something like getOrElseThrowNoSuchElementException or something that  made it far clearer that this was a highly dangerous method that undermined the whole  purpose of Optional in the first place. Lesson learned.  Reality is much simpler: there shouldn’t be any get method in Java Optional, and you  won’t put one in the Option class either. Here’s the reason: Option is a computational  context for safely handling optional data. Optional data is potentially unsafe, which  is why you need a safe context to put it in. As a consequence, you should never take a  value out of this context without first making it safe.    3  Brian Goetz’s answer to the question “Should Java 8 getters return optional type?” on Stackoverflow  October 12, 2014 ,  https:  stackoverflow.com questions 26328555.       158  chapter 6  Dealing with optional data  6.4.1  Getting a value from an Option  Many functions that you created for List will also be useful for Option. But before you  create these functions, let’s start with some Option-specific usage. Remember the use  of a default value? exercise 6.1 Implement a getOrElse function that returns either the contained value, if it exists, or  a provided default one. Here’s how the function signature might look: fun getOrElse default: A : A  soLution This  function  is  implemented  in  the  Option  class  and  takes  a  parameter  of  type  A,  which isn’t compatible with covariance. You should deactivate variance checking by  using the @UnsafeVariance annotation as explained in chapter 5: fun getOrElse default: @UnsafeVariance A : A = when  this  {     is None -> default     is Some -> value }  You can now define functions that return options and use the returned value trans- parently as follows  using the standard Kotlin List class : val max1 = max listOf 3, 5, 7, 2, 1  .getOrElse 0  val max2 = max listOf   .getOrElse 0   Here,  max1  is  equal  to  7   the  maximum  value  in  the  list   and  max2  is  set  to  0   the  default value . But you still might have a problem. Look at the following example: fun getDefault  : Int = throw RuntimeException    fun main args: Array   {     val max1 = max listOf 3, 5, 7, 2, 1  .getOrElse getDefault        println max1      val max2 = max listOf   .getOrElse getDefault        println max2  }  This example is a bit contrived. The getDefault function isn’t a function at all. But  this is only to show you what’s happening. What will this example print? If you think  it’ll print 7 and then throw an exception, take another look at the code.  This example prints nothing and will directly throw an exception because Kotlin is  a strict language. Function parameters are evaluated before the function is executed,  whether they’re needed or not. This means the getOrElse function parameter is evalu- ated in any case, whether it’s called on a Some or a None. The fact that the function param- eter isn’t needed for a Some is irrelevant. This makes no difference when the parameter  is a literal, but it makes a huge difference when it’s a function call. The getDefault func- tion will be called in any case, so the first line will throw an exception and nothing will be  displayed. This is generally not what you want.   6.4.2  Applying functions to optional values  Using the Option type     159  exercise 6.2 Fix the previous problem, adding a new version of the getOrElse function with a lazily  evaluated parameter. hint Instead of using a literal value, use a function with no argument that returns the value. soLution Here’s the implementation for this function in the parent Option class: fun getOrElse default:    -> @UnsafeVariance A : A = when  this  {     is None -> default       is Some -> value }  In the absence of a value, the parameter is evaluated through a call to the provided  function. The max example can now be rewritten as follows: val max1 = max listOf 3, 5, 7, 2, 1  .getOrElse ::getDefault  println max1  val max2 = max listOf   .getOrElse ::getDefault  println max2   This program prints 7 to the console before throwing an exception.  One important function in List is the map function, which allows you to apply a func- tion from A to B to each element of a list of A, producing a list of B. Considering that an  Option is like a list containing at most one element, you can apply the same principle. exercise 6.3 Create a map function to change an Option  into an Option  by applying a func- tion from A to B. hint You can define an abstract function in the Option class with one implementation in  each subclass. Alternatively, you can implement the function in the Option class. In  the first case, be aware of the type in the None class. The abstract function signature in  Option will be this: abstract fun   map f:  A  -> B : Option   soLution The None implementation is simple. You need to return the None singleton. Note that  the function to map has to be of type  Nothing  -> B: override fun   map f:  Nothing  -> B : Option  = None  The Some implementation isn’t much more complex. All you need to do is to get the  value, apply the function to it, and wrap the result in a new Some: override fun   map f:  A  -> B : Option  = Some f value     160  chapter 6  Dealing with optional data  Alternatively, you may prefer to implement the function in the Option parent class: fun   map f:  A  -> B : Option  = when  this  {     is None -> None     is Some -> Some f value   }  6.4.3  Dealing with Option composition  As you’ll soon realize, functions from A to B aren’t the most common ones in safe  programs. At first, you may have trouble getting acquainted with functions return- ing optional values. After all, it seems to involve extra work to wrap values in Some  instances.  But  with  further  practice,  you’ll  see  that  these  operations  occur  only  rarely.  When chaining functions to build a complex computation, you’ll often start with a  value that’s returned by some previous computation and pass the result to a new func- tion without seeing the intermediate result. You’ll more often use functions from A to  Option  than functions from A to B. Think about the List class. Does this ring a bell?  Yes, it leads to the flatMap function. exercise 6.4 Create  a  flatMap  instance  function  taking  as  an  argument  a  function  from  A  to  Option  and returning an Option . hint You  can  define  different  implementations  in  both  subclasses,  but  you  should  try  to  devise a unique implementation that works for both subclasses and put it in the Option  class. Its signature will be fun   flatMap f:  A  -> Option  : Option   Try using some of the functions you’ve already defined  map and getOrElse . soLution The trivial solution would be to define an abstract function in the Option class, return- ing None in the None class, and returning Some f value   in the Some class. This is  probably the most efficient implementation. But a more elegant solution is to map the  f function, giving an  Option >, and then use the  getOrElse function to  extract the value  Option  , providing None as the default value: fun   flatMap f:  A  -> Option  : Option  = map f .getOrElse None   exercise 6.5 Just as you needed a way to map a function that returns an Option  leading to flat- Map , you’ll need a version of getOrElse for Options default values. Create the orElse  function with the following signature: fun orElse default:    -> Option  : Option    Using the Option type     161  Option  Option  is mostly used—through  hint As you might guess from the name, there’s no need to get the value in order to imple- ment this function. This is how composition rather than wrapping and getting values. One consequence is that the same implemen- tation works for both subclasses. Don’t forget, however, to take care of variance. soLution The solution consists in mapping the function  >, and then using The _ for  the  tained in annotation: fun orElse default:    -> Option  : Option  =  Option on this result with the provided default value. in the function is used by convention for arguments that aren’t used.

You could easily implement such a function in your Kotlin  Option class, although you’d call it isSome   because it would test whether the object  is a Some or a None. You could also call it isNone  , which might seem more logical,  because that would be the equivalent to the List.isEmpty   function.  Although the isSome   function could sometimes be useful, it isn’t the best way  to use the Option class. If you were to test an Option through an isSome   function  before calling some sort of getOrThrow   to get the value, it wouldn’t be much dif- ferent from testing a reference for null before de-referencing it. The only difference  would be if you forget to test first: you’d risk seeing an IllegalStateException or  NoSuchElementException or whatever exception you chose for the None implementa- tion of getOrThrow  , instead of a NullPointerException.  The best way to use Option is through composition. To do this, you must create all  the necessary functions for all use cases. These use cases correspond to what you’d do  with the value after testing that it’s not null. You could, for example  ¡	Use the value as the input to another function ¡	Apply an effect to the value ¡	Use the value if it’s not null or use a default value to apply a function or an effect  The first and third use cases have already been made possible through the functions  you’ve already created. Applying an effect can be done in different ways, which you’ll  learn about in chapter 12.  As an example, look at how you can use the Option class to change the way you’d  use a map. In listing 6.2, you’ll use an extension function on Map in order to return  an Option when querying for a given key. The standard Kotlin implementation of Map  .get key , which you can use as Map[key], returns null if the key isn’t found. You’ll  use the getOption extension function in order to return an Option.

You don’t have to test for anything and you don’t risk a Exception, although you might be asking for the email of a or even for a nullable type operators, is shown in the following listing.  Option  Toon  Toon  Listing 6.3       Using nullable types in a more idiomatic Kotlin style  fun main args: Array   {  val toons: Map   = mapOf   "Mickey" to Toon "Mickey", "Mouse", "mickey@disney.com" , "Minnie" to Toon "Minnie", "Mouse" , "Donald" to Toon "Donald", "Duck", "donald@disney.com"    val mickey = toons["Mickey"]?.email ?: "No data" val minnie = toons["Minnie"]?.email ?: "No data" val goofy = toons["Goofy"]?.email ?: "No data"  println mickey  println minnie  println goofy   }  }  At this stage, you may find the Kotlin style more convenient. But there’s a little prob- lem. Both programs display the following result: Some value=mickey@disney.com  None No data  The first line is Mickey‘s email. The second line says “None” because Minnie has no email. The third line says “No data” because Goofy isn’t in the map. Clearly, you need a way to distinguish these two cases, but neither using nullable types nor the class allows you to distinguish between the two. In chapter 7, you’ll see how to solve this problem.  Option                                                     164  chapter 6  Dealing with optional data  exercise 6.7 Implement the variance value function in terms of flatMap. The variance of a series  of  values  represents  how  those  values  are  distributed  around  the  mean.   This  isn’t  related to type variance.  If all values are near the mean, the variance is low. A variance  of 0 is obtained when all values are equal to the mean. The variance of a series is the  mean of Math.pow x - m, 2  for each element x in the series, where m is the mean  of the series. This function is to be implemented at the package level  outside of the  Option class . Here’s its signature: val variance:  List   -> Option   hint To implement this function, you must first create a mean function. If you have trouble  defining the mean function, refer to chapter 5 or use the following: val mean:  List   -> Option  = { list ->     when {         list.isEmpty   -> Option           else -> Option list.sum     list.size      } }  soLution Once you’ve defined the mean function, the variance function is quite simple: val variance:  List   -> Option  = { list ->     mean list .flatMap { m ->         mean list.map { x ->             Math.pow  x - m , 2.0          }      } }  Using value functions isn’t mandatory, but you must use value functions if you need  to pass them as arguments to HOFs. When you only need to apply them, however, fun  functions can be simpler to use. If you prefer to use fun functions when possible, you  might arrive at the following solution: fun mean list: List  : Option  =     when {         list.isEmpty   -> Option           else -> Option list.sum     list.size      }  fun variance list: List  : Option  =     mean list .flatMap { m ->         mean list.map { x ->             Math.pow  x - m , 2.0          }      }   Using the Option type     165  As you can see, fun functions are simpler to use because the types are simpler. For this  reason, you’ll use fun functions instead of value functions as often as possible. Further- more, it’s easy to switch from one to another. Given this function fun aToBfunction a: A : B {   return ... }  you can create an equivalent value function by writing val aToBfunction:  A  -> B = { a -> aToBfunction a  }  Or you can use a function reference: val aToBfunction:  A  -> B = ::aToBfunction  Conversely, you can create a fun function from the preceding value function: fun aToBfunction a: A : B = aToBfunction a   As the implementation of variance demonstrates, by using flatMap you can construct  a computation with multiple stages, any of which can fail. The computation aborts as  soon as the first failure is encountered because None.flatMap f  immediately returns  None without trying to apply f.  6.4.5  Other ways to combine options  Deciding  to  use  Option  can  seem  to  have  huge  consequences.  In  particular,  some  developers believe that their legacy code will be made obsolete. What can you do now  that you need a function from Option  to Option , and you only have an API with  functions for converting an A into a B? Do you need to rewrite all your libraries? Not at  all. You can easily adapt them. exercise 6.8 Define a lift function that takes a function from A to B as its argument and returns  a function from Option  to Option . As usual, use the functions you’ve already  defined. Figure 6.2 shows how the lift function works. hint Use the map function to create a fun function at the package level.  val abs0:  Option   –> Option  = lift ::abs   val abs:  Double  –> Double = { d –> if  d > 0  d else –d  }  lift transforms a function from double to double into a function from Option  to Option .  abs0 None  = None  abs0 Some d   = Some abs d    Figure 6.2       Lifting a function         166  chapter 6  Dealing with optional data  soLution The solution is pretty simple: fun   lift f:  A  -> B :  Option   -> Option  = { it.map f  }  Most of your existing libraries won’t contain value functions; they’ll contain only fun  functions. Converting a fun function that takes an A as its argument and returns a B  into a function from Option  to Option  is easy. For example, lifting the function  String.toUpperCase can be done this way: val upperOption:  Option   -> Option  =                                  lift { it.toUpperCase   }  Or you can use a function reference: val upperOption:  Option   -> Option  =                             lift String::toUpperCase   exercise 6.9 The previous lift function is useless for functions throwing exceptions. Write a ver- sion of lift that works with functions throwing exceptions. soLution For this exercise, you need to wrap the implementation of the function returned by  lift in a try… catch block, returning None if an exception is thrown: fun   lift f:  A  -> B :  Option   -> Option  = {     try {         it.map f      } catch  e: Exception  {         Option       } }  You might also need to transform the function from A to B into a function from A to  Option . You can apply the same technique: fun   hLift f:  A  -> B :  A  -> Option  = {     try {         Option it .map f      } catch  e: Exception  {         Option       } }  Note that this approach isn’t useful because the exception is lost. In chapter 7, you’ll  learn how to solve this problem.  What if you want to use a legacy function taking two arguments? Let’s say you want to  use the Java Integer.parseInt String s, int radix  method with an Option   and an Option . How can you do this? The first step is to create a value func- tion from this Java method. That’s simple: val parseWithRadix:  Int  ->  String  -> Int =         { radix -> { string -> Integer.parseInt string, radix  } }   Using the Option type     167  inverted   the  inverting   and  produces   arguments  the   here  arguments   sense I’ve  a because  all strings with a given radix. This can be useful, although not function that lets you parse inverting the arguments produces a function that lets you parse a given string with any radix.

Usually, what you’ll need for the result is a Some >  if all elements are Some , and a None if at least one element is a None . This is  only one possible result. Sometimes, you’ll want to ignore the None results and get a list  List . This is a completely different use case. exercise 6.11 Write  a  package-level  function  called  sequence  that  combines  a  List >  into an Option >. It’ll be a Some > if all values in the original list are  Some instances, or a None > if there is at least one None in the list. Here’s its  signature: fun   sequence list: List > : Option >  Note that you must now use the List you defined in chapter 5 and not the Kotlin List. hint To find your way, you can test the list to see whether it’s empty, and, if not, make a  recursive call to sequence. Then, remembering that foldRight and foldLeft abstract  recursion, you could use one of these functions to implement sequence. soLution Here’s  an  explicitly  recursive  version  that  could  be  used  if  you  had  defined  list. head   and list.tail   public functions in List  but it won’t compile because you  haven’t : fun   sequence list: List > : Option > {     return if  list.isEmpty            Option List        else         list.head  .flatMap { hh ->             sequence list.tail   .map { x -> x.cons hh  }  }  }  The functions list.head   and list.tail   shouldn’t exist because these functions  would possibly throw exceptions when called on an empty list. A solution would be to  make these functions return an Option. Fortunately, the sequence function can also be  implemented using foldRight and map2: fun   sequence list: List > : Option > =         list.foldRight Option List     { x ->             { y: Option > -> map2 x, y  { a ->                 { b: List  -> b.cons a  } }             }         }  Note that Kotlin is unfortunately not able to infer types of parameters y and b.  This is  where Kotlin isn’t as powerful as Java!  Now, consider the following example: val parseWithRadix:  Int  ->  String  -> Int = { radix ->     { string ->         Integer.parseInt string, radix      } }   Using the Option type     169  val parse16 = hLift parseWithRadix 16   val list = List "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "A", "B"  val result = sequence list.map parse16   println result   This produces the intended result but is somewhat inefficient because the map func- tion and the sequence function both invoke foldRight. exercise 6.12 Define a traverse function that produces the same result but invokes foldRight only  once. Here’s its signature: fun   traverse list: List  , f:  A  -> Option  : Option >  Then implement sequence in terms of traverse. hint Don’t use recursion explicitly. Prefer the foldRight function that abstracts recursion  for you. soLution First define the traverse function: fun   traverse list: List  , f:  A  -> Option  : Option > =         list.foldRight Option List     { x ->             { y: Option > ->                 map2 f x , y  { a ->                     { b: List  ->                         b.cons a                      }                 }             }         }  Then you can redefine the sequence function in terms of traverse: fun   sequence list: List > : Option > =                             traverse list  { x -> x }  6.4.7  Using Option and when to do so  As I said in chapter 2 and in the introduction to this chapter, Kotlin has a different way of  handling optional data. You may then wonder what technique you should use—nullable  types or Option:  ¡	Nullable types are useful for internal use in some functions, such as generators,  when returning  null indicates the terminal condition. But such nulls should  never leak outside a function; those should be for local use only, and never return  null except in local functions.  ¡	Option is fine for truly optional data. But generally, the absence of data is the  result  of  errors  that  traditional  programmers  would  handle  by  throwing  and  catching exceptions. Returning  None instead of throwing an exception is like  catching an exception and swallowing it silently. It might not be a billion dollar    170  chapter 6  Dealing with optional data  mistake, but it’s still a big one. You’ll learn in chapter 7 how to deal with this sit- uation. After that, you’ll hardly ever need the Option data type again. But don’t  worry; all you’ve learned in this chapter will still be extremely useful.  The Option type is the simplest form of a kind of data type that you’ll use again and  again. It’s a parameterized type, and it comes with a function to make an Option   from an A. The Option type also has a flatMap function that can be used to compose  Option instances. Although it isn’t useful by itself, it has introduced you to a funda- mental concept called the monad. But List also has the same characteristics. What’s  important  is  what  these  two  classes  have  in  common.  Don’t  worry  about  the  term  monad; there’s nothing to be afraid of. Look at it as a design pattern  although it’s  much more than this .  Summary  ¡	You need a way to represent optional data, which means data that may or may not  be present. The Some subtype represents data and the None subtype represents  the absence of data.  ¡	Kotlin uses nullable types to represent optional data. These protect you against  the NullPointerException when you use non-nullable types, and it forces you to  handle null when using nullable types.  ¡	The null pointer is the most impractical and dangerous way to represent the  absence of data. Sentinel values and empty lists are other possible ways to repre- sent the absence of data, but they don’t compose well.  ¡	The Option data type is a better way to represent optional data. ¡	You can apply functions to Option using the map and flatMap higher order func- tions, allowing for easy Option composition. Functions operating on values can  be lifted to operate on Option instances.  ¡	List  can  be  composed  with  Option.  A  List   can  be  turned  into  an   Option  using the sequence function.  ¡	Option instances can be compared for equality. Instances of subtype Some are  equal if their wrapped values are equal. Because there’s only one instance of  None, all instances of None are equal.  ¡	Although Option can represent the result of a computation producing an excep-  tion, all information about the occurring exception is lost.   7Handling errors   and exceptions  In this chapter ¡	Holding error information with the Either type ¡	Handling errors with the biased Result type ¡	Accessing and manipulating Result data ¡	Lifting functions to operate on Result  In chapter 6, you learned how to deal with optional data without having to manip- ulate null references using the Option data type. As you saw, this data type is per- fect for dealing with the absence of data when that isn’t the result of an error. But  it’s not an efficient way to handle errors because, although it allows you to cleanly  report the absence of data, it swallows the cause of the absence. All missing data is  treated the same way, and it’s up to the caller to try to figure out what happened.  Often, this is impossible.  In this chapter, you’ll work through a variety of exercises that teach you how to  handle errors and exceptions in Kotlin. One skill you’ll learn is how to represent  the absence of data due to an error, which the Option type doesn’t allow. We’ll first   171   172  chapter  7     Handling errors and exceptions  look at the problems that need solving, and then we’ll explore the the  Result    type:  Either     type and  type is useful for functions that can return values of two different types.   Either   type is useful when you need a type that represents either data or Result  and   exercises   using   the  Either  handling   and   applying   effects,   and   and  Result also   you’ll   types,  see   an   you’ll   look advanced  ¡  ¡  The The an error.  After  at  Result  some  advanced  discussion  Result composition.  7.1   The problems with missing data of the time, the absence of data is the result of an error, either in the input data Most or in the computation. These are two different cases, but they end with the same result: data is absent and it’s meant to be present.  In traditional programming, when a function or a method takes an object param- null. But what is often undefined. Remember the example  eter, most programmers know that they should test this parameter for they should do if the parameter is from listing 6.2 in chapter 6: val goofy = toons.getOption "Goofy" .flatMap { it.email }  null  println goofy.getOrElse { "No data" }    In this example, the output of “No data” was obtained because the Goofy the map. This could be considered a normal case. But consider this one:  key wasn’t in  val toon = getName    .flatMap toons::getOption  .flatMap Toon::email   println toon.getOrElse{"No data"}   fun getName  : Option  = ???  If the user enters an empty string, what should you do? An obvious solution would be to validate the input and return an Option . In the absence of a valid string, you could return None. You also know that such an operation could throw an excep- tion. The program would look like this:  }  }  val toon = getName    .flatMap toons::getOption  .flatMap Toon::email   println toon.getOrElse{"No data"}   fun getName  : Option  = try {  validate readLine                                                                                                                        The Either type     173  } catch  e: IOException  {  Option    }  }  fun validate name: String? : Option  = when {  name?.isNotEmpty   ?: false -> Option name  else -> Option    Now think about what could happen when this code is run:  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  IOException  is thrown, and you get No data printed to the console.    Everything goes well, and you get an email printed to the console. An The name entered by the user doesn’t validate, and you get No data. The name validates but isn’t found in the map. You get No data. The name is found in the map, but the corresponding toon has no email. You get No data.  is   to   the   you   need   printed   different   messages   Pair , Option >  hap- What  pening in each case.

This is the opposite of a  None. What you need is a  U, but not a  Pair<T,   and a  and  or a  U.  T  T  T  T  7.2   The Either type To handle the case where a function could return values of two different types, such as one representing data and one representing an error, you’ll use a special type: the to need  You  Either value. a  hold  slightly  You’ll  will  type  be called  names.  as shown in the following listing.  a  Option the  Right  can  hold  changing  two   a B to  make  the  the change  and  easy.  it  Either  or  A type  of   type.  modify   that  by  The   either  the  type  type   an None  Designing   subclasses   also  Left  private   is   Listing 7.1       The  Either  type  sealed class Either  {  internal class Left  private val value: A : Either    {     override fun toString  : String = "Left $value "  }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               174  chapter 7  Handling errors and exceptions      internal     class Right  private val value: B  : Either    {         override fun toString  : String = "Right $value "     }      companion object {         fun   left value: A : Either  = Left value          fun   right value: B : Either  = Right value      } }  Now  you  can  easily  use  Either  instead  of  Option  to  represent  values  that  could  be  absent due to errors. You need to parameterize Either with the type of your data and  the type of the error.  By convention, you’ll use the Right subclass to represent success  which is right  and  the Left subclass to represent error. But you won’t call the subclass Wrong because the  Either type can be used to hold data that’s represented by one type or another, both  being valid.  You have to choose what type will represent the error. You can choose String in  order to carry an error message, or you can prefer to use some kind of Exception. For  example, the max function returning the maximum value of the list that you defined in  chapter 6 could be modified as follows: fun  >  max list: List  : Either  = when list  {     is List.Nil  -> Either.left "max called on an empty list"      is List.Cons -> Either.right list.foldLeft list.head  { x ->  {  y ->             if  x.compareTo y  == 0  x else y         }     }  }  In order for the Either type to be useful, you need a way to compose it. The simplest  composition is with itself. The result of a function returning an Either might need  to be used as the input of another function returning another Either. To compose  functions returning Either, you need to define the same functions you defined on the  Option class. exercise 7.1 Define a map function to change an Either  into an Either , given a func- tion from A to B. The signature of the map function is as follows: abstract fun   map f:  A  -> B : Either   hint Parameter names E and A are chosen to make clear which side you should map, E stand- ing for error. But it would be possible to define two map functions  call them mapLeft  and mapRight  to map one or the other side of an Either instance. You’re developing  a biased version of Either that will be mappable on one side only.   The Either type     175  soLution The Left implementation is a bit more complex than the None implementation for  Option because you need to construct a new Either holding the same  error  value as  the original: override fun   map f:  A  -> B : Either  = Left value   The Right implementation is exactly like the one in Some: override fun   map f:  A  -> B : Either  = Right f value    exercise 7.2 Define a flatMap function to change an Either  into an Either , given a  function from A to Either . The signature of the flatMap function is as follows: abstract fun   flatMap f:  A  -> Either  : Either   soLution The Left implementation is exactly the same as for the map function: override fun   flatMap f:  A  -> Either  : Either  =                                                         Left value   The Right implementation is the same as the Option.flatMap function: override fun   flatMap f:  A  -> Either  : Either  = f value   Note that the E parameter has been made invariant. You won’t need to bother with  variance because you’ll soon get rid of this parameter. exercise 7.3 Define functions getOrElse and orElse with the following signatures: fun getOrElse defaultValue:    -> @UnsafeVariance A : A  fun orElse defaultValue:    -> Either  : Either   hint Beware of variance! soLution To deactivate variance checking, both functions should have an argument type anno- tated with @UnsafeVariance. The getOrElse function returns the contained value when  this is an instance of Right or the return value of a call to the defaultValue function  otherwise. In the Right subclass, you’ll need to change access to the value property from  private to internal to allow access from the superclass implementation of the get- OrElse function: fun getOrElse defaultValue:    -> @UnsafeVariance A : A = when  this  {     is Right -> this.value     is Left  -> defaultValue   }   176  chapter 7  Handling errors and exceptions  The orElse function will map a constant function returning this and call getOrElse  on the result: fun orElse defaultValue:    -> Either  : Either  =         map { this }.getOrElse defaultValue   The Either class works fine, but it’s far from ideal. The problem is that you don’t know  what happens if no value is available. Here, you get the default value without knowing  if it’s the result of a computation or the result of an error. To handle error cases cor- rectly, you’d need a biased version of Either, where the left type is known. Rather than  using Either  which, by the way, has many other interesting use cases , you can create  a specialized version using a known fixed type for the Left class.  The first question you might ask is, “What type should I use?” Obviously, two differ- ent types come to mind: String and RuntimeException. A string can hold an error  message, just as an exception does, but many error situations produce an exception.  Using a String as the type carried by the Left value will force you to ignore the rel- evant information in the exception and use only the included message. It’s better to  use Runtime Exception as the Left value. And if you only have a message, you’ll wrap it  into an exception.  7.3   The Result type What you need is a type representing either data or an error. As this type generally  represents the result of a computation that might have failed, you’ll call it Result. It’s  similar to the Option type, except the subclasses are named Success and Failure as  shown in the following listing. As you can see, this class is much like the Option class  with the additional stored exception.  Listing 7.2    The Result class  Constructors are internal.  import java.io.Serializable  sealed class Result : Serializable {   The Result class takes only one type parameter,  corresponding to the success value.      internal      class Failure           internal val exception: RuntimeException :                                           Result    {         override fun toString  : String = "Failure ${exception.message} "     }      internal      class Success  internal val value: A  :                                          Result    {          override fun toString  : String = "Success $value "     }      companion object {  The Failure subclass contains  a RuntimeException.   The Result type     177  If a Failure is  constructed with a  message, it’s wrapped  into a RuntimeException   more specifically, the  IllegalStateException  subclass .          operator fun   invoke a: A? = null : Result              = when  a  {                null -> Failure NullPointerException                    else -> Success a              }          fun   failure message: String : Result  =             Failure IllegalStateException message     If a Result is constructed  with a null value, you  immediately get a Failure.          fun   failure exception: RuntimeException : Result  =             Failure exception  H          fun   failure exception: Exception : Result  =             Failure IllegalStateException exception        } }  If constructed with a RuntimeException,  it’s stored as is.  If constructed with a checked exception,  it’s wrapped into a RuntimeException.    Option  flatMap,  Result, you’ll need the same functions that you defined in the classes, with minor differences.  To compose and Either exercise 7.4 Define getOrElse, you map, can define two functions: one taking a value as its argument and one taking a function producing the default value. Here are the signatures: fun   map f:  A  -> B : Result  fun   flatMap f:  A  ->  Result  : Result  fun   getOrElse defaultValue: A : A fun   orElse defaultValue:    -> Result  : Result   class.

For example, to use this class, you can modify the previous Toon- Mail illustration. First you need to create a special get extension function on Map that  returns a Result.Failure if the key is not in the map, as shown in the next listing. You  can call this new function getResult.  Listing 7.3    The new Map.getResult function returning a Result  If the key is contained in the map, return a  Success containing the retrieved object.  Otherwise, return a Failure  containing an error message.  fun   Map .getResult key: K  = when {    this.containsKey key  -> Result this[key]      else -> Result.failure "Key $key not found in map"   }  Then modify the Toon class as shown in the following listing.  Listing 7.4    The modified Toon class with the modified email property  Constructor is private.  The email property is now a Result   which is either a Success or a Failure .  data class Toon private constructor  val firstName: String,                  val lastName: String,                 val email: Result   {       companion object {         operator fun invoke firstName: String,                              lastName: String  =             Toon firstName, lastName,                   Result.failure "$firstName $lastName has no mail"    If no mail is provided, a  Result.Failure is used as  the default value.  The invoke function  is overloaded.          operator fun invoke firstName: String,                              lastName: String,                             email: String  =             Toon firstName, lastName, Result email        } }  Now modify the ToonMail program as indicated in the following listing.  If the object is constructed  with an email, it’s wrapped  in a Result.  Listing 7.5    The modified program using Result  fun main args: Array   {      val toons: Map   = mapOf          "Mickey" to Toon "Mickey", "Mouse", "mickey@disney.com" ,         "Minnie" to Toon "Minnie", "Mouse" ,         "Donald" to Toon "Donald", "Duck", "donald@disney.com"        val toon = getName           .flatMap toons::getResult           .flatMap Toon::email   Methods returning Result are  composed through flatMap.   180  chapter 7  Handling errors and exceptions      println toon   }  fun getName  : Result  = try {      validate readLine    } catch  e: IOException  {     Result.failure e  }  The getName function lets you input a  name from the keyboard, resulting in a  Failure if the name doesn’t validate or if  an exception is thrown.  fun validate name: String? : Result  = when {     name?.isNotEmpty   ?: false -> Result name      else -> Result.failure "Invalid name $name"  }  You  can  modify  the  getName  function  to  represent  an  exception  being  thrown  by  returning a Failure that wraps the exception.  Note how the various operations returning a Result are composed. You don’t need to  access the value contained in the Result, which may be an exception. The flatMap func- tion is used for such composition. Try to run this program with various input such as these: "Mickey" "Minnie" "Goofy" an empty value  just press the Enter key   Here’s what the program prints in each case: Success mickey@disney.com  Failure Minnie Mouse has no mail  Failure Key Goofy not found in map  Failure Invalid name    This result may seem good, but it isn’t. The problem is that Minnie  having no email   and Goofy  not being in the map  are reported as failures. These might be failures, but  they might alternatively be normal cases. After all, if having no email was a failure, you  wouldn’t have allowed a Toon instance to be created without one.  Obviously, this isn’t a failure but only optional data. The same is true for the map. It  might be an error if a key isn’t in the map  assuming it was supposed to be there , but  from the map’s point of view, it’s optional data. You might think this isn’t a problem  because you already have a type for this  the Option type you developed in chapter 6 .  But look at the way you’ve composed your functions: toon = getName           .flatMap toons::getResult          .flatMap Toon::email   This was only possible because getName, Map.getResult, and Toon.email all return  a Result. If Map.getResult and Toon.email were to return Option, they’d no longer  compose with getName. It’s still possible to convert a Result to and from an Option.  For example, you could add a toOption function in Result: abstract fun toOption  : Option    Result patterns     181  The Success implementation would be override fun toOption  : Option  = Option value   The Failure implementation would be override fun toOption  : Option  = Option    You could then use it as follows: Option  result =      getName  .toOption  .flatMap toons::getResult .flatMap Toon::emmail   But you’d lose all the benefit of using Result! Now if an exception is thrown inside the  getName function, it’s still wrapped in a Failure but the exception is lost in the toOp- tion function, and the program simply prints none  You might think you should go the other way and convert an Option into a Result.  This would work  although, in our example, you should call the new toResult func- tion on both Option instances returned by Map.get and Toon.getMail , but it would  be tedious. Because you’ll usually have to convert Option to Result, a much better way  would be to cast this conversion into the Result class. All you have to do is to create a  new subclass corresponding to the None case. The Some case doesn’t need conversion,  apart from changing its name for Success. The next listing shows the new Result class  with the new subclass called Empty.  Listing 7.6    The new Result class handling errors and optional data  The getOrElse and orElse functions have  been modified to handle the Empty case.  sealed class Result : Serializable {      abstract fun   map f:  A  -> B : Result       abstract fun   flatMap f:  A  ->  Result  : Result       fun getOrElse defaultValue: @UnsafeVariance A : A = when  this  {         is Result.Success -> this.value         else -> defaultValue      }      fun getOrElse defaultValue:    -> @UnsafeVariance A : A = when  this  {         is Result.Success -> this.value         else -> defaultValue        }      fun orElse defaultValue:    -> Result  : Result  =         when  this  {             is Success -> this             else -> try {                  defaultValue               } catch  e: RuntimeException  {   182  chapter 7  Handling errors and exceptions                  Result.failure  e              } catch  e: Exception  {                 Result.failure  RuntimeException e               }         }      internal object Empty: Result    {   Like the None instance in Option,  Result contains a singleton instance of  Empty, parameterized with Nothing.          override fun   map f:  Nothing  -> B : Result  = Empty          override fun   flatMap f:  Nothing  -> Result  : Result  =                                                                       Empty          override fun toString  : String = "Empty"     }      internal     class Failure  private val exception: RuntimeException :                                                             Result    {          override fun   map f:  A  -> B : Result  = Failure exception           override fun   flatMap f:  A  -> Result  : Result  =                                                         Failure exception           override fun toString  : String = "Failure ${exception.message} "     }      internal class Success  internal val value: A  : Result    {          override fun   map f:  A  -> B : Result  = try {             Success f value           } catch  e: RuntimeException  {             Failure e          } catch  e: Exception  {             Failure RuntimeException e           }          override fun   flatMap f:  A  -> Result  : Result  = try {             f value          } catch  e: RuntimeException  {             Failure e          } catch  e: Exception  {             Failure RuntimeException e           }          override fun toString  : String = "Success $value "     }      companion object {          operator fun   invoke a: A? = null : Result  = when  a  {             null -> Failure NullPointerException                else -> Success a          }   Result patterns     183          operator fun   invoke  : Result  = Empty           fun   failure message: String : Result  =                         Failure IllegalStateException message            fun   failure exception: RuntimeException : Result  =                         Failure exception           fun   failure exception: Exception : Result  =                         Failure IllegalStateException exception       } }  Like Option, the invoke  function that takes no  parameter returns the  Empty singleton.  Now you can again modify your ToonMail application as shown in listings 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9.  Listing 7.7    The getResult function  fun   Map .getResult key: K  = when {     this.containsKey key  -> Result this[key]      else -> Result.Empty  }  The get function now returns Result. Empty if the key isn’t found in the map.  If you construct the instance  without an email, the property  is set to Result.Empty.  Listing 7.8    The Toon class using Result.Empty for optional data  data class Toon private constructor  val firstName: String,                 val lastName: String,                 val email: Result   {      companion object {         operator fun invoke firstName: String,                             lastName: String  =             Toon firstName, lastName, Result.Empty            operator fun invoke firstName: String,                             lastName: String,                             email: String  =             Toon firstName, lastName, Result email       } }  Listing 7.9    The ToonMail application handling optional data correctly  fun main args: Array   {      val toons: Map   = mapOf          "Mickey" to Toon "Mickey", "Mouse", "mickey@disney.com" ,         "Minnie" to Toon "Minnie", "Mouse" ,         "Donald" to Toon "Donald", "Duck", "donald@disney.com"        val toon = getName           .flatMap toons::getResult          .flatMap Toon::email    184  chapter 7  Handling errors and exceptions      println toon   }  fun getName  : Result  = try {     validate readLine    } catch  e: IOException  {     Result.failure e  }  The validate function is modified  to simulate an IOException when  no name is input.  fun validate name: String? : Result  = when {     name?.isNotEmpty   ?: false -> Result name      else -> Result.failure IOException     }  Your  program  now  prints  the  following  results  when  you  enter  “Mickey”,  “Minnie”,  “Goofy”, and an empty string: Success mickey@disney.com  Empty Empty Failure java.io.IOException   You may think that something is missing because you can’t distinguish between the two  different empty cases, but this isn’t the case. Error messages aren’t needed for optional  data. If you think you need a message, the data isn’t optional.  Advanced Result handling So far you’ve seen a limited use of Result. You should never use Result to directly  access the wrapped value  if it exists . The way you used Result in the previous exam- ple  corresponds  to  the  simpler  specific  composition  use  case:  get  the  result  of  one  computation and use it for the input of the next computation.  More specific use cases exist. You could use the value in Result only if it matches  some predicate  which means some condition . You could also use the failure case, for  which you’d need to map the failure to something else or to transform the failure into a  success of exception. You might also need to use several results as the input for a single  computation. You’d probably benefit from some helper functions that create Result  from computations in order to deal with legacy code. Finally, you’ll sometimes need to  apply effects to results.  7.5   7.5.1  Applying predicates  You’ll often have to apply a predicate to a Result.  A predicate is a function returning  a Boolean.  This is something that can easily be abstracted, so that you’ll write it only  once. exercise 7.5 Write a function filter taking a condition that’s represented by a function from A to  Boolean and returning a Result , which will be Success or Failure, depending on  whether the condition holds for the wrapped value. The signature will be this: fun filter p:  A  -> Boolean : Result    Advanced Result handling     185  as a  case.  String  Failure  Create a second function taking a condition as its first argument and a second argument, using the string argument for the potential hint class and to imple- Although it’s possible to define abstract functions in the ment them in subclasses, try not to do so.

Here’s  hint Once again, try not to define an implementation in each subclass. Instead, create a sin- gle implementation in the parent class using the functions you have at your disposal. soLution The solution is to then to use function to lazily produce the default value because it’s a literal: fun exists p:  A  -> Boolean : Boolean = map p .getOrElse false   Result , and as the default value. You don’t need to use a constant  the function to the map   with getOrElse  Result , giving a  false  exists  Using function that could be applied to a list, returning the condition. It therefore makes sense to use the same name.  as the name of this function may seem questionable. But it’s the same if at least one element satisfies  true  Some might argue that this implementation would also work for a  function if all elements in the list fulfill the condition. It’s up to you to either class with the same  that returns choose another name or define a  function in the    forAll  forAll  Result  true                                                                                                                                      186  chapter 7  Handling errors and exceptions  implementation. The important point is understanding what makes List and Result  similar and what makes them different.  7.6  Mapping failures  It’s sometimes useful to change a Failure into a different one. This is like catching  an exception and rethrowing something different. The reason could be to replace an  error message with a more appropriate one, adding some information that allows the  user to determine the cause of the problem. For example, a message such as “Configu- ration file could not be found” would be much more useful if it included the path that  was searched. exercise 7.7 Define a mapFailure function that takes a String as its argument and transforms a  Failure into another Failure, using the string as its error message. If the Result is  Empty or Success, this function should do nothing. hint Define an abstract function in the parent class. soLution Here’s the abstract function in the parent class: abstract fun mapFailure message: String : Result   The Empty and Success implementations return this. Here’s the implementation in  Empty: override fun mapFailure message: String : Result  = this  And here’s the implementation in Success: override fun mapFailure message: String : Result  = this  The Failure implementation wraps the existing exception into a new one created with  the given message and returns a new Failure: override fun mapFailure message: String : Result  =             Failure RuntimeException message, exception    You can choose RuntimeException as the exception type or a more specific custom  subtype of a runtime exception. Another useful function would be one that maps an  Empty to a Failure, given a String message.  7.7   Adding factory functions You’ve seen how you can create Success and Failure from a value. Some other use cases  are so frequent that they deserve to be abstracted into supplemental factory functions.  To adapt legacy libraries, you’ll probably often create Result from a value that could pos- sibly be null, and you’d want to provide a specific error message for that case. To do this,  you could use a function in the companion object with the following signature: operator fun   invoke a: A? = null, message: String : Result    Applying effects     187  A function creating a Result from a function from A to Boolean and an instance of A  might also be useful: operator fun   invoke a: A? = null, p:  A  -> Boolean : Result  operator fun   invoke a: A? =                 null, message: String, p:  A  -> Boolean : Result   exercise 7.8 Implement the previous invoke functions. hint You have to make a choice about what to return in each case. soLution This exercise presents no difficulties. Here’s some possible implementations based on  the choice to return Empty when no error message is used and a Failure otherwise: operator fun   invoke a: A? = null, message: String : Result  =     when  a  {         null -> Failure NullPointerException message           else -> Success a      }  operator fun   invoke a: A? = null, p:  A  -> Boolean : Result  =     when  a  {         null -> Failure NullPointerException            else -> when {             p a  -> Success a              else -> Empty         }     }  operator fun   invoke a: A? = null,                         message: String,                         p:  A  -> Boolean : Result  =     when  a  {         null -> Failure NullPointerException            else -> when {             p a  -> Success a              else -> Failure IllegalArgumentException                  "Argument $a does not match condition: $message"           }     }  Notice that you don’t need to cast argument a to type A  instead of A?  before applying  the predicate. Kotlin knows that it can’t be null from the previous check in the first  when clause.  7.8   Applying effects So  far  you  haven’t  applied  any  effects  to  values  wrapped  in  Result,  other  than  by  getting  this  value   through  getOrElse .  This  isn’t  satisfying  because  it  destroys  the  advantage of using Result. On the other hand, you haven’t yet learned the necessary    188  chapter 7  Handling errors and exceptions  techniques to apply effects in a safe way. Effects can be anything that modifies some- thing in the outside world, such as writing to the console, to a file, to a database, or to a  field in a mutable component, or sending a message locally or over a network.  IMPORTANT    The technique I’ll show you now isn’t safe, so it should only be  used once all computation is carried out. Effects should be applied in a spe- cifically delimited part of your code, and no further computation should be  performed on the values once you apply effects. If you need to apply effects in a  safe way and then continue some computation, you’ll have to wait until chapter  12 to learn the necessary techniques.  Applying an effect in standard programming would consist of extracting the value  if  present  from the Result and performing some action with it. For safer programming,  you do it the other way round: you pass the effect to the Result to have it applied to the  contained value  if present .  To represent an effect in Kotlin, you use a function that doesn’t return anything and  performs the intended effect. This shouldn’t be called a function, but that’s the way it  is in Kotlin. In Java, this would be called a Consumer. The return type of such a function  in Kotlin is Unit. exercise 7.9 Define a forEach function that takes an effect as its parameter and applies it to the  wrapped value. hint Define  an  abstract  function  in  the  Result  class  with  an  implementation  in  each  subclass. soLution Here’s the abstract function declaration in Result: abstract fun forEach effect:  A  -> Unit   Note that both forEach and the effect parameter return Unit. But for a fun func- tion returning Unit, you can omit the return type. The Failure implementations do  nothing: override fun forEach effect:  A  -> Unit  {}  The Empty implementation is similar, but with a slightly different signature: override fun forEach effect:  Nothing  -> Unit  {}  The Success implementation is straightforward. You need to apply the effect to the  value: override fun forEach effect:  A  -> Unit  {     effect value  }   Applying effects     189     class you created in chapter 6. a  actions   special   take   on   to   want   for  case   Result.     not   Option you   forEach that’s   function would be perfect for the Generally,  the   This But  failure. exercise Define the the Failure abstract fun forEachOrElse onSuccess:  A  -> Unit,  forEachOrElse and the Empty  7.10    function to handle this use case. It’ll have to handle both cases. Here’s its signature in the  Result  class:  onFailure:  RuntimeException  -> Unit, onEmpty:    -> Unit   soLution All three implementations execute the corresponding function:    Success override fun forEachOrElse onSuccess:  A  -> Unit,  onFailure:  RuntimeException  -> Unit, onEmpty:    -> Unit  = onSuccess value      Failure override fun forEachOrElse onSuccess:  A  -> Unit,  onFailure:  RuntimeException  -> Unit, onEmpty:    -> Unit  = onFailure exception      Empty override fun forEachOrElse onSuccess:  Nothing  -> Unit,  onFailure:  RuntimeException  -> Unit, onEmpty:    -> Unit  = onEmpty    7.11  function  { throw it }  forEachOrElse  forEachOrElse  works fine, but it’s not optimal.

The  map2  A common use case for such functions is to call functions or constructors with argu- ments of type exam- Result ple. To populate the map, you could construct toons by asking the user to input the first name, last name, and mail on the console, using the following functions: fun getFirstName  : Result  = Result "Mickey"   returned by other functions. Take the previous Toon  ToonMail  fun getLastName  : Result  = Result "Mouse"   fun getMail  : Result  = Result "mickey@disney.com"   The real implementation will be different, but you still have to learn how to safely get input from the console. For now, you’ll use these mock implementations. Using these implementations, you could create a  as follows:  Toon                                                                       192  chapter  7     Handling errors and exceptions  var createPerson:  String  ->  String  ->  String  -> Toon =  { x -> { y -> { z -> Toon x, y, z  } } }  val toon = lift3 createPerson  getFirstName    getLastName    getMail     But you’re reaching the limits of abstraction. You might have to call functions or con- structors with more than three arguments. In such a case, you could use the following pattern, which is sometimes val toon = getFirstName    comprehension:  called  .flatMap { firstName ->  getLastName    .flatMap { lastName ->  getMail    }  }  The comprehension pattern has two advantages:  ¡  ¡  You can use any number of arguments. You don’t need to define a function.  .map { mail -> Toon firstName, lastName, mail  }  Note that you could use to specify the types because of the limited type inference capacity of Kotlin: val toon2 = lift3 { x: String ->  without defining the function separately, but you’d have  lift3  { y: String ->  { z: String ->  Toon x, y, z   }  }  } getFirstName    getLastName    getMail     Some languages have syntactic sugar for such constructs, roughly equivalent to this: for {  firstName in getFirstName  , lastName in getLastName  , mail in getMail    } return new Toon firstName, lastName, mail   or    map  Result  flatMap  flatMap  instance ,  Kotlin doesn’t have this kind of syntactic sugar, but it’s easy to do without it. Notice that are nested. Start with a call to the first function  or start the calls to from a each new call, and end by mapping the call to the constructor or function you intend to use. For example, to call a function taking five parameters when you only have five val result1 = Result 1  val result2 = Result 2  val result3 = Result 3  val result4 = Result 4  val result5 = Result 5   instances, use the following approach:  Result  fun compute p1: Int, p2: Int, p3: Int, p4: Int, p5: Int  =  p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5                                                        193  val result = result1.flatMap { p1: Int ->  result2.flatMap { p2 ->  result3.flatMap { p3 ->  result4.flatMap { p4 -> result5.map { p5 ->  compute p1, p2, p3, p4, p5   }  }  }  }  }  it shows   instead of  you how the pattern can be   This example is a bit contrived, but  extended. Note that it isn’t inherent to the pattern that the last call  the most deeply nested  is to flatMap. That’s only because the last function  compute  returns a raw map value. If it returned a val result1 = Result 1  val result2 = Result 2  val result3 = Result 3  val result4 = Result 4  val result5 = Result 5   Result, you’d have to use  instead of  flatMap  map:  fun compute p1: Int, p2: Int, p3: Int, p4: Int, p5: Int  =  Result p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5   val result = result1.flatMap { p1: Int ->  result2.flatMap { p2 ->  result3.flatMap { p3 ->  result4.flatMap { p4 ->  result5.flatMap { p5 ->  compute p1, p2, p3, p4, p5   }  }  }  }  }  Summary  But as this last function is often a constructor, and constructors always return raw val- ues, you’ll often find yourself using  as the last function call.  map  ¡  ¡  ¡  of   an   the   due   data   absence   necessary.   error    Result  the is  type.

At  that  point, you didn’t have all the techniques needed to make this structure a complete  tool for data handling. One particularly useful tool you were missing was some way  to represent operations producing optional data or operations producing an error. In chapters 6 and 7, you learned how to represent optional data and errors. In  this chapter, you’ll learn how to compose operations that produce optional data or  errors with lists. You also developed some functions that were far from optimal, such  as length, and I said that you’d eventually learn more efficient techniques for these  operations. In this chapter, you’re going to learn how to implement these more effi- cient techniques. You’ll also learn how to automatically parallelize some list opera- tions in order to benefit from the multicore architecture of today’s computers.  195   196  8.1   chapter  8     Advanced list handling  a   list   with   involves   The problem with length Folding each starting  element of the list. This obviously takes an amount of time proportional to the length of the list. Is there any way to make this operation faster? Or, at least, is there a way to make it appear faster? As an example of a fold application, you created a func-   tion in fun length  : Int = foldLeft 0  { { _ -> it + 1} }  in chapter 5  exercise 5.10  with the following implementation:  successively   composing   length  value   with   and   List  it   a   In this implementation, the list is folded using an operation that consists of adding 1 to the result for each element of the list. The starting value is 0, and the value of each ele- ment is ignored. This is what allows you to use the same definition for all lists. Because the list elements are ignored, the list element’s type is irrelevant. You can, however, compare the preceding operation with one that computes the sum of a list of integers: fun sum list: List  : Int = list.foldRight 0  { x -> { y -> x + y } }  sum    length  function works for any type. Notice that  The main difference here is that the function can only work with integers, whereas the are only ways to abstract recursion. The length of a list can be defined as 0 for an empty list and 1 plus the length of the tail for a non-empty list. In the same way, the sum of a list of integers can be defined recursively as 0 for an empty list and the head value plus the sum of the tail for a non-empty one.  foldRight  foldLeft  and  There are other operations that can be applied to lists in this way and, among them,  several for which the type of the list elements is irrelevant:  ¡  ¡  The hash code of a list can be computed by adding the hash codes of its elements.

Imagine you have a list of about one million elements and you want to check the length. Counting the elements may seem the only way to go  this is what the fold-   based function does . But if you were adding elements to the list until it reaches length one million, you surely wouldn’t count the elements after adding each one.                                                                                                                                             8.3   8.3.1   The benefits of memoization     197  In such a situation, you’d keep a count of the elements somewhere and add one to this count each time you added an element to the list. Maybe you’d have to count once if you were starting with a non-empty list, but that’s it. You learned this technique, memoization, in chapter 4. The question is, where can you store the memoized value? The answer is obvious: in the list itself.  The benefits of memoization a count of the elements in the list will take some time, so adding an ele- Maintaining ment to a list will be slightly slower than if you didn’t keep the count. It might look like you’re trading time against time. If you build a list of one million elements, you’ll lose one million times the amount of time needed to add one to the count. In com- pensation, however, the time needed to get the length of the list will be near 0  and obviously constant . Maybe the total time lost in incrementing the count will equal the gain when calling more than once, the gain is absolutely obvious.  length.

This is a huge benefit, although it has a time cost because it makes the insertion of elements slightly longer. But slow- ing insertion is generally not a big problem. A much more important problem is the increase in memory space.

But with an immutable list, you need to memoize the length in each element. It’s difficult to know the exact increase in size, but if the size of a sin- gly linked list is around 40 bytes per node  for the nodes themselves  plus two 32-bit references for the head and the tail  on a 32-bit JVM , this would result in about 100 bytes per element. In this case, adding the length would cause an increase of slightly over 30%. The result would be the same if the memoized values were references, such as memoizing the maximum or minimum of a list of objects. On a 64-bit JVM, it’s even more difficult to calculate due to some optimization in the size of the ref- erences, but you get the idea.

On the other hand, the  toString function creates new strings  that would have to be memoized, so that would probably be a huge waste of memory  space. The other factor to take into consideration is how often the function is used.  The length function can be used more often than hashCode because using lists as map  keys is not a common practice. exercise 8.1 Create a memoized version of the length function from exercise 3.8. Its signature in  the List class is abstract fun lengthMemoized  : Int  soLution The implementation in the Nil class returns 0: override fun lengthMemoized  : Int = 0  To implement the Cons version, you must first add the memoizing field to the class: internal class Cons  internal val head: A,                            internal val tail: List  : List    {      private val length: Int = tail.lengthMemoized   + 1      ...  Then you can implement the lengthMemoized function to return the length: override fun lengthMemoized   = length  This version will be much faster than the original one. One interesting thing to note  is the relationship between the length and isEmpty functions. You might be tempted  to think that  isEmpty is equivalent to  length  ==  0, but although this is true from  the logical point of view, there can be a huge difference in implementation and in  performance.  By the way, Kotlin allows for a much more compact solution by using an abstract  property. Kotlin automatically generates getters for val properties and allows you to  define abstract properties that are implemented in the extending class. The declara- tion in the List class is abstract val length: Int  In the Nil object, the property is set to 0: override val length = 0  And  in  the  Cons  class,  it’s  initialized  exactly  like  in  the  previous  function  implementation: override val length = tail.length + 1  Memoizing the maximum or minimum value in a list of Comparable could be done the  same way, but it wouldn’t help in the case where you want to remove the max or min value    List and Result composition     199  from the list. Minimum or maximum elements are often accessed to retrieve elements by  priority. In that case, the elements' compareTo function would compare their priorities.  Memoizing priority will let you know immediately which element has the maximum  priority, but it wouldn’t help much because what you often need is to remove the cor- responding element. For such use cases, you’ll need a different data structure, which  you’ll learn to create in chapter 11.  8.3.2  Evaluating performance improvements  As I said, it’s up to you to decide if you should memoize some functions of the List  class. A few experiments should help you make your decision. Measuring the available  memory size before and after the creation of a list of one million integers shows a small  increase when using memoization.  Although this measurement technique isn’t accurate, the average decrease in avail- able memory is about 22 MB in both cases  with or without memoization , varying  between 20 MB and 25 MB. This shows that the theoretical increase of 4 MB  one mil- lion * 4 bytes  isn’t as significant as you’d expect. On the other hand, the increase in  performance is huge. Asking for the length ten times might cost more than 200 ms with- out memoization. With memoization, the time is 0  too short a time to be measured in  milliseconds . Although adding an element increases the cost  adding one to the tail  length and storing the result , removing an element has no cost because the tail length  is already memoized.  8.4   List and Result composition In chapter 7, you saw that Result and List are similar data structures, mainly differ- ing in their cardinality but sharing some of their most important functions, such as  map and flatMap. You also saw how lists could be composed with lists, and results with  results. Now, you’re going to see how results can be composed with lists.  8.4.1  Handling lists returning Result  At this point, you’ll probably have noticed that I try to avoid accessing the elements  of results and lists directly. Accessing the head or the tail of a list throws an exception  if the list is Nil, and throwing an exception is one of the most direct ways to make  programs unsafe. But you learned that you could safely access the value in a Result by  providing a default value to be used in the case of a failure or empty result. Can you do  the same when accessing the head of a list? Not exactly, but you can return a Result. exercise 8.2 Implement a headSafe function in List  that will return a Result . hint Use  the  following  abstract  function  declaration  in  List  and  implement  it  in  each  subclass: abstract fun headSafe  : Result    200  chapter 8  Advanced list handling  soLution The implementation of the Nil class returns an empty Result: override fun headSafe  : Result  = Result    The Cons implementation returns a Success holding the head value: override fun headSafe  : Result  = Result head   exercise 8.3 Create a lastSafe function returning a Result of the last element in the list. hint Don’t use explicit recursion, but try to build on the functions you developed in chapter 5.  You should be able to define a single function in the List class. soLution You could solve this in several ways. I’ll show a trivial solution first and then discuss  its problems. Then I’ll show a better solution that avoids those problems. Here’s the  trivial solution using explicit recursion: fun lastSafe  : Result  = when  this  {     Nil -> Result       is Cons -> when  tail  {         Nil -> Result head          is Cons -> tail.lastSafe       } }  This solution has several problems. First, it’s recursive, so you should transform it to  make it corecursive. This is easy, but you’ll have to make it a function taking the list as  its argument: tailrec fun   lastSafe list: List  : Result  = when  list  {     List.Nil  -> Result       is List.Cons  -> when  list.tail  {         List.Nil  -> Result list.head          is List.Cons -> lastSafe list.tail      } }  A better solution is to use a fold, which abstracts recursion for you. All you need to do  is to create the right function for folding. You need to always keep the last value if it  exists. This might be the function to use: { _: Result  -> { y: A -> Result y  } }  Then you need to foldLeft the list using Result   as the identity: fun lastSafe  : Result  =     foldLeft Result    { _: Result  -> { y: A -> Result y  } }   List and Result composition     201  8.4  headSafe  exercise function with a single implementation using a fold in Can you replace the the class? What would be the benefits and drawbacks of such an implementation?   List soLution It’s possible to create such an implementation: fun headSafe  : Result  =  foldRight Result    { x: A -> { _: Result  -> Result x  } }  The only benefit is that it’s more fun if you like it that way. When devising the   lastSafe implementation, you knew you had to traverse the list in order to find the last element. To find the first element, you don’t need to traverse the list.  Using  foldRight  here is exactly the same as reversing the list and then traversing the result to find the last element  which is the first element of the original list . Not very efficient! And by the way, this is exactly what the function does to find the last element: reverses the list and takes the first element of the result. Except for the fun, there’s no reason to use this implementation. But if you prefer a single implementation in the fun headSafe  : Result  = when  this  {  class, you can use pattern matching:    lastSafe  List  Nil -> Result   is Cons -> Result head   mapping   example,   a list contains the results of some computations, it’ll often be a of  Converting from List  to Result  List .

This may or may not  be what you need.  To stick with the idea that Empty means optional data, you’d need to first filter the  list to remove the Empty elements.

You’ll regularly find yourself discover- ing new use cases that can be implemented by combining basic functions. You should  never hesitate to incorporate these use cases as new functions in the List class. The  following exercises show several of the most common use cases:  ¡	Zipping and unzipping lists ¡	Transforming a list of pairs into a pair of lists ¡	Transforming a list of any type into a pair of lists   204  8.5.1   chapter  8     Advanced list handling     Unzipping  is the process of assembling two lists into one by combining the elements hav- is the reverse procedure, consisting of making two lists coor-  Zipping and unzipping lists Zipping ing the same index. out of one by deconstructing the elements, such as producing two lists of dinates from one list of points. exercise Write a produce a new list, given a function argument.

If one of the two argument lists is empty, corecursion is stopped and the current accumulator is returned. Otherwise, a new value is computed by applying the function to the head values of both lists, and the helper function is called recursively with the tails of both argument lists. exercise The previous exercise consisted in creating a list by matching elements of both lists by their indexes. Write a function that produces a list of all possible combina- and tions of elements taken from both lists. Given the two lists  list "a","b",   product  "c"   8.9                                                                                                                                      Common List abstractions     205  list "d", "e", "f" , and string concatenation, the product of the two lists should be List "ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf" . hint For this exercise, you don’t need to use explicit recursion. soLution The solution is similar to the comprehension pattern you used to compose in chapter 7. The only difference here is that it produces as many combinations as the product of the number of elements in the lists, although for combining Result, the number of combinations was always limited to one: fun   product list1: List , list2: List , f:  A  ->  B  -> C : List  =  Result  list1.flatMap { a -> list2.map { b -> f a  b  } }       It’s possible to compose more than two lists this way. The only problem is  NOTE that the number of combinations will grow exponentially.  One of the common use cases for combination function. Here’s an example using the product List 1, 2 , List 4, 5, 6   { x -> { y: Int -> Pair x, y  } } zipWith List 1, 2 , List 4, 5, 6   { x -> { y: Int -> Pair x, y  } }  zipWith Pair  is to use a constructor for the constructor:  product  and  The first expression produces a list of all possible pairs constructed from the elements of both lists: [ 1, 4 ,  1, 5 ,  1, 6 ,  2, 4 ,  2, 5 ,  2, 6 , NIL]  only   produces   the   list   of   pairs   built   from   elements   with   the  expression   The  second  same indexes: [ 1, 4 ,  2, 5 , NIL]  8.10 unzip  exercise Write  an signature: fun   unzip list: List > : Pair , List >  transform   function   pairs   into   pair   list   of   to   of   a   a   lists.

For example, given a list of Payment instances, you should be able to produce a pair of  lists: one containing the credit cards used to make the payments and the other containing  payment amounts. Implement this function as an instance function in List with the fol- lowing signature: fun   unzip f:  A  -> Pair  : Pair , List >  hint The solution is pretty much the same as for exercise 8.10. soLution One important thing is that the result of the function is to be used twice. In order not  to apply the function twice, you can use a multiline lambda: fun   unzip f:  A  -> Pair  : Pair , List > =     this.coFoldRight Pair Nil, Nil   { a ->         { listPair: Pair , List > ->             val pair = f a              Pair listPair.first.cons pair.first ,                  listPair.second.cons pair.second           }     }  A smarter solution is to use the let function from the Kotlin standard library: fun   unzip f:  A  -> Pair  : Pair , List > =     this.coFoldRight Pair Nil, Nil   { a ->         { listPair: Pair , List > ->             f a .let {                 Pair listPair.first.cons it.first ,                      listPair.second.cons it.second               }         }     }  You may wonder why this solution is smarter. There’s absolutely no reason except that  I like it more. If you don’t, feel free to use the multiline version  which, by the way,  should be unnoticeably faster . In any case, you can now redefine the version from  exercise 8.10 as fun   unzip list: List > : Pair , List > =                                                    list.unzip { it }  8.5.2  Accessing elements by their index  In chapter 5, you worked with your first data structure, the singly linked list. The singly  linked list isn’t the best structure for indexed access to its elements, but sometimes it’s  necessary to use indexed access. As usual, you should abstract such a process into List  functions.   Common List abstractions     207  exercise 8.12 Write a getAt function that takes an index as its argument and returns the correspond- ing element. The function shouldn’t throw an exception in the case of the index being  out of bounds. hint This time, start with an explicitly recursive version. Then try to answer the following  questions:  ¡	Is it possible to do it with a fold? Right or left? ¡	Why is the explicit recursive version better? ¡	Can you think of a better implementation?  Reminder: you first encountered tail recursion in chapter 4, and chapters 3 and 5 went  into folding in depth. soLution The explicitly recursive solution is easy: fun getAt index: Int : Result  {     tailrec fun   getAt list: List , index: Int : Result  =         when  list  {             Nil -> Result.failure "Dead code. Should never execute."              is Cons ->                 if  index == 0                      Result list.head                  else                     getAt list.tail, index - 1          }     return if  index  = length            Result.failure "Index out of bound"      else         getAt this, index  }  First, you can check the index to see if it’s positive and less than the list length. If it  isn’t, return a Failure. Otherwise, call the helper function to process the list corecur- sively. This function checks whether the index is 0. If it is, it returns the head of the list  it received. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively on the tail of the list with a decremented  index.  The Nil case in the helper function is dead code. If the list is Nil, index will always  be either smaller than 0 or greater than or equal to the list length  because it’s 0 .  Consequently, the tail of the argument will never be Nil. You might prefer the follow- ing version: fun getAt index: Int : Result  {     tailrec fun   getAt list: Cons , index: Int : Result  =         if  index == 0              Result list.head          else             getAt list.tail as Cons, index - 1    You could also be tempted to use the fun getAt index: Int : Result  {  let  function of the standard library:    tailrec fun   getAt list: List , index: Int : Result  =    Warning  208  chapter  8     Advanced list handling  return if  index  = length     Result.failure "Index out of bound"   else  getAt this as Cons, index   }  }   list as Cons .let {  if  index == 0   Result list.head   else  }  getAt list.tail, index - 1   return if  index  = length     Result.failure "Index out of bound"   else  getAt this, index   this   version   But  tail-recursive.

As this value must hold both the result and the index, it’ll be a case. Then you can check the index for validity. If it’s found invalid, make the temporary result equal to  the identity .

This solution might seem smarter, but it has two drawbacks:  Success  Failure  it  ¡  ¡  You might find it less legible. This is subjective, so it’s up to you to decide. It’s less efficient because it’ll continue folding the whole list even after it finds the searched-for value.                                                                                                   Common List abstractions     209  exercise 8.13  hard  Find a solution that makes the fold-based version terminate as soon as the result is  found. hint You’ll need a special version of foldLeft for this, as well as a special version of Pair. soLution First, you need a special version of foldLeft in which you can escape the fold when the  absorbing element  or zero element  of the folding operation is found. Think of a list  of integers that you want to fold by multiplying them. The absorbing element for the  multiplication is 0, meaning that multiplying any number by 0 results in 0. Here’s the  declaration of a short-circuiting  or escaping  version of foldLeft in the List class: abstract fun   foldLeft identity: B, zero: B, f:  B  ->  A  -> B : B  The zero element By  analogy,  the  absorbing  element  of  any  operation  is  sometimes  called  zero,  but  remember that it isn’t always equal to 0.

The helper function is similar to the getAt function with  the difference that the list is first reversed. The function accumulates the elements  until the index position is reached, so the accumulated list is in the correct order, but  the remaining list has to be reversed back. exercise 8.15  not so hard if you’ve done exercise 8.13  Can you think of an implementation using a fold instead of explicit recursion? hint An implementation traversing the whole list is easy. An implementation traversing the  list only until the index is found is much more difficult. It’ll need a new special version  of foldLeft with escape, returning both the escaped value and the rest of the list. soLution A solution traversing the whole list could be as follows: fun splitAt index: Int : Pair , List > {     val ii = if  index < 0  0              else if  index >= length    length   else index     val identity = Triple Nil, Nil, ii      val rt = foldLeft identity  { ta: Triple , List , Int> ->         { a: A ->             if  ta.third == 0                  Triple ta.first, ta.second.cons a , ta.third              else                 Triple ta.first.cons a , ta.second, ta.third - 1          }     }     return Pair rt.first.reverse  , rt.second.reverse    }  The result of the fold is accumulated in the first list accumulator until the index is  reached  after the index value has been adjusted to avoid an index out of bounds con- dition. Once the index is found, the list traversal continues, but the remaining values  are accumulated in the second list accumulator.  One problem with this implementation is that by accumulating the remaining values  in the second list accumulator, you’re reversing this part of the list. Not only should you  not need to traverse the remainder of the list, but it’s done twice here: once for accumu- lating in reverse order and once for eventually reversing the result.   Common List abstractions     213  To avoid this problem, modify the special escaping version of  returns not only the escaped result  the absorbing, or zero of the list, untouched. To achieve this, you must change the signature to return a abstract fun   foldLeft identity: B, zero: B,  foldLeft  so that it element , but also the rest Pair:  f:  B  ->  A  -> B : Pair >  Then you need to change the implementation in the override fun   foldLeft identity: B, zero: B, f:  B  ->  Nothing  -> B :  class:  Nil  Pair > = Pair identity, Nil   Finally, you must change the override fun   foldLeft identity: B, zero: B, f:  B  ->  A  -> B :  implementation to return the remainder of the list:  Cons  fun   foldLeft acc: B, zero: B, list: List , f:  B  ->  A  -> B :  Pair > {  Pair > =  when  list  {  Nil -> Pair acc, list  is Cons -> if  acc == zero   Pair acc, list   else  foldLeft f acc  list.head , zero, list.tail, f   return foldLeft identity, zero, this, f   }  Now you can rewrite the fun splitAt index: Int : Pair , List > {    function using this special  splitAt  foldLeft    function:  data class Pair  val first: List , val second: Int  {  override fun equals other: Any? : Boolean = when {  other == null -> false other.javaClass == this.javaClass ->   other as Pair  .second == second  else -> false  override fun hashCode  : Int =  first.hashCode   + second.hashCode    }  return when {  index   Pair Nil, this  index >= length -> Pair this, Nil  else -> {  val identity = Pair Nil as List , -1  val zero = Pair this, index  val  pair, list  = this.foldLeft identity, zero  { acc ->  { e -> Pair acc.first.cons e , acc.second + 1  }  } Pair pair.first.reverse  , list   }  }  }  }  }                             214  chapter 8  Advanced list handling  Here again, you need a specific Pair class with a special equals function that returns  true when the second elements are equal, not taking into account the first element.  Note that the second resulting list doesn’t need to be reversed.  When not to use folds Because it’s possible to use a fold doesn’t mean you should do so. The preceding exer- cises are just that: exercises. As a library designer, you need to choose the most efficient  implementation. A good library should have a functional interface and should respect the requirements  for safe programming. This means all functions should be true functions with no side  effects and all should respect referential transparency. What happens inside the library  is irrelevant. A functional library in an imperative-oriented environment, like the JVM, can be com- pared to a compiler for a functional-oriented language. The compiled code will always  be based on mutating memory areas and registers because this is what the computer  understands. A functional library gives more choices. Some functions can be implemented in a func- tional style and others in an imperative style; it doesn’t matter. Splitting a singly linked  list or finding an element by its index is much easier and faster when it’s implemented  imperatively rather than functionally. That’s because the singly linked list isn’t adapted  for such an operation. The most functional way to go is probably not to implement functions based on indexes  based on folds, but to avoid implementing these functions at all. If you do need struc- tures with these functions, the best thing to do is to create specific structures, as you’ll  see in chapter 10.     8.5.4  Searching for sublists  One common use case for lists is finding out whether a list is contained in another   longer  list. You want to know whether a list is a sublist of another list. exercise 8.16 Implement a hasSubList function to check whether a list is a sublist of another. For  example, the list  3, 4, 5  is a sublist of  1, 2, 3, 4, 5  but not of  1, 2, 4, 5, 6 . Implement  this function with the following signature: fun hasSubList sub: List  : Boolean  hint You’ll first have to implement a startsWith function to determine whether a list starts  with a sublist. Once this is done, you’ll test this function recursively, starting from each  element of the list.   Common List abstractions     215  soLution An explicitly recursive startsWith function can be implemented in the List class, not  forgetting to disable variance check in the parameter: fun startsWith sub: List  : Boolean {     tailrec fun startsWith list: List , sub: List  : Boolean =             when  sub  {                 Nil  -> true                 is Cons -> when  list  {                     Nil  -> false                     is Cons -> if  list.head == sub.head                          startsWith list.tail, sub.tail                      else                         false                 }             }     return startsWith this, sub  }  From there, implementing hasSubList is straightforward: fun hasSubList sub: List  : Boolean {     tailrec     fun   hasSubList list: List , sub: List  : Boolean =             when  list  {                 Nil -> sub.isEmpty                   is Cons ->                     if  list.startsWith sub                           true                     else                         hasSubList list.tail, sub              }     return hasSubList this, sub  }  8.5.5  Miscellaneous functions for working with lists  You can develop many other useful functions for working with lists. The following exer- cises give you some practice in this domain. The proposed solutions are certainly not  the only ones. Feel free to invent your own. exercise 8.17 Create a groupBy function with the following characteristics:  ¡	It takes a function from A to B as a parameter. ¡	It returns a Map, where keys are the result of the function applied to each ele-  ment of the list, and values are lists of elements corresponding to each key.  For example, given a list of Payment instances such as data class Payment val name: String, val amount: Int    216  chapter 8  Advanced list handling  the following code should create a Map containing  key, value  pairs, where each key is  a name and the corresponding value is the list of Payment instances made by the corre- sponding person: val map: Map > = list.groupBy { x -> x.name }  hint Use  a  Kotlin  immutable  Map >.  To  add  value,  you  need  to  check  if  the  corresponding key is already in the map. If it’s found, you add the value to the list  corresponding to this key. Otherwise, you create a new binding from the key to a sin- gleton list containing the value to add. This can be done easily with the getOrDefault  function of the Map class. soLution Here’s an imperative version. There’s not much to say about it as it’s traditional imper- ative code with a local mutable state. If you want the order of elements to be main- tained in the sublists, you need to reverse the list first: fun   groupBy f:  A  -> B : Map > =     reverse  .foldLeft mapOf    { mt: Map > ->         { t ->             val key = f t              mt +  key to  mt[key] ?: Nil .cons t           }     }  Here, you can see the Elvis operator  ?:  in action because this example uses a Kotlin  immutable map which returns a nullable type. Using nullable types internally is per- fectly acceptable for safe programming as long as you don’t allow these types to leak  out of your functions. Here they do.  A better solution would be to use a map returning Result.Empty instead of null   when the key isn’t found. You could also use the getOrDefault function: fun   groupBy f:  A  -> B : Map > =     reverse  .foldLeft mapOf    { mt: Map > ->         { t ->             val k = f t              mt +  k to  mt.getOrDefault k, Nil  .cons t           }     }  A more idiomatic solution is to use the let function of the Kotlin standard library: fun   groupBy f:  A  -> B : Map > =     reverse  .foldLeft mapOf    { mt: Map > ->         { t ->             f t .let {                 mt +  it to  mt.getOrDefault it, Nil  .cons t               }         }     }   Common List abstractions     217  But  this  doesn’t  help  because  it  solves  the  problem  in  the  function,  where  it’s  not  needed, and not outside, where the caller can still use normal access returning null.  In  chapter  11,  you’ll  learn  how  to  create  your  own  immutable  Map  that  solves  this  problem.  Reversing  the  list  first  costs  some  time,  so  you  may  prefer  to  use  use  foldRight  instead of foldLeft. There’s a potential risk of blowing the stack, however. Here’s the  solution with foldRight: fun   groupBy f:  A  -> B : Map > =     foldRight mapOf    { t ->         {  mt: Map > ->             f t .let { mt +  it to  mt.getOrDefault it, Nil  .cons t   }         }     }  exercise 8.18 Write an unfold function that takes a starting element S and a function f from S to  Option >, and produces a List  by successively applying f to the S value  as long as the result is a Some. The following code should produce a list of integers  from 0 to 9: unfold 0  { i ->     if  i < 10          Option Pair i, i + 1       else         Option   }  soLution A simple non stack-safe recursive version is easy to implement: fun   unfold_ z: S, f:  S  -> Option > : List  =     f z .map { x ->                  unfold_ x.second, f .cons x.first               } .getOrElse List.Nil   Unfortunately, although this solution is smart, it’ll blow the stack for a little more than  1,000 recursion steps. To solve this problem, you can create a corecursive version: fun   unfold z: S, getNext:  S  -> Option > : List  {     tailrec fun unfold acc: List , z: S : List  {         val next = getNext z          return when  next  {             Option.None -> acc             is Option.Some ->                 unfold acc.cons next.value.first , next.value.second          }     }     return unfold List.Nil, z .reverse   }   218  chapter 8  Advanced list handling  The problem with this corecursive version is that you need to reverse the result. This  might not be important for small lists, but it can become annoying if the number of  elements grows too much.  This implementation requires that the Option class be in the same module as the   List class. A module is one of the following:  ¡	An IntelliJ IDEA module ¡	A Maven project ¡	A Gradle source set ¡	A set of files compiled with one invocation of an Ant task  For this exercise, the Option class has been copied from the common module to the  advancedlisthandling module. In a real situation, it would be the inverse, the List  class being in the common module.  Here’s an example of using unfold:  fun main args: Array   {     val f:  Int  -> Option > =         { it ->             if  it < 10_000  Option Pair it, it + 1   else Option           }     val result = unfold 0, f      println result  }  Here, the unfold function generates values until the next function returns None. If  you need to use a function that might produce an error, you can use the Result class  instead of Option: fun   unfold z: S,                   getNext:  S  -> Result > : Result > {     tailrec fun unfold acc: List , z: S : Result > {         val next = getNext z          return when  next  {             Result.Empty -> Result acc              is Result.Failure -> Result.failure next.exception              is Result.Success ->                 unfold acc.cons next.value.first , next.value.second          }     }     return unfold List.Nil, z .map List ::reverse  }  exercise 8.19 Write a range function that takes two integers as its parameters and produces a list of  all integers greater than or equal to the first and less than the second. hint You should use functions you’ve already defined.   Common List abstractions     219  soLution This is simple if you reuse the function from exercise 8.18: fun range start: Int, end: Int : List  {     return unfold start  { i ->         if  i < end              Option Pair i, i + 1           else             Option       } }  exercise 8.20 Create an exists function that takes a function from A to Boolean representing a con- dition and that returns true if the list contains at least one element satisfying this con- dition. Don’t use explicit recursion; build on the functions you’ve already defined. hint There’s no need to evaluate the condition for all elements of the list. The function  should return as soon as the first element satisfying the condition is found. soLution A recursive solution could be defined as follows: fun exists p: A  -> Boolean : Boolean =     when  this  {         Nil -> false         is Cons ->  p head   tail.exists p      }  Because  the    operator  evaluates  its  second  argument  lazily,  the  recursive  process  stops as soon as an element is found that satisfies the condition expressed by the pred- icate p.  But this is a non-tail-recursive stack-based function, and it’ll blow the stack if the list is  long and if no satisfying element is found in the first 1,000 or so elements. Incidentally,  it’ll also throw an exception if the list is empty, so you’d have to define an abstract func- tion in the List class with a specific implementation for the Nil subclass. A much better  solution consists in reusing the foldLeft function with a zero parameter: fun exists p:  A  -> Boolean : Boolean =         foldLeft false, true  { x -> { y: A -> x  p y  } }.first  exercise 8.21 Create a forAll function that takes a function from A to Boolean that represents a con- dition and that returns true if all the elements in the list satisfy this condition. hint Don’t use explicit recursion. And once again, you don’t always need to evaluate the  condition for all elements of the list. The forAll function will be similar to the exists  function.   220  chapter 8  Advanced list handling  soLution The solution is close to the  exists function with two differences—the identity and  zero values are inverted and the Boolean operator is && instead of : fun forAll p:  A  -> Boolean : Boolean =         foldLeft true, false  { x -> { y: A -> x && p y  } }.first  Another possibility is to reuse the exists function: fun forAll p:  A  -> Boolean : Boolean = !exists { !p it  }  This function checks whether an element exists that doesn’t meet the inverse of the  condition.  Automatic parallel processing of lists Most computations that are applied to lists resort to folds. A fold involves applying an  operation as many times as there are elements in the list. For long lists and long- lasting  operations,  a  fold  can  take  a  considerable  amount  of  time.  As  most  computers  are  now equipped with multicore processors  if not multiple processors , you might be  tempted to find a way to make the computer process a list in parallel.  In order to parallelize a fold, you need only one thing  beside a multicore processor,  of course : an additional operation allowing you to recompose the results of all parallel  computations.  8.6   8.6.1  Not all computations can be parallelized  Take the example of a list of integers. You can’t directly parallelize finding the mean of  all integers. You could break the list into four pieces  if you have a computer with four  processors  and compute the mean of each sublist. But you wouldn’t be able to com- pute the mean of the list from the means of the sublists.  On the other hand, computing the mean of a list implies computing the sum of all  elements and then dividing it by the number of elements. And computing the sum is  something that can easily be parallelized by computing the sums of the sublists, and  then computing the sum of the sublist sums.  This is a very particular example, where the operation used for the fold  the addi- tion  is the same as the operation used to assemble the sublist results. This isn’t always  the case. Take the example of a list of characters that’s folded by adding individual  characters to a String. To assemble the intermediate results, you need a different oper- ation: string concatenation.  8.6.2  Breaking the list into sublists  First, you must break the list into sublists, and you must do this automatically. One  important question is how many sublists you should obtain. Initially, you might think  that one sublist for each available processor would be ideal, but this isn’t exactly the  case. The number of processors  or, more precisely, the number of logical cores  isn’t  the most important factor.   Automatic parallel processing of lists     221  There’s a much more crucial question: will all sublist computations take the same amount of time? Probably not, but this depends on the type of computation. If you were to divide the list into four sublists because you decided to dedicate four threads to the parallel processing, some threads might finish quickly, although others might have to make a much longer computation. This would ruin the benefit of parallelization because it might result in most of the computing task being handled by a single thread. A much better solution is to divide the list into a large number of sublists, and then submit each sublist to a pool of threads. This way, as soon as a thread finishes process- ing a sublist, it’s handed a new one to process. Your first task is to create a function that divides a list into sublists. exercise function that divides a list into a number of sublists. The Write a list will be divided in two, and each sublist recursively divided in two, with the   depth parameter representing the number of recursion steps. This function will be imple- mented in the fun divide depth: Int : List >  8.22 divide depth: Int   parent class with the following signature:  List  hint You’ll  first  instead of a following signature: fun splitListAt index: Int : List >  new  define  Pair<List,   version  List>. Let’s call this function    splitAt  the  of   a   function   that   returns   splitListAt  a   of   list   lists and give it the  soLution The fun splitListAt index: Int : List > {  splitListAt  function is a slightly modified version of the  tailrec fun splitListAt acc: List ,  list: List , i: Int : List > =  splitAt    function:  when  list  {  Nil -> List list.reverse  , acc  is Cons ->  if  i == 0   List list.reverse  , acc   else  }  return when {  splitListAt acc.cons list.head , list.tail, i - 1   index   splitListAt 0  index > length   -> splitListAt length    else             ->  splitListAt Nil, this.reverse  , this.length   - index   }  }  tailrec  This function always returns a list of two lists. Then you can define the as follows: fun divide depth: Int : List > {  divide  function                                                                                         222  chapter  8     Advanced list handling  fun divide list: List >, depth: Int : List > =  when  list  {  Nil -> list    dead code is Cons ->  if  list.head.length   < 2  depth < 1   list  else  divide list.flatMap { x ->  x.splitListAt x.length     2   }, depth - 1   }  return if  this.isEmpty     List this   else  divide List this , depth   }  8.6.3   Nil  case of the Nil  The be called with note that you don’t really need the steps will only be long that it would cause a stack overflow.  when as its parameter.

A customer enters and sits. You have two options:  1  You prepare an espresso, press an orange juice, bring the two to the customer,   and let them choose.  2  You ask the customer what they’d like to have, prepare it, and serve it.  In programming terms, in the second case, you’re being lazy, whereas in the first  case, you’re being strict. Choosing the best strategy is up to you. This chapter isn’t  about morals, but about efficiency.  In this case, there are other options. You could eagerly prepare an espresso and an  orange juice before any customer enters. Once a customer comes in, ask the person   225   226  chapter  9     Working with laziness  9.7   to pick what they want, serve what’s requested, and immediately make a beverage in preparation for the next customer. Seems crazy? Not so.  Imagine you’re also offering apple pies and strawberry pies. Would you wait for a cus- tomer to enter and choose one kind of pie to prepare it? Or would you eagerly prepare one of each kind? If you choose to be lazy, you would wait for the customer to choose, let’s say apple pie. Then you’d prepare an apple pie, cut a slice, and bring it to the cus- tomer. This would be the lazy approach, although you’d have at the same time prepared the other apple pie slices.  Programming languages work the same. And as in the example, the normal way is generally so obvious that no one even thinks about it, unless a problem arises. In the first part of this chapter, I compare strictness and laziness. While Kotlin is a strict lan- guage, you can still use laziness. For the rest of the chapter, I’ll teach various laziness-   related skills in Kotlin: how to implement laziness, how to compose with laziness, how to create a lazy list data structure, and finally, how to handle infinite streams.  Strictness versus laziness Some languages are said to be lazy; others are strict. Generally, this is about how lan- guages evaluate function or method arguments. But in reality, all languages are lazy because laziness is the true essence of programming.  Programming consists of composing program instructions that’ll be evaluated when the program is eventually run. If full strictness were enforced, each single instruction you write would be executed as soon as you pressed the Enter key, which is, in fact, what happens when you use a REPL  Read, Eval, Print Loop .  Setting apart the fact that a program is basically a lazy construct, are programs writ- ten in strict languages like Kotlin or Java a composition of strict elements? Certainly not. Strict languages are strict regarding method function argument evaluation, but most other constructs are lazy. Take the example of an val result = if  testCondition     structure:  if...else  getIfTrue    else  getIfFalse       if...else  testCondition. Although the  testCondition   getIfFalse  function will always be evaluated. But only one of the Obviously, the functions will be called, depending on the value returned and getIfTrue structure is strict regarding the condition, by were effects, you it’s lazy regarding the two branches. If couldn’t do anything useful with a totally strict because both effects would be executed in any case. On the contrary, if these were functions, it wouldn’t change the outcome of the program. Both values would be computed, but only the one cor- responding to the condition would be returned. This would be a waste of processing time, but it would still be usable.  getIfFalse  getIfTrue  if...else  and  Strictness and laziness apply not only to control structures and function arguments,  but to everything in programming. For example, consider the following declaration: val x: Int = 2 + 3                                                                                                             Kotlin and strictness     227  x  is immediately evaluated to  Here, the addition immediately. Let’s look at another example: val x: Int = getValue    5. Because Kotlin is a strict language, it performs  x  reference is declared, the  In Kotlin, as soon as the vide the corresponding value. On the other hand, with a lazy language, the function would only be called if and when the value referenced by This can make a huge difference. For example, look at the following program: fun main args: Array   {    function is called to pro- getValue   getValue were to be used.  x  val x = getValue    fun getValue  : Int {  println "Returning 5"  return 5  }  }  9.8   This program prints function will be called, although the returned value will never be used. In a lazy language, nothing would be evaluated, so nothing would be printed to the console.  to the console because the  Returning     getValue  5  Kotlin and strictness is supposed to be a strict language. Everything is evaluated immediately. Func- Kotlin tion arguments are said to be passed by value, which means they’re first evaluated and then the evaluated value is passed. On the other hand, in lazy languages, arguments are said to be passed by name, which means unevaluated. Don’t be confused by the fact that function arguments in Kotlin are often references. References are addresses, and these addresses are passed by value.  Some languages are strict  like Kotlin and Java , and others are lazy; some are strict by default and are optionally lazy, and others are lazy by default and are optionally strict. Kotlin, however, isn’t always strict.

Are you done? Running this program displays the following result on the console: true true true false true false false false  So far, so good.

Kotlin does, in fact, use laziness for constructs block, for exam-    if...then, loops, and  blocks. Without this, a  try...catch  catch  Implementing laziness is a must when it comes to providing behavior for errors, as well as when you need to manipulate infinite data structures. Kotlin provides a way to implement laziness through the use of a delegate. Here’s how it works val first: Boolean by Delegate    Delegate  where operator fun getValue thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty  : Boolean  is a class implementing the following function:  Note two important things:    1    2    class, which can have any name you choose, doesn’t need to imple- The Delegate ment any interface.

But you can reach the same goal by using the right types. Think about what you did in chapters 5, 6, and 7. In chapter 7, you learned to abstract lists into two related concepts—the elements' type and something else, which was repre- sented by the type. This “something else” was a compound concept covering car- dinality  there can be any number of elements including 0, 1, or more , as well as the fact that those elements were ordered. You could have pushed abstraction further by distinguishing  a whole. The result was the parameterized type  think  List .  cardinality   concept   order.   about   let’s   and   List  List  But   the   as   of  In chapter 6, you learned to abstract the concept of optionality into two related con- type. And in chapter 7, you cepts: the type of the data  let’s call it Result . learned to abstract the possibility of error into another compound type, A, and on the other As you can see, there’s a pattern. On one side, you’ve a simple type side, you’ve a kind of modality applied to this simple type. Laziness can be considered another modality, so you can certainly implement it as a type. Let’s call it  A  and the  Lazy .  Option  You could object that laziness can be represented in a much simpler way by using a constant function. As you know, because you’ve already used this concept in the pre- vious chapters, a constant function is a function taking any argument of any type and always returning the same value. Such a function might have the following type:    -> Int  Here the function returns an val x:    -> Int = { 5 }  Int. To create a lazy integer value, you can write  This is silly because 5 is a literal, and it makes no sense to lazily initialize a reference to a literal value. But if you switch back to our previous example using lazy Booleans, you get this: fun main args: Array   {  val first = { true } val second = { throw IllegalStateException   } println first    second    println or first, second    }  fun or a:    -> Boolean, b:    -> Boolean : Boolean = if  a    true else b                                                                                                                             Laziness implementations     231  This works as expected, producing true true  with   difference   One  changed the types.

This type of evaluation is called call by need. If you remember what you learned in chapter 4, you know the answer is memoization. exercise 9.1 Implement a usable in the following example: fun main args: Array   {  type that works like a memoized function     → A.

It’s also possible to define lazy exercise 9.3 Write a lazy soLution No real difficulties here: val constructMessage:  Lazy   ->   Lazy   -> Lazy  =  curried version of the  constructMessage  function.  val  { greetings ->  { name ->  }  }  Lazy { "${greetings  }, ${name  }!" }  fun main args: Array   {  val greetings = Lazy {  println "Evaluating greetings"  "Hello"  } val name1: Lazy  = Lazy {  println "Evaluating name"  "Mickey"  } val name2: Lazy  = Lazy {  println "Evaluating name"  "Donald"  } val message1 = constructMessage greetings  name1  val message2 = constructMessage greetings  name2  val condition = Random System.currentTimeMillis   .nextInt   % 2 == 0 println if  condition  message1   else defaultMessage    println if  condition  message2   else defaultMessage     }  The result is exactly the same, but the syntax for calling the function had to be adapted. This is a good example of the use of curried functions. You might need to greet many persons with the same message but with a different name. This could then be imple- mented as val constructMessage:  Lazy   ->   Lazy   -> Lazy  =  { greetings ->                                               Laziness implementations     235              { name ->                 Lazy { "${greetings  }, ${name  }!" }             }         }  fun main args: Array   {     val greetings = Lazy {         println "Evaluating greetings"          "Hello"     }     val name1: Lazy  = Lazy {         println "Evaluating name1"          "Mickey"     }     val name2: Lazy  = Lazy {         println "Evaluating name2"          "Donald"     }     val defaultMessage = Lazy {         println "Evaluating default message"          "No greetings when time is odd"     }     val greetingString = constructMessage greetings      val message1 = greetingString name1      val message2 = greetingString name2      val condition = Random System.currentTimeMillis   .nextInt   % 2 == 0     println if  condition  message1   else defaultMessage        println if  condition  message2   else defaultMessage    }  9.10.2  Lifting functions  Often, you’ll have a function working on some evaluated values and you’ll want to use  this function with unevaluated ones without causing evaluation. After all, this is the  essence of programming. exercise 9.4 Create a function that takes as its argument a curried function of two evaluated argu- ments and returns the corresponding function for an unevaluated argument that pro- duces the same, but nonevaluated result. Given the function val consMessage:  String  ->  String  -> String =     { greetings ->         { name ->             "$greetings, $name!"         }     }  write a function named lift2 that produces the following function  without evaluat- ing any argument :  Lazy   ->   Lazy   -> Lazy    236  chapter 9  Working with laziness  hint Put  this  function  in  the  Lazy  companion  object  in  order  to  prevent  clashing  with  another implementation of lift2. Alternatively, you can declare this function at pack- age level and change its name, for example, to liftLazy2. soLution First, write the signature of the function. The lift2 function takes as its argument a  function of type  String  →  String  → String. This argument type should be put  between parentheses and followed by an arrow as shown here:   String  ->  String  -> String  ->  Then write the return type of this function:   String  ->  String  -> String  ->  Lazy   ->   Lazy                                                               -> Lazy   Add the val lift2: to the left of this expression and the equals sign to the right: val lift2:   String  ->  String  -> String  ->  Lazy   ->                                              Lazy   -> Lazy  =  Now write the implementation. As it should produce a function of type   Lazy   →  Lazy   → Lazy ,  you can start with  { f → { ls1 → { ls2 → TODO   } } },  where f is of type  String  →  String  → String   the function to lift  and ls1 and  ls2 are of type Lazy : val lift2:   String  ->  String  -> String  ->  Lazy   ->      Lazy   -> Lazy  =         { f ->             { ls1 ->                 { ls2 ->                     TODO                   }             }         }  The rest is now simple. You have a curried function of two String arguments and two  instances of Lazy . Get the values and apply the function. Because you want to  get a Lazy , create a Lazy instance of the result: val lift2:   String  ->  String  -> String  ->  Lazy   ->      Lazy   -> Lazy  =         { f ->             { ls1 ->                 { ls2 ->                     Lazy { f ls1    ls2    }                 }             }         }   Laziness implementations     237  to   any   this   with   type.   work   function   exercise 9.5 Generalize  package level. soLution Start with the signature.

Once this is done, wrap the implementation into a new import com.fpinkotlin.common.sequence  Lazy:  fun   sequenceResult lst: List > : Lazy >> =  Lazy { sequence lst.map { Result.of it  }  }  You also need to explicitly import the with the traverse  sequence function you created in chapter 8:    function. This makes the distinction function defined at a package level. Another possibility is to use the    sequence  fun   sequenceResult2 lst: List > : Lazy >> =  Lazy { traverse lst  { Result.of it  } }  Failure. The reason is that the  Evaluating the result causes all elements of the list to be evaluated, even if one evalua- tion results in a   foldRight function. To make evaluation stop as soon as one element evaluates to a Failure, you’d is equivalent to have to use an escaping fold.

You can use it here: fun   sequenceResult list: List > : Lazy >> =  foldRight, but you developed an escaping  foldLeft  in  val p = { r: Result > -> r.map{false}.getOrElse true  } list.foldLeft Result List   , p  { y: Result > ->  { x: Lazy  ->  map2 Result.of x , y  { a: A ->  { b: List  ->  b.cons a   }  }  }  }  }  Lazy {  }  }  }    9.11  9.11.1    You could define an escaping  traverse  in the list class in order to abstract this process.  Further lazy compositions As you can see, lazily composing functions is a matter of writing the normal compo- sition  compose anything you want in a lazy way. There’s no magic here. You can always do the same by wrapping any implementation in a constant function: fun   lazyComposition  : Lazy  =  technique,   wrapping   instance.

To allow Kotlin to select the right function, you’ll  have to specify explicitly the type of each handler such as in this example: val printMessage:  Any  -> Unit = ::println val printDefault:    -> Unit = { println defaultMessage } list1.forEach condition, printMessage, printDefault   The reason for this is that a handler such as {} is valid for arguments of both types    A  → Unit and    → Unit.  If you want to use the default value for the ifTrue:    → Unit argument  meaning   doing nothing , you’ll have to name the argument on the call site: val printMessage:  Any  -> Unit = ::println list1.forEach condition, ifFalse = printMessage   9.11.2  Things you can’t do without laziness  So far it may seem that the absence of true laziness in evaluating expressions in Kotlin isn’t  a big deal. After all, why should you bother rewriting Boolean functions when you can use  Boolean operators? There are, however, other cases where laziness is really useful. There  are even several algorithms that can’t be implemented without resorting to laziness. I’ve  already talked about how useless a strict version of if ... else would be. But think about  the following algorithm:  1  Take the list of positive integers. 2  Filter the primes. 3  Return the list of the first ten results.  This is an algorithm for finding the first ten primes, but this algorithm can’t be imple- mented without laziness. If you don’t believe me, try it. Start with the first line. If you’re  strict, you’ll first evaluate the list of positive integers. You’ll never have the opportunity  to go to the second line because the list of integers is infinite, and you’ll exhaust avail- able memory before reaching the  nonexistent  end.  Clearly, this algorithm can’t be implemented without laziness, but you know how to  replace it with a different algorithm. The preceding algorithm was functional. If you  want to find the result without resorting to laziness, you’ll have to replace it with an  imperative algorithm, like this one:  1  Take the first integer. 2  Check whether it’s a prime. 3  If it is, store it in a list. 4  Check whether the resulting list has ten elements. 5  If it has ten elements, return it as the result. 6  If not, increment the integer by 1. 7  Go to line 2.   Further lazy compositions     245  Sure, it works. But what a mess! First, it’s a bad recipe. Shouldn’t you increment the  tested integer by 2 rather than by 1 in order to not test even numbers? And why test  multiples of 3, 5, and so on? But more importantly, it doesn’t express the nature of the  problem. It’s only a recipe for computing the result.  This isn’t to say that the implementation details  such as not testing even numbers   aren’t  important  for  getting  good  performance.  But  these  implementation  details  should be clearly separated from the problem definition. The imperative description  isn’t a description of the problem. It’s a description of another problem giving the same  result. A much more elegant solution is to solve this kind of problem with a special  structure: the lazy list.  9.11.3  Creating a lazy list data structure  Now that you know how to represent non-evaluated data as instances of Lazy, you can  easily define a lazy list data structure. You’ll call it Stream, and it’ll be similar to the sin- gly linked list you developed in chapter 5 with some subtle, but important, differences.  The following listing shows the starting point of your Stream data type.  Listing 9.3    The Stream data type  The Lazy class isn’t imported here  because it’s in the same package.  The Stream class is sealed to   prevent direct instantiation.  import com.fpinkotlin.common.Result   sealed class Stream  {       abstract fun isEmpty  : Boolean      abstract fun head  : Result    The head function returns a Result   so that it can return Empty when called  on an empty stream.  For the same reason, the  tail function returns a  Result >.  The Empty subclass is  exactly the same as the  List.Nil subclass.  The head  called hd  is  non-evaluated, taking the  form of a Lazy .      abstract fun tail  : Result >       private object Empty: Stream    {           override fun head  : Result  = Result            override fun tail  : Result  = Result            override fun isEmpty  : Boolean = true  A non-empty stream  is represented by  the Cons subclass.      }      private     class Cons   internal val hd: Lazy ,                         internal val tl: Lazy > :                                           Stream    {           override fun head  : Result  = Result hd     Similarly, the tail  tl  is  represented by a  Lazy >.  override fun tail  : Result > = Result tl      246  chapter 9  Working with laziness          override fun isEmpty  : Boolean = false     }      companion object {  The cons function constructs a Stream by  calling the private Cons constructor.          fun   cons hd: Lazy ,                      tl: Lazy > : Stream  =                                     Cons hd, tl            operator fun   invoke  : Stream  =                                     Empty   The invoke operator function  returns the Empty singleton object.          fun from i: Int : Stream  =             cons Lazy { i }, Lazy { from i + 1  }       } }  The from factory function  returns an infinite stream of  successive integers starting  from the given value.  Here’s an example of how to use this Stream type: fun main args: Array   {     val stream = Stream.from 1      stream.head  .forEach { println it  }      stream.tail  .flatMap { it.head   }.forEach { println it  }      stream.tail  .flatMap {                 it.tail  .flatMap { it.head   }             }.forEach { println it  }  }  This program prints the following: 1 2 3  This probably doesn’t seem useful. To make some functions to it. But first, you must optimize it slightly.  Stream  a valuable tool, you’ll need to add       generators.  It’s important to understand the difference between the  described NOTE Stream, which in this chapter, which is a lazily evaluated list, and what Java calls are  from element  next  some current state, which might be the previous element or anything else. In particular, this external state can be an already evaluated indexed collection plus an index. This is the case when you use a Java construct such as  Generators    functions   compute   Stream  that   the   are   List  list = .... list.stream  ...  In this Java example, the generator uses the pair  list, index  as the mutable state from which the new value is generated. In such a case, the generator depends on an exter- nal mutable state. On the other hand, once the value is evaluated  through a terminal operation , the stream can no longer be used. Kotlin also offers generators such as the Sequence  construct, although unlike Java, it doesn’t handle parallel processing.  This is different from the  you’re defining, in which data is unevaluated but can become partially evaluated while not preventing reusing the stream. In the previous  Stream                                                   Handling streams     247  example, you caused evaluation of the first three values of the stream, but this doesn’t  prevent reusing the stream, as you can see in the following example: fun main args: Array   {     val stream = Stream.from 1      stream.head  .forEach { println it  }      stream.tail  .flatMap { it.head   }.forEach { println it  }      stream.tail  .flatMap { it.tail               .flatMap { it.head   } }.forEach { println it  }      stream.head  .forEach { println it  }      stream.tail  .flatMap { it.head   }.forEach { println it  }      stream.tail  .flatMap { it.tail               .flatMap { it.head   } }.forEach { println it  }  }  This programs displays 1 2 3 1 2 3  }  }  9.12   On the other hand, the following Java program would cause an with the message “stream has already been operated upon or closed”: public class TestStream {  public static void main String... args  {  Stream  stream = Stream.iterate 0, i -> i + 1 ; stream.findFirst  .ifPresent System.out::println ; stream.findFirst  .ifPresent System.out::println ;    IllegalStateException  Kotlin offers the erated values, so it’s not a lazy list either.

But in order to look at the streams, you’ll need a function to evaluate them. And to evaluate a stream, you need a function to limit its length. You wouldn’t want to evaluate an infinite stream, would you? exercise Create a function ing a stream of A. soLution There’s  You  argument with a lazy call to the fun   repeat f:    -> A : Stream  =  taking as its argument a function of type  to  function itself:  need  repeat  and return-  difficulty   construct  function  repeat   cons      → A  here.   9.11  lazy   call   the   no   to   a   cons Lazy { f   }, Lazy { repeat f  }   This function won’t cause any stack problem because the call to the  repeat  function is lazy.                                                                   248  chapter 9  Working with laziness  exercise 9.12 Create a takeAtMost function to limit the length of a stream to at most n elements.

On the other hand, the function has to call itself recursively 60,000 times in order for the resulting stream to start with the 60,001st element. This recursion occurs even if no element is evaluated.  dropAtMost  takeAtMost  dropAtMost  The solution is to make  corecursive, which usually necessitates using two additional arguments: the stream on which the function is operating and an accumu- lator for the result. But in this particular case, you don’t need an accumulator because the result of each recursive step is ignored.

If you create a function  with side effects such as this one fun inc i: Int : Int =  i + 1 .let {     println "generating $it"      it }  you can check that the following test program only evaluates values from 0 to 10,010  before printing a list of 10 values from 10,000 to 10,009: fun main args: Array   {     fun inc i: Int : Int =  i + 1 .let {         println "generating $it"          it     }     val list = Stream                     .iterate 0, ::inc                      .takeAtMost 60000                      .dropAtMost 10000                      .takeAtMost 10                      .toList       println list  }  You could also create an iterate function taking a Lazy  as its seed if you needed to  start with an unevaluated seed: fun   iterate seed: Lazy , f:  A  -> A : Stream  =                     cons seed, Lazy { iterate f seed   , f  }   exercise 9.17 Write a takeWhile function that returns a Stream containing all starting elements as  long as a condition is matched. Here’s the function signature in the Stream parent  class: abstract fun takeWhile p:  A  -> Boolean : Stream   hint Be  aware  that  unlike  takeAtMost  and  dropAtMost,  this  function  evaluates  one  ele- ment because it’ll have to test the first element to verify whether it fulfills the condition  expressed by the predicate. You should verify that only the first element of the stream  is evaluated. soLution This function is similar to the takeAtMost function. The main difference is that the  terminal condition is no longer n ≤ 0 but the provided function returning false: override fun takeWhile p:  A  -> Boolean : Stream  = when {     p hd    -> cons hd, Lazy { tl  .takeWhile p  }      else -> Empty }   252  chapter 9  Working with laziness  Once again, you don’t need to make the function stack-safe because the recursive call  is unevaluated.

Here’s the signature in the Stream parent class: fun dropWhile p:  A  -> Boolean : Stream   hint You’ll need to write a corecursive version of this function in order to make it stack-safe. soLution As in previous recursive functions, the solution will include a function in the Stream  class calling a stack-safe corecursive helper function in the companion object.

The rest of the list wasn’t examined because the  operator is lazy and doesn’t evalu- ate its second argument if the first one evaluates to true.  Create an exists function for Stream. The function should cause elements to be  evaluated only until the condition is met. If the condition is never met, all elements will  be evaluated. soLution A simple solution could be similar to the exists function in List: fun exists p:  A  -> Boolean : Boolean = p hd     tl  .exists p    9.12.1  Folding streams  Handling streams     253  You should make it stack-safe. In order to write a stack-safe implementation, you must  make it tail-recursive. Here’s a possible implementation in the companion object: tailrec fun   exists stream: Stream , p:  A  -> Boolean : Boolean =     when  stream  {         Empty -> false         is Cons  -> when {             p stream.hd    -> true             else           -> exists stream.tl  , p          }     }  And here’s the main function in the Stream class: fun exists p:  A  -> Boolean : Boolean = exists this, p   In chapter 5, you saw how to abstract recursion into fold functions, and you learned  how to fold lists right or left. Folding streams is a bit different. Although the principle  is the same, the main difference is that streams are unevaluated.  A recursive operation could overflow the stack and cause a StackOverflowExcep- tion to be thrown, but a description of a recursive operation won’t. The consequence  is that in many cases foldRight, which can’t be made stack-safe in List, won’t overflow  the stack in Stream. It will overflow it, however, if it implies evaluating each operation,  such as adding the elements of a Stream . It won’t if instead of evaluating an oper- ation, it constructs a description of an unevaluated one.  Conversely, the List implementation of foldRight based on foldLeft  which can  be made stack-safe  can’t be used with streams because it requires reversing the stream.  This would cause the evaluation of all elements; it might even be impossible in the  case of an infinite stream. And the stack-safe version of foldLeft can’t be used either  because it inverts the direction of the computation. exercise 9.20 Create a foldRight function for streams. This function will be similar to the List. foldRight function, but you should take care of laziness. hint Laziness is expressed by the elements being Lazy  instead of A. The signature of the  function in the Stream parent class will be abstract fun   foldRight z: Lazy ,                            f:  A  ->  Lazy   -> B : B  soLution The implementation in the Empty class is obvious: override fun   foldRight z: Lazy ,                            f:  Nothing  ->  Lazy   -> B : B = z     254  chapter 9  Working with laziness  And here’s the Cons implementation: override fun   foldRight z: Lazy ,                            f:  A  ->  Lazy   -> B : B =                                      f hd    Lazy { tl  .foldRight z, f  }   This function isn’t stack-safe, so it shouldn’t be used for such computations as the sum  of a list of more than about a thousand integers. You’ll see, however, that it has many  interesting use cases. exercise 9.21 Implement the takeWhile function in terms of foldRight, calling it takeWhileVia- FoldRight. Verify how it behaves on long lists. soLution The starting value is a Lazy of an empty stream. The function tests the current element   p a  . If the result is true  meaning that the element fulfills the condition expressed  by the predicate p , a stream is returned by “consing” a Lazy  {  a  } to the current  stream: fun takeWhileViaFoldRight p:  A  -> Boolean : Stream  =     foldRight Lazy { Empty }, { a ->         { b: Lazy > ->             if  p a                   cons Lazy { a }, b              else                 Empty         }     }   As you can verify by running the tests provided in the code accompanying this book   https:  github.com pysaumont fpinkotlin , this function won’t overflow the stack,  even for streams longer than one million elements. This is because foldRight doesn’t  evaluate  the  result  by  itself.  Evaluation  depends  on  the  function  used  to  make  the  fold. If this function constructs a new stream  as it does in the case of takeWhile , this  stream isn’t evaluated. exercise 9.22 Implement headSafe using foldRight. This function should return either a Result  .Success of the head element or Result.Empty if the stream is empty. soLution The starting element is a non-evaluated empty stream  Lazy { Empty } . This’ll be the  returned value if the stream is empty. The function used to fold the stream ignores the  second argument, so the first time it’s applied to the hd element, it returns Result a .  This result never changes: fun headSafeViaFoldRight  : Result  =       foldRight Lazy { Result    }, { a -> { Result a  } }    Handling streams     255  exercise 9.23 Implement map in terms of foldRight. Verify that this function doesn’t evaluate any of  the stream elements. soLution Start with a Lazy of an empty stream. The function used to make the fold will cons  a non-evaluated application of the function to the current element with the current  result: fun   map f:  A  -> B : Stream  =     foldRight Lazy { Empty }, { a ->         { b: Lazy > ->             cons Lazy { f a  }, b          }     }   exercise 9.24 Implement filter in terms of foldRight. Verify that this function doesn’t evaluate  more stream elements than needed. soLution Again, start with a non-evaluated empty stream. The function used to fold applies the  filter to the current argument. If the result is true, the element is used to create a new  stream by “consing” it with the current stream result. Otherwise, the current stream  result is left unchanged  calling b   doesn’t evaluate any elements : fun filter p:  A  -> Boolean : Stream  =      foldRight Lazy { Empty }, { a ->          { b: Lazy > ->              if  p a   cons Lazy { a }, b  else b            }      }   This function evaluates the stream elements until the first match is found. See the cor- responding tests in the accompanying code for details. exercise 9.25 Implement append in terms of foldRight. The append function should be lazy in its  argument. hint Beware of variance! soLution This  function  takes  a  Lazy >  as  its  argument,  so  A  is  in  the  in  position,  although the parameter of the Stream class is declared out. As a result, you must dis- able variance checking by using the @UnsafeVariance annotation.   256  chapter 9  Working with laziness  The starting element is the  non-evaluated  stream you want to append. The folding  function creates a new stream by adding the current element to the current result using  the cons function: fun append stream2: Lazy > : Stream  =         this.foldRight stream2  { a: A ->             { b: Lazy > ->                 Stream.cons Lazy { a }, b              }         }  exercise 9.26 Implement flatMap in terms of foldRight. soLution Again, you start with an unevaluated empty stream. The function is applied to the cur- rent element, producing a stream to which the current result is appended. This has the  effect of flattening the result  transforming a Stream > into a Stream  : fun   flatMap f:  A  -> Stream  : Stream  =     foldRight Lazy { Empty as Stream  }, { a ->         { b: Lazy > ->             f a .append b          }     }   9.12.2  Tracing evaluation and function application  It’s important to notice the consequence of laziness. With strict collections such as lists,  applying a map, a filter, and a new map successively would imply iterating over the list  three times as shown here: import com.fpinkotlin.common.List  private val f = { x: Int ->     println "Mapping " + x      x * 3 }  private val p = { x: Int ->     println "Filtering " + x      x % 2 == 0 }  fun main args: Array   {     val list = List 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 .map f .filter p      println list  }  As you can see, functions f and p aren’t pure functions because they log to the console.  This’ll help you understanding what’s happening. This program prints the following: Mapping 1 Mapping 2 Mapping 3 Mapping 4   Handling streams     257  This shows that all elements are processed by function f, implying a full traversal of the  list. Then all elements are processed by function p, implying a second full traversal of  the list that results from the first map. By contrast, look at the following program, which  uses a Stream instead of a List: fun main args: Array   {     val stream = Stream.from 1 .takeAtMost 5 .map f .filter p      println stream.toList    }  Mapping 5 Filtering 15 Filtering 12 Filtering 9 Filtering 6 Filtering 3 [6, 12, NIL]  This is the output: Mapping 1 Filtering 3 Mapping 2 Filtering 6 Mapping 3 Filtering 9 Mapping 4 Filtering 12 Mapping 5 Filtering 15 15 [6, 12, NIL]  You can see that the stream traversal occurs only once. First the element 1 is mapped  with f, giving 3. Then 3 is filtered  and discarded because it’s not an even number .  Then 2 is mapped with f, giving 6, which is filtered and kept for the result.  As you can see, the laziness of streams lets you compose the descriptions of the com- putations rather than their results. The evaluation of the elements is reduced to the min- imum. The following result is obtained if you use unevaluated values to construct the  stream and an evaluating function with logging when removing the printing of the result: generating 1 Mapping 1 Filtering 3 generating 2 Mapping 2 Filtering 6  You can see that only the first two elements are evaluated. The rest of the evaluations were the result of the final printing. exercise Write a eter and returns a predicate, or  Boolean  as a param- if an element is found to match the  function that takes a predicate  a function from  Result . This will be  9.27 find  otherwise.  Success  Empty  to  A                           258  chapter 9  Working with laziness  hint You should have nearly nothing to write. Combine two of the functions you’ve written  in the previous sections. soLution Compose the filter function with head: fun find p:  A  -> Boolean : Result  = filter p .head    9.12.3  Applying streams to concrete problems  In the following exercise, you’ll apply streams to concrete problems. By doing so, you’ll  realize how solving problems with streams is different from the traditional approach. exercise 9.28 Write a fibs function that generates the infinite stream of Fibonacci numbers 1, 1, 2,  3, 5, 8, and so on. hint Consider  producing  an  intermediate  stream  of  pair  of  integers  using  the  iterate  function. soLution The solution consists in creating a stream of pairs  x, y  with x and y being two succes- sive Fibonacci numbers. Once this stream is produced, you need to map it with a func- tion from a pair to its first element: fun fibs  : Stream  =     Stream.iterate Pair 1, 1   { x ->         Pair x.second, x.first + x.second      }.map { x -> x.first }   This can be simplified using destructuring: fun fibs  : Stream  = Stream.iterate Pair 1, 1   {      x, y  ->  Pair y, x + y  }.map { it.first }  In this example,  x, y  is directly initialized with the first and second element of the  Pair, transforming the Pair into a tuple of its properties. It’s the inverse of Pair x, y ,  where two values, x and y, are structured into a Pair, hence the name destructuring. exercise 9.29 The iterate function can be further generalized. Write an unfold function that takes  as its parameters a starting state of type S and a function from S to Result<Pair<A,  S>>,  and  returns  a  stream  of  A.  Returning  a  Result  makes  it  possible  to  indicate  whether the stream should stop or continue.  Using a state S means that the source of data generation doesn’t have to be of the  same type as the generated data. To apply this new function, write new versions of fibs  and from in terms of the unfold function. Here’s the unfold signature: fun   unfold z: S, f:  S  -> Result > : Stream    Handling streams     259  soLution To start, apply the f function to the initial state z. This produces a Result<Pair<A,  S>>. Then map this result with a function from a Pair , producing a stream by  “consing” the first member of the pair  the A value  with a  non-evaluated  recursive  call to unfold and using the second member of the pair as the initial state. The result  of this mapping is either Success > or Empty. Then use getOrElse to return  either the contained stream or a default empty stream: fun   unfold z: S, f:  S  -> Result > : Stream  =     f z .map { x ->                 Stream.cons Lazy { x.first }, Lazy { unfold x.second, f  }               }.getOrElse Stream.Empty   Even simpler, you can use destructuring again: fun   unfold z: S, f:  S  -> Result > : Stream  =     f z .map {  a, s  ->         Stream.cons Lazy { a }, Lazy { unfold s, f  }      }.getOrElse Stream.Empty   The new version of from uses the integer seed as the initial state and a function from  Int to Pair . Here the state is of the same type as the value: fun from n: Int : Stream  = unfold n  { x -> Result Pair x, x + 1   }  The fibs function makes more complete use of the unfold function. The state is a  Pair , and the function produces a Pair >: fun fibs  : Stream  =     Stream.unfold Pair 1, 1   { x ->         Result Pair x.first, Pair x.second, x.first + x.second        }  You can see how compact and elegant these function implementations are! exercise 9.30 Using foldRight to implement various functions is a smart technique. Unfortunately,  it doesn’t work for filter. If you test this function with a predicate that’s not matched  by more than 1,000 or 2,000 consecutive elements, it overflows the stack. Write a stack- safe filter function. hint The problem comes from long sequences of elements for which the predicate returns  false. Think of a way to get rid of these elements. soLution The solution is to remove the long series of elements that return false by using the  dropWhile function. To do this, you must reverse the condition  !p x   and then test  the resulting stream for emptiness. If the stream is empty, return it.  Any empty stream  will do because the empty stream is a singleton.  If the stream isn’t empty, create a new  stream by “consing” the head with the filtered tail.   260  chapter 9  Working with laziness  Because the head function returns a pair, you must use the first element of this  pair as the head element of the stream. In theory, you should use the right element  of  the  pair  for  any  further  access.  Not  doing  so  would  cause  a  new  evaluation  of  the head. But as you don’t access the head a second time, only the tail, you can use  stream.getTail   instead. This allows avoiding the use of a local variable to refer- ence the result of stream.head  : fun filter p:  A  -> Boolean : Stream   =    dropWhile { x -> !p x  }.let { stream ->        when  stream  {            is Empty -> stream            is Cons -> cons stream.hd, Lazy { stream.tl  .filter p }         }    }  Another possibility is to use the head function. This function returns a Result  that  can be mapped to produce the new stream through a recursive call. In the end, this  produces  a  Result >  that  will  be  empty  if  no  elements  satisfy  the  predi- cate. All that remains to be done is to call getOrElse on this Result, passing an empty  stream as the default value: fun filter2 p:  A  -> Boolean : Stream  =     dropWhile { x -> !p x  }.let { stream ->         when  stream  {             is Empty -> stream             is Cons -> stream.head  .map { a ->                  cons Lazy { a }, Lazy { stream.tl  .filter p  }               } .getOrElse Empty          }     }  Summary  ¡	Strict evaluation means evaluating values as soon as they’re referenced. ¡	Lazy evaluation means evaluating values only if and when they’re needed. ¡	Some  languages  are  strict  and  others  are  lazy.  Some  are  lazy  by  default  and   optionally strict, others are strict by default and optionally lazy.  ¡	Kotlin is a strict language. It’s strict regarding function arguments. ¡	Although Kotlin isn’t lazy, you can use the by lazy construct combined with a   function to implement laziness.  ¡	With laziness, you can manipulate and compose infinite data structures. ¡	Right folds don’t cause stream evaluation; only some functions used for folding do. ¡	Using folds, you can compose several iterating operations without resulting in   multiple iterations.  ¡	You can easily define and compose infinite streams.   10More data handling with trees  In this chapter ¡	Understanding size, height, and depth in a tree   ¡	Understanding insertion order in the binary   structure  search tree  ¡	Traversing trees in various orders ¡	Implementing the binary search tree ¡	Merging, folding, and balancing trees  of   elements   accessing   In chapter 5, you learned about the singly linked list, which is probably the most widely used immutable data structure. Although the list is an efficient data structure for many operations, it has some limitations. The main shortcoming is that the com- plexity  elements. For example, searching for a particular element may necessitate examining all ele- ments if it happens that the searched-for element is the last in the list. Among other less efficient operations are sorting, accessing elements by their index, and finding the maximal or minimal element. For example, to find the maximal  or minimal  element in a list, one has to traverse the whole list. In this chapter, you’ll learn about a new data structure that solves these problems: the binary tree.  proportionally   number   grows   with   the   of   261                                       262  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  10.1  The binary tree  This chapter starts with some theory about binary trees. Some readers might think that  binary trees are a well-known subject that all programmers would master. If that’s you and  you’ve mastered binary trees, you can jump straight to the exercises, which will probably  seem easy. For the rest of you, be prepared for exercises that are slightly more difficult than  those in the previous chapters. If you can’t find the answer to an exercise, you can look at  the solution. But I recommend that you return to the exercise later and try again to solve  it. Remember, exercises generally build on previous ones, so if you don’t understand the  solution to one exercise, you’ll probably have difficulty solving the succeeding ones.  Data trees are structures in which, unlike in lists, each element is linked to more than  one element. In some trees, each element  sometimes called a node  can be linked to a  variable number of other elements. Most often, though, they’re linked to a fixed num- ber of elements. In binary trees, as the name suggests, each element is linked to two  elements. Those links are called branches. In binary trees, those branches are called the  left and right branches. Figure 10.1 shows an example of a binary tree.  The tree represented in the figure isn’t common because its elements are of differ- ent types. It’s a tree of Any. Most often, you’ll deal with trees of a more specific type, such  as trees of integers.  In figure 10.1, you can see that a tree is a recursive structure. Each branch leads to a new  tree  often called a subtree . You can also see that some branches lead to a single element.  This isn’t a problem because this single element is, in fact, a tree with empty branches.  Such terminal elements are often called leaves. Also note the T element: it has a left branch  but no right one. This is because the right branch is empty and is not represented. From  this, you can infer the definition of a binary tree. A tree is one of the following:  ¡	A single element such as 56.2, "hi", 42, and -2 in figure 10.1 ¡	An element with one branch  right or left  such as T in figure 10.1 ¡	An element with two branches  right and left , such as a, 1, or $  Left branch  1  Root  Right branch  a  $  56.2  “hi!”  56.2 T  –2  Subtree  Leaves  42  Leaves  Subtree  Figure 10.1    A binary tree is a  recursive structure composed of a  root and two branches. The left branch  is a link to the left subtree, and the  right branch is a link to the right  subtree. Terminal elements have empty  branches  not represented in the figure   and are called leaves.   Looking at size, height, and depth in trees     263  Each branch holds a  sub tree. A tree in which all elements have either two branches or  no branches is called a full tree. The tree in figure 10.1 isn’t full, but the left subtree is.  10.2  Understanding balanced and unbalanced trees  Binary trees can be more or less balanced. A perfectly balanced tree is a tree in which  the two branches of all subtrees contain the same number of elements. Figure 10.2  shows three examples of trees with the same elements. The first tree is perfectly bal- anced and the last tree is totally unbalanced. Perfectly balanced binary trees are some- times called perfect trees.  In this figure, the tree on the right is, in fact, a singly linked list. A singly linked list   can be seen as a special case of a totally unbalanced tree.  10.3  Looking at size, height, and depth in trees  A tree can be characterized by the number of elements it contains and the number of  levels on which these elements are spread:  ¡	The number of elements is called the size. ¡	The number of levels, not counting the root, is called the height.  In figure 10.2, all three trees have a size of 7. The first  perfectly balanced  tree has a  height of 2, the second  imperfectly balanced  has a height of 3, and the third  unbal- anced  a height of 6.  2  1  3  56.25  7  A perfectly balanced tree  4  2  6  6  5  3  4  1  7  An imperfectly balanced tree  1  2  7  3  6  5  64  A totally  unbalanced tree  Figure 10.2    Trees can be more or  less balanced. The top tree is perfectly  balanced because the two branches of  all subtrees contain the same number of  elements. The tree on the right is a singly  linked list, which is a special case of a  totally unbalanced tree.   264  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  The word height is also used to characterize individual elements. It refers to the  length of the longest path from an element to a leaf. The height of the root is the  height of the tree, and the height of an element is the height of the subtree having this  element as its root.  The depth of an element is the length of the path from the root to the element.  The first element, also called the root, has a depth of 0. In the perfectly balanced tree  in figure 10.2, elements 2 and 6 have a depth of 1, and elements 1, 3, 5, and 7 have a  depth of 2.  10.4  Empty trees and the recursive definition  In section 10.1, I said that a tree is composed of a root element with zero, one, or two  branches. This is a naive definition that doesn’t allow for all needed computations. In  particular, it doesn’t represent empty trees. We can, however, include empty trees by  changing the definition slightly. A tree is either  ¡	An empty tree ¡	A root element with two branches that are themselves trees  According  to  this  new  recursive  definition,  each  element  that  seems  to  have  no  branches in figure 10.2 has in fact two empty trees as its left and right branches. Ele- ments that appear as if they had a single branch have, in reality, an empty tree as their  second  branch.  By  convention,  empty  branches  are  not  represented  in  diagrams.  Another more important convention is that the height and depth of an empty tree are  equal to –1. You’ll see that this is necessary for some operations such as balancing.  10.5  Leafy trees  Binary trees are sometimes represented in a different way, as shown in figure 10.3. In  this representation, a tree is represented by branches that don’t hold values. Only the  terminal nodes hold values. As terminal nodes are called leaves, such trees are called  leafy trees.  The leafy tree representation is sometimes preferred because it makes implement- ing some functions easier. In this book, however, I’ll consider only classic trees, not  leafy trees.  Root  left  right  Branch  left  right  Branch  left  right  Leaf  1  Leaf  3  Leaf  5  Leaf  8  Figure 10.3    A leafy tree holds values only in the  terminal nodes, which are called leaves.   Ordered binary trees or binary search trees     265  10.6  Ordered binary trees or binary search trees  An ordered binary tree, also called a Binary Search Tree, or simply BST, has the following  traits:  ¡	It contains elements that can be ordered. ¡	All elements in one branch have a lower value than the root element. ¡	All elements in the other branch have a higher value than the root element. ¡	The same condition holds for all subtrees.  By convention, elements with lower values than the root are on the left branch, and  elements with higher values are on the right branch. Figure 10.4 shows an example of  an ordered tree.  NOTE    One important consequence of the definition of ordered binary trees is  that they can never contain duplicates.  Ordered trees are particularly interesting because they allow for fast retrieval of ele- ments. To find out whether an element is contained in the tree, you  1  Compare the searched-for element with the root. If those are equal, you’re done. 2  If the searched-for element has a lower value than the root, proceed recursively   3  If the searched-for element has a higher value than the root, proceed recursively   with the left branch.  with the right branch.  Compared to a search in a singly linked list, you can see that searching a perfectly bal- anced ordered binary tree takes an amount of time proportional to the height of the   Left branch is lower than corresponding root.  3  Right branch is higher than corresponding root.  1  8  0  2  6  10  Left branch is lower than corresponding root.  5  7  56.29  11  Right branch is higher than corresponding root.  Left branch is lower than corresponding root.       Figure 10.4 An example of an ordered or binary search tree. All elements in one branch  by convention, the left branch  have a lower value than the root element, and all elements in the other branch  by convention, the right branch  have a higher value than the root element. The same traits apply to all subtrees.         266  chapter    10  More data handling with trees  tree. This means that a search takes a time proportional to log2 n , with being the size  number of elements  of the tree. By contrast, the search time in a singly linked list is proportional to the number of elements.  n  A direct consequence of this is that a recursive search in a perfectly balanced binary tree never overflows the stack. As you saw in chapter 4, the standard stack size allows for 1,000 to 3,000 recursive steps. Because a perfectly balanced binary tree of height 1,000 contains 2^1,000 elements, you’ll never have enough main memory for such a tree.  This is good news. But the bad news is that not all binary trees are perfectly balanced. Because the totally unbalanced binary tree is a singly linked list, it has the same perfor- mance and the same problem regarding recursion as the list. This means that to get the most from trees, you have to find a way to balance them.  10.7   Insertion order and the structure of trees The order of its elements. Insertion is done in the same way as searching:  structure of a tree  meaning how well balanced it is  depends on the insertion  ¡  ¡  If the tree is empty, create a new tree with the element as the root and two empty trees as the left and right branches. If the tree is not empty, compare the element to be inserted with the root. If those are equal, you’re done. There’s nothing to insert because you can only insert an element lower or higher than the root.  Reality is sometimes different. If the objects inserted into the tree can be equal from the tree-ordering point of view but different based on other criteria, you’ll probably want to replace the root with the element you’re inserting. This is the most frequent case, as you’ll soon see:  ¡  ¡  If the element to be inserted is lower than the root, insert it recursively into the left branch. If the element to be inserted is higher than the root, insert it recursively into the right branch.  This process leads to an interesting observation: the balance of the tree depends on the order in which elements are inserted. It’s obvious that inserting ordered elements produces  pro- duce identical trees.

A set of ten elements can be inserted  Figure 10.5 into a tree in 3,628,800 distinct orders, but this only produces 16,796 distinct trees. These trees range from perfectly balanced to totally unbalanced. Ordered trees are efficient for storing and retrieving random data, but they’re not good at storing and retrieving pre-ordered data.    10.8  Recursive and non-recursive tree traversal order Given a specific tree as represented in figure 10.5, one common use case is to traverse it, visiting all elements one after the other. This is typically the case when mapping or folding  value. When you studied lists in chapter 5, you learned that there are two ways to traverse those: from left to right or from right to left. Trees offer many more approaches and among them we’ll make a distinction between recursive and non-recursive ones.  particular   searching   extent,   lesser   when   trees   and,   tree   the   for   to   a   a     10.8.1  Traversing recursive trees Consider the left branch of the tree in figure 10.5. This branch is itself a tree composed of the root 1, the left branch 0, and the right branch 2. You can traverse this tree in six orders:  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  1, 0, 2 1, 2, 0 0, 1, 2 2, 1, 0 0, 2, 1 2, 0, 1  You can see that three of these orders are symmetric with the other three: 1, 0, 2 and 1, 2, 0 are symmetric. You start from the root and then visit the two branches, from left to right or from right to left. The same holds for 0, 1, 2 and 2, 1, 0, which differ only in the order of the branches, and again for 0, 2, 1 and 2, 0, 1. Considering only the left to right direction  because the other direction is exactly the same, as if it were seen in a mirror , you’re left with three orders, which are named after the position of the root:  ¡  ¡  ¡  Pre-order  1, 0, 2 or 1, 2, 0  In-order  0, 1, 2 or 2, 1, 0  Post-order  0, 2, 1 or 2, 0, 1                                                                                    268  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  0  2  6  10  5  7  9  11  3  3  3  1  1  1  Depth-first Pre-order 3, 1, 0, 2, 8, 6, 5, 7, 10, 9, 11  Depth-first In-order 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11  Depth-first Post-order 0, 2, 1, 5, 7, 6, 9, 11, 10, 8, 3  8  8  8  0  2  6  10  5  7  9  11  0  2  6  10  5  7  9  11  Figure 10.6    Depth-first traversal consists in traversing the tree while giving priority to  height. This can be applied with three main orders: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.   Binary search tree implementation     269  These terms are coined after the operator position in an operation. To better see the  analogy, imagine the root  1  replaced with a plus  +  sign. This would give you  ¡	Prefix  +, 0, 2 or +, 2, 0  ¡	Infix  0, +, 2 or 2, +, 0  ¡	Postfix  0, 2, + or 2, 0, +   Applied recursively to the whole tree, these orders result in traversing the tree while  giving priority to height, leading to the traversal paths shown in figure 10.6. This type  of traversal is generally called depth first instead of the more logical height first. When  talking about the whole tree, height and depth refer to the height of the root and  depth of the deepest leaf as you learned in section 10.3. These two values are equal.  10.8.2  Non-recursive traversal orders  Another way to traverse a tree is to first visit a complete level and then go to the next  level. Again, this can be done from left to right or from right to left. This kind of traversal  is called level first.  When it relates to searching for an element rather than traversing the  tree, it is generally called breadth-first search.  One example of level-first traversal is shown  in figure 10.7.  10.9  Binary search tree implementation  You can implement a binary tree in the same way as a singly linked list, with a head   called  value  and two tails  the branches, called  left and  right . In this section,  you’ll define an abstract Tree class with two subclasses named T and Empty. T represents  a non-empty tree, whereas Empty, unsurprisingly, represents the empty tree.  As with the List, the empty tree can be represented by a singleton object, thanks to  the fact that Kotlin handles variance. This singleton object will be a Tree .  Listing 10.1 represents the minimal Tree implementation.  3  Level order 3, 1, 8, 0, 2, 6, 10, 5, 7, 9, 11  1  8  0  2  6  10  5  7  56.29  11  Figure 10.7 given level before going to the next level.

The Tree class is parameterized, and the  parameter type must extend Comparable.  sealed class Tree > {       abstract fun isEmpty  : Boolean      internal object Empty : Tree    {           override fun isEmpty  : Boolean = true          override fun toString  : String = "E"      }  The empty tree is represented  by a singleton object  parameterized with Nothing.  All properties are internal so  that they can’t be accessed  directly from other modules.      internal class T >                             internal val left: Tree ,  The T subclass represents                             internal val value: A, a non-empty tree.                            internal val right: Tree   : Tree    {          override fun isEmpty  : Boolean = false          override fun toString  : String =                     " T $left $value $right "      }      companion object {          operator fun  > invoke  : Tree  =                                         Empty      } }  The invoke function returns  the Empty singleton.  The toString functions are minimal  implementations to help see the content of a tree.  This class is quite simple, but it’s useless as long as you have no way to construct a real  tree. But before adding this, there’s a problem you must take into consideration.  10.9.1  Understanding variance and trees  In chapter 5, you learned how variance can be applied to lists. Variance also applies  to trees. Making a tree covariant on its parameter seems to make sense. After all, a  Tree  should also be usable where a Tree  is expected. This is what you  get by making the tree covariant through the use of the out keyword. On the other  hand, you shouldn’t be able to add a Number to a Tree . If this was possible, the  Tree class would be contravariant on its type parameter.   Binary search tree implementation     271  The problem comes from the fact that the Tree type parameter must implement the  Comparable interface. This isn’t the Java Comparable interface, but a specific Kotlin one: public interface Comparable  {     public operator fun compareTo other: T : Int }  As you can see, Comparable is contravariant on T, meaning that the type parameter T  occurs only in the in position. This would normally make it impossible to make the  Tree class covariant. You could deal with this, but it would force you to explicitly cast  the Empty singleton object in a Tree  each time you needed to use it. You’d still be  able to make this cast into a function such as operator fun  > invoke   = Empty as Tree   You’d then get a warning from the compiler about the unchecked cast. Which solution  to use is up to you, but the use of @UnsafeVariance is cleaner and, as it allows making  Tree covariant, it’s also more useful.  Now you need a way to construct trees by adding elements to an existing tree, start-  ing with the empty one. exercise 10.1 Define  a  plus  function  to  insert  a  value  into  a  tree.  As  usual,  the  Tree  structure  is  immutable and persistent, so a new tree with the added value must be constructed,  leaving the original tree untouched. Calling this function plus lets you use the + oper- ator to add an element to a tree. hint If the element to add is equal to the root, you must return a new tree with the inserted  value as the root and leave the two original branches unchanged. Otherwise, a value  lower than the root should be added to the left branch, and a value higher than the  root should be added to the right branch. You should create a function in the parent  Tree class with the following signature: operator fun plus element: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree   If you prefer to define an abstract function in the Tree parent class and implement it in  each subclass, well ... just try. soLution The function uses pattern matching to select an implementation based on the type of  this tree. If it’s Empty, it returns a new T  the non-empty tree  constructed from the  element to add as the value and two empty trees as the branches. If the parameter tree  is non-empty, three cases are possible:  ¡	The element to add is lower than the root. In this case, a new tree is constructed with  the same root and the same right branch, and the new left branch is the result of  inserting the element in the original left branch.   272  chapter    10  More data handling with trees  ¡  ¡  The element to add is higher than the root. In this case, a new tree is constructed with the same root and the same left branch, and the new right branch is the result of inserting the element in the original right branch. The element to add is equal to the root. constructed with the element to add as the root and the two original branches:  In this case, the function returns a new tree  operator fun plus element: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree  = when  this  {  Empty -> T Empty, element, Empty  is T -> when {  element   T left + element, this.value, right  element > this.value -> T left, this.value, right + element  else -> T this.left, element, this.right   }  }  This is different from what happens in many implementations  the Java TreeSet, for example  that are unchanged if you try to insert an element that’s equal to an element already in the set. Although this behavior might be acceptable for mutable elements, it’s much less acceptable when elements are immutable. You might think it’s a waste of with the same left branch, the time and memory space to construct a new instance of same right branch, and a root equal to the current root because you could return this. Returning T this.left, this.value, this.right   would be equivalent to returning  this  T  If this is what you intended, returning the original tree would be a good optimization. This would work, but it would be tedious to obtain the same result as mutating a tree element. You’d have to remove the element before inserting an equal element with some changed properties. You’ll encounter this use case when implementing a map in chapter 11.  10.9.2   an abstract function in the  What about an abstract function in the Tree class? Defining parent class with different implementations in each subclass might be seen as a better option by object-oriented programmers. But it won’t work. Here’s what the implementation in the override fun  > plus element: Nothing : Tree  =  object would look like:  Empty  Tree  T Empty, element, Empty   element  Empty   always fails because element  This doesn’t work because using the T Empty, can’t be instantiated. Although you element,  know that Nothing, you can’t specify the type because type param- eters aren’t allowed for objects. For this reason, you need to define the function in the A, Tree and no problem arises.  class using pattern matching. In the  case, the parameter is still of type  parameter of type  isn’t of type  Nothing  Nothing  Empty   in     10.9.3   Overloading operators Kotlin function val tree = Tree    + 5 + 2 + 8  allows operator overloading. By using the    operator  keyword and naming the  plus, you’re able to call the operator using the  +  sign:                                                                                                             Binary search tree implementation     273  There’s no way to avoid specifying the argument type, even if it’s indicated on the left  of the equal sign. This won’t compile: val tree: Tree  = Tree   + 5 + 2 + 8  10.9.4  Recursion in trees  You  may  be  wondering  whether  you  should  implement  stack-safe  recursion  for  the  helper function because the plus function is recursive. As I said previously, there’s no  need to do so with a balanced tree because the height  which determines the maxi- mum number of recursion steps  is generally much lower than the size. But you’ve seen  that this isn’t always the case, particularly if the elements to be inserted are ordered.  This could eventually result in a tree with only one branch, which would have its height  equal to its size  minus one  and would overflow the stack.  For now, though, you don’t need to deal with this. Rather than implementing stack- safe recursive operations, you’ll find a way to automatically balance trees. The sim- ple tree you’re working on is only for learning. It’ll never be used in production. But  balanced trees are more complex to implement, so it’s easier to start with the simple  unbalanced tree. exercise 10.2 It’s often useful to build a tree from some other type of collection. The two most useful  cases are building a tree from a List and building a tree from an array. Implement one  function for each of these cases. Use the List type you defined in previous chapters,  not the Kotlin List type. soLution The solution using a vararg is similar to what you used for List: operator fun  > invoke vararg az: A : Tree  =     az.foldRight Empty, { a: A, tree: Tree  -> tree.plus a  }   To do the same thing for a Kotlin list, you need to change the type of the argument  without changing anything in the implementation: operator fun  > invoke az: List  : Tree  =     az.foldRight Empty, { a: A, tree: Tree  -> tree.plus a  }   The List type you defined in chapters 5 and 8 has, from this point of view, a slight  difference: the foldRight function is curried and, furthermore, the List.foldRight  function isn’t stack-safe. In this case, it’s much better to use foldLeft: operator fun  > invoke list: List  : Tree  =     list.foldLeft Empty as Tree , { tree: Tree  ->         { a: A ->             tree.plus a          }     }   Using foldLeft and foldRight produces different trees because the order of inser- tion of the elements won’t be the same.   274  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  exercise 10.3 One operation often used on trees consists of checking whether a specific element is  present in the tree. Implement a contains function that performs this check. Here’s  its signature: fun contains a: @UnsafeVariance A : Boolean  soLution What you need to do is compare the parameter with the tree value  the value at the  root of the tree :  ¡	If the parameter is lower, recursively apply the comparison to the left branch. ¡	If it’s higher, recursively apply the comparison to the right branch. ¡	If the value and the parameter are equal, return true.  As usual, you’d define this function in the Tree class, using the @UnsafeVariance anno- tation on the parameter in order to disable variance checking: fun contains a: @UnsafeVariance A : Boolean = when  this  {     is Empty -> false     is T -> when {         a   left.contains a          a > value -> right.contains a          else -> value == a     } }  You might also have solved the exercise with an implementation like this: fun  > contains a: A : Boolean =     when  this  {         is Empty -> false         is T -> a == value  left.contains a   right.contains a      }  This  is  simpler  and  perfectly  correct,  although  slightly  slower  if  the  search  implies  recursively  looking  at  the  right  branch.  But  there’s  another  more  important  differ- ence: this implementation allows testing for elements of a different type than the ele- ment of the tree. This is because the A type parameter of this implementation is not  the A parameter of the Tree class. It’s shadowing the Tree type parameter. This is much  clearer if you rename the parameter: fun  > contains b: B : Boolean =     when  this  {         is Empty -> false         is T -> b == value  left.contains b   right.contains b      }  With this implementation, you can write something like Tree 1, 2, 3 .contains1 "2"   without causing a compile error. Whether this is better or not is up to you.   Binary search tree implementation     275  size  and  height  of a tree. Here are their possible  10.4  exercise Write two functions to compute the class: signatures in the abstract fun size  : Int abstract fun height  : Int  Tree  Empty  implementation   You should try to find a better solution as you did for list length in chapter 8. soLution The implementation of the function in the the import kotlin.math.max    Empty   size class returns 1 plus the size of each branch. The implementation of  size function returns –1. The implementation of the  function returns 1 plus the maximum  of the two branches:  of   height  previously,   returns   height  height  And   said   the  as   0.   I   T  ...  override fun size  : Int = 1 + left.size   + right.size   override fun height  : Int = 1 + max left.height  , right.height     Based on this, you can see why the height of an empty tree needs to be equal to –1. If it were 0, the height would be equal to the number of elements in the path instead of the number of segments.  But these functions are inefficient. First of all, the length and the height are computed on each call. These results should be memoized. But the worst thing is that these func- tions could cause a if the tree is huge and not well balanced. A   StackOverflowException much better solution is to create two abstract properties in the abstract val size: Int  parent class:  Tree  abstract val height: Int  Then you can implement these properties in each subclass: internal object Empty : Tree    {  override val size: Int = 0  override val height: Int = -1  ...  }  ...  }  internal class T  override val left: Tree ,  override val value: A, override val right: Tree   : Tree    {  override val size: Int = 1 + left.size + right.size  override val height: Int = 1 + max left.height, right.height                                                                                            276  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  Remember  that  creating  public  properties  by  default  automatically  creates  accessor  functions. The only particularities are that these functions have the same name as the  property, and the getter doesn’t use parentheses. exercise 10.5 Write max and min functions to compute the maximum and minimum values contained  in a tree. hint Think of what the functions should return in the Empty class. soLution In an empty tree, there are no minimum or maximum values. The solution is to return  a Result  and the Empty implementations should return Result.empty  .  The implementation for the T class is a bit tricky. For the max function, the solution  is to return the max of the right branch. If the right branch isn’t empty, this’ll be a recur- sive call. If the right branch is empty, you’ll get a Result.Empty. You then know that the  max value is the value of the current tree, so you can call the orElse function on the  return value of the right.max   function: override fun max  : Result  = right.max  .orElse { Result value  }  Recall that the orElse function evaluates its argument lazily, which means it takes a   {    → Result > } but the    → part can be omitted. The min function is completely  symmetrical: override fun min  : Result  = left.min  .orElse { Result value  }  Unlike singly linked lists, trees allow retrieving a specific element, as you saw when you  developed the contains function in exercise 10.3. This should also make it possible to  remove a specific element from a tree. exercise 10.6 Write a remove function that removes an element from a tree. This function will take  an element as its parameter. If this element is present in the tree, it’ll be removed and  the function will return a new tree without this element. This new tree will respect the  requirements that all elements on a left branch must be lower than the root, and all  elements on the right branch must be higher than the root. If the element isn’t in the  tree, the function will return the tree unchanged. The function signature will be Tree  remove A a   hint You’ll need to define a function to merge two trees with the particularity that all ele- ments of one are either greater or smaller than all elements of the other. Be sure to  handle variance as needed.  10.9.5  Removing elements from trees   Binary search tree implementation     277  soLution When the tree is  Empty, the function can’t remove anything and will return  this.  Otherwise, here’s the algorithm you’ll need to implement:  ¡	If a < this.value, remove from left. ¡	If a > this.value, remove from right. ¡	Else,  merge  the  left  and  right  branches,  discarding  the  root,  and  return  the   result.  The merge is a simplified merge because you know that all elements in the left branch  are lower than all elements of the right branch. First you must define the merge func- tion with the following signature:  fun removeMerge ta: Tree  : Tree   This time, if this tree is empty, the function returns its parameter. Otherwise, the fol- lowing algorithm is used:  ¡	If ta is empty, return this  this can’t be empty . ¡	If ta.value < this.value, merge ta in the left branch. ¡	If ta.value > this.value, merge ta in the right branch.  Here’s the implementation: fun removeMerge ta: Tree  : Tree  = when  this  {     Empty -> ta     is T  -> when  ta  {         Empty -> this         is T -> when {             ta.value   T left.removeMerge ta , value, right              else             -> T left, value, right.removeMerge ta            }     } }  Notice that the roots of the two trees can’t be equal because the two trees to be merged  are supposed to be the left and right branches of the original tree. Now you can write  the remove function: fun remove a: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree  = when this  {     Empty -> this     is T  ->  when {         a   T left.remove a , value, right          a > value -> T left, value, right.remove a           else -> left.removeMerge right      } }   278  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  10.9.6  Merging arbitrary trees  In the previous section, you used a restricted merging function that could only merge  trees if all values in one tree were lower than all values of the other tree. Merging for  trees is the equivalent of concatenation for lists. You need a more general function to  handle merging of arbitrary trees. exercise 10.7  hard  So far you’ve only merged trees in which all elements in one tree were greater than  all  elements  of  the  other.  Write  a  merge  function  that  merges  arbitrary  trees.  Its   signature is abstract fun merge tree: Tree  : Tree   soLution The Empty implementation returns its parameter: override fun merge tree: Tree  : Tree  = tree  The T subclass implementation uses the following algorithm, in which “this” means  the tree in which the function is defined:  ¡	If the parameter tree is empty, return this. ¡	If the root of the parameter is higher than this root, remove the left branch of  the parameter tree and merge the result with this right branch. Then merge the  result with the parameter’s left branch.  ¡	If the root of the parameter is lower than this root, remove the right branch of  the parameter tree and merge the result with this left branch. Then merge the  result with the parameter’s right branch.  ¡	If the root of the parameter is equal to this root, merge the left branch of the  parameter with this left branch and merge the right branch of the parameter  with this right branch.  Here’s the T subclass implementation: override fun merge tree: Tree  : Tree  = when  tree  {     Empty -> this     is T ->   when  {         tree.value > this.value ->           T left, value, right.merge T Empty, tree.value, tree.right                    .merge tree.left          tree.value             T left.merge T tree.left, tree.value, Empty  , value, right                  .merge tree.right          else                    ->           T left.merge tree.left , value, right.merge tree.right       } }   Binary search tree implementation     279  With this implementation, the root of the tree won’t be substituted with the root of  the parameter tree if both roots are equals. This may or may not correspond to your  requirements. If you want the merged root to replace the initial root, change the last  line of the implementation to this: T left.merge tree.left , tree.value, right.merge tree.right    This  algorithm  is  illustrated  by  figures  10.8  through  10.17.  In  these  figures,  empty  branches are explicitly represented. As a reminder, “this” means the tree in which the  function is defined.  0  2  4  6  1  4  6  8  E  E  56.2E  E  E  E  56.2E  E  E  E  56.2E  E  E  E  56.2E  E  Figure 10.8    The two trees to be merged.

On the other hand, the height of the result is higher than you might expect. Merg- ing two trees of height 3 can give a resulting tree of height 5. It’s easy to see that the  optimal height shouldn’t be higher than log2 size . The optimal height is the smallest  power of two higher than the resulting size. In this example, the sizes of the two original  trees were 7 and their heights were 3. The size of the merged tree is 9, and the optimal  height would be 4 instead of 5. In such a small example, this might not be an issue. But  when you’re merging big trees, you could end up with badly balanced trees, resulting  in suboptimal performance, and even possibly a stack overflow when using recursive  functions.  10.10  About folding trees  Folding a tree is similar to folding a list; it consists of transforming a tree into a single  value. For example, in a tree of numerical values, computing the sum of all elements  can be represented through a fold. But folding a tree is much more complicated than  folding a list.   284  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  Computing the sum of the elements in a tree of integers is trivial because the addi- tion is associative in both directions and commutative. The following expressions have  the same values:  *    1 + 3  + 2  +   5 + 7  + 6   + 4  * 4 +   2 +  1 + 3   +  6 +  5 + 7     *    7 + 5  + 6  +   3 + 1  + 2   + 4  * 4 +   6 +  7 + 5   +  2 +  3 + 1     *  1 + 2 + 3   +  4 +  5 +  6 +  7      *  7 +  6 + 5   +  4 +  3 +  2 + 1     Examining these expressions, you can see that they represent some possible results of  folding the following tree using addition:      4       \        \   2     6    \     \ 1   3 5   7  Considering only the order in which the elements are processed, you can recognize  the following:  ¡	Post-order left ¡	Pre-order left ¡	Post-order right ¡	Pre-order right ¡	In-order left ¡	In-order right  Left and right mean starting from the left and starting from the right, respectively.  You can verify this by computing the result for each expression. For example, the first  expression can be reduced as follows:     1 + 3  + 2  +   5 + 7  + 6   + 4      4    + 2   +   5 + 7  + 6   + 4  used: 1, 3          6       +   5 + 7  + 6   + 4  used: 1, 3, 2          6       +     12   +  6   + 4  used: 1, 3, 2, 5, 7          6       +         18       + 4  used: 1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 6 used: 1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 6 24               + 4  28  used: 1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 6, 4  possibilities   Other  are equivalent for addition, they may not be for other operations, such as adding charac- ters to strings or adding elements to lists.  interesting.

You can fold each branch with the given operation, but you need a way to combine the two results into one.                                      About folding trees     285  A  B  to  B, you need an additional function from  Does this remind you of list-folding parallelization you learned in chapter 8? Yes, you need an additional operation.

The subclass implementation is a bit more difficult. What you need to do is recursively compute the fold for each branch and then combine the results with the root. The problem is that each branch fold returns a A, and you’ve no function from  at your disposal. The solution to this might be as follows:  subclass is straightforward.

If you fold a tree with an operation that’s commutative, like addition, the result won’t change. But if you use an operation that isn’t commutative, you’re in trouble. The end result is that the two solutions will give you different results. For example, this function fun main args: Array   {  val result = Tree 4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7   .foldLeft List  ,  { list: List  -> { a: Int -> list.cons a  } }   { x -> { y -> y.concat x  } }  println result   }  produces the following result with the first solution [7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, NIL]                                                                                                                                   286  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  and the following result with the second solution: [7, 5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2, NIL]  Which is the right result? In fact, both lists, although in different orders, represent the  same tree. Figure 10.18 represents the two cases.  This isn’t the same difference as foldLeft and foldRight for the List class. Folding  from right to left is in fact a left fold of the reversed list. A right fold would look like override fun   foldRight identity: B, f:  A  ->  B  -> B, g:  B  ->  B  -> B : B =        g f this.value  left.foldRight identity, f, g    right                                                 .foldRight identity, f, g    Because  there  are  many  traversal  orders,  there  are  many  possible  implementations  that give different results with non-commutative operations.  10.10.2  Folding with a single function  It’s also possible to fold with a single function taking an additional parameter, which  means, for example, a function from B to A to B to B. Once again, there’ll be many pos- sible implementations, depending on the traversal order. exercise 10.9 Write three functions to fold a tree: foldInOrder, foldPreOrder, and foldPostOrder.  Applied to the tree in figure 10.18, the elements should be processed as follows:  ¡	In-order: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ¡	Pre-order: 4 2 1 3 6 5 7 ¡	Post-order: 1 3 2 5 7 6 4  Here are the function signatures: abstract fun   foldInOrder identity: B, f:  B  ->  A  ->  B  -> B : B abstract fun   foldPreOrder identity: B, f:  A  ->  B  ->  B  -> B : B abstract fun   foldPostOrder identity: B, f:  B  ->  B  ->  A  -> B : B  4  4  2  6  2  6  1  3  5  7  1  3  5  7  Figure 10.18 in different orders, they represent the same tree.

To  There’s a relationship between the way a data structure is folded and the way it’s constructed. You can construct a data structure by starting with an empty element and adding elements one by one. This is the reverse of folding. Ideally, you should be able to fold a structure using specific parameters, allowing you to turn the fold into an identity function. For a list, this would be as follows: list.foldRight List    { i -> { l -> l.cons i  } }  You could also use list.foldLeft List    { l -> { i -> l.reverse  .cons i .reverse   } }  foldLeft, but the function would be slightly more complex:  This isn’t surprising, if you look at the implemented using  foldLeft  and  reverse.  foldRight  implementation.  foldRight  could be  Can you do the same with tree folding? To achieve this, you’ll need a new way to build trees by assembling a left tree, a root, and a right tree.

Now you can fold a tree and obtain the same tree as the                                                                               10.11  About mapping trees     289  original one  provided you use the correct function .

The trick is to first transform the tree into a list as shown in this exam- ple of    abstract in Tree and this implementation in T:  foldLeft:  override fun   foldLeft identity: B, f:  B  ->  A  -> B : B =  toListPreOrderLeft  .foldLeft identity, f      In Tree: override fun toListPreOrderLeft  : List  =  left.toListPreOrderLeft  .concat right.toListPreOrderLeft   .cons value   This might not be the fastest implementation, but it could still be useful.  x  x  *  10.11 map  About mapping trees Like lists, trees can be mapped, but mapping functions to trees is a bit more compli- cated than mapping functions to lists. Applying a function to each element of a tree may seem trivial, but it’s not. The problem is that not all functions preserve ordering. Adding a given value to all elements of a tree of integers will be fine, but using the function f x  = will be much more complicated if the tree contains negative values because applying the function in place won’t result in a binary search tree. exercise Define a function for trees. Try to preserve the tree structure if possible. For exam- ple, mapping a tree of integers by squaring values might produce a tree with a different structure, but mapping by adding a constant shouldn’t. hint Using one of the fold functions makes it straightforward. soLution You have several possible implementations using the various fold functions. Here’s an example that can be defined in the fun  > map f:  A  -> B : Tree  =  class:  Tree  foldInOrder Empty  { t1: Tree  ->  { i: A ->  { t2: Tree  ->  Tree t1, f i , t2   }  }  }                                             290  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  10.12  About balancing trees  As I said earlier, trees work well if they’re balanced, which means that all paths from  the root to a leaf element have nearly the same length. In a perfectly balanced tree, the  difference in lengths won’t exceed 1, which happens if the deeper level isn’t full.  Only  perfectly balanced trees of size 2^n + 1 have all paths from the root to a leaf element of  the same length.   Using unbalanced trees can lead to bad performance because operations could need  time proportional to the size of the tree instead of to log2 size . More dramatically,  unbalanced trees can cause a stack overflow when using recursive operations. Here are  two ways to avoid this problem:  ¡	Balance the unbalanced trees ¡	Use self-balancing trees  Once you have a way to balance trees, it’s easy to make trees self-balancing by auto- matically launching the balancing process after each operation that could potentially  change the tree structure.  Before you can balance trees, you need to know how to incrementally change the struc- ture of a tree. The technique used is called rotating the tree, and it’s illustrated in fig- ures 10.19 and 10.20. exercise 10.12 Write rotateRight and rotateLeft functions to rotate a tree in both directions. Be  careful to preserve the branch order: left elements must always be lower than the root,  and right elements must always be higher than the root. Declare abstract functions in  the parent class. Make them protected, as they’ll only be used from inside the Tree  class. Here are the signatures in the parent class: protected abstract fun rotateRight  : Tree  protected abstract fun rotateLeft  : Tree   10.12.1  Rotating trees  Rotate right  4  2  2  6  1  4  1  3  56.25  7  3  6  5  7  Figure 10.19    Rotating a tree to the right.

Compare the code with the figures 10.19 and 10.20 to see what’s happening. If you try to rotate a tree several times, you’ll arrive at a point where one branch is empty and the tree can’t be rotated any longer in the same direction. exercise To balance the tree, you’ll also need functions to transform a tree into an ordered list. Write a function to change a tree into an in-order list from right to left  which means in descending order .  10.13                                                                 292  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  NOTE    If you want to try more exercises, don’t hesitate to define a function for  in-order left to right, as well as functions for pre-order and post-order.  Here’s the signature for the toListInOrderRight function: fun toListInOrderRight  : List   soLution This is simple and is more related to lists than to trees. Empty implementations return  an empty list. You might think of the following implementation  in the T class : override fun toListInOrderRight  : List  =         right.toListInOrderRight                .concat List value                .concat left.toListInOrderRight     Unfortunately, this function overflows the stack if the tree is badly balanced. As you need  this function to balance a tree, it’d be sad if it couldn’t work with an unbalanced tree.  What  you  need  is  a  stack-safe  corecursive  version.  This  uses  a  corecursive  helper  function for balancing the tree, which can be put in the companion object, with the  main function in the Tree class. Here’s the helper function: private tailrec fun  > unBalanceRight acc: List ,                                       tree: Tree  : List  =     when  tree  {         Empty -> acc         is T -> when  tree.left  {             Empty -> unBalanceRight acc.cons tree.value ,                                 tree.right               is T -> unBalanceRight acc,                                 tree.rotateRight             }     }  Rotates the tree until  the left branch is empty  Adds the tree to the  accumulator list.  And here’s the main function in the Tree class: fun toListInOrderRight  : List  = unBalanceRight List  , this   The  unBalancedRight function rotates the tree to the right until the left branch is  empty. Then it calls itself recursively to do the same thing to all the right subtrees, after  having added the tree value to the accumulator list. Eventually the tree parameter is  found empty and the function returns the list accumulator.  10.12.2  Using the Day-Stout-Warren algorithm  The Day-Stout-Warren algorithm is a simple method for efficiently balancing binary  search trees:  1  Transform the tree into a totally unbalanced tree. 2  Then apply rotations until the tree is fully balanced.   About balancing trees     293  Transforming the tree into a totally unbalanced one is a simple matter of making an in-order list and creating a new tree from it. As you want to create the tree in ascending order, you’ll have to create a list in descending order and then start to rotate the result left. You can choose the symmetric case.  Here’s the algorithm for obtaining a fully balanced tree:  1     2       3  Rotate the tree left until the result has branches as equal as possible. This means that the branch sizes will be equal if the total size is odd, and will differ by 1 if the total size is even. The result will be a tree with two totally unbalanced branches of near to equal size. Apply the same process recursively to the right branch. Apply the symmetric pro- cess  rotating right  to the left branch. Stop when the height of the result is equal to log2 size . For this you’ll need the following helper function:  fun log2nlz n: Int : Int = when  n  {  0 -> 0 else -> 31 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros n   }  Here’s what the Javadoc for the  numberOfLeadingZeros  method says:  Returns the number of zero bits preceding the highest-order  “leftmost”  one-bit in the two’s value. Returns 32 if the specified value complement binary representation of the specified has no one-bits in its two’s complement representation, in other words if it is equal to zero.  int  This method is closely related to the logarithm base 2. For all positive  int  values x:  ¡ ¡  floor log2 x   = 31 - numberOfLeadingZeros x  ceil log2 x   = 32 - numberOfLeadingZeros x - 1   balance    function to fully balance any tree. This function will be defined  exercise 10.14 Implement the in the companion object and will take as its parameter the tree to be balanced. hint This implementation is based on several helper functions: a front function creates the totally unbalanced tree by calling the function. The resulting list is folded left into a  totally unbalanced  tree, which will then be easier to balance.  toListInOrderRight  You’ll also need a function to test whether a tree is fully balanced or not, and one to recursively rotate a tree. Here’s how you might want to implement the function for rotating a tree in the companion object: fun   unfold a: A, f:  A  -> Result  : A {  tailrec fun   unfold a: Pair , Result >,  f:  A  -> Result  : Pair , Result > {  val x = a.second.flatMap { f it  } return x.map { unfold Pair a.second, x , f  }.getOrElse a   } return Result a .let { unfold Pair it, it , f .second.getOrElse a  }  }                                                                 294  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  Unfortunately, this won’t work because the helper function isn’t tail-recursive. To make  it tail-recursive, you need a way to determine whether a Result is a Success. You could  determine this in one of two ways:  ¡	By using pattern matching, provided the Result class and the Tree class are in   the same module  because Result subclasses are internal   ¡	By adding an isSuccess function in the Result class  Choose the solution you prefer. I have copied the Result class into this chapter mod- ule  along with other necessary classes . A working implementation could be fun   unfold a: A, f:  A  -> Result  : A {   tailrec fun   unfold a: Pair , Result >,                            f:  A  -> Result  : Pair , Result > {     val x = a.second.flatMap { f it  }     return when  x  {         is Result.Success -> unfold Pair a.second, x , f          else -> a     }   }   return Result a .let { unfold Pair it, it , f .second.getOrElse a  } }  This function is called unfold by analogy to List.unfold or Stream.unfold. It does  the same job, except that the result type of the function is the same as its input type,  but it forgets most of the results, keeping only the two last ones. This makes it faster  and  it  uses  less  memory.  You’ll  also  need  to  define  internal  functions  to  access  the  value and branches of a tree. soLution First, you need to define the utility function that tests whether a tree is unbalanced. For  it to be balanced, the difference between the heights of both branches must be 0 if the  total size of branches is even, and 1 if the size is odd: fun  > isUnBalanced tree: Tree  : Boolean =     when  tree  {         Empty -> false         is T -> Math.abs tree.left.height - tree.right.height  >                                                  tree.size - 1  % 2     }  Then you must create functions to access the value and the branches in a tree. You can  do this by using the same technique you used for the height and size. Define abstract  properties in the Tree class: internal abstract val value: A  internal abstract val left: Tree   internal abstract val right: Tree    About balancing trees     295  The Empty implementations throws an exception when accessed. That’s because you’re  defining properties and not functions. You can’t write override val value: Nothing =     throw IllegalStateException "No value in Empty"  override val left: Tree  =     throw IllegalStateException "No left in Empty"  override val right: Tree  =     throw IllegalStateException "No right in Empty"   Doing so will cause the exception to be thrown as soon as the properties are initialized,  meaning as soon as the object is created. If you remember what you’ve learned in chap- ter 9, you know you must use lazy initialization: override val value: Nothing by lazy {     throw IllegalStateException "No value in Empty"  } override val left: Tree  by lazy {     throw IllegalStateException "No left in Empty"  } override val right: Tree  by lazy {     throw IllegalStateException "No right in Empty"  }  NOTE    It’s your responsibility to make sure that these functions are never called.  In the T class, you need to modify the constructor: internal class T > override val left: Tree ,                                               override val value: A,                                               override val right: Tree  :                                                                 Tree    {  By overriding the properties in the constructor, you’re automatically giving them the  same visibility  internal  as the overridden properties, and not the default  public   visibility. Now you can write the main balancing functions: fun  > balance tree: Tree  : Tree  =         balanceHelper tree.toListInOrderRight  .foldLeft Empty  {                 t: Tree  -> { a: A ->                 T Empty, a, t              }         }   fun  > balanceHelper tree: Tree  : Tree  = when {     !tree.isEmpty   && tree.height > log2nlz tree.size  -> when {         Math.abs tree.left.height - tree.right.height  > 1 ->                                      balanceHelper balanceFirstLevel tree           else -> T balanceHelper tree.left ,                                      tree.value, balanceHelper tree.right       }     else -> tree }   296  chapter 10  More data handling with trees  private fun  > balanceFirstLevel tree: Tree  : Tree  =         unfold tree  { t: Tree  ->             when {                 isUnBalanced t  -> when {                     tree.right.height > tree.left.height ->                                                      Result t.rotateLeft                        else -> Result t.rotateRight                    }                 else -> Result               } }  10.12.3  Automatically balancing trees  The balance function works fine for most trees, but you can’t use it with big unbalanced  trees because those overflow the stack. You can work around this by using balance only  on small, fully unbalanced trees or on partially balanced trees of any size. This means  that you must balance a tree before it becomes too big. The question is whether you can  make the balancing automatic after each modification. exercise 10.15 Transform the tree you’ve developed to make it auto-balancing on insertions, merges,  and removals. soLution The obvious solution is to call balance after each operation that modifies the tree as in  the following code: operator fun plus a: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree  =                                 balance plusUnBalanced a    private fun plusUnBalanced a: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree  = plus this, a   This works for small trees  that, in fact, don’t need to be balanced , but it won’t work  for  large  ones  because  it’s  much  too  slow.  One  solution  is  to  only  partially  balance  trees. For example, you could run the balancing function only when the height is 100  times the ideal height of a fully balanced tree: operator fun plus a: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree  {    fun plusUnBalanced a: @UnsafeVariance A, t: Tree  : Tree  =     when  t  {       Empty -> T Empty, a, Empty        is T -> when {         a   T plusUnBalanced a, t.left , t.value, t.right          a > t.value -> T t.left, t.value, plusUnBalanced a, t.right           else        -> T t.left, a, t.right        }     }    return plusUnBalanced a, this .let {     when {       it.height > log2nlz it.size  * 100 -> balance it       297        else     -> it     }   } }  The performance of the balancing solution may seem far from optimal, but it’s a com- promise. Creating a tree from an ordered list of 100,000 elements would take 2.5 sec- onds and produce a perfectly balanced tree of height 16. Replacing the value 100 with  20 in the plusUnBalanced function doubles the time with no benefit, and replacing it  with 1,000 multiplies the time by 5.  Summary  ¡	Trees are recursive data structures in which one element is linked to one or several  subtrees. In some trees, each node can be linked to a variable number of subtrees.  Most often, though, those are linked to a fixed number of subtrees.  ¡	In  binary  trees,  each  node  is  linked  to  two  subtrees.  Those  links  are  called  branches, and those branches are called the left and right branches. Binary search  trees allow much faster retrieval of comparable elements.  ¡	Trees can be more or less balanced. Fully balanced trees provide the best perfor-  mance, whereas totally unbalanced trees have the same performance as lists.  ¡	The size of a tree is the number of elements it contains; its height is the longest   path in the tree.  ¡	The tree structure depends on the order of insertion of the tree elements. ¡	Trees can be traversed in many different orders  pre-order, in-order, post-order ,   and in both directions  left to right or right to left . ¡	Trees can be easily merged without traversing them. ¡	Trees can be mapped or rotated, as well as folded in many ways. ¡	Trees can be balanced for better performance and to avoid stack overflow in   recursive operations.   11Solving problems   with advanced trees  In this chapter ¡	Avoiding stack overflow with self-balancing trees ¡	Implementing the red-black tree ¡	Implementing maps ¡	Implementing priority queues  In the previous chapter, you learned about the binary tree structure and basic tree operations. But you saw that to fully benefit from trees, you must either have specific use cases, such as handling randomly ordered data, or a limited data set in order to avoid any risk of stack overflows. Making trees stack-safe is much more difficult than it was for lists because each computing step involves two recursive calls. That makes it impossible to create tail-recursive versions. In this chapter, you’ll learn about two specific trees:  ¡  ¡  The red-black tree is a self-balancing, general-purpose tree with high perfor- mance. It’s suitable for general use and data sets of any size. The leftist heap is a specific tree suitable for implementing priority queues.  You’ll also learn how to implement maps using trees storing key values tuples. And you’ll see how to create priority queues for noncomparable elements.  298                        299  Better performance and stack safety with self-balancing trees   11 11.1  Better performance and stack safety    with self-balancing trees The Day-Stout-Warren balancing algorithm that you used in the previous chapter isn’t  ideally suited for balancing immutable trees because it’s designed for in-place modi- fications. In order to write safer programs, in-place modifications must be avoided as  often as possible.  With immutable data structures, a new structure is created for each change. Conse- quently, you need to define a balancing process that doesn’t involve transforming the  tree into a list before reconstructing a totally unbalanced tree and then finally balanc- ing it. Two ways to optimize this process are to  You could try to invent a solution, but others have long since done that. One of the most  efficient self-balancing tree designs is the red-black tree. This structure was invented in  1978 by Guibas and Sedgewick.1 In 1999, Chris Okasaki published a functional version  of the red-black tree algorithm.2 The description was illustrated by an implementation  in Standard ML and a Haskell implementation was added later. It’s this algorithm that  you’ll implement in Kotlin.  ¡	Directly rotate the original tree  eliminating the list unbalanced tree process  ¡	Accept a certain amount of imbalance  If you’re interested in immutable data structures, I strongly encourage you to buy  and read Okasaki’s book. You can also read his 1996 thesis with the same title. It’s much  less complete than his book, but it’s available as a free download  http:  www.cs.cmu  .edu ~rwh theses okasaki.pdf .  11.1.1  Understanding the basic red-black tree structure  The red-black tree is a binary search tree with some additions to its structure and a  modified  insertion  algorithm  that  also  balances  the  result.  Unfortunately,  Okasaki  didn’t describe removal, which happens to be a far more complex process. But in 2014,  authors Germane and Might described this missing method.3  In a red-black tree, each tree  including subtrees  has an additional property rep- resenting its color. Note that it could be any color or even any property representing a  binary choice. Besides this, the structure is exactly the same as the binary tree structure,  as shown in the following listing.  1      2  3     1978 ,  Foundations of Com-   http:  www.computer.org csdl proceedings focs 1978 5428 00 542800008  Leo J.

When  modifying the tree, it’ll be tested to check whether these invariants are being broken  and to restore them through rotations and color changes if necessary. These invariants  are as follows:  ¡	An empty tree is black.  This doesn’t change, so there’s no need to verify it.    302  chapter 11  Solving problems with advanced trees  ¡	The left and right subtrees of a red tree are black. It’s not possible to find two   successive reds when descending the tree.  ¡	Every path from the root to an empty subtree has the same number of blacks.  Adding  an  element  to  a  red-black  tree  is  then  a  somewhat  complex  process  that  includes checking the invariants after insertion  and rebalancing, if necessary . Here’s  the corresponding algorithm:  ¡	An empty tree is always black. ¡	Insertion  proper  is  done  exactly  as  in  an  ordinary  tree  but  is  followed  by   balancing.  ¡	Inserting an element into an empty tree produces a red tree. ¡	After balancing, the root is blackened.  Figures 11.1 through 11.7 illustrate insertion of integers 1 through 7 into an initially  empty tree. This is the worst possible case, where elements are inserted in order. If  using an ordinary binary tree, this would result in a totally unbalanced tree. Figure 11.1  shows the insertion of element 1 into the empty tree. Because you’re inserting into an  empty tree, the initial color is red. Once the element is inserted, the root is blackened.  Insert 1  Red, because it’s inserted into an empty tree  Blacken the root.  1  1  Insert 2  Root is already black  1  Balance: do nothing  2  Figure 11.1    Step 1: insertion of  integer 1 into an initially empty tree  Figure 11.2 shows the insertion of element 2. The inserted element is red, the root is  already black, and there’s still no need for balancing.  Figure 11.2    Step 2: insertion of  integer 2 into an initially empty tree  Figure 11.3 illustrates insertion of element 3. The inserted element is red. The tree is  being balanced because it has two successive red elements. As the red element now has  two children, they are made black.  Children of a red element must always be black.   Eventually, the root is blackened.

Figure 11.3    Step 3: insertion of  integer 3 into an initially empty tree  Figure 11.4    Step 4: insertion of  integer 4 into an initially empty tree  Figure 11.5 illustrates the insertion of element 5. As you now have two successive red  elements, the tree must be balanced by making 3 the left child of 4, and 4 becomes the  right child of 2.  Figure 11.5    Step 5: insertion of  integer 5 into an initially empty tree   304  chapter 11  Solving problems with advanced trees  Figure 11.6 shows the insertion of element 6. No further manipulation is needed.  2  1  4  Insert 6  Balance: nothing to do  3  5  6  Figure 11.6    Step 6: insertion of  integer 6 into an initially empty tree  In figure 11.7, element 7 is added to the tree. As elements 6 and 7 are two successive red  elements, the tree must be balanced. The first step is to make element 5 the left child of  6 and 6 the right child of 4, which again leaves two successive red elements: 4 and 6. The  tree is once again balanced, making element 4 the root, 2 the left child of 4, and 3 the  right child of 2. The element 6 is blackened because every path to an empty subtree must  have the same number of blacks. The last operation consists of blackening the root.  The  balance  function  takes  the  same  arguments  as  the  tree  constructor:  color,  left, value, and right. These four parameters are tested for various patterns, and the  result is constructed accordingly. The balance function replaces the tree constructor.  You need to modify any process using the constructor to use this function instead. The  following list shows how each pattern of arguments is transformed by this function:  ¡	 T B  T R  T R a x b  y c  z d  ➞  T R  T B a x b   y  T B c z d   ¡	 T B  T R a x  T R b y c   z d  ➞  T R  T B a x b  y  T B c z d   ¡	 T B a x  T R  T R b y c  z d   ➞  T R  T B a x b  y  T B c z d   ¡	 T B a x  T R b y  T R c z d    ➞  T R  T B a x b  y  T B c z d   ¡	 T color a x b ➞  T color a x b   Each expression in parentheses corresponds to a tree. The letter T indicates a non- empty tree, and B and R indicate the black and red colors. Lowercase letters are place- holders for any value that could be valid at the corresponding place. Each left pattern   those to the left of the arrow, ➞  is applied in descending order, which means that if  a match is found, the corresponding right pattern is applied as the resulting tree. This  way of presenting things is similar to the when expression, with the last line being the  default case. exercise 11.1 Write  the  plus,  balance,  and  blacken  functions  for  adding  an  element  to  the  red- black tree.

The add function is similar to what you did in the standard binary search tree, with  the exception that the balance function replaces the T constructor. The add function  can be implemented as an abstract function in the Tree class with implementations in  Empty and T. Here’s the implementation in the Empty class: override fun add newVal: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree  = T R, E, newVal, E   And here’s the T implementation: override fun add newVal: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree  = when {         newVal   balance color, left.add newVal , value, right          newVal > value -> balance color, left, value, right.add newVal           else           -> when  color  {             B -> T B, left, newVal, right              R -> T R, left, newVal, right          }     }  In previous classes, you saw that it wasn’t possible to implement some function in the  Empty singleton because the A parameter wasn’t accessible  the singleton was parame- terized with Nothing . Using an abstract Empty class parameterized by A and extending  it with the  E  singleton object, you can implement functions in the  Empty  class while still having a singleton object for representing empty trees.  The blacken function is also implemented in the Tree class as an abstract function   with two implementations. Here’s the Empty implementation: override fun blacken  : Tree  = E   A use case for the red-black tree: Maps     307  Here’s the T implementation: override fun blacken  : Tree  = T B, left, value, right   Finally, the plus function is defined in the Tree class with the operator keyword. This  lets you use the + operator to call it. It returns the blackened result of add: operator fun plus value: @UnsafeVariance A : Tree  = add value .blacken    11.1.3  Removing elements from the red-black tree  Removing an element from a red-black tree is discussed by the already familiar authors  Germane  and  Might.4  The  implementation  in  Kotlin  is  too  long  to  include  in  this  book,  but  it’s  included  in  the  accompanying  code   http:  github.com pysaumont   fpinKotlin . It will be used in the next exercise.  11.2  A use case for the red-black tree: Maps  Trees of integers aren’t often useful  although sometimes they are . One important  use of binary search trees is maps, also called dictionaries or associative arrays. Maps  are collections of key value pairs that allow insertion, removal, and fast retrieval of  each pair.  Maps  are  familiar  to  programmers,  and  Kotlin  offers  several  implementations,  among  which  the  most  common  are  the  Map  and  the  MutableMap  types.  But  the  MutableMap can’t be used in a multi-threaded environment without providing some  protection mechanisms that are difficult to design correctly and to use. The Map type,  on the other hand, is protected against these kind of problems. But it isn’t efficient  because it doesn’t rely on data sharing, so a whole new map must be created for each  insertion or removal.  11.2.1  Implementing Map  Functional trees like the red-black tree you developed have the advantage of immu- tability, which lets you use them in multi-threaded environments without bothering  about locks and synchronization. This also provides benefits from good performance  because most data is shared between the old tree and the new tree when an element is  added or removed. Listing 11.3 shows the interface of a Map that can be implemented  using the red-black tree.

Another possible need is to fold the map, perhaps to get a list of the contained values.  Here’s an example of a delegating foldLeft function: fun   foldLeft identity: B, f:  B  ->      MapEntry   -> B, g:  B  ->  B  -> B : B =         delegate.foldLeft identity, { b ->             { me: MapEntry  ->                 f b  me              }         }, g   Note  that  folding  maps  generally  occur  in  specific  use  cases  that  deserve  to  be  abstracted inside the Map class. exercise 11.3 Write a values function in the Map class that returns a list of the values contained in the  map in ascending key order. hint You might have to create a new folding function in the Tree class and delegate to it  from the Map class. soLution There are several possible implementations of the values function. It would be pos- sible to delegate to the foldInOrder function, but this function iterates over the tree  values in ascending order. Using this function to construct a list would result in a list in  descending order.  You could reverse the result, but this wouldn’t be efficient. A much better solution  is to add a foldInReverseOrder function into the Tree class. Recall the foldInOrder  function: override fun   foldInOrder identity: B, f:  B  ->  A  ->  B  -> B : B =     f left.foldInOrder identity, f   value  right.foldInOrder identity, f    All you have to do is reverse the order: override fun   foldInReverseOrder identity: B,                                     f:  B  ->  A  ->  B  -> B : B =         f right.foldInReverseOrder identity, f   value  left                                    .foldInReverseOrder identity, f    As usual, the Empty implementation returns identity. Now you can delegate to this  function from inside the Map class: fun values  : List  =     sequence delegate.foldInReverseOrder List >    { lst1 ->         { me ->             { lst2 ->                 lst2.concat lst1.cons me.value               }         }     } .getOrElse List        11.2.3  A use case for the red-black tree: Maps     311  Map  11.4  Using Map with noncomparable keys The class is useful and relatively efficient, but it has a big disadvantage compared to the maps you might be used to: the keys must be comparable. Although the types used for keys are usually comparable, such as integers or strings, what if you need to use a noncomparable type for the keys? exercise Implement a version of hint You need to modify two things: first, the class should be made comparable, although the key isn’t. Second, non-equal values might be held in equal map entries, so collisions should be resolved by keeping both colliding entries. soLution The first thing to do is to modify the to be comparable: class MapEntry  private constructor val key: K,  class by removing the need for the key  that works with noncomparable keys.    MapEntry  MapEntry  Map     val value: Result  :  Comparable > {  MapEntry  Note that the    class is still comparable, although the Second, you must use a different implementation for the  function. One possibility is to compare the map entries based on a key hash-code comparison. Note that you need to slightly change the type parameter of the class, making the key class extend Any?, a nullable type, so you would need to handle nulls  otherwise in  throw a class MapEntry  private constructor val key: K,  Any. By default, it extends the NullPointerException:  type isn’t.

In such cases, you should keep both of them. The sim-   plest solution is to store the map entries in a list. To do this, you must modify the Map class. First, the tree delegate  in the constructor  will have a modified type: private val delegate: Tree >>> = Tree    happen   entries   when   have   map   two   Next, you’ll need a function to retrieve the list of key value tuples corresponding to the same key hash code: private fun getAll key: @UnsafeVariance K : Result >> =  delegate[MapEntry key.hashCode   ]  .flatMap { x ->                                                                                                               312  chapter    11  Solving problems with advanced trees  x.value.map { lt ->  lt.map { t -> t }  }  }  You  getAll  then   can  function.

Using  a list for storing the key value tuples might not be the most efficient implementation,  because searching in a list takes time proportional to the number of elements. But in  most cases, the list will contain only one element, so the search will return in no time.  For the same reason, it isn’t useful to optimize the search for the first occurrence match- ing the key criteria in the get function. If you want to do so, you can use an escaping  fold  fold with a “zero” parameter  instead of using filter plus headSafe which would  first travel the whole list before taking the first element. If you don’t remember how to  do so, refer to exercise 8.13.  One thing to note about this implementation is that the minus function tests whether  the resulting list of pairs is empty. If it is, it calls the minus function on the delegate.  Otherwise, it calls the plus function to re-insert the new list from which the correspond- ing entry has been deleted. Recall exercise 10.1 from chapter 10. This is possible only  because you chose to implement plus in such a way that an element found equal to an  element present in the map would be inserted in place of the original one. If you hadn’t  done that, you’d have to first remove the element and then insert the new one with the  modified list.  11.3   Implementing a functional priority queue As you know, a queue is a kind of list with a specific access protocol. Queues can be  single-ended, like the singly linked list you’ve used so often in the previous chapters.  In that case, the access protocol is last in, first out  LIFO . A queue can also be double-  ended, allowing the first in, first out  FIFO  access protocol. But there are also data  structures with more specialized protocols. Among them is the priority queue.  11.3.1  Looking at the priority queue access protocol  Values can be inserted in a priority queue in any order, but those can only be retrieved  in a specific order. All values have a priority level, and only the element with the high- est priority is available. Priority is represented by an ordering of the elements, which  implies that the elements must be comparable in some way.  The priority corresponds to the position of the elements in a theoretical waiting  queue. The highest priority belongs to the element with the lowest position  the first  element . By convention, the highest priority is represented by the lowest value.  Because a priority queue contains comparable elements, this makes it a good fit for  a tree-like structure. But from the user’s perspective, the priority queue is seen as a list  with a head  the element with the highest priority, meaning the lowest value  and a tail   the rest of the queue .  11.3.2  Exploring priority queue use cases  The priority queue has many different use cases. One that comes to mind quickly is  sorting. You could insert elements into a priority queue in random order and retrieve    314  chapter 11  Solving problems with advanced trees  them sorted. This isn’t the main use case for this structure, but it can be useful for sort- ing small data sets.  Another common use case is reordering elements after asynchronous parallel pro- cessing. Imagine you have a number of pages of data to process. To speed processing,  you can distribute the data among several threads that work in parallel. But there’s no  guarantee that the threads will return their work in the same order that they receive it.  To resynchronize the pages, you can put them in a priority queue. The process that’s  supposed to consume the pages then polls the queue to check if the available element   the head of the queue  is the expected one. For example, if pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and  8 are given to eight threads to be processed in parallel, the consumer polls the queue to  see if page 1 is available. If it is, it consumes it. If not, it waits.  In such a scenario, the queue acts both as a buffer and as a way to reorder the ele- ments. This generally implies limited variation in size, because elements are removed  from the queue more or less at the same speed they’re inserted. This is true if the con- sumer consumes elements at approximately the same pace as they’re produced by the  eight threads. If this isn’t the case, it might be possible to use several consumers.  As I said earlier, choosing an implementation is generally a matter of trading space  against time, or time against time. Here the choice you need to make is between inser- tion and retrieval times. In the general use case, retrieval time must be optimized over  insertion time because the ratio between the numbers of insertion and retrieval opera- tions will generally be largely in favor of retrieval.  The head will be often read without  being removed.   11.3.3  Looking at implementation requirements  You could implement a priority queue based on the red-black tree because finding the  minimum value is fast. But retrieval doesn’t mean removal. If you search for the min- imum value and find that it isn’t the one you want, you’ll have to come back later and  search again. One solution to this could be to memoize the lowest value on insertion.  The other change you might want to make is in regard to removal. Removing an ele- ment is relatively fast, but as you’ll always be removing the lowest element, it might be  possible to optimize the data structure for this operation.  Another important consideration would be in regard to duplicates. Although the  red-black tree doesn’t allow duplicates, the priority queue must because it’s perfectly  possible to have several elements with the same priority. The solution can be the same  as for maps—storing lists of elements  instead of single elements  with the same prior- ity. But this probably won’t be optimal for performance.  11.3.4  The leftist heap data structure  To meet the requirements for a priority queue, you’ll use the leftist heap described by  Okasaki.5 Okasaki defines the leftist heap as a heap-ordered tree with an additional  leftist property:   5  Chris Okasaki,  Purely Functional Data Structures   Cambridge University Press, 1999 .         Implementing a functional priority queue     315  ¡	A heap-ordered tree is a tree in which each branch of an element is greater than  or equal to the element itself. This guarantees that the lowest element in the tree  is always the root element, making access to the lowest value instantaneous.  ¡	With the leftist property, for each element, the left branch rank is greater than or   equal to the right branch rank.  ¡	The rank of an element is the length of the right path  also called the right spine   to an empty element. The leftist property guarantees that the shortest path from  any element to an empty element is the right path. A consequence of this is that  elements are always found in ascending order along any descending path. Fig- ure 11.8 shows an example of a leftist tree.  As  you  can  see,  retrieving  the  highest  priority  element  is  possible  in  constant  time  because it’ll always be the root of the tree. This element is called the head of the struc- ture.  Removing  an  element,  by  analogy  with  a  list,  consists  in  returning  the  rest  of  the tree once the root has been removed. This returned value is called the tail of the  structure.  11.3.5  Implementing the leftist heap  The leftist heap main class is called Heap and should be a tree implementation. List- ing 11.4 shows the basic structure. The main difference from the trees you’ve devel- oped up to now is that functions such as right, left, and head  equivalent to what was  called value in previous examples  return a Result instead of a raw value. Also note  that the rank is computed by the callers of the constructor instead of by the construc- tor itself. This is an unmotivated design choice to show another way of doing things. As  the constructors are private, the difference won’t leak outside the Heap class.  0  Rank 2  1  Rank 3  1  Rank 1  2  Rank 2  2  Rank 2  5  Rank 1  2  Rank 1  6  Rank 1  7  Rank 1  5  Rank 1  Figure 11.8    A heap-ordered leftist tree, showing that each branch of an element is  higher than or equal to the element itself and each left-branch rank is greater than or  equal to the corresponding right-branch rank.   316  chapter 11  Solving problems with advanced trees  Listing 11.4    The leftist heap structures  sealed class Heap > {      internal abstract val left: Result >       internal abstract val right: Result >       internal abstract val head: Result        protected abstract val rank: Int     abstract val size: Int       abstract val isEmpty: Boolean  Functions left, right, and  head all return a Result.

If it is, the new rank is set to the rank of the second heap + 1, and the two heaps are used in first, second order. Otherwise, the new rank is set to the first heap rank + 1, and the two heaps are used in reverse order  second, first . Now the function to merge two heaps can be written as follows: fun  > merge first: Heap , second: Heap  : Heap  =  greater   equal   rank   than   or   to   is   first.head.flatMap { fh ->  second.head.flatMap { sh ->  when {  fh   first.left.flatMap { fl ->  first.right.map { fr ->                                                                                                                               318  chapter 11  Solving problems with advanced trees                          merge fh, fl, merge fr, second                       }                 }                 else -> second.left.flatMap { sl ->                     second.right.map { sr ->                         merge sh, sl, merge first, sr                       }                 }             }         }     }.getOrElse when  first  {                     E -> second                     else -> first                 }   If one of the heaps to be merged is empty, you return the other one. Otherwise, you  compute the result of the merge. With these functions defined, it’s easy to create the  plus function: operator fun plus element: @UnsafeVariance A : Heap  =                                     merge this, Heap element    11.3.6  Implementing the queue-like interface  Although it’s implemented as a tree, the heap from the user’s perspective is like a pri- ority queue, which means a kind of linked list where the head is always the smallest  element. By analogy, the root element of the tree is called the head and what remains  after having removed the head is called the tail. exercise 11.6 Define a tail function that returns what’s left after removing the head. This function,  like the head function, returns a Result in order to make it safe when it’s called on an  empty queue. Here’s its signature in the Heap parent class: abstract fun tail  : Result >  soLution The Empty implementation is obvious and returns a Failure: override fun tail  : Result > =    Result.failure IllegalStateException "tail   called on empty heap"    The H implementation is no more complex, given the functions you defined in the pre- vious exercise. It returns the result of merging the left and right branches: override fun tail  : Result > = Result merge lft, rght    exercise 11.7 Implement a get function that takes an int parameter and returns the nth element by  priority order. This function will return a Result to handle the case where no element  is found. Here’s its signature in the Heap parent class: fun get index: Int : Result    11.4  Elements and sorted lists  Elements and sorted lists     319  soLution The Empty implementation is obvious and returns a failure: override fun get index: Int : Result  =         Result.failure NoSuchElementException "Index out of bounds"    The H implementation is equally simple. It starts by testing the index. If it’s 0, it returns  Success of the head value. Otherwise, it recursively searches for the element of index  index - 1 in the tail. Because the tail doesn’t exist, but is only the value returned by the  tail function  which is a Result , this result is flat-mapped with a recursive call to get: override fun get index: Int : Result  = when  index  {     0 -> Result hd      else -> tail  .flatMap { it.get index - 1  } }  You might want a more explicit message when no element is found. You can’t use the  value  of  the  index  in  the  Empty  implementation  because  it’s  already  decremented.  To overcome this, there are many possible solutions. Consider this as an additional  optional exercise.  It will sometimes be useful to transform a Heap into a sorted list. This seems an easy  task: simply pop elements out of the heap one at a time and add them to a list. But this  is a specific case of a more general fold operation. exercise 11.8 Create a function pop that pops an element out of the heap, returning an option of a  pair containing both the head and the tail of the heap. If the heap is empty, this Option  will be None. Then write a function creating a sorted list from a heap. hint Here’s the pop function signature: fun pop  : Option >>  soLution Here’s a possible pop implementation. First define an abstract function in the Heap  class: abstract fun pop  : Option >>  The implementation in the Empty class returns an empty option: override fun pop  : Option >> = Option    In the H class, the pop function returns an Option of a pair containing the head and the  tail of the heap: override fun pop  : Option >> =                     Option Pair hd, merge lft, rght      320  chapter    11  Solving problems with advanced trees  pop  The return type of the defined for the parent fun toList  : List  = unfold this  { it.pop   }  type.

That’s because you ensured that no heap could  be created without a comparator if the type parameter didn’t extend Comparable. The  plus function must also be modified as follows: operator fun plus element: @UnsafeVariance A : Heap  =                          merge this, Heap element, comparator    Finally, the left and right functions in the Empty class must be changed as follows: override val left: Result > = Result this  override val right: Result > = Result this   Summary  recursive operations.  about tree balancing.  ¡	Trees can be balanced for better performance and to avoid stack overflow in   ¡	The red-black tree is a self-balancing tree structure that frees you from worrying   ¡	Maps can be implemented by delegating to a tree storing key value tuples. ¡	Maps with noncomparable keys must handle collisions in order to store elements   with the same key representation.  ¡	Priority queues are structures allowing elements to be retrieved by priority order.   324  chapter 11  Solving problems with advanced trees  ¡	Priority queues can be implemented using a leftist heap, which is a heap-ordered   ¡	Priority queues of noncomparable elements can be constructed using an addi-  binary tree.  tional comparator.   12Functional input output  In this chapter ¡	Applying effects safely from inside contexts ¡	Combining effects for success and failure ¡	Safely reading data ¡	Using the IO type and imperative-like control   structures  ¡	Combining IO operations  So far you’ve learned how to write safe programs that haven’t produced any usable results.

More interestingly, you’ve learned how to use nonfunctional operations in a safe, functional way. are operations producing side effects such as throwing exceptions, changing the outside world, or depending on the out- side world to produce a result. For example, you learned how to take an integer divi- sion, which is a potentially unsafe operation, and turn it into a safe one by using it inside a computational context. Here are some examples of computational contexts you’ve created in previous chapters:  Nonfunctional  operations  ¡  From chapter 7, the error in a safe, error-free way.

It also deals with the absence of  data, represented by an empty list.  ¡	The Lazy type from chapter 9 is a computational context for data that might  not be initialized until it’s needed, and the Stream context does the same for  collections.  When studying these types, producing a usable result wasn’t the objective. In this chap- ter, you’ll learn several techniques for producing practical results from your programs.  This includes displaying a result for your users or passing a result to another program.  Recall what you did to apply a function to the result of an integer operation. Let’s say  you want to write an inverse function that computes the multiplication inverse of an  integer value: val inverse:  Int  -> Result  = { x ->     when {         x != 0 -> Result 1.toDouble     x          else   -> Result.failure "Division by 0"      } }  This  function  can  be  applied  to  an  integer  value,  but  when  composed  with  other  functions, the value will be the output of another function! It’ll usually be in context  already, often the same type of context. Here’s an example: val ri: Result  = ... val rd: Result  = ri.flatMap inverse   It’s important to note that you don’t take the value in ri out of context to apply the  function. It works the other way round: you pass the function into the context  the  Result type  so that it can be applied inside it, producing a new context that possibly  wraps the resulting value. In the preceding snippet, you’re passing the function to the  ri context, producing the new rd context.  This is neat and safe. No bad things can happen and no exceptions can be thrown.  This is the beauty of programming with pure functions: you have a program that always  works, whatever data you use as input. But the question is, how can you use this result?  Suppose you want to display the result on the console—how can you do this?  12.1.1  Handling effects  Pure functions are defined as functions without any observable side effects. An effect is  anything that can be observed from outside the program. The role of a function is to  return a value, and side effects are anything besides the returned value that’s observable    12.1.2  Implementing effects  What does effects in context mean?     327  from the outside of the function. It’s called a side effect because it comes in addition  to the value that’s returned. By contrast, an effect is like a side effect, but it’s the main   and  generally  unique   role  of  a  program.  Making  your  programs  safe  is  obtained  by writing programs with pure functions  with no side effects  and pure effects  not  returning any values  in a functional way.  The question is, what does it mean to handle effects in a functional way? The closest  definition I can give at this stage is this: handling effects in a way that doesn’t interfere  with the principles of functional programming, the most important principle being  referential transparency.  There are several ways to approach or reach this goal, but fully attaining it can be  complex. Often, simply approaching it is sufficient. It’s up to you to decide which tech- nique you want to use. Applying effects inside contexts is the simplest way to make oth- erwise functional programs produce observable effects.  As I mentioned, an effect is anything that’s observable from outside the program. To  be valuable, the effect must generally reflect the result of the program. That being so,  you’ll generally need to take the result of the program and do something observable  with it.  Note that observable doesn’t always mean observable by a human operator. Often the  result is observable by another program, which might then translate this effect into  something observable by a human operator, either in a synchronous or an asynchro- nous way.  Printing to the computer screen can be seen by the operator. This is generally what  it’s meant to be. Writing to a database, on the other hand, might not always be directly  visible to a user. Sometimes the user will look up the result, but usually it’ll be read later  by another program. In chapter 13, you’ll learn how such effects can be used by pro- grams to communicate with other programs.  Because an effect is generally applied to a value, a pure effect can be modeled as a  special kind of function, returning no value. This is represented in Kotlin by the follow- ing type:  T  -> Unit  This type can be instantiated using Any as the type because it’s the parent of all types: val display = { x: Any -> println x  }  Or better yet, you can use a function reference: val display:  Any  -> Unit = ::println  But  most  often,  effects  like  functions  are  used  anonymously  as  in  the  following  example: val ri: Result  = ... val rd: Result  = ri.flatMap inverse  rd.map { it * 1.35 }   328  chapter 12  Functional input output  Here the function { it * 2.35 } has no name. But you could give it a name in order  to be able to reuse it: val ri: Result  = ... val rd: Result  = ri.flatMap inverse  val function:  Double  -> Double = { it * 2.35 } val result = rd.map function   To apply effects, you’d need something equivalent, such as val ri: Result  = ... val rd: Result  = ri.flatMap inverse  val function:  Double  -> Double = { it * 2.35 } val result = rd.map function  val ef:  Double  -> Unit = ::println result.map ef   Guess what? It works! This is possible because ef is a function returning Unit  the equiva- lent of void in Java, or rather, the equivalent of Void . The previous code is equivalent to val ri: Result  = ... val rd: Result  = ri.flatMap inverse  val function:  Double  -> Double = { it * 2.35 } val result = rd.map function  val ef:  Double  -> Unit = ::println val x: Result  = result.map ef   To apply an effect, you could use this technique, mapping the effect and ignoring the  result. But you can do better. As you saw in chapter 7, you wrote a forEach function in  the Result class taking an effect and applying it to the underlying value. This function  was implemented in the Empty class as follows: override fun forEach onSuccess:  Nothing  -> Unit,                      onFailure:  RuntimeException  -> Unit,                      onEmpty:    -> Unit  {     onEmpty   }  In the Success class, it was implemented like this: override fun forEach onSuccess:  A  -> Unit,                      onFailure:  RuntimeException  -> Unit,                      onEmpty:    -> Unit  {     onSuccess value  }  And in the Failure class, this was the implementation: override fun forEach onSuccess:  A  -> Unit,                      onFailure:  RuntimeException  -> Unit,                      onEmpty:    -> Unit  {     onFailure exception  }   What does effects in context mean?     329  The forEach function takes three effects as its parameters: one for Success, one for  Failure, and one for Empty. Furthermore, the abstract declaration in the Result par- ent class declared default values for each effect: abstract fun forEach onSuccess:  A  -> Unit = {},                      onFailure:  RuntimeException  -> Unit = {},                      onEmpty:    -> Unit = {}   You can’t write unit tests for this function. To verify that it works, you can run the pro- gram shown in the following listing and look at the result onscreen.  You can write  some tests altering some global or parameter’s state and then assert these changes, but  this isn’t unit testing!

Its signature is this: fun forEach ef:  A  -> Unit   soLution You can implement this function in the parent List class or declare it as an abstract  function  and  implement  it  in  both  subclasses.  Unlike  in  Result.Empty,  there’s  no    330  chapter 12  Functional input output  reason to evaluate any effect when the list is empty  although you could do so if it suits  your use case . The implementation for the Nil will be this: override fun forEach ef:  Nothing  -> Unit  {}  The simplest recursive implementation for the Cons class would be as follows: override fun forEach ef:  A  -> Unit  {     ef head      tail.forEach ef  }  Unfortunately, this implementation will blow the stack if you’ve more than a few thou- sand elements. The solution is to make this function tail-recursive. The easiest way is to  define a tail-recursive helper function locally is in the forEach function: override fun forEach ef:  A  -> Unit  {     tailrec fun forEach list: List   {         when  list  {             Nil -> {}             is Cons -> {                 ef list.head                  forEach list.tail              }         }     }     forEach this  }  12.2  Reading data  So far we’ve only dealt with output. Often, outputting data occurs at the end of the  program once the result is computed. This allows most of the program to be written  without effects with all the benefits of the functional paradigm. Only the output part  isn’t functional.  We haven’t looked at how to input data into programs. Let’s do that now. Later you’ll  look at a more functional way to input data. But first, you’ll look at how to do it in a  clean  although imperative  way that fits nicely with the functional parts.  12.2.1  Reading data from the console  As an example, you’ll read data from the console in a way that, although imperative,  allows testing by making your programs deterministic. You’ll first develop an example  that reads integers and strings. The following listing shows the interface you’ll need to  implement.  Listing 12.2    An interface for inputting data  interface Input: Closeable {   Extends the  Closeable  interface      fun readString  : Result >       fun readInt  : Result >   Inputs an integer and  a string, respectively   Reading data     331  Passes a  message as a  parameter      fun readString message: String : Result > =                                           readString         fun readInt message: String : Result > =                                           readInt    }  In the listing, extending the Closeable interface will be useful for automatically clos- ing resources that need to be closed. Passing a message as a parameter can be useful  for prompting the user.   But here the provided default implementations ignores the message. Note that these  functions  return  Result >  and  not  Result ,  which  allows chaining function calls in a referentially transparent manner.  You could write a concrete implementation for this interface, but first you’ll write  an abstract one  because you might want to read data from some other source, such as  a file . You’ll put the common code in an abstract class and extend it for each type of  input. The following listing shows this implementation.  Listing 12.3    The AbstractReader implementation  Builds this class with a  reader, allowing for  different sources of input  abstract class AbstractReader           private val reader: BufferedReader : Input {       override fun readString  :                  Result > = try {          reader.readLine  .let {             when {                 it.isEmpty   -> Result                   else         -> Result Pair it, this               }         }     } catch  e: Exception  {         Result.failure e      }  Reads a line from the reader and returns a  Result.Empty if the line is empty, a Result. Success if some data is obtained, or a  Result.Failure if something goes wrong      override fun readInt  : Result > = try {         reader.readLine  .let {             when {                 it.isEmpty   -> Result                   else         -> Result Pair it.toInt  , this               }         }     } catch  e: Exception  {         Result.failure e      }      override fun close  : Unit = reader.close    }  Delegates to the close function  of the BufferedReader   332  chapter 12  Functional input output  Now you need to implement the concrete class in order to read from the console, as  shown in the next listing. This class is responsible for providing the reader. Additionally,  you’ll re- implement the two default functions from the interface to display a prompt to  the user.  class ConsoleReader reader: BufferedReader : AbstractReader reader  {  Listing 12.4    The ConsoleReader implementation  import com.fpinkotlin.common.Result  import java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.InputStreamReader      override fun readString message: String :                     Result > {          print "$message "          return readString       }      override fun readInt message: String :                     Result > {          print "$message "          return readInt       }      companion object {         operator fun invoke  : ConsoleReader =             ConsoleReader BufferedReader                      InputStreamReader System.`in`          } }  The two default functions  are reimplemented to  display the user prompt.  You must use backticks to  reference the in field of a Java  System class because in is a  reserved word in Kotlin.  Now you can use your ConsoleReader class with what you’ve learned to write a com- plete program, from input to output. The following listing shows the program.  Listing 12.5    A complete program, from input to output  Calls readString with a user prompt and returns a  Result >, which is mapped to  produce a Result   The business part of the program  what the  program is supposed to do from the user’s point of  view . It can be functionally pure.  fun main args: Array   {      val input = ConsoleReader     Creates the reader      val rString = input.readString "Enter your name:"                                        .map { t -> t.first }      val nameMessage = rString.map { "Hello, $it!" }       nameMessage.forEach ::println, onFailure =                             { println it.message }    Applies the pattern from the  previous section to either the  result or an error message   Reading data     333      val rInt = input.readInt "Enter your age:" .map  { t -> t.first }      val ageMessage = rInt.map { "You look younger than $it!" }      ageMessage.forEach ::println, onFailure =         { println "Invalid age. Please enter an integer" }  }  Prints a different message  than the one in the exception  Note that there is no way to refer to the input value in the ageMessage.forEach effect.  For doing so, you would need to use a specific validating context rather than Result.  This program isn’t impressive. It’s the equivalent of the ubiquitous “Hello” program  that’s usually the second example  just after “Hello  world”  in most programming  books. Of course, this is only an example. What’s interesting is how easy it is to evolve  this into something more useful. exercise 12.2 Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to input an integer ID, a first name, and  a last name, and that later displays the list of people on the console. Data input stops as  soon as the user enters a blank ID and the list of entered data is then displayed. hint You’ll need a class to hold each line of data. Use the Person data class shown here: data class Person  val id: Int, val firstName: String, val lastName: String   Implement the solution in a main function at package level. Use the Stream.unfold func- tion to produce a stream of persons. You might find it easier to create a separate function  for inputting the data corresponding to a single person, and to use a function reference as  the argument of unfold. This function could have the following signature: fun person input: Input : Result >  soLution The solution is simple. Considering that you have a function for inputting the data  for a single person, you can create a stream of persons and print the result as follows   ignoring any error in this case and not taking care of closing resources : import com.fpinkotlin.common.List import com.fpinkotlin.common.Stream  fun readPersonsFromConsole  : List  =     Stream.unfold ConsoleReader  , ::person .toList    fun main args: Array   {     readPersonsFromConsole  .forEach ::println  }   334  chapter 12  Functional input output  All you need now is the person function. This function asks for the ID, the first name,  and the last name, producing three Result instances that can be combined using the  comprehension pattern you learned in previous chapters: fun person input: Input : Result > =     input.readInt "Enter ID:" .flatMap { id ->         id.second.readString "Enter first name:"              .flatMap { firstName ->                 firstName.second.readString "Enter last name:"                      .map { lastName ->                         Pair Person id.first,                                     firstName.first,                                     lastName.first , lastName.second              }         }     }  The comprehension pattern is probably one of the most important patterns in func- tional programming, so you want to master it. Other languages such as Scala or Haskell  have syntactic sugar for it, but Kotlin doesn’t. This corresponds, in pseudo-code, to  something like this: for {   id in input.readInt "Enter ID:"    firstName in id.second.readString "Enter first name:"    lastName in firstName.second.readString "Enter last name:"  } return Pair Person id.first, firstName.first, lastName.first , lastName.  second    You shouldn’t miss the syntactic sugar. The flatMap idiom is perhaps more difficult to  master at first, but it shows what’s happening. Many programmers know this pattern as  the following: a.flatMap { b ->     flatMap { c ->         map { d ->             getSomething a, b, c, d          }     } }  They often think it’s always a series of flatMaps ending with a map. This isn’t the case.  Whether it’s map or flatMap depends solely on the return type. It often happens that  the last function  here, getSomething  returns a bare value. This is why the pattern  ends with a map. But if getSomething were to return a Result, the pattern would be as  follows: a.flatMap { b ->     flatMap { c ->         flatMap { d ->             getSomething a, b, c, d          }     } }   Reading data     335    12.2.2  Reading from a file The FileReader ion object creating the shown in the next listing.  class is similar to  way you’ve designed the program makes it simple to adapt it to reading files.

For this, you should use the function of the Kotlin standard library. soLution In the following solution, note how the that the file is correctly closed in any case: fun readPersonsFromFile path: String : Result > =  program, you’ll have to deal with the fact that Try  Also   use  function is employed in order to ensure  ReadConsole Result.   function   returns     invoke  person  reuse   same  the   use  to   a  FileReader path .map {  it.use {  Stream.unfold it, ::person .toList    }  }  fun main args: Array   {  val path = "  data.txt" readPersonsFromFile path .forEach { list: List  ->                                                                                           336  chapter 12  Functional input output          list.forEach ::println      }, onFailure = ::println  }  The it reference is used twice in the readPersonsFromFile function, each time rep- resenting the parameter of the current lambda expression. If you find this confusing,  you can use specific names such as fun readPersonsFromFile path: String : Result > =         FileReader path .map { input1 ->             input1.use { input2 ->                 Stream.unfold input2, ::person .toList               }         }  But in this specific case, both names represent the same object.  12.3  Testing with input  One of the benefits of the approach shown is that the program is easily testable. It  would  be  possible  to  test  your  programs  by  providing  files  instead  of  user  input  at  the console, but it’s just as easy to interface your program with another program that  produces  a  script  of  the  input  commands.  The  following  listing  shows  an  example  ScriptReader that you could use for testing.  Listing 12.7    A ScriptReader that allows you to use a list of input commands  class ScriptReader : Input {      constructor commands: List   : super   {          this.commands = commands     }      constructor vararg commands: String  : super   {          this.commands = List *commands      }      private val commands: List   The ScriptReader can be  created with a list of  commands...  …or with a vararg argument.  override fun close   { }  override fun readString  : Result > = when {  commands.isEmpty   ->  Result.failure "Not enough entries in script"   else -> Result Pair commands.headSafe  .getOrElse "" ,  ScriptReader commands.drop 1      }  override fun readInt  : Result > = try {  when {  commands.isEmpty   ->  Result.failure "Not enough entries in script"   Integer.parseInt commands.headSafe  .getOrElse ""   >= 0 ->   Fully functional input output     337  Result Pair Integer.parseInt   commands.headSafe  .getOrElse ""  , ScriptReader commands.drop 1      else -> Result    }  } catch  e: Exception  {  Result.failure e   }  }  }    12.4    12.4.1  The next listing shows an example of using the panying this book, you’ll find examples of unit testing.

It might not be worth the additional complexity, but it is useful to learn these techniques so you can make an educated choice.  Making input output fully functional There are several answers to the question of how can you make input output  I O  fully functional. The shortest answer is that you can’t.

Some libraries fall into this category. Libraries are programs designed to be used by other programs. They receive argument  argu- ments. In the first two sections of this chapter, you separated your programs into three parts: one doing the input, one doing the output, and one, the third part, acting as a library and being fully functional.  computations   resulting   return   values   values   based   from   and   the   on   Another way to handle the problem is to write this library part and produce as the final return value another  nonfunctional  program that handles all the input and out- put. This is similar in concept to laziness. You can handle I O as something that happens later in a separate program will be the returned value of our purely functional program.                                                                                                                                                               338  chapter 12  Functional input output  12.4.2  Implementing purely functional I O  In  this  section,  you’ll  see  how  to  implement  purely  functional  I O.  Let’s  start  with  output. Imagine that you want to display a welcome message to the console. Instead of  writing this fun sayHello name: String  = println "Hello, $name!"   you could make the sayHello function return a program that, once run, will have the  same effect: fun sayHello name: String :    -> Unit = { println "Hello, $name!"  }  You can use this function as follows: fun main args: Array   {     val program = sayHello "Georges"  }  This code is purely functional. You could argue that it doesn’t do anything visible, and  this is true. It produces a program that can be run to produce the desired effect. This  program can be run by evaluating its result. This result is a program that isn’t func- tional, but we don’t care. The main program is functional.  As I’ve said several times, the best way to make programs safe is to clearly separate  functional parts from effects. The technique shown here, if not the easiest to imple- ment, is clearly the ultimate solution when it comes to separating functions from effects. Is this cheating? No. Think of a program written in any functional language. In the  end, it’s compiled into an executable program that’s absolutely nonfunctional and that  can be run on your computer. You’re doing exactly the same thing here, except that the  program you’re producing might seem to be written in Kotlin. In fact, it’s not. It’s writ- ten in some kind of DSL  Domain-Specific Language  that your program is construct- ing. To execute this program, you can write program    In this example, the program produced is of type    → Unit. This works, but it’d be  interesting to do more with this result than simply to evaluate it. For example, you  might want to combine several of these kinds of results in many useful ways. For this,  you need something much more powerful, so you’ll create a new type named IO. You’ll  start with a single invoke function. At this stage, it’s not much different from     →  Unit: class IO private val f:    -> Unit  {      operator fun invoke   = f   }  Suppose you’ve the three following functions: fun show message: String : IO = IO { println message  }  fun   toString rd: Result  : String =         rd.map { it.toString   }.getOrElse { rd.toString   }   Fully functional input output     339  fun inverse i: Int : Result  = when  i  {     0 -> Result.failure "Div by 0"      else -> Result 1.0   i  }  You might write the following purely functional program: val computation: IO = show toString inverse 3     This program produces another program that can later be executed: computation    12.4.3  Combining I O  With your new IO interface, you can potentially build any program, but as a single unit.  It’d be interesting to be able to combine such programs. The simplest combination  you could use consists of grouping two programs into one. This is what you’ll do in the  following exercise. exercise 12.4 Create a function in the IO class that lets you group two IO instances into one. This func- tion will be called plus and it’ll have a default implementation. Here’s the signature: operator fun plus io: IO : IO  soLution The solution is to return a new IO with a run implementation that first executes the  current IO and then the argument IO: operator fun plus io: IO : IO = IO {         f           io.f       }  You’ll later need a “do nothing” IO to serve as a neutral element for some IO combina- tions. You can easily create this in the IO companion object as follows: companion object {     val empty: IO = IO {} }  Using these new functions, you can create more sophisticated programs by combining  IO instances: fun getName   = "Mickey"  These three lines don’t print  anything. They are like  instructions of the DSL.  val instruction1 = IO { print "Hello, "  }  val instruction2 = IO { print getName    }  val instruction3 = IO { print "!\n"  }       val script: IO = instruction1                     + instruction2                     + instruction3  script     Combines the three instructions  to create a program  Executes the program   340  chapter 12  Functional input output  If you prefer, you can use function calls instead of operators: instruction1.plus instruction2 .plus instruction3     You can also create a program from a list of instructions: val script = List          IO { print "Hello, "  },         IO { print getName    },         IO { print "!\n"  }    Does this look like an imperative program? In fact, it is. In order to be able to execute  it, you must first compile it into a single IO. You can do this with a right fold: val program: IO = script.foldRight IO.empty  { io -> { io + it } }  Or a left fold: val program: IO = script.foldLeft IO.empty  { acc -> { acc + it } }  You can see why you needed a do nothing implementation. Finally, you can run the  program as usual: program    Be aware that using a left fold causes the identity IO to be placed in first position,   as opposed to a right fold in which the identity IO is placed in last position. Using  IO.empty for the identity makes no difference. But if you use another IO  for exam- ple, some initialization task , it’ll probably have to be executed first, so you’ll have to  use a left fold. Use a right fold if you want to use some finalizing task as the identity.  12.4.4  Handling input with IO  At this point, your IO type only handles output. To make it handle input, one necessary  change is to parameterize it with the type of the input value so that it can be used to  handle this value. Here’s the new parameterized IO type: class IO  private val f:    -> A  {       operator fun invoke   = f        companion object {         val empty: IO  = IO { }   The IO class is parameterized and the  function it is built with returns an  instance of the class parameter type.  The empty instance is parameterized with Unit and  created with a function returning nothing.  Be aware  that this is different from returning Nothing.          operator fun   invoke a: A : IO  = IO { a }      } }  The invoke function of the companion object takes a bare  value and returns it in the IO context.   Fully functional input output     341  As you can see, the IO interface creates a context for computations in the same way  Option, Result, List, Stream, Lazy, and the like do. It similarly has a function return- ing an empty instance, as well as a function that puts a bare value in context.  In order to perform computations on IO values, you now need functions like map and  flatMap to bind functions to the IO context. But in order to be able to test these func- tions, you’ll first define an object for representing the computer console. exercise 12.5 Define a Console object with the three following functions: object Console {      fun readln  : IO  = TODO ""       fun println o: Any : IO  = TODO ""       fun print o: Any : IO  = TODO ""  }  soLution The print and println functions call the Kotlin equivalent functions on their argu- ment like this: fun println o: Any : IO  = IO {     kotlin.io.println o.toString    }  fun print o: Any : IO  = IO {     kotlin.io.print o.toString    }  You must use the fully qualified function names to avoid the functions calling them- selves. You might, however, call your functions by any other name.  The  readln function calls the  realLine function of a  BufferedReader wrapping   System.in. Remember you must use backticks because in is a reserved word in Kotlin: private val br = BufferedReader InputStreamReader System.`in`    fun readln  : IO  = IO {     try {         br.readLine       } catch  e: IOException  {         throw IllegalStateException e      } }  For the sake of simplicity, you can throw an exception if something goes wrong. Feel  free to handle the problem in a more functional way if you prefer.  The Console object, at this stage, brings only additional complexity with no benefit.   In order to be able to compose IO instances, you’ll need a map function.   342  chapter    12  Functional input output  that takes as its argument a function from  A  to  B  and  IO   IO .  12.6 map  function in  exercise Define a returns an soLution Here’s the implementation that applies the function to the value of the result in a new fun   map  g:  A  -> B : IO  = IO {  context:  IO  g this     this  and returns  }  }  }  }  Here’s how you can use this function: fun main args: Array   {  val script = sayHello   script    private fun sayHello  : IO  = Console.print "Enter your name: "   .map { Console.readln     } .map { buildMessage it  } .map { Console.println it    }  private fun buildMessage name: String : String = "Hello, $name!"  in  is   as   12.7 the  necessary   repeatedly  This   IO cumbersome.   Console.readln     because   exercise Invoking  is  instances and not raw values. Write a function takes a function from soLution The solution is obvious. All you need to do is to invoke the function returns in order to flatten it to an fun   flatMap  g:  A  -> IO  : IO  = IO {  functions  flatMap  IO :  IO   to  A  g this       and readln    Console.println it    and   IO function to abstract this process. This  println  return  as its argument and returns an  IO .  IO >  that the    map  As you can see, this is kind of recursive. It won’t be a problem at first because there’s only one recursion step, but it could become a problem if you were to chain a huge number of fun main args: Array   {  calls. Now you can compose I O in a functional way:  flatMap  val script = sayHello   script    private fun sayHello  : IO  = Console.print "Enter your name: "   .flatMap { Console.readln   } .map { buildMessage it  } .flatMap { Console.println it  }  private fun buildMessage name: String : String = "Hello, $name!"                                                                                                             Fully functional input output     343  The  sayHello  function  is  totally  safe.  It  never  throws  an  IOException  because  it  doesn’t  perform  any  I O  operation.  It  only  returns  a  program  that  performs  these  operations once executed, which is done by invoking the returned value  script   .  Only this invocation can throw an exception.  12.4.5  Extending the IO type  By using the  IO type, you can create impure programs  programs with effects  in a  purely functional way. But at this stage, these programs only allow you to read from and  print to an element such as your Console class. You can extend your DSL by adding  instructions to create control structures, such as loops and conditionals.  First, you’ll implement a loop similar to the for indexed loop. This will take the  form of a repeat function that takes the number of iterations and the IO to repeat as its  parameters. exercise 12.8 Implement  the  repeat  function  in  the  IO  companion  object  with  the  following  signature: fun   repeat n: Int, io: IO   : IO >  hint To simplify coding in the IO class, you might need an additional fill function in the  Stream companion object. This function creates a stream of n non evaluated elements: fun   fill n: Int, elem: Lazy  : Stream  {     tailrec     fun   fill acc: Stream , n: Int, elem: Lazy  : Stream  =         when {             n   acc             else -> fill Cons elem, Lazy { acc } , n - 1, elem          }     return fill Empty, n, elem  }  You should create a collection of IO, representing each iteration, and then fold this  collection by combining IO instances. To do this, you’ll need something more power- ful than the plus function. Start by implementing a map2 function with the following  signature: fun   map2 ioa: IO , iob: IO , f:  A  ->   B  -> C : IO   soLution The map2 function can be implemented as follows: fun   map2 ioa: IO , iob: IO , f:  A  ->   B  -> C : IO  =         ioa.flatMap { a ->             iob.map { b ->                 f a  b              }         }   344  chapter 12  Functional input output  This is a simple application of the ubiquitous comprehension pattern. With this func- tion at hand, you can easily implement repeat as follows: fun   repeat n: Int, io: IO   : IO > =                 Stream.fill n, Lazy { io }                          .foldRight  Lazy { IO { List    } }  { ioa ->                             { sioLa ->                                 map2 ioa, sioLa    { a ->                                     { la: List  -> cons a, la  }                                 }                             }                         }  This may look a bit complex, but that’s partly because of the line being wrapped for  printing, and partly because it’s written as a one-liner for optimization. It’s equivalent  to this: fun   repeat n: Int, io: IO   : IO > {     val stream: Stream > = Stream.fill n, Lazy { io }      val f:  A  ->  List   -> List   =         { a ->             { la: List  -> cons a, la  }         }     val g:  IO   ->  Lazy >>  -> IO > =         { ioa ->             { sioLa ->                 map2 ioa, sioLa  , f              }         }     val z: Lazy >> = Lazy { IO { List    } }     return stream.foldRight z, g  }  TIP    If you’re using an IDE, it’s relatively easy to find the types. For example, in  IntelliJ, you need to put the mouse pointer on a reference while holding down  the Ctrl key to display the type.  With these functions, you can now write the following: val program = IO.repeat 3, sayHello     This  gives  you  a  program  that’s  equivalent  to  calling  the  following  function  as  sayHello 3 : fun sayHello n: Int  {      val br = BufferedReader InputStreamReader System.`in`        for  i in 0 until n  {         print "Enter your name: "          val name = br.readLine           println buildMessage name       } }   Fully functional input output     345  important   The  difference,  three times eagerly, whereas program that does the same only when its  that  IO.repeat 3,   however,   is   sayHello 3   calling sayHello     executes   effect returns a  non evaluated   the   invoke    function is called.  to  code   define  that   many  can   other  be   control  downloaded   structures.  from  the http:  github.com pysaumont   examples   You’ll   find   in   It’s   possible  accompanying  fpinkotlin.

Only running the program it returns might do so.  exercise In order to experiment with blowing the stack, create a IO IO Here’s the corresponding signature in the fun   forever ioa: IO  : IO   function that takes an executing the argument in an endless loop.

All you have to do is to make the con- structed  program  infinitely  recursive.  Be  aware  that  the  forever  function  itself  shouldn’t be recursive. Only the returned program should be.  The solution is to use a helper function of type    → IO, and to flatMap the IO argu-  ment of the forever function with a function invoking this helper function: fun   forever ioa: IO  : IO  {     val t:    -> IO  = { forever ioa  }     return ioa.flatMap { t   } }  This function can be used as follows: fun main args: Array   {     val program = IO.forever  IO { "Hi again!" }          .flatMap { Console.println it  }     program   }  Note that this program blows the stack after a few thousand iterations. This is equiva- lent to the following: IO.forever  Console.println "Hi again!"      If you don’t see why it blows the stack, consider the following pseudo-code  which won’t  compile!  where the t variable in the forever function implementation is replaced by  the corresponding expression: fun   forever ioa: IO  : IO  {     return ioa.flatMap { { forever ioa  }   } }  Now  let’s  replace  the  recursive  call  with  the  corresponding  code  from  the  forever  function implementation: fun   forever ioa: IO  : IO  {     return ioa.flatMap { { ioa.flatMap { { forever  ioa  }   } }   } }  You  could  continue  forever  recursively.  What  you  might  notice  is  that  the  calls  to  flatMap would be nested, resulting in the current state being pushed onto the stack  with each call. That would indeed blow the stack after a few thousand steps. Unlike in  imperative code, where you execute one instruction after the other, you’re calling the  flatMap function recursively.  To make IO stack-safe, you can use a technique called trampolining. First, you’ll need   to represent three states of your program:  ¡	Return  represents  a  computation  that’s  finished,  meaning  that  you  need  to   return the result.   Fully functional input output     347  ¡	Suspend represents a suspended computation when some effect has to be applied   before resuming the current computation.  ¡	Continue represents a state where the program has to first apply a sub- computation   before continuing with the next one.  These states are represented by the three classes shown in the next listing.  NOTE    Listings 12.9 through 12.11 are parts of a whole. They aren’t supposed  to be used with the previous code, but together.  Listing 12.10    The three classes needed to make IO stack-safe  IO is now a sealed class in order to prevent  instantiation from the outside the class.  This function taking no argument applies  a  side  effect and returns a value.  sealed class IO  {    This value will be returned  by the computation.      internal     class Return  val value: A : IO          internal     class Suspend  val resume:    -> A : IO          internal     class Continue  val sub: IO ,                           val f:  A  ->  IO  : IO      The computation continues by applying  this function to the returned value.  This IO is executed first,  producing a value.  Some  modifications  must  be  made  to  the  enclosing  IO  class,  as  shown  in  listings  12.11and 12.12.

The following listing shows how you can use the new stack-safe version.

You  can also rewrite repeat to make it stack-safe. I won’t show the new implementation  here,  but  you’ll  find  it  in  the  accompanying  code   http:  github.com pysaumont  fpinkotlin .  Keep in mind that this isn’t the recommended way to write functional programs.  Take it as an example of what can be ultimately done, rather than as good practice. Also  note that “ultimately,” here, applies to Kotlin programming. With a more functional  friendly language, you can craft much more powerful programs.  Summary  ¡	Effects can be passed into List, Result, and other contexts to be safely applied to  values rather than extracting values from these contexts and applying the effects  outside, which might produce errors if there are no values.  ¡	Handling two different effects for success and failure can be abstracted inside the   Result type.  ¡	Reading from files is done in exactly the same way as reading from the console or   from memory through the Reader abstraction.  ¡	More functional input output can be obtained through the IO type. ¡	The IO type can be extended to a more generic type that makes it possible to  perform any imperative task in a functional way by building a program that’s  executed later.  ¡	The IO type can be made stack-safe by using a technique known as “trampolining.”   13Sharing mutable states   with actors  In this chapter ¡	Understanding the actor model ¡	Using asynchronous messaging ¡	Building an actor framework ¡	Putting actors to work ¡	Optimizing actor performance  In the previous chapters, you learned many techniques to help you write safer pro- grams. Most of these techniques come from functional programming. One of these techniques consist in using immutable data to avoid state mutations. Programs with- out mutable states are safer, more reliable, and easier to design and scale.  You learned how mutable states can be handled in a functional way by passing the state along as an argument to functions. You saw several examples of this technique. You learned to generate streams of data by passing the state of a generator together with each new value.  If you don’t remember this, review exercise 9.29 where you implemented the function by passing along each generated value together with the new state of the generator.  In chapter 12, you also learned how to pass the console as a parameter to send output to the screen and receive input from the key- board. These techniques can be widely applied to many domains. But this is often    unfold  351                           352  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  understood  to  mean  that  functional  programming  techniques  help  to  safely  share  mutable state. This is completely wrong.  Using immutable data structures, for example, doesn’t help with sharing mutable  state. It prevents unintentional sharing of a mutable state by removing state mutation.  Passing the state as part of a function parameter and returning a new  immutable  state  as part of the result  in the form of a pair containing both the result and the new state   is perfectly fine when dealing with a single thread. But as long as you need to share  state mutation between threads, which is pretty much always the case in modern appli- cations, immutable data structures don’t help. To share this kind of data, one needs a  mutable reference to it so that the new immutable data can replace the previous one.  Imagine you want to count how many times a function is called. In a single-threaded  application, you might do this by adding the counter to the function argument and  returning the incremented counter as part of the result. But most imperative program- mers would rather increment the counter as a side effect. This would work seamlessly  because there’s only a single thread, so no locking is necessary to prevent potential con- current access. This is the same as living on a desert island. If you’re the only inhabitant,  there’s no need for locks on your doors. But in a multithreaded program, how can you  increment the counter in a safe way, avoiding concurrent access? The answer is gener- ally to use locks or to make operations atomic, or both.  In functional programming, sharing resources has to be done as an effect, which  means, more or less, that each time you access a shared resource, you have to leave func- tional safety and treat this access as you did for input output  I O  in chapter 12. Does  this mean that you must then manage locks and synchronization each time you need to  share a mutable state? Not at all.  As you learned in the previous chapters, functional programming is also about push- ing abstraction to the limit. Sharing a mutable state can be abstracted in such a way that  you can use it without bothering about the details. One way to achieve this is to use an  actor framework.  In this chapter, you’re not going to develop a real, complete actor framework. Creat- ing a complete actor framework is such a tremendous job that you should rather use an  existing one. Here you’ll develop a minimal actor framework that gives you the feeling  of what an actor framework brings to functional programming.  13.1  The actor model  In the actor model, a multithreaded application is divided into single-threaded com- ponents, called actors. If each actor is single-threaded, it doesn’t need to share data  using locks or synchronization.  Actors communicate with other actors by way of effects, as if such communication  were the I O of messages. This means that actors rely on a mechanism for serializing  the messages they receive.  Here, serialization means handling one message after the  other. This isn’t to be confused with object serialization.  Due to this mechanism, actors  can process messages one at a time without having to bother about concurrent access    13.1.1      13.1.2  13.1.3    The actor model     353  to their internal resources. As a result, an actor system can be seen as a series of func- tional programs communicating with each other through effects. Each actor can be single-threaded, so there’s no concurrent access to resources inside. Concurrency is abstracted inside the framework.  Understanding asynchronous messaging part of the message processing, actors can send messages to other actors. Messages As asynchronously, which means an actor doesn’t need to wait for an answer—there are sent isn’t one. As soon as a message is sent, the sender can continue its job, which mostly consists of processing one at a time a queue of messages it receives. Handling the mes- sage queue means that there needs to be some concurrent accesses to the queue. But this management is abstracted in the actor framework so you, the programmer, don’t need to worry about this.  Answers to messages might be needed in some cases. Suppose an actor is responsible for a long computation. The client can take advantage of asynchronous communica- tion by continuing its own job while the computation is handled for it. But once the computation is done, there must be a way for the client to receive the result. This is done by making the actor responsible for the computation callback its client and send it the result, once again in an asynchronous way. Note that the client can be the original sender, though that need not always be the case.  Handling parallelization The actor model allows tasks to be parallelized by using a manager actor that’s respon- sible for breaking the task into subtasks and distributing them to a number of worker actors. Each time a worker actor returns a result to the manager, it’s given a new sub- task.  no worker actor is ever idle until the list of subtasks is empty. The downside is that the manager actor doesn’t participate in the computation. But in a real application, this generally makes no noticeable difference.  parallelization   advantage   models   model   offers   other   This   over   that   an   in   the   For   tasks,   some   results   they’re received. In such a case, the manager actor will probably send the results to a specific actor responsible for this job. You’ll see an example of this in section 13.3. In small programs, the manager itself can handle this task. In figure 13.1, this actor is called the Receiver actor.  reordered   subtasks   when   need   may   the   be   of   to   Handling actor state mutation Actors can be stateless  immutable  or stateful, meaning they’re supposed to change their state according to the messages they receive. For example, a synchronizer actor can receive the results of computations that have to be reordered before being used.  Imagine, for example, that you have a list of data that must go through heavy compu- tation in order to provide a list of results. In short, this is a mapping. It could be paral- lelized by breaking the list into several sublists and giving these sublists to worker actors for processing. But there’s no guarantee that the worker actors will finish their jobs in the same order that those jobs were given to them.                                                                                                                                     354  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  Send main  task.

Receiver  actor  Worker actor  Worker actor  Worker actor  Figure 13.1    The main actor produces the main task and sends it to the manager,  which splits it into subtasks that are processed in parallel by several worker actors.  Subresults are sent back to the manager, which passes them to the receiver. After  collating the subresults, the receiver sends the final result to the main actor.  One solution for resynchronizing the results is to number the tasks. When a worker  sends back the result, it adds the corresponding task number so that the receiver can  put the results in a priority queue. Not only does this allow automatic sorting, but it  also makes it possible to process the results as an asynchronous stream. Each time the  receiver  receives  a  result,  it  compares  the  task  number  to  the  expected  number.  If  there’s a match, it passes the result to the client and then looks into the priority queue to  see if the first available result corresponds to the new expected task number. If there’s a  match, the dequeuing process continues until there’s no longer a match. If the received  result doesn’t match the expected result number, it’s added to the priority queue.  In such a design, the receiving actor has to handle two mutable pieces of data: the  priority queue and the expected result number. Does this mean the actor has to use  mutable properties? This wouldn’t be a big deal but, because actors are single-threaded,  it’s not necessary. As you’ll see, the handling of property mutations can be included and  abstracted into a general state-mutation process, allowing the programmer to use only  immutable data.  13.2  An actor framework implementation  In this section, you’ll learn how to build a minimal but fully functional actor frame- work. While building this framework, you’ll learn how an actor framework allows for  safe sharing of mutable state, easy and secure parallelization and reserialization, and  modular architecture of applications.

Most actor frameworks allow remote actors to be handled in a transparent way, meaning that you can use actors that are running on different machines without having to care about communication. This makes actor frameworks an ideal way to build scalable applica- tions. I won’t deal with this aspect in this book.    13.2.2  you need to define the interfaces that will constitute your actor framework. The interface that defines several functions. Here’s the main  Actor  Designing the actor framework interfaces First most important is the function of this interface: fun tell message: T, sender: Result >      this  This function is used to send a message to actor  meaning the actor holding the function . This means that to send a message to an actor, you must have a reference to it.  This is different from real actor frameworks in which messages aren’t sent to actors but to actor references, proxies, or some other substitute.

This code isn’t intended to use the results of the exercises from previous   chapters but, rather, the module that’s available in the code accom- fpinkotlin-common panying this book  https:  github.com pysaumont fpinkotlin . This is mostly the same code as the solutions to the exercises, but with some additional functions.                                                                                                                                                                               356  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  Listing 13.1    The Actor interface  The context property function lets you  access the actor context.  interface Actor  {  The self function returns a  Result of this actor.      val context: ActorContext        fun self  : Result > = Result this        fun tell message: T, sender: Result > =self          fun shutdown         fun tell message: T, sender: Actor   =                         tell message, Result sender         companion object {  The sender argument  defaults to self   in order  to simplify sending  messages without having  to indicate the sender.  This is a convenience function  that sends a message with an  actor reference instead of a  Result .         fun   noSender  : Result > = Result        } }  The noSender function is a helper  function to provide a Result.Empty with  the Result  type.  The shutdown function tells the actor that it should  terminate itself. In your minimal framework, it cleanly  terminates the actor thread.  The  following  listing  shows  the  two  other  necessary  interfaces:  ActorContext  and  MessageProcessor.  Listing 13.2    The ActorContext and MessageProcessor interfaces  Allows access to the actor’s behavior  interface ActorContext  {      fun behavior  : MessageProcessor        fun become behavior: MessageProcessor    }  interface MessageProcessor  {      fun process message: T,                 sender: Result >   }  Allows an actor to change  its behavior by registering  a new MessageProcessor  The MessageProcessor interface has  only one function, which represents  the processing of one message.  The most important element here is the ActorContext interface. The become function  allows an actor to change its behavior, meaning the way it processes messages. As you  can see, the behavior of an actor looks like an effect, taking as its argument a pair com- posed of the message to process and the sender.   The AbstractActor implementation     357  During the life of the application, the behavior of each actor is allowed to change.  Generally this change of behavior is caused by a modification to the state of the actor,  replacing the original behavior with a new one. This will be clearer once you see the  implementation.  13.3  The AbstractActor implementation  The AbstractActor implementation represents the part of an actor implementation  that’s common to all actors. All the message management operations are common and  are provided by the actor framework, so that you’ll only have to implement the busi- ness part. The following listing shows the AbstractActor implementation.  Listing 13.3    The AbstractActor implementation  abstract class AbstractActor  protected val id: String  : Actor  {  Initializes the context  property to a new  ActorContext      override val context: ActorContext  =                             object: ActorContext  {           var behavior: MessageProcessor  =                         object: MessageProcessor  {   Delegates the default  behavior to the  onReceived function              override fun process message: T, sender: Result >  {                 onReceive message, sender              }         }          @Synchronized         override         fun become behavior: MessageProcessor   {              this.behavior = behavior         }          override fun behavior   = behavior     }  Initializes the underlying  ExecutorService      private val executor: ExecutorService =              Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor DaemonThreadFactory         abstract fun onReceive message: T,                            sender: Result >    To change its behavior, the  ActorContext registers the  new behavior. This is where  the mutation occurs, but it’s  hidden by the framework.      override fun self  : Result > {         return Result this      }  Holds the business  processing, implemented  by the user of the API      override fun shutdown   {         this.executor.shutdown       }      @Synchronized     override fun tell message: T,                       sender: Result >  {   The tell function is how an actor  receives a message. It’s synchronized  to ensure that messages are  processed one at a time.   358  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  When a message is received, it’s  processed by the current behavior  returned by the actor context.          executor.execute {             try {                 context.behavior                          .process message, sender               } catch  e: RejectedExecutionException  {                  *                  * This is probably normal and means all pending tasks                  * were canceled because the actor was stopped.                  *              } catch  e: Exception  {                 throw RuntimeException e              }         }     } }  The  ExecutorService  is  initialized  with  a  single-thread  executor  using  a  daemon  thread factory to allow automatic shutdown when the main thread terminates. Also  note that when the ExecutorService is initialized, the DaemonThreadFactory creates  daemon threads so that actors don’t prevent the application from stopping when the  main thread stops.  You’ll find the corresponding code in the repository for this book.  Your actor framework is now complete, though as I mentioned before, this isn’t pro- duction code. This is a minimal example to show you how an actor framework might  work.  13.4  Putting actors to work  Now that you’ve an actor framework at your disposal, it’s time to apply it to some con- crete problems. Actors are useful when multiple threads are supposed to share some  mutable state, as when a thread produces the result of a computation, and this result  must be passed to another thread for further processing.  Usually, such mutable state sharing is done by storing values in shared mutable prop- erties, which implies locking and synchronization. You’ll first try a minimal actor exam- ple, which can be considered as the “Hello, World!” of actors. You’ll then build a more  complete application where an actor is used to distribute tasks to other actors working  in parallel.  The first example is the traditional example that’s used to test actors. It consists of  two ping-pong players and a referee. The game starts when the ball, represented by an  integer, is given to one player. Each player then sends the ball to the other until this hap- pens ten times, at which point, the ball is given back to the referee.  13.4.1  Implementing the Ping Pong example  First you’ll implement the referee. All you need to do is to create an actor, implement- ing its onReceive function. In this function, you’ll display a message as shown in the  next listing.   Putting actors to work     359  Listing 13.4    Creating the referee object  val referee = object : AbstractActor  "Referee"  {     override fun onReceive message: Int, sender: Result >  {         println "Game ended after $message shots"      } }  Next you’ll create the two players. As there are two instances, you have two options.  The object approach is to create Player class as shown in the following listing.  Listing 13.5    The Player class  The class is private because it’s defined at package level.  You could also define it as a local class, inside the main  function of the program.  Each player is created with a reference to the  referee so that a player can give the ball back  to the referee when the game is over. This  wouldn’t be necessary if the Player class was  defined locally in the same function as the  referee  for example, in the main function .  private class Player id: String,               private val sound: String,               private val referee: Actor  :                             AbstractActor  id  {   The Sound string  is a message  that’s displayed  by the players  when they receive  the ball  either  Ping or Pong .      override fun onReceive message: Int, sender: Result >  {         println "$sound - $message"           if  message >= 10  {             referee.tell message, sender           } else {             sender.forEach                  { actor: Actor  ->                       actor.tell message + 1, self                    },                 { referee.tell message, sender  }                        }     } }  If the other player isn’t present,  registers an issue with the referee.  This is the business part of the  actor, meaning the part that does  what the user expects to see.  If the game is over, gives the  ball back to the referee.  Otherwise, sends it  back to the other  player if present.  If you prefer the functional way, you can create a function returning an Actor as shown  in the following listing.  Listing 13.6    The player function  The Sound string is a message that’s displayed by the  players when they receive the ball  either Ping or Pong .  fun player id: String,            sound: String,             referee: Actor   =                 object : AbstractActor  "id"  {   Creates each player with a reference to the  referee so that a player can give the ball back  to the referee when the game is over  If the game is  over, gives the  ball back to the  referee      override fun onReceive message: Int, sender: Result >  {         println "$sound - $message"           if  message >= 10  {             referee.tell message, sender           } else {  This is the business   part of the actor.   360  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  Otherwise, send it  back to the other  player if present.              sender.forEach                  { actor: Actor  ->                       actor.tell message + 1, self                    },                 { referee.tell message, sender  }                                      }     } }  If the other player isn’t present,  registers an issue with the referee  As you can see, these two solution are nearly identical, showing that objects are indeed  functions.  With the player function created  or the Player class , you can finalize your pro- gram. But you need a way to keep the application running until the game is over. With- out this, the main application thread terminates as soon as the game is started, and  the players won’t be given the opportunity to play their game. This can be achieved  through the use of a semaphore, as shown in the next listing.  Listing 13.7    The Ping Pong example  A semaphore is created with one permit.  private val semaphore = Semaphore 1    fun main args: Array   {     val referee = object : AbstractActor  "Referee"  {  When the game is over, the semaphore is  released, making one new permit available  that allows the main thread to resume.          override fun onReceive message: Int, sender: Result >  {             println "Game ended after $message shots"              semaphore.release            }     }      val player1 =         player "Player1", "Ping", referee       val player2 = player "Player2", "Pong", referee   If you preferred to define a Player class,  the only difference will be the capitalized  Player instead of player.  The single available permit is  acquired by the current thread,  and the game is started.      semaphore.acquire        player1.tell 1, Result player2       semaphore.acquire           main thread terminates }  When resuming, the main thread terminates. All actor  threads are daemons, so they also stop automatically.  This program displays the following output: Ping - 1 Pong - 2 Ping - 3 Pong - 4 Ping - 5  The main thread tries to acquire a new  permit. As none are available, it blocks  until the semaphore is released.   Putting actors to work     361  Pong - 6 Ping - 7 Pong - 8 Ping - 9 Pong - 10 Game ended after 10 shots  13.4.2  Running a computation in parallel  It’s now time to look at a more serious example of the actor model in action: running  a computation in parallel. To simulate a long-running computation, you’ll choose a  list of random numbers between 0 and 30, and compute the corresponding Fibonacci  value using a slow algorithm.  The application is composed of three kinds of actors: a Manager, in charge of cre- ating  a  given  number  of  worker  actors  and  distributing  the  tasks  to  them;  several  instances of workers; and a client, which is implemented in the main program class  as an anonymous actor. The following listing shows the simplest of these classes, the  Worker actor.  Listing 13.8    The Worker actor in charge of running parts of the computation  class Worker id: String  : AbstractActor  id  {      override fun onReceive message: Int, sender: Result >  {         sender.forEach  onSuccess = { a: Actor  ->                 a.tell slowFibonacci message , self                 }      }      private fun slowFibonacci number: Int : Int {         return when  number  {             0    -> 1             1    -> 1             else -> slowFibonacci number - 1                  + slowFibonacci number - 2           }     } }  As you can see, this actor is stateless. It computes the result and sends it back to the  sender to which it has received a reference. This might be a different actor than the  caller.  As the numbers are chosen randomly between 0 and 35, the time needed to com- pute the result is variable. This listing simulates tasks that take variable amounts of time  to execute. Unlike the example of automatic parallelization in chapter 8, all threads  actors are kept busy until the whole computation is finished.  The Manager class is a bit more complicated. The following listing shows the con-  structor of the class and the properties that are initialized.  When the Worker  receives a number, it  reacts by computing the  corresponding Fibonacci  value and sending it back  to the caller.  An inefficient algorithm is used on  purpose to create long-lasting tasks.   362  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  Listing 13.9    The constructor and properties of the Manager class  The Manager stores the references to its client, to which  it will send the result of the computation.  The number of workers  to use is stored.  class Manager id: String, list: List ,   private val client: Actor >>,    private val workers: Int  : AbstractActor  id  {   The resultList  holds the results  of the  computations.      private val initial: List >      private val workList: List       private val resultList: List       private val managerFunction:          Manager  ->  Behavior  ->  Int  -> Unit   The managerFunction is the heart of the   Manager, determining what it will be able to do.  This function is applied each time the manager  receives a result from a worker.  The list of values to be processed is  split at the number of workers in  order to obtain a list of initial tasks  and a list of remaining tasks.      init {       val splitLists = list.splitAt this.workers         this.initial =                 splitLists.first.zipWithPosition          this.workList = splitLists.second        this.resultList = List     The workList is  set to the  remaining tasks.  The resultList is  initialized to an  empty list.  The initial list is a list of a  pair of integers, holding  both the number to  process  .first  and   the position in the list    .second .  The workList is the list of tasks  remaining to be executed once  all worker actors have been  given their first task.  The list of initial tasks   numbers for which the  Fibonacci value will be  computed  is zipped with the  position of its elements. The  position  numbers from 0 to  n  are only used to name the  worker actors from 0 to n.  The manager function, representing the  work of the manager, is a curried  function of the manager itself, its  behavior, and the received message  i ,  which will be the result of a subtask.        managerFunction = { manager ->          { behavior ->             { i ->                 val result =                   behavior.resultList.cons i   When a result is received,                  if  result.length == list.length  { it’s added to the list of                    this.client.tell Result result    results, which is fetched                  } else { from the manager’s                    manager.context behavior.                     .become Behavior behavior.workList                                                .tailSafe                                                .getOrElse List   , result                   }             }         }       }     }     ...  Otherwise, the become function of the context is called  to change the behavior of the Manager. This change of  behavior is a change of state. The new behavior is  created with the tail of the workList and the current list  of results  to which the received value has been added .  If the resultList length is equal  to the input list length, the  computation finishes, so the  result is sent to the client.  As you can see, if the computation is finished, the result is added to the result list and sent to the client. Otherwise, the result is added to the current result list. In traditional programming, this would be done by mutating the list of results that would be held by the  Manager. This is exactly what happens here, except for two differences:  ¡  ¡  The list of results is stored in the behavior. Neither the behavior nor the list are mutated. Instead, a new behavior is cre- ated and the context is mutated to hold the new behavior as a replacement for               Putting actors to work     363  the old one. But you don’t have to deal with this mutation. As far as you’re con- cerned, everything is immutable because the mutation is abstracted by the actor  framework.  The  following  listing  shows  the  Behavior  class  implemented  as  an  inner  class.  The  Behavior inner class allows you to abstract the actor mutation.  Listing 13.10    The Behavior inner class  The Behavior is constructed with the workList  from  which the head has been removed prior to calling the  constructor  and the resultList  to which a result has  been added .  The process function, which is called on reception of a  message, first applies the managerFunction to the  received message. Then it sends the next task  the head  of the workList  to the sender  a Worker actor that will  process it  or, if the workList is empty, it instructs the  worker actor to shut down.  internal inner class Behavior     internal constructor          internal val workList: List ,          internal val resultList: List   : MessageProcessor  {      override fun process message: Int,                          sender: Result >  {          managerFunction this@Manager  this@Behavior  message          sender.forEach onSuccess = { a: Actor  ->             workList.headSafe                       .forEach { a.tell it, self    }  { a.shutdown   }         }      } }  That covers the main parts of the Manager. The rest is composed of utility functions  that are mainly used for starting the work. The next listing shows these functions.  Listing 13.11    The utility functions of the Manager  class Manager id: String, list: List , . . .      . . .  In order to start, the Manager sends a  message to itself. What the message is  makes no difference, because the  behavior has yet to be initialized.  The workers are then  created and initialized.      fun start   {         onReceive 0, self             sequence initial.map { this.initWorker it  }              .forEach onSuccess = { this.initWorkers it  },                      onFailure =                           { this.tellClientEmptyResult                                  it.message ?: "Unknown error"  }      }      private fun initWorker t: Pair  :                             Result  Unit> =          Result { Worker "Worker " + t.second .tell t.first, self    }   This function creates a  function of type    -> Unit  creating a worker actor.  This function  executes the  actor creation.      private fun initWorkers lst: List  Unit>  {         lst.forEach { it   }      }   364  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors      private     fun tellClientEmptyResult string: String  {          client.tell Result.failure "$string caused by empty input list."       }  If there was an error,  the client is informed.      override fun onReceive message: Int,                          sender: Result >  {          context.become Behavior workList, resultList       }      . . . }  This is the initial behavior of the Manager. As part of its  initialization, it switches behavior, starting with the workList  containing the remaining tasks and the empty resultList.  It’s important to understand that the onReceive function represents what the actor  will do when it receives its first message. This function won’t be called when the work- ers send their results to the manager.  The last part of the program is shown in listing 13.12. This represents the client code  for the application. But unlike the Manager and the Worker, it’s not an actor. Instead,  the main function uses an actor. This is an implementation choice. There’s no specific  reason for choosing one solution or the other. But a client actor is necessary in order to  receive the result.  Listing 13.12    The client application  import com.fpinkotlin.common.List import com.fpinkotlin.common.Result import com.fpinkotlin.common.range import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore  private val semaphore = Semaphore 1   private const val listLength = 20_000  private const val workers = 8  private val rnd = java.util.Random 0  private val testList =      range 0, listLength .map { rnd.nextInt 35  }  A semaphore is created to allow the main  thread to wait for the actors to complete  their work.  The number of tasks is initialized.  The number of worker actors is set here.  The list of tasks is created by randomly  generating numbers between 0 and 35.  The semaphore is acquired  when the program starts.  A client actor is created as an  anonymous singelton object.  fun main args: Array   {     semaphore.acquire        val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis       val client =          object: AbstractActor >> "Client"  {             override fun onReceive message: Result >,                           sender: Result >>>  {                message.forEach { processSuccess it  },                           { processFailure it.message ?: "Unknown error"  }                 println "Total time: "                     +  System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime                  semaphore.release                }         }  The only responsibility of the client is to  process the result or any occurring error.  The client releases the  semaphore when it  receives the result.   Putting actors to work     365      val manager =          Manager "Manager", testList, client, workers      manager.start       semaphore.acquire    }  The semaphore is acquired again to wait  for the job to finish.  The manager is  instantiated and  started.  private fun processFailure message: String  {     println message  }  fun processSuccess lst: List   {     println "Input: ${testList.splitAt 40 .first}"      println "Result: ${lst.splitAt 40 .first}"  }  You can run this program with various lengths for the list of tasks and various numbers  of worker actors. On my eight-core Linux box, running with a task length of 20,000  gives the following results:  ¡	One worker actor: 73 sec ¡	Two worker actors: 37 sec ¡	Four worker actors: 19 sec ¡	Eight worker actors: 12 sec ¡	Sixteen worker actors: 12 sec  These figures aren’t precise, but they show that using a number of threads higher than  the number of available cores is useless. The result displayed by the program is as fol- lows  only the first 11 results are displayed : Input: [5, 23, 4, 2, 25, 28, 16, 1, 34, 9, 22, ..., NIL] Result: [8, 5, 2, 1597, 46368, 121393, 2, 55, 28657, 1, 2, ..., NIL] Total time: 12558  As you can see, there’s a problem!  13.4.3  Reordering the results  As you may have noticed, the result isn’t correct. This is obvious when looking at the  second random value  23  and at the corresponding result  5 . You can also compare  the  following  values  and  results.  If  you  run  the  program  on  your  computer,  you’ll  obtain different results for each run.  What’s happening here is that not all tasks take the same amount of time to execute.  I deliberately set the computation to perform this way, so that some tasks  computa- tions for low argument values  return quickly, while others  computations for higher  values  take much longer. As a result, the returned values aren’t in the correct order.  To fix this problem, you need to sort the results in the same order as their cor- responding arguments. One solution is to use the Heap data type you developed in  chapter 11. You can number each task and use this number as the priority in a priority  queue.   366  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  The first thing you need to change is the type of the worker actors. Instead of work- ing on integers, they’ll need to work on tuples of integers: one integer representing  the argument of the computation and one representing the number of the task. The  following listing shows the corresponding changes in the Worker class.  Listing 13.13    The Worker actor keeping track of the task number  class Worker id: String  :     AbstractActor > id  {   The return message  is changed to include  the task number.      override fun onReceive message: Pair ,               sender: Result >>  {          sender.forEach onSuccess =           { a: Actor > ->             a.tell Pair slowFibonacci message.first ,                          message.second  , self              }      }   ... }  The type parameter is changed  from Int to Pair .  The signature of the onReceive  function is changed to reflect  the new actor type.  The task number is the second element of the tuple. This isn’t easy to read, given that  the task number and the argument of the computation are of the same type  Int . In  real life, this shouldn’t happen because you should be using a specific type for the task.  But if you prefer, you can also use a specific type instead of Pair to wrap both the task  and the task number, such as a Task type with a number property.  Changes in the Manager class are more numerous. You need to change the type of   the class and the types of the workList and result properties: class Manager id: String, list: List ,            private val client: Actor >>,            private val workers: Int  : AbstractActor > id  {      private val initial: List >     private val workList: List >     private val resultHeap: Heap >     private val managerFunction:  Manager  ->  Behavior  ->  Int  -> Unit  These properties are initialized in the constructor as follows: init {     val splitLists = list.zipWithPosition  .splitAt this.workers      this.initial = splitLists.first     this.workList = splitLists.second     this.resultHeap = Heap Comparator {           p1: Pair , p2: Pair  ->                                     p1.second.compareTo p2.second      }   The workList now contains pairs  as was the case for the initial list in the former  example , and the result is a priority queue  Heap  of pairs. This Heap is initialized with  a Comparator based on the comparison of the second element of the pairs.   The type of the workList is now  List >.  Putting actors to work     367  Using a Task type that wraps both the task and the task number would have allowed  you to make this type Comparable, so that a Comparator would have been useless.  I  leave this optimization as an exercise for you.  The managerFunction is different too: private val managerFunction:                  Manager  ->  Behavior  ->  Pair   -> Unit  The received result is now  inserted into the Heap.  It’s initialized in the constructor like this: managerFunction = { manager ->     { behavior ->         { p ->             val result = behavior.resultHeap + p              if  result.size == list.length  {                 this.client.tell Result result.toList                               .map { it.first }                } else {                 ...             }         }     } }  Once the computation is complete,  the Heap is converted into a list  before being returned to the client.  The Behavior inner class must be changed to reflect the actor type change:  internal inner class Behavior     internal     constructor internal                 val workList: List >,         internal val resultHeap: Heap > :                      MessageProcessor > {   The type of the result is now  Heap >.      override     fun process message: Pair ,                 sender: Result >>  {          managerFunction this@Manager  this@Behavior  message          sender.forEach onSuccess = { a: Actor > ->             workList.headSafe                       .forEach { a.tell it, self    }  { a.shutdown   }         }      } }  The signature of the process function is modified to  reflect the change of parameter type.  The type parameter of   the Behavior class is   now Pair .  You still need to apply some minor changes to the rest of the Manager class. The start  function must be modified: fun start   {     onReceive Pair 0, 0 , self      The type of the start message must match the  type parameter of the Manager actor.  sequence initial.map { this.initWorker it  }   .forEach { this.initWorkers it  },  { this.tellClientEmptyResult   it.message ?: "Unknown error"  }   }   368  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  The Worker initialization process is slightly different too: private fun initWorker t: Pair  : Result  Unit> =     Result { Worker "Worker " + t.second                      .tell Pair t.first, t.second , self    }   Last, the onReceive function is modified: override fun onReceive message: Pair ,                        sender: Result >>  {     context.become Behavior workList, resultHeap   }  Now the results are displayed in the correct order.  13.4.4  Optimizing performance  Although it works fine, this example is far from optimal. The main reason is that all  results are put in the resulting priority queue in order to have them sorted. As I said in  chapter 11, this isn’t the right use case for a priority queue.  A priority queue is designed for putting elements that must be processed in a given  order  according to their priority . Elements are supposed to be consumed as they are  produced, insuring that the queue never holds more than a few elements at a time. In  the present case, elements should be stored only as long as higher-priority elements  exist that haven’t yet been processed. This isn’t the only use case of a priority queue, but  it’s a perfect one.  To see the problem in practice, try replacing the slowFibonnacci function in the   Worker class with an efficient one, such as private fun fibonacci number: Int : Int {     tailrec fun fibonacci acc1: Int, acc2: Int, x: Int : Int = when  x  {         0 -> 1  1 -> acc1 + acc2 else -> fibonacci acc2, acc1 + acc2, x - 1   } return fibonacci 0, 1, number   }  In the client program, set to 500,000, and then try the program with 1, 2, 4, or 8 actors  if your computer has enough cores . Here’s an example of the results I get: 1 actor: 40567 ms 2 actors: 24399 ms 4 actors: 22394 ms 8 actors: 22389 ms  listLength  You might notice an interesting thing here: when the tasks are short, the benefit of hav- ing several concurrent actors is much lower. Typically, there’s a gain when going from one to two actors. Putting in more actors doesn’t bring more performance. It might not be obvious because these figures are dependent on the computer used, but they’re quite    testList from the println testList.map { fibonacci it  }.splitAt 40 .first   WorkersExample  comparison,   following   program:  reusing   code,   slow.   you   can   use   the   the  As   a   This executes in 700 ms, which is about 30 times faster than the actor version using 2, 4, or 8 actors. One reason for this is the bottleneck caused by the data  Heap. The  Heap                                                   Putting actors to work     369  structure isn’t meant for sorting. It provides good performance as long as the number  of elements is kept low, but here we’re inserting all 200,000 results into the heap, sort- ing the full data set on each insertion. This isn’t efficient.  Obviously, this inefficiency isn’t an implementation problem, but a problem with  using the wrong tool for the job. You’d get much better performance by storing all  results and sorting them once when the computation is over, though you’d need to use  the right tool for sorting.  Another option is to change the design of the program. One of the problems with  the current design is that not only does insertion into the Heap take a long time, but it’s  done by the Manager thread. Instead of distributing tasks to the worker actors as soon  as they’ve finished a computation, the Manager makes them wait until it has finished  the insertion into the heap. One possible solution would be to use a separate actor for  inserting into the Heap.  But sometimes a better way to go is to use the right job for the tool. The fact that  you’re consuming the result synchronously might not be a requirement. If it isn’t, you’re  adding an implicit requirement that makes the problem harder to solve. One possibility  would be to pass the results individually to the client. This way, the Heap would be used  only when the results are out of order, preventing it from becoming too big.  This kind of use is how a priority queue is intended to be used. To take this into  account, you can add a Receiver actor to your program. The Receiver actor is shown  in the following listing.  Listing 13.14    The Receiver actor in charge of receiving the results asynchronously  import com.fpinkotlin.common.List import com.fpinkotlin.common.Result  The Receiver class is an actor parameterized  by the type of data it’s meant to receive: Int.  class Receiver id: String,                private val client: Actor > :                                AbstractActor  id  {       private val receiverFunction:  Receiver  ->  Behavior  ->  Int  -> Unit  The Receiver client is an  actor parameterized by  the type List .  Otherwise, it changes its behavior by  adding the result to the result list.     init {         receiverFunction = { receiver ->               { behavior ->                 { i ->                     if  i == -1  {                         this.client.tell behavior.resultList.reverse                            shutdown                       } else {                         receiver.context                              .become Behavior behavior.resultList.cons i                        }  The Receiver function receives an Int.   If it’s –1, meaning the computation is  complete, it sends the result to its client  and shuts itself down.  }  }  }  }  override fun onReceive i: Int, sender: Result >  {   370  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors          context.become Behavior List i        }     internal inner class Behavior internal constructor          internal val resultList: List   :                            MessageProcessor  {          override fun process i: Int, sender: Result >  {             receiverFunction this@Receiver  this@Behavior  i          }    } }  The initial onReceive implementation consists of  replacing the actor behavior with one that uses a new  list containing the first result.  The behavior holds the current  list of results.  The  main  program   WorkersExample.kt   isn’t  much  different  from  the  previous  example. The only difference is the addition of the Receiver: fun main args: Array   {     semaphore.acquire       val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis       val client =         object: AbstractActor > "Client"  {             override fun onReceive message: List ,                           sender: Result >>  {                 println "Total time: "                         +  System.currentTimeMillis   - startTime                   println "Input: ${testList.splitAt 40 .first}"                  println "Result: ${message.splitAt 40 .first}"                  semaphore.release               }         }      val receiver = Receiver "Receiver", client       val manager =        Manager "Manager", testList, receiver, workers       manager.start       semaphore.acquire   }  The Receiver is created with  the main actor as its client.  The Manager is now created  with the Receiver as its client.  The Worker actor is exactly the same as in the previous example. This leaves us with the  Manager class holding the most important changes. The first change is that the Man- ager will have a client of type Actor  and will keep track of the length of the list  of tasks: class Manager              id: String, list: List ,             private val client: Actor ,              private val workers: Int  : AbstractActor > id  {  The Manager has a  client of type  Actor .      private val initial: List >     private val workList: List >     private val resultHeap: Heap >   Putting actors to work     371      private val managerFunction:  Manager  ->  Behavior  ->  Pair     -> Unit      private val limit: Int   The manager keeps track of the  length of the list of tasks.  The Receiver client now receives results asynchronously, one by one. The manager- Function is different: managerFunction = { manager ->     { behavior ->         { p ->             val result =                streamResult behavior.resultHeap + p,                             behavior.expected, List                 result.third.forEach { client.tell it  }             if  result.second > limit  {                 this.client.tell -1               } else {                 manager.context                     .become Behavior behavior.workList                          .tailSafe                            .getOrElse List   , result.first, result.second               }         }     } }  Calling the  streamResult  function  Sending the  termination code  This function now calls the streamResult function, returning a Triple. The first ele- ment is the Heap of results to which the received result has been added. The second  element is the next expected result number, and the third element is a list of results  that are in expected order. If all the tasks have been executed, the client is sent a spe- cial termination code. As you can see, most of the work is done in the streamResult  function: private fun streamResult result: Heap >,                          expected: Int, list: List  :               Triple >, Int, List > {     val triple = Triple result, expected, list      val temp = result.head         .flatMap { head ->              result.tail  .map { tail ->                  if  head.second == expected                       streamResult tail, expected + 1, list.cons head.first                    else                      triple              }          }     return temp.getOrElse triple  }  The streamResult function takes as its argument the Heap of results, the next expected  task number, and a list of integers that’s initially empty:   372  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  ¡	If the head of the result heap is different from the expected task result number,   nothing needs to be done, and the three parameters are returned as a Triple.  ¡	If  the  head  of  the  result  heap  matches  the  expected  task  result  number,  it’s  removed from the heap and added to the list. Then the function is called recur- sively  until  the  head  no  longer  matches,  constructing  a  list  of  the  results  in  expected order, leaving the others in the heap.  By processing this way, the heap is always kept small. For example, when computing  200,000 tasks, the maximal size of the heap was found to be 121. It was over 100 on 12  occasions, and more than 95% of the time it was less than 2. Figure 13.2 shows the over- all process of receiving the results from the Managers point of view.  No  Store in Heap  All results received?  Yes  End  Waiting for  results  Receive a result  Is it the expected result?  Yes  Send to Client  Is next  expected result  in Heap?  No  Yes  Retrieve next result from  Heap  Figure 13.2    The Manager receives a result and  either stores it in the Heap  if it doesn’t correspond  to the expected number  or sends it to the client. In  the latter case, it then looks at the Heap to see if  the next expected result has already been received.   Putting actors to work     373  The onReceive function is different because on starting you’d expect result number 0: override fun onReceive message: Pair ,                        sender: Result >>  {     context.become Behavior workList, resultHeap, 0   }  The Behavior class must also be modified. It now holds the expected task number: internal inner class Behavior     internal constructor internal val workList: List >,                          internal val resultHeap: Heap >,                          internal val expected: Int  :                                         MessageProcessor > {    ...  The  last  change  is  in  the  Manager.start  function  because  the  client  is  now  an  Actor : fun start   {     onReceive Pair 0, 0 , self        sequence initial.map { this.initWorker it  }          .forEach { this.initWorkers it  },                  { client.tell -1  }  }  With these modifications, the application is much faster. For example, under the same  conditions as in the previous example, here are the times needed to process 1,000,000  numbers with one, two, four, and eight worker actors: 1 actor: 40567 ms 2 actors: 12251 ms 4 actors: 11055 ms 8 actors: 11043 ms  This process is obviously not as fast as mapping the fibonacci function to the list of  numbers. But remember that you switched to the fast version of the function. Paral- lelizing tasks doesn’t help with short tasks. But if you switch back to the slow version of  the function, the results are quite different  using a list of 200,000 numbers : simple mapping: 12 mn 46 s 1 actor: 12 mn 2 s 2 actors: 6 mn 2 s 4 actors: 3 mn 3 s 8 actors: 1 mn 40 s  Now you can see that parallelization using actors can dramatically boost performances  as soon as the tasks to run in parallel are long-lasting. This was only an example to show  how actors can be used. Solving this kind of problem is much better handled by other  means, such as automatic parallelization of lists  as you saw in chapter 8 .  The main use of actors isn’t for parallelization, but for the abstraction of sharing a  mutable state. In these examples, you used lists that were shared between tasks. With- out actors, you’d have had to synchronize access to the workList and resultHeap to    374  chapter 13  Sharing mutable states with actors  handle concurrency. Actors allow you to abstract synchronization and mutation in the  framework.  If you look at the business code you wrote  apart from the actor framework itself ,  you’ll find no mutable data, no need to care about synchronization, and no risks of  thread  starvation  or  deadlocks.  Although  they’re  effect-based   as  opposed  to  func- tional , actors provide a good way to make functional parts of your code work together,  sharing mutable state in an abstracted manner.  Your actor framework is minimal and isn’t intended to be used in any serious code.  For such uses with Kotlin, you can use one of the available actor frameworks for Java,  particularly Akka. Although Akka is written in Scala, it can be used in Kotlin programs  as well. When using Akka, you’ll never see a line of Scala code unless you want to. To  learn more about actors, and Akka in particular, refer to Raymond Roestenburg, Rob  Bakker, and Rob Williams’s book, Akka in Action  Manning, 2016 .

They can reuse it, because functions, unlike design patterns, are reusable code.  Functional programmers try to reduce each problem to a composition of previously implemented functions. This isn’t always possible, so they sometimes have to imple- ment new functions. But these new functions become part of their toolbox. The main difference here is that functional programmers are always seeking abstraction because abstraction is what makes functions reusable.  All programmers use libraries that offer more or less the same functionality: general- izing problems in a way that allows reusing code instead of reinventing the wheel each time a new problem needs solving. The difference is in the level of abstraction. Prema- ture abstraction is considered a sin in OO programming, whereas it’s one of the fun- damental tools of functional programming. Abstraction allows the programmer to not only reuse functions, but to better understand the true nature of the problems at hand. In this chapter, you’ll look at some common problems programmers have to solve in everyday professional life. You’ll see how you can approach those problems differ- ently using the functional paradigm. In addition to learning how to solve these everyday problems in a functional way, you’ll often need to use imperative code. But what’s the best approach to using such code with functional programs? We’ll start with an impera- tive program and modify it to make it more efficient and useful.  and   class   conditions,   conditions.

But as asser- tions can be disabled at runtime, you might want to prevent the program from running with assertions disabled by using the following: if  !Thread.currentThread  .javaClass.desiredAssertionStatus    {  throw RuntimeException "Asserts must be enabled!!!"   }  }                                                                                                             Assertions and data validation     377       If you’re running your code in some older versions of IntelliJ, assertions NOTE might be enabled by default. In such cases, you should explicitly disable asser- tions by using the parameter in your configuration in order to simulate normal execution. In this specific case, it’s simpler to write:  VM  -da  fun inverse x: Int : Double = when  x  {  0    -> throw IllegalArgumentException "div. By 0"  else -> 1.0   x  To be safe, the function should be transformed into a total function as follows: fun inverse x: Int : Result  = when  x  {  0    -> Result.failure "div. By 0"  else -> Result 1.0   x   The most generic form of assertion consists of testing an argument against a specific con- dition, returning a   Result.Success otherwise. Take the example of an class Person private constructor val id: Int,  if the condition isn’t matched and a  operator function for a  Result.Failure  invoke  Person  type:  val firstName: String, val lastName: String  {  companion object {  operator fun invoke id: Int?,  firstName: String?, lastName: String? : Person =  Person id, firstName, lastName   }  }  }  }  This function might be used with data extracted from a database: val person = Person rs.getInt "personId" ,  rs.getString "firstName" , rs.getString "lastName"    In such a case, you might want to validate the data before calling the function. For example, you might want to check that the ID is positive, and that the first and last names aren’t or empty and they start with an uppercase letter. In imperative pro- gramming, you could check this by testing each condition before calling the function through the use of assertion functions: class Person private constructor val id: Int,  null  val firstName: String, val lastName: String  {  companion object {  operator fun invoke id: Int?, firstName: String?, lastName: String?  =  Person assertPositive id, "null or negative id" ,  assertValidName firstName, "invalid first name" , assertValidName lastName, "invalid last name"                                             378  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally          private fun assertPositive i: Int?,                                    message: String : Int = when  i  {             null -> throw IllegalStateException message              else -> i         }          private fun assertValidName name: String?,                                     message: String : String = when {             name == null                  name.isEmpty                    name[0].toInt   < 65                  name[0].toInt   > 91 ->                                 throw IllegalStateException message              else -> name         }     } }  But if you want your programs to be safe, you shouldn’t throw exceptions. Rather, you  should use special contexts such as Result for error handling. This kind of validation  is abstracted into the Result type. All you need to do is to write the validating func- tions, which means you need to write functions and use function references. Generic  validation functions can be placed at package level like so: fun isPositive i: Int? : Boolean = i != null && i > 0  fun isValidName name: String? : Boolean =     name != null && name[0].toInt   >= 65 && name[0].toInt   <= 91  You can then validate the data: class Person private constructor val id: Int,                                  val firstName: String,                                  val lastName: String  {    companion object {     fun of id: Int, firstName: String, lastName: String  =       Result.of  ::isPositive, id, "Negative id" .flatMap { validId ->           Result.of ::isValidName, firstName, "Invalid first name"              .flatMap { validFirstName ->                 Result.of ::isValidName, lastName, "Invalid last name"                      .map { validLastName ->                         Person validId, validFirstName, validLastName                      }       }     }   } }  But you can also simplify things by abstracting more of the process into more general  functions: fun assertPositive i: Int, message: String : Result  =         Result.of ::isPositive, i, message    Assertions and data validation     379  fun assertValidName name: String, message: String : Result  =  Result.of ::isValidName, name, message   You can then create a fun of id: Int, firstName: String, lastName: String  =  as follows:  Person  assertPositive id, "Negative id"   .flatMap { validId ->  assertValidName firstName, "Invalid first name"   .flatMap { validFirstName ->  assertValidName lastName, "Invalid last name"   .map { validLastName ->  Person validId, validFirstName, validLastName   }  }  }  The following listing shows some examples of validating functions.

Not succeeding generally means throwing an exception. But retrying a function  when an exception is thrown is tedious and error-prone.  Imagine you’re reading a value from some device that might throw an IOException  if the device isn’t ready. You might want to retry three times with a delay of 100 ms  between each retry. The imperative solution is something like fun get path: String : String =          Random  .nextInt 10 .let {             when {                 it   throw IOException "Error accessing file $path"                  else -> "content of $path"             }         }  Simulates a function that throws an  exception 80% of the time  Used as the parameter of the forEach  function; rt@ indicates where you want  to return from inside the function  var retries = 0 var result: String? = null  0 .. 3 .forEach rt@ {      try {         result = get " my path"          return@rt      } catch e: IOException  {         if  retries < 3  {             Thread.sleep 100               retries += 1         } else {             throw e          }     } } println result   This code is bad for several reasons:  As indicated by return@rt, return from  inside the function used as the  parameter of the forEach function is  triggered when the call to get succeeds.  If get throws an exception and retries is smaller than 3,  a retry is attempted after waiting for 100 ms.  If an exception is thrown and retries isn’t  smaller than 3, the exception is rethrown.  ¡  ¡  ¡  var  references.  You’re forced to use You have to use a nullable type for the result. It’s absolutely not reusable, although the concept of retrying is something that’s used often.             Retries for functions and effects     381  What you need is a retry function that takes as its parameters the following:  ¡	The function to retry ¡	A maximum number of retries ¡	A delay value between retries  This function shouldn’t rethrow any exceptions. Instead, it should return a Result.  Here’s its signature: fun   retry f:  A  -> B,                  times: Int,                  delay: Long = 10 :  A  -> Result   Using this function, you can write val functionWithRetry = retry ::get, 10, 100  functionWithRetry " my file.txt"          .forEach { println it  }, { println it.message  }   You can get this result in many different ways. One way would be to use a fold with  short circuiting, folding the range 0 to  max number of retries  but escaping as soon as  one call to the get function succeeds. You can do this easily by using a label and the  standard Kotlin fold function on a Kotlin range such as fun   retry f:  A  -> B, times: Int, delay: Long = 10  = rt@ { a: A ->      0 .. times .fold "Not executed"  { _, n ->         try {             print "Try $n: "              return@rt "Success $n: ${f a }"         } catch  e: Exception  {             Thread.sleep delay              "${e.message}"         }     } }  On the other hand, this won’t work with the range function you developed using your  List  class  in  exercise  8.19.  It  seems  to  be  due  to  a  bug  in  Kotlin  and,  in  any  case,  it  won’t  compile.1  A  way  to  solve  the  problem  is  to  use  explicit  corecursion,  as  you  learned in chapter 4. As usual, this implies defining a helper local function: fun   retry f:  A  -> B,                  times: Int,                  delay: Long = 10 :  A  -> Result  {     fun retry a: A, result: Result , e: Result , tms: Int : Result  =             result.orElse {                 when  tms  {                     0 -> e                     else -> {                         Thread.sleep delay                              log the number of retries                         println "retry ${times - tms}"    1  Read about this Kotlin bug, issue KT-24055, “Incorrect use of label with local return cause internal ex- ception in the compiler” at  https:  youtrack.jetbrains.com issue KT-24055.       382  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally                          retry a, Result.of { f a  }, result, tms - 1                      }                 }             }     return { a -> retry a, Result.of { f a  }, Result  , times - 1 } }  This  implementation  uses  a  local  function  that  calls  itself  recursively  with  a  decre- mented number of retries until either this number is 0 or the call to function f suc- ceeds. You can’t take advantage of the tailrec keyword because Kotlin doesn’t see this  function as recursive. This isn’t a problem, however, because the number of retries will  be low. The println instruction is included only to allow you to see what happens.  The local function is initially called with Result.of { f a  } as its parameter, which  is somewhat unusual. Generally, you call the local function with the same parameters as  the main function, plus additional ones. Here, the use case is a bit special because you  don’t want an initial delay.  With this function, you can transform any function into a function with automatic  retry. You can also use this function with pure effects  returning Unit  as in the follow- ing example: fun show message: String  =     Random  .nextInt 10 .let {         when {             it   throw IllegalStateException "Failure !!!"              else -> println message          }     }  fun main args: Array   {     retry ::show, 10, 20  "Hello, World!" .forEach onFailure =                                                 { println it.message  }  }  14.3  Reading properties from a file  Most software applications are configured using property files that are read at startup.  Properties are key value pairs, and both keys and values are written as strings. What- ever the chosen property format  key =value, XML, JSON, YAML, and so on , the pro- grammer always has to read strings and transform them into objects. This process is  tedious and error-prone.  You can use a specialized library for reading property files, but if something goes  wrong, you’ll find yourself throwing exceptions. To get more functional behavior, you’ll  have to write your own library. This library lets you  ¡	Read properties as strings ¡	Read properties as numerical values of various types ¡	Read properties as enums or even arbitrary types ¡	Read properties as collections of the above types   Reading properties from a file     383  ¡	Read properties while providing default values and meaningful error messages   in case something goes wrong  ¡	Read properties while never throwing exceptions  14.3.1  Loading the property file  Whichever format you use, the process is exactly the same: reading the file and han- dling any exception that could arise in that process. The first thing to do is read the  property file and return a Result , as shown in the next listing.  Listing 14.2    Reading a property file  The PropertyReader class holds a Result   from which you might read property values.  class PropertyReader configFileName: String  {  The Result.of function will return a  Success if all goes well or a Failure  if an exception occurs.  This allows to get a reference to  the generated class although the  function is placed at package level.  Loads the property  file, possibly causing  an IOException.      internal val properties: Result  =          Result.of {              MethodHandles.lookup  .lookupClass                    .getResourceAsStream configFileName                   .use { inputStream ->                      Properties  .let {                         it.load inputStream                           it                      }                 }         } }  Loads the properties  from the InputStream  The last line of the block returns the  value. You need to specify the value using  the default parameter name “it” because  the previous line returns a Boolean.  Loads the file from the  classpath  fun main args: Array   {     val propertyReader =         PropertyReader " config.properties"       propertyReader.properties.forEach onSuccess =                 { println it  }, onFailure = { println it  }  }  Here, the file is  placed at the  root of the  classpath.  If  the  file  isn’t  found,  the  use  function  doesn’t  throw  an  IOException  but  rather  returns a null inputStream, causing a NullPointerException. This function ensures  that the stream will be closed in any case.  NOTE    In this listing, if you use Intellij, you’ll need to rebuild the project before  running  the  example.  Running  it  without  rebuilding  builds  the  classes  but  doesn’t copy the resources into the output directory. This is because you load  the property file from the classpath. It could, however, be loaded from any- where on disk or read from a remote URL, or any other source.  14.3.2  Reading properties as strings  When working with property files, the simplest use case consists of reading the proper- ties as strings. This seems straightforward, but be aware that the following won’t work: properties.map { it.getProperty "name"  }   384  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally  If the property doesn’t exist, the getProperty function returns null, which results in  a Success "null" . The Properties class can be constructed with a default property  list, and the getProperty function can itself be called with a default value. But not all  properties have default values. To handle this problem, you need to use the flatMap  function together with Result.of: fun readProperty name: String  =     properties.flatMap {         Result.of {             it.getProperty name          }     }  Now  let’s  say  you  have  a  property  file  in  the  classpath  that  contains  the  following  properties: host=acme.org port=6666 name= temp=71.3 price=$45 list=34,56,67,89 person=id:3;firstName:Jeanne;lastName:Doe id=3 type=SERIAL  This file is called config.properties and is placed at the root of the classpath. You  can access its properties in a safe way with this code: fun main args: Array   {     val propertyReader = PropertyReader " config.properties"      propertyReader.readProperty "host"          .forEach onSuccess = { println it  }, onFailure = { println it  }      propertyReader.readProperty "name"          .forEach onSuccess = { println it  }, onFailure = { println it  }      propertyReader.readProperty "year"          .forEach onSuccess = { println it  }, onFailure = { println it  }  }  Given your property file, you’ll get the following result: acme.org java.lang.NullPointerException  The  first  line  corresponds  to  the  host  property,  which  is  correct.  The  second  line  corresponds to the name property. It’s an empty string, which might or might not be  correct—you don’t know. That depends on whether the name is optional from the  business point of view.  The third line corresponds to the missing year property, but the message isn’t infor- mative. It’s contained in a Result  that could be assigned to a year variable so  you’d know which property is missing. But it’d be better to have the name of the prop- erty as part of the message. Let’s make this error message more useful.   Reading properties from a file     385    14.3.3  a   good   facing  Java   you’re  on  the   problem  relies   Producing better error messages happen. is  here  The Kotlin  will  as standard  library,  expected. In particular, you expect that if a file isn’t found, or if it can’t be read, you’ll get an IOException. You might even hope to be told the full path of the file, as a miss- ing file is often a file that’s not in the right place. A good error message in such a case would be “I am looking for file 'abc' in location 'xyz' but can't find it.” Now, look at the code for the public InputStream getResourceAsStream String name  {  of  what  confident   getResourceAsStream  example  you’re   never  things   should  that   Java method:  go   so   URL url = getResource name ; try {  } catch  IOException e  {  return null;  return url != null ? url.openStream   : null;  }  }  Yes, this is how Java is written. The conclusion is that you should never call a method from the Java standard library without looking at the corresponding code!  The Javadoc says that the method returns “An input stream for reading the resource, could  or if  go null   An wrong. might occur if the file isn’t found or if there’s a problem while   reading it.

And despite the fact that an is unlikely to be thrown, you must still handle this case, as well as the general case of an unexpected exception, as shown in the following listing.  IOException  Listing 14.3       Producing specific error messages     properties can now be private private val properties: Result  =  try {  MethodHandles.lookup  .lookupClass    .getResourceAsStream configFileName  .use { inputStream ->  when  inputStream  {  null ->  else -> Properties  .let {  it.load inputStream  Result it   }  }  }  Result.failure "File $configFileName not found in classpath"   } catch  e: IOException  {  Result.failure "IOException reading classpath resource $configFileName"                                                                                                                                                        386  chapter    14  Solving common problems functionally  } catch  e: Exception  {  Result.failure "Exception: ${e.message} " +  " while reading classpath resource $configFileName"   }  If the file isn’t found, the message is File  config.properties not found in classpath  You also need to deal with property-related error messages. When using code like this val year: Result  = propertyReader.readProperty properties, "year"   it’s clear that if you get the   year property wasn’t found. But in the following example, the message gives no information about which property was missing: data class Person val id: Int, val firstName: String, val lastName: String   error message, it means the  NullPointerException  fun main args: Array   {  val propertyReader = PropertyReader " config.properties"  val person = propertyReader.readProperty "id"   .map String::toInt  .flatMap { id ->  propertyReader.readProperty "firstName"   .flatMap { firstName ->  propertyReader.readProperty "lastName"   .map { lastName -> Person id, firstName, lastName  }  }  }  }  person.forEach onSuccess = { println it  }, onFailure = { println it  }   To solve this problem, you have several options at your disposal. The simplest is to map the failure in the fun readProperty name: String  =  function of the  PropertyReader  readProperty  helper  class:    properties.flatMap {  Result.of {  it.getProperty name   }.mapFailure "Property \"$name\" no found"   }  The preceding example produces the following error message, indicating clearly that the java.lang.RuntimeException: Property "firstName" not found  property wasn’t present in the property file:    id  Another potential source of failure is a parsing error while converting the string value into an integer. For example, if the property was id=three  id  property    the error message would be java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "three"  This  error  It’s like a  doesn’t  message   you  a   give  for   Java standard  this. are  like  null, but NullPointerException.

What you need is the name of the property that caused the  exception—something like this: propertyReader.readProperty "id"      .map String::toInt      .mapFailure "Invalid format for property \"id\": ???"   But you have to write the name of the property twice, and it’d be useful to replace ???  with the value found.  This isn’t possible because the value is already lost.  Because  you’ll have to parse property values for all non-string properties, you should abstract  this inside the PropertyReader class. To do so, you’ll first rename the readProperty  function: fun readAsString name: String  =     properties.flatMap {         Result.of {             it.getProperty name          }.mapFailure "Property \"$name\" no found"      }  Then you’ll add a readAsInt function: fun readAsInt name: String : Result  =     readAsString name .flatMap {         try {             Result it.toInt            } catch  e: NumberFormatException  {             Result.failure                 "Invalid value while parsing property '$name' to Int: '$it'"          }     }  Now you don’t need to worry about errors when converting to integers: val person = propertyReader.readAsInt "id"    .flatMap { id ->     propertyReader.readAsString "firstName"        .flatMap { firstName ->         propertyReader.readAsString "lastName"            .map { lastName -> Person id, firstName, lastName  }       }   } person.forEach onSuccess = { println it  }, onFailure = { println it  }   If an exception is thrown while parsing the id property, you get java.lang.IllegalStateException:         Invalid value while parsing property 'id' to Int: 'three'"   14.3.4  Reading properties as lists  You can do the same thing you’ve done for integers for other numeric types, such as  Long or Double. You can even do much more than this. For example, you can read  properties as lists like this: list=34,56,67,89   388  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally  You only need to add a specialized function to handle this case. For that, you can use  the following function to read a property as a list of integers: fun readAsIntList name: String : Result > =   readAsString name .flatMap {     try {       Result fromSeparated it, "," .map String::toInt       } catch  e: NumberFormatException  {       Result.failure >          "Invalid value while parsing property '$name' to List : '$it'"      }   }  This code uses the fromSeparated function defined in the List class that you’ll find in  module com.fpinkotlin.common. That module is available in the code accompanying  this book  https:  github.com pysaumont fpinkotlin . You can change the code to  use the Kotlin standard List function by changing one line: fun readAsIntList name: String : Result > =   readAsString name .flatMap {     try {          Next line uses Kotlin List       Result it.split "," .map String::toInt       } catch  e: NumberFormatException  {       Result.failure >          "Invalid value while parsing property '$name' to List : $it"      }   }  But you can do much more! You can read a property as a list of any numerical values by  providing the conversion function: fun   readAsList name: String, f:  String  -> T : Result > =     readAsString name .flatMap {         try {             Result fromSeparated it, "," .map f           } catch  e: Exception  {             Result.failure >                "Invalid value while parsing property '$name' to List: $it"          }     }  And you can define functions for all sorts of number formats in terms of readAsList: fun readAsIntList name: String : Result > =                         readAsList name, String::toInt   fun readAsDoubleList name: String : Result > =                             readAsList name, String::toDouble   fun readAsBooleanList name: String : Result > =                                 readAsList name, String::toBoolean   One frequent use case consists in reading a property as an enum value, which is a partic- ular case of reading a property as any type.   Reading properties from a file     389  14.3.5  Reading enum values  You can first create a function to convert a property to any type T, taking a function  from String to Result : fun   readAsType f:  String  -> Result , name: String  =     readAsString name .flatMap  {         try {             f it          } catch  e: Exception  {             Result.failure                   "Invalid value while parsing property '$name': '$it'"          }     }  You can now create a readAsEnum function in terms of readAsType: inline fun  > readAsEnum name: String,                                     enumClass: Class  : Result  {     val f:  String  -> Result  = {         try {             val value = enumValueOf  it              Result value          } catch  e: Exception  {             Result.failure "Error parsing property '$name': " +                     "value '$it' can't be parsed to ${enumClass.name}."          }     }     return readAsType f, name  }  Note that reified means that type T is to be accessible at runtime. Unlike Java, Kotlin  allows accessing type parameters at runtime by using the keyword reified, so that it’s  not erased. This possibility is only accessible in functions declared with inline, mean- ing that the compiler is allowed to copy the code of the function at the call site, instead  of referencing the original code. This increases the size of the compiled code.  Given the following property  type=SERIAL  and the following enum enum class Type {SERIAL, PARALLEL}  you can now read the property using the following code: val type = propertyReader.readAsEnum "type", Type::class.java   So far you’ve been reading properties as String, Int, Double, Boolean, lists, or enums.  It can also be interesting to read properties as arbitrary objects. For this, you’ll have  to write the object properties in a kind of serialized form in the property file and then  load these properties and deserialize them.   390    14.3.6  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally  can use the  Reading properties of arbitrary types You could read the following property to get a person=id:3,firstName:Jane,lastName:Doe  getAsType  Person:  function to read a property as any type.

Creates a  PropertyReader from  a property string  14.4  Converting an imperative program: The XML reader  Writing new functional programs for any task you have to accomplish is exciting, but  most developers generally don’t have time for this. Often you’ll want to use existing  imperative programs in your own code. This is the case each time you want to use an  existing library.  You might find it more interesting to start from scratch and build a completely new,  100% functional solution. But you have to be realistic. You generally don’t have the  time or budget to do this, and you’ll have to use existing nonfunctional libraries full  of null, exceptions throwing and impure functions mutating their parameters on the  outside world.  As you’ll soon discover, once you’re comfortable with functional techniques, it’s a  pain to go back to the old imperative coding style. The solution is generally to build a  thin functional wrapper around these imperative libraries. As an example, let’s exam- ine a common library for reading XML files, JDOM 2.0.6. This is the most commonly  used Java library for this task, and it’s perfectly usable with Kotlin.  14.4.1  Step 1: The imperative solution  Let’s start with the example program in listing 14.6. This program comes from one of the  numerous sites proposing tutorials about how to use JDOM  http:  www.mkyong.com  java how-to-read-xml-file-in-java-jdom-example  . I’ve chosen this example because it’s  minimal and fits easily in the book. This is a Java program using a Java library.   Converting an imperative program: The XML reader     393  Listing 14.6    Reading XML data with JDOM: Java version  import org.jdom2.Document; import org.jdom2.Element; import org.jdom2.JDOMException; import org.jdom2.input.SAXBuilder; import java.io.File; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.List;  public class ReadXmlFile {    public static void main String[] args  {     SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder  ;     File xmlFile = new File "path_to_file" ;     try {       Document document =  Document  builder.build xmlFile ;       Element rootNode = document.getRootElement  ;       List list = rootNode.getChildren "staff" ;       for  int i = 0; i < list.size  ; i++  {         Element node =  Element  list.get i ;         System.out.println "First Name : " +                                     node.getChildText "firstname"  ;         System.out.println "\tLast Name : " +                                     node.getChildText "lastname"  ;         System.out.println "\tNick Name : " +                                     node.getChildText "email"  ;         System.out.println "\tSalary : " + node.getChildText "salary"  ;       }     } catch  IOException io  {       System.out.println io.getMessage   ;     } catch  JDOMException jdomex  {       System.out.println jdomex.getMessage   ;     }   } }  This Java program can easily be rewritten in imperative Kotlin, as you can see in the  next listing.  Listing 14.7    Reading XML data with JDOM: Imperative Kotlin version  import org.jdom2.JDOMException import org.jdom2.input.SAXBuilder import java.io.File import java.io.IOException   **  * Not testable, throws exceptions.  *  fun main args: Array   {      val builder = SAXBuilder     394  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally      val xmlFile = File " path to file.xml"     Fix the path      try {         val document = builder.build xmlFile          val rootNode = document.rootElement         val list = rootNode.getChildren "staff"           list.forEach {             println "First Name: ${it.getChildText "firstName" }"              println "\tLast Name: ${it.getChildText "lastName" }"              println "\tEmail: ${it.getChildText "email" }"              println "\tSalary: ${it.getChildText "salary" }"          }     } catch  io: IOException  {         println io.message      } catch  e: JDOMException  {         println e.message      } }  The data file used with this example is shown in the following listing.

The  first problem you might encounter is that no part of the program can be reused. It’s  only an example, but even as an example, it should be written in a reusable way so that  it’s at least testable. Here, the only way to test the program is to look at the console,  which will display either the expected result or an error message. As you’ll see, it might  even display an erroneous result.  14.4.2  Step 2: Making an imperative program more functional  To determine the necessary functions and to make this program more functional, you  start by  ¡	Listing the fundamental functions you need   Converting an imperative program: The XML reader     395  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  Writing those functions as autonomous, reusable, and testable units Coding the example by composing these functions  The main functions you’ll need will do the following:  Read a file and return the content as an XML string Convert the XML string into a list of elements Convert a list of elements into a list of string representations of these elements  You’ll also need an effect for displaying the list of strings to the computer screen.       This   NOTE entirely in memory.  description   is   only   suitable   for   a   small   file   that   can   be   loaded  The first function you’ll need, which reads a file and returns the contents as an XML string, can be implemented as the following: fun readFile2String path: String : Result   This function doesn’t throw any exceptions; it returns a  Result .  The second function converts an XML string into a list of elements, so it needs to  know the name of the root XML element. It has the following signature: fun readDocument rootElementName: String,  stringDoc: String : Result >  The third function receives a list of elements as its argument and returns a list of string representations of those elements. This is implemented by a function with the follow- ing signature: fun toStringList list: List , format: String : List   Eventually you’ll need to apply an effect to the data, so you’ll have to define it with the following signature: fun   processList list: List    in   look   much   doesn’t   different   functions   decomposition   This  could do in imperative programming.

In contrast, your functions com- pose perfectly. composing the functions and appLying an effect Although the argument and return types don’t match, you can compose these func- tions easily using a comprehension pattern like this: const val format = "First Name : %s\n" +         "\tLast Name : %s\n" +         "\tEmail : %s\n" +         "\tSalary : %s"  fun main args: Array   {     val path = getXmlFilePath       val rDoc = path.flatMap ::readFile2String      val rRoot = getRootElementName       val result = rDoc.flatMap { doc ->         rRoot.flatMap { rootElementName ->             readDocument rootElementName, doc          }.map { list ->             toStringList list, format          }     }     ... }  To display the result, apply the corresponding effect: result.forEach onSuccess =     { processList it  }, onFailure = { it.printStackTrace   }   This functional version of the program is much cleaner, and it’s fully testable. Or, at  least, it will be when you’ve implemented all the necessary functions. impLementing the functions Your program is relatively elegant, but you still have to implement the functions and  effects you’re using in order to make it work. The good news is that each function is  simple and can be easily tested.  First, you’ll implement the getXmlFilePath and getRootElementName functions. In  our example, these are constants that would be replaced with a specific implementa- tion in a real application: fun getRootElementName  : Result  =     Result.of { "staff" }    Simulating a computation that may fail.  fun getXmlFilePath  : Result  =     Result.of { "file.xml" }    <- adjust path  Then you need to implement the readFile2String function. Here’s one of the many  possible implementations: fun readFile2String path: String : Result  =                                       Result.of { File path .readText   }   Converting an imperative program: The XML reader     397  Can throw a NullPointerException  Next, you need to implement the readDocument function. This function takes as its  parameters an XML string containing the XML data and the name of the root element: fun readDocument rootElementName: String,                  stringDoc: String : Result > =   SAXBuilder  .let { builder ->     try {       val document =         builder.build StringReader stringDoc          val rootElement = document.rootElement        Result List *rootElement.getChildren rootElementName                                .toTypedArray          } catch  io: IOException  {       Result.failure "Invalid root element name '$rootElementName' "                             + "or XML data $stringDoc: ${io.message}"      } catch  jde: JDOMException  {       Result.failure "Invalid root element name '$rootElementName' "                             + "or XML data $stringDoc: ${jde.message}"      } catch  e: Exception  {       Result.failure "Unexpected error while reading XML data "                             + "$stringDoc: ${e.message}"      }   }  The * at the start of the expression indicates that the resulting  array should be used as a vararg and not as a single object.

But you can still do better. You’re still using four nonfunctional elements:  ¡  ¡  The file path The name of the root element                                                                           398  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally  ¡	The format used to convert the elements to string ¡	The effect that’s applied to the result  By nonfunctional, I mean that these elements are accessed directly from the imple- mentation  of  your  functions,  making  them  nonreferentially  transparent.  To  make  your program fully functional, you should make these elements parameters of your  program.  The processElement function also used specific data in the form of the element  names, which correspond to the parameters of the format string used to display them.  You can replace the format parameter with a Pair  the format string and a list of param- eters . This way, the processElement function becomes the following: fun toStringList list: List ,                  format: Pair > : List  =         list.map { e -> processElement e, format  }  fun processElement element: Element,                    format: Pair > : String {     val formatString = format.first     val parameters = format.second.map { element.getChildText it  }     return String.format formatString, *parameters.toArrayList  .toArray    }  Now your program can be a pure function, taking four arguments and returning a new   nonfunctional  executable program as its result. This version of the program is repre- sented in the following listing.

This function throws exceptions.  There’s nothing better to do, because it’s an effect and  can’t return a value.  fun readFile2String path: String : Result  =                                      Result.of { File path .readText   }  fun readDocument rootElementName: String,                  stringDoc: String : Result > =     SAXBuilder  .let { builder ->         try {             val document = builder.build StringReader stringDoc               val rootElement = document.rootElement             Result List *rootElement.getChildren rootElementName                                                      .toTypedArray             } catch  io: IOException  {             Result.failure "Invalid root element name '$rootElementName' "                     + "or XML data $stringDoc: ${io.message}"          } catch  jde: JDOMException  {             Result.failure "Invalid root element name '$rootElementName' "                     + "or XML data $stringDoc: ${jde.message}"          } catch  e: Exception  {             Result.failure "Unexpected error while reading XML data "                     + "$stringDoc: ${e.message}"          }     }  fun toStringList list: List ,                  format: Pair > : List  =         list.map { e -> processElement e, format  }  fun processElement element: Element,                    format: Pair > :                                             String {      val formatString = format.first  The processElement function  is no longer specific.  val parameters = format.second.map { element.getChildText it  } return String.format formatString, *parameters.toArrayList  .toArray     }  At this point, you can test this program with the client code shown in the following listing.  Listing 14.10       The client program to test the XML reader  import com.fpinkotlin.common.List import com.fpinkotlin.common.Result  fun   processList list: List   = list.forEach ::println   fun getRootElementName  : Result  =       400  chapter    14  Solving common problems functionally  Result.of { "staff" }    Simulating a computation that may fail.  fun getXmlFilePath  : Result  =  Result.of { " path to file.xml" }    <- adjust path  private val format = Pair "First Name : %s\n" +  "\tLast Name : %s\n" + "\tEmail : %s\n" + "\tSalary : %s", List "firstName", "lastName", "email", "salary"    fun main args: Array   {  val program = readXmlFile  { getXmlFilePath   },  { getRootElementName   }, format, { processList it  }   program    }  This program isn’t ideal because you haven’t handled the potential error that could arise from invalid element names. For example, if you use a wrong element name as in        Smith   paul.smith@acme.com   100000            Mary   Colson   mary.colson@acme.com   200000         you’ll get the following result: First Name : null  Last Name : Smith email : paul.smith@acme.com Salary : 100000 First Name : null  Last Name : Colson email : mary.colson@acme.com Salary : 200000  null  You can guess what the error is by seeing that all the first names are null. It’d be better to replace the word with an explicit message containing the erroneous element name. A more important problem is that if you forget one of the element names in the list, you’ll get an exception from the function because of the following code: val parameters = format.second.map { element.getChildText it  } return String.format formatString, *parameters.toArrayList  .toArray     String.format  this   code,   the In  expected four.

In fact, the real cause of the problem is that you’ve taken all the specific data out function, such as the root element name, the file path, and the of the effect to apply, but the function is still specific to the client business function only allows you to read all elements that are direct use case.

This is a source of error if arguments are swapped, which won’t be detected by the compiler. You can easily fix this problem, so let’s tackle that next. After that, you’ll fix the first two  readXmlFile  problems.       14.4.4  third problem is easy to fix by using the value types technique described in chap- and are value classes for string values as  Step 4: Fixing the argument type problem The ter 3.

The simplest way is to check the value against a regular expression.  as follows: fun readXmlFile sPath:    -> FilePath,  readXmlFile  modified   function   types,   these   new   can   use   the  To   be      sRootName:    -> ElementName, format: Pair >, effect:  List   -> Unit :    -> Unit {  val path = sPath  .value val rDoc = path.flatMap ::readFile2String  val rRoot = sRootName  .value  As you see, the changes are minimal. The client class must also be modified: fun getRootElementName  : ElementName =  ElementName "staff"     Simulating a computation that may fail.  fun getXmlFilePath  : FilePath =  FilePath " path to file.xml"     <- adjust path  With these changes, it’s now impossible to switch the order of the arguments without being warned by the compiler.                                                                                                                       The effect to be  applied is now  parameterized by  List .  402  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally  14.4.5  Step 5: Making the element-processing function a parameter  The two remaining problems can be solved with a single change: passing the element-  processing function as a parameter to the readXmlFile method. This way, this function  has a single task: it reads the list of first-level elements in the file, applies a configurable  function to this list, and returns the result. The main difference is that the function will  no longer produce a list of strings and apply a string effect. You’ll need to make the  function generic. This means only the following changes: fun   readXmlFile          sPath:    -> FilePath,          sRootName:    -> ElementName,         function:  Element  -> T,          effect:  List   -> Unit :    -> Unit {      val path = sPath  .value     val rDoc = path.flatMap ::readFile2String      val rRoot = sRootName  .value     val result = rDoc.flatMap { doc ->         rRoot.flatMap { rootElementName ->             readDocument rootElementName, doc  }                 .map { list -> list.map function  }      }     return {         result.forEach onSuccess = { effect it  },                 onFailure = { throw it }      } }  The function is made generic.  The Pair >  format argument has disappeared, and a  new function argument replaces it. This  is the function that will be applied to  convert the list of elements to a list of T.  The toStringList and  processElement functions have been  removed. They’re replaced with an  application of the received function.  The client program can now be modified accordingly. This relieves you from using the  Pair trick to pass both the format string and the list of parameter names: const val format = "First Name : %s\n" +      "\tLast Name : %s\n" +     "\tEmail : %s\n" +     "\tSalary : %s"  The format is now again set as a simple string.  private val elementNames =      List "firstName", "lastName", "email", "salary"   The list of element names is also set separately.  The processElement function is  now implemented by the client.  private fun processElement element: Element : String =      String.format format, *elementNames.map { element.getChildText it  }         .toArrayList           .toArray     fun main args: Array   {     val program = readXmlFile ::getXmlFilePath,                               ::getRootElementName,                               ::processElement,                                ::processList    ...  The processElement function is  passed as an argument.  The processList effect hasn’t changed. Now it’s up to the client to provide a function  to convert one element and an effect to apply to this element.   Converting an imperative program: The XML reader     403  14.4.6  Step 6: Handling errors on element names  Now you’re left with the problem of errors happening when reading the elements. The  function that’s passed to the readXmlFile function returns a raw type, meaning that  it should be a total function but it’s not. It was a total function in the initial example  because an error produced the null string. Now that you’re using a function from Ele- ment to T, you could use Result  as the realization of T, but this wouldn’t be  practical because you’d end up with a List > and you’d have to transform it  into a Result >. Not a big deal, but this should definitely be abstracted.  The solution is to use a function from Element to Result  and to use the sequence   function to transform the result into a Result >. Here’s the new function: fun   readXmlFile sPath:    -> FilePath,                 sRootName:    -> ElementName,                 function:  Element  -> Result ,                  effect:  List   -> Unit :    -> Unit {     val path = sPath  .value     val rDoc = path.flatMap ::readFile2String      val rRoot = sRootName  .value     val result = rDoc.flatMap { doc ->         rRoot.flatMap { rootElementName ->             readDocument rootElementName, doc  }                 .flatMap { list ->                     sequence list.map function   }      }     return {         result.forEach onSuccess = { effect it  },                 onFailure = { throw it }      } }   ...  The only additional change to be made is to handle the error that might occur in the  processElement function. The best approach is once again to examine the code of the  getChildText method from JDOM. This method is implemented as follows:  **  * Returns the textual content of the named child element, or null if  * there's no such child. This method is a convenience because calling  *  getChild  .getText    can throw a NullPointerException.  *  * @param cname the name of the child  * @return text   content for the named child, or null if no such child  *  public String getChildText final String cname  {   final Element child = getChild cname ;   if  child == null  {     return null;   }   return child.getText  ; }  The function received as an  argument is now a function from  Element to Result .  The result is sequenced,  producing a Result >.  The map function has to be  replaced with flatMap.   404  chapter 14  Solving common problems functionally  As  you  continue  examining  the  code  for  the  getChild  method,  you  can  see  this  method won’t throw any exceptions, but it will return null if the element doesn’t exist.  You can modify your processElement function like this: fun processElement element: Element : Result  =      try {         Result String.format format, *elementNames.map {                                     getChildText element, it  }             .toArrayList               .toArray         } catch  e: Exception  {         Result.failure                "Exception while formatting element. " +                "Probable cause is a missing element name in element " +               "list $elementNames"      }  In case of an exception formatting the  result, an explicit error message is built.  The function now returns  a Result .  fun getChildText element: Element,                  name: String : String =      element.getChildText name  ?:         "Element $name is not a child of ${element.name}"  If the returned value is null, it’s replaced  with an explicit error message.  Now most potential errors are handled in a functional way, but not all errors can be  handled functionally. As I said earlier, exceptions that are thrown by the effect passed  to the readXmlFile method can’t be handled this way. These are exceptions thrown  by the program that’s returned by the function. When the function returns the pro- gram, it hasn’t yet been executed. These exceptions must be caught while executing  the resulting program, for example: fun main args: Array   {     val program = readXmlFile ::getXmlFilePath,                               ::getRootElementName,                               ::processElement,                               ::processList      try {         program       } catch  e: Exception  {         println "An exception occurred: ${e.message}"      } }  You’ll  find  the  complete  example  in  the  code  accompanying  this  book  at  http:   github.com pysaumont fpinkotlin.  14.4.7  Step 7: Additional improvements to the formerly imperative code  One  might  object  that  the  processElement  function  closes  over  the  format  and  element Names references, which might not seem functional.  If you don’t remember  what closure means, see chapter 3.  In fact, this isn’t a real problem in the example  because those are constants. But in real life, they probably wouldn’t be constants.  The solution to this problem is easy. These closures are additional implicit argu- ments of the processElement function. The indication of the problem is that unlike    Converting an imperative program: The XML reader     405  the definition of the function, these two values should be part of the client program, meaning the    function.  main  processElement  You could put the    function too  as a local func- main tion , but this would make it nonreusable. The solution is to use explicit argument with a curried val processElement:  List   ->  String  ->  Element  ->    function as explained in chapter 3:  function in the  val  Result  = { elementNames ->  { format ->  { element ->  try {  Result String.format format,  *elementNames.map { getChildText element, it  }  .toArrayList   .toArray     } catch  e: Exception  {  Result.failure "Exception while formatting element.

By abstracting every  possible subtask into a function, you’ll make your programs more testable and, as a  consequence, more reliable. You’ll also be able to reuse these functions in other pro- grams without having to test them again. Appendix B shows you how to apply abstrac- tion to testing.  Summary  ¡	Putting values in the Result context is the functional equivalent of assertions. ¡	Property files can be read in a safe manner using the Result context. ¡	Functional property reading relieves you of handling conversion errors. ¡	Properties can be read as any type, enum, or collection in an abstracted way. ¡	Automatic retries can be abstracted into functions. ¡	Functional wrappers can be built around legacy imperative libraries.   appendix A  Mixing Kotlin with Java  Such   programs   first created as a language running on the  Kotlin was Java Virtual Machine  JVM .

There’s no limit to this, although you should probably not call any of these methods without first verifying whether Kotlin offers a better solution. On the other hand, Java programs can use libraries developed in Kotlin, although not as easily. Kotlin offers much more than Java, and those features unavailable in Java must be handled with extra care.

Gradle is also one of the best tools  for managing Java projects, so you won’t be surprised to learn that Gradle is the way to  go for mixed Java Kotlin projects. With mixed projects, you can use the best of both  worlds, including the huge mass of Java code that’s available in open source and usable  in your Kotlin programs.  If you’re already using Gradle to build Java programs, you can build and manage  Kotlin or mixed Kotlin Java projects as you already do for pure Java projects. Other- wise, now might be the right time to switch to a modern build tool. But even if you  already are a Gradle user, you might benefit in learning how to write Gradle scripts  using Kotlin.  In May 2016, the Gradle team announced that Kotlin would become the language  of choice for writing Gradle scripts. Prior to that, the Groovy language was used for this  purpose. This announcement didn’t imply that support for Groovy was deprecated in  Gradle. You can still write Gradle scripts using Groovy, but Kotlin is so much more prac- tical that I recommend you give it a try. And if you’re new to Gradle, I recommend you  go directly for Kotlin.  Kotlin offers many benefits when writing Gradle scripts for Kotlin or mixed Java  Kotlin projects. The most evident is that you don’t have to learn yet another language.  But a more important benefit is that you’ll get much better support for Kotlin Gradle  scripts in your IDE  at least when using IntelliJ . IntelliJ offers the same level of support  for Kotlin Gradle scripts as for Kotlin programs, including syntax checking, auto com- pletion, and refactoring.  A.1.1  Creating a simple project with Gradle  Creating a simple Gradle Kotlin Java project couldn’t be easier. Here’s an example: plugins {     application     kotlin "jvm"  version "1.3.21"        Change version according to your needs }  application {     mainClassName = "com.mydomain.mysimpleproject.MainKt" }  repositories {     jcenter   }  dependencies {     compile kotlin "stdlib"   }   Creating and managing mixed projects     409  the   this   script   name   under   Save  your project; for example, MySimpleProject. In this directory, add a subdirectory structure such as the following: MySimpleProject  build.gradle.kts   directory   name   the   by   in   of   a   src  main  test  java kotlin  java kotlin  You’re done! You can now add Kotlin and Java files to your project and manage your project using the various Gradle commands. To create a Kotlin program with a Java dependency, add the following files to your project:  ¡  ¡  MySimpleProject src main java com mydomain mysimpleproject MyClass .java MySimpleProject src main kotlin com mydomain mysimpleproject Main.kt     Here’s the content of MyClass.java: package com.mydomain.mysimpleproject;  public class MyClass {  public static String getMessage Lang language  {  switch  language  {  case ENGLISH:  return "Hello";  case FRENCH:  return "Bonjour";  case GERMAN:  return "Hallo";  case SPANISH:  return "Hola";  default:  return "Saluton";  }  }  }  }  And here’s the content of Main.kt: package com.mydomain.mysimpleproject  fun main args: Array   {  println MyClass.getMessage Lang.GERMAN    enum class Lang { GERMAN, FRENCH, ENGLISH, SPANISH }  using   the   following   Gradle   command   in   the   project  can   run   now   your   You  directory  MySimpleProject :   bin gradle run  project                                                                        410  appendix a  Mixing Kotlin with Java  If you want to build and assemble your project into a ZIP or TAR file, use the following  Gradle command in the project directory  MySimpleProject :   bin gradle assembleDist  This should create the two following files:  ¡	MySimpleProject build distributions MySimpleProject.tar ¡	MySimpleProject build distributions MySimpleProject.zip  You can then extract one of these archives somewhere and use the included shell script  to launch it.  A.1.2   Importing your Gradle project into IntelliJ Importing your Gradle project into IntelliJ is straightforward:  ¡	Select File > New > Project from Existing Sources, select your project directory, and   click OK.  ¡	Select Import Project from External Model, then Gradle, and click Next. ¡	Select Use Default Gradle Wrapper, and then click Finish.  Alternatively, you can select a local distribution of Gradle. You can also select a min- imum JDK version, such as JDK 6  the version used by Android . And for creating a  empty project for which you have created the build script only, you can select the Create  Directories  for  Empty  Content  Roots  Automatically  option.  This  automatically  creates  the  necessary directory structure, including Java and Kotlin main and test directories, as  well as a resource directory. If some of these already exist, they’ll be preserved. Now  you can continue developing your project, adding Kotlin and Java files at will.  A.1.3  Adding dependencies to your project  To add dependencies to your project, you need to use the standard Gradle syntax: val kotlintestVersion = "3.1.10" val logbackVersion = "1.2.3" val slf4jVersion = "1.7.25"  plugins {     application     kotlin "jvm"  version "1.3.21"    Change version according to your needs }  application {     mainClassName = "com.mydomain.mysimpleproject.MainKt" }  repositories {     jcenter   }   Creating and managing mixed projects     411  dependencies {  compile kotlin "stdlib"   testCompile "io.kotlintest:kotlintest-runner-junit5:$kotlintestVersion"  testRuntime "org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:$slf4jVersion"   In the block, you can’t use a variable for the version.

Additionally, you might want to declare the version number in a single place to make maintenance easier.

In fact, no Kotlin program running on a JVM can avoid calling Java methods, whether explicitly or implicitly. This is because most Kotlin standard library functions call Java standard library methods.  Calling Java methods from Kotlin code would be simple if Kotlin and Java types were the same, but they aren’t. This is fortunate because Kotlin types are much more power- ful than Java types, but it means you have to be careful how you handle the differences and the conversions.                                                                                           Java library methods and Kotlin code     413  A.2.1  Using Java primitives  The most visible difference is probably the absence of primitives in Kotlin. In Java, int  and Integer are the primitive and object representations of an integer value, respec- tively. Kotlin only uses Int, which is sometimes called a value type, meaning that it can  be handled like an object but performs like a primitive. But Java may well have value  types in the near future.1  Although an Int is an object in Kotlin, computation is done under the hood as if it  were a primitive. The same is true for other Java primitives that have value type equiva- lents in Kotlin  such as byte, short, long, float, double, and boolean; all have a corre- sponding value type in Kotlin . The only difference, besides that they must be handled  as objects, is that in Kotlin, the first letter is a capital letter.  Kotlin automatically does the conversion between Java primitives and Kotlin value  types. You can still use the Integer Java type in Kotlin, but you won’t gain any of the ben- efits of using value types. In Kotlin, you can also use the other numeric Java object types,  but as the names are the same, you’ll have to use the fully qualified name, such as java. lang.Long. You’ll then get the following compile warning: Warning: ...  Kotlin: This class shouldn't be used in Kotlin. Use kotlin.Long   instead.  You should almost always avoid using Java numerical object types because Kotlin does a  serious job of handling the conversion. Consider the following: val a: java.lang.Long = java.lang.Long.valueOf 3L   This won’t compile and you’ll get the following error message: Error: ...  Kotlin: Type mismatch: inferred type is kotlin.Long! but java.  lang.Long was expected  Kotlin automatically converts the result of the call to the java.lang.Long.valueOf    method to kotlin.Long, so this code doesn’t compile. You can, however, write val a: java.lang.Long = java.lang.Long 3   But why would you want to do so? Java primitives are converted to non-nullable types   for example, Java int is converted to Int , but the object numerical types are con- verted to nullable types  for example, Java Integer is converted to Int? .  A.2.2  Using Java numerical object types  Java also provides numerical types with no primitive equivalent, such as BigInteger  and BigDecimal. These types can be used in Kotlin with the additional benefit that  Kotlin simplifies their handling. For example, you can write val a = BigInteger.valueOf 3   val b = BigInteger.valueOf 5   println a + b == BigInteger.valueOf 8    http:  cr.openjdk.java.net ~jrose values values-0.html  for a description of value types in the   1  See Project Valhalla.         414    appendix a  Mixing Kotlin with Java  This prints true    +  Not only can you use the for equality.

If you let Kotlin infer the type, Kotlin does something like this:  is what is called a This code won’t compile, but it shows what Kotlin does. non denotable type, meaning a type that you can’t write in your program but one that the Kotlin compiler uses internally.  IntelliJ will show these types where they are inferred.  What you write is this: val a: BigInteger = BigInteger.valueOf 3   BigInteger!  NullPointerException  Kotlin will throw a null. This of course will never occur with that could return your program will fail as fast as possible, preventing the  if the value returned by the Java method is BigInteger.valueOf, but with Java methods  there are many of them in the Java standard library , it insures to leak inside your code.

A.2.4   Using Kotlin and Java string types Kotlin a  special  java     type. Once again, the Kotlin type is much more powerful.

Besides this, is fully automated and transparent to the  java.lang.String  Implementing other type conversions Collections and arrays provide the main other type conversions that occur when calling Java methods.

This could be a huge problem because you might assume it would do this check at runtime. Let’s say you have the following Java code: package test;  null  import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.List;  public class Test {  public static List  getIntegerList   {  return Arrays.asList 1, 2, 3, null ;  }  }  You might want to call the val list: MutableList  = test.Test.getIntegerList    getIntegerList  method from Kotlin as  println list   This causes no error and prints [1, 2, 3, null]  But if you do the following in Kotlin val list: MutableList  = test.Test.getIntegerList    list.forEach { println it + 1  }  you’ll get a  NullPointerException  when Kotlin tries to call the  add  function on  null.                                                                                         416  A.2.6     appendix a  Mixing Kotlin with Java  calling a Java method taking a  Using Java varargs When you use an array prefixed with the spread of a Java method: public static void show String... strings  {  vararg  for  String string : strings  { System.out.println string ;  }  }  This method can be called from Kotlin using an array: val stringArray = arrayOf "Mickey", "Donald", "Pluto"  MyClass.show *stringArray   as its argument from Kotlin, Kotlin lets *. Consider the following example  operator,  A.2.7   Specifying nullability in Java As I said earlier, all non primitive Java types are always nullable. On the other hand, they can be annotated, and many tools use such annotations to indicate that references of certain types should never be null. Although there’s a standard specification for this  JSR-305  javax.annotation , many tools prefer their own set of annotations:  @NotNull  from the    org.jetbrains.annotations  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡    and @Nullable  IntelliJ uses the package to specify nullability in Java. Eclipse uses the Android  tions FindBugs uses the  packages.  has   the  edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.  org.eclipse.jdt.annotation com.android.annotations  package. and  android.support.annota-  When used to specify nullability, Kotlin understands all these annotations  and more . For example, a Java property can be annotated with @NotNull public static List  getIntegerList   {  return null;  null  IntelliJ flags the element with a message saying “Passing 'null' argument to param- eter annotated with @NotNull,” but this doesn’t prevent the Java code from compil-   ing. When calling this method from Kotlin, the inferred type is  Mutable List  instead of java.lang.IllegalStateException: @NotNull method test MyClass.getIntegerList  and the compiler will issue an exception:   Mutable List !  must not return null  this   won’t   Unfortunately,  method: @NotNull public static List  getIntegerList   {  parameter.   work   type   the   for   return Arrays.asList 1, 2, 3, null ;  Consider   the   following   Java  }  }                                                                                                         Java library methods and Kotlin code     417  You’ll get a warning about the null value in Java, but nothing in Kotlin until you try  using the null value, which causes a NullPointerException. Using @NotNull on a type  parameter isn’t different than specifying a non-null parameter type on the Kotlin side  or even not specifying any type. That’s because Kotlin infers List   non denotable  type , giving the exact same result. If, however, you want to use parameter type annota- tions, you’ll have to use at least version 1.5.0 of the org.jetbrains.annotation library  and have your compilation target level set to at least Java 8.  NOTE    Kotlin supports the JSR-305 specification, so if you need more Java annota- tion support, refer to https:  kotlinlang.org docs reference java-interop.html.  A.2.8  Calling getters and setters  Java getters and setters can be called as standard methods from Kotlin code. Kotlin also  allows  and recommends  calling them with the Kotlin property syntax. Let’s say you  have the following Java class: public class MyClass {      private int value;      public int getValue   {         return value;     }      public void setValue int value  {         this.value = value;     } }  You  can  access  the  value  property  using  either  the  method  syntax  or  the  property  syntax: val myClass = MyClass   myClass.value = 1 println myClass.value   myClass.setValue 2  println myClass.getValue     The former is highly recommended. The property syntax can be used to read the Java  field when there’s no setter, which is the case if the field is initialized in the constructor.  It’ll work even if there’s no field at all, such as public class MyClass {      public int getValue   {         return 0;     } }   418    appendix a  Mixing Kotlin with Java  But it won’t work for setting a property with no getter. For Boolean properties with a Java getter starting with is. Consider the following Java class: public class MyClass {  is, the Kotlin property name is prefixed with  boolean started = true; boolean working = false;  public boolean isStarted   {  return started;  public boolean getWorking   {  return working;  }  }  }  myClass.started = true myClass.working = false println myClass.started  println myClass.isStarted  println myClass.working   These properties can be read in Kotlin using the following syntax: val myClass = MyClass    methods. Setters in Java are actually methods returning  This avoids the clash that would occur if a Java class has both Something ods are called from Kotlin with the method function syntax, they return is a singleton object: val result: Unit = myClass.setWorking false     isSomething  and  get- void. If such meth- Unit, which  A.2.9   Accessing Java properties with reserved names you might need to access from Kotlin a Java property that has a name that Sometimes, that are used as short names clashes with a reserved word in Kotlin, such as inputStream. If you’re writing both the Java or the Kotlin code, the best for thing to do is to avoid such names. But if you’re using a library you don’t control, you can use  backticks to escape the property name. Here’s an example.  input  and  or  in  is  Java class:  public class MyClass {  private InputStream in;  public void setIn InputStream in  {  this.in = in;  public InputStream getIn   {  return in;  }  }  }                                                         SAM interfaces     419  In Kotlin, all exceptions are unchecked. As a consequence, Kotlin lets you call a Java  method throwing a checked exception without using a try...catch block.  Kotlin code: val input = myClass.`in`  A.2.10  Calling checked exceptions  Java:  try {     Thread.sleep 10 ; } catch  InterruptedException e  {        handle exception }  Kotlin: Thread.sleep 10   A.3   Unlike what’s often done in Java, this doesn’t work as a wrapper. If you use a try... catch block and an exception is thrown, it’ll still be the original exception and not an  unchecked wrapper exception.  SAM interfaces Unlike Kotlin, Java doesn’t have function types; functions are handled by convert- ing lambdas into something that’s equivalent to a Single Abstract Method  or SAM   interface implementation.  It isn’t an implementation of the interface, but it acts as  if it’s one.   Kotlin, on the other hand, has true function types, so no such conversion is needed.  But when calling Java methods taking SAM interfaces as their parameters, Kotlin func- tions are automatically converted. For example, you can write the following Kotlin code: val executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor   executor.submit { println "Hello, World!"  }  The submit Java method takes a Runnable as its parameter. In Java, the same program  would be written as follows: ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor  ; executor.submit    -> System.out.println "Hello, World!"  ;  Note that you can explicitly create a java.lang.Runnable in Kotlin using the following  syntax: val runnable = Runnable { println "Hello, World!"  }  But this isn’t the way to go. One should rather create a Kotlin function and have it con- verted automatically into a Runnable when calling a Java method: val executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor   val runnable:    -> Unit = { println "Hello, World!"  } executor.submit runnable    420  appendix a  Mixing Kotlin with Java  A.4  Kotlin functions and Java code  Calling a Kotlin function from Java code isn’t more difficult than the other way round.  But because Kotlin is more feature-rich than Java, you’ll often lose some functionality.  A.4.1  Converting Kotlin properties  Properties in Java consist in coding conventions. In Kotlin, properties are a language  feature.  Although  Kotlin  programs  are  compiled  into  Java  bytecode,  the  compiler  takes care of the conversion. Kotlin properties are converted into the standard set of  Java field and accessors:  ¡	A private field with the same name as the property ¡	A getter with the name of the property with a capital initial and prefixed with get ¡	A setter with the name of the property with a capital initial and prefixed with set  The only exception is that if the Kotlin property name starts with is. This name is used  for the getter, and the setter name is obtained by replacing is with set.  A.4.2  Using Kotlin public fields  Kotlin public fields are exposed as Java properties  meaning with getters and setters . If  you want to use them as Java fields, you have to annotate them in the Kotlin code like this: @JvmField val age = 25  In this case, you can no longer access the Kotlin property from Java using accessors. Also note that Kotlin properties declared with can be accessed both as fields or with getters. They can’t be annotated with  lateinit @JvmField.  A.4.3   Static fields Kotlin has no explicitly static fields, but some Kotlin fields can be seen as static. This is the case of fields declared in objects, including companion objects, as well as fields declared at package level. All these fields can be accessed from Java code in the same way  in  companion objects can be accessed with getters and setters using the following syntax: int weight = MyClass.Companion.getWeight  ;  differences.   properties,   although   declared   Fields   some   with   as   const, you have to access it as a static field of the enclos-  But if the field is declared with ing class: int weight = MyClass.weight;  The same result can be obtained if the field is annotated declared in standalone objects, use the following syntax: String firstName = MyObject.INSTANCE.getFirstName  ;  with  @JvmField. For fields  const  or annotated with  @JvmField, it must be  Once again, if the field is declared with accessed like a static field: String firstName = MyObject.firstName;                                                       Kotlin functions and Java code     421  Fields declared at package level can be accessed as if they were static fields of a class  with the name of the enclosing file without the .kt extension, but postfixed with Kt.  Imagine the following code in MyFile.kt: const val length = 12  val width = 3  These fields can be accessed from Java as: int length = MyFileKt.length; int width = MyFileKt.getWidth  ;  But note that package-level fields can’t be annotated with @JvmField.  A.4.4  Calling Kotlin functions as Java methods  Functions declared with fun in classes can be accessed from Java as methods. Functions  declared in objects or at package level can be accessed as if they were static methods.  Consider the following MyFile.kt program file: fun method1   = "method 1"  class MyClass {      companion object {         fun method2   = "method 2"          @JvmStatic         fun method3   = "method 3"     } }  object MyObject {     fun method4   = "method 4"      @JvmStatic     fun method5   = "method 5" }  These functions can be called from Java in various ways: String s1 = MyFileKt.method1  ; String s2 = MyClass.Companion.method2  ; String s3a = MyClass.method3  ; String s3b = MyClass.Companion.method3  ; String s4 = MyObject.INSTANCE.method4  ; String s5a = MyObject.method5  ; String s5b = MyObject.INSTANCE.method5  ;  Note that MyObject.INSTANCE.method5   produces the warning message “Static mem- ber accessed via instance reference” as if you were calling a Java static method on a  class instance.   422    appendix a  Mixing Kotlin with Java  Java  caLLing       functions extension from Extension functions in Kotlin are compiled to static functions with the receiver as an additional parameter. You can call them from Java in the form to which those are com- piled. Consider the following extension function defined in a file named fun List .concat  : String = this.fold ""  { acc, s -> "$acc$s" }  MyFile.kt:  Although this function is used in Kotlin as if it were an instance function on a list of strings, you have to call it as a static method in Java: String s = MyFileKt.concat Arrays.asList "a", "b", "c"  ;      a      a  to   the  use   you   need     function with    different name  caLLing You can change the name by which a Kotlin function can be called from Java code. For this,  function. From the Java point of view, there are a few reasons to do this, and you might be forced to do this even if you never call the function from Java code. Consider the two follow- ing functions: fun List .concat  : String = this.fold ""  { acc, s -> "$acc$s" } fun List .concat  : String = this.fold ""  { acc, i -> "$acc$i" }  @JvmName "newName"   annotation   Kotlin   the   on   This won’t compile because  ¡  ¡  Kotlin functions are compiled to Java bytecode. Type erasure causes the type parameters to be removed on compilation.  As a result, these two functions are equivalent to the following Java methods: MyFileKt.concat List  list  MyFileKt.concat List  list   These two methods can’t coexist in the same class  MyFileKt  because MyFileKt.concat List list  MyFileKt.concat List list   they compile to  Even if you never call these functions from Java, you need to either put them in sep- arate files or change the compiled name of at least one of them using an annotation: fun List .concat  : String = this.fold ""  { acc, s -> "$acc$s" }  @JvmName "concatIntegers"  fun List .concat  : String = this.fold ""  { acc, i -> "$acc$i" }  Names of generated Java getters and setters for Kotlin properties can be changed in the same way: @get:JvmName "retrieveName"  @set:JvmName "storeName"  var name: String?            deaLing and vaLues defauLt with parameters In Kotlin, functions parameters can have default values. Such functions can be called from Java code but all parameters must be specified, even those with a default value.                                                                               Kotlin functions and Java code     423  The Java way for dealing with a default value is through overloading. To make the func- tion available as overloaded Java methods, use the @JvmOverloads annotation: @JvmOverloads fun computePrice price: Double,                  tax: Double = 0.20  = price *  1.0 + tax   The computePrice Kotlin function will be available in Java as Double computePrice Double price,  Double computePrice Double price, Double tax   If several parameters have default values, you won’t get all possibilities: @JvmOverloads fun computePrice price: Double,                  tax: Double = 0.20,                  shipping: Double = 8.75  = price *  1.0 + tax  + shipping  In this case, the following Java methods are available: Double computePrice Double price,  Double computePrice Double price, Double tax  Double computePrice Double price, Double tax, Double shipping   As you can see, there’s no way to pass only price and shipping and use the default value  for tax. Additionally, the @JvmOverloads annotation can also be used on constructors: class MyClass @JvmOverloads constructor name: String, age: Int = 18   deaLing with functions throwing exceptions All exceptions are unchecked in Kotlin. As a consequence, if you try to catch the excep- tion in the Java code calling a Kotlin function throwing exceptions, you’ll get a com- pile error. Consider the following Kotlin function: fun readFile filename: String : String = File filename .readText    You might want to call this function from Java in a try...catch block, such as try {   System.out.println MyFileKt.readFile "myFile"  ; } catch  IOException e  {   e.printStackTrace  ; }  But this will not compile and you’ll get the following error: Error: exception java.io.IOException is never thrown in body of corresponding   try statement  To prevent this, you need to indicate explicitly what exception is thrown, using the   @Throws annotation: @Throws IOException::class  fun readFile filename: String : String = File filename .readText    Note that the @Throws annotation is not repeatable. If your function throws several  exceptions that are checked in Java, use the following syntax:   424  appendix a  Mixing Kotlin with Java  @Throws IOException::class, IndexOutOfBoundsException::class  fun readFile filename: String : String = File filename .readText    You don’t need to indicate explicitly unchecked exception because Java lets you catch  them freely.  A.4.5  Converting types from Kotlin to Java  Kotlin makes a difference between nullable and non-nullable types; Java does not. The  difference is lost in the conversion.  Numerical types are converted either to primitives or to object types following what’s  declared on the Java side. Immutable collections are converted to Java collections. For  example, a list created with listOf in Kotlin is converted into a Java Arrays.ArrayList  in Java. Java Arrays.ArrayList is a private class in Arrays that extends AbstractList  without implementing the add method. As a consequence, if you try to add an element,  you’ll get an UnsupportedOperationException, which might make you think that the  list is unmodifiable. You can’t add or remove an element, but you can change an ele- ment by calling the set method, passing it the index of the element to replace the new  element. The immutable lists in Kotlin are far less immutable when converted to Java.  Kotlin also has specific types that don’t exist in Java:  ¡	Unit is converted to void, although it doesn’t mean exactly the same thing.  In  Kotlin, Unit is a singleton object.  By nature, it might look closer to Void  if  you’ve ever encountered this type in Java , but by its functions, it’s more equiva- lent to void.  ¡	Any is converted to Object. ¡	Nothing  isn’t  converted  because  nothing  exists  in  Java  corresponding  to  this  type. When used as a type parameter, such as Set , the conversion pro- duces a raw type  Set .  Functions  of  1  to  22  arguments  are  converted  to  special  Kotlin  types  kotlin.jvm  .functions.Function1 to kotlin.jvm.functions.Function22. These are SAM inter- faces, which makes much more sense than the Java function interfaces.  Functions  with  no  arguments  are  converted  to  kotlin.jvm.functions.Function0,  which corresponds to the Java Supplier interface.  Kotlin  functions  of  type      →  Unit  are  converted  into  instances  of  kotlin.jvm  .functions.Function0 ,  which  corresponds  to  Java  Runnable.  Function1<A,  Unit> corresponds to Java  Consumer , and  Function2  corresponds  to Java BiConsumer . Other Kotlin functions returning Unit are sort of multi-  consumers with no equivalent in Java.  You can use all the converted functions as you would do in Java, except that they all  implement a method called invoke instead of the Java apply, test, accept, or get. If  you need to convert one of these functions into a Java type, it’s easy if the corresponding   A.4.6  Function types   A.5   Specific problems with mixed Kotlin Java projects     425  exists   type  Function1   Java.

The technique presented lets you  ¡	Set up and manage a mixed project  single module or multi-module  with Gradle  or IntelliJ, including writing Gradle build scripts in Kotlin.

The main benefit is that your project descriptor is readable and  can be versioned in your code repository.  ¡	Call Java programs from Kotlin code. ¡	Call Kotlin programs from Java code.

This  controversy concerns all aspects of testing: whether to test, when you should test,  what you should test, how much you should test, how often you should test, how can  you measure the quality of tests, what the best coverage metrics are, and more. But  none of these subjects can be considered alone. And they’re nearly all dependent  on other questions that are far-less-often debated.  In this appendix, I cover how to write effective tests and how to make your pro-  gram more testable using property-based testing.

Nearly every programmer agrees that some sort of unit testing is necessary, although testing is certainly not the ideal way to ensure that programs are correct. Tests can’t prove that a program is correct.  Failing tests prove that the program is probably incorrect  only ‘probably’ because it might be a problem with the test itself ! . But successful tests certainly don’t prove that   the tested program is correct. They only prove that you haven’t been smart enough to find the bugs. If you put equal effort into developing your tests as you do into writing your programs, it still wouldn’t be enough. And still, you generally invest much less effort in testing than in writing programs.  A better way to go would be to prove that your programs are correct. This is what functional programming tries to do, but it’s seldom fully possible. The ideal program is one for which there’s only one possible implementation. That may sound crazy, but if you think about it, you’ll realize that the risk of bugs is proportional to the number of possible implementations for your programs. You should, therefore, try to minimize the number of possible implementations.  One way to do this is through abstraction. Take the example of a program that finds all elements in a list of integers that are multiples of a given one and takes the maximum of them. In traditional programming, you could do this with an indexed loop as in the following example  bugs are intentional :    example00 fun maxMultiple multiple: Int, list: List  : Int {  if  list[i]   multiple * multiple == list[i] && list[i] > result  {  var result = 0 for  i in 1 until list.size  {  result = list[i]  }  } return result  }  How would you test such a program? Of course, you see the bugs, so you’d start by fixing them before writing tests. But if you were the one responsible for these bugs, you wouldn’t see them. You’d instead want to test the implementation for limit val- ues.  0 as the   java.lang exception. The second condition would produce .ArithmeticException:   by zero a result of 0. that   two  parameter or an empty list. The first condition would cause a  implementation   parameters   The  int  probably   wouldn’t   passing   integer   empty   being   you’d   cause   Note   want   and   and   this   list,   test   list   an   an   to   to   an  0   a   exception but would produce 0 as the result.  Another bug in this example is that the first element is ignored. In a majority of  cases, this won’t cause any problems:  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡  When the list is empty. When the first parameter is 0  because you fixed the division by 0 problem . When the first element isn’t a multiple of the first parameter. When the first element is a multiple of the first parameter but not the greatest one.                                                                                                                                                   Why property-based testing?     429  Of course, you now know what to do: write a test with a nonzero first parameter and a list  in which the first element is the highest multiple. But wait … if you were smart enough  to figure that out, you wouldn’t have made this error, so testing, in this case,  isn’t useful. Some programmers say that tests should be written prior to the implementations.  Although I totally agree with this, how would it help here? You might write a test for 0  and empty lists, but how could you know in advance that you should write a test with a  nonzero first parameter and a list in which the first element is the highest multiple? You  can only do that when you know the implementation.  Testing when knowing the implementation is not ideal because if you’re the one who  wrote the implementation, you’ll be biased. On the other hand, if you’re writing tests  for an implementation you didn’t write, it can be fun to try to make it fail.  But the real game is trying to break the program without seeing the implementation.  And because you write both the test and the implementation, there’s no better moment  to write this kind of test than before starting to work on the implementation. The pro- cess should then be  1  Write the interface. 2  Write the tests. 3  Write the implementation and check if the tests pass.  Let’s look at each of these.  B.1.1  Writing the interface  B.1.2  Writing the tests  Writing the interface is easy. It consists in writing the signature of the function: fun maxMultiple multiple: Int, list: List  : Int = TODO    Now you have to write the tests. For a traditional test, you might start with    example00 test import io.kotlintest.shouldBe import io.kotlintest.specs.StringSpec  internal class MyKotlinLibraryKtTest: StringSpec   {      init {         "maxMultiple" {             val multiple = 2             val list = listOf 4, 11, 8, 2, 3, 1, 14, 9, 5, 17, 6, 7              maxMultiple multiple, list .shouldBe 14          }     } }  You can write as many tests as you want using specific values. You will, of course, treat all  the special values such as 0 and empty list, but what else can you do?   430    appendix b  Property-based testing in Kotlin  what   Generally,   programmers   the corresponding output is correct. In the previous example, you’re testing the equality between   [4, 11, 8, 2, 3, 1, 14, 9, 5, 17, 6, 7] to the tested function.  and the result of passing  choose   values   input   verify   some   that   and   and  do   14  is   2  But how did you find  14? By applying to the tuple of arguments the same process that you’ll be implementing for the function. It might fail because humans aren’t perfect. But most often it will succeed because this test consists of doing the same thing twice: once in your head and once with a computer program. This isn’t different from writing the implementation first, then running it with the given parameters, and then writing the test to verify it is the same output.       You’re   You’re testing that you wrote what you thought was the correct imple- NOTE the mentation.  problem.  the equality between the result computed by your code and the one computed in your head.

B.2   What is property-based testing? Property-based testing is testing whether the result verifies some properties in relation to the input data. For example, if you were to write a program to concatenate strings  written as  + , the properties to check might be  ¡  ¡  ¡  ¡   string1 + string2 .length == string1.length + string2.length string + "" == string "" + string == string string1.reverse    +  reverse    string2.reverse      string2   ==   +   string1 .  Testing these properties would be enough to guarantee that the program is correct.  The first three aren’t even needed.  With that, you could check millions of randomly generated strings without bothering about the actual result. The only thing that mat- ters is that the properties are verified.  The first thing you need to do before even starting coding  whether it be the main program or the tests  is to think about the problem in terms of the properties that should be verified when considering the input and the output of the function. You can immedi- ately see that a function with no side effects is much easier to deal with in that case.  your   multiple   problems,   maximum   Considering   you realize that it’s not always easy to find such properties. Remember that you must find   a set of properties that can be verified on all tuples of type   Int, List  , Int  that will be true if the last is the correct result of applying the function to the pair Int, fun maxMultiple multiple: Int, list: List  : Int = TODO    List . Here’s a reminder of the function signature:  interface,   writing   when   the   Int                                                                                                                                                                                             B.3  Abstraction and property-based tests  Abstraction and property-based tests     431  Finding some properties might seem easy, but finding significant ones is more diffi- cult.  Ideally,  you  should  find  the  smallest  set  of  properties  that  guarantees  that  the  result is correct. But you must do that without using the same logic that you’ll use for  implementing the function. Two ways of finding such properties include  ¡	Finding conditions that should hold ¡	Finding conditions that shouldn’t hold  For example, when iterating over elements in the list, you shouldn’t find one that’s  both a multiple of the first parameter and greater than the result. The problem is that  when testing this, you’d probably be using the same algorithm as when implementing  the function, so it wouldn’t be more relevant than calling the function twice and verify- ing that you get the same result on each call! The solution here is abstraction.  What you should do is find a way to abstract parts of the problem, write functions to  implement each part, and test them individually. You already know how to do this. If  you remember what you learned in chapter 5, you can see that the operation is a fold.  You can abstract the problem into two functions—the folding function and the func- tion used as the folding function’s second parameter: fun maxMultiple multiple: Int, list: List  : Int =     list.fold initialValue  { acc, int -> ... }  Here I’m using the standard Kotlin fold function working on Kotlin lists. If you prefer  to use the List you developed in chapter 5, it would be fun maxMultiple multiple: Int, list: List  : Int =     list.foldLeft initialValue  { acc -> { int -> ... } }  NOTE    In the rest of this appendix, I use standard Kotlin types.  Now you need to test the function used for the fold. As a consequence, you won’t be  using an anonymous function such as the lambda in the previous example, but rather  something like this: fun maxMultiple multiple: Int, list: List  : Int =     list.fold 0, ::isMaxMultiple   fun isMaxMultiple acc: Int, value: Int  = ...  By doing this, you’ve changed the problem into one that might be easier to test. The  reason for this is that you’ve abstracted the iteration part. And you don’t have to test  this part. It’s supposed to have been tested elsewhere. If you use the Kotlin fold func- tion, you simply trust the language. If you use the foldLeft function from chapter 5,  you’ve already tested it so you can trust it too.  IMPORTANT    You should never test a function from the language or from an  external library. If you don’t trust it, don’t use it.   432  appendix b  Property-based testing in Kotlin   The problem you need to solve now is a bit tricky. Let’s say the value for the multiple  parameter is 2. The implementation is then straightforward: fun isMaxMultiple acc: Int, elem: Int : Int =     if  elem   2 * 2 == elem && elem > acc  elem else acc  What you need to do is replace 2 with the value of the multiple parameter. Using a  local function would be possible: fun maxMultiple multiple: Int, list: List  : Int {     fun isMaxMultiple acc: Int, elem: Int : Int =         if  elem   multiple * multiple == elem && elem > acc  elem else acc     return list.fold 0, ::isMaxMultiple  }  The difficulty with such an implementation is that it doesn’t solve your testing prob- lem. Once again, abstraction is the way to go. You can abstract the multiple parameter  as follows:    example01 fun isMaxMultiple multiple: Int  =     { max: Int, value: Int ->         when {             value   multiple * multiple == value && value > max -> value             else                                                -> max         }     }  Abstraction is something you’ll always do. For example, here it’s absolutely natural for  all programmers to abstract value   multiple * multiple == value into a call to the  rem function, represented in infix notation by the % operator: fun isMaxMultiple multiple: Int  =     { max: Int, value: Int ->         when {             value % multiple == 0 && value > max -> value             else                                 -> max         }     }  Now the function can be unit tested. The isMaxMultiple function can be used in  tests as fun test value: Int, max:Int, multiple: Int : Boolean {     val result = isMaxMultiple multiple  max, value           ... check properties }  You can find several properties to test:  ¡	result >= max ¡	result % multiple == 0  result == max ¡	 result % multiple == 0 && result >= value   result % multiple != 0   Writing property based tests     433  You can also find other properties. Ideally, you should end up with the minimum set of properties that guarantees that the result is correct. In reality, it doesn’t matter much if you have some redundancy. Redundant properties are harmless  unless they take a long time to check . Missing properties are more of a problem. But a huge benefit is that you can now test your test!  B.4   Dependencies for property-based unit testing write unit tests in Kotlin, you can use various test frameworks. Most of them depend To in one way or another on well-known Java test frameworks such as JUnit. To implement property-based testing, you’ll use Kotlintest. Kotlintest relies on JUnit and adds a DSL  Domain Specific Languages  that lets you choose among many testing styles, including property-based testing. To use Kotlintest in your project, add the following line to the dependencies  block of your build.gradle file:  dependencies {  ...  }  testCompile "io.kotlintest:kotlintest-runner-junit5:${project  .rootProject.ext["kotlintestVersion"]}"   testRuntime "org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:${project  .rootProject.ext["slf4jVersion"]}"   Note the use of variables for the version numbers. Add these lines in all of your module build scripts. In order to avoid having to update version numbers in all modules, add the following definition to the build script of the parent project: ext["kotlintestVersion"] = "3.1.10" ext["slf4jVersion"] = "1.7.25"  testRuntime  The ing message, but the tests will still work.  dependency on Slf4j isn’t mandatory. If you omit it, you’ll get a warn-  Kotlintest uses Slf4j for logging and is, by default, verbose. If you don’t want logging for tests, use the to suppress logging and logging errors. You can also chose whichever logging implementation you like and provide the correspond- ing configuration to suit your needs.  dependency  slf4j-nop  B.5   Writing property based tests Tests are created in the same place as standard JUnit tests: in the src test kotlin direc- tory of each subproject. If you’re using IntelliJ, click the function to test, type Alt+Enter, and select Create Test. In the dialog box, select a version of JUnit. IntelliJ will complain that this version is absent and will propose to fix this. Ignore this error and check that the destination package is in the correct branch  java kotlin, in case of a mixed project . Change the proposed name for the class if you want, but don’t select any func- tion to test, and then click OK.

For integers, the default generator is provided by the Gen.int   function. The  previous test is then equivalent to class MyKotlinLibraryTest: StringSpec   {      init {         "isMaxMultiple" {             forAll Gen.int  , Gen.int  , Gen.int                    { multiple: Int, max:Int, value: Int ->                     isMaxMultiple multiple  max, value .let { result ->                         result >= value                             && result % multiple == 0  result == max                             &&   result % multiple == 0 && result >= value                                                    result % multiple != 0                      }             }         } }  If you specify one generator explicitly, you need to specify all. The default Gen.int    generator generates 0, Int.MAX_VALUE, Int.MIN_VALUE, and many random Int values  to make the default 1,000 tests or the number of tests specified. Each generator attempts  to generate limit values plus random values. The String generator, for example, always  generates an empty string. If you run this test, it fails with the following error message: Attempting to shrink failed arg -2147483648 Shrink 1: 0 fail Shrink result => 0  ...  java.lang.AssertionError: Property failed for Arg 0: 0  shrunk from -2147483648  Arg 1: 0  shrunk from -2147483648  Arg 2: 0  shrunk from 2147483647  after 1 attempts Caused by: expected: true but was: false Expected :true Actual   :false  This means the test has failed for some value. In such a case, Kotlintest attempts to  shrink the value in order to find the smallest value that makes the test fail.  This is useful for tests that fail when a value is too high. It wouldn’t be practical to just  report the failure. You’ll then need to try the lowest value to find the point of failure.  Here you can see that all arguments shrink to 0, without making the test pass. In fact,  the test always fails if the first argument is 0 because you can’t divide by 0.  What you need here is a generator for non-null integers. The Gen interface offers  many generators for all kinds of uses. For example, positive integers can be generated  with Gen.positiveIntegers  :    example02 test class MyKotlinLibraryTest: StringSpec   {   436  appendix b  Property-based testing in Kotlin       init {         "isMaxMultiple" {             forAll Gen.positiveIntegers  , Gen.int  , Gen.int                    { multiple: Int, max:Int, value: Int ->                     isMaxMultiple multiple  max, value .let { result ->                         result >= value                             && result % multiple == 0  result == max                             &&   result % multiple == 0 && result >= value                                                    result % multiple != 0                      }             }         } }  And now the test is a success.  B.5.1  Creating your own custom generators  Kotlintest  offers  many  generators  for  most  standard  types   numbers,  Boolean,  and  strings  as well as collections. But sometimes you’ll need to create your own generator.  The standard case is when you want to generate instances of your own classes. The pro- cess is simple. You need to implement the following interface: interface Gen  {   fun constants  : Iterable    fun random  : Sequence  }  The constants function produces the set of limit values  such as Int.MIN_VALUE, 0  and INT.MAX_VALUE for integers . Most often, you’ll make it return an empty list. The  random function returns a sequence of randomly created instances.  Creating an instance is a recursive process. If the constructor of the class you want to  generate instances of only takes parameters for which generators already exist in Gen,  just use them. For other types of parameters, use custom generators.  As much as possible, you should avoid creating a generator from scratch. All data  objects are compositions of numbers, strings, Boolean enums and, recursively, other  objects. In the end, you can generate any object by combining the existing generators.  The best way to combine generators is by using one of their bind functions, such as data class Person val name: String, val age: Int   val genPerson: Gen  =         Gen.bind Gen.string  , Gen.choose 1, 50               { name, age -> Person name, age  }  B.5.2  Using custom generators  As a use case, you might want to use a custom generator if one already exists, but you  want to avoid some specific values or you want to include a condition on the generated  values. A more uncommon but useful case is when you want to be able to maintain  some control on the generated values.   Writing property based tests     437  For example, if you need to write a program that computes the set of characters used in a string, how would you verify that the result for a randomly generated string is cor- rect? You might devise criteria to test such as  ¡  ¡  All characters in the resulting set must exist in the input string. All characters in the input string must exist in the resulting set.  This is quite simple. But imagine that instead of a set, your function has to produce a map with each character used in the string as a key in the map and the number of occurrences of that character as the value. For example, imagine you’re required to write a program that takes a list of strings and groups those that are composed of the exact same set of characters. You could write it as    example03 fun main args: Array   {  val words = listOf "the", "act", "cat", "is", "bats",  "tabs", "tac", "aabc", "abbc", "abca"   val map = getCharUsed words   println map   fun getCharUsed words: List   =  words.groupBy ::getCharMap   fun getCharMap s: String : Map  {  val result = mutableMapOf    for  i in 0 until s.length  {  val ch = s[i] if  result.containsKey ch   {  result.replace ch, result[ch]!! + 1   } else {  result[ch] = 1  }  } return result  }  }  }  This program would return the following  although on a single line : {  {t=1, h=1, e=1}=[the], {a=1, c=1, t=1}=[act, cat, tac], {i=1, s=1}=[is], {b=1, a=1, t=1, s=1}=[bats, tabs], {a=2, b=1, c=1}=[aabc, abca], {a=1, b=2, c=1}=[abbc]  test   you   your   would   program?   How  this wouldn’t guarantee it would work on all combinations. You’d better use property-based testing,  But how to devise a good set of properties? Those properties would be complex.  properties.   generating   checking   random   strings,   several   words,   some   then   and   You   lists   lists   can   but   on   try   of   of   it                                                                                  438  appendix b  Property-based testing in Kotlin   Rather than devising complex properties, you might create a generator for strings  that randomly add characters to the generated string while updating a map. When the  generation is done, the generator outputs a Pair >. With  this generated data, you only have one property to test: the map produced by the tested  program must be equal to the generated map. Here’s an example of such a generator:    example03 test val stringGenerator: Gen >>> =         Gen.list Gen.list Gen.choose 97, 122                    .map { intListList ->                     intListList.asSequence  .map { intList ->                         intList.map { n ->                             n.toChar                           }                     }.map { charList ->                         Pair String charList.toCharArray   ,                                             makeMap charList                       }.toList                   }  fun makeMap charList: List  : Map  =                         charList.fold mapOf  , ::updateMap   fun updateMap map: Map , char: Char  =  when {     map.containsKey char  -> map + Pair char, map[char]!! + 1      else -> map + Pair char, 1  }  This generator produces a sequence of list of pairs of one random string and one map  containing all characters in the string as keys and the number of occurrences of each  as values. Note that the maps aren’t obtained by analyzing the strings. The strings are  built from the same data as the maps.  Using this generator, the getCharUsed program can be easily tested because you only  have one property to test. This property is still a bit complex to read, but at least you  don’t need a huge set of properties and you’re certain that the test is exhaustive:    example03 test import io.kotlintest.properties.forAll import io.kotlintest.specs.StringSpec  class SameLettersStringKtTest: StringSpec   {      init {         "getCharUsed" {             forAll stringGenerator  {                 list: List >> ->                     getCharUsed list.map { it.first } .keys.toSet   ==                             list.asSequence  .map { it.second }.toSet               }         }     } }   Writing property based tests     439  are   the   sets   lists   that   into   before   transformed   Note  into account that the generated list of strings could contain several occurrences of the same string. The generator generates a list of up to 100 strings of up to 100 characters. If you want to parametrize these values, you might be tempted to write a new generator from scratch; for example:    example04 test class StringGenerator private val maxList: Int,  comparing.   This   take   to   is   private val maxString: Int  :  Gen >>> {  override fun constants  : Iterable >>> =  listOf listOf Pair "", mapOf       override fun random  : Sequence >>> =  Random  .let { random ->  generateSequence {   0 until random.nextInt maxList  .map {   0 until random.nextInt maxString    .fold Pair "", mapOf      { pair, _ ->   random.nextInt 122 - 96  + 96 .toChar  .let { char -> Pair "${pair.first}$char", updateMap pair.second, char    }  }  }  }  }  You can do the same for the maximum and minimum values of the characters in the generated strings. But a better way to go is to create a modified list generator: class ListGenerator  private val gen: Gen ,  private val maxLength: Int  : Gen > {  private val random = Random    override fun constants  : Iterable > =  listOf gen.constants  .toList     override fun random  : Sequence > = generateSequence {  val size = random.nextInt maxLength  gen.random  .take size .toList    }  }  override fun shrinker   = ListShrinker     This generator can then be used in the generator for strings: fun stringGenerator maxList: Int,  ListGenerator ListGenerator Gen.choose 32, 127 , maxString , maxList   maxString: Int : Gen >>> =  .map { intListList ->  intListList.asSequence  .map { intList ->  intList.map { n ->                                             440    appendix b  Property-based testing in Kotlin  n.toChar    }  }.map { charList ->  }.toList    }  Pair String charList.toCharArray   , makeMap charList    The length of the generated string could be limited by adding a filter to the outside list generator  generating the list of strings , but this would be totally inefficient because only 1 10,000,000 generated strings would pass the filter, so generation would be slow. And furthermore, this kind of filtering would only allow limiting the length of the gen- erated strings, not the length of the list of strings.  Here’s how this generator can be used:  class SameLettersStringKtTest: StringSpec   {  init {  "getCharUsed" {  forAll stringGenerator 100, 100   {  list: List >> -> getCharUsed list.map { it.first } .keys.toSet   ==  list.asSequence  .map { it.second }.toSet    }  }  }  }  Another way to solve the same testing problem is to push abstraction further as you saw in the beginning of this appendix.  B.5.3   getCharUsed  Simplifying the code through further abstraction The getCharMap  function and the   groupBy function. This function can, in fact, be further abstracted:      example05 fun getCharUsed words: List  : Map , List > =  already uses two abstractions: the  function  words.groupBy ::getCharMap   fun getCharMap s: String : Map  = s.fold mapOf  , ::updateMap   fun updateMap map: Map , char: Char : Map  =  map.containsKey char  -> map + Pair char, map[char]!! + 1  else -> map + Pair char, 1   when {  }    getCharMap  The doesn’t need to be tested, and the other is the one that needs to be tested. Finding properties to test is easy:  is    updateMap  abstractions.   function   One   uses   two   fold  which the function, which is the only  function,      containing this  char  as   a key,  getCharMap map,   char   ¡  ¡  For  any [char] For any [char]  and  map  char should be equal to char should be equal  and  map  1.  map[char] + 1. not containing this  char  as a key,  getCharMap map, char                                                                                                        Writing property based tests     441  ¡  any  and  char  For   map, char [char] no other modification is done to the map.   result  map  and from  map,   the   removing   of  getCharMap   should be equal.  This property verifies that  from  char  key   the  For this test, you’ll need to generate random maps populated with random data. You can write the following    example05 test fun mapGenerator min: Char = 'a', max: Char = 'z' : Gen > =   generating chars in the  MapGenerator  range:  [a..z]  Gen.list Gen.choose min.toInt  , max.toInt     .map Int::toChar  .map ::makeMap   And you can use it as in the following test:    example05 test class UpdateMapTest: StringSpec   {  private val random = Random    private val min = 'a'  private val max = 'z'  init {  "getCharUsed" {  forAll mapGenerator    { map: Map  ->   random.nextInt max.toInt   - min.toInt     + min.toInt   .toChar  .let {  if  map.containsKey it   {  updateMap map, it [it] == map[it]!! + 1  } else {  updateMap map, it [it] == 1  } && updateMap map, it  - it == map - it  }  }  }  }  }  Notice that the principle of maximum abstraction also applies to tests. One thing that might be abstracted is the generation of each interface doesn’t offer a generator, but you can easily create one. And because you might want to generate Char only some specific characters, you can also abstract the character selection into a sepa- rate function:    example06 test fun charGenerator p:  Char  -> Boolean : Gen  =  Char. The    Gen  Gen.choose 0, 255 .map Int::toChar .filter p   Now you can rewrite your test in a much cleaner way: class UpdateMapTest: StringSpec   {  init {  "getCharUsed" {  forAll MapGenerator, charGenerator Char::isLetterOrDigit   {                                                               442    appendix b  Property-based testing in Kotlin  map: Map , char ->  if  map.containsKey char   {  updateMap map, char [char] == map[char]!! + 1  } else {  updateMap map, char [char] == 1  } && updateMap map, char  - char == map - char  still   can   you   simplify   But  query the map for a character which isn’t found, the value should be sense because it’s the number of occurrences.  default   using   value   code   the   the   for   by   a   map.

By running the test while generating thousands of values on each build, you soon have tested your program with millions of data cases. Because both the main program and the test use the function, you should probably   put it in a common module.  updateMap  Summary In this appendix, you’ve learned how to write effective tests and make your program more testable using property-base testing.

This elegant JVM language integrates seamlessly with  Java, and makes it a breeze to switch between OO and func- tional styles of programming. It’s also fully supported by  Google as a ﬁ rst-class Android language. Master the powerful  techniques in this unique book, and you’ll be able to take on  new challenges with increased conﬁ dence and skill. The Joy of Kotlin teaches you to write comprehensible, easy-to- maintain, safe programs with Kotlin. In this expert guide, sea- soned engineer Pierre-Yves Saumont teaches you to approach  common programming challenges with a fresh, FP-inspired  perspective. As you work through the many examples, you’ll  dive deep into handling errors and data properly, managing  state, and taking advantage of laziness. The author’s down-to- earth examples and experience-driven insights will make you  a better—and more joyful—developer!
