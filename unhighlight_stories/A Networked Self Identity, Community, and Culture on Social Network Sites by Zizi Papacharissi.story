Introduction and Keynote to A  Networked Self1  Albert- László Barabási  Good morning. Today I’m going to talk about network science. My goal in the  light of the presentations we have today is to offer a rather different perspec- tive: that is, to argue that many of the things we see in the social environment  are rooted in some fundamental laws that not only social systems obey, but are  obeyed  by  a  wide  array  of  networks.  Social  systems  are  one  of  the  most  powerful examples of networks because we understand and relate to them in  an everyday fashion. In a social network the nodes are the individuals and the  links correspond to relationships—who is talking to whom, who is communi- cating  with  whom  on  a  regular  basis.  What  I  would  like  to  do  today  is  to  examine how we think about such networks. Let’s assume that you’ve been  given the full set of relationships in a social network website such as Facebook.  How would you analyze the data of such density and richness? If we think about these types of networks in mathematical terms, we have    to go back to mathematicians Pál Erdo˝s and Alfréd Rényi and the question they  asked about how to model a real network. As mathematicians, they thought of  networks in fundamentally simple terms: nodes and links. But the challenge  for these mathematicians was that they didn’t know how—in nature or soci- ety—nodes decided to link together. So Erdo˝s and Rényi made the assump- tion that links are assigned randomly, which means that any two nodes had a  certain probability of being connected, making the network a fundamentally  random object.   Since 1960, mathematicians have invested a huge amount of work in under- standing these random networks. As an illustration, if we start with a probabil- ity  of  p = 0,  which  means  that  the  probability  that  any  node  is  connected  to  another node is zero, and add new nodes while increasing the probability of a  connection by adding links to the networks, clusters will start to emerge. If  we continue to add more links to the system, at a certain moment these clus- ters will start joining each other. This is when the network actually emerges.    So there is this “magical” moment that mathematically takes us from lots of    2    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self  disconnected clusters to the emergence of what mathematicians call a “giant  component.” When networks emerge through this process, it is very sudden.  So, we find ourselves with two questions. First, is this representation of how a  network emerges correct? And second, what does it mean?   Let’s first address the “What does it mean?” question. One of the premises  of a random network is that if you count how many links each node has, which  we call the “degree of distribution” of the network, you will find a Poisson dis- tribution. This means that if Facebook was a random network, you would find  that most individuals have approximately the same number of friends, and that  there are only very few individuals who have a very large number of friends or  have no friends whatsoever. In fact, when it comes to their circle of friends,  most  individuals  would  be  similar  to  each  other.  In  a  sense,  the  random  network describes a society that is fundamentally very democratic: everyone   Bell curve  Power law distribution   b   Most nodes have the same number of links  No highly connected nodes  s k n  i l   k    h  t i  w   s e d o n    f  o    r e b m u N  Many nodes with only a few links  A few hubs with large number of links  Number of links  k    Number of links  k     d   Figure I.1   Random  and  scale-free  networks.  The  degree  distribution  of  a  random  network  follows  a  Poisson  distribution  close  in  shape  to  the  bell  curve,  telling us that most nodes have the same number of links, and that nodes  with  a  large  number  of  links  don’t  exist   a .  Thus,  a  random  network  is  similar to a national highway network in which the nodes are the cities and  the links are the major highways connecting them. Indeed, most cities are  served by roughly the same number of highways  c . In contrast, the power  law  degree  distribution  of  a  scale-free  network  predicts  that  most  nodes  have  only  a  few  links  held  together  by  a  few  highly  connected  hubs   b .  Such a network is similar to the air-traffic system, in which a large number  of  small  airports  are  connected  to  each  other  by  means  of  a  few  major  hubs  d .   a   s k n  i l   k    h  t i  w   s e d o n    f  o    r e b m u N   c    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self    3  has  roughly  the  same  number  of  friends,  and  it’s  very  difficult  to  find  indi- viduals that are significantly richer or significantly poorer in the terms of their  social ties than the average person. So, despite the randomness by which the  links  are  placed,  the  randomness  gets  averaged  out,  and  in  the  end  we  all  become very similar to each other.   Now, we need to question whether this is correct. Do we honestly believe  that  real  networks—society,  the  Internet,  or  other  systems—are  truly  random,  decided  by  chance?  No  one  would  question  that  there  is  a  large  degree  of  randomness  in  the  way  we  make  friends  and  in  the  way  certain  things  are  connected.  But  is  that  all,  or  is  there  more  to  it?  To  answer  this  question, about a decade ago we started to collect large data sets, large maps  of networks, with the idea that we needed to examine real networks to under- stand how they actually worked. Our first choice was the World Wide Web, a  large network where nodes and documents were linked using URLs. It wasn’t  a  philosophical  decision,  it  was  simply  available  data  that  we  could  actually  map out. We started in 1999 from the main page of University of Notre Dame  and followed the links. Then we followed the links on the pages we reached.  It was a terribly boring process, so we built a software to do this—these days,  it  is  called  a  search  engine.  But  unlike  Google,  who  runs  similar  search  engines, we didn’t care about the content of the pages. We only cared about  the links and what they were actually connected to. So at the end of the day,  this robot returned a map in which each node corresponds to a Web page and  the links tell you the connection to another page that can be made with a single  click.   What  was  our  expectation?  Well,  Web  pages  are  created  by  individuals  who  significantly  differ  from  one  another.  Some  people  care  about  social  systems. Others care about the Red Sox or the White Sox, and still others care  about Picasso. And what people put on Web pages reflect these personal inter- ests. Given the huge differences between us, it’s reasonable to expect that a  very  large  network  would  have  a  certain  degree  of  randomness.  And  we  expected  that  when  we  counted  how  many  links  each  Web  page  had,  the  network  would  follow  Poisson  distribution,  as  predicted  by  the  random  network model. Surprisingly, however, our results showed something differ- ent. We found a large number of very small nodes with only a few links each,  and a few very highly connected nodes. We found what we call a “power law  distribution.” That is, P k  ~ k–γ where P k  is the probability that a node has k  links and is called the “degree exponent.”   What is a power law distribution? A power law distribution appears on a  regular  plot  as  a  continuously  and  gradually  decreasing  curve.  Whereas  a  Poisson distribution has an exponentially decaying tail, one that drops off very  sharply, a power law distribution has a much slower decay rate resulting in a    4    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self  long tail. This means that not only are there numerous small nodes, but that  these numerous small nodes coexist with a few very highly connected nodes,  or hubs.   To illustrate, a random network would look similar to the highway system  of the United States, where the cities are the nodes and the links are the high- ways connecting them. Obviously, it doesn’t make sense to build a hundred  highways going into a city, and each major city in the mainland U.S. is con- nected by a highway. So if you were to draw a histogram of the number of  major highways that meet in major cities, you would find the average to be  around two or three. You wouldn’t find any city that would have a very large  number of highways going in or out. In comparison, a map of airline routes  shows many tiny airports and a few major hubs that have many flights going in  and out; these hubs hold the whole network together. The difference between  these two types of networks is the existence of these hubs. The hubs funda- mentally  change  the  way  the  network  looks  and  behaves.  These  differences  become more evident when we think about travel from the east coast to west  coast.  If  you  go  on  the  highway  system,  you  need  to  travel  through  many  major cities. When you fly, you fly to Chicago and from Chicago you can reach  just about any other major airport in the U.S. The way you navigate an airline  network  is  fundamentally  different  from  the  way  you  navigate  the  highway  system, and it’s because of the hubs.   So we saw that the Web happens to be like the airline system. The hubs are  obvious—Google,  Yahoo,  and  other  websites  everybody  knows—and  the  small nodes are our own personal Web pages. So the Web happens to be this  funny animal dominated by hubs, what we call a “scale- free network.” When I  say “scale- free network,” all I mean is that the network has a power law distri- bution; for all practical purposes you can visualize a network as dominated by  a  few  hubs.  So  we  asked,  is  the  structure  of  the  Web  unique,  or  are  there  other networks that have similar properties?   Take  for  example  the  map  of  the  Internet.  Despite  the  fact  that  in  many  people’s minds the Internet and Web are used interchangeably, the Internet is  very different from the Web because it is a physical network. On the Web, it  doesn’t  cost  any  more  money  to  connect  with  somebody  who  is  next  door  than  it  does  to  connect  to  China.  But  with  the  Internet,  placing  a  cable  between here and China is quite an expensive proposition.   On the Internet the nodes correspond to routers and the links correspond  to physical cables. Yet, if one inspects any map of the Internet, we see a couple  of  major  hubs  that  hold  together  many,  many  small  nodes.  These  hubs  are  huge routers. Actually, the biggest hub in the United States is in the Midwest,  in  a  well- guarded  underground  facility.  We’ll  see  why  in  a  moment.  Thus,  like the Web, the Internet is also a hub- dominated structure. I want to empha-   Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self    5  size that the Web and the Internet are very different animals. Yet, when you  look  at  their  underlying  structures,  and  particularly  if  you  mathematically  analyze them, you will find that they are both scale- free networks.   Let’s take another example. I’m sure everybody here is familiar with the  Kevin  Bacon  game,  where  the  goal  is  to  connect  an  actor  to  Kevin  Bacon.  Actors are connected if they appeared in a movie together. So Tom Cruise has  a Kevin Bacon number one because they appeared together in A Few Good Men.  Mike Myers never appeared with Kevin Bacon—but he appeared with Robert  Wagner in The Spy Who Shagged Me, and Robert Wagner appeared with Kevin  Bacon  in  Wild  Things.  So  he’s  two  links  away.  Even  historical  figures  like  Charlie  Chaplin  or  Marilyn  Monroe  are  connected  by  two  to  three  links  to  Bacon. There is a network behind Hollywood, and you can analyze the histor- ical data from all the movies ever made from 1890 to today to study its struc- ture.  Once  again,  if  you  do  that,  you  will  find  exactly  the  same  power  law  distribution as we saw earlier. Most actors have only a few links to other actors  but  there  are  a  few  major  hubs  that  hold  the  whole  network  together.  You  may not know the names of the actors with few links because you walked out  of the movie theater before their name came up on the screen. On the other  hand there are the hubs, the actors you go to the movie theater to see. Their  names are on the ads and feature prominently on the posters.   Let’s  move  to  the  subject  of  this  conference,  online  communities.  Here,  the nodes are the members. And though we don’t know who they are, their  friends do, and these relationships with friends are the links. There are many  ways  to  look  at  these  relationships.  One  early  study  from  2002  examined  email  traffic  in  a  university  environment,  and  sure  enough,  a  scale- free  network emerged there as well. Another studied a pre- cursor to Facebook, a  social  networking  site  in  Sweden,  and  exactly  the  same  kind  of  distribution  arose  there.  No  matter  what  measure  they  looked  at,  whether  people  just  poked  each  other,  traded  email,  or  had  a  relationship,  the  same  picture  emerged: most people had only few links and a few had a large number.   But  all  the  examples  I  have  given  you  so  far  came  from  human- made  systems, which may suggest that the scale- free property is rooted in something  we  do.  We  built  the  Internet,  the  Web,  we  do  social  networking,  we  do  email. So perhaps these hubs emerge as something intrinsic in human behav- ior. Is it so?   Let’s talk about what’s inside us. One of the many components in humans  is genes, and the role of the genes is to generate proteins. Much of the dirty  work in our cells is done not by the genes, but by the proteins. And proteins  almost  never  work  alone.  They  always  interact  with  one  another  in  what  is  known as protein–protein interaction. For example, if you look in your blood  stream, oxygen is carried by hemoglobin. Hemoglobin essentially is a molecule    6    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self  made of four proteins that attach together and carry oxygen. The proteins are  nodes in a protein–protein interaction network, which is crucial to how the  cell actually works. When it’s down, it brings on disease. There’s also a meta- bolic network inside us, which takes the food that you eat and breaks it down  into  the  components  that  the  cells  can  consume.  It’s  a  network  of  chemical  reactions. So the point is that there are many networks in our cells. On the  left- hand side of this figure is the metabolic network of the simple yeast organ- ism.  On  the  right- hand  side  is  the  protein–protein  interaction  network.  In  both cases, if you analyze them mathematically you will observe a scale- free  network; visually you can see the hubs very clearly.  Figure I.2   Protein interaction network of yeast, an organism often studied in biologi- cal labs. Each node corresponds to a protein and two proteins are linked  together  if  there  is  experimental  evidence  that  they  interact  with  each  other in the cell. The color of the nodes denote their essentiality: dark grey  proteins are those without which the organism cannot survive, while light  grey are those that the organism can live without.  Note the uneven link  distribution:  most  proteins  link  to  one  or  a  few  nodes  only,  while  a  few  proteins act as hubs, having links to dozens of other proteins.   Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self    7      When  you  think  about  it,  this  is  truly  fascinating  because  these  networks  have  emerged  through  a  four- billion-year  evolution  process.  Yet  they  con- verge to exactly the same structure that we observe for our social networks,  which  raises  a  very  fundamental  question.  How  is  it  possible  that  cells  and  social networks can converge with the same architecture?   One of the goals of this talk is to discuss the laws and phenomena that are  recurrent in different types of networks, summarizing them as organizing prin- ciples.  The  first  such  organizing  principle  is  the  scale- free  property  which  emerges in a very large number of networks. For our purposes, it just simply  means  that  many  small  nodes  are  held  together  by  a  few  major  hubs.  Yet,  there is a second organizing property that many of you may be aware of, often  called  either  the  “six  degrees”  or  the  “small  world”  phenomenon.  The  idea  behind it is very straightforward: you pick two individuals and try to connect  them.  For  example,  Sarah  knows  Ralph,  Ralph  knows  Jason,  Jason  knows  Peter, so you have a three- handshake distance between Sarah and Peter. This  phenomenon was very accurately described in 1929 by the Hungarian writer  Frigyes Karinthy, in a short story that was published in English about two years  ago and translated by a professor at UIC, Professor Adam Makkai. The idea  entered the scientific literature in 1967 thanks to the work of Stanley Milgram,  who popularized the “six degrees of separation” phrase after following the path  of letters sent out from a particular town.   No matter what network you look at, the typical distances are short. And  by short we mean that the average separation between the nodes is not a func- tion  of  how  many  nodes  the  network  has,  but  rather  the  logarithm  of  the  number of nodes, which is a relatively small number. This is not a property of  social networks only. We see it in the Web. We see it in the cell. We see it in  all  different  types  of  networks.  The  small  world  phenomenon  is  important  because it completely destroys the notion of space. Indeed, two people can be  very far away if you measure their physical distance. And yet, when you look  at the social distance between them, it is typically relatively short.   Now  let’s  come  back  to  the  central  question  that  I  raised  earlier.  I  have  given  several  examples  of  networks  that  were  documented  to  be  scale- free.  How  is  it  possible  that  such  different  systems—the  Web,  the  Internet,  the  cell,  and  social  networks—develop  a  common  architecture?  What’s  missing  from the random network model that doesn’t allow us to capture the features  of these networks? Why are hubs in all these networks?   To answer these questions, we must return to the random model, to Erdo˝s  and Rényi’s hypothesis, which contains several assumptions that you might not  have noticed. Their model depicts a society of individuals by placing six billion  dots  on  a  screen  and  connecting  them  randomly.  But  their  fundamental  assumption  is  that  the  number  of  nodes  remains  unchanged  while  you  are    8    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self  making the connections. And I would argue that this is not necessarily correct.  The networks we see have always gone through, and continue to go through,  an  expansion  process.  That  is,  they  are  always  adding  new  nodes,  and  this  growth is essential to the network.   Let’s inspect the Web. In 1991 there was only one Web page out there,  Tim Berners- Lee’s famous first page. And now we have more than a trillion.  So how do you go from one to more than a trillion nodes? The answer is one  node at a time, one Web page at a time, one document at a time, whether a  network  expands  slowly  or  fast,  or  does  so  node- by-node.  So  if  we  are  to  model  the  Web,  we  can’t  just  simply  put  up  a  trillion  nodes  and  connect  them. We need to reproduce the process by which the network emerged in  the first place. How would we do that? Well you assume that there is growth  in  the  system,  by  starting  with  a  small  network  and  adding  new  nodes,  and  somehow connecting the new nodes to existing nodes.   The next question that comes up right away: how do we choose where to  connect  the  node?  Erdo˝s  and  Rényi  actually  gave  us  the  recipe.  They  said,  choose it randomly. But this is an assumption that is not borne out by our data.  It turns out that new nodes prefer to link to highly connected nodes. The Web  is the best example. There are a trillion pages out there. How many do you  know personally? A few hundred, maybe a thousand? We all know Google and  Yahoo, but we’re much less aware of the rest of the trillion which are not so  highly connected. So our knowledge is biased toward pages with more con- nections.  And  when  we  connect,  we  tend  to  follow  our  knowledge.  This  is  what we call “preferential attachment” and simply means that we can connect  to any node, but we’re more likely to connect to a node with a higher degree   Figure I.3   Birth  of  a  scale-free  network.  The  scale-free  topology  is  a  natural  con- sequence of the ever-expanding nature of real networks. Starting from two  connected nodes  top left , in each panel a new node, which is shown as an  open  dot,  is  added  to  the  network.  When  deciding  where  to  link,  new  nodes  prefer  to  attach  to  the  more  connected  nodes.  Thanks  to  growth  and preferential attachment, a few highly connected hubs emerge.   Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self    9  than to one with a smaller degree. It’s probabilistic: the likelihood of me con- necting  to  a  certain  Web  page  is  proportional  to  how  many  links  that  page  already has. This is often called the “Matthew Effect” from Merton’s famous  paper, and is also sometimes called “cumulative advantage.” The bottom line is  that there is a bias toward more connected nodes. If one node has many more  links than another, new nodes are much more likely to connect to it. So, big  nodes will grow faster than less connected nodes.   One of the most beautiful discoveries of random network theory is that if  we keep adding links randomly, at a certain moment a large network will sud- denly emerge. But the model discussed above suggests a completely different  phenomenon: the network exists from the beginning, and we just expand it.  There  is  no  magic  moment  of  the  emergence  of  the  network.  In  evolving  network theory, we look at the evolution of the system rather than the sudden  emergence of the system. So if we take this model and grow many nodes, you  will find that the emerging network will be scale- free and the hubs will natu- rally emerge. This is the third organizing principle: hubs emerge via growth  and preferential attachment.   Now let’s be realistic. There are lots of other things going on in a complex  networked  system  in  addition  to  those  I  have  just  described.  One  thing  we  learned mathematically is that as long as the network is growing, and as long as  there  is  some  process  that  generates  preferential  attachment,  a  network  is  scale- free. Thus, one of the reasons there are so many different networks that  are scale- free is because the criteria for their emergence is so minimal.   The  next  question  that  naturally  comes  up  concerns  one  of  this  model’s  predictions: the earliest nodes in the network become the biggest hubs. And  the later the arrival, the less chance a node has to become big. There is way of  mathematically expressing this occurrence: each node increases its degree as  the square root of time. This means that the longer you are in the system, the  more connected you are. So, can any of us become hubs if we are late- comers?  Well,  there  are  obvious  examples  of  this  happening.  Google  was  a  relative  latecomer to the WWW and yet it’s the biggest hub today. So, how can you  be a late- comer and become very highly connected? Is there a mechanism for  this?   One way to describe the Google phenomenon is with the concept of fitness.  What is fitness? Fitness is the node’s ability to attract links. It’s not the likeli- hood of finding a Web page, but rather once you’ve found a Web page, it’s  the probability that you will connect to it. It’s not the chance of running into a  person.  But  once  you’ve  met  the  person,  will  you  want  to  see  him  or  her  again? Thus, fitness is the ability to attract links after these random encounters.  To  model  the  impact  of  fitness,  we  assign  a  parameter  for  each  node  which  represents its ability to compete for links. You can build it into preferential    10    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self  attachment, because now the likelihood that you will connect to a certain node  is the product of the fitness and the number of links. The number of links is  there because it tells us how easy it is to find the node. If a node is very highly  connected, it is easy to bump into it. But the fitness tells me the likelihood that  I will actually link to it, once I find it. If  you  solve  this  fitness- driven  model  analytically,  you  will  find  that  each    node will increase its links following a power law, but the exponent by which  the  node  grows  is  unique  to  the  node.  What  does  this  mean?  It  means  that  there’s a possibility for a node to come in late with a higher fitness and grow  faster than the earlier- arriving nodes. Now, if the fitness of the new node is  only marginally higher than the other nodes, it will take a long time to catch  up. But if it’s significantly higher, then the node will actually grow larger than  any of the others. One of the reasons it’s so hard to beat Google today—that  is, to grow as large as Google is as a late- comer—is that there has to be a sig- nificantly higher fitness to overcome the time lag.   Fitness also makes a somewhat disturbing prediction, allowing for the pos- sibility of a “winner takes all” situation. In the language of physics, this is what  we  call  a  “Bose–Einstein  condensation,”  and  simply  means  that  a  node  with  significantly higher fitness will grab all the links. As the network grows, this  node  will  completely  dominate  the  system,  much  more  so  than  a  hub  in  a  scale- free  network.  Let  me  explain  the  difference  between  a  scale- free  network  and  a  “winner  takes  all”  network.  In  a  scale- free  network,  as  the  network expands, the market share of the biggest hub will decrease in time.  That is, even though the biggest hub will get larger and larger, the fraction of  the total links in the full network that connect to it will slowly decay. In a case  where you have a “winner takes all” situation, the market share of the biggest  hub  will  remain  constant.  An  example  is  the  Windows  operating  system,  which has an 85% market share in operating systems. That’s a winner takes all  situation because its share has stayed relatively constant over that of Apple and  Linux.  So,  to  summarize,  competition  in  networks  is  driven  by  fitness;  the  fittest nodes are the ones who will turn slowly into hubs. So it’s very import- ant to think about where fitness comes from. And, obviously, if you want to  compete, you need to think about how to increase your fitness.   The next questions that come up are, “So what—should we even care?” and  “Do these hubs have any consequences that are important?” It turns out that  there are many consequences. One is illustrated by the concept of robustness,  which means that complex systems maintain their basic functions even under  errors and failures. For example, in my cells there are many errors. Yet I can  carry on speaking, despite the fact that something in my cells has gone wrong.  Another example is the Internet, where at any time hundreds of routers are  not working, yet the Internet still functions. So how do we think about the    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self    11  concept of robustness in the network context? Well, we can model a network  and see what happens when a couple of nodes break down or disappear from  the system. For a very large random network, we can delete randomly chosen  nodes  to  see  how  the  network  will  support  that  process.  There  is  a  very  precise mathematical prediction about random networks that says that if you  start removing nodes, you will reach a critical point at which the network will  fall apart. That is, every random network and every regular network, like a  square  lattice  or  triangular  lattice,  will  have  this  critical  point.  By  removing  more  nodes  than  this  critical  threshold,  the  network  will  break  apart;  it  is  unavoidable.   What happens in a scale- free network? It turns out that we can remove a  significant  fraction  of  the  nodes  without  breaking  it  apart.  What’s  going  on  here? By randomly removing the nodes, in a scale- free network we are typic- ally removing small nodes, because there are so many of them. The probability  of removing a hub is very low, as there are only a few hubs. Yet, removing a  small  node  just  means  the  network  becomes  slightly  smaller.  It  shrinks,  but  doesn’t fall apart. In fact, we can remove 98% of the nodes in a large scale-  free network, and the remaining 2% will stay together and continue to com- municate.  There  is  a  built- in  robustness  to  this  network  because  of  the  hubs—but there’s also a price to pay. What if we remove nodes not randomly,  but in an attack mode? That is, we remove the biggest hub, the next biggest  hub, and so on. In this case the network breaks into pieces very quickly. Scale-  free  networks  have  this  amazing  property  of  robustness  to  random  failures,  but they are also very fragile. If we know what the system looks like, we can  destroy it very easily. This is why the Midwest router is so heavily protected.  And so our fourth organizing property of scale- free networks becomes robust- ness against failure with vulnerability to attack.   What about communities within networks? We know that most networks  are full of communities or groups of nodes that tend to connect more to each  other  than  we  would  expect  randomly.  We  can  visualize  these  as  groups  of  people  in  the  same  class  or  department,  who  all  know  each  other.  But  the  existence of these communities produces a tension with the scale- free prop- erty  of  networks.  The  scale- free  property  suggests  that  we  have  a  few  hubs  that hold the whole network together, and the communities suggest that there  are relatively isolated groups of nodes that work independently.   So  can  we  bring  the  two  together?  It  turns  out  we  can,  but  it  implies  another constraint on the network, what we call a “hierarchical network.” To  illustrate  a  hierarchical  network,  let’s  begin  with  a  small  community  and  create  four  copies  of  it,  connecting  each  with  the  previous  one.  Repeat  this  again and again. It turns out that this network has a hierarchical structure that  can  be  mathematically  measured.  It  has  signatures  that  are  present  in  many    12    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self  networks—social  networks,  the  Web,  and  the  Internet.  The  smaller  com- munities  are  highly  interconnected,  while  the  larger  communities  are  less  dense. As communities get larger, they become less dense and they connect to  each other in a hierarchical fashion.   Networks  exist  for  a  reason.  They  spread  ideas;  they  spread  knowledge;  they spread influence. What happens if you give a piece of information to an  individual, who passes it on to friends, who then pass it on to their friends,  and so on? What does this information network look like? Let me show you an  example. This figure shows a small neighborhood in a fully anonymized phone   Weak links  Strong links  Community  Figure I.4   A mobile phone network, where each node is a mobile phone number and  two  nodes  are  connected  if  they  have  called  each  other.  The  link  shade  denotes the frequency and the duration of the calls—dark links denote fre- quent  interactions   strong  links ,  while  light  grey  links  are  those  that  are  hardly used  weak links . Note the presence of obvious communities, and  that the strong ties tend to be located within these communities, in con- trast  with  the  weak  ties,  that  tend  to  be  linking  different  communities  together, in line with Granovetter’s weak tie hypothesis   Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self    13  data survey for approximately 10 million individuals. We know exactly when  each user called, who they called, and so on. You can see, in fact, that there  are  almost  invisible  links  that  connect  different  groups  together;  these  are  weak links and they are highlighted in light grey. There are some communities  that  are  highly  interconnected,  and  these  links  are  highlighted  in  dark  grey.  Recalling the concept of the strength of weak ties from Mark Granovetter, this  figure shows that the strong ties are indeed within the communities, and the  weak ties are used mainly to connect communities together.   What we don’t see, however, is that the weak ties matter for information  transfer. In this figure, though we have a fundamental perception of communi- cation, we really don’t know the strength of the ties. But in the full network  we do: we can simply look at how often each individual speaks with another  and assign a weight between them based on the frequency and the time spent  together on the phone. If we do this, we can create a weighted network. As a  comparison, we can generate a second network, a reference network, where  the  average  weighted  link  is  exactly  the  same  as  the  empirical  network,  but  where every connection between the nodes has the same weight. Now, if we  model a piece of information spreading through each of these two networks,  we find that information spreads much more slowly in the empirical network  than in the reference network. This is in complete agreement with Granovet- ter’s  theory:  information  gets  stuck  in  the  communities  and  takes  time  to  spread because ties between communities are weak.   But  from  an  individual’s  perspective,  where  does  new  information  come  from?  Does  it  typically  spread  through  weak  ties  from  one  community  to  another,  or  will  it  come  from  a  strong  tie  within  the  community?  If  all  the  links are equal, new information arrives to the individual from the ties that are  normally weak. It very rarely comes from the strong ties. When we add the  real  weights  to  the  links,  however,  we  find  that  information  doesn’t  come  from  either  the  weak  ties  or  the  strong  ties;  it  arrives  through  intermediate  ties. The reason is simple. People rarely use their weak ties because they very  rarely  communicate  through  them.  It  takes  forever  for  you  to  get  in  touch  with the person you are weakly connected to. Information doesn’t come from  the strong ties either, though, because strong ties are part of groups where all  individuals have the same information. We find that information comes from  somewhere in between. We call this the “weakness of weak and strong ties in  social systems.”   So to wrap this up, today I’ve outlined some of the distinctive properties  that recur in networks. But what really is network science? From my perspec- tive, it’s an attempt to understand the networks emerging in nature, techno- logy, and society using a unified set of tools and principles. It is a new field and  a  new  discipline,  and  what  really  excites  me  is  that  despite  recurring    14    Introduction and Keynote to A Networked Self  differences, many real networks evolve through a fundamental set of laws and  mechanisms. Whether you study a particular domain—the Internet, biological  networks, or social networks and communities—your primary goal may not  be to discover these organizing possibilities. But we need to be aware that our  systems respect these laws and mechanisms, this underlying architecture. And  if you understand that, I am convinced that we can have a much more mean- ingful discussion about each of our favorite networks. Thank you.  1.

Part I  Context Communication Theory and  Social Network Sites    Chapter 1 Interaction of Interpersonal,  Peer, and Media Influence  Sources Online A Research Agenda for Technology  Convergence  Joseph B. Walther, Caleb T. Carr,   Scott Seung W. Choi, David C. DeAndrea,  Jinsuk Kim, Stephanie Tom Tong, and  Brandon Van Der Heide  Developments in communication technologies are raising new questions and  resurrecting old questions about the interplay of interpersonal, mass, and peer  communication.  Questions  about  the  interplay  of  mass  media  and  interper- sonal processes are not altogether new. Yet new communication technologies  demand a revised view of mass and interpersonal processes. New technologies  blur  the  boundaries  between  interpersonal  and  mass  communication  events  and or the roles that communicators take on using new systems. Arguments  have been made that the “convergence” of old and new media demands new  and unified perspectives on traditionally segregated processes.   Some  of  the  questions  about  the  convergence  of  communication  sources  deserve reconsideration in light of recent technological developments, many of  which were unforeseen when previous pronouncements were articulated, that  change relationships of mass and interpersonal sources. More specifically, some  new  communication  technologies  are  changing  the  manner  of  reception  by  which  individuals  acquire  information  from  institutional,  interpersonal,  and  peer  information  sources.  Technology  changes  the  temporal  and  contiguous  presentations of these sources, and may in fact change the information process- ing  and  social  influence  dynamics  among  these  sources;  that  is,  the  sequence  with which sources are sampled or the simultaneousness with which they appear  may have potent effects on the information processing filters and biases.   “Media convergence” is a term that has been used to connote several phe- nomena that are brought about by advancements in telecommunication tech- nology that may change some aspect of the communication process. Sometimes  the  term  refers  to  the  blending  of  previously  individuated  mass  media:  One  can  watch  movies  on  one’s  computer,  for  example.  We  wish  to  discuss    18    Context  another kind of convergence: The potential for simultaneous communication  via  computers  of  both  conceptually  mass  and  interpersonal  channels.  For  example, one can examine the NYTimes.com while chatting about its content  with  a  friend  via  Instant  Messenger;  one  can  draw  political  news  from  a  blogger, and post an individual reaction on that blog as a comment. Moreover,  in addition to mass and interpersonal sources, new communication technology  has  made  incredibly  salient  another  information source,  virtual  communities  and other forms of peer- generated information, which is accessible at a previ- ously impossible level. This addition may further affect the balance of sources  of social influence in several settings.   How  these  information  streams  influence  individuals,  of  course,  is  not  a  magic bullet. We believe that in many cases a deeper understanding of the use  and influence of these sources may be derived through a renewed focus on the  interpersonal goals that may drive users’ information- seeking and processing.  How these new juxtapositions of institutional, peer, and interpersonal sources  may change information- processing patterns, and effects of information con- sumption will have much to do with the interplay of motives that drive par- ticular interactions.   Technology has also generated new forms of communication, in social net- working  sites  and  other  systems,  which  bridge  the  structural  and  functional  characteristics of mass interpersonal peer communication. Such technologies  invite research that will advance understanding of how individuals conceptual- ize  communication,  instantiate  communication  strategies,  and  interpret  new  mediated message forms and content.   The purposes of the present work are several. First, we revisit approaches  to the division and interaction of mass and interpersonal communication proc- esses, to see what questions and assertions have been raised that may continue  to guide understanding of these processes as they unfold via new technologies.  Second, we will attempt to articulate an expanded perspective on the interplay  of institutional, peer, and interpersonal sources through contemporary com- munication  technologies,  and  to  articulate  research  agendas  that  can  help  in  understanding  of  the  information- processing  patterns  that  such  convergent  forms make likely. Third, we identify new forms and functions of mediated  communication that challenge previous classifications, in order to invoke prin- ciples that may focus research to help explain these new phenomena.  Perspectives on Mass Interpersonal Divisions  and Mergers  Traditionally, mass communication processes have been conceptualized as one-  way message transmissions from one source to a large, relatively undifferentiated    Interpersonal, Peer, and Media Influence Sources    19  and  anonymous  audience.  Interpersonal  communication  involves  smaller  numbers  of  participants  who  exchange  messages  designed  for,  and  directed  toward, particular others. Interpersonal communication has been considered a  two- way message exchange between two or more individuals in which com- munication strategies are shaped by the instrumental and relational goals of the  individuals involved, and knowledge about one another’s idiosyncratic prefer- ences  see for review Berger & Chaffee, 1989; Cappella, 1989 .   Several  landmark  works  involve  both  mass  communication  and  interper- sonal  processes  to  render  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  particular  phe- nomena.  The  manner  in  which  most  people  form  and  change  opinions  of  politics, style, and other cultural issues is well- known to involve mass media  messages and interpersonal discussions  e.g., Katz, 1957; Katz & Lazarsfeld,  1955;  Lazarsfeld,  Berelson,  &  Gaudet,  1944 .  Similarly,  the  integration  of  mass and interpersonal processes is necessary in order to understand the diffu- sion of innovations, a communication process that incorporates both mass and  interpersonal communication in its very conceptualization  Reardon & Rogers,  1988 .   Despite their organic relationship in some contexts, a review of their con- ceptual  and  disciplinary  differences  shows  that  the  exploration  of  mass  and  interpersonal processes often takes place in isolation of one another. This sepa- ration helps to make clear how they operate together when they do, as well as  to set the stage for consideration of their interactions, mergers, and or conver- gences. Several commentators have illuminated the causes and consequences of  a disciplinary divide between mass and interpersonal communication research.  Wiemann,  Hawkins,  and  Pingree   1988   attributed  the  division  to  historical  and academic bureaucratic differences. Reardon and Rogers  1988  argued that  the division developed as a result of scholars’ efforts to define their distinctive  contributions to social science. Interpersonal scholars followed the tradition of  psychology and social psychology from the 1920s–1930s. Key sources such as  Heider’s  1958  Psychology of Interpersonal Relations and the approaches employed  by  psychologists,  sociologists,  and  anthropologists  such  as  Argyle,  Goffman,  and  Bateson,  respectively,  helped  to  solidify  the  relevance  of  social  scientific  research  on  face- to-face  interaction  and  relationships   Reardon  &  Rogers,  1988 ,  leading  to  the  sub- area  of  interpersonal  communication.  Mass  media  research  evolved  primarily  from  sociology  and  political  science   Reardon  &  Rogers, 1988 . Mass media research examined how mediated messages affect  large audiences. These alternative sub- areas allowed scholars to focus, define,  and justify their academic endeavors.   Despite its historical utility, this division has been lamented for a variety of  reasons. The most prevalent concern is a lack of synthesis between mass and  interpersonal  communication  in  terms  of  the  theories  and  research  methods    20    Context  that  have  developed  under  alternative  foci,  to  the  extent  that  scholars  with  functionally  similar  interests  may  not  be  aware  of  the  scientific  work  being  performed  outside  of  their  area  of  specialization   Berger  &  Chaffee,  1988;  Pingree,  Wiemann,  &  Hawkins,  1988;  Reardon  &  Rogers,  1988 .  Cross-  disciplinary  integration  can  expand  understanding  and  contribute  to  more  comprehensive  approaches  to  measurement,  critics  argue,  as  well  as  surface  for greater scrutiny underlying assumptions inherent in individual specializa- tions  Pingree et al., 1988 . Berger and Chaffee  1988  argued that theorizing  with a common purpose is the way to unify the field as a whole. Subfields pur- suing similar issues without the knowledge of one another can lead to greater  division and weakened theoretical results, whereas shared purposes, language,  and  research  areas  can  provide  frameworks  for  the  creation  of  new  theories  that examine processes of communication as a whole.   In addition to these general arguments for a merger of mass and interper- sonal  research  approaches,  advocates  have  argued  that  new  communication  technologies  have  the  potential  to  merge  the  very  processes  conventionally  considered as pertaining to mass communication or interpersonal communica- tion, and that the merger of processes demands the merger of approaches in  order  to  understand  such  phenomena.  For  example,  Reardon  and  Rogers   1988  suggested that new interactive media did not neatly fit into preexisting  areas of study. They claimed that a new epistemological approach to commu- nication research may be needed. Several observers suggested that new tech- nologies  defy  easy  categorization  as  either  interpersonal  or  mass  media  channels  because  of  their  interactive  nature   Cathcart  &  Gumpert,  1986;  Newhagen  &  Rafaeli,  1996;  O’Sullivan,  1999,  2005;  Pingree  et  al.,  1988;  Reardon  &  Rogers,  1988 .  Thus,  commentators  hold  out  hope  that  “this  technological change may facilitate a long- needed paradigm shift in communi- cation science”  Reardon & Rogers, 1988, p.  297  since analytic approaches  from  mass  or  interpersonal  communication  traditions  may  be  insufficient  to  grasp the effects of new technologies in communication dynamics.   Cathcart and Gumpert’s  1986  initial exploration into the mass personal  merger led them to speculate about a “new typology” they termed “mediated  interpersonal  communication”  which  they  defined  as  “any  person- to-person  interaction where a medium has been interposed to transcend the limitations  of time and space”  p. 30 . They argued that new analytics are needed for such  forms  since  the  interposition  of  media  changes  the  quality  and  quantity  of  information exchanged, influences personal behaviors and attitudes, and shapes  an individual’s self image. Some 20 years later, without a new typology per se,  the  study  of  computer- mediated  communication   CMC   has  done  much  to  flesh  out  a  number  of  issues  that  Cathcart  and  Gumpert  identified   see,  for  review, Walther, 2006 .   Interpersonal, Peer, and Media Influence Sources    21    Likewise,  O’Sullivan   1999,  p.  580   argued  that  “The  functional  conver- gence  of  mass  and  interpersonal  channels,  perhaps  best  represented  by  the  Internet, is both a challenge and an opportunity for scholars to pursue conver- gence of the two areas of study.” More recently, O’Sullivan  2005  suggested  that there are and have been unique blends of “masspersonal” communication,  not only in Internet forms but through unconventional appropriations of con- ventional media, when individuals use traditional mass communication chan- nels for interpersonal communication, traditional interpersonal communication  channels for mass communication, and new communication channels to gener- ate  mass  communication  and  interpersonal  communication  simultaneously.  One  recalls  the  example  of  proposing  marriage  by  sending  the  request  over  the  Jumbotron  at  a  major  sporting  event,  in  front  of  screaming  throngs  of  onlookers.   Despite  the  call  for  synthesis,  the  publication  of  synthetic  interpersonal  mass approaches to communication and new technology has not accelerated.  O’Sullivan’s  1999  analysis of articles in Human Communication Research since  its creation in 1974 to 1999 showed that less than 3% of articles offered “syn- thesis scholarship,” and the frequency of such synthesis did not increase after  the  Winter  1988  issue  calling  for  rapprochement  of  mass  and  interpersonal  communication research. Results of similar analyses for other major commu- nication journals such as Communication Monographs, the Journal of Communica- tion, and Communication Research over the same time period showed that a small  and sporadic amount of synthesis research has continued after several endorse- ments  O’Sullivan, 1999 . Much has changed since 1999 with respect to the  prevalence of the very technologies that may require synthetic approaches, and  the  number  of  articles  in  our  journals   and  journals  themselves   devoted  to  those technologies has changed as well.   Integrating mass and interpersonal dynamics may be easier said than done.  Adherents of each tradition who focus on new technology sometimes fail to  realize  their  sub- disciplinary  biases.  For  instance,  interactivity,  which  is  fre- quently mentioned in association with new technology, may connote different  things  for  different  analysts:  New  media  are  relatively  more  interactive  than  traditional  sources,  to  mass  communication  researchers;  new  media  are  less  interactive than traditional sources, to interpersonal communication research- ers  Walther, Gay, & Hancock, 2005 . Others caution that analysis of emer- gent forms of Internet communication defy a simplistic merger of traditional  mass  and  interpersonal  perspectives  altogether.  Caplan   2001 ,  for  instance,  argues that CMC involves mixtures of traditional features of mass and inter- personal communication in unique and recombinant ways: In CMC, senders  can be sources of mass communication  e.g., personal Web pages, participat- ing in a large online forum  and an interpersonal communication partner  e.g.,    22    Context  Instant Messaging, online chatting  at the same time. Receivers in CMC can be  anonymous audience members  lurkers , and can also be the targets of instant  personalized messages. Additionally, in CMC, message processes are not con- strained by time or physical space. Caplan argued that these fundamental dif- ferences between CMC and traditional mass or interpersonal communication  systems  cannot  be  understood  by  simply  “merging”  or  “bridging”  mass  and  interpersonal perspectives; they are fundamentally new processes that require  a new paradigmatic approach.   Although most predate the study of contemporary electronic communica- tion technologies, some efforts to bring specific mass and interpersonal pro- cesses  together  have  appeared  throughout  the  years.  These  integrations  provide  stimulating  launching  points  for  reconsideration  of  communication  processes in light of recent changes in the media and interpersonal landscapes.  The following discussion reviews some exemplars, and suggests extensions of  their potential application with respect to new media.  Functional Perspective on Information- Seeking  In his essay, “Mass Media and Interpersonal Channels: Competitive, Conver- gent, or Complementary?,” Chaffee  1986  discussed the convergent  overlap- ping   and  complementary   differentiated   roles  that  traditional  mass  and  interpersonal channels play in the acquisition and dissemination of communi- cation messages. Chaffee’s essay reminds readers that information sources are  less likely to be selected on the basis of whether they are mass or interpersonal  channels;  other  criteria  are  more  important  selection  determinants.  For  instance, an interpersonal source may have more or less credibility on a particu- lar topic than a mass media source. Alternatively, mass media sources may not  provide the same degree of access to information on a particular topic as might  be  available  by  asking  an  interpersonal  acquaintance.  No  single  information  source is the end of the process: An individual may seek information on a topic  from one target, and seek elaboration or a second opinion from another target.  Chaffee concluded that “The traditional concept of a directional ‘two step’ or  ‘multi  step’  flow  fails  to  capture  the  cyclical  and  reciprocal  nature  of  this  process”  1986, p. 76 .   Chaffee’s   1986   conceptualization  of  access  and  credibility  issues,  as  stronger determinants of information- seeking than media versus interpersonal  forms,  have  important  implications  in  the  contemporary  technological  landscape.   The  access  criterion  that  Chaffee   1986   identified  has  been  transformed  radically, in several ways, with dramatic implications. Chaffee asserted that we  seek information from media or interpersonal channels largely based on topic,    Interpersonal, Peer, and Media Influence Sources    23  timing,  and  immediate  accessibility.  In  Chaffee’s  time,  access  considerations  may have led an individual to choose an interpersonal or media source depend- ing on which source was more able to deliver information on a specific topic  most readily. If it was unlikely that TV news or a newspaper would soon carry  information on a topic of interest, one might seek a knowledgeable friend. In  the age of the Internet, however, a wide array of information is accessible on  demand. Because of the availability of the Internet, traditional mass media or  interpersonal  sources  may  be  less  likely  to  be  easy- access  starting  points  for  information- seeking. The search engine puts a virtual encyclopedia on every  desk.   Furthermore,  this  radical  degree  of  access  seems  to  have  obviated  tradi- tional credibility concerns in terms of preferences and acceptability of sources.  Chaffee  1986  argued that credibility—the expertise and trustworthiness of a  source—rather than the channel, plays the greatest role in our acceptance of  information. This may no longer be the case, at least in some contexts. Search  engine  users  generally  exhibit  the  tendency  to  “satisfice”  when  seeking  information online, relying on Google’s hierarchical display of search results  by relevance, regardless of the source of the pages referenced, in guiding their  information  acquisition   Pan  et  al.,  2007 .  In  a  study  of  health  and  medical  information- seeking,  Eysenbach  and  Köhler   2002   asked  focus  groups  of  Internet users how they selected credible sources of health information online.  Respondents offered reasonable criteria, such as the institutional source of the  information,  author  credentials,  and  recency  of  updating.  When  the  same  respondents were led to a computer lab and asked to find answers to specific  health- related questions, however, they relied almost exclusively on the top-  to-bottom rankings of search engine results, with no particular evaluation of  source credibility using the criteria they themselves had articulated moments  before  see also Metzger, Flanagin, & Zwarun, 2003; Walther, Wang, & Loh,  2004 .   As  we  suggested  above,  another  dramatic  shift  brought  on  by  electronic  technology’s  changes  in  information  access  pertains  not  only  to  the  conver- gence  of  media   television,  newspapers,  movies,  and  the  Internet ,  but  also  the more fundamental convergence of mass, interpersonal, and peer channels   mass media sources on the one hand, and synchronous or asynchronous dis- cussion with peers, family, and or friends on the other . In the contemporary  media landscape, individuals may consume traditional mass media information  from electronic mass media. For example, individuals may watch a Presiden- tial  candidate  debate  on  the  computer  via  CNN.com  or  even  on  YouTube  while they simultaneously or subsequently chat about that debate  and re- run  the good parts  online with peers or provocateurs. How does the presence of  peers  affect  perception  and  interpretation  of  the  political  messages?  In  the    24    Context  above scenario, do the chatroom messages complement the information being  provided by the political candidate or vice versa? Does the simultaneous con- vergence of information from two sources have the same degree of influence  as the traditional type of flow, in which information from one source precedes  information from the other source in a distinct temporal order? The Internet  and CMC subvert previous patterns with regard to the sequence of communi- cation flows among sources.   Research has provided some insights into the possible effects of online dis- cussions about both political races and public service announcements  PSAs .  Price  and  Cappella   2002   found  that  online  political  discussion  promoted  civic  engagement;  60  groups  of  citizens  engaged  monthly  in  real- time  CMC  discussions about issues facing the country and the ongoing 2000 presidential  campaign. Price and Cappella found that discussion participants recalled more  pro and con arguments over issues than they had held before the discussions.  This change correlated with increases in participants’ political knowledge. As a  result of participants’ online discussions, attitudes and behaviors were altered:  Those who had engaged in online political discussion were more likely to vote  and perform civic duties than individuals who did not participate in the discus- sions. Whether these effects are due in any way to CMC rather than discussion  per se was not addressed.   Chatroom discussions also facilitate ironic effects on the persuasive poten- tial of PSAs. David, Cappella, and Fishbein  2006  explored how adolescents’  online discussions that followed the viewing of weak or strong anti- marijuana  PSAs  affected  their  attitudes.  Results  showed  that  online  group  interaction  after weak PSA exposure led to more pro- marijuana attitudes and beliefs than  those in the no- chat conditions. A sample of seventh- and twelfth- grade stu- dents were assigned to four treatments crossing strong versus weak PSAs with  chat versus no- chat conditions, in groups of 10–20 at a time, with participants  using  pseudonymous  nicknames  when  they  discussed  the  PSAs.  David  et  al.  proposed that high sensation seekers were likely to process the PSA messages  in a biased manner. These individuals dominated the online discussions, eclips- ing others who might have favored the PSAs’ messages but who remained rela- tively  silent.  As  a  result,  the  outspoken  participants  influenced  others  negatively  with  respect  to  the  PSAs’  intended  effect  on  marijuana  attitudes.  Both  of  these  studies  demonstrate  potent  effects  of  online  chat,  but  did  not  examine  whether  online  discussions  offer  dynamics  which  differ  from  those  potentially garnered from face- to-face discussions.   Other research on social discussion of PSAs has reached alternative conclu- sions,  but  these  studies  employed  face- to-face  discussion  rather  than  online  chat.  Kelly  and  Edwards   1992   assigned  female  college  students  to  several  groups, some who observed anti- drug PSAs without discussion and others who    Interpersonal, Peer, and Media Influence Sources    25  observed the PSAs and engaged in discussion afterwards. Results were mixed  overall,  but  the  discussion  of  PSAs  had  a  significant  positive  effect  on  some  attitudinal outcomes. Warren et al.  2006  also compared the utility of class- room videos on adolescents’ substance- use rates, alone or accompanying face-  to-face  discussions.  Only  with  discussion  were  videos  effective  in  reducing  drug  use  in  that  sample.  Comparing  these  results  to  those  of  David  et  al.   2006 ,  there  appear  to  be  differences  in  the  effects  of  online  versus  offline  discussion of anti- drug PSAs.   Although David et al.  2006  did not consider online chats to provide any- thing other than a methodological convenience for the capture of adolescents’  discussions,  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  CMC  exerted  some  effect.  The  research on social influence in online settings under the aegis of the social iden- tification  and  deindividuation   SIDE   model  of  CMC   Reicher,  Spears,  &  Postmes, 1995  sheds some light on the issue. Several studies offer compelling  evidence that short- term anonymous online chats bestow extraordinary pres- sure  on  participants  to  conform  to  normative  positions  in  group  discussions   Sassenberg & Boos, 2003; see, for review, Postmes, Spears, & Lea, 1999 ,  and  that  these  dynamics  are  diluted  in  face- to-face  settings.  Thus,  effects  of  CMC in the discussion of PSAs or other media messages should be expected to  differ from offline discussions. David et al.  2006  did note that the older and  more influential teens were generally considered to have higher social status  than younger ones and more likely to have had prior experience with mari- juana.  It  is  just  such  social  identification  dynamics  that  should  lead  to  more  pronounced effects in CMC than face- to-face interaction. Social identification  and peer group influence in CMC should be a useful element in explaining a  variety of influence effects in the new technological landscape, as we will illus- trate further below.  Multiple Information Sources and Peer Influence:   Web 2.0  Do asynchronous comments about videos affect perceptions of videos the same  way that chatroom discussions undermined the potential influence of anti- drug  PSAs? Do comments appearing adjacent to YouTube videos affect perception  of  the  videos?  There  is  a  need  for  further  research  on  how  social  influence  transpires  under  various  conditions  where  online  peer  discussion  co- appear  with institutionally authored messages or other messages that bear the conven- tional characteristics of mass media. These situations are made radically acces- sible  by  the  convergence  of  mass,  peer,  and  interpersonal  communication  channels.  Online  chatrooms,  asynchronous  discussion  boards,  and  various  types  of  commenting  and  referral  systems  provide  salient  group  dynamics.    26    Context  Indeed, we wish to suggest that one of the most fruitful approaches to under- standing  new  technology  may  be  through  consideration  of  the  multiple  and  simultaneous social influence agents embodied in the channels that these tech- nologies make salient.   Much attention has been given to Web 2.0  O’Reilly, 2005 , which encap- sulates  websites  built  to  facilitate  interactivity  and  co- creation  of  content  by  website visitors in addition to original authors. In the original Web, personal  and institutional Web pages were changeable but not dynamic  Papacharissi,  2002 . Feedback to a website’s content was made through other channels— primarily email—if at all. The traditional Web was a one- to-many medium,  and in that respect was similar to other mass communication channels  Tren- holm,  1999 .  More  recent  technologies  allow  for  interactivity  on  websites.  For example, Facebook, a social networking site, allows users to place com- ments on their friends’ “walls,” thereby co- creating their friends’ homepages   Levy, 2007 .   Web  2.0  provides  new  forms  of  communication  among  individuals  and  groups. In addition to social network sites on which one’s associates can con- tribute content to one’s Web- based profile, it includes picture- sharing systems  that  allow  users  to  append  “tags”  to  content  that  facilitate  later  searching,  linking, and the discovery of conceptually or visually similar content on others’  sites;  video- sharing  systems  like  YouTube,  where  users  upload  and  share  videos, and may publically comment on those videos either verbally or with  additional videos; wikis, which are collaboratively edited documents; reputa- tion systems such as those on product vendor sites, on which customers can  post their evaluations of products and vendors, or on auction sites such as eBay  where sellers and buyers are numerically and verbally rated for others to see,  as well as sites that specifically solicit ratings of instructors such as RateMyPro- fessor.com. All of these forms allow ostensible peers—other users—to inter- act,  without  having  to  disclose  much  about  one’s  offline  identity  or  qualifications. The sites are populated by relatively anonymous peers. As such,  they  are  prone  to  the  kinds  of  influence  that  social  identification  facilitates.  Moreover, we may say that the peers are not simply peers, but peers exhibit- ing  “optimal  heterophily”   Rogers  &  Shoemaker,  1971 :  They  are  like  us  in  terms of interests and in their shared perspective  e.g., also customers rather  than vendors, students rather than teachers  except for one important differ- ence: They have experience with the specific target  vendor, professor, etc.   while we do not. Thus their trustworthiness and relative expertise should be  quite strong. Indeed, Sundar and Nass  2001  found that people more highly  value information presented on computers when they believe that the informa- tion  was  selected  by  other   unidentified   computer  users.  In  an  experiment  that  presented  identical  news  stories  on  computers  to  subjects,  ostensibly    Interpersonal, Peer, and Media Influence Sources    27  peer- selected  stories  were  preferred,  as  opposed  to  stories  that  appeared  to  have  been  chosen  by  news  editors,  computer  algorithms,  or  even  by  the  subject him- or herself. When other users were perceived to be the source of  online news, the stories were liked more and perceived to be higher in quality,  and were perceived to be more representative of news.   Casting Web 2.0 as an interface that presents multiple sources of influence  demands that we explore whether and how peers’  users’  additions to Web  pages  affect  other  users’  perceptions  of  the  original  author’s  mass  media  message. Several studies have begun in this direction.   These  effects  are  clear  in  online  recommender  systems,  or  reputation  systems:  Tools  explicitly  designed  to  display  peers’  evaluations  of  various  targets. Their foci range from product reviews and vendor reviews to profes- sor reviews. The impact of peers’ online comments also arise when viewing  users’  reactions  to  online  news  stories,  and  even  to  comments  about  indi- viduals  as  they  appear  in  people’s  Facebook  profiles.  In  terms  of  vender  reviews,  Resnick,  Zeckhauser,  Friedman,  and  Kuwabara   2000   established  that the quality of one’s ratings as a seller on eBay—ostensibly generated by a  prospective buyer’s peers—renders a demonstrable monetary influence on the  prices one is able to garner for the goods one sells. Edwards, Edwards, Quing,  and Wahl  2007  experimentally examined the impact of online peer reviews  of college faculty in RateMyProfessor.com on students’ perceptions of faculty.  Edwards  et  al.  proposed  that  online  reviews  are  believed  to  be  authored  by  individuals  similar  to  the  receiver.  After  reviewing  contrived  positive  peer  reviews  for  a  professor  on  RateMyProfessor.com,  and  watching  a  video  showing a sample of the professor’s lecture, students rated the instructor more  attractive and credible. On the other hand, when students read negative peer  evaluations,  they  rated  the  instructor  as  less  attractive  and  less  credible,  despite watching the identical lecture video. This research found similar results  with respect to attitudes toward course material and learning. Edwards et al.  concluded that the interactive Web has the ability to manipulate offline beliefs  and actions, by affecting students’ perceptions of credibility and attractiveness,  their affective learning, and state motivation in the educational process.   Reliance on online user- generated recommendation systems has become a  normal strategy by which prospective shoppers, healthcare users, and hobby- ists evaluate the credibility of online sellers or service providers, according to  research by Metzger, Flanagin, and Medders  in press . A series of focus group  discussions uniformly indicated that Internet users frequently rely on  tools  such  as  feedback  systems,  testimonials,  and  reputation  systems  as  ways  to  help  them  make  credibility  evaluations.  Many  participants  indi- cated that they looked at the number of testimonials or reviews available    28    Context  online, paid attention to the proportion of negative to positive reviews, or  relied more heavily on negative versus positive reviews.    The influence of Web- based social comments on perceptions of individuals  extends beyond the inspection of recommender systems, and even beyond the  deliberate consideration of others’ comments. Peers’ online comments can also  influence readers’ attitudes and perceptions about the news. In Lee, Jang, and  Kim’s  2009  experiment, undergraduates viewed online news stories address- ing  teacher  compensation  packages.  Alongside  the  stories,  peers’  comments  appeared either to agree or disagree with the actions that the news story pre- sented. Those who read comments opposing the issues rated the story more  negatively. In addition to affecting their own attitudes regarding the news, the  online comments also affected readers’ perceptions of public sentiment about  the  teacher  compensation  issue:  Participants  who  read  other  ostensible  readers’ comments perceived that public sentiment about teacher compensa- tion packages was more congruent with the direction of attitudes appearing in  the posted comments. Taken together, these results indicate that third- party  online  commentary  not  only  influences  individuals’  attitudes  regarding  the  specific target of others’ comments, but it also influences individuals’ percep- tions on the attitudes of the general online community.   The  effect  of  third- party  comments,  and  other  attributes  of  third- party  agents, also extends to perceptions of individuals who created online profiles  in social network systems. Walther, Van Der Heide, Kim, Westerman, and  Tong   2008   found  that  the  content  of  friends’  postings  on  profile  owners’  “walls”  in  the  Facebook  social  network  site  affects  perceptions  of  profile  owners’  credibility  and  attractiveness.  The  physical  appearance  of  one’s  friends, as shown in those wall postings, affects the perceived physical appear- ance of the profile owner, as well. Additional research shows that when there  is a discrepancy between a Facebook profile owner’s self- disclosed extraver- sion and perceived attractiveness, and the imputation of those characteristics  implied  by  wall  postings,  others’  comments  override  the  profile  owners’  claims  Walther, Van Der Heide, Hamel, & Shulman, 2009 .   While new communication technology can make peers and their potential  influence exceptionally salient, the basis of online influence dynamics need not  rest in group identification and social identities, as the SIDE model claims. In  some  circumstances  new  communication  technologies  make  individuals  salient, raising the potential influence of interpersonal sources as well. Several  social network systems within Web 2.0 applications make salient what one’s  friends are doing, not just what a diffuse group of anonymous peers have to  say. For instance, although it is clear that the definition of “friend” is stretched  rather  thin  in  Facebook,  where  the  250–275  average  number  of  friends  an    Interpersonal, Peer, and Media Influence Sources    29  individual  specifies  and  links  with   Vanden  Boogart,  2006;  Walther  et  al.,  2008  exceeds by far the 10–20 close relationships people tend to sustain in  traditional relationships  Parks, 2007 , among this huge amalgamation may be  one’s  closest  affiliates.  Facebook  prompts  users  to  describe,  and  the  system  displays, what films and TV shows these friends are watching, what political  views  they  hold,  and  what  events  they  are  attending.  Even  the  Web- based  DVD- by-mail system, Netflix, offers users the opportunity to share informa- tion automatically about what movies chosen friends have rented and how they  rated them.   To  summarize,  one  important  avenue  of  research  for  the  convergence  of  sources  that  new  technology  promotes  will  be  to  understand  the  various  avenues  and  interactions  of  social  influence  agents  who  co- appear   or  are  closely  within  clicking  reach   in  Web  2.0  interfaces.  Another  potentially  important line of research goes beyond the impact of the overwhelming pres- ence  of  what  friends  and  peers  think  and  do  in  terms  of  social  influence  on  receivers. The dynamics we have considered so far have focused on how indi- viduals  passively  use  the  social  information  made  manifest  by  participative  social technologies, in terms of how such information shapes receivers’ own  perceptions and decisions.   If  individuals  come  to  guide  their  own  media  information- seeking  and  information- processing in order to attempt to satisfy other social goals through  subsequent or simultaneous interactions with social partners, convergent social  technologies make possible a separate set of dynamics. For example, do friends  and  family  members  watch  broadcasted  political  debates  for  the  express  purpose of gathering talking points with which to deride certain parties’ can- didates in interpersonal conversations with relational partners? If so, do these  motivations affect attention to and processing of candidates’ messages? Other  research on traditional communication sets the stage for a contemporary re-  examination of just such possibilities.  “Communicatory Utility” in Media Information-  Seeking  The predominant view of the two- step flow of individuals’ use of mass media  and interpersonal encounters suggests that individuals garner information from  the media that they then elaborate in interpersonal encounters, to understand  the issues that the media discuss. In distinction to the primacy of the issue sug- gested  in  such  an  approach,  Atkin   1972   demonstrated  how  interpersonal  motivations drive mass media information- seeking in order to fulfill interper- sonal  goals.  Atkin   1973   defined  behavioral  adaptation  as  one  of  the  primary  motivations  to  seek  information:  Because  of  an  individual’s  “need  [of]    30    Context  information  that  is  useful  for  directing  anticipated  behavior”   p.  217 ,  people  garner information from mass media when they anticipated future communica- tion with others about some topic. As such, while information garnered from  mass media sources may provide its consumers with matter related to the topic,  it also provides communicatory utility—awareness about a topic about which the  individual expects to interact—with respect to further conversations.   In  establishing  these  constructs,  Atkin   1972   analyzed  survey  data  that  revealed an association between the number of conversations people had with  others  about  the  news  and  the  number  of  news  sources  to  which  one  was  exposed.  Atkin  also  found  a  significant  association  between  the  degree  to  which  individuals  discussed  an  ongoing  presidential  campaign  with  their  family and friends and the degree to which they sought information about that  campaign, even after controlling for individuals’ level of interest in the cam- paign  as well as education level and socioeconomic status of participants . In  other words, even when people were not interested in the presidential cam- paign, they sought information about the campaign because they knew they  would be called upon to have interpersonal discussions about it. To further  establish the effect, Atkin  1972  conducted an original experiment in which  he  led  subjects  to  different  levels  of  expected  future  interaction  on  various  news topics of a local or national relevance. Expected future communication  about a topic significantly predicted the extent to which participants reported  information- seeking on that particular topic. Similar findings are reported by  Wenner  1976 , who found that some people who watched television did so  because it provided a vehicle for conversation, and Lull  1980 , who found  that media were often used relationally to facilitate interpersonal communi- cation. Similar effects have been found in more recent studies as well  e.g.,  Southwell  &  Torres,  2006 .  In  short,  one  drive  to  employ  mass  media  information is because of prospective discussion about it among interpersonal  acquaintances.   Atkin’s   1972   notion  of  communicatory  utility  is  intriguing  on  several  counts. Clearly it offers another insight into the merger of mass and interper- sonal events, but it connects the utilization of mass communication to a super- ordinate interpersonal functionality. It is intriguing in terms of the questions it  raises with respect to the availability of mass and interpersonal sources in the  current technological landscape: Do individuals peruse electronic mass media,  as well as websites or recommendation systems online, in order to fuel discus- sions with friends? Do these discussions precede or co- occur with the perusal  of information sources, rather than follow them the next day at lunch? That is,  does a question  or an anticipated question  in an online chat with a friend or  friends  prompt  an  information  search  in  situ?  All  of  these  variations  are  germane  to  the  notion  of  communicatory  utility  online,  and  they  raise    Interpersonal, Peer, and Media Influence Sources    31  information- processing  questions  that  pertain  to  the  timing  and  specifiability  of information sought when interpersonal discussion and media searching can  take place contemporaneously.   Communicatory utility is a concept that helps to explain an example offered  above:  Individuals  might  watch  a  political  debate  not  in  order  to  gather  information with which to make a voting decision, but rather, to have ammu- nition with which to derogate some candidates. Yet Atkin’s original formula- tion of the utility construct offered little in the way of information about what  kinds of interpersonal goals might be served by sampling media, other than to  be able to hold one’s own conversationally. By expanding the range of inter- personal goals one may consider, the potential of communicatory utility can  go  beyond  helping  us  to  understand  media  consumption,  to  help  illuminate  issues of media information processing.   We posit that the specific interpersonal goal s  that prompt an individual’s  media consumption shape attention to variations in the content and features of  the topical information one consumes, affecting its interpretation and recall.  For instance, collectively derogating political candidates or office- holders may  be  an  activity  that  relational  partners  use  to  reinforce  the  similarity  of  their  attitudes. This, of course, is not restricted to online news and online chats, but  may be a general purpose, cross- media communication function. As such, one  may  not  watch  a  debate  or  speech  with  an  open  mind  in  an  effort  to  make  political decisions. Rather, one may watch for the illogical assertions and dumb  mistakes a disliked speaker utters.   These  notions  raise  the  question  of  whether  purposive  sampling  of  mass  media information is biased by specific interpersonal goals. If so, how? How  does  biased  sampling  affect  attention,  repetition,  inference,  and  retention?  Goals  may  vary  in  any  number  of  dimensions  with  respect  to  instrumental,  identity,  or  relational  issues   Clark  &  Delia,  1979;  Graham,  Argyle,  &  Furnham, 1980  in the service of needs for inclusion, affection, and or control   Schutz, 1966 . The goals of an online chat may include the desire to impress a  conversational partner. This could take the form of a desire to maintain status,  as  may  have  been  the  case  in  the  adolescent  chats  observed  by  David  et  al.   2006 ,  consistent  with  Heider’s   1958   balance  theory.  Do  adolescent  stu- dents who crave inclusion with outspoken sensation- seekers look for anti- drug  YouTube videos accompanied by derisive user comments, to which they add  their own derision? Alternatively, interpersonal goals may reflect a desire to  express attitudinal agreement and convey interpersonal similarity in order to  impress a prospective relationship partner. If the expression of one’s attitude  becomes a strategy subordinated to a goal of expressing solidarity with another  person, one’s sampling of media messages is likely to be exercised in a manner  which  allows  one  to  express  the  socially  utilitarian  attitude.  Thus  when    32    Context  individuals pursue relational goals, they may focus their media sampling and  the  potentially  counter- attitudinal  advocacy  they  generate.  In  this  way  rela- tional  goals  affect  the  attention,  selection,  interpretation,  and  retention  of  media information.   The currency of this proposition is that information- seeking and process- ing may be different in traditional environments, where media exposure and  interpersonal discussion are separated by some interval of time, compared to  the new media environment in which mass and interpersonal channels may be  sampled  and re- sampled  simultaneously. Even in offline group discussions,  communicators share or withhold information in a biased manner due to the  social motives they bring to discussions, such as maintaining good relations,  obviating  conflict,  or  gaining  status;  validation  from  others  further  biases  information sharing  Wittenbaum, Hollingshead, & Botero, 2004 . Computer-  mediated  communication  may  exacerbate  this  tendency.  CMC  has  particu- larly  dynamic  properties  that  facilitate  selective  self- presentation  in  the  pursuit of relational goals, facilitated by unique characteristics of the channel  and the context in which it is deployed  Walther, 1996 . Studies show that  CMC allows users fluidly to adapt their self- presentation to their expectations  or observations of a conversational partner in order to facilitate impressions  and positive interactions, in both asynchronous statements  e.g., Thompson,  Murachver, & Green, 2001; Walther, 2007  and adaptive synchronous inter- actions  e.g., Herring & Martinson, 2004 . Web users are well aware of the  impressions they construct in the pursuit of relationships, and consider care- fully  the  balance  between  honest  disclosure  versus  socially  desirable  distor- tion  in  selecting  communication  strategies  to  attract  others  online   Gibbs,  Ellison, & Heino, 2006 . For these reasons, it is important to improve under- standing  of  how  these  Internet- magnified  motivations  affect  message  processing.  New Message Forms  Finally, an approach to new communication technology from the perspective  of  mass,  peer,  and  interpersonal  communication  and  communicators’  goals  may  offer  approaches  to  new  communication  forms,  the  understanding  of  which begs real analysis. Although there may be many aspects of CMC that are  analytically novel in structure and purpose  see Caplan, 2001 , we focus here  on  a  potential  hybrid  of  mass  and  interpersonal  messaging:  Public  interper- sonal messages posted on social network sites. Although these sites have been  the focus on intense research activity of late, very little research has formally  considered the goals guiding users as they compose messages. Ultimately, we  believe,  a  goals- based  approach  will  help  us  to  understand  how  the  users  of    Interpersonal, Peer, and Media Influence Sources    33  such  systems  conceive  of  these  publicly  shared  messages,  which,  given  that  communication technologies are often best understood in terms of their actual  appropriations   see  DeSanctis  &  Poole,  1994 ,  will  allow  us  to  learn  much  about their utility as communication tools and the messages they convey.   An example becoming very well- known is the Facebook feature, wall post- ings. Person A, who Person B has specified in the system as a “friend”  a person  with privileges to see and contribute to portions of Person B’s profile  can post  an  interpersonal  verbal  message   accompanied  by  Person  A’s  photo,  by  default   to  Person  B’s  profile  wall.  These  postings  often  appear  to  express  interpersonal affection, comment on some mutual event in the past or future,  or proclaim relational status  among best friends forever! . However, it is also  known to all involved—posters and profile- owners—that such messages can  also be read by all the other people connected to Person B’s social network of  friends. It is, by definition, a public message, bordering on being broadcasted   or at least, narrowcasted within the social network  for others to see. Face- book users have noted that one of the main uses for social networking techno- logy is relational maintenance  Lampe, Ellison, & Steinfield, 2006 . Are such  wall posts “mass” messages or “interpersonal” messages?   The exchange of messages that are inherently interpersonal and at the same  time public is rare, and comparable to few other communication forms. The  notion of posting on a “wall” may conjure the image of graffiti, which share  communication  characteristics  with  Facebook.  Rodriguez  and  Clair   1999   note that graffiti are participatory exchanges: An individual writes a message  which others independently observe and to which they potentially reply. Graf- fiti also share characteristics of mass media messages: Messages are transmitted  by  a  sender  to  many  receivers,  mediated  by  the  wall  on  which  they  are  written.  Graffiti  rely  on  asynchronous  interactivity   Robshaw,  1996 ,  like  Facebook, although the lack of photos and other individual authors’ signifiers  obviously limits graffiti’s social networking and relational maintenance utility.   In one sense wall postings may constitute “tie signs”  Morris, 1977 . In their  material manifestations offline, where they are less content- rich than Facebook  messages, tie signs function as public symbols of interpersonal connections, or  “signals that a couple is to be treated as a bonded pair”  Burgoon, Buller, &  Woodall, 1989, p. 318 , and can include touch behaviors or articles of cloth- ing,  jewelry,  decorations,  or  other  adornments  that  belong  to,  or  signal  mutual  belonging  to,  another  person.  A  woman  wearing  a  particular  man’s  sweater, or a half- heart pendant, can constitute such public signifiers of rela- tional belonging. They do not always explicate who the relational partner is,  the way a Facebook posting makes obvious and visual. Yet Facebook postings  do contain content, and the construction of that public private content may  be intriguing.   34    Context    Facebook  posts  certainly  qualify  as  that  which  O’Sullivan   2005   called  “masspersonal  communications,”  yet  this  characterization  only  helps  to  raise  rather than answer questions about their function and strategic aspects. How  does their knowledge about the public visibility of their otherwise private con- versation  affect  friends’  construction  of  Facebook  wall  posts?  Is  there  con- scious  or  unconscious  collusion  in  the  collaborative  construction  of  personal  identity online—are there “rules” of Facebook postings  e.g., if I do not post  pictures of myself drinking, my friends don’t discuss it  that define friendship  online, or that distinguish between close versus weak friendship constructions?  Do private codes appear on wall postings, and if so, to communicate meaning  to  the  friend  or  to  signal  exclusivity  to  others?  Do  supportive  wall  postings  buffer  offline  public  embarrassments,  even  if  there  is  no  ostensible  content-  based  connection  between  the  events?  What  communicatory  utility  does  a  Facebook posting provide for other conversations—or, what communicatory  utility  does  “real  life”  offer  for  self- promotion  and  relational  signification  on  Facebook? Unless one commands a flock of paparazzi, rarely before these par- ticipative  social  network  technologies  could  people  make  such  varied  public  displays of affection, among such different levels of relationships, in such an  enduring  and  broadcast  manner.  What  users  think  as  they  construct  these  masspersonal messages is a new domain of inquiry that reference to interper- sonal goals and audience considerations will help to address. Web 2.0 sites are  by nature interactive environments, not just site- to-user, but user- to-user and  user- to-public  as  well.  Consequently,  the  way  people  learn  to  interact  may  also be evolving. In  conclusion,  we  reiterate  a  new  perspective  on  the  merger  of  various    communication processes in the common interface that some new communi- cation  technologies  provide.  The  first  analytic  keystone  is  to  recognize  that  new interfaces bring into proximity or simultaneity information from several  types of sources. Analysis proceeds by identifying the presence and salience of  type of sources such as institutional, interpersonal, and or peer, and to assess  the sources of credibility relevant to each source in situ with respect to com- municators’ goals. A second analytic keystone is the recognition not only that  interpersonal  contacts  motivate  media  information- seeking,  but  that  an  expanded  range  of  particular  interpersonal  goals  may  be  found  to  affect  information processing in potentially different ways; different relational moti- vations such as status seeking, maintenance, or relationship initiation may bias  information  sampling  from  various  media  and  affect  the  ultimate  interpreta- tions derived from them. These dynamics may be especially potent when con- versations guide media consumption simultaneously, as the Internet not only  allows but promotes.

Chapter 2 Social Network Sites as  Networked Publics Affordances, Dynamics, and  Implications  danah boyd  Social  network  sites  have  gained  tremendous  traction  recently  as  popular  online  hangout  spaces  for  both  youth  and  adults.  People  flock  to  them  to  socialize with their friends and acquaintances, to share information with inter- ested others, and to see and be seen. While networking socially or for profes- sional purposes is not the predominant practice, there are those who use these  sites  to  flirt  with  friends- of-friends,  make  business  acquaintances,  and  occa- sionally even rally others for a political cause. I have been examining different  aspects  of  social  network  sites,  primarily  from  an  ethnographic  perspective,  for over six years. In making sense of the practices that unfold on and through  these sites, I have come to understand social network sites as a genre of “net- worked publics.”   Networked publics are publics that are restructured by networked technolo- gies. As such, they are simultaneously  1  the space constructed through net- worked technologies and  2  the imagined collective that emerges as a result  of  the  intersection  of  people,  technology,  and  practice.  Networked  publics  serve many of the same functions as other types of publics—they allow people  to gather for social, cultural, and civic purposes, and they help people connect  with a world beyond their close friends and family. While networked publics  share much in common with other types of publics, the ways in which techno- logy  structures  them  introduces  distinct  affordances  that  shape  how  people  engage  with  these  environments.  The  properties  of  bits—as  distinct  from  atoms—introduce new possibilities for interaction. As a result, new dynamics  emerge that shape participation.   Analytically,  the  value  of  constructing  social  network  sites  as  networked  publics  is  to  see  the  practices  that  unfold  there  as  being  informed  by  the  affordances  of  networked  publics  and  the  resultant  common  dynamics.  Net- worked publics’ affordances do not dictate participants’ behavior, but they do  configure  the  environment  in  a  way  that  shapes  participants’  engagement.  In  essence, the architecture of a particular environment matters and the architecture    40    Context  of networked publics is shaped by their affordances. The common dynamics  fall  out  from  these  affordances  and  showcase  salient  issues  that  participants  must  regularly  contend  with  when  engaging  in  these  environments.  Under- standing  the  properties,  affordances,  and  dynamics  common  to  networked  publics  provides  a  valuable  framework  for  working  out  the  logic  of  social  practices.   The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  map  out  the  architecture  of  networked  publics, beginning with the bits- based nature of digital environments and then  moving on to show how the affordances of networked publics are informed by  the  properties  of  bits  and  highlighting  common  dynamics  that  emerge  from  those affordances. Before examining these various properties, affordances, and  dynamics, I will begin with a discussion of what constitutes publics in order to  account  for  the  conceptualization  of  networked  publics.  In  introducing  the  notion of architecture, I will also map out some of the critical features of social  network sites as a type of networked public.  Publics and Networked Publics  Networked publics must be understood in terms of “publics,” a contested and  messy term with multiple meanings that is used across different disciplines to  signal different concepts. One approach is to construct “public” as a collection  of people who share “a common understanding of the world, a shared identity,  a claim to inclusiveness, a consensus regarding the collective interest”  Living- stone,  2005,  p.  9 .  In  this  sense,  a  public  may  refer  to  a  local  collection  of  people   e.g.,  one’s  peers   or  a  much  broader  collection  of  people   e.g.,  members of a nation- state . Those invested in the civic functioning of publics  often  concern  themselves  with  the  potential  accessibility  of  spaces  and  information  to  wide  audiences—“the  public”—and  the  creation  of  a  shared  “public sphere”  Habermas, 1991 . Yet, as Benedict Anderson  2006  argues,  the notion of a public is in many ways an “imagined community.” Some schol- ars  contend  that  there  is  no  single  public,  but  many  publics  to  which  some  people are included and others excluded  Warner, 2002 .   Cultural  and  media  studies  offer  a  different  perspective  on  the  notion  of  what  constitutes  a  public.  In  locating  the  term  “public”  as  synonymous  with  “audience,”  Sonia  Livingstone   2005   uses  the  term  to  refer  to  a  group  bounded by a shared text, whether a worldview or a performance. The audi- ence produced by media is often by its very nature a public, but not neces- sarily  a  passive  one.  For  example,  Michel  de  Certeau   2002   argues  that  consumption and production of cultural objects are intimately connected, and  Henry Jenkins  2006  applies these ideas to the creation and dissemination of  media. Mizuko Ito extends this line of thinking to argue that “publics can be    Social Network Sites as Networked Publics    41  reactors,   re makers  and   re distributors,  engaging  in  shared  culture  and  knowledge  through  discourse  and  social  exchange  as  well  as  through  acts  of  media reception”  Ito, 2008, p. 3 .   It is precisely this use of public that upsets political theorists like Jurgen Haber- mas, who challenge the legitimacy of any depoliticized public preoccupied “with  consumption of culture”  Habermas, 1991, p. 177 . Of course, not all political  scholars  agree  with  Habermas’  objection  to  the  cultural  significance  of  publics.  Feminist scholar Nancy Fraser argues that publics are not only a site of discourse  and  opinion  but  “arenas  for  the  formation  and  enactment  of  social  identities”   Fraser, 1992 , while Craig Calhoun argues that one of Habermas’ weaknesses is  his naive view that “identities and interests [are] settled within the private world  and then brought fully formed into the public sphere”  Calhoun, 1992, p. 35 .   Networked publics exist against this backdrop. Mizuko Ito introduces the  notion of networked publics to “reference a linked set of social, cultural, and  technological  developments  that  have  accompanied  the  growing  engagement  with  digitally  networked  media”   Ito,  2008,  p.  2 .  Ito  emphasizes  the  net- worked  media,  but  I  believe  we  must  also  focus  on  the  ways  in  which  this  shapes publics—both in terms of space and collectives. In short, I contend that  networked publics are publics that are restructured by networked technolo- gies; they are simultaneously a space and a collection of people. In  bringing  forth  the  notion  of  networked  publics,  I  am  not  seeking  to    resolve  the  different  discursive  threads  around  the  notion  of  publics.  My  approach accepts the messiness and, instead, focuses on the ways in which net- worked technologies extend and complicate publics in all of their forms. What  distinguishes networked publics from other types of publics is their underlying  structure. Networked technologies reorganize how information flows and how  people interact with information and each other. In essence, the architecture of  networked publics differentiates them from more traditional notions of publics.  How the Properties of Bits and Atoms Shape  Architecture  While Frank Lloyd Wright defined architecture as “life”  Wright & Gutheim,  1941, p. 257 , there is no broadly accepted definition  Shepheard, 1994 . Yet,  in the everyday sense, architecture typically evokes the image of the design of  physical  structures—buildings,  roads,  gardens,  and  even  interstitial  spaces.  The product of architecture can be seen as part engineering, part art, and part  socially configuring, as structures are often designed to be variably functional,  aesthetically pleasing, and influential in shaping how people interact with one  another. The word “architecture” is also used in technical circles to refer to  the organization of code that produces digital environments. Drawing on all of    42    Context  these uses, architecture can also serve as an important conceptual lens through  which to understand structural differences in technologies in relation to prac- tice  Papacharissi, 2009 .   Physical  structures  are  a  collection  of  atoms,  while  digital  structures  are  built out of bits. The underlying properties of bits and atoms fundamentally  distinguish these two types of environments, define what types of interactions  are  possible,  and  shape  how  people  engage  in  these  spaces.  Both  William  Mitchell  1995, p. 111  and Lawrence Lessig  2006, pp. 1–8  have argued that  “code is law” because code regulates the structures that emerge. James Grim- melmann argues that Lessig’s use of this phrase is “shorthand for the subtler  idea  that  code  does  the  work  of  law,  but  does  it  in  an  architectural  way”   Grimmelmann,  2004,  p.  1721 .  In  looking  at  how  code  configures  digital  environments,  both  Mitchell  and  Lessig  highlight  the  ways  in  which  digital  architectures are structural forces.   The  difference  between  bits  and  atoms  as  architectural  building  blocks  is  central to the ways in which networked publics are constructed differently than  other publics. More than a decade ago, Nicholas Negroponte  1995  mapped out  some core differences between bits and atoms to argue that digitization would  fundamentally alter the landscape of information and media. He pointed out that  bits  could  be  easily  duplicated,  compressed,  and  transmitted  through  wires;  media that is built out of bits could be more easily and more quickly dissemi- nated  than  that  which  comprises  atoms.  During  that  same  period,  Mitchell   1995  argued that bits do not simply change the flow of information, but they  alter  the  very  architecture  of  everyday  life.  Through  networked  technology,  people  are  no  longer  shaped  just  by  their  dwellings  but  by  their  networks   Mitchell, 1995, p. 49 . The city of bits that Mitchell lays out is not configured  just by the properties of bits but by the connections between them.   The  affordances  of  networked  publics  are  fundamentally  shaped  by  the  properties of bits, the connections between bits, and the way that bits and net- works link people in new ways. Networked publics are not just publics net- worked  together,  but  they  are  publics  that  have  been  transformed  by  networked media, its properties, and its potential. The properties of bits regu- late the structure of networked publics, which, in turn, introduces new pos- sible practices and shapes the interactions that take place. These can be seen in  the architecture of all networked publics, including social network sites.  Features of Social Network Sites  Social  network  sites  are  similar  to  many  other  genres  of  social  media  and  online  communities  that  support  computer- mediated  communication,  but  what defines this particular category of website is the combination of features    Social Network Sites as Networked Publics    43  that allow individuals to  1  construct a public or semi- public profile within a  bounded  system,   2   articulate  a  list  of  other  users  with  whom  they  share  a  connection, and  3  view and traverse their list of connections and those made  by others within the system  boyd & Ellison, 2007 . Features and functionality  vary  across  different  social  network  sites,  providing  a  variety  of  different  public and private communication channels, but I want to focus on four types  of features that play a salient role in constructing social network sites as net- worked publics—profiles, Friends lists, public commenting tools, and stream-  based updates. These different features showcase how bits are integrated into  the architecture of networked publics.  Profiles  Profiles are not unique to social network sites, but they are central to them.  Profiles  both  represent  the  individual  and  serve  as  the  locus  of  interaction.  Because  of  the  inherent  social—and  often  public  or  semi- public—nature  of  profiles, participants actively and consciously craft their profiles to be seen by  others. Profile generation is an explicit act of writing oneself into being in a  digital environment  boyd, 2006 , and participants must determine how they  want to present themselves to those who may view their self- representation or  those who they wish might. Because of this, issues of fashion and style play a  central role in participants’ approach to their profiles.   In addition to being a site of self- representation, profiles are a place where  people gather to converse and share. Conversations happen on profiles and a  person’s profile reflects their engagement with the site. As a result, particip- ants  do  not  have  complete  control  over  their  self- representation.  Although  features  may  allow  participants  to  restrict  others’  contributions  to  their  profile, most participants welcome the contribution of images and comments.   Profiles are also a site of control, allowing participants to determine who  can see what and how. While social network site profiles can be accessible to  anyone—“truly public”—it is common for participants to limit the visibility of  their profiles, making them “semi- public.” Semi- public profiles are still typic- ally available to a broad audience, comprised of friends, acquaintances, peers,  and  interesting  peripheral  ties.  In  this  way,  profiles  are  where  the  potential  audience is fixed, creating a narrower public shaped by explicit connection or  affiliation.  Friends Lists  On social network sites, participants articulate who they wish to connect with,  and confirm ties to those who wish to connect with them. Most social network    44    Context  sites  require  connections  to  be  mutually  confirmed  before  being  displayed.  Each individual’s Friends list is visible to anyone who has permission to view  that person’s profile.   The public articulation of Friends on a social network site is not simply an  act of social accounting. These Friends are rarely only one’s closest and dearest  friends. The listing of Friends is both political and social. In choosing who to  include as Friends, participants more frequently consider the implications of  excluding or explicitly rejecting a person as opposed to the benefits of includ- ing  them.  While  there  are  participants  who  will  strictly  curtail  their  list  of  Friends and participants who gregariously seek to add anyone, the majority of  participants simply include all who they consider a part of their social world.  This  might  include  current  and  past  friends  and  acquaintances  as  well  as  peripheral ties, or people that the participant barely knows but feels compelled  to include. The most controversial actors are those who hold power over the  participant, such as parents, bosses, and teachers. For many participants, it is  more socially costly to include these individuals than it is to include less inti- mate ties.   One  way  of  interpreting  the  public  articulation  of  connections  on  social  networks  is  to  see  it  as  the  articulation  of  a  public.  These  Friends  are  the  people with whom the participants see themselves connecting en masse. For  some participants, it is important to make certain that these individuals are all  part of the same social context; for others, mixing different social contexts is  acceptable and desirable. How a participant approaches the issue of social con- texts shapes who they may or may not include as Friends. In  theory,  truly  public  profiles  can  be  accessed  by  anyone.  In  reality,  an    individual’s audience is typically much smaller than all people across all space  and  all  time.  Even  when  participants  choose  to  make  their  profiles  widely  accessible  or  seek  broad  audiences,  very  few  people  are  likely  to  look.  In  determining  who  to  account  for  as  viewers  when  interacting  in  networked  publics, few participants consider every possible person to be their audience.  Instead, they imagine an audience that is usually more constrained by who they  wish to reach and how they wish to present themselves  Marwick & boyd, in  press .  On  social  network  sites,  people’s  imagined—or  at  least  intended— audience  is  the  list  of  Friends  that  they  have  chosen  to  connect  with  on  the  site. This is who participants expect to be accessing their content and interact- ing  with  them.  And  these  are  the  people  to  whom  a  participant  is  directing  their  expressions.  By  serving  as  the  imagined  audience,  the  list  of  Friends  serves as the intended public. Of course, just because this collection of people  is the intended public does not mean that it is the actual public. Yet, the value  of  imagining  the  audience  or  public  is  to  adjust  one’s  behavior  and  self-  presentation to fit the intended norms of that collective.   Social Network Sites as Networked Publics    45  Tools for Public Communication  Most social network sites provide various tools to support public or semi- public  interactions  between  participants.  Group  features  allow  participants  to  gather  around shared interests. A more commonly used tool for public encounters is the  commenting feature that displays conversations on a person’s profile  aka “The  Wall”  on  Facebook  and  “Comments”  on  MySpace .  Comments  are  visible  to  anyone who has access to that person’s profile, and participants use this space to  interact with individuals and cohorts. Looking at the content, one might argue  that there is little value to the conversations that take place, especially since teen  conversations can often be boiled down to, “Yo! Wazzup?” “Not much . . . how  you?” “Good . . . whatcha doing?” “Nothing . . . you?” “Nothing. I’m bored.” “Me  too.” While this typed conversation may appear to have little communicative effi- cacy, the ritual of checking in is a form of social grooming. Through mundane  comments, participants are acknowledging one another in a public setting, similar  to the way in which they may greet each other if they were to bump into one  another on the street. Comments are not simply a dialogue between two inter- locutors, but a performance of social connection before a broader audience.   In  conjunction  with  the  comments  section,  both  Facebook  and  MySpace  have  implemented  features  that  allow  participants  to  broadcast  content  to  Friends on the sites. MySpace initially did this with a feature called “bulletins,”  which  allowed  for  blog- esque  messages  to  be  distributed.  After  Facebook  implemented  “status  updates”  to  encourage  the  sharing  of  pithy  messages,  MySpace introduced a similar feature. All of these features allow individuals to  contribute content, which is then broadcast to Friends primarily via a stream  of updates from all of their Friends. In some cases, these updates are then re-  displayed on a person’s profile and available for comments. While individual  updates are arguably mundane, the running stream of content gives particip- ants  a  general  sense  of  those  around  them.  In  doing  so,  participants  get  the  sense of the public constructed by those with whom they connect.   Together,  profiles,  Friends  lists,  and  various  public  communication  chan- nels set the stage for the ways in which social network sites can be understood  as publics. In short, social network sites are publics both because of the ways  in which they connect people en masse and because of the space they provide  for interactions and information. They are networked publics because of the  ways in which networked technologies shape and configure them.  Structural Affordances of Networked Publics  Networked technologies introduce new affordances for amplifying, recording,  and spreading information and social acts. These affordances can shape publics    46    Context  and  how  people  negotiate  them.  While  such  affordances  do  not  determine  social practice, they can destabilize core assumptions people make when engag- ing in social life. As such, they can reshape publics both directly and through  the  practices  that  people  develop  to  account  for  the  affordances.  When  left  unchecked,  networked  technologies  can  play  a  powerful  role  in  controlling  information  and  configuring  interactions.  This  is  one  fault  line  that  prompts  resistance to and demonization of new technologies. Much of the concern stems  from how the technology’s affordances inflect understood practices.   The content of networked publics is made out of bits. Both self- expressions  and  interactions  between  people  produce  bit- based  content  in  networked  publics. Because of properties of bits, bits are easier to store, distribute, and  search than atoms. Four affordances that emerge out of the properties of bits  play a significant role in configuring networked publics:  Persistence:  Online  expressions  are  automatically  recorded   and archived.  Replicability:  Content made out of bits can be duplicated. Scalability:   The  potential  visibility  of  content  in  networked  publics is great.  Searchability: Content  in  networked  publics  can  be  accessed   through search.  To account for the structure of networked publics, I want to map out these differ- ent elements, situate them in a broader discussion of media, and suggest how they  shape networked publics and people’s participation. Although these affordances  are intertwined and co- dependent, I want to begin by looking at each one differ- ently and considering what it contributes to the structure of networked publics.  Persistence: What One Says Sticks Around  While spoken conversations are ephemeral, countless technologies and tech- niques have been developed to capture moments and make them persistent.  The introduction of writing allowed people to create records of events, and  photography provided a tool for capturing a fleeting moment. Yet, as Walter  Ong  2002  has argued, the introduction of literacy did more than provide a  record; it transformed how people thought and communicated. Furthermore,  as Walter Benjamin  1969  has argued, what is captured by photography has a  different essence than the experienced moment. Both writing and photography  provide persistence, but they also transform the acts they are capturing.   Social Network Sites as Networked Publics    47    Internet  technologies  follow  a  long  line  of  other  innovations  in  this  area.  What is captured and recorded are the bytes that are created and exchanged  across the network. Many systems make bits persistent by default and, thus,  the text that one produces becomes persistent. Yet, do people interpret the  content in the same way as they did when it was first produced? This is quite  unlikely.  The  text  and  the  multimedia  may  be  persistent,  but  what  sticks  around may lose its essence when consumed outside of the context in which it  was created. The persistence of conversations in networked publics is ideal for  asynchronous  conversations,  but  it  also  raises  new  concerns  when  it  can  be  consumed outside of its original context.   While recording devices allow people to record specific acts in publics, the  default is typically that unmediated acts are ephemeral. Networked technology  inverted these defaults, making recording a common practice. This is partially  due  to  the  architecture  of  the  Internet,  where  dissemination  requires  copies  and records for transmission and processing. Of course, while original records  and duplicated records can in theory be deleted  or, technically, overwritten   at  any  point  in  the  process,  the  “persistent- by-default,  ephemeral- when- necessary” dynamic is relatively pervasive, rendering tracking down and delet- ing content once it is contributed to networked publics futile.  Replicability: What’s the Original and What’s  the Duplicate?  The printing press transformed writing because it allowed for easy reproduc- tion  of  news  and  information,  increasing  the  potential  circulation  of  such  content  Eisenstein, 1980 . Technology has introduced a series of tools to help  people  duplicate  text,  images,  video,  and  other  media.  Because  bits  can  be  replicated more easily than atoms, and because bits are replicated as they are  shared across the network, the content produced in networked publics is easily  replicable. Copies are inherent to these systems.   In a world of bits, there is no way to differentiate the original bit from its  duplicate.  And,  because  bits  can  be  easily  modified,  content  can  be  trans- formed in ways that make it hard to tell which is the source and which is the  alteration. The replicable nature of content in networked publics means that  what is replicated may be altered in ways that people do not easily realize.  Scalability: What Spreads May Not Be Ideal  Technology enables broader distribution, either by enhancing who can access  the real- time event or widening access to reproductions of the moment. Broad- cast media like TV and radio made it possible for events to be simultaneously    48    Context  experienced across great distances, radically scaling the potential visibility of a  given  act  and  reshaping  the  public  sphere   Starr,  2005 .  While  such  outlets  allow content to scale, distribution outlets are frequently regulated  although  this did not stop “pirates” from creating their own broadcast publics  Walker,  2004  .  The  Internet  introduced  new  possibilities  for  distribution;  blogging  alone  allowed  for  the  rise  of  grassroots  journalism   Gillmor,  2004   and  a  channel for anyone to espouse opinions  Rettberg, 2008 .   The Internet may enable many to broadcast content and create publics, but  it does not guarantee an audience. What scales in networked publics may not  be  what  everyone  wishes  to  scale.  Furthermore,  while  a  niche  group  may  achieve visibility that resembles “micro- celebrity”  Senft, 2008 , only a small  fraction receives mass attention, while many more receive very small, local- ized attention. Scalability in networked publics is about the possibility of tre- mendous visibility, not the guarantee of it.   Habermas’ frustration with broadcast media was rooted in the ways that  broadcast media was, in his mind, scaling the wrong kinds of content  Haber- mas, 1991 . The same argument can be made concerning networked media,  as what scales in networked publics is often the funny, the crude, the embar- rassing, the mean, and the bizarre, “ranging from the quirky and offbeat, to  potty humor, to the bizarrely funny, to parodies, through to the acerbically  ironic”  Knobel & Lankshear, 2007 . Those seeking broad attention, like pol- iticians and wannabe celebrities, may have the ability to share their thoughts  in  networked  publics,  but  they  may  not  achieve  the  scale  they  wish.  The  property  of  scalability  does  not  necessarily  scale  what  individuals  want  to  have  scaled  or  what  they  think  should  be  scaled,  but  what  the  collective  chooses to amplify.  Searchability: Seek and You Shall Find  Librarians and other information specialists have long developed techniques to  make accessing information easier and more effective. Metadata schemes and  other strategies for organizing content have been central to these efforts. Yet,  the introduction of search engines has radically reworked the ways in which  information  can  be  accessed.  Search  has  become  a  commonplace  activity  among Internet users.   As  people  use  technologies  that  leave  traces,  search  takes  on  a  new  role.  While being able to stand in a park and vocalize “find” to locate a person or  object  may  seem  like  an  element  of  a  science  fiction  story,  such  actions  are  increasingly viable in networked publics. Search makes finding people in net- worked publics possible and, as GPS- enabled mobile devices are deployed, we  will see such practices be part of other aspects of everyday life.   Social Network Sites as Networked Publics    49  Central Dynamics in Networked Publics  The  affordances  of  networked  publics  introduce  new  dynamics  with  which  participants  must  contend.  Many  of  these  dynamics  are  not  new,  but  they  were never so generally experienced. Analyzing how broadcast media trans- formed  culture,  Joshua  Meyrowitz   1985   articulated  that  the  properties  of  media change social environments and, thus, influence people and their behav- ior. He examined how broadcast media’s ability to rework scale reconfigured  publics, altered the roles that people play in society, complicated the bounda- ries  between  public  and  private,  collapsed  distinct  social  contexts,  and  rup- tured the salience of physical place in circumscribing publics. Just as many of  the affordances of networked media parallel those of broadcast media, many of  the dynamics that play out in networked publics are an amplification of those  Meyrowitz astutely recognized resulting from broadcast media. Three dynam- ics play a central role in shaping networked publics:  Invisible audiences: Not all audiences are visible when a person  is contributing online, nor are they necessarily co- present.  Collapsed  contexts:  The  lack  of  spatial,  social,  and  temporal  boundaries makes it difficult to maintain distinct social contexts.  The  blurring  of  public  and  private:  Without  control  over  context,  public  and  private  become  meaningless  binaries,  are  scaled in new ways, and are difficult to maintain as distinct.  As  people  engage  with  networked  publics,  they  are  frequently  forced  to  contend with the ways in which these dynamics shape the social environment.  While such dynamics have long been part of some people’s lives, they take on  a  new  salience  in  networked  publics  because  of  their  broad  reach  and  their  pervasiveness in everyday life. Let’s briefly consider each dynamic.  Invisible Audiences: To Whom Should One  Speak?  In unmediated spaces, it is common to have a sense for who is present and can  witness a particular performance. The affordances of networked publics change  this. In theory, people can access content that is persistent, replicable, scalable,  and  searchable  across  broad  swaths  of  space  and  time.  Lurkers  who  share  the  same space but are not visible are one potential audience. But so are those who  go back to read archives or who are searching for content on a particular topic.   50    Context    People in certain professions have long had to contend with invisible audi- ences.  In  producing  content  for  the  camera,  microphone,  or  printing  press,  journalists and actors sometimes prepare for invisible audiences by imagining  the audience and presenting themselves to that imagined audience. When TV  began, studio audiences were tremendously common because it helped people  gauge their performances. This audience was not the complete audience, but  the feedback was still valuable for the performers. Likewise, some journalists  perform for those who provide explicit feedback, intentionally avoiding think- ing about those who are there but invisible. Performing for imagined or partial  audiences can help people handle the invisible nature of their audience. These  practices became a part of life in networked publics, as those who contributed  tried to find a way to locate their acts.   Knowing one’s audience matters when trying to determine what is socially  appropriate  to  say  or  what  will  be  understood  by  those  listening.  In  other  words, audience is critical to context. Without information about audience, it  is often difficult to determine how to behave, let alone to make adjustments  based on assessing reactions. To accommodate this, participants in networked  publics  often  turn  to  an  imagined  audience  to  assess  whether  or  not  they  believe their behavior is socially appropriate, interesting, or relevant.  Collapsed Contexts: Navigating Tricky Social  Situations  Even when one knows one’s audience, it can be challenging to contend with  groups  of  people  who  reflect  different  social  contexts  and  have  different  expectations as to what’s appropriate. For some, the collapsing of contexts in  broadcast  media  made  expressing  oneself  challenging.  Consider  the  case  of  Stokely Carmichael, which Meyrowitz  1985, p. 43  details in his book. Car- michael was a civil rights leader in the 1960s. He regularly gave speeches to  different audiences using different rhetorical styles depending on the race of  the audience. When Carmichael began addressing broad publics via television  and radio, he had to make a choice. There was no neutral speaking style and  Carmichael’s  decision  to  use  black  speaking  style  alienated  white  society.  While Carmichael was able to maintain distinct styles as long as he was able to  segment  social  groups,  he  ran  into  trouble  when  broadcast  media  collapsed  those social groups and, with them, the distinct contexts in which they were  embedded.   Networked publics force everyday people to contend with environments in  which  contexts  are  regularly  colliding.  Even  when  the  immediate  audience  might be understood, the potential audience can be far greater and from dif- ferent  contexts.  Maintaining  distinct  contexts  online  is  particularly  tricky    Social Network Sites as Networked Publics    51  because  of  the  persistent,  replicable,  searchable,  and  scalable  nature  of  net- worked  acts.  People  do  try  to  segment  contexts  by  discouraging  unwanted  audiences from participating, or by trying to limit information to make search- ing more difficult, or by using technologies that create partial walls through  privacy settings. Yet a motivated individual can often circumvent any of these  approaches.   Some  argue  that  distinct  contexts  are  unnecessary  and  only  encourage  people  to  be  deceptive.  This  is  the  crux  of  the  belief  that  only  those  with  something to hide need privacy. What is lost in this approach is the ways in  which context helps people properly contextualize their performances. Bilin- gual speakers choose different languages depending on context, and speakers  explain concepts or describe events differently when talking to different audi- ences based on their assessment of the audience’s knowledge. An alternative  way  to  mark  context  is  as  that  which  provides  the  audience  with  a  better  understanding  of  the  performer’s  biases  and  assumptions.  Few  people  detail  their  life  histories  before  telling  a  story,  but  that  history  is  often  helpful  in  assessing the significance of the story. While starting every statement with “as  a  person  with  X  identity  and  Y  beliefs  and  Z  history”  can  provide  context,  most people do not speak this way, let alone account for all of the relevant  background for any stranger to understand any utterance.   Networked  publics  both  complicate  traditional  mechanisms  for  assessing  and  asserting  context  as  well  as  collapse  contexts  that  are  traditionally  seg- mented. This is particularly problematic because, with the audience invisible  and  the  material  persistent,  it  is  often  difficult  to  get  a  sense  of  what  the  context is or should be. Collapsing of contexts did take place before the rise of  broadcast media, but often in more controlled settings. For example, events  like weddings, in which context collisions are common, are frequently scripted  to make everyone comfortable. Unexpected collisions, like running into one’s  boss  while  out  with  friends,  can  create  awkwardness,  but  since  both  parties  are typically aware of the collision, it can often be easy to make quick adjust- ments  to  one’s  behavior  to  address  the  awkward  situation.  In  networked  publics, contexts often collide such that the performer is unaware of audiences  from different contexts, magnifying the awkwardness and making adjustments  impossible.  Blurring of Public and Private: Where are the  Boundaries?  Additionally, as networked publics enable social interactions at all levels, the  effects of these dynamics are felt at much broader levels than those felt by  broadcast  media  and  the  introduction  of  other  forms  of  media  to  publics.    52    Context  These dynamics alter interactions among very large and broad collections of  people, but they also complicate the dynamics among friend groups and col- lections of peers. They alter practices that are meant for broad visibility and  they  complicate—and  often  make  public—interactions  that  were  never  intended to be truly public. This stems from the ways in which networked  media, like broadcast media  Meyrowitz, 1985 , blurs public and private in  complicated  ways.  For  those  in  the  spotlight,  broadcast  media  often  appeared  to  destroy  privacy.  This  is  most  visible  through  the  way  tabloid  media complicated the private lives of celebrities, feeding on people’s desire  to get backstage access  Turner, 2004 . As networked publics brought the  dynamics  of  broadcast  media  to  everyday  people,  participants  have  turned  their  social  curiosity  toward  those  who  are  more  socially  local   Solove,  2007 .   Some argue that privacy is now dead  Garfinkel, 2001  and that we should  learn to cope and embrace a more transparent society  Brin, 1999 . That is a  naive  stance,  both  because  privacy  has  been  reshaped  during  other  trans- formative  moments  in  history   Jagodzinski,  1999   and  because  people  have  historically developed strategies for maintaining aspects of privacy even when  institutions  and  governments  seek  to  eliminate  it   McDougall  &  Hansson,  2002; Toch, 1992 . For these reasons, I argue that privacy is simply in a state  of  transition  as  people  try  to  make  sense  of  how  to  negotiate  the  structural  transformations resulting from networked media.   People  value  privacy  for  diverse  reasons,  including  the  ability  to  have  control over information about themselves and their own visibility  Rossler,  2004,  pp.  6–8 .  Social  network  sites  disrupt  the  social  dynamics  of  privacy   Grimmelmann,  2009 .  Most  importantly,  they  challenge  people’s  sense  of  control. Yet, just because people are adopting tools that radically reshape their  relationship  to  privacy  does  not  mean  they  are  interested  in  giving  up  their  privacy.   Defining  and  controlling  boundaries  around  public  and  private  can  be  quite difficult in a networked society, particularly when someone is motiv- ated  to  publicize  something  that  is  seemingly  private  or  when  technology  complicates people’s ability to control access and visibility. What remains an  open  question  is  how  people  can  regain  a  sense  of  control  in  a  networked  society. Helen Nissenbaum  2004  argues that we need to approach privacy  through  the  lens  of  contextual  integrity,  at  least  in  terms  of  legal  protec- tions. I believe that we need to examine people’s strategies for negotiating  control  in  the  face  of  structural  conditions  that  complicate  privacy  and  rethink  our  binary  conceptions  of  public  and  private.  While  public  and  private  are  certainly  in  flux,  it  is  unlikely  that  privacy  will  simply  be  disregarded.   Social Network Sites as Networked Publics    53  Transformation of Publics  While I have accounted for the ways in which the affordances of networked  publics  and  the  dynamics  that  unfold  mirror  those  which  take  place  due  to  other  technologies  or  for  distinct  populations,  what  is  significant  about  this  stems from how such factors are more broadly transforming everyday life for  broad  swaths  of  the  public  at  large.  The  affordances  of  networked  publics  rework publics more generally and the dynamics that emerge leak from being  factors in specific settings to being core to everyday realities.   The  changes  brought  on  by  networked  technologies  are  more  pervasive  than those by earlier media. Because content and expressions contributed to  networked publics is persistent and replicable by default, the possibility of acts  being  scaled,  searchable,  and  thus  viewed  is  heightened.  Physical  spaces  are  limited  by  space  and  time,  but,  online,  people  can  connect  to  one  another  across great distances and engage with asynchronously produced content over  extended  periods.  This  allows  people  to  work  around  physical  barriers  to  interaction and reduces the cost of interacting with people in far- off places.   Yet, at the same time, many people are unmotivated to interact with distant  strangers;  their  attention  is  focused  on  those  around  them.  Andy  Warhol  argued that mass media would guarantee that, “in the future everyone will be  world- famous  for  fifteen  minutes”   Hirsch,  Kett,  &  Trefil,  2002 .  As  new  media  emerged,  artists  and  writers  countered  this  claim  by  noting,  “in  the  future  everyone  will  be  famous  for  fifteen  people”   Momus,  1992;  Wein- berger, 2002, p. 104 . In networked publics, attention becomes a commodity.  There are those who try to manipulate the potential scalability of these envi- ronments to reach wide audiences, including politicians and pundits. There are  also those who become the object of widespread curiosity and are propelled  into  the  spotlight  by  the  interwoven  network.  There  are  also  the  countless  who are not seeking or gaining widespread attention. Yet, in an environment  where following the content of one’s friends involves the same technologies as  observing  the  follies  of  a  celebrity,  individuals  find  themselves  embedded  in  the attention economy, as consumers and producers. While new media can be  reproduced  and  scaled  far  and  wide,  it  does  not  address  the  ways  in  which  attention is a limited resource.   Persistence  and  replicability  also  complicate  notions  of  “authenticity,”  as  acts and information are not located in a particular space or time and, because  of the nature of bits, it is easy to alter content, making it more challenging to  assess its origins and legitimacy. This issue has long been a part of discussions  about  reproductions  and  recordings,  with  Walter  Benjamin   1969,  p.  220   suggesting that art detached from its time and space loses its “aura,” and Philip  Auslander   1999,  p.  85   arguing  that  aura  is  in  the  relationship  between    54    Context  performances  and  their  recordings.  Authenticity  is  at  stake  in  networked  publics  because  altering  content  in  networked  publics  is  both  easy  and  common. Code, text, images, and videos are frequently modified or remixed.  While remix is politically contentious, it reflects an active and creative engage- ment  with  cultural  artifacts   Lessig,  2005 ,  amplifying  ongoing  efforts  by  people  to  make  mass  culture  personally  relevant  by  obliterating  the  distinc- tions  between  consumers  and  producers.  How  people  alter  content  in  net- worked  publics  varies.  Alterations  can  be  functional   e.g.,  altering  code  to  make  it  work  in  a  new  environment ,  aesthetic   e.g.,  altering  images  to  remove  red  eye ,  political   e.g.,  modifying  famous  photos  to  make  political  statements  Jenkins, 2006  , or deceptive  e.g., altering text to make it appear  as though something was said that was not . This magnifies questions of what  is original, what is a copy, and when does it matter?   While there are limits to how many people can be in one physical space at a  time, networked publics support the gathering of much larger groups, synchro- nously and asynchronously. Networked publics make one- to-many and many-  to-many interactions far easier. In essence, networked media allows anyone to  be a media outlet  Gillmor, 2004 , and with this comes the potential of scalabil- ity. Yet an increase in people’s ability to contribute to publics does not neces- sarily result in an increase in their ability to achieve an audience. The potentials  of  scalability  raise  questions  about  the  possible  democratizing  role  that  net- worked  media  can  play  when  anyone  can  participate  and  contribute  to  the  public good  e.g., Benkler, 2006 . Unfortunately, networked publics appear to  reproduce  many  of  the  biases  that  exist  in  other  publics—social  inequalities,  including social stratification around race, gender, sexuality, and age, are repro- duced online  Chen & Wellman, 2005; Hargittai, 2008 . Political divisions are  also reproduced  Adamic & Glance, 2005  such that even when content scales  in  visibility,  it  may  not  cross  sociopolitical  divisions.  Those  using  networked  media  to  contribute  to  the  dissemination  of  news  selectively  amplify  stories  introduced by traditional media outlets, replicating offline cultural foci  Zuck- erman,  2008 .  Although  networked  publics  support  mass  dissemination,  the  dynamics of “media contagion”  Marlow, 2005  show that what spreads depends  on the social structure underlying the networked publics. In other words, scala- bility is dependent on more than just the properties of bits.  Implications for Analysis  The affordances of networked publics and the resultant dynamics that emerge  are transforming publics. While marking networked publics as a distinct genre  of  publics  is  discursively  relevant  at  this  moment,  it  is  also  important  to  acknowledge that the affordances of networked publics will increasingly shape    Social Network Sites as Networked Publics    55  publics more broadly. As social network sites and other genres of social media  become increasingly widespread, the distinctions between networked publics  and publics will become increasingly blurry. Thus, the dynamics mapped out  here will not simply be constrained to the domain of the digital world, but will  be part of everyday life.   The rise of social network sites has introduced ever- increasing populations  to  the  trials  and  tribulations  of  navigating  networked  publics.  Many  of  the  struggles that take place on social network sites are shaped by the properties of  bits, the affordances of networked publics, and the resultant dynamics. While  some of the specific factors are not unique to networked publics, the preva- lence of social network sites has introduced these affordances and dynamics to  a much broader subset of the population.   This is not to say that what emerges in social network sites is simply deter- mined  by  the  technical  affordances,  or  that  the  dynamics  described  here  predict practices. Rather, participants are implicitly and explicitly contending  with these affordances and dynamics as a central part of their participation. In  essence, people are learning to work within the constraints and possibilities of  mediated  architecture,  just  as  people  have  always  learned  to  navigate  struc- tures as part of their daily lives.   In  my  earlier  analysis  on  American  teenagers’  participation  in  social  network sites  boyd, 2008 , I highlighted that teens can and do develop strat- egies  for  managing  the  social  complexities  of  these  environments.  In  some  ways, teens are more prepared to embrace networked publics because many  are coming of age in a time when networked affordances are a given. Adults,  on the other hand, often find the shifts brought on by networked publics to be  confusing and discomforting because they are more acutely aware of the ways  in  which  their  experiences  with  public  life  are  changing.  Yet,  even  they  are  adjusting to these changes and developing their own approaches to reconfigur- ing the technology to meet their needs.   As social network sites and other emergent genres of social media become  pervasive, the affordances and dynamics of networked publics can shed light  on why people engage the way they do. Thus, taking the structural elements  of networked publics into account when analyzing what unfolds can provide a  valuable interpretive framework. Architecture shapes and is shaped by practice  in mediated environments just as in physical spaces.  References  Adamic,  L.  A.  &  Glance,  N.   2005 .

Social network sites have become such an  obsession  with  some  that  they  raise  concerns  about  the  potential  harmful  effects of their repeated use, known in the popular press as “Facebook addic- tion”  Cohen, 2009 . For many Internet users, social networking has perhaps  indeed  become  a  media  habit,  defined   after  LaRose,  2010;  Verplanken  &  Wood, 2006  as a form of automaticity in media consumption that develops as  people  repeat  media  consumption  behavior  in  stable  circumstances.  How  might  repeated  social  networking  evolve  from  a  “good”  habit  that  merely  indulges  a  personal  media  preference  into  a  “bad”  habit  with  potentially  harmful life consequences that might rightfully be termed compulsive, prob- lematic, pathological, or addictive? And, is social networking any more or less  problematic than other popular Internet activities?   Although the extent of Internet pathology by any name, and indeed its very  existence, are open to question  Shaffer, Hall, & Vander Bilt, 2000; Widyanto  &  Griffiths,  2007 ,  the  attention  of  scholars  continues  to  be  drawn  to  the  harmful effects of excessive Internet consumption. In a national survey, 6% of  U.S.  adults  said  a  relationship  had  suffered  as  a  result  of  their  Internet  use   Aboujaoude,  Koran,  Gamel,  Large,  &  Serpe,  2006 .  Correlational  studies  have linked Internet use and psycho- social maladjustment  e.g., Caplan, 2007;  LaRose,  Lin,  &  Eastin,  2003;  McKenna  &  Bargh,  2000;  Morahan- Martin  &  Schumacher, 2000; Young & Rogers, 1998 . Internet usage disorder has been  proposed as a new category of mental illness  Block, 2008 , including a sub-  category of email text messaging that might subsume social networking.   Whether  social  networking  habits  are  especially  problematic  or  not,  they  are a distinctive media consumption phenomenon that harkens back to previ- ous  studies  of  television  addictions   Kubey  &  Csikszentmihalyi,  2002 .  An  understanding  of  Internet  habits  can  extend  models  of  media  behavior  to    60    Context  incorporate  habitual,  automatic  consumption  patterns  as  well  as  those  that  result from active selection processes  LaRose & Eastin, 2004 . The current  premise is that problematic media behaviors are habits that have gotten out of  control  cf. Marlatt, Baer, Donovan, & Kivlahan, 1988  and that they begin as  media favorites, defined here as the preferred media activity within a particu- lar medium. Media favorites are themselves habits, as evident when items now  recognized as indicators of habit strength  e.g., watching “because it is there”  and because “it is part of a daily ritual”  entered into a factor analysis of the  uses and gratifications of favorite TV program types  Bantz, 1982 . Verplanken  and  Orbell   2003   found  that  media  consumption  was  highly  correlated  to  habit strength while Wood, Quinn, and Kashy  2002  reported that over half  of all media behaviors recorded in an experience sampling study were habit-  driven. Yet clearly not all media habits spin out of control to become prob- lematic,  so  how  might  we  explain  why  some  do  and  others  do  not?  And  is  social networking one of the habits that is especially likely to do so?   Two competing explanations of problematic media habits have emerged in  the communication literature: a social skill account that explains Problematic  Internet  Use   PIU   as  compensation  for  social  incompetence  in  the  offline  world  Caplan, 2005  and a socio- cognitive model of unregulated media use   LaRose et al., 2003 . The present research comparatively evaluates and then  integrates these two perspectives. To arrive at an understanding of social net- working  habits  and  their  potential  for  abuse,  we  will  first  integrate  the  two  perspectives.  The Social Skill Model of PIU  Caplan  2005, p. 721  defined PIU as a “multidimensional syndrome consist- ing  of  cognitive  and  behavioral  symptoms  that  result  in  negative  social,  aca- demic or professional consequences.” Building on Davis’  2001  description of  pathological Internet use in relation to symptoms of impulse control disorders,  and on other researchers who drew upon symptoms of pathological gambling  and substance abuse, Caplan  2002  developed a multidimensional measure of  PIU  dimensions.  They  were  mood  alteration,  social  benefits,  negative  out- comes,  compulsivity,  excessive  time,  preoccupation,  and  interpersonal  control.   Predicated  on  repeated  observations  that  negative  life  consequences  are  especially  associated  with  social  uses  of  the  Internet,  the  social  skill  model  posits that compulsive Internet use is the direct result of preference for online  social interaction  “social benefits” in the earlier factor analysis , which in turn  is inversely related to self- presentational skills  previously dubbed “interper- sonal  control” .  Compulsive  use  was  the  causal  antecedent  of  negative    Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    61  outcomes of Internet use, such as missing social engagements. Thus, the social  skill account explained PIU as a form of compensation for defective real- world  social skills. This model was a moderately good fit, accounting for 10% of the  variance in negative outcomes  Caplan, 2005 .   The resulting social skill model omitted three dimensions of PIU  Caplan,  2003 : mood alteration, excessive time, and withdrawal. These additional var- iables can be interpreted within the competing socio- cognitive model.  The Socio- Cognitive Model of Unregulated  Internet Use  In  the  socio- cognitive  model  of  unregulated  Internet  use   LaRose  et  al.,  2003 , expected outcomes are key determinants of media behavior. So, for  example, the expectation that social networking will relieve loneliness should  predict  social  networking  use.  This  corresponds  to  the  “mood  alteration”  dimension of PIU. Internet usage is also determined by self- efficacy, or belief  in one’s capability to organize and execute a particular course of action, such  as  the  person’s  perceived  ability  to  use  social  networking  to  make  new  friends.   The  socio- cognitive  self- regulatory  mechanism  describes  how  humans  exercise—but also how they may lose—control over media behavior. Defi- cient  self- regulation  is  defined  as  a  state  in  which  self- regulatory  processes  become  impaired  and  self- control  over  media  use  is  diminished   LaRose  et  al., 2003 . In the model of unregulated Internet use, overall Internet usage  was a function of self- reactive outcome expectations and self- efficacy. Usage  was further predicted by two dimensions of deficient self- regulation, one of  which was associated with lack of awareness and attention2 and a second that  was associated with lack of controllability and intentionality.3 The latter was  causally related to the former and was itself predicted in turn by self- reactive  outcome expectations and self- efficacy. Self- efficacy was also causally related  to self- reactive outcome expectations and to the controllability intentionality  variable.  New Perspectives of Habitual Behavior  Deficient  self- regulation  aligns  with  conceptions  of  habit  found  in  current  research  in  social  psychology   e.g.,  Verplanken  &  Orbell,  2003;  Wood  &  Neal,  2007   that  define  habits  as  a  form  of  automaticity,  which  in  turn  is  thought to have four facets: lack of awareness, lack of attention, lack of con- trollability,  and  lack  of  intentionality.  The  dimensions  underlying  the  con- struct  are  unclear,  however.  Verplanken  and  Orbell   2003   arrived  at  a    62    Context  unidimensional solution that incorporated three of the four facets of automa- ticity.4  LaRose  et  al.   2003   empirically  derived  two  dimensions  that  incorporated  all  four,  as  described  above.  Caplan’s   2002   compulsive  use  dimension reflected a lack of controllability  “Unsuccessful attempts to control  use”  while his withdrawal dimension had items that Verplanken and Orbell   2003  identified with inattention  “Miss being online if I can’t go on it”  and  the excessive time dimension betrayed a lack of intentionality  “Go online for  longer time than I intended” .   Recent developments in the neurology and social psychology of automatic- ity  call  for  a  conceptual  re- assessment.  On  a  neurological  level,  repeated  behaviors  gradually  shift  from  conscious  cortical  control  to  automated  responses  governed  by  the  basal  ganglia,  a  group  of  nuclei  in  the  cerebrum   Yin & Knowlton, 2006 . Thus, consciously framed reasons for Internet use,  such  as  Caplan’s  mood  alteration  dimension,  are  distinguishable  from  habit.  The four facets of automaticity are independent in that they can be manipu- lated  separately   Saling  &  Phillips,  2007   so  the  differing  number  of  dimen- sions  may  reflect  varying  combinations  among  the  four  dimensions  of  automaticity that are found across behaviors  Saling & Phillips, 2007 .   Caplan’s  2002  dimensions of compulsive use, excessive time, and with- drawal included items that correspond to lack of controllability, intentionality,  and attention, respectively, but a dimension indicating lack of awareness was  not found.   The socio- cognitive concept of self- regulation incorporates all four facets of  automaticity, and these can be re- framed in terms of sub-processes of the self-  regulatory  mechanism   Bandura,  1986 .  Here,  deficient  self- regulation  is  abandoned  in  favor  of  habit  as  an  umbrella  concept  describing  the  overall  weakness  of  self- regulation  that  encompasses  two  sub- processes  associated  with  habits.  Habit  formation  is  in  part  a  deficiency  in  self- observation.  As  behavior is repeated, individuals become less attentive to the immediate con- sequences of its performance and rely on cognitive shortcuts to prompt behav- ior,  such  as  environmental  cues  or  internal  mood  states,  rather  than  consciously considering the behavior on each successive occurrence. This con- serves  scarce  attentional  resources,  freeing  the  individual  to  process  new  information while placing repeated choices “on automatic,” below the level of  conscious awareness. Habits are maintained through a failure of self- reaction,  the mechanism through which individuals apply their own incentives to modify  their behavior and its outcomes, such as administering rewards for moderate  behavior  or  indulging  feelings  of  guilt  for  excessive  media  behavior.  In  the  absence  of  such  corrective  measures,  deficient  self- reaction  also  diminishes  attentiveness  to  behavior  and  therefore  contributes  to  deficient  self-  observation.   Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    63  An Integrated Model of Internet Habits  The  socio- cognitive  model  of  unregulated  Internet  use  therefore  incorporates  dimensions of PIU not found in the social skill account of the syndrome. The  mood alteration dimension of PIU  Caplan, 2002  corresponds to self- reactive  outcome  expectations,  withdrawal  is  related  to  deficient  self- observation,  and  excessive use is located in deficient self- reaction along with compulsivity. The  socio- cognitive model of unregulated Internet use described above arrays these  in a causal model suggested by a well- established theory of human behavior. Both  models may now be understood to explain habitual Internet behavior, one focus- ing on the amount of consumption and the other on its consequences.   Comparing the two, the social skill account identifies negative life outcomes as  a separate, dependent variable. Since such outcomes are a necessary condition for  the diagnosis of impulse control disorders  Shaffer et al., 2000 , this is an import- ant addition. Three changes in terminology will help to further integrate the two  models: Compulsive use is re- labeled deficient self- reaction to be consistent with  the social cognitive model. Negative outcomes from Caplan’s model are desig- nated as negative life consequences to avoid confusion with outcome expectations  in the SCT model. Finally, the antecedent variable of the social skill account is re-  labeled deficient social skill to reflect the wording of its operational definition and  clarify its conceptual relationship to preference for online social interaction.   Substituting  negative  life  consequences  for  overall  Internet  usage  as  the  dependent variable produces a socio- cognitive model of PIU shown in Figure 3.1.  The rationale is the time inelasticity hypothesis  Nie, 2001  that holds that time  spent on the Internet subtracts from the time available for other activities. Con- sistent with this view, an excessive time factor had a significant and positive zero-  order  correlation  with  negative  outcomes5   Caplan,  2003   and  the  operational  definition of the latter asks about harm to other activities that result from Internet  use. The substitution of negative consequences for Internet usage, rather than its  addition  to  the  previous  LaRose  et  al.   2003   model,  is  to  achieve  parsimony;  otherwise,  the  Social  Cognitive  model  of  PIU  would  include  links  to  negative  consequences  not  only  from  usage  but  also  from  the  other  variables  related  to  usage in the original model. Also for parsimony’s sake, self- efficacy can be deleted  on the assumption that sufficient levels of self- efficacy are achieved in the process  of elevating an activity to a favorite so that the former becomes inoperative as a  predictor of usage and hence of the negative life consequences that might follow.  H1:  Negative  life  consequences  of  favorite  Internet  activities  are  explained  by  depression,  self- reactive  outcome  expecta- tions, deficient self- observation, and deficient self- reaction.   64    Context  Self-reactive  outcome  expectations  0.15  0.18  0.21  0.24  Depression  Deficient  �0.13  self-observation  Negative  consequences  0.33  0.20  0.21  0.50  Deficient  self-reaction  Figure 3.1  Socio-cognitive model of problematic Internet use.  This model provides an alternative explanation of negative life consequences  from  the  social  skills  account.  Depression  causes  a  negative  cognitive  bias  through which individuals slight their own successes at maintaining self- control  and blame themselves for failure  Bandura, 1991 , thus undermining effective  self- reaction. Dysphoric moods also stimulate the seeking of self- reactive out- comes  or “mood alteration” in Caplan, 2002  to dispel those moods  see also  Zillmann & Bryant, 1985 . Repeated efforts to obtain self- reactive outcomes  cause  deficient  self- observation  as  behavioral  control  shifts  to  non- conscious  processes  governed  by  the  basal  ganglia   Yin  &  Knowlton,  2006 .  Self-  observation is also weakened by deficient self- reaction as individuals abandon  attempts to regulate their Internet behavior, making it less subject to conscious  internal scrutiny. The conscious pursuit of favorite activities to cheer oneself  up or to relieve loneliness causes mounting use, the socio- cognitive version of  the  classic  “active  media  selection”  hypothesis  of  uses  and  gratifications  research   LaRose  &  Eastin,  2004 .  Deficient  self- reaction  and  deficient  self-  observation also lead to mounting use as self- regulation fails and habit strength  increases.  Finally,  the  time  allocated  to  favorite  activities  interferes  with  important activities, producing negative life consequences.   The social skill model can be incorporated by adding deficient social skills  and preference for online interaction as antecedent variables to deficient self-    Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    65  reaction.  Depression  causes  deficient  social  skills  by  impairing  interpersonal  communication  and  inviting  rejection   Segrin  &  Abramson,  1994 .  Also,  a  preference  for  online  social  interaction  would  likely  result  from  successful  efforts  to  relieve  dysphoric  moods  through  online  interactions.  Thus,  self-  reactive  outcome  expectations  should  cause  a  preference  for  online  social  interaction  Figure 3.2 .  H2:  Depression  will  be  positively  related  to  deficient  social  skill.  H3:  Self- reactive  outcome  expectations  will  be  positively  related to preference for online social interaction.  Is Social Networking More Problematic Than  Other Online Activities?  A wide variety of online activities have been identified as “addictive”  Block,  2008   and,  although  social  networking  is  not  currently  among  them,  it  is  perhaps only a function of the relative newness of the activity. However, the  appropriateness  of  the  term  “addictive”  and  related  constructions,  including   Self-reactive  outcome  expectations  0.15  Deficient  self-reaction  0.15  0.15  0.21  0.24  Depression  0.20  Deficient  social skill  0.25  Preference online social interaction  Deficient  self-  observation  �0.13  Negative  consequences  0.33  0.18  0.20  0.21  0.50  Figure 3.2  Integrated model of PIU.   66    Context  compulsive, pathological, and problematic, are themselves problematic in that  there appear to be so few truly addictive compulsive pathological problem- atic  users  included  in  such  research  that  they  are  more  properly  considered  studies of online media habits in normal populations. That is because the cri- teria used to assess pathology, by whatever name, are based on self- reported  responses to interval level scales with the average levels of endorsement typic- ally at or below the midpoint of the scales among the general student popula- tions that are typical of this stream of research. And, self- reports of symptoms   e.g., agreeing that family relationships have been damaged as a result of social  networking  based  on  one  or  two  instances  of  being  late  for  dinner   are  lax  compared  to  the  assessments  of  trained  clinicians.  Also,  the  self- reported  symptoms  fail  to  rule  out  other  psychiatric  conditions   e.g.,  mania,  impulse  control  disorders,  pathological  gambling,  sexual  compulsions   that  may  explain the behavior in question. Using rigorous criteria that would attribute  pathology only to those who strongly agree that they have suffered significant  life consequences as a result of Internet use, it can be estimated that poten- tially problematic or addictive cases constitute something in the order of 1%  to 5% of college student populations  e.g., Caplan, 2005; Dowling & Quirk,  2009 ,  a  handful  of  possible  cases  among  the  hundreds  included  in  such  surveys. As yet, there appears to be no research that offers a comparative anal- ysis  of  the  “addictiveness”  of  social  networking  in  relation  to  other  popular  online pursuits.   If those were not truly studies of Internet addiction, then perhaps they were  studies  of  Internet  habits.  The  criteria  used  were  drawn  from  the  same  sources, namely, the DSM IV criteria for pathological gambling and impulse  control  disorders   American  Psychiatric  Association,  1994   as  measures  of  deficient self- regulation, and most of the items used in the operational defini- tions  also  match  items  from  a  validated  measure  of  habits   the  SRHI,  Ver- planken & Orbell, 2003 .   There has been previous research of social networking habits, although not  conducted under that rubric. Facebook Intensity  Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe,  2007   was  operationally  defined   no  conceptual  definition  was  provided   by  the number of Facebook friends, the amount of time spent on Facebook in a  typical  day,  and  several  Likert- type  questions  that  arguably  included  items  tapping  deficient  self- observation   “Facebook  has  become  part  of  my  daily  routine” and “Facebook is part of my everyday activity”  and of deficient self-  reaction   “I  feel  out  of  touch  when  I  haven’t  logged  onto  Facebook  for  a  while” . The average scores on the indicators of deficient self- observation were  near the midpoints of the scales, indicating a moderate degree of habit forma- tion. Internet uses  Bessiere, Kiesler, Kraut, & Boneva, 2008  conform to an  often- used   if  flawed,  see  LaRose,  2010   measure  of  Internet  habits  in  that    Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    67  they ask respondents to indicate the frequency of past behavior. The “commu- nicating with family and friends” and “communicating to meet people” dimen- sions  thus  can  be  construed  to  represent  habitual  use  of  online  social  networking. These were relatively weak habits, averaging 1–2 days a week for  family  and  friends  and  close  to  “never”  for  meeting  new  people,  although  it  should be noted that these data were collected before social networking serv- ices were established. Still, it is interesting to note that communication with  family  and  friends  was  indulged  more  frequently  than  information  or  enter- tainment  habits.  Also,  the  communication  habits  were  moderately  to  highly  correlated  0.60–0.54  with entertainment escape uses, the latter being pos- sible indicators of the pursuit of self- reactive outcomes in the present account.  However,  neither  study  offered  unambiguous  comparisons  of  the  habit-  forming potential of social networking compared to other online activities.   Consistent with the social skill account, a preference for online social inter- action should logically play a more important role in activities that focus on  social  interaction,  such  as  social  networking  and  messaging,  than  those  in  which social interaction is more peripheral, such as downloading media files,  online shopping, and online games. That is because the most natural way of  making up for social deficiencies in the offline world and expressing a prefer- ence  for  online  social  interaction  would  seem  to  be  participation  in  online  socializing.  Both  the  absolute  level  of  the  preference  for  online  social  inter- action  and  the  magnitude  of  its  relationship  to  deficient  self- reaction   called  “compulsive use” in the original social skills account of Caplan, 2005  should  thus  be  greatest  for  online  social  activities.  And  if  compensation  for  offline  social  deficiencies  is  what  makes  the  Internet  especially  “problematic,”  then  negative  consequences  should  be  more  strongly  associated  with  that  prefer- ence among social activities than for other activities.  H4:  a.  Preference  for  online  social  interaction  and  b.  deficient  social skills will be greater among those with social activities as  favorite Internet activities than for other activities.  H5: Social activities will have more negative consequences than  for other activities.  H6:  a.  Deficient  social  skill  will  be  more  related  to  preference  for  online  social  interaction  and  b.  in  turn  it  will  be  more  related  to  deficient  self- reaction  for  social  activities  than  others.   68    Context  The socio- cognitive model makes no a priori assumptions about which Inter- net  activities  are  more  problematic  than  others  but  does  suggest  a  means  to  identify  the  ones  most  likely  to  lead  to  problems:  activities  that  become  a  primary means of relieving dysphoric moods. So, Internet pastimes with high  levels  of  self- reactive  outcome  expectations  and  with  the  strongest  relation- ships  between  those  expectations  and  the  other  variables  in  the  model  are  arguably the most likely to lead to serious life consequences. Thus, the follow- ing question might be answered:  RQ1: Which Internet activities are most problematic?  The present research integrates social skill and socio- cognitive perspectives of  PIU. By examining social networking in comparison to other online activities,  it tests the key assumptions underlying the social skill model and furthers our  understanding of potentially harmful Internet habits.  Method  Participants  Students from two Midwestern universities enrolled in introductory commu- nication classes were invited to participate in an online survey for extra credit.  To diversify the sample, 134 students were surveyed at random from the on-  campus student population at one of the universities  completion rate of 27% .  This yielded 635 usable cases; 58% were female and 42% were male, with a  median age of 20  range 18 to 50 .  Measures  Each  respondent’s  favorite  leisure  activity  on  the  Internet  was  the  frame  of  reference. Eleven options were pre- listed6 and 7% listed “other” favorites. The  latter included a number of responses that could be matched to the pre- listed  categories  e.g., eBay was recoded in the online shopping category . Distinc- tive “other” responses included “reading,” webcomics, online forums, fantasy  sports, news, and browsing surfing. Since all of the latter involved download- ing information from the Internet and were said to be leisure activities, it was  decided  to  group  them  with  the  “downloading  entertainment”  category   24.4%  of  respondents .  Similarly,  chat,  instant  messenger  and  email  were  combined into “messaging”  21.1% , online shopping and auctions into “shop- ping”  2.4% , and online gaming and gambling into “gaming”  10.4% . Social  networking accounted for the remaining favorites  41.6% .   Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    69    To  clarify  the  overlapping  operational  definitions  of  habit- related  con- structs, an exploratory factor analysis was performed on items from LaRose et  al.’s  2003  measures of deficient self- regulation, Caplan’s  2002  PIU scale,  and  the  Self- Report  Habit  Index   SHRI,  Verplanken  &  Orbell,  2003 .  This  yielded  three  dimensions  interpreted  to  be  deficient  self- observation   mean = 4.77,  sd = 1.37,  α = 0.88 ,7  deficient  self- reaction   mean = 2.77,  sd = 1.25, α = 0.87 ,8 and negative life consequences  mean = 2.02, sd = 1.25,  α = 0.87 .9  Except  where  noted,  seven- point  Likert  type  rating  scales  were  used throughout. Self- reactive  outcome  expectations   mean = 4.05,  sd = 1.45,  α = 0.82     were  borrowed  from  LaRose  et  al.   2003 .10  Depression  was  measured  by  three  items  from  Mirowsky  and  Ross’   1992   short  version  of  the  CES- D  depression scale, scored 1 for rarely or none of the time  less than one day in  the  last  week   to  4  for  all  of  the  time   5–7  days    mean = 1.76,  sd = 0.63,  α = 0.73 .11 Self- efficacy was measured with three items specific to the focal  favorite activity  mean = 4.99, sd = 1.08, α = 0.71 .12 Deficient social skill was  represented  by  two  items   mean = 4.71,  sd = 1.19,  α = 0.62   from  the  Self  Monitoring  Scale   Lennox  &  Wolfe,  1984 .13  Preference  for  online  social  interaction  mean = 3.38, sd = 1.48, α = 0.87 , was measured by three items  from Caplan  2005 .14 Internet usage was the minutes spent on Internet on a  typical weekday and weekend day, transformed by log10  value +1  and added   mean = 3.97, sd = 0.95, α = 0.72 .  Data Analysis  Missing data were replaced with mean values for each component item and the  items in each scale were averaged. SPSS version 16.0  SPSS, 2007  was used  for item analysis and the analysis of means. To prepare for path analysis, the  multi- item  indices  were  trimmed  to  retain  the  three  to  five  items  with  the  highest item–total correlations. The AMOS 16.0  Arbuckle, 2007  structural  equation modeling  SEM  program was used to test hypothesized path models.  First, the path models previously reported in LaRose et al.  2003  and Caplan   2005  were replicated. Then, the socio- cognitive model of negative life con- sequences  resulting  from  Internet  use,  shown  in  Figure  3.1,  was  tested.  Finally, an integrated model incorporating both the socio- cognitive and social  skills components was examined, shown in Figure 3.2.   Multigroup analysis was used to compare path coefficients across favorite activ- ities by imposing cross- group equality constraints. The chi- square of the model  with each path coefficient constrained to equality was compared against that of the  unconstrained model. If the model fit of the constrained model was significantly  worse than that of the unconstrained model, it was concluded that the coefficient    70    Context  Results  was significantly different across groups  Kline, 1998 . Those listing online shop- ping as their favorite activity were too few to support a separate analysis.  Considering  that  CFI  and  NFI  indices  over  0.90  indicate  acceptable  fit   Bentler, 1990; Bollen, 1990 , while RMSEA values below 0.06 mean a good  fit   MacCallum,  Brown,  &  Sugawara,  1996 ,  the  socio- cognitive  model  of  unregulated Internet usage  LaRose et al., 2003  was confirmed in these data     χ2  3  = 0.211, n.s., NFI = 0.999, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00 . This model  differed from Figure 3.1 in that Internet usage rather than negative life con- sequences was the ultimate dependent variable and self- efficacy preceded each  of the other variables, save for depression. As was expected when examining  favorite  activities,  self- efficacy  was  a  significant  predictor  of  neither  Internet  usage  r = 0.03, n.s.  nor negative life consequences  r = –0.06, n.s. , support- ing the decision to eliminate self- efficacy to achieve greater parsimony.   The social skill model of PIU  Caplan, 2005  did not fit the current data  well    χ2   3  = 34.7,  p < 0.001,  NFI = 0.889,  CFI = 0.897,  RMSEA = 0.129 .  The modification indices suggested a correlated error term between deficient  social skills and compulsive Internet use  deficient self- reaction in the current  terminology .  This  yielded  a  good  fitting  model    χ2   2  = 3.637,  n.s.,  NFI = 0.988, CFI = 0.995, RMSEA = 0.036 , albeit not one explicable through  the social skills account.   The  socio- cognitive  model  of  PIU   Figure  3.1   was  a  good  fit    χ2   2  = 2.583, n.s., NFI = 0.993, CFI = 0.998, RMSEA = 0.021  and explained  33% of the variance in negative life consequences. All of the expected causal  links among variables were confirmed with path coefficients significant at the  0.001  level.  Depression  predicted  self- reactive  outcome  expectations    β = 0.15  and deficient self- reaction   β = 0.20 . Self- reactive outcome expec- tations  preceded  deficient  self- reaction    β = 0.18 ,  deficient  self- observation    β = 0.21 , and negative life consequences   β = 0.24 . Deficient self- reaction  also preceded deficient self- observation   β = 0.21  and negative consequences    β = 0.50 .  Finally,  deficient  self- observation  also  predicted  negative  con- sequences    β = –0.13 ,  but  this  was  an  inverse  relationship  rather  than  the  positive  relationship  found  in  the  earlier  model  of  unregulated  Internet  use   LaRose et al., 2003 . With this exception, Hypothesis 1 extending the model  of unregulated Internet use to a model of PIU was confirmed.   Adding two variables suggested by the social skills account resulted in an  acceptable  fit    χ2   9  = 41.546,  p  <  0.001,  NFI = 0.923,  CFI = 0.937,  RMSEA = 0.076 , although a previous model was a significantly better fit  chi-  square   7  = 39.966,  p < 0.001   and  the  addition  of  the  social  skills  variable    Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    71  increased  the  ratio  of  chi- square  to  degrees  of  freedom  above  the  recom- mended  level  of  3.  Depression  was  directly  related  to  deficient  social  skill    β = 0.20 , confirming Hypothesis 2, while self- reactive outcome expectations  preceded  preference  for  online  social  interaction    β = 0.15 ,  supporting  Hypothesis  3.  The  path  from  self- reactive  outcome  expectations  changed  slightly   β = 0.15 , but the remaining path coefficients and the overall variance  explained in negative consequences were unchanged. The modification indices  suggested a correlated error term between deficient social skills and deficient  self- reaction, but this modification was not necessary to produce an acceptable  fit.   In Table 3.1, one- way ANOVA with pre- planned contrasts was used to dis- tinguish social  messaging and social networking  activities from others  down- loading, gaming, and shopping .   Preference for online social interaction differed by activity  F 4,629  = 3.12,  p < 0.05 ; however, the planned contrast was not significant  t 29.6  = 0.956,  n.s.,  equal  variances  not  assumed   and  so  H4a  was  rejected.  Deficient  social  skills did not differ among activities  F 4,629  = 0.756, n.s.  so H4b was not  supported.  Negative  consequences  varied  across  favorites   F 4,629  = 19.06,  p < 0.001  and the planned contrast was significant  t 80.7  = –3.29 .

To  test  Hypothesis  6,  the  integrated  model  was  applied  to  four  favorite  activities and differences among path coefficients were examined  Tables 3.1  and 3.2 . Online shopping had too few cases to be included and the results for  gaming should be interpreted with caution for the same reason. There were  no significant differences among the paths linking deficient social skills to the  preference  for  online  social  interaction  to  deficient  self- reaction.  Therefore,  hypothesis 6 was disconfirmed.   In answer to RQ1, online gaming had the highest overall level of negative  consequences  Table 3.1  and also the highest levels of deficient self- regulation  and self- reactive outcome expectations.

Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    73  to  deficient  self- reaction,  and  from  self- reactive  outcomes  to  negative  con- sequences were not significant, so there was no evidence of a pattern of Inter- net use  in  the service of  mood management. A  case  could also be  made  for  downloading as the most problematic in that the latter two paths   β = 0.25,  β = 0.31,  and  β = 0.20  respectively,  all  p < 0.001   were  significant  even  though  the  levels  of  negative  consequences,  deficient  self- reaction,  and  self-  reactive  outcome  expectations  were  moderate  compared  to  other  activities.  The links between depression and self- reactive outcomes   β = 0.15, p < 0.05   and  between  self- reactive  outcomes  and  negative  consequences    β = 0.22,  p < 0.001  were significant for social networking, indicating its possible use for  mood adjustment and its potential for interfering with important life activities.  Also, the level of deficient self- reaction was higher for social networking than  for all other activities, save for online gaming, although still below the mid- point of the scales used. Moreover, the link between self- reactive outcomes  and  deficient  self- reaction  was  not  confirmed    β = 0.03,  n.s. ,  suggesting  a  behavior that is still under effective self- regulation.  Discussion  Prior  studies  of  Internet  habits,  whether  described  as  problematic   Caplan,  2005 ,  addictive   Young  &  Rogers,  1998 ,  or  unregulated   LaRose  et  al.,  2003   media  behaviors,  did  not  distinguish  among  different  types  of  online  activities. The current study asked the participants to focus on their favorite  online  activity;  in  order  of  popularity,  they  were  social  networking,  down- loading entertainment media files, messaging, gaming, and online shopping.   The  present  research  re- examined  the  structure  of  media  habits  within  socio- cognitive  theory  to  articulate  two  dimensions  associated  with  habitual  use, deficient self- observation, and deficient self- reaction. Incorporating these  concepts, LaRose et al.’s  2003  model of unregulated Internet use explained  negative  life  consequences.  In  this  model,  depression  preceded  self- reactive  outcome  expectations  and  deficient  self- reaction.  Deficient  self- reaction  and  self- reactive  outcome  expectations  both  predicted  deficient  self- observation  and  negative  life  consequences,  and  self- reactive  outcome  expectations  also  preceded  deficient  self- reaction.  Deficient  self- reaction,  an  indication  of  the  lack  of  intentionality  and  lack  of  controllability  of  media  habits,  emerged  as  the single most powerful predictor of negative life consequences.   A  second  dimension  of  media  habits,  deficient  self- observation,  also  pre- dicted negative life consequences, but the sign of the relationship was opposite  to the one expected. This might be interpreted to mean that, with repetition,  individuals become inattentive to their favorite online activity as control over  it gradually shifts from the cortex to  non- conscious  processes governed by    74    Context  the basal ganglia  Yin & Knowlton, 2006 . They are then perhaps less likely to  perceive that they “have a problem” by failing to recognize that their involve- ment  with  their  favorite  online  activity  has  impacted  their  school,  work,  or  social activities. This could be an act of denial or the result of lack of conscious  awareness  of  the  extent  of  their  involvement  in  their  favorite  pastime.  But  there is also the possibility that the causal relationship is in the opposite direc- tion  of  that  proposed  in  the  model;  that  is,  that  negative  life  consequences  cause individuals to become more attentive to their media consumption behav- ior, causing deficient self- observation to decrease. That would be an indication  of  a  moderating  process  through  which  effective  self- regulation  might  be  restored.  A  third  possibility  is  that  both  mechanisms  are  in  play,  with  the  former operative at relatively early stages of habit formation when individuals  are  merely  indulging  in  enjoyable  activities  and  the  latter  when  excessive  indulgence has severe consequences.   However, the latter mechanism is unlikely to have played a major role in  the current study since there were few, if any, “problematic” Internet users in  the sample, a statement that can also be made about previous research involv- ing student samples, including Caplan  2005  and LaRose et al.  2003 . In the  present  sample,  only  seven  individuals   four  of  whom  listed  gaming  as  their  favorite online activity  strongly agreed that they had suffered even one of the  three  negative  consequences  associated  with  their  favorite  activity  and  thus  might  be  said  to  be  experiencing  “severe”  life  consequences  required  for  a  diagnosis  of  a  mental  disease   Shaffer  et  al.,  2000 .  But  the  consequences   missing work or social activities or dropping a grade in a class  are perhaps in  themselves not dire enough to constitute a diagnosis of mental illness. Flunk- ing  out  of  school,  for  example,  might  be  such  a  consequence,  but  those  persons would not appear in the present sample of college students, nor in the  previously cited ones.   Thus,  what  emerges  is  a  model  of  habitual  Internet  activities  rather  than  problematic  ones.  However,  we  would  argue  along  with  LaRose  and  Eastin   2004   that  a  further  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  that  contribute  to  habitual media consumption make an important contribution. The process by  which media selections turn into favorite activities, whether or not they lead  to negative consequences, should be of interest both to media scholars and to  practitioners.   The social skill account fared less well than previously  Caplan, 2005 , and  did not produce an acceptable fit to the current data. The compulsive use vari- able of the social skill model, called deficient self- reaction here, was a consist- ent predictor of negative consequences across all activities. However, adding  two  variables  introduced  in  Caplan’s   2005   social  skill  model  of  PIU,  defi- cient social skill and preference for online social interaction, did not improve    Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    75  the overall model fit nor did they increase the variance explained in negative  life consequences compared to the socio- cognitive variables alone. Thus, the  effects of the unique social skill variables may be accounted for by the socio-  cognitive model. Moreover, Social Cognitive Theory offers an explanation for  a  connection  between  deficient  social  skill  and  deficient  self- reaction  that  would  be  necessary  to  fit  the  current  data:  Both  could  reflect  an  underlying  inability  to  regulate  one’s  behavior  effectively,  both  in  the  real- world  social  realm and in the online world.   At  the  time  of  Caplan’s   2005   work,  social  uses  of  the  Internet  did  not  include social networking websites  e.g., MySpace, Facebook . Since these are  now the dominant online activity among college students, it might be expected  that the social skill account would be more powerful than ever, but it did not  hold in the current study. Also, the social networking and messaging activities  that might be expected to be most amenable to the social skill explanation did  not differ from downloading or gaming with respect to the impact of deficient   real- world  social skill and preference for online social interaction. However,  it  might  be  argued  that  all  of  the  favorite  online  activities  examined  here  involve  extensive  social  interaction.  For  example,  multiplayer  online  games  like  World  of  Warcraft  typically  require  online  interactions  to  plan  group  activities,  such  as  raids  on  other  groups  of  players   Ducheneaut  &  Moore,  2004 .  File  sharers  interact  to  share  their  interests  in  entertainment  and  to  locate rare or good- quality files to download  LaRose & Kim, 2007 .   Among favorite online activities, there was little evidence that social net- working  services  were  especially  problematic  compared  to  other  favorite  online pursuits. Social networking, along with messaging, was associated with  a higher degree of deficient self- observation compared to other favorite online  activities, but it appeared that social networking behavior was still guided by  effective self- regulation.   Online  gaming  was  perhaps  the  most  problematic  since  it  was  associated  with the highest levels of negative consequences, deficient self- reaction, and  self- reactive outcome expectations. And, four of the seven most problematic  cases in the present sample were gamers. This confirmed recent findings that  online  gaming  is  one  of  the  most  likely  reasons  for  compulsive  Internet  use   Meerkerk,  Van  Den  Eijnden,  &  Garretsen,  2006 .  However,  there  were  three vital “missing links” in the path model for gaming, from depression to  self- reactive  outcome  expectations  and  then  to  deficient  self- reaction  and  negative consequences, that would indicate a pattern of “self- medication” with  online games as the “drug.” This pattern was not found among the gamers in  the present study.   To understand how favorites may change into problematic habits, consider  that Figure 3.1 represents but one iteration in what can become a recurring    76    Context  cycle.  Negative  consequences  lead  to  increased  dysphoria,  diminished  self-  regulation,  and  renewed  efforts  to  adjust  dysphoric  states  through  further  media use, leading to yet more negative consequences, and so on. Media con- sumption  could  become  a  classically  conditioned  response   i.e.,  a  habitual  reaction triggered by external stimuli such as the sight of one’s computer  to  dysphoric moods, resulting in a complete loss of self- control  i.e., highly defi- cient self- reaction , deepening the spiral until the individual “bottoms out” by  experiencing the loss of job, marriage, or home. Such cases would conform to  the etiology of addictive behavior  Marlatt et al., 1988 .   Individuals  might  also  exit  the  cycle  in  various  ways.  The  experience  of  negative life consequences could heighten awareness of the activity and restore  effective  self- observation  of  the   negative   outcomes  of  excessive  Internet  behavior. Conscious efforts to reduce excessive use, such as indulging feelings  of  guilt  or  self- administering  rewards  for  moderate  behavior,  would  restore  effective self- reaction and also re- direct attention to the behavior, further bol- stering  self- observation.  With  continual  repetition,  favorite  activities  might  also lose their ability to modify dysphoric moods.   The present results lend new credence to the “time inelasticity” argument   Nie,  2001   to  explain  the  negative  effects  of  the  Internet.  The  amount  of  usage  of  favorite  Internet  activities  was  directly  related  to  negative  con- sequences   r = 0.32,  p < 0.001 ,  suggesting  that  time  displacement  may  account, in part, for negative effects of the Internet. Efforts to explain away  such effects  e.g., Bargh & McKenna, 2004  may suffer from the same criti- cism that inspired the present research, that all Internet use is not the same.  The  positive  effects  of  some  types  of  Internet  use  may  offset  the  negative  effects  of  others  and  lead  to  misleading  conclusions  about  underlying  causal  mechanisms.   For example, messaging differed from other favorites in that it was the only  online activity for which there were significant paths from expected self- reactive  outcomes  to  preference  for  online  social  interaction  and  from  deficient  self-  observation  to  negative  consequences,  although  both  paths  were  significant  across all activities in the combined sample. Also, messaging was the only activ- ity for which the path from deficient social skill to preference for online inter- action, a key link in the social skills account, was not significant. Unlike social  networkers, among the messagers the paths from depression were not signific- ant, nor was the path from deficient social skill to preference for online social  interaction.  Thus,  the  social  skill  account  has  merit  for  social  networking  but  does not appear to account for online social interaction involving email and other  forms of messaging. Rather than responding to unsatisfying real- world interac- tions  by  seeking  new  relationships  online,  the  messagers  may  have  learned  to  expect instant messages will maintain satisfying existing relationships.   Addiction, Compulsion or Habit?    77  Limitations  The present results may not be generalized to other populations. The Internet  usage  patterns  of  college  students  might  be  unique,  both  with  regard  to  the  use  of  social  networking  applications  and  with  respect  to  the  prevalence  of  problematic  forms  of  use   Byun,  Celestino,  Mills,  Ajecia,  et  al.,  2009 .  Second,  some  of  the  more  problematic  applications  of  the  Internet,  such  as  online  gambling  and  pornography,  were  not  sufficiently  prevalent  in  the  current study to permit separate analyses. The negative consequences reported  by the sample were also at the low ends of their respective scales. At- risk pop- ulations should be targeted for future data collection. Finally, structural equa- tion  modeling  with  cross- sectional  data  can  only  test  assumptions  about  the  direction of causality, not establish them conclusively.  Implications for Further Research  The present model of media might be expanded to include the third submech- anism  of  self- regulation,  judgmental  process.  LaRose  and  Kim   2007   found  that holding behavior up to lax standards  e.g., the downloading behavior of  other college students  decreased perceptions that self- regulation was deficient  and thus might impair efforts to restore effective self- control.   Time- series studies should explore feedback loops in the current model; for  example, a connection from the experience of negative life consequences to  depression  has  not  been  explored  in  extant  time- series  research   Bessiere  et  al.,  2008 .  The  further  connection  between  depression  and  self- reactive  outcome expectations would in turn complete the “missing links” in a down- ward  spiral  through  which  media  use  mounts  to  offset  dysphoric  moods,  resulting  in  further  negative  consequences  as  the  media  compete  with  other  life activities, ending in a behavioral addiction  Marlatt et al., 1988 .   Reward sensitivity has been identified as a possible underlying cause of the  various types of disorders that have been identified with PIU Internet Addic- tion   Hollander,  2006 .  Reward  sensitivity  might  be  understood  in  socio-  cognitive terms as a causal linkage between self- reactive outcome expectations  for a favorite media activity and negative life outcomes. This concept should  be tested as a possible mediator of that relationship.  Summary  The present research redefined what had been called problematic, addictive,  or unregulated Internet behavior as habitual media consumption. Two com- peting  explanations  of  the  negative  consequences  of  Internet  use  were  compared and integrated into a model grounded in Social Cognitive Theory.    78    Context  The causal mechanisms underlying favorite activities were found to differ. As  the  Internet  absorbs  and  creates  more  forms  of  entertainment  and  interper- sonal  communication,  it  will  be  increasingly  important  to  draw  distinctions  among  online  activities.  However,  based  on  the  current  results,  social  net- working services appear to be no more problematic, addictive, or even habit- ual than others despite their widespread popularity and popular press accounts  of “Facebook addiction.”  Notes    1.

Chapter 4 Social Network Exploitation  Mark Andrejevic  Herein lies the perversity of social networks: however radical they may be, they  will always be data- mined. They are designed to be exploited.   Ippolita, Lovink, & Rossiter, 2009   The  commercial  models  that  are  rapidly  invading  and  colonizing  social  life  online are spilling over into the realm of the workplace proper—and not just  for the bored- at-work network. Consider, for example, a recent account of  the use of social networking sites like Facebook by job recruiters in the wake  of the global financial downturn. After several months of looking for a job, an  unemployed engineer profiled by the New York Times received a “Jobvite” from  a former co- worker who found him through an online recruiting application  that trawls sites like Facebook and LinkedIn. Such applications mark a shift in  employers’  use  of  social  networking  sites  from  surreptitious  screening  resources  to  recruiting  databases  and  utilities  for  viral  marketing.  To  avail  themselves  of  employee  social  networks,  companies  piggyback  applications  supplied  by  so- called  “software- as-service”  companies  like  Appirio  onto  the  social  networking  sites  of  employees.  Appirio’s  application,  for  example,  searches the networks and notifies employees “when new jobs open and which  of  their  friends  might  be  a  good  fit”   Weed,  2009 .  Aside  from  generating  practical  benefits  for  job  seekers  and  companies,  such  applications  extend  workplace monitoring into the online social lives of employees. In this regard,  the  workplace  is  catching  up  with  the  marketing  industry,  which  has  been  drawing on the power of interactivity to insert itself into realms of social prac- tice hitherto largely beyond the gaze of market researchers and to convert the  information  employees  generate  into  what  Vincent  Mosco   1989   has  described as “cybernetic commodities.”   If one of the characteristic developments of the interactive era has been the  de- differentiation of sites of labor, domesticity, social life, and consumption,    Social Network Exploitation    83  for some categories of workers, it is perhaps not surprising that the monitor- ing capacity of the workplace is reaching out into the realm of our increasingly  digitally mediated social lives. More concretely, if digital technology makes it  possible to work outside the office, recent innovations enable the workplace  to exploit the productivity of our social lives outside the workplace.   Much has been made of the ambivalent or hybrid status of user- generated  content  creation  as  a  site  of  both  intrinsic  reward  and  potential  exploitation   see, for example, Arvidsson, 2007; Terranova, 2000; Banks & Humphreys,  2008 . Thus, for example, Arvidsson argues that, “the post- Fordist production  process directly exploits the communitarian dimension of social life”  p. 241 .  By capturing and channeling user- generated activity for marketing purposes,  emerging forms of online commerce subsume the potential diversity of social  life to narrower commercial interests. One important dimension of exploita- tion, for Arvidsson, “consists in making the productive sociality of consumers  evolve  on  the  premises  of  brands;  to  make  it  unfold  through  branded  con- sumer goods in such ways that makes it produce measurable  and hence valu   able  forms of attention”  p. 251 . By contrast, Banks and Humphreys  2008   argue that online forms of co- creation complicate standard critiques of exploi- tation. Users clearly enjoy and benefit from online activities even as they gen- erate value for commercial websites. The result, they suggest, might be better  understood in terms of mutual benefit than exploitation:  Rather than being a zero sum game where if companies derive economic  benefit it negates social benefit to the users  and hence is couched in terms  of exploitation , is this instead an example of a new articulation of a coop- erative and non- zero sum game whereby different motivations and value  regimes co- exist?   pp. 412–413   We are left with a familiar back- and-forth: if people willingly submit to forms  of online monitoring, they must be getting something out of it. After all, they  have a choice of whether or not to use social networking sites and submit to  the forms of commercial monitoring such use entails.   This chapter argues that more work needs to be done to clarify the relation- ship  between  willing  participation  and  commercial  exploitation.  What  is  needed is an explanation of how a theory of exploitation might apply to the  conditions  under  which  user- generated  content  creates  value.  Rather  than  capitulating to the notion that notions of exploitation do not readily apply to  the changed conditions of production associated with the provision of “free” or  “immaterial” labor, this chapter provides a preliminary attempt to develop a  theory of exploitation for the era of commercial social networking.   84    Context    It is perhaps worth highlighting the workings of the corporate imagination  at play in the fields of social networking to make it clear just how these sites  are viewed as standing reserves of data for marketing purposes. For example,  a press release by Appirio outlines the triple value of employee social network- ing data as a resource for recruiting, sales, and marketing—all of this without  having to pay employees for providing the data. Appirio’s marketing applica- tion piggybacks on Facebook,  to increase the size of a company’s “virtual account team” by leveraging  relationships  that  employees  might  already  have  to  approach  strategic  accounts  or  build  customer  relationships. . . .  The  employee  can  see  if  a  friend has become a lead, bought a product, attended an event . . . etc. If  the employee chooses they can contact their friend through Facebook to  make  a  connection  and  ultimately  help  contribute  to  their  company’s  bottom line  and maybe even their own bonus! .  Market Wire, 2009—note that the only compensation for the employee’s  “voluntary” participation is a potential bonus!   But there is more: the same data that can provide leads for potential hires and  clients  serve  treble  duty  by  providing  data  for  targeted  marketing  appeals:  “Based on a search of keywords in friend profiles, the application makes rec- ommendations of friends who might be interested in the offer, which users can  then choose to take action on”  Market Wire, 2009 . The application links data  from the social networks of individual employees with a proprietary consumer  relationship  marketing  database  in  order  “to  track  leads,  make  follow- up  offers, and report on campaign success to see how their viral campaigns stack  up to other marketing programs”  Market Wire, 2009 .   It is not hard to imagine marketers slapping their foreheads as the proverbial  light bulb snaps on: all the work that the Internet generation has been doing to  assemble extended social networks of hundreds or even thousands of Facebook  “friends”  can  be  harnessed  not  just  by  Facebook,  but  also  by  employers.  The  scenario  outlined  by  Appirio  is  a  fascinating  if  disturbing  one:  potential  employees  with  large  online  social  networks  might  be  viewed  as  preferable  hires because of the resources for viral marketing they bring to their company.  Indeed, an extended social network might come to function not just as a form  of online social capital, but also as online economic capital: an information asset  that the digital worker must cultivate to be viable in the twenty- first-century  workforce. It is all too easy to envision the proliferation of self- help books that  provide  instruction  in  how  to  cultivate  extended  networks  of  “high- quality”  online  friends  in  order  to  maximize  one’s  potential  value  in  the  workplace.  Within  the  context  of  the  commercial  deployment  of  social  networking,  the    Social Network Exploitation    85  very notion of what constitutes a “quality” friendship becomes colonized by the  promise of economic return- on-investment. The dystopian scenario envisioned  by the capitalization of social networks is one of rationalized instrumentalism:  the permeation of social networks by the quantifying logic of exchange value. It  is a prospect foreshadowed by, for example, the title of an investment note on  social networking put out by Lehman Brothers: “How Much are Your Friends  Worth?”  the Independent, 2007 —and by the Facebook application “Friends for  Sale,” which invites participants to “Buy people and make them your pets! Make  money as a shrewd pet investor or as a hot commodity”  Facebook, 2009a .  The Logic of Separation  The plan outlined by Appirio  and other startups developing strategies for “mon- etizing”  the  tremendous  amounts  of  data  generated  by  commercial  social  net- working sites and, most recently, Twitter feeds , the details of employees’ social  lives along with the observations and opinions they share with one another are  treated  as  free  resources,  readily  available  to  employers  for  the  purposes  of  recruiting,  marketing,  and  sales.  The  cursory  qualification  by  Appirio  that  employees can supply access to their networks “if they so choose” comes across  as  an  empty  gesture:  what  choice  will  they  really  have?  Their  online  social  resources are treated as one more capacity of labor. Withholding such resources  might come to seem as strange as withholding other aspects of one’s labor: like  signing  up  for  a  job  and  then  refusing  to  devote  one’s  full  mental  or  physical  effort  to  the  assigned  tasks.  In  the  information  era,  members  of  the  digital  working class have something else to sell as part of their labor power: their social  networks, at least insofar as these are recorded and stored on commercial plat- forms like Facebook or otherwise available online.   As in the case of labor power, however, the “freely agreed upon” transac- tion that governs the use of this information will be shaped by existing power  relations  and  structures  of  ownership.  Or,  to  put  it  in  somewhat  different  terms,  submission  to  forms  of  commercial  surveillance  becomes  one  of  the  conditions  of  employment,  just  as  submission  to  monitoring  becomes,  over  time, a built- in condition of the wage–labor contract and, indeed, one of the  reasons for the development and structure of group workplaces. If one of the  expectations  of  wage–labor  is  the  willing  submission  to  workplace  surveil- lance, applications like Appirio’s entail normalizing the expansion of manage- ment’s  monitoring  gaze  to  encompass  not  just  workplace  activities,  but  also  the  structure  and  details  of  employees’  social  lives.  We  might  think  of  this  expansion  of  reach  as  the  contemporary  appropriation  of  newly  exploitable  productive  resources:  a  contemporary  process  of  virtual  enclosure  of  the  commons of social life.   86    Context    It is tempting to describe this act of appropriation as an act of expropria- tion—a  contemporary  form  of  “primitive  accumulation”  of  resources:  what  Hesmondhalgh  2008 , following David Harvey, has described in a slightly dif- ferent context as, “the commodification of culture as accumulation by dispos- session”  p. 107 . Such a formulation, however, does not quite do justice to  the type of appropriation envisioned by Appirio and similar applications, for  they do not deprive employees of the productive use, at least for certain pur- poses,  of  their  social  network  resources.  Social  networks  as  information  resources  are,  in  the  sense  described  by  economists,  “non- rival”  in  use:  employers can put them to work without depriving employees of them.   A more precise and accurate formulation is outlined by Massimo De Angelis   2001 , who describes the forms of ongoing “primitive” accumulation neces- sary  to  capitalism’s  reproduction  in  terms  of  separation.  The  exploitation  of  new markets, in other words, entails the separation of resources from those  who rely upon them. This process of separation facilitates the establishment of  property rights that structure or restructure the terms of access to productive  resources.  As  De  Angelis   2001   puts  it,  “the  characteristic  extra- economic  process of separation between people and means of production is a continuous  and  inherent  process  of  capitalist  production”   p.  4 .  Such  “extra- economic”  forms  of  separation  include  the  pre- market  establishment  of  property  rights  exemplified by the forcible seizure of assets, for example, or the structuring of  legal  regimes  that  assign  rights  to  new  forms  of  economic  resources.  When  drug companies claim patent rights over traditional medicines, they are engag- ing in an enclosure of the commons analogous to the seizure and privatization  of agricultural land. In both instances, the privatization process helps to secure  control over access to productive resources. In turn, the separation of produc- ers from the means of production contributes to the reproduction of ongoing  forms of separation. As Marx put it, “Once this separation is given, the produc- tion process can only produce it anew, reproduce it, and reproduce it on an  expanded scale”  2009, p. 6 . Thus, land enclosure, for example, undergirds  the alienation of workers from control over their own labor, which must be  sold in exchange for access to the means of production.   To  describe  the  appropriation  of  information  resources  produced  by  the  social networking activity of employees in terms of separation is to interrogate  the conditions whereby this information is made accessible to and productive  for  employers.  The  rise  of  online  social  networking  as  a  commercially  sup- ported  phenomenon  combines  new  conveniences  and  affordances   access  to  email and social networking utilities, for example  with new forms of separa- tion.  To  the  extent  that  networked  forms  of  sociability  rely  on  privately  owned and operated infrastructures like Facebook, they represent the separa- tion  of  users  from  the  means  for  producing  online  sociability.  Those  who    Social Network Exploitation    87  control the means of online sociability thus have the power to set the terms of  access  to  these  resources.  These  terms  include  the  establishment  of  certain  rights over the information provided by users—rights that tend to be outlined  in  cursory,  often  incomprehensible  and  qualified  fashion.  Separation   the  private  control  over  online  resources  for  sociability   begets  separation   the  establishment of certain rights of use over information generated by users .   Thus, the various “terms of use” and end- user license agreements posted  by social networking sites are, in large part, constructed around the goal of  asserting  rights  over  the  use,  sale,  and  transfer  of  information  collected  online.  Facebook’s  terms  of  use  are  explicit  in  this  regard,  stipulating  that  users  provide  the  company  with  the  right  “to  use,  copy,  publicly  perform,  publicly  display,  reformat,  translate,  excerpt  . . .  and  distribute  such  User  Content for any purpose, commercial, advertising, or otherwise . . .”  Face- book,  2009c .  The  sweeping  and  often  vague  terms  of  these  agreements,  coupled with the stipulation that the terms of use may change at any point in  time  drives  home  the  point  that  the  companies  regard  this  information  as  theirs to do with as they see fit. In its privacy policy, Facebook makes a dis- tinction  between  two  types  of  information  provided  by  users:  “personal  information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Web  Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Web Site [and  other  sites,  as  stipulated  later  in  the  policy],”  but  it  seems  apparent  that  it  views  both  categories  as  proprietary  information  when  used  for  marketing  purposes   Facebook,  2009d .  The  site,  for  example,  asserts  the  right  to  “collect  information  about  you  from  other  sources,  such  as  newspapers,  blogs,  instant  messaging  services,  and  other  users  of  the  Facebook  service  through the operation of the service . . .”  2009d . The other social network- ing giant, MySpace, offers more opt- out options and a more fully articulated  privacy  policy,  but  nevertheless  establishes  its  rights  over  user- generated  information for a broad range of marketing purposes. Thus, it stipulates that  it has the right to collect “other Related Data and non- PII [Personally Identifi- able  Information]  including  IP  address,  aggregate  user  data,  and  browser  type. This data is used to manage and improve the MySpace Services, track  usage, and for security purposes”  MySpace, 2008 .   The combination of apparently rigorous and detailed privacy controls with  vague  and  open- ended  loopholes  recurs  further  down  in  MySpace’s  policy:  “Profile Information you provide in structured profile fields or questions . . .,  information you add to open- ended profile fields and questions . . . and other  non- PII and Related Data about you may also be used to customize the online  ads you encounter”  MySpace, 2008 . As if these terms do not make it clear  enough, the privacy policy stipulates that it counts this information among the  economic assets it can sell at will:   88    Context  if MySpace sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all  or a material part of its assets . . . MySpace may transfer your PII [and, it  seems fair to assume, all “Related Data”] to the party or parties involved  in the transaction.   MySpace, 2008   The  information  generated  by  consumers  who  are  presumably  compensated  through access to the site comprises a major part of the assets of the site.   The  fact  that  online  sociability  is  facilitated  by  separating  users  from  the  means  of  socializing  and  thereby  creating  an  external,  storable,  and  sortable  collection of data about their social lives, renders the product of their online  activity further alienable. Not only can Facebook use it, for example, to design  and implement customized marketing campaigns, but the data can be put to  use by the growing range of applications that piggy- back on the Facebook plat- form. In this case, the term “separation” refers to the fact that a digital inter- mediary  is  interposed  into  relations  of  sociability.  That  is  to  say,  forms  of  socializing  that  once  relied  upon  other  resources,  as  well  as  new  forms  of  sociability,  are  increasingly  dependent  upon  an  infrastructure  provided  by  a  third  party.  When  we  are  “separated”  from  the  means  of  socialization,  this  does not mean we do not have access to them; rather, we come to rely upon  technologies for socialization that separate us from the information upon which  our social lives rely. Crucial resources for sociability are no longer in our own  hands  at least to the extent that they once were , but are separated from us  and  stored  in  servers  owned  and  controlled  by,  for  example,  Facebook.  Imagine how much of the data upon which current social interactions rely  at  least for some groups  would be lost if Facebook were to disappear: millions  of photos, posts, messages, pokes, links, and so on would be wiped away: an  entire  archive  upon  which  a  wide  range  of  social  connections  relied.  Many  people would lose one of their primary modes of communication with certain  “friends.” We do not have to go far to figure out why people are so willing to  use  such  sites:  they  provide  a  ready,  convenient,  and  entertaining  way  of  enriching,  extending,  and  preserving  our  connections  with  others.  What  requires a bit more explanation is how we might discern, in a voluntary and  rewarding activity, the traces of exploitation.   The result of the form of separation facilitated by Facebook is not the dis- possession of users, but rather the alienability of the product of their online  social  activity:  the  fact  that  the  fruits  of  this  activity  can  become  a  resource  whose  uses  range  far  beyond  their  control.  Companies  like  Appirio  seek  to  exploit  this  productivity  when  they  develop  applications  that  put  the  social  resources  of  employees  to  work  in  ways  that  exceed  the  knowledge  and  control of those who created them. We might then note the parallels between    Social Network Exploitation    89  the  productive  capacity  of  the  work  of  online  social  networking  and  that  of  workplace labor: both rely for their exercise upon privately owned and con- trolled  infrastructures   in  the  case  of  social  networking  sites,  we  might  call  these  the  means  for  the  production  of  sociability .  In  both  cases,  access  to  these  resources  entails  surrendering  control  over  the  product  of  collective  activity to those who own the resources. It is important also to stress the dif- ferences  between  the  two  forms  of  value  production.  In  the  case  of  online  social networks, control over the productive activity itself  as opposed to some  of the product of this activity  is not  yet?  surrendered to those who own the  means of sociability. That is to say, neither Facebook nor employers who avail  themselves  of  applications  like  Appirio  claim  the  right  to  dictate  what  employees do in their online social networks. In the case of Appirio, however,  it is not hard to imagine how the imperatives of employers might come to col- onize or shape social networking activities, especially if compensation is tied  to the value they generate.   Another  crucial  difference  between  the  productivity  of  online  social  net- working and that of workplace labor is that the appropriation of products func- tions  differently:  employees  do  not  lose  their  social  networks  just  because  their employers put the data they generate to work. Finally, unlike workplace  labor, social networking is not directly tied to one’s livelihood. Significantly,  however,  the  scenario  envisioned  by  Appirio  directly  links  the  two:  one’s  social  network  becomes  analogous  in  important  respects  to  one’s  laboring  capacities. That is to say, it becomes a productive resource, like one’s educa- tion, skill set, training, and so on, that employers gain control over in order to  generate value.  Exploiting Free Labor  Because activities like online social networking have the capacity to generate  value, they fit into the broader categories of what has been described as “affec- tive”  and  “immaterial”  labor:  not  the  manufacture  of  material  products,  but  rather  the  production  of  networks  of  sociability,  taste,  and  communication.  Lazzarato describes immaterial labor as the “activity that produces the ‘cultural  content’ of the commodity,” noting that it “involves a series of activities that  are not normally recognized as ‘work’—in other words, the kinds of activities  involved in defining and fixing cultural and artistic standards, fashions, tastes,  consumer  norms,  and,  more  strategically,  public  opinion”   1996,  p.  137 .  Such  labor  corresponds  to  what  Michael  Hardt   also  following  Lazzarato   describes  as  an  “affective”  form  of  immaterial  labor:  “the  production  and  manipulation of affects,” which “requires  virtual or actual  human contact and  proximity”  1999, p. 93 .   90    Context    In each case, the form of labor in question tends to be “free”: both unpaid   outside of established labor markets  and freely given, endowed with a sense  of autonomy. The free and spontaneous production of community, sociality,  and shared contexts and understandings remains both autonomous in principle  from capital and captured in practice by it. As Hardt  1999  puts it, “in those  networks of culture and communication, collective subjectivities are produced  and  sociality  is  produced—even  if  those  subjectivities  and  that  sociality  are  directly  exploitable  by  capital”   p.  93 .  In  her  discussion  of  the  “free  labor”  provided by chat- room moderators in exchange for access to online services,  Terranova   2000   suggests  that  such  productive  activities  can,  in  some  con- texts, be described as both voluntary and subject to exploitation: “Free labor is  the  moment  where  this  knowledgeable  consumption  of  culture  is  translated  into productive activities that are pleasurably embraced and at the same time  often shamelessly exploited”  p. 37 .   There is nothing particularly new about the fact that individual consumers  add value to cultural and material products. Why then describe such forms of  work  a term which can be used to designate any activity that requires expend- iture of effort  as labor  work that generates value ? Precisely because of the  ways in which commercial digital media capture the details of activity that once  eluded  systematic  forms  of  value  extraction  in  order  to  turn  them  into  information commodities. Writing before the explosive growth of commercial  social  networking  sites,  Terranova   2000   draws  on  the  work  of  the  Italian  autonomists  to  describe  this  process  as  the  creation  of  a  “social  factory,”  wherein,  “work  processes  have  shifted  from  the  factory  to  society,  thereby  setting  in  motion  a  truly  complex  machine”   p.  36 .  Certainly  not  all  work  practices have migrated out of the factory—but the term captures the way in  which the productive capacity of the “factory” has extended out into society at  large. The social factory puts our pleasures, our communications, our sociabil- ity to work, capturing them in order to extract value from them. Terranova  describes such forms of online labor as “Simultaneously voluntarily given and  unwaged, enjoyed and exploited”  p. 36 .   If  we  concede  that  activity  which  generates  value  for  others  can  be  described as labor, it is yet another step to make the case regarding why, as  such, it might also be considered a form of exploitation. After all, the standard  critique of exploitation relies on an account of coercion—even if this coercion  is  embedded  in  the  social  relations  that  structure  the  “freely”  agreed  upon  labor contract. If, with Hardt  1999  and Terranova  2000 , we are going to  assert  that  the  potential  exists  for  the  exploitation  of  so- called  immaterial  or  free labor, we face the necessity of coming up with an understanding of the  term  that  is  adequate  to  the  work  being  performed  and  the  value  extracted  from  it.  In  the  face  of  contemporary  critiques  of  attempts  to  mobilize  the    Social Network Exploitation    91  notion of exploitation, perhaps the first task is to define what exploitation is  not. The mere fact that someone benefits from the efforts of another does not,  in  itself,  constitute  exploitation.  In  an  online  context,  for  example,  the  fact  that others may benefit by having access to an open- source program or to the  product of the collective contributions of others cannot be construed as prima-  facie  evidence  of  exploitation.  The  shared  benefits  of  collaboration  and  the  non- market benefits that economists describe as externalities are not indicators  of exploitation.   Exploitation is also not definable solely in terms of subjective sensibility: it  is  not  reducible  to  whether  or  not  individuals  feel  they  are  the  victims  of  exploitation. Such feelings may indeed be accurate, and yet they do not define  exploitation. That is to say, exploitation may exist in the absence of a subject- ive sense of victimization. Moreover, this assertion relies not upon the resusci- tation  of  notions  of  false  consciousness,  but  rather  upon  a  conception  of  alienation which, according to Holmstrom  1997 , lies at the heart of a critical  account of exploitation. For Marx, Holmstrom observes, the appropriation of  control  over  workers’  labor  represents  more  than  a  means  for  capturing  surplus value: it simultaneously reproduces the alienation of workers from the  product of their labor: “Being congealed labor, the product is in some sense  part  of  the  producers.  When  it  is  taken  away  from  them,  they  are  thereby  diminished,  impoverished,  denuded”   1997,  p.  85 .  It  is  a  formulation  that  draws  not  from  the  description  of  exploitation  in  Das  Kapital,  but  from  the  1844  manuscripts,  where  Marx   2009   forcefully  elaborates  the  wages  of  estranged labor:  The worker places his life in the object; but now it no longer belongs to  him, but to the object. [. . .] What the product of his labor is, he is not.  Therefore, the greater this product, the less is he himself.   p. 27     It is worth recalling this overtly humanist formulation if only to note how  neatly it anticipates the promises of the interactive economy: to return control  to producers of their creative activity  that is, to overcome their estrangement  from the product of their efforts , to build community  to overcome estrange- ment from others , and to facilitate our own self- understanding  to overcome  estrangement from themselves . If anyone is directly invoking the language of  Marx in the current conjuncture, it is not the critical theorists, but the com- mercial promoters of the interactive revolution. In this regard, we might enlist  Holmstrom’s formulation to turn the promise of digital empowerment back  on itself by exploring the ways in which it fails to overcome the very forms of  alienation it promised to remedy.   92    Context    The promise of interactive participation takes shape against the background  of the very alienation that was the object of Marx’s critique. One of the pre- conditions for the promotion of Web 2.0 is thus the invocation of the forms of  estrangement  associated  with  the  exploitation  of  waged  labor.  It  is  perhaps  telling  that  even  on  the  right  of  the  political  spectrum,  Marx  is  invoked  to  promote  the  ostensibly  revolutionary  power  of  the  Internet.  Conservative  blogger Andrew Sullivan  2002 , for example, once claimed that one of the  most important things blogs do “is—to invoke Marx—seize the means of pro- duction. It’s hard to underestimate what a huge deal this is.” In a similar vein,  Futurist William Wriston triumphantly proclaimed that “the force of microe- lectronics  will  blow  apart  all  monopolies  hierarchies,  pyramids,  and  power  grids of established industrial society”  as quoted in Barney, 2000, p. 19 .   Direct references to Marx do not make it into the corporate promotional  literature,  but  promises  to  overcome  alienation,  revitalize  community,  and  empower citizen- consumers are recurring themes. Thus, for example, Face- book’s company overview simply states: “Facebook’s mission is to give people  the power to share and make the world more open and connected”  Facebook,  2009b . Likewise, YouTube is “empowering” users “to become the broadcast- ers of tomorrow”  YouTube, 2009 . The promise, in other words, is to over- come the separation that lies at the core of capitalist alienation—the separation  enacted by private control over productive resources that compels workers to  surrender  control  over  their  own  activity.  The  commercial  digital  solution  borrows  from  the  familiar  spear- that-heals- the-wound- it-caused  logic  of  advertising: separation can be remedied by further separation.   According to such an account, community and creativity can be fostered by  commercial sites that store our data—everything from the details of our social  networks to our shared musings, pictures, videos, and music. These can be cir- culated  so  easily  because  they  are  separated  from  us,  stored  and  distributed   increasingly  on commercially owned and operated servers and networks, and  administered by commercial applications. The conditions of access to this infra- structure for social networking and communication include submission to forms  of  surveillance,  data- mining,  and  target  marketing  that  support  the  emerging  logic of online commerce: data- driven mass customization and target marketing.   According to the standard market account, the logic at work here is analo- gous  to  that  of  free  exchange.  Sites  like  Facebook  and  Gmail  provide  users  with a service, and in exchange they extract some form of payment. Just as  there is a “cost” associated with free- to-air TV, namely submission to market- ing  appeals,  so  too  there  is  a  cost  associated  with  the  services  provided  by  commercial Internet services: submission to monitoring and targeted advert- ising. If, on this account, the logic of free exchange underlies e- commerce—if  we willingly submit to the conditions set by commercial websites—then the    Social Network Exploitation    93  common- sense notion of exploitation is no longer in play; exploitation entails  coercion. The contribution of critical political economy is to discern the ways  in which relations of power and hence forms of coercion structure the terms  of so- called free exchange. Such a critique is crucial to any analysis of exploita- tion  within  the  context  of  so- called  “free”  labor.  The  coercion  inherent  in  “free” submission to the forms of monitoring, control, and payment associated  with wage labor contracts is relatively straightforward: control over produc- tive  resources  provides  owners  with  disproportionate  power  in  setting  the  terms of access to them  especially in conditions when there is a surplus labor  force .  If  they  are  to  provide  for  themselves,  those  with  nothing  to  sell  but  their labor power must do so under terms structured by unequal power rela- tions. In the case of social networking, the situation is different: access to the  privately owned means of sociality is not  yet?  inseparable from the ability to  earn a livelihood. For the most part, people aren’t earning their living by using  such  resources,  so  they  can  go  without  them  and  still  survive   though  one  might  assume  differently  to  hear  some  users  describe  how  reliant  they  have  become on their Facebook pages or their mobile phones .   The standard Marxist critique of exploitation combines the humanist con- cerns  outlined  above  with  an  economic  critique.  The  extraction  of  surplus  value is based on the labor commodity—whose value in use differs from its  value in exchange. Viewed within the context of market relations, workers are  not underpaid for labor qua commodity  this is central to Marx’s account of  exploitation  in  Volume  I  of  Capital .  In  the  wage–labor  exchange,  labor  receives  its  accurate  market  price:  the   historically  determined   cost  of  its  replacement. However, because its value in use exceeds its exchange value— because  labor  produces  value—its  economic  worth  to  those  who  own  and  control it is greater than its market price. Absent coercion, it would be prefer- able to control such power rather than to sell it. This account lines up with the  Marxist  account  of  alienation  outlined  by  Holmstrom   1997 —one  that  equates the loss of control over creative activity and collective productive life  with a loss of freedom. At the heart of both accounts is the ability to retain  control over one’s creative activity. As Marx puts it in the 1844 Manuscripts:  Man  makes  his  life  activity  itself  an  object  of  his  will  and  conscious- ness. . . . Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour  reverses the relationship so that man, just because he is a conscious being,  makes his life activity, his essential being, a mere means for his existence.   2009   Exploitation does not merely deprive the individual of the full value realized  from  his  or  her  creative  activity,  but  crucially  of  the  freedom  to  make  this    94    Context  activity  an  object  of  will  and  consciousness.  Estrangement  occurs  when  our  own activity appears as something turned back against us as “an alien power”  over and against oneself  Marx, 2009 .   With this somewhat richer conception of exploitation, we might develop a  set of criteria for discerning its relevance to “free” online labor. First, exploita- tion entails some form of coercion—even if this lurks only in the background  conditions that structure “free” exchange. Second, exploitation obtains when  there  is  loss  of  control  over  one’s  creative,  productive  activity—a  loss  that  results in the re- appearance of one’s own activity in the form of an alien force  turned back upon oneself.   Drawing  on  this  definition  of  exploitation,  we  can  revisit  the  example  of  Appirio’s  workplace  application.  Online  social  networking  apparently  fits  neatly into the category of those freely given activities exercised under neither  the  compulsion  of  necessity  nor  the  threat  of  force.  It  is  worth  noting,  however, that social networking takes place against the background of forms  of estrangement associated with industrial capitalism—the very alienation for  which new media promise an antidote, according to the marketing hype. Thus,  the  offer  of  a  modicum  of  control  over  productive  resources  as  well  as  the  promise to resuscitate extended forms of community and to challenge central- ized  control  over  collective  representations  all  gain  their  appeal  against  the  background  of  the  depredations  of  industrial  capitalism.  Viewed  in  this  context,  the  exchange  that  characterizes  interactive  sites   willing  submission  to  monitoring  and  advertising  in  exchange  for  access  to  communication  resources  might be understood as a second- order result of capitalist appropri- ation.  The  promise  is  that,  thanks  to  interactive  technology,  workers  can  regain some of the control over their own activity that is surrendered in the  wage–labor  contract.  Individuals  are  offered  a  modicum  of  control  over  the  product of their creative activity in exchange for the work they do in building  up  online  community  and  sociality  upon  privately  controlled  network  infra- structures. Their free participation is redoubled as a form of productive labor  captured by capital. In a self- generating cycle, the offer to overcome estrange- ment or alienation produces a second- order form of separation: that of users  from the data they generate.   The case of Appirio makes the analogy to the workplace more direct. The  request by employers to piggyback market research applications onto the social  networks built by employees takes place within the power relations that struc- ture submission to workplace conditions more generally. In this instance the  appeal  to  old- school,  retro- Marxist  accounts  of  workplace  exploitation  remains  relevant.  Workers  submit  to  the  forms  of  monitoring  and  control  exerted by employers precisely because the alternative is to lose their jobs. In  the case of Appirio, the same power relations that govern the appropriation of    Social Network Exploitation    95  control over labor are brought to bear upon “autonomous” forms of activity  like the creation and maintenance of online social networks.   However, the capture and use of social network information does not entail  the capture of control over the productive activity of employees: they are not   yet?   being  told  how  to  conduct  this  activity,  merely  to  make  the  results   available for marketing purposes. We might then argue that even if conditions  of  coercion  exist   “accept  Appirio’s  application  or  face  workplace  con- sequences” ,  estrangement  does  not.  Such  is  the  standard  rejoinder  to  the  charge of exploitation in the context of sites like Facebook: people continue to  enjoy the benefits of online social networking so why shouldn’t Facebook and  the applications it runs on its platform benefit as well, since their profits do  not detract from the benefits that accrue to users?   But  the  appropriation  of  social  networking  activity,  Appirio- style,  may  result  in  estrangement  after  all,  not  least  if  it  becomes  an  expected  part  of  what might be described as extra- workplace labor, something to be done on  one’s  own  time  for  the  sake  of  building  connections  and  collecting  data  for  employers. Direct control in the form of explicit orders regarding what to do  online can be replaced by indirect forms of governance in the name of maxi- mizing one’s marketable assets. Once social networks become part of a work- er’s  assets  to  employers,  they  are  subject  to  indirect  forms  of  governance:  maximize  the  productivity  of  one’s  network  for  the  company  or  face  work- place consequences.   A further test of exploitation is whether a form of appropriation results in  the return of the fruit of one’s own labor in the form of an alien force: the  fact that one’s own online social network activity will—in the scenario envi- sioned by Appirio and other applications—return in the form of an ongoing  barrage  of  custom- tailored  marketing  appeals  and  strategies  to  influence  behavior. Although built from the raw material of our own productive activ- ity  and  the  myriad  forms  of  experimentation  and  data- mining  exercised  upon  it  by  marketers,  this  activity  will  return  to  us  in  ways  that  make  it   difficult  to  discern  the  traces  of  our  own  contributions.  The  promise  of  interactivity,  channeled  through  commercial  websites,  is  to  enlist  the   participatory  public  in  the  process  of  marketing  to  itself.  The  resulting  opacity  of  representation—the  inability  to  trace  our  own  contributions  in  the  forms  of  cultural  suasion  visited  upon  us  by  dint  of  our  own  activity  recapitulates  the  estrangement  that  the  digital  “revolution”  promised  to  overcome.  The  world  envisioned  by  the  operators  of  the  data- mine,  the  owners of the databases, and the developers of marketing algorithms is one  in  which  ever  greater  participation  by  the  public  will  be  transformed  into  increasingly exclusive forms of proprietary knowledge, available to the few  for use upon the many.   96    Context  Conclusion  Appirio is just one example of emerging attempts to put the activity of online  social networking to work. Because it is a workplace application, one whose  use  is  requested  by  employers,  it  brings  into  play  the  power  relations  that  structure “free” submission to workplace requirements. But what about other  uses of user- generated data—such as that of Facebook in the absence of Appir- io’s applications? Is it possible to discern the workings of exploitation without  the coercion associated with workplace social relations? There is no external  compulsion to use Facebook or other similar applications—such decisions are  generally portrayed as a matter of choice, convenience, and personal pleasure.  However,  conditions  of  estrangement  may  still  obtain  since  the  commercial  character of online social networking sites means that users will still be subject  to  detailed  forms  of  data- gathering  and  ongoing  controlled  experiments  in  target marketing designed to more effectively influence their behavior without  their  knowledge.  Their  own  activities  will  be  turned  back  upon  them  in  complex and opaque forms with the express purpose of channeling and direct- ing their behavior.   In signing up to use such services, however, users arguably knowingly agree  to submit to such forms of monitoring and manipulation and there is no law  that  says  they  have  to  join  sites  like  Facebook  or  MySpace.  Set  aside  for  the  moment the fact that by all accounts only a tiny fraction of users both read and  understand the terms of use to which they ostensibly agree. Set aside even the  fact that the terms themselves—subject to change at any time without notice— can hardly serve as the basis for either “fully informed” consent or enforceable  claims on behalf of users. What would it mean to take seriously the notion that  access to online communities facilitated by social networking sites comprised a  productive  resource  in  the  emerging  information  economy?  That  is  to  say,  what if we were to describe such sites not just as consumer services or enter- taining novelties for the informated class, but as crucial information resources  in  the  network  era?  This  is  a  perspective  that  some  of  the  more  digitally  advanced  companies  in  the  information  economy  are  starting  to  embrace— one in which social networking sites serve, as one employer put it, as “a funda- mental  communication  tool  to  probably  more  than  half  our  workforce”   Moscaritolo,  2007 .  If  this  sounds  absurd,  a  similar  historical  progression  took  place  in  the  use  of  email,  a  popular  communication- enhancing  novelty  that  developed  into  an  indispensable  communication  tool  for  a  range  of  workers in the information- age workplace. It is not hard to imagine a world in  which  those  who  eschew  networking  sites  will  seem  as  outdated,  hard- to- reach, and perhaps overly protective of their privacy as those who don’t have  an email account or carry mobile phones. In the social factory, the boundaries    Social Network Exploitation    97  between  spheres  of  labor  and  leisure,  domesticity,  and  consumption  upon  which the distinction between consumer choice and workplace coercion relies,  become  blurred.  To  the  extent  that  our  communicative,  educational,  and  social lives are folded into the social factory and become the resources that we  draw upon and sell to employers, access to resources for online networking  becomes a crucial component of generating value.   One  of  the  constitutive  half- truths  about  the  character  of  immaterial  or  affective  labor  in  the  digital  era  is  that,  as  Banks  and  Humphreys   2008 ,  echoing  Sullivan   2002   and  De  Kerckhove   in  Barney,  2000   put  it,  “the  means of knowledge and cultural production are now in the hands of the con- sumers”  p. 406 . The formulation blurs the important line between access to  the  means  of  online  content  production  and  ownership  or  control  over  these  resources.  Consumers  may  own  computers  and  software,  but  not  the  net- works and vast server farms that make possible the creation and maintenance  of  online  social  networks  and  the  forms  of  content  sharing  that  characterize  the emerging online economy.   Thus, any comparison of industrial- era production to information- age crea- tivity needs to take into account not just the fact that productive resources are  in the hands of consumers, but also that the means of communication and dis- tribution  are  not.  That  the  privatization  of  network  infrastructures  and  the  commercialization  of  online  applications  lies  at  the  core  of  emerging  online  business models is obscured by a narrow focus on user- generated content.   This chapter’s premise is that the new forms of communication, transaction,  consumption, and interaction made possible by digital technologies need to be sit- uated within their larger economic context, namely, the creation of a privately  owned and operated commercial media structure. When we explore what people  do on Facebook or MySpace and the forms of community such sites enable, we  must also keep in mind what gets done with the products of this activity, who  controls its use and re- use, who profits from its transformation into commercial  commodities and marketing campaigns, as well as who is targeted by these cam- paigns and to what end. Contrary to conventional wisdom, social networking sites  don’t publicize community, they privatize it. Commercial social networking sites  are  ostensibly  collaborative  productions,  except  when  it  comes  to  structuring  terms- of-use agreements, and, of course, allocating the profits they generate.   This is not to discount the real forms of satisfaction and communion that  users get out of participating in such sites—rather, it is to situate these within  the  larger  economic  context  whereby  value- generating  activity  is  exchanged  according  to  terms  structured  by  those  who  own  and  operate  the  means  of  their production. The fact that third parties may benefit from the collection  and use of our personal information does not in itself constitute exploitation,  at least according to the definition proposed by this chapter. Nor does the fact    98    Context  that we may enjoy and benefit from our social networking practices exempt  such activities from being subject to exploitation, any more than the fact that  some forms of wage labor may be enjoyable and rewarding. The capture and  use  of  user- generated  information  for  commercial  purposes—its  reconstitu- tion  in  forms  of  suasion,  manipulation,  and  control  turned  back  upon  those  who created it—recapitulates the logic of separation and estrangement.   In the broadest sense, the promise of access to sites of online creativity and  sociability  takes  place  against  a  background  already  structured  by  separation   of the great majority of individuals from control over productive resources   and  resulting  forms  of  estrangement.  Moreover,  as  the  example  of  Appirio  suggests,  as  interactive  technologies  facilitate  forms  of  extra- workplace  pro- ductivity, workplace relations help determine the capture and “monetization”  of this activity. The case of Appirio represents the more general logic behind  attempts  to  piggyback  on  commercial  forms  of  social  networking.  Facebook  markets itself as a platform for a broad range of applications designed to capi- talize on the information generated by its members.   Consider, for example, the use of add- on applications  one of which is sug- gestively named Encompass  by universities to build alumni networks for mar- keting and fundraising. As one press release put it:  When looking to engage young alumni, you have to become part of their  conversation, and many of those interactions start on Facebook. . . . Using  Facebook  Connect,  Encompass  just  became  more  social  by  allowing  member activity, like an event RSVP or a donation, to be published on  members’  Facebook  News  Feeds. . . .  Facebook  Connect  is  what  our  market needs to achieve their development and advancement goals.   Science Letter, 2008   Perhaps  access  to  educational  resources  will  one  day  be  conditional  upon  sharing information about  and via  one’s social networks.   In the end, theoretical approaches to commercial social networking applica- tions that treat them as a site of free choice paradoxically recapitulate the distinc- tion  between  production  and  consumption  they  profess  to  undermine.  If,  indeed, such sites are productive ones, if they erode the distinction between con- sumer and producer, audience and author, user and creator, then they become  amenable to critiques of the conditions that structure access to the means of pro- ductive resources. The lens of consumer choice then becomes a flawed one for  examining the workings of social networking. It ignores the productive aspect of  such sites and thus overlooks both the value- generating work done by consumers  and the logic of enclosure whereby this value is captured. Second, it naturalizes  the process whereby private ownership of productive resources structures the    Social Network Exploitation    99  terms  of  exchange  whereby  users  exchange  their  value- generating  activity  for  access  to  resources  for  communication,  information  sharing,  and  sociability.  Third, it backgrounds the forms of coercion that may contribute to willing sub- mission to detailed forms of monitoring. Finally, it concedes that, in the informa- tion  age,  our  communal  life  will  be  permeated  by  comprehensive  monitoring  and tightly targeted advertising while assuming that the natural form community  takes in the digital era is one based on privately owned resources. It should be  possible, by contrast, to envision forms of online community and sociability that  do not entail submission to increasingly detailed forms of monitoring and soph- isticated target marketing.   Social  networking  needn’t  be  constituted  as  a  commercially  supported  activity.  Indeed,  the  sites  lend  themselves  to  the  collaborative  peer- to-peer  logic described by Bauwens  2009 , in which use value is produced directly,  through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed  capital. . . . Its product is not exchange value for a market, but use- value  for a community of users  for example in the sharing of film and music . It  is governed by the community of producers  and users  themselves, and  not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy.  There  is  a  longstanding  history  of  groups  creating  not- for-profit  modes  of  sociality  in  a  range  of  spaces  and  contexts,  and,  as  Facebook  itself  demon- strates, people are willing to contribute the necessary work in exchange for  the non- monetary and collective benefits they receive. Nor is it the case that  users are unwilling or unable to pay the cost of supporting online social net- works—indirectly  they  already  do  so  in  the  form  of  the  advertising  costs  passed on to them in the purchase price of the products they consume. Such  costs would likely be much lower if they were directly incorporated into user  fees for a not- for-profit online infrastructure. The Internet didn’t start as a pri- vately  owned  and  commercially  operated  communication  system,  and  it  needn’t  remain  so.  However,  it  is  perhaps  a  symptom  of  the  triumph  of  market logic that it sounds outlandish even to suggest the possibility of a non-  commercial Internet—as if it had always been primarily a privately owned and  commercially  operated  system.  Perhaps  one  way  to  trouble  the  seemingly  intractable assumption of the naturally commercial basis of new forms of socia- bility is to highlight alternative forms of production, as Bauwens does, and to  highlight the exploitative character of online commerce. The reduction of our  notion of community to one structured by marketing interests and built upon  the exploitation of user labour represents not a limitation of the technology,  but  of  our  conception  of  community  and  our  grasp  of  the  potential  of  net- worked interactivity.   100    Context  References  401–418.

Part II  Social Textures Emerging Patterns of Sociability  on Social Network Sites    Chapter 5 Social Network Sites as Virtual  Communities  Malcolm R. Parks  Virtual  communities  are  social  aggregations  that  emerge  from  the  Net  when  enough people carry on . . . public discussions long enough, with sufficient human  feeling, to form webs of personal relationships in cyberspace.   Rheingold, 1993, p. 5   In 1993, Howard Rheingold brilliantly captured the zeitgeist of the emerging  Internet  with  his  book  entitled  Virtual  Communities:  Homesteading  on  the  Elec- tronic  Frontier.  Although  the  image  of  online  settings  as  communities  can  be  traced to the Internet’s founding documents  e.g., Licklider & Taylor, 1968 ,  Rheingold’s  characterization  captured  the  imagination  just  as  Internet  use  began to enter the mainstream of public consciousness. The community meta- phor was so successful that it effectively banished alternative metaphors of the  day   e.g.,  “information  superhighway” .  More  importantly,  the  community  metaphor continues to influence the way we think about and study the social  Internet. Nowhere is this more apparent than with contemporary social net- working sites  SNSs  such as MySpace and Facebook.   My goal in this chapter is to assess the status of online settings like MySpace  as sites for virtual communities. MySpace and other SNSs such as Facebook are  not communities in any singular sense, but rather function as social venues in  which many different communities may form. Thus I seek to determine what  conditions  are  necessary  for  the  formation  of  communities,  as  well  as  how  often and where they form. My approach is decidedly eclectic, drawing from  the historic literature on community, a large observational study of MySpace,  and on analyses of select cases. I begin by revisiting the community metaphor  in  contemporary  discourse  about  SNSs,  MySpace  in  particular,  and  then  ground the discussion in the more traditional sociological literature on com- munity. From there, we may assess the requirements for virtual communities,  ask how frequently SNS users are involved in community activity, and explore    106    Social Textures  the conditions that most facilitate the development of communities. All of this  will,  I  hope,  leave  us  at  chapter’s  end  with  a  renewed,  but  more  cautious,  appreciation of the concept of “virtual community.”  Social Network Sites as Virtual Communities  Today’s  social  network  sites  are  direct  heirs  to  the  community  metaphor  Rheingold  and  others  popularized  nearly  20  years  ago.  Like  many  of  their  Internet predecessors, SNSs carry expectations of sociability, meaningful con- nection to others, conviviality, perhaps even empathy and support. Whether  the actual interaction on these venues reaches the level of a “virtual commun- ity” depends on one’s perspective and definition, but there can be no question  that “community,” with all its affective and historical complications, will con- tinue to frame popular understanding of MySpace, Facebook, QQ, and other  SNSs. MySpace, for example, has been described as “an imagined egocentric  community”  boyd, 2006 . And Time magazine hailed MySpace as a powerful  technology  enabling  individuals  to  take  control  of  the  Information  Age  and  proclaimed it to be an “online metropolis” that promotes “community and col- laboration on a scale never seen before”  Grossman, 2006, p. 40 .   The internal rhetoric of social network sites often valorizes communal lan- guage and imagery as well. Facebook.com’s log in page proclaims, “Facebook  helps  you  connect  and  share  with  the  people  in  your  life.”  MySpace.com  describes  itself  as  a  place  to  “find  old  friends”  and  “make  new  friends,”  as  a  place to “connect,” and, in a word, as a “community.” The rhetoric of com- munity resonates among MySpace users as well. At this writing, for instance,  an  internal  search  of  MySpace  returns  approximately  317,000  references  to  “community.”   Debates  about  whether  people  can  find  community  or  community- like  experiences  online  continue  to  reverberate  in  academic  discourse.  Some  of  these  debates  take  extreme,  almost  Manichean,  forms   Wellman  &  Gulia,  1999 . Some hotly reject the concept of virtual community as a “confused oxy- moron”  Lockard, 1997, p. 224 , while others, including Wellman and Rhein- gold, advocate viewing online communities in terms of networks of personal  relationships  Rheingold, 2000; Wellman & Gulia, 1999 . Still others draw on  the  notion  that  SNSs  may  enhance  community  by  increasing  participants’  “social capital”  Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007; see also Ellison et al., this  volume,  Chapter  6 .  For  many,  the  community  metaphor  appears  to  be  accepted uncritically and used without further elaboration  e.g., Chua, 2009;  Fogel & Nehmad, 2008; Johnson, 2008; Sohn, 2008 , and yet it is difficult to  think of a social scientific concept in greater need of careful use and critical  elaboration.   Social Network Sites as Virtual Communities    107  What Constitutes “Community?”  The  concept  of  community  has  an  unsettled  intellectual  history  dating  back  nearly 200 years. Attention waxes and wanes with changes in scholarly fashion,  political conditions, and technology, but the term continues to resonate in our  lives. It does so, in part, because it feels good; it evokes feelings of friendli- ness, trust, and belonging that are often deemed lacking in ruthless, individu- alistic times  Bauman, 2001 . This nostalgic element has deep roots. In classic  treatises, Tönnies  1887 1957  and later Wirth  1938  argued that traditional,  densely- knit communities had been undermined by urbanization and industri- alization so that most people now experienced their social ties as transitory,  disconnected, and impersonal. Although there have been powerful responses  to these images of lost community  Bernard, 1973; Wellman, 1979; Wellman,  Carrington,  &  Hall,  1988 ,  yearnings  for  the  assumedly  deeper  connections  and greater belonging of the past still emanate from contemporary discussions  of virtual community. Rheingold  1993, p. 62 , for example, speculated that  the  popularity  of  online  communities  is  a  “response  to  the  hunger  for  com- munity that has followed the disintegration of traditional communities.”   Conceptualizations  of  community  are  further  complicated  by  tensions  between descriptive and prescriptive approaches, and by tensions between what  might be called “strong” and “weak” requirements. Social network theorists tend  to approach the concept descriptively, delineating the nature of social ties within  physical and mediated settings  Hampton & Wellman, 2003; Wellman & Gulia,  1999; Wellman et al., 1988 . But, as Willson  2006, p. 22  observed, others lay  down  “rigorous  outlines  of  what  a  community  is  and  how  it  should  behave.”  Chief among the prescriptivists are scholars calling for community renewal and  greater  civic  engagement   e.g.,  Putnam,  2000;  Putnam  &  Feldstein,  2003 .  Those who favor a “strong” conceptualization usually restrict the term to groups  of people who share physical space, are relatively self- sufficient within that space,  and who are linked by ties that include kinship  Bell & Newby, 1974; Kinton,  1975; Weinreich, 1997 . Over time, however, theorists have moved away from  conceptualizing community as a geographic entity to conceptualizing it in psy- chological  terms  or  as  quality  of  sociality   Amit,  2002 .  In  this  “weak”  sense,  community is viewed as a culture, a set of ideas and interpersonal sentiments  rather than as a physical place  Anderson, 1991; Bender, 1978; Calhoun, 1980 .  Within this framework, “virtual communities” are defined as social groups that  display  the  psychological  and  cultural  qualities  of  strong  community  without  physical proximity  Willson, 2006 .   Given these tensions, it is not surprising that nearly every scholar who has  surveyed the literature on community over the last half century has lamented  the conceptual turmoil  Bell & Newby, 1974; Hillery, 1955; Willson, 2006 .    108    Social Textures  In spite of this, a number of themes regularly reappear in definitions of com- munity and are, to varying degrees, relevant for the evaluation of SNSs as loca- tions  for  virtual  communities.  These  are  summarized  Table  5.1,  along  with  the behaviors of SNS users that would be required in order to participate in a  virtual  community.  The  defining  characteristics  of  community  are  discussed  below and the behaviors required of SNS users are discussed in the section that  follows.  The  first  two  requirements,  sharing  geographic  space  and  self-  sufficiency, represent the traditional “strong community” perspective and are  generally viewed as less relevant for virtual communities in which members,  almost by definition, do not share physical space or depend on one another for  the satisfaction of basic needs to any great degree.   Five recurrent themes in the literature on community can, I believe, serve as  criteria for evaluating the extent to which online groups function as virtual com- munities. The ability to engage in collective action is generally considered to be  an  essential  test  of  the  authenticity  of  any  community,  including  virtual  com- munities   Jones,  1995 .  Acting  collectively  both  reflects  and  reinforces  two  other  common  requirements  for  community,  namely,  that  the  group  think  of  itself as a community and that the members identify with the community  Bell &  Newby, 1974; Willson, 2006 . Communities are also created through the ritual- ized sharing of information  Carey, 1989; Jones, 1995 . To be sustained, a com- munity must engage in such information- sharing rituals on a regular basis.   Community is also constituted in the larger patterns of interaction that grow  out of regularized information exchange  Bell & Newby, 1974 . Although the  resulting interactive and relational structures are most evident in the public or  common  areas  of  the  community,  there  is  little  agreement  regarding  the  role  and importance of a “public commons” in the life of communities. Public areas  may  be  sites  for  behavior  that  enhances  community  cohesion,  but  behavior  in   Table 5.1   Recurring themes in definitions of community and associated requirements   on SNSs  Defining elements of community  Associated social requirements on SNSs  Less relevant for virtual communities    Sharing geographic space    Self-sufficiency More relevant for virtual communities    Ability to engage in collective action    Shared rituals, social regulation      Users must create and visit their   profiles with some regularity     Patterned interaction among members     Identification, a sense of belonging and      Users must personalize their profiles     Users must make social contacts and   attachment     Self-awareness of being a community  respond to other users   Social Network Sites as Virtual Communities    109  public  areas  may  threaten  cohesion  when  shared  resources  are  exploited  by  “free- riders” who do not contribute to the commonweal  e.g., Bonacich, 1990;  Kollock, 1998 . Cohesion and positive sentiment may thus depend as much on  private  ties  among  community  members  as  on  their  behavior  in  public  space   Bender, 1978 . Consistent with this view, researchers investigating online com- munities have suggested that distributed network structures can take the place of  a public commons  Sohn, 2008 . That is, interlinked private networks, such as  those  found  on  social  network  sites,  may  take  the  place  of  a  public  forum.  Indeed, rates of participation may actually be higher in these more diffuse net- works than in the shared public areas of online communities.   Finally,  definitions  of  community  typically  specify  that  members  exhibit  attachments  to  one  another  and  to  the  community  more  generally   Kantor,  1972; Willson, 2006 . “Communities are defined as shared, close, and intimate”   Jensen, 1990, p. 71 . These emotional bonds need not be experienced toward  every member of the community, but it is generally assumed that the majority of  members have personal attachments to at least some other members.  Community and the Social Affordances of  MySpace  Although  these  characteristics  of  community  provide  a  useful  framework  for  thinking about the constitutional requirements of virtual communities, they are  difficult to observe directly. Even if agreement could be reached on how these  characteristics might be measured, it is likely that the range and complexity of  data required for their assessment would create a major impediment to research.  An alternative strategy is to ask if the various elements of community depend on a  smaller, underlying set of social affordances that could be assessed more directly.   By “social affordances” I refer to the possibilities for action that are called  forth by a social technology or environment. Thus, pencils “call forth” writing;  telephones  call  forth  talking;  and  photocopier  stations  in  offices  call  forth  informal  interaction  among  the  employees  who  gather  around  them.  The  theory of affordances originated in work on visual perception  Gibson, 1979 ,  but  has  since  been  applied  to  texts,  social  technologies,  and  social  settings  more generally  e.g., Fayard & Weeks, 2007; Graves, 2007; Hutchby, 2001 .  It  provides  a  framework  for  identifying  the  characteristics  of  SNSs  like  MySpace that facilitate or “call forth” the constitutive elements of community.  I argue that three types of social affordances are required for the formation of  virtual  communities  on  social  network  sites:  affordances  of  membership,  expression,  and  connection   Table  5.1 .  The  discussion  of  these  affordances  below focuses on MySpace because I will be presenting research findings from  a study of MySpace later in the section that follows. This research sought to    110    Social Textures  determine how many MySpace users actually took advantage of each type of  affordance, and thus how many might have engaged in the foundational activ- ities essential for the higher- order experience of community.  Affordances of Membership  The  ease  and  durability  of  membership  in  MySpace  are  its  chief  social  affordances. Membership is open to all who state that they are aged 14 or older,  click  affirmatively  on  a  user  agreement,  and  who  have  not  been  identified  as  convicted  sexual  offenders.  Two  aspects  of  membership  may  be  directly  observed. The length of time since the user last logged in can be determined  from  the  date  of  the  member’s  most  recent  visit,  which  is  automatically  dis- played.  MySpace  also  allows  users  over  the  age  of  15  to  set  their  profile  to  “private” or “public.” Private profiles display only basic demographic informa- tion, a photo  if given , and the date of the most recent visit to the public. The  full profile is available only to those the user has accepted as “friends.” Public  profiles  display  the  full  range  of  content  regardless  of  whether  one  is  on  the  user’s friend list. Because the choice of private public display has a fundamental  effect  on  how  others  might  relate  to  an  individual,  it  represents  a  significant  communicative affordance. Public profiles facilitate the formation of weak ties  among unacquainted people to a greater degree than private profiles and there- fore encourage community formation and cohesion.  Affordances of Personal Expression  MySpace,  perhaps  more  than  other  SNSs,  is  rich  in  affordances  for  personal  expression. Two basic affordances of personal expression were examined in this  study. The first was whether or not the user had customized his or her profile  page.  Customization  allows  users  to  express  themselves  more  individually  by  altering their profile’s standard fonts and background colors, by embedding new  elements such as music or video, and by rearranging the page layout. The second  category of expressive choice examined in this study was whether or not users  provided a personal picture. Visual images express individuality and open users  to more individualized responses in return. Although MySpace affords a variety  of more specific mechanisms for self- expression, the opportunity to customize  content and to upload personal pictures are two of the most basic.  Affordances of Connection  MySpace  enables  users  to  establish  connections  with  one  another  using  a  variety  of  tools—direct  messages,  creation  of  groups,  “friending,”  instant    Social Network Sites as Virtual Communities    111  messaging, bulletins, and comments posted on the recipient’s site. Of these,  the two most visible are the linkages between friends and the posting of com- ments.  Although  “friending”  enables  a  variety  of  relationships  on  MySpace   boyd, 2006 , with some exceptions, the number of individual friends one has  would appear to be an obvious indicator of social connectivity. Social connec- tivity  is  also  enhanced  when  users  post  comments  on  each  other’s  profiles.  Users who take advantage of these two affordances of connectivity are more  likely to experience the involvement, identification, attachment, and sense of  belonging  characteristic  of  community.  Those  with  little  social  connectivity  are unlikely to experience MySpace as a community.   To  summarize  in  more  general  terms,  although  “community”  and  “virtual  community” have enduring rhetorical and cultural appeal, the concept of com- munity  is  notoriously  slippery.  However,  by  extracting  the  most  common  themes running through the previous literature, we may get at least a general  sense of what is necessary if we are to designate a social group as a “community.”  For  online  settings  such  as  social  network  sites,  the  most  relevant  of  these  requirements  are  engaging  in  shared  rituals,  social  regulation,  and  collective  action  through  patterned  interaction  and  the  creation  of  relational  linkages  among  members  that  promote  emotional  bonds,  a  sense  of  belonging,  and  a  sense of identification with the community. While this complex of actions and  sentiments is difficult to observe directly, we can directly observe the extent to  which participants utilize the basic social affordances of a venue like MySpace— social affordances that constitute the raw materials for the higher- order elements  of  community.  Wide  utilization  of  the  affordances  of  membership,  personal  expression,  and  connectivity  would  suggest  that  MySpace  provides  fertile  grounds  for  the  development  of  virtual  communities,  while  limited  utilization  would suggest that MySpace is, whatever its other social and commercial func- tions, not living up to its billing as a site rich in virtual communities. In the next  section, I present the results of an observational study intended to assess just how  commonly these affordances are used by the members of MySpace.  How Often Do Members Utilize the Social  Affordances of MySpace?  Study Description  A large- scale observational study was conducted in the summer of 2007 to deter- mine the extent to which people who created profiles on MySpace also utilized  the affordances of membership, personal expression, and connection. The initial  sample  of  2,000  profiles  was  randomly  selected  based  on  MySpace  profile  identification numbers. The final sample was reduced to 1,500 by the exclusion    112    Social Textures  of invalid or deleted profiles  20.5%  and by the exclusion of commercial sites  belonging to entertainers, celebrities, businesses, and sites belonging to groups  rather than individuals  4.5% . Reported age in the final sample ranged from 14  to  84,  but  75%  were  aged  25  or  younger.  Males  and  females  were  almost  equally represented among subjects aged 21 or younger, but males significantly  outnumbered females among members over the age of 21.   Seven aspects of MySpace use were coded for each profile. To assess member- ship activity, we calculated the number of days since the most recent log in and  noted whether the profile was public or private. To assess personal expression, we  coded whether or not the user had customized his or her profile page in some  fashion, and whether or not the user had provided a personal profile picture. Pic- tures that did not obviously include the individual were excluded. Finally, to assess  connectivity, we counted the number of friends listed, the number of comments  received from others, and the number of days since the most recent comment had  been received. These latter measures were available only for public profile pages.  Friendship counts were corrected by excluding “friends” who appeared to repre- sent  music  groups,  celebrities,  politicians,  fan  sites,  business- oriented  sites,  or  MySpace administrators  e.g., “Tom” . Any profile whose primary function was  to promote a person or product for commercial or political gain rather than to  describe  an  individual  and  his her  interests  was  excluded  on  the  grounds  that  these linkages were less likely to trigger the interpersonal feelings and behaviors  associated with the concept of community. Reliabilities for these measures were  calculated using 20% of the final sample and ranged from 0.82 to 0.99.  Membership Activity  Our initial analyses revealed that MySpace contained a large number of profiles  belonging to individuals who had not used MySpace recently. Of the 1,500 pro- files examined, 569  37.9%  had not been visited by their owners in the past six  months. In order to avoid biasing the results by including subjects who essen- tially no longer used MySpace, the remaining analysis was limited to people who  had logged in within the previous six months  n = 931 . Although the average  number of days since the last visit was over a month for this group, 52.4% had  logged in within the past week  M = 34.17 days, Mdn = 5.00, SD = 50.75 .   There were few demographic differences in how often people visited their  profiles.  Visits  by  males  and  females  were  equally  recent.  People  who  self-  classified as Whites, Blacks, or Hispanics had logged in equally recently. Older  users had not logged in quite as recently as younger users, but the correlation  was  quite  small   r = 0.10,  p < 0.05   and  the  fact  that  most  users  were  aged  between 15 and 22 should be kept in mind. Very few people classified them- selves as divorced or as “swingers.” But users who were married  M = 20.98    Social Network Sites as Virtual Communities    113  days,  SD = 39.33   or  “in  a  relationship”   M = 20.98  days,  SD = 37.34   had  logged in significantly more recently than people who were single  M = 45.57  days, SD = 55.08, F2,570 = 12.21, p < 0.001 .   Another  fundamental  affordance  of  membership  is  the  ability  to  regulate  access  to  the  information  others  may  view.  Most  users   63.8%   made  their  sites  public—allowing  any  other  member  to  view  them.  The  proportion  of  private sites  36.2%  reflects MySpace policy that automatically sets the sites  of  all  users  under  the  age  of  16  to  private.  A  majority  of  16  year  olds  kept  their sites private as well  59.4% , but 77.3% of the sites of older users were  public. Thus most users make their profiles public as soon as or shortly after  they  are  allowed  to  do  so.  Although  the  majority  of  men  and  majority  of  women made their sites public, more females than males set their profiles to  private  34.8% vs. 17.4%,  χ2 = 31.04, df = 1, p < 0.0001 .  Personal Expression  If MySpace supports communities of engaged users, we might expect to see  that most of its members actively express themselves as individuals. This may  be done either by customizing the standard format of one’s profile page or by  adding personal content. We found that over two- thirds of users  69.4%  did  not customize their profile pages in spite of the fact that tools and templates  for doing so are widely available. Customization was unrelated to gender, self-  reported  education,  sexual  orientation,  or  ethnicity.  The  relational  status  of  the user, however, was associated with customization. Married users  59.6%   and  users  “in  a  relationship”   65.3%   customized  their  profiles  significantly  more often than single users  41.3%,  χ2 = 21.33, df = 2, p < 0.001 . Customi- zation rates also differed by age group   χ2 = 13.02, df = 5, p < 0.05 . Younger  users  were  more  likely  to  customize  their  pages  than  older  users,  with  the  highest rate of customization  41.6%  observed among those aged 19–21 and  the lowest rate  24.3%  observed among those over the age of 33.   Displaying a photograph of oneself represents one of the most basic forms  of personal expression in online settings. Photographs convey a personal pres- ence  that  textual  material  does  not.  Slightly  over  half  of  MySpace  members   54.9%  included a photograph of themselves as part of their profile, but many  did not  38.3% , and some  6.9%  included a photo that was either ambigu- ous  or  contained  too  many  other  persons  to  allow  identification.  The  likeli- hood of posting a personal picture did not differ by gender or by self- reported  education level, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Married users  74.5%  and  users in relationships  73.4%  were significantly more likely than single users   49.7%  to display a photo of themselves   χ2 = 26.70, df = 4, p < 0.001 . The  likelihood  of  displaying  a  personal  picture  varied  across  age  groups    114    Social Textures    χ2 = 52.61, df = 12, p < 0.0001 . The lowest rates of display were among the  youngest and oldest users—only 42% of 14–15 year olds and 38.8% of those  over the age of 33 displayed a personal picture. The highest rates of display,  ranging from 66.2% to 66.9%, were among those aged 19–24.  Connection  Being connected to others fosters a sense of purpose, belonging, and attach- ment that is central to the concept of community. To evaluate how frequently  such  connections  occurred  on  MySpace,  we  evaluated  the  size  of  users’  “friend”  lists  and  the  number  of  comments  they  had  received  from  others.  While we did not attempt to differentiate friends in terms of function or rela- tional strength, we did exclude links to musical groups, political figures, celeb- rities, and others with whom an individual was unlikely to have an actual social  relationship. Even among those who had logged into MySpace within the pre- vious six months, the number of friends varied dramatically, ranging from 0 to  4,039. The mean number of friends was 46.61  SD = 179.08 , but most had  fewer. Half listed seven or fewer friends and just over one- third  33.7%  listed  no friends at all.   Connections with others are also reflected in the comments friends post to  the user’s profile. These comments reflect more personally directed, but still  public,  communication  between  users.  The  number  of  comments  users  had  received  ranged  from  0  to  3,067.  Although  the  average  was  81.10   SD = 266.22 ,  the  majority  of  users  had  received  far  fewer  comments.  The  median was five comments and mode was zero. Nearly 40% of the public pro- files had no comments from friends. It is possible that users have deleted com- ments that were no longer current, but we saw little evidence of this. Among  those receiving at least one comment  n = 355 , the average length of time since  the  most  recent  comment  had  been  received  was  37.21  days   SD = 75.32 .  Although just over half had received a comment in the past week, one- quarter   26.2%  had not received a comment in the previous 30 days.   There were few demographic differences in the number of friends MySpace  users  listed,  the  number  of  comments  they  received  from  friends,  or  in  how  recently  the  latest  comment  had  been  received.  Age  was  modestly,  but  nega- tively,  associated  with  the  number  of  friends   r = –0.12,  p < 0.01   and  the  number  of  comments   r = –0.19,  p < 0.001 ,  but  not  with  how  recently  the  latest comment had been received. There were no significant gender differences.  Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites did not significantly differ in terms of the number  of friends listed, the number of comments received, and how recently the last  comment had been received. There were also no differences between those who  reported their relational status as single, “in a relationship,” or married.   Social Network Sites as Virtual Communities    115    Looking  across  these  analyses,  it  appears,  first  of  all,  that  a  substantial  portion of those who have created MySpace profiles use them rarely, if ever.  Even if we restrict consideration to those who have visited their profiles within  the past six months, no more than one- third to a half utilize the various social  affordances of MySpace. Only about half log in on a weekly basis. Only about  one- third of users customize their profiles and only slightly over half provide a  picture  of  themselves.  Thus,  while  the  majority  made  their  profiles  publicly  accessible, the information available to others was often quite limited. Social  contacts between users also appeared to be limited. Half of users listed fewer  than seven friends, one- third listed no friends at all, and 40% had received no  comments from others. It is possible that users rely on other less visible social  connections such as private messaging, but the overall picture emerging from  this survey is one in which the majority of users have relatively low levels of  activity, personal expression, and connectivity. Moreover, although there are  noteworthy  demographic  variations  in  this  pattern,  utilization  of  the  social  affordances of MySpace appears to be low regardless of gender, age, relational  status, and ethnicity.   The levels of activity, personal expression, and connectivity found in this  study  are  much  lower  than  those  found  in  two  previous  studies  of  MySpace   Jones,  Millermaier,  Goya- Martinez,  &  Schuler,  2008;  Liu,  2007 .  Closer  inspection  of  these  studies,  however,  reveals  that  each  utilized  a  sampling  frame that biased results in favor of finding unrepresentatively high levels of  user engagement by focusing either on members with a specified number of  friends  or  on  users  who  had  logged  in  recently.  Two  other  studies  that  employed  random  samples  of  the  full  spectrum  of  MySpace  users  have  reported levels of member activity, personal expression, and connectivity con- sistent with those found here  Parks, 2009; Thelwall, 2008 .   Together with the results of those studies, the results of the present study  suggest that the majority of MySpace members do not utilize the rudimentary  social  affordances  necessary  for  the  formation  of  virtual  communities.  This  does  not  mean  that  members  do  not  experience  community  in  this  online  setting, but it does imply that the qualities of community are experienced by  only  a  small  portion  of  MySpace  users.  In  the  next  section  we  attempt  to  specify how big that group might be and identify the conditions under which  communities are most likely to form.  How Often Do Communities Form on MySpace  and What Encourages Community Formation?  It appears that virtual communities are relatively rare on MySpace. That is, the  portion  of  users  who  are  active  enough,  express  themselves  in  individuating    116    Social Textures  ways often enough, and who interact with others frequently enough to gener- ate the higher- order characteristics of community is quite small. But how small  is it?   The answer obviously depends on how criteria are set, but we can at least  get a sense of the possibilities by specifying both a set of minimal parameters  and a set of more demanding, but not overly restrictive, parameters. What is  the minimum set of requirements for membership in a virtual community on  MySpace? I propose, somewhat arbitrarily, that in order for an individual to  qualify  as  a  member  of  a  virtual  community,  he  or  she  must  have  logged  in  within  the  past  three  months,  have  a  personal  picture,  have  at  least  two  friends, and have received at least two comments from friends. A more robust  set of requirements might insist on higher levels of engagement—say, logging  in within the past seven days, displaying a personal picture, having 10 or more  friends, and receiving 10 or more comments.   We  returned  to  our  data  to  see  how  many  users  actually  satisfied  these  minimal or more robust criteria for community. Out of the original sample of  1,500  profiles,  16.5%  met  our  minimal  criteria  and  13.5%  met  our  more  robust criteria. The proportion meeting these criteria increases if we exclude  those  who  have  not  logged  in  within  the  past  six  months.  In  this  restricted  sample of 931 profiles, 26.7% met our minimal criteria and 21.7% met our  more robust criteria. Again, one should not conclude that roughly a quarter of  MySpace  users  are  active  in  virtual  communities—only  that  a  maximum  of  approximately one- quarter are potentially eligible for membership in a virtual  community by virtue of their membership activity, creation of an online iden- tity, and social connections to others.   Who are these more engaged users? Those who met and failed to meet our  criteria did not differ in age. Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics were equally likely  to  meet  both  the  minimal  and  more  robust  criteria.  On  the  other  hand,  a  greater proportion of women met the criteria. Married subjects or subjects in  relationships  were  more  likely  to  meet  the  criteria  than  single  people.  However, case analyses of several highly engaged users revealed another char- acteristic that may be essential for the formation of virtual community. Two  cases,  randomly  selected  from  among  the  most  active  users,  are  offered  by  way of illustration.  Case 1: Mike—20-Year- Old Male  At  the  time  of  data  collection,  Mike  was  20  years  old,  had  completed  high  school, and was living in his hometown of Texarkana, a city of approximately  80,000 people split between the states of Texas and Arkansas. Mike indicated  that  he  was  currently  involved  in  a  relationship  and  prominently  displayed    Social Network Sites as Virtual Communities    117  pictures of himself, his girlfriend, and his car. Mike’s friends list included 79  people. Females slightly outnumbered males, but the most striking feature of  Mike’s  social  network  was  revealed  when  we  examined  each  of  the  friends’  profiles. Of the 67 who gave location information, approximately 66% lived  within 10–15 miles of Mike. His MySpace network was therefore essentially a  local network.  Case 2: Anjoli—17-Year- Old Female  At the time of data collection, Anjoli was a 17-year- old high school student  living  in  Mesquite,  a  suburb  of  Dallas  with  a  population  of  approximately  136,000. She described herself in this way: “basically I’m a woman who can  handle  her  own,  smart,  got  a  lot  going  for  myself.”  She  appeared  to  log  in  regularly, displayed a playful picture of herself with a friend, and listed a total  of 105 friends. Each friend profile was examined and, when available, location  information was used to calculate how far each person lived from Anjoli. Of  the 86 who gave location information, 76% lived in Mesquite itself. An addi- tional 14% lived within approximately 15 miles of Mesquite. Thus it appeared  that 90% of Anjoli’s MySpace friends lived within a relatively short distance of  Anjoli herself.   While hardly a definitive analysis, these and several other cases suggest that  local, geographically shared connections may form a foundation for high levels  of activity on social network sites like MySpace. It would seem that those who  have rich sets of offline connections that can be transported to MySpace are  more likely to become active users and to have rich sets of online connections.  Virtual Communities in Perspective  The rise of online discussion groups and other social venues in the early 1990s  renewed interest in the concept of community and introduced the concept of  a virtual community. Today’s social network sites such as MySpace and Face- book are simply the latest, and arguably most complete, online social venues  where  virtual  communities  might  form.  The  purpose  of  this  chapter  was  to  explicate the concept of virtual community and to determine how often and  under what conditions the underlying requirements for community formation  were being met in the behavior of typical MySpace users.   Although scholars have never settled on a single definition of community,  there are nonetheless a small number of themes that recur in the literature and  which can be used to think about the nature and requirements of virtual com- munities. Based on common themes in community literature, I suggested that  a  group  might  qualify  as  a  virtual  community  if  its  members  engaged  in    118    Social Textures  collective  action,  shared  in  rituals,  had  a  variety  of  relational  linkages,  and  were emotionally bonded to others in a way that conferred a sense of belong- ing and group identification. Social network sites certainly provide the func- tionality,  the  social  affordances,  necessary  to  satisfy  these  requirements.  MySpace, like many other SNSs, provides easy access to diverse people, offers  a rich set of options for users to express and address their personal interests,  and  is  structured  so  as  to  facilitate  communication  and  relational  formation  among members. Moreover, those who design and market SNSs have emphas- ized the relational and communal potential of these sites. It is therefore not  surprising that both academic and popular observers have described SNSs like  MySpace as virtual communities.   The community metaphor, however, merits close examination, particularly  because  it  resonates  so  deeply  with  individual  and  cultural  aspirations.  Although  it  is  difficult  to  assess  each  of  the  components  of  community  in  a  large, diverse setting like MySpace, it was possible to explore how many users  met  a  set  of  underlying  requirements  for  activity,  personal  expression,  and  connectivity. Just as astrobiologists search for life in extraterrestrial environ- ments  indirectly  by  looking  for  chemical  and  molecular  signatures,  my  approach  was  to  search  for  evidence  of  the  building  blocks  of  community  rather than for the more elusive communities themselves.   The results of an observational study of randomly selected MySpace profiles  indicate that these building blocks of community occur much less often than is  commonly assumed. Substantial numbers of users visit their profiles only very  rarely, if at all—indeed nearly 40% visit so infrequently as to raise doubts about  their continued membership. Rates of site personalization and social connectivity  were generally low, even among users who had logged into MySpace within the  past six months. The majority of people who create MySpace accounts clearly  fail  to  visit  them  enough,  interact  enough,  or  make  enough  contacts  to  meet  even the most minimal requirements of a “virtual community.”   Perhaps it is well to remember that social networking sites like MySpace  are  commercial  enterprises.  Although  they  may  have  been  originally  con- structed with the hope of building community, they are increasingly viewed as  “monetization opportunities” by developers and investors  Virgin, 2007 . As  these sites grow in size and commercial value, the community metaphor may  come to refer more to marketing appeals than to the actual quality of inter- action  and  social  engagement  among  members.  MySpace,  for  example,  markets  itself  as  “a  place  for  friends,”  but  many  members  have  few  or  no  friends  there.  At  some  point,  the  disjunction  of  market  image  and  member  experience  may  cause  people  to  turn  away  from  social  networking  sites.  Indeed, the large number of seemingly abandoned profiles we found suggests  that more than a few users have already turned away.   Social Network Sites as Virtual Communities    119    Perhaps  the  fault  lies  not  in  our  sites  but  in  ourselves.  Users  may  bring  unrealistic expectations for the level of social connection and community that  can  be  created  with  social  networking  applications  like  MySpace.  In  other  cases, users may exhibit an inflated sense of technological agency. That is, they  may expect that creating a profile will, more or less on its own, lead to friend- ships and meaningful social connections. When the technology fails to produce  the expected social result, users become disenchanted and drift away.   Alternatively it could be that, although social networking sites are touted as  sites  for  community,  users  themselves  are  really  seeking  theater,  or  at  least  something much more akin to a mass medium. The behavior of large portion  of  participants  more  closely  resembles  that  of  passive  viewers  or  audience  members  than  that  of  active  participants  in  a  community.  This  is  consistent  with the perspective that SNSs function as a form of theater  Mathias, 2007 .  The  entertainment  element  is  further  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  MySpace  celebrities are beginning to cross over to more traditional mass media and by  the growing number of advertisements, movie trailers, and other material that  is typically associated with traditional mass media. More research is needed to  determine if the content on social networking sites is becoming more stand- ardized and users are becoming more passive, but MySpace does appear to be  transitioning from a social network to a “social portal” for the delivery of tele- vision programming, music, and complex promotions linking advertisers with  entertainment content  McGirt, 2008 .   Although virtual communities do not materialize on MySpace as often as is  generally  assumed,  we  did  find  that  between  15%–25%  of  members  were  active  enough,  had  established  a  sufficient  identity,  and  had  forged  enough  social  ties  to  at  least  meet  the  minimal  requirements  for  the  formation  of  virtual  communities.  The  biggest  difference  between  these  users  and  less  engaged users, I believe, is that they draw more extensively on pre- existing  offline networks, especially their local networks. The evidence supporting this  speculation is still largely anecdotal, but it is consistent with the “critical mass”  theory of interactive media  e.g., Hiltz, 1984; Markus, 1987; Rogers, 1986 .  This  theory  argues  that  people  are  more  likely  to  adopt  a  new  interactive  medium when others they know have also adopted it. This implies that new  users will become active, committed users of an SNS only when they find that  a sizable number of their existing contacts are already using it. Compared to  MySpace  users  who  discover  few  of  their  existing  friends  online,  users  who  discover  that  many  existing  friends  are  using  MySpace  will  become  more  active users, be more motivated to flesh out their online identities, and will  list more people as friends.   This speculation suggests a new line of research and a very different per- spective  on  the  concept  of  virtual  community.  Specifically  it  reinforces  calls    120    Social Textures  for research on “mixed- mode” relationships that exist in both online and offline  settings  Walther & Parks, 2002 . Recent research, for instance, indicates that  people who use SNSs to learn more about people they have met or observed  in offline settings may feel more a part of and more connected to their offline  communities   Ellison,  Steinfield,  &  Lampe,  2009 .  A  recent  study  of  Teen  Second Life suggests that adolescents tend to make friends with users who live  in the same area offline than with users who do not  Foucault, Zhu, Huang,  Atrash,  &  Contractor,  2009 .  It  appears,  then,  that  offline  and  online  com- munities are linked in ways that we are only beginning to understand.   Importantly, these findings imply that virtual communities are not so virtual  after  all.  If  our  case  studies  and  the  findings  on  friendship  choices  on  Teen  Second Life  Foucault et al., 2009  are correct, then geographically proximal  offline  communities  are  frequently  the  foundation  for  “virtual”  online  com- munities. Although it is widely assumed that computer- mediated communica- tion  frees  individuals  from  the  limits  of  physical  proximity,  it  appears  social  connections  in  online  settings  may  depend  on  offline  contact.  It  is  revealing  that the WELL, the virtual community that Howard Rheingold  1993, 2000   elevated to iconic status, actually depended on regular face- to-face gatherings  of its San Francisco- based members  for a history of the WELL, see Hafner,  2001 .  Willson   2006,  p.  16   defined  virtual  communities  as  “communities  without  propinquity,”  but  it  may  be  more  accurate  to  say  that  virtual  com- munities  are  often  simply  the  online  extension  of  geographically  situated  offline communities.

Ellison, Cliff Lampe,   Charles Steinfield, and Jessica Vitak  Introduction  In  this  chapter,  we  will  describe  two  related  strands  of  research—social  capital gains and online offline interaction patterns—to explicate the mech- anisms by which social capital is generated and maintained on social network  sites   SNSs .  This  chapter  reviews  a  series  of  studies  we  have  conducted  investigating  college  undergraduates’  use  of  Facebook,  one  of  the  most  popular SNSs among undergraduate students in the United States. This body  of research explores two primary questions. First, what are the social capital  implications,  if  any,  of  Facebook  use  by  students,  specifically  in  relation  to  bridging and bonding social capital? Second, how is Facebook integrated into  the daily communication practices of its users? Specifically, are users articu- lating existing relationships in Facebook, or are they using the site to discover  and  interact  with  strangers?  We  review  extant  literature  examining  these  questions, and then summarize our studies over the last four years. Finally,  we describe the mechanisms by which we believe these two sets of findings  are related.   Facebook  shares  a  set  of  characteristics  with  hundreds  of  other  SNSs,  defined as:  web- based  services  that  allow  individuals  to   1   construct  a  public  or  semi- public profile within a bounded system,  2  articulate a list of other  users with whom they share a connection, and  3  view and traverse their  list of connections and those made by others within the system.   boyd & Ellison, 2007, p. 211   After  creating  a  profile,  SNS  users  typically  add  contacts   called  “Friends”  on Facebook  who are bi- directionally linked, meaning that both users must  approve of the connection before it is valid. These Friends can usually see    Social Network Sites and Social Capital    125  one another’s full profile by default  although privacy settings are available  to  control  who  sees  what .1  Facebook  facilitates  communication  among  these  network  ties;  it  contains  a  suite  of  communication  tools,  such  as  instant  messaging,  wall  posts,  and  comments,  and  allows  users  to  share  photos,  short  essays   “notes”   and  Web  links  with  one  another.  Since  its  introduction in 2004, Facebook has been very popular among college under- graduates.  The  site  is  highly  used  by  undergraduate  students:  among  the  94% of students ages 18–24 who report using any SNSs, 94% use Facebook,  compared  with  just  45%  who  report  using  MySpace   Salaway,  Caruso,  &  Nelson, 2008 .   This chapter focuses on college students’ use of Facebook, both because  it is deeply integrated into the daily communication practices of the popula- tion we study and because of the special role that SNSs play during this crit- ical time of life. Arnett  2000  argues that the period between the ages of 18  and  25,  which  he  calls  “emerging  adulthood,”  is  critical  to  an  individual’s  social and psychological development. He writes, “Emerging adulthood is a  time of life . . . when the scope of independent exploration of life’s possibil- ities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life  course”  p. 469 . It is also a time of transition, when young people are likely  to  be  leaving  their  hometowns  and  established  social  networks  for  a  new  environment. Examining how they form new relationships and maintain old  ones—and  the  role  of  SNSs  like  Facebook  in  this  process—is  critical  for  understanding  how  social  capital  is  accumulated  and  maintained  for  this  population.  Theoretical Frameworks: Online Offline  Communication and Social Capital  Online and Offline Communication  Like  other  communication  technologies,  Internet- enabled  communication  tools such as email allow users to reshape temporal and spatial constraints on  communication. It should come as no surprise, then, that much of the early  research on computer- mediated communication  CMC  focused on instances  in which online tools were used to connect those who did not otherwise share  time  and  space.  Popular  narratives  and  formative  research  on  early  online  communities  assumed  that  users  of  these  systems  would  be  connecting  with  others based on shared interests, as opposed to shared geography  Rheingold,  1993 ,  thus  producing  communities  that  were  sometimes  limited  to  online  communication.  Often,  these  online  connections  resulted  in  face- to-face  meetings,  but  when  this  happened,  the  directionality  was  online  connections    126    Social Textures  that resulted in offline meetings. For instance, Parks and Floyd  1996  report  that one- third of their respondents later met their online correspondents face-  to-face. As they write, “These findings imply that relationships that begin on  line rarely stay there”  n.p. . Online- to-offline interaction is still a core part of  many  online  contexts.  For  instance,  online  dating  sites  such  as  Match.com,  which began gaining popularity in the mid- 1990s, function to bring together  individuals who have never met. Of course, in organizational and other set- tings, CMC tools such as email were used for communication among people  who were co- located or had previous face- to-face interactions  an “offline- to- online” interaction pattern .   Because  interaction  patterns  among  individuals  and  the  ways  they  employ  face- to-face and mediated communication are complex, researchers face a chal- lenging  task  when  they  attempt  to  assess  and  describe  these  practices.  Many  instances are not as clear- cut as two co- located colleagues who use instant mes- saging for quick exchanges during the day, or two strangers who encounter one  another in an online gaming environment and then arrange to meet face- to-face.  Designing measures for accurately assessing these interaction patterns is difficult  for  many  reasons.  Terminology  is  not  widely  agreed  on   e.g.,  definitions  of  “online” and “offline” , and users may have different understandings of what they  mean. Survey questions about “where” an individual first “met” a communication  partner can be both ambiguous and leading. Additionally, the complex commu- nication  ecology  many  of  us  inhabit  is  not  reflected  by  questions  that  assume  “online” and “offline” to be dichotomous spaces—for instance, how would one  categorize  a  situation  in  which  someone  uses  information  from  a  Facebook  profile to initiate a face- to-face conversation? Because of the way in which Face- book is integrated into the complex communication ecologies of its users, it is  critical  that  SNS  researchers  acknowledge  and  meet  these  measurement  challenges.   There is some evidence that SNSs are more often used to articulate previously  established relationships than to meet strangers. boyd and Ellison  2007  argue  that the term “social network sites” reflects actual usage patterns, in that indi- viduals typically use the sites to articulate and reflect offline social relationships,  and are generally not trying to meet strangers on the site  as might be suggested  by the term “social networking sites” . Pew data suggest that nearly all  91%   teens who use SNSs do so to connect with current friends  Lenhart & Madden,  2007 ,  and  other  research  generally  supports  this  perception   e.g.,  Mayer  &  Puller, 2008 .   In summary, although SNSs enable users to connect with strangers, this is  not typically the norm, and more work is needed to develop instruments that  capture  nuances  of  hybrid   online offline   interaction  patterns  and  their  impact on relationship development and maintenance.   Social Network Sites and Social Capital    127  Social Capital  Overview  Social  capital  as  a  theoretical  framework  is  rooted  in  the  work  of  Bourdieu   1985   and  Coleman   1988 ,  with  subsequent  development  by  Burt   1992 ,  Putnam  1995, 2000 , and Lin  2001 , among others. Broadly conceived, social  capital  refers  to  the  benefits  that  can  be  attained  from  connections  between  people through their social networks  Putnam, 2000 . More specifically, it can  be  considered  as  “the  aggregate  of  the  actual  or  potential  resources  which  are  linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized rela- tionships  of  mutual  acquaintance  and  recognition”   Bourdieu,  1985,  p.  248 .  Definitions and measurement of social capital consider the role of social struc- ture  Burt, 2000; Coleman, 1988; Portes, 1998 , social norms  Adler & Kwon,  2002;  Putnam,  2000 ,  trust   Burt,  2000;  Putnam,  2000;  Woolcock,  1998 ,  reciprocity  Lin, 2001; Putnam, 2000; Woolcock, 1998 , flow of information   Lin,  2001;  Adler  &  Kwon,  2002 ,  and  solidarity   Putnam,  2000;  Adler  &  Kwon, 2002 . Definitions of social capital also vary in their focus on the sub- stance, sources, or effects of social capital, as well as their focus on internal or  external ties  Adler & Kwon, 2002 . More recently, scholars have distinguished  between offline social capital and online—or sociotechnical—capital  Resnick,  2001;  Wellman  &  Gulia,  1999;  Williams,  2006 ,  based  on  the  unique  affordances online tools provide for communicating with a wide range of people.   Social capital evokes many dimensions of financial and human capital, but  focuses  on  the  relationships  between  individuals.  Through  this  network  of  relationships,  the  individual  in  turn  receives  opportunities  to  obtain  or  use  other forms of capital  Burt, 1992 . Members of one’s social network can be  categorized  according  to  the  strength  of  the  tie,  which  Granovetter   1973   defines as a combination of the amount of time, emotional intensity, intimacy,  and reciprocity involved in the relationship. One component of network struc- ture  relates  to  the  concepts  of  bridging  and  bonding  social  capital,  each  of  which  are  associated  with  different  kinds  of  ties  and  network  structures.  Putnam  2000  refers to bridging social capital as inclusive and better suited  for information diffusion; it is created through exposure to heterogeneous net- works,  with  the  majority  of  connections  representing  weak  ties.  Bonding  social capital, on the other hand, can be exclusive and aids in creating group  solidarity.  Bonding  social  capital  is  created  among  groups  of  strongly  con- nected individuals such as one’s family and closest friends. Whereas bridging  social capital provides access to a wider range of information and diverse per- spectives, bonding social capital is linked to social support and more substan- tive support, such as financial loans.   128    Social Textures    Granovetter  1973  argues that weak ties often serve as bridges, connecting  otherwise disparate groups of individuals. Burt  1992  calls these gaps between  groups  “structural  holes”  and  suggests  that  individuals  whose  networks  span  these holes are at an advantage because they have access to a more diverse set  of  information  and  can  better  control  the  flow  of  that  information  between  groups,  thus  garnering  more  bridging  social  capital.  As  will  be  discussed  below, the Internet provides individuals with increased opportunities to locate  and interact with members outside of their network, subsequently increasing  opportunities for bridging social capital outcomes.  The Internet’s Impact on Social Capital  The Internet provides individuals with new ways to interact with members of  their existing social networks and to make new connections through a variety  of  synchronous  and  asynchronous  forms  of  communication,  thus  reshaping  social networks and the ability of members to draw social capital from them.  However,  there  has  been  a  long- standing  debate  over  whether  the  Internet  plays a positive or negative role in people’s social lives, relationships, sense of  community and, subsequently, their social capital. Early ethnographic research  on  virtual  communities  portrayed  the  Internet  as  a  space  where  individuals  could overcome the constraints of space and time to form close and meaning- ful relationships with others who shared common interests  e.g., Baym, 1997;  Rheingold, 1993; Wellman & Gulia, 1999 . Empirical research has also found  that the level of interaction over the Internet is positively related to indicators  of social capital, such as generalized trust  Best & Krueger, 2006 . Likewise,  Hampton and Wellman  2002  found that Internet users were more connected  to their community offline than non- users, as indicated by their greater know- ledge of and interaction with their neighbors.   On the other hand, several researchers suggest the Internet may be having the  opposite effect, isolating and alienating people from their communities, which  would in turn negatively impact social capital. In an early longitudinal study of  Internet users during their first one to two years online, Kraut, Patterson, Lund- mark, Kiesler, Mukopadhyay, and Scherlis  1998  found small negative effects of  Internet use on people’s social involvement and psychological well- being; a fol- low- up study found that these effects dissipated over time, but that those with  strong  support  networks  experienced  more  benefits  than  those  with  weaker  support networks  Kraut, Kiesler, Boneva, Cummings, Helgeson, & Crawford,  2002a . Nie  2001  argues that the Internet does not make people more socia- ble, as the types of people who use the Internet are already highly sociable, and  that time spent using the Internet implies less time for face- to-face relationships.  Although  they  primarily  advocate  that  positive  social  outcomes  are  associated    Social Network Sites and Social Capital    129  with  Internet  use,  Wellman,  Quan- Haase,  Witte,  and  Hampton   2001   note  that it may also reduce individuals’ commitment to community.   A third perspective suggests that the Internet should not be defined in such  extreme terms, but rather considered as a supplement to other forms of inter- action. For example, in their study of technology use and interaction among  members of a Toronto suburb, Hampton and Wellman  2002  found that the  Internet did not replace other methods of communication, such as telephone  or  face- to-face  interaction,  but  filled  the  gap  when  other  methods  of  inter- action were unavailable. Likewise, Wellman et al.  2001  found that the Inter- net neither increased nor decreased other forms of communication, and that it  supplemented  organizational  and  political  participation.  In  other  words,  the  Internet neither diminishes nor transforms social capital, but instead serves an  additive  role  when  combined  with  other  methods  of  communication   Quan  Haase & Wellman, 2004; Uslaner, 2000 .   In  line  with  this  third  approach  to  viewing  social  capital  on  the  Internet,  Resnick  2001  suggests the construct of sociotechnical capital as a subset of social  capital in order to highlight the ways in which social and technical components  “jointly influence the ability of people to act together”  p. 249 . He points to six  technological affordances that may affect social capital online, including the ability  to: remove barriers to interaction such as distance and time; expand one’s reach   e.g., sending an email to hundreds of recipients ; restrict information flows via  access controls, which may lower the risks of participation; manage dependencies   e.g., calendar programs ; maintain a history of interactions  e.g., email archives ;  and reify roles or create a group identity through naming. A number of outcomes  derived  from  these  capabilities  have  the  potential  to  enhance  the  individual’s  bridging social capital; for example, it may be easier to maintain relationships with  members  of  one’s  social  network  with  a  smaller  investment  of  time,  provide  coordination  and  support  for  large  groups,  and  make  new  connections  outside   of one’s social network through the Internet. As with Wellman et al.’s  2001   findings,  these  affordances  appear  to  serve  a  supplemental  role,  working  with  other forms of communication to create and maintain social capital.   Resnick points to a need for new measures of sociotechnical capital, as tra- ditional measures of social capital may not reflect the affordances of the tech- nology. One example of this is Williams’  2006  Internet Social Capital Scales   ISCS , which measure bridging and bonding social capital outcomes in online  and offline environments. Williams notes that there are many forms of online  interaction  which  can  often  be  in  conjunction  with  offline  interactions  that  occur  in  person  or  via  other  media,  making  it  difficult  to  assess  the  role  that the Internet plays in social capital development. He proposes new scales  that explicitly measure social capital formation in both online and offline set- tings in order to better assess the tradeoffs between these two contexts.   130    Social Textures  Social Network Sites and Social Capital  One question emerging from Williams’  2006  research on online social capital  measurement considers whether the Internet is more conducive to creating bridg- ing or bonding social capital. He notes that because of the low cost of entry and  relative  anonymity  in  many  online  communities,  the  Internet  may  allow  for  greater bridging outcomes than do offline interactions. However, SNSs’ unique  features and uses may encourage both bridging and bonding outcomes. In con- trast  to  the  anonymous  interactions  between  strangers  on  public  forums,  the  majority  of  connections  on  SNSs  comprise  pre- existing  relationships   Ellison,  Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007 . Furthermore, users are able to provide very detailed  identity information in their profiles, which are rarely anonymous. SNSs provide  for public displays of connections between users via Friend lists, which may help  users expand their networks through shared connections  Donath & boyd, 2004 .   While  the  ability  to  maintain  pre- existing  relationships  may  be  a  strong  motivation for using SNSs, they also enable users to transform latent ties, or  ties which are “technically possible but not yet activated socially”  Haythorn- thwaite, 2005, p. 137 , into weak or strong ties. Latent ties arise whenever a  new  medium  is  introduced  that  allows  for  individuals  to  connect  with  each  other.  SNSs  open  up  new  pathways  of  communication  between  individuals  who otherwise might not have the opportunity to interact with one another.  The importance of transforming latent ties into weak ties is especially relevant  for college students, who are also among the heaviest users of SNSs. For many  students,  the  undergraduate  experience  is  an  opportunity  to  interact  with  more  and  different  kinds  of  individuals  than  they  might  have  encountered  before college. SNS scholars suggest that technological tools such as SNSs may  assist people in maintaining relationships with more individuals  e.g., Donath,  2007; Donath & boyd, 2004 , as these sites simplify the process of communi- cating with and keeping updated on the lives of hundreds—even thousands— of “Friends.” Maintaining a large network of weak ties, and especially bridging  weak ties, has been shown to result in positive outcomes stemming from the  increased access to a diverse set of information  Granovetter, 1983 .   College students who use Facebook may reap the developmental benefits of  this  expanded  social  network   with  more  bridges  to  other  networks   in  the  form of exposure to new and diverse ideas, information, and people. At the  same time, SNSs may also supplement relationships between close friends by  allowing  for  additional  modes  of  communication,  thus  expanding  bonding  social capital. Ellison et al.  2007  found that intensity of Facebook use pre- dicted bonding social capital, and 20% of the SNS users in one study of college  undergraduates believed that their SNS use made them closer to their friends   Subrahmanyam, Reich, Waechter, & Espinoza, 2008 . SNS research tends to    Social Network Sites and Social Capital    131  focus  on  bridging  outcomes  over  bonding  outcomes,  perhaps  because  SNSs’  impact on bonding social capital is likely not as strong due to media multiplex- ity effects  Haythornthwaite, 2005 . In other words, close friends are probably  more likely to make use of multiple methods of interaction  e.g., face- to-face,  phone, texting, Internet  to maintain their relationship than weak ties.  Ties vs. Friends in Social Capital and SNSs  On Facebook, all of a user’s contacts are labeled as “Friends” and there is little  opportunity within the standard profile for users to differentiate between close  friends  and  casual  acquaintances.  This  differs  from  other  SNSs,  such  as  MySpace, which enable users to demarcate their “top 8” contacts. In Decem- ber 2007, Facebook introduced a feature which enabled users to group Friends  into  categories,  but  prior  to  this  all  contacts  were  undifferentiated:  casual  acquaintances, best friends, co- workers, romantic partners—all were labeled  globally as “Friends.” As Fono and Raynes- Goldie  2006  write:  Our findings indicated that the understandings of friendship on the service  were multiple, not just across users, but within individual understandings  as well . . . it is often difficult for two users who both call each other a  friend to know if they are talking about the same thing.   p. 94   danah boyd  2006  similarly notes that a wide range of reasons exist for Friend- ing,  thus  disputing  the  notion  that  users  view  all  “Friends”  as  actual  friends.  Donath  2007  notes that the lack of explicit relationship definitions on SNSs is  not necessarily a problem to be solved, and that oftentimes this ambiguity is pre- ferred in that it can preserve face and reduce social discomfort. Skeptics have  expressed concern about the vernacular of friendship that infuses the site, and  the  high  number  of  friends  reported  on  these  sites  is  concerning  to  some.  As  Brian Boyd  2006  writes, “What does it mean, then, to be on someone’s ‘Buddy  List,’ or to be ‘friended,’ by contrast to what it means to be a friend? And will  the rising generation be able to tell the difference?”  p. 125 .   When considering Friendship and social capital on SNSs, it is important to  note that the concept of social capital is not contingent upon close friendships  and  requires  only  that  a  connection  exist  between  two  individuals  in  a  network. Some types of social capital, like bridging, are difficult to generate  from  close  friends  and  depend  on  a  heterogeneous  set  of  ties  in  a  social  network. Hence, even though SNS users are most likely not close friends with  all of their Friends, especially when connections can number in the hundreds  or even thousands, these ties are likely to provide social capital benefits.   132    Social Textures  A Summary of Facebook Research at MSU  Online Offline Communication and Facebook  Like many SNSs, Facebook provides users with features that support existing  relationships as well as the ability to randomly browse one’s “network”  those  that share a geographical or institutional affiliation  and initiate contact. Some  studies  argue  that  relatively  few  Facebook  connections  begin  online.  Mayer  and Puller  2008  found that only 1% of their sample reported relationships  that  exist  purely  online.  Subrahmanyam  et  al.   2008 ,  however,  report  that  73% of their participants only connected with people they knew in person— implying  that  more  than  one- quarter  of  respondents  do  connect  with  stran- gers. Pew data have shown that 44% of teens with a SNS profile report being  contacted by someone who had no connection to themselves or their friends   Smith, 2007 .   A series of studies at Michigan State University has investigated the issue of  how connections in Facebook originate. Lampe, Ellison, and Steinfield  2006   conducted a survey of first- year undergraduates  n = 1,210  to determine their  attitudes, reported behaviors, and perceived audience regarding Facebook. As  this was early in Facebook’s history, we were interested in probing the extent  to which Facebook use adhered to a Rheingoldian  1993  narrative of online  interaction in which online interactants were largely pseudonymous and used  online  tools  to  find  others  like  them.  Facebook  was  different  in  that  it  was  rooted  in  a  network  structure,  which  grouped  those  who  self- selected  into  geographical  or  institutional  networks,  used  real  names  as  a  default,  and  employed  a  set  of  standardized  and  searchable  profile  fields.  Lampe  et  al.   2006   found  that  students  reported  on  Likert  scales  low  agreement  with  statements like, “I use Facebook to meet new people” and “I use Facebook to  find  people  to  date.”  However,  students  reported  high  levels  of  agreement  with statements like, “I use Facebook to keep in touch with old friends” and “I  use  Facebook  to  check  out  someone  I  met  socially.”  In  addition  to  these  reported  behaviors,  respondents  were  asked  about  who  they  thought  had  looked at their profiles. People who were unlikely to share an offline connec- tion with the respondent, such as strangers, the police, or university adminis- trators  were  seen  as  unlikely  to  have  looked  at  a  profile.  However,  friends  from high school, people from one’s classes, and people one might have met  at a party were all seen as likely to have looked at the respondent’s profile.  We interpreted these findings as support that undergraduate Facebook users  were more likely to be connecting to people with whom they had a previous  connection  usually because of a shared experience like a high school or class   than meeting new people based on shared interest.   Social Network Sites and Social Capital    133    Lampe  et  al.   2007   analyzed  undergraduate  profiles   n = 30,773   and  found that Facebook profile fields that were hard to fake and that allowed users  to create common ground in offline environments  e.g., hometown and high  school vs. preferences like favorite books and movies  were most important in  creating large networks of connections on the site. We interpreted this as sug- gesting  that  users  were  seeking  cues  about  each  other  to  create  common  ground,  and  the  profile  fields  of  Facebook  reduced  the  cost  of  finding  these  commonalities between users. This suggests that Facebook users may be more  likely  to  use  online  information  to  find  others  with  whom  they  share  some  kind  of  offline  connection,  as  opposed  to  finding  others  based  on  common  interests  like  music  or  movies.  In  addition,  it  could  be  that  simply  knowing  you are from the same town as someone else provides common context and  reference points that create common ground, even if you have not previously  interacted with that person in that context. Knowing that you have easy con- versation  topics  like  local  landmarks  or  shared  acquaintances  or  events  may  lower the barriers to future interaction.   The empirical question of how Facebook undergraduates used the site was  probed further in Ellison et al.  2007 . In this survey of a random sample of  MSU undergraduates  n = 286 , we used a simple measure of online to offline  communication and offline to online communication, finding that our survey  respondents engaged in significantly more Facebook use involving people with  whom  they  shared  an  offline  connection,  such  as  an  existing  friend,  a  class- mate, someone living near them, or someone they met socially  mean = 3.64  on  a  scale  ranging  from  1 = very  unlikely  to  5 = very  likely ,  than  use  that  involved meeting new people  mean = 1.97 .   In a recent study, we used longitudinal data to explore changes in these pat- terns of interaction over time. Lampe, Ellison, and Steinfield  2008  surveyed  random  samples  of  MSU’s  undergraduate  student  population  from  2006  through 2008 regarding their use of and attitudes toward Facebook. In each of  the cross- sectional surveys, we found that respondents showed similar behav- iors  and  attitudes  over  time.  Specifically,  in  each  year  respondents  reported  low agreement with statements like, “I use Facebook to meet new people” or  “I use Facebook to find people to date” and high agreement with statements  like, “I use Facebook to keep in touch with old friends” and “I use Facebook to  check out people I meet socially.” Also, the sense of audience for one’s profile  remained  constant.  Peers,  such  as  friends  from  high  school  and  people  in  classes, were seen as likely to have viewed the respondent’s profile, and non-  peers like professors and law- enforcement were seen as unlikely to have done  so. Between 2006 and 2007 we saw strong increases in numbers of friends and  number of minutes per day on Facebook, as well as increases in reports of sat- isfaction with Facebook. We attribute at least part of this increase to the News    134    Social Textures  Feed,  which  reduced  the  cost  of  maintaining  large,  dispersed  networks  of  friends by providing users with a continually updating stream of their Friends’  actions on the site. Hence, the evidence from our studies strongly supports the  notion that Facebook is used predominantly to articulate connections that have  some basis offline.  The Role of Facebook in Generating Social Capital  A second prominent theme of our research has been the social capital implica- tions  of  Facebook  use.  We’ve  conducted  a  series  of  studies  examining  how  Facebook  use  relates  to  various  forms  of  social  capital  among  students,  attempting to tease out whether the effect is specifically related to Facebook,  or Internet use in general, as well as whether the evidence supports a causal  explanation or is more consistent with the argument that those having more  social capital simply have more reason to use Facebook.   Ellison et al.  2007  assessed levels of social capital and Facebook use in an  undergraduate  student  population,  finding  that  students’  Facebook  use  was  significantly related to their levels of social capital. We examined three kinds  of social capital—bridging, bonding, and maintained. Bridging social capital,  as  described  above,  describes  the  benefits  associated  with  weak  ties,  such  as  access to novel information, and was measured using five items derived from  Williams  2006 , as well as three additional items intended to assess outcomes  of bridging social capital in the MSU context. Bonding social capital is associ- ated with close ties and was measured using five items developed and validated  by  Williams   2006 .  Maintained  social  capital  was  assessed  using  an  original  scale, which included items such as, “I’d be able to find information about a  job or internship from a high school acquaintance” and “If I needed to, I could  ask a high school acquaintance to do a small favor for me.” These items were  constructed in light of pilot interview data that suggested one of the primary  uses of Facebook for undergraduates was keeping in touch with people from  high school.   Ellison et al.  2007  report regression analyses showing that, after control- ling  for  demographic  variables  and  general  Internet  use,  Facebook  Intensity2  emerged as a significant predictor of all three forms of social capital, with the  largest effect demonstrated on bridging social capital. We also found an inter- esting interaction effect with self- esteem, such that those with low self- esteem  seemed to accrue more bridging social capital from their Facebook use than  those with higher self- esteem.   This question was revisited, using panel data, in order to gain more insight  into  the  directionality  of  the  relationship  between  Facebook  use  and  social  capital   Steinfield,  Ellison,  &  Lampe,  2008 .  Based  on  a  panel  of  92  cases    Social Network Sites and Social Capital    135  surveyed in April of 2006 and again in April 2007, we investigated the lagged  relationships between Facebook Intensity  FBI  and bridging social capital. The  within- year  relationships  remained  strong  from  one  year  to  the  next   RFBI_2006–BSC_2006 = 0.46;  RFBI_2007–BSC_2007 = 0.35 ,  but  these  do  not  reveal  directionality.  The  difference  in  lagged  relationships  was  telling,  however   RFBI_2006–BSC_2007 = 0.48;  RBSC_2006–FBI_2007 = 0.14 .  Those  with  greater  social  capital in 2006 did not necessarily use Facebook more intensively a year later,  while those who used Facebook more intensively in 2006 reported higher bridg- ing social capital a year later. These results held up in lagged regression analyses,  even after controlling for demographic factors and general Internet use.   These two studies establish an empirical relationship between Facebook use  and social capital. A further finding in both studies was the heightened impact  of Facebook use on bridging social capital for students who scored lower on  self- esteem  scales.  Interaction  analyses  in  both  studies  revealed  that  those  lower in self- esteem reported greater benefit in terms of bridging social capital  from  their  Facebook  use  than  those  with  higher  self- esteem.  Moreover,  this  effect  held  up  over  time  in  the  second  study.  This  suggests  to  us  that  the  affordances of a SNS like Facebook may be helping those who might otherwise  have difficulty connecting with diverse others.  Communication Patterns and Social Capital  In  order  to  better  assess  the  relationship  between  online offline  interaction  patterns  and  outcomes  of  use—specifically  social  capital—we  attempted  to  develop a series of scales that measured how various individuals used the site  to  learn  more  about  others.  In  Ellison,  Steinfield,  and  Lampe   2009 ,  we  report  on  survey  data   n = 450   that  explicitly  address  the  question  of  how  undergraduates are using the site, and the social capital implications of these  communication  practices.  The  instrument  includes  a  series  of  items  asking  respondents to indicate how likely they were to engage in a range of possible  behaviors  browse the Facebook profile, contact via Facebook, add as a Face- book  friend,  and  meet  face- to-face   with  three  types  of  individuals:  a  total  stranger, someone from one’s residence hall, and a close friend. Our instru- ment  also  included  several  items  gauging  the  extent  to  which  Facebook  was  used  for  various  social  purposes,  derived  from  items  used  in  Ellison  et  al.   2007 . Through factor analysis, we identified three distinct sets of behaviors:   	  Initiating: This scale assessed the use of Facebook to meet strangers or make  new friends. Items include all four of the online offline behaviors  brows- ing,  contacting,  Friending,  and  meeting  face- to-face   in  relation  to  MSU  strangers, as well as one other item, “I use Facebook to meet new people.”   136    Social Textures   	   	 Maintaining: This scale refers to the use of Facebook to maintain existing  close ties. It includes all four of the online offline behaviors in relation to  close friends. Information- seeking: This scale measures use of the site for learning more  about people with whom the user has some offline connection. It includes  three items about how the site is used  “I have used Facebook to check out  someone  I  met  socially”;  “I  use  Facebook  to  learn  more  about  other  people in my classes”; “I use Facebook to learn more about other people  living  near  me”   and  one  item  probing  the  likelihood  of  browsing  the  profile of someone in their residence hall.  With a mean of 1.87 on a five- point Likert scale  where 1 = very unlikely and  5 = very likely , initiating was the least common strategy reported by respond- ents, while maintaining, with a mean of 4.67, was the highest, thus providing  additional support for earlier work that suggested using the site to connect with  existing  or  latent  ties  was  more  common  than  using  it  to  meet  strangers.  Notably, regression analyses revealed that only the information- seeking connec- tion strategy was a significant predictor of bridging and bonding social capital.  Additionally, for this work we asked about what percentage of the respondents’  total Facebook “Friends” were actual friends. The number of “actual” friends on  the site was predictive of the existence of social capital, but the total number of  friends was not. These findings suggest that individuals who used Facebook to  discover  information  about  latent  ties,  rather  than  engage  in  indiscriminate  “friend collecting,” were more likely to accrue social capital from their use of  the site. We will continue to explore these relationships in future work.  Mechanisms of Social Capital Generation in Social  Network Sites  Taken as a whole, our research suggests two trends. First, use of Facebook by  undergraduate students in our samples is associated with higher levels of bridg- ing and bonding social capital, and Facebook use appears to precede these gains  in social capital, suggesting a causal relationship. Second, users are more likely  to use the site to connect with existing friends, distant acquaintances, or latent  ties than they are to use the site to meet new people. Additionally, using the  site to research or find out about people with whom they have some kind of  offline connection  but don’t already know well  is a significant predictor of  social  capital.  In  this  final  section,  we  describe  the  mechanism  by  which  we  believe these sets of findings are related.   As Burt  2005  argues, social capital is embedded in the structure of social  networks  and  the  location  of  individuals  within  these  structures.  Social    Social Network Sites and Social Capital    137  networks  are  not  all  shaped  alike,  and  the  shape  of  the  network  affects  the  promulgation  of  social  capital.  Social  networks  that  are  comprised  of  small  clusters  of  people  who  all  know  one  another  are  going  to  accrue  different  benefits than networks where individuals have more diffuse connections with a  large set of distant ties. We believe the key way in which Facebook serves to  support the generation of social capital is through reshaping the social network  of individuals and by lowering the costs of communicating with  and thus con- tributing to and extracting benefits from  this social network.   One way of conceptualizing the effect of Facebook use on social capital is  by  considering  the  relationship  between  physical  proximity  and  relationship  development.  Research  on  proximity  has  long  suggested  that  proximity  between two individuals increases the chances that a relationship will form.3  Friendships  often  form  based  on  where  one  lives,  works,  attends  school,  or  spends leisure time, in part because there are more opportunities for commu- nication   Kraut,  Fussell,  Brennan,  &  Siegel,  2002b;  Neckerman,  1996   and  because  proximity  decreases  the  effort  required  to  initiate  a  relationship   Kraut  et  al.,  2002b .  Facebook  extends  these  proximity- based  social  proc- esses  in  two  ways.  First,  it  allows  those  who  formed  a  relationship  through  physical proximity, but subsequently lost that proximity, to maintain the rela- tionship. High school students moving to college, people shifting jobs, or fam- ilies  moving  are  all  examples  of  this.  Second,  Facebook  can  reinforce  relationships  formed  through  proximity  that  would  be  too  ephemeral  to  survive otherwise. For example, two students who meet through a class may  connect  for  the  duration  of  the  class  because  of  the  forced  proximity.  However, when that proximity is removed, the relationship may not survive  the  sudden  increased  cost  of  maintenance.  Facebook  makes  it  easy  to  keep  lightweight contact with each other even when the benefits of proximity are  no longer available.4 Facebook enables individuals to maintain a larger set of weak ties. As described by    Donath  2007  and Donath and boyd  2004 , SNSs can be “social supernets” in  that they increase the number of weak ties a user can maintain, thus expanding  the range of available information sources. This kind of social network, which  consists of casual acquaintances and close friends, is well suited for supporting  ad- hoc advice- seeking. Larger heterogeneous networks of strong and weak ties  are more likely to include diverse individuals who share a tangential connec- tion, but can also serve as resources for new information. Additionally, some  SNSs  enable  “friends  of  friends”  to  interact,  thus  exposing  users  to  an  even  more diverse set of weak ties. In addition to the access to new information and  perspectives these weak ties may provide, learning how to manage, speak to,  and engage with the conflicting opinions that diverse others represent is a valu- able skill set which may result in social capital outcomes  Burt, 2009 .   138    Social Textures    Facebook  allows  individuals  to  make  ephemeral  connections  persistent.  In  our  everyday lives, we frequently encounter people with whom we might want to  reconnect at some point in the future, but often the social or logistical barriers  to  do  so  are  too  high.  The  potential  benefits  of  staying  in  touch  are  over- whelmed by the costs of coordination, making it unlikely that the connection  persists. In the professional realm, proximity in workspaces leads to successful  collaborations  because  repeat  chance  encounters  encourage  individuals  to  develop common ground and thus nurture a nascent relationship  Kraut et al.,  2002b . But for chance encounters, especially when there are no immediate  and significant perceived benefits, we often don’t make the effort to coordi- nate re- connecting once the encounter is over. For example, participants at a  workshop, members of a club, students in a class, or parents at a playground  are all examples of connections that in the face- to-face context, bounded by  limitations of proximity, are ephemeral and often lost.   SNSs can help ameliorate this problem. Using SNSs, a profile can be located  and  reconnections  made  possible.  SNSs  facilitate  interaction,  both  at  that  moment and  assuming a friend request is initiated  in the future. The connec- tion between two individuals can be digitally reconstituted at any time, should  the  need  or  desire  arise.  When  both  parties  use  an  SNS  to  connect,  the  coordination costs become lower because these tools enable active  e.g., mes- saging  and passive  e.g., status updates  communication with very little effort.   Facebook lowers the cost of maintaining  or re- engaging  weak ties. A similar process  occurs  when  we  use  SNSs  to  connect  with  people  from  our  past,  a  dominant  strategy in SNS use. For example, college students often use Facebook to main- tain contact with high school friends. Increasingly, older populations coming to  Facebook reconnect with high school and college friends with whom they’ve lost  touch, but have found again using the features of Facebook. These acquaintances  and friends or contacts from the past are likely to be different from us and thus  provide  us  with  valuable  new  information,  ideas,  and  perspectives.  The  affordances of SNSs, namely the ability to easily track changes in the lives of these  individuals  and  to  inform  them  of  one’s  own  activities,  helps  with  relationship  maintenance and lowers the barriers for future contact. By being connected to  people less likely to be like us, and by maintaining lightweight  weak  social ties  with those individuals, opportunities to generate bridging social capital increase.   Facebook profiles can lower the barriers to initial interaction and facilitate formation of  common ground. The fields included in the profile vary from SNS to SNS, but typ- ically include the ability to display photographs, list contact information, and to  describe personal characteristics such as music preferences and other taste indic- ators  boyd & Ellison, 2007; Liu, 2007 . Access to personal identity information  can  support  relationship- formation.  For  instance,  in  the  workplace,  profile  information  can  help  people  engage  in  “people  sensemaking,”  the  process  of    Social Network Sites and Social Capital    139  understanding “who someone is and to determine how and why that user should  interact with someone”  DiMicco & Millen, 2008, p. 1 . Personal information  such as updates about family members or travel plans may spark conversations,  replicating the spontaneous exchanges of information associated with proximity   Kraut et al., 2002b .   The identity information in the profile assists individuals in finding common  ground and thus facilitates communication and coordination processes  Olson &  Olson,  2001 .  Clark  and  Brennan   1991   write  that  individuals  “cannot  even  begin  to  coordinate  on  content  without  assuming  a  vast  amount  of  shared  information  or  common  ground—that  is,  mutual  knowledge,  mutual  beliefs,  and mutual assumptions. . . . All collective actions are built on common ground  and its accumulation”  p. 127 . Among distributed individuals, the lack of visual  cues can make establishing common ground more challenging  Kiesler & Cum- mings, 2002 ; for these individuals, profile content can help broker interactions,  reduce friction, and facilitate more effective communication processes. Previous  scholarship on SNSs suggests that profile information in Facebook may help users  find common ground with one another  DiMicco & Millen, 2007; Lampe et al.,  2007 .  SNS  profiles  are  less  likely  to  contain  the  deceptive  self- presentation  sometimes  found  in  other  online  contexts,  such  as  online  dating  sites   Toma,  Hancock, & Ellison, 2008 , because the visible social network serves as a warrant  for users’ profile content  Walther, Van Der Heide, Hamel, & Shulman, 2009   and increases the trustworthiness of self- presentation in SNSs  Donath, 2007 .   Facebook makes it easier to seek information and support from one’s social network,  and to provide these resources to others. Communication between Facebook Friends  is facilitated by the site, and the transaction costs  Williamson, 1981  associated  with online and offline interaction are lowered due to the communication fea- tures of the site and because offline contact information is often included in pro- files. It is unlikely that individuals use Facebook to discover large numbers of  new close friends, but the site effectively facilitates the ability to ask for  and  receive   emotional  support  from  strong  and  weak  ties  and  supports  acts  of  “social grooming”  Donath, 2007; Tufekci, 2008 . In our own use of Facebook,  we’ve  seen  individuals  suffering  from  chronic  health  problems  update  their  status with explicit statements marking pain or depression, and receiving public  comments of support and sympathy  and, most likely, private notes as well .  Future Research Directions  In the future, we plan to extend this line of inquiry to other populations and  contexts, in order to discover how generalizable these findings are. Prelimi- nary  work  suggests  that  social  capital  benefits  can  result  in  work  settings  outside the university. In a survey of IBM employees using Beehive, an internal    140    Social Textures  SNS,  we  found  that  greater  SNS  use  was  associated  with  such  outcomes  as  greater bonding social capital, more access to both new people and expertise  in the company, a greater willingness to contribute to the company in terms of  citizenship, and a stronger interest in global connections  Steinfield, DiMicco,  Ellison,  &  Lampe,  2009 .  Recent  Pew  survey  data  reinforce  the  notion  that  SNS  use  is  associated  with  more  diverse  social  networks  among  the  general  U.S.  population   Hampton,  Sessions,  Her,  &  Rainie,  2009 .  In  short,  while  many of the practices and outcomes we’ve identified are likely to be seen in  other  populations,  more  work  needs  to  be  done  to  understand  how  these  social  capital  mechanisms  operate  among  older  populations  and  younger  people outside the college undergraduate population.   We also plan to refine our measurement of social capital and communication  practices. Social capital is notoriously hard to measure, and while our scales are  reliable, they are limited in that they assess psychological orientation and feelings,  not  actual  outcomes  of  use.  We  plan  to  develop  additional  scales  that  include  other dimensions of social capital. Additionally, we plan on using other methods  for assessing social capital that are based on behavioral data, such as content analy- sis of actual site postings that display characteristics of social capital in action  e.g.,  requests for advice or assistance . Analysis of server- level data is another neces- sary step for making claims about the extent to which Facebook or other SNSs  support social capital and the mechanisms by which this might happen.   Another area we intend to explore is the measurement of social ties. There  is a range of relationships that are currently enacted on SNSs, and we need to  develop measures to capture these nuances and go beyond notions of weak and  strong ties. Our “information- seeking” strategy may be the first step in under- standing the ways in which latent ties are exploited on these sites, but these  variables should be subjected to more rigorous testing. For instance, because  we didn’t include measures of offline, traditional information- seeking in our  instrument,  we  cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  that  individuals  who  score  higher  on  our  Facebook  information- seeking  measures  also  engage  in  this  activity in other contexts, and that this, rather than Facebook- specific behav- ior,  is  responsible  for  the  social  capital  changes  we  have  observed.  Future  research should address these limitations.   Finally, a promising line of future research could explore the ways in which  specific features and the design of SNSs affect social capital and other outcomes.  Friendship in Facebook is bi- directional  both parties must agree , whereas other  sites  enable  relationships  that  are  asymmetrical.  For  example,  Twitter  enables  individuals to “follow” others who may not follow them. While this design may  encourage individuals to access content from a broader network  thus increasing  bridging social capital , it may have implications for the ways in which reciprocity  norms are enacted if information flow is one- directional. One hypothesis is that    Social Network Sites and Social Capital    141  greater use of Twitter can build bridging social capital due to the increased expo- sure to new information, but would be less likely to impact bonding social capital.  Hence the design of the site may result in different types of relational interaction,  and subsequent social capital outcomes. More research is needed into the way in  which design features, such as asymmetrical ties, affect social capital outcomes.  Conclusion  We do not mean to suggest that all SNS activity is positive or results in social  capital. There are potential negative outcomes of many of the processes and fea- tures we mention above. For instance, personal information about others may be  used to broker productive interaction, but it could also reinforce existing stereo- types, making them more intractable, or may be misused by marketing agents or  used for nefarious purposes such as stalking, bullying, and identity theft. There  are many who may not be taking advantage of the opportunities provided by these  sites, as has been illustrated by work on digital inequities  Hargittai, 2008 .   Overall, however, we believe there is potential for positive social outcomes  resulting from SNS use, and Facebook is a tool that facilitates specific types of  connections between people that can generate social capital. The technical and  social affordances of these sites allow users to maintain broader, more diverse  social  networks,  keep  social  ties  they  may  have  lost  in  other  situations,  and  interact  with  a  diverse  set  of  contacts  using  online  tools.  These  outcomes  of  SNS  use  will  have  benefits  we  can  only  guess  at  in  the  long  run,  but  already  we’ve seen positive effects on social capital among both university students and  workers in an enterprise setting  Steinfield et al., 2009 . SNSs are continuously  reshaping our social networks and the communication practices we use to main- tain them, and thus constitute a vibrant, important, and challenging context for  studying communication practices and their social capital outcomes.  Notes  1.  Following boyd and Ellison  2007 , we capitalize Friends when we are referring to  online connections in order to distinguish them from colloquial notions of tradi- tional friendship.  2.  The Facebook Intensity measure  Ellison et al., 2007  combines psychological and  usage items in order to assess how integrated Facebook is into the daily routines of  a user and other indications of psychological affiliation. FBI consists of the follow- ing six items as well as number of friends and daily minutes on the site:  	 Facebook	is	part	of	my	everyday	activity.  	 I	am	proud	to	tell	people	I’m	on	Facebook.  	 Facebook	has	become	part	of	my	daily	routine.  	 I	feel	out	of	touch	when	I	haven’t	logged	on	to	Facebook	for	a	while.   142    Social Textures   	 I	feel	I	am	part	of	the	Facebook	community.  	 I	would	be	sorry	if	Facebook	shut	down.  3.  Verbrugge  1977  notes that spatial proximity is one of the likely prerequisites of  friendship  formation  among  adults.  Similarly,  research  on  friendship  patterns  among adolescents has reaffirmed the important role of proximity in shaping these  social  relationships   Neckerman,  1996   and  campus  residential  location  affects  friendship formation patterns among college students  Foster, 2005 .  4.  Other  SNSs  may  function  as  a  kind  of  proxy  for  proximity  because,  like  shared  spaces, they allow individuals to come together based on shared interests or demo- graphics.  SNSs  like  BlackPlanet  and  AsianAvenue  have  long  been  places  where  individuals with shared cultural backgrounds gather. Sites like Ning now allow for  the  creation  of  “micro- SNSs,”  where  people  with  shared  interests  ranging  from  trout  fishing  to  band  appreciation  to  alumni  groups  can  gather.  The  ability  to  include  interests  and  characteristics  in  the  SNS  profile  may  allow  for  a  type  of  “proximity”  that  also  extends  the  physical  environment  and  enables  distributed  groups to form. Although our research on Facebook suggests that it is not typically  used  to  make  connections  purely  on  shared  interest,  other  SNSs  have  different  social and technical features that may promote these kinds of formations.

Chapter 7 From Dabblers to Omnivores A Typology of Social Network Site  Usage1  Eszter Hargittai and Yu- li Patrick Hsieh  Introduction  Social network sites  SNSs  have become some of the most popular online des- tinations  in  recent  years   comScore,  2009   and  accordingly  have  started  to  attract the attention of academic researchers  see boyd & Ellison, 2007, for a  review of related literature, as well as other chapters in this volume . Despite  the upsurge in related work, most current investigations tend to look at SNS  usage as an either- or phenomenon by focusing on the use of just one such site  or, alternatively, investigating the use of any such site at any level of engage- ment  e.g., Jones, Millermaier, Goya- Martinez, & Schuler, 2008; Ross, Orr,  Sisic,  Arseneault,  Simmering,  &  Orr,  2009;  Steinfield,  Ellison,  &  Lampe,  2008; Tong, Van Der Heide, Langwell, & Walther, 2008 . But is it justifiable  to  assume  that  there  is  no  difference  among  users  in  intensity  of  their  SNS  usage  or  that  such  variation  is  inconsequential  for  questions  exploring  the  implications  of  SNS  uses?  It  is  this  gap  in  the  literature  that  this  chapter  addresses  both  theoretically  and  empirically.  We  put  forward  a  typology  of  SNS usage that takes into consideration both frequency and diversity of SNS  uses, the combination of which we refer to as “SNS use intensity.” We then  apply  this  framework  to  an  empirical  example  of  SNS  usage  intensity  in  a  community.   How do users differ in their engagement with SNSs ? Are there systematic  differences among frequent and occasional users of such sites? Is there a differ- ence among those who are loyal to one SNS only compared to those who are  actively  involved  with  several?  The  lack  of  data  on  details  of  SNS  usage  has  made it difficult for researchers to ask such nuanced questions about this topic.  Here, thanks to a unique data set based on a survey administered to a diverse  group of young adults with sufficiently detailed information about their SNS  uses, we are able to explore answers to these questions. Findings suggest that  intensity of SNS use varies among the group. While some people use only one    A Typology of Social Network Site Use    147  site  and  do  so  only  occasionally,  others  use  one  SNS  often  while  yet  others  engage with numerous sites regularly. Moreover, level of engagement is not  randomly distributed across the sample. Rather, a person’s gender, context of  Internet  use  and  online  experiences  are  all  associated  with  level  of  SNS  use  intensity. The results suggest the importance of more nuanced approaches to  the study of SNS uses than has been traditionally the case.  Research on Social Network Site Uses  Social  network  sites  have  become  some  of  the  most  popular  online  services  since  the  early  2000s   comScore,  2009 .  Users  create  an  online  profile  on  these sites by listing personal information and interests, linking up with other  users  of  the  site,  and  sharing,  often  daily,  updates  about  their  thoughts  and  activities  with  those  in  their  networks   boyd  &  Ellison,  2007 .  Given  their  significant rise in popularity, it is not surprising that these sites and how people  use them has attracted much scholarly attention in recent years. Several papers  were published in a special issue of the Journal of Computer- Mediated Communica- tion  in  2007  dedicated  to  investigating  various  aspects  of  SNSs.  Its  editors,  boyd and Ellison  2007 , review early scholarship in this domain, identifying  four  main  research  areas:   1   impression  management,  friendship  perform- ance,  and  identity  construction;   2   networks  and  network  structure;   3   online offline  social  networks  and  social  capital;  and   4   concerns  about  privacy. This body of work finds that many people who use SNSs have started  to integrate them into their everyday lives as a common daily practice. Con- sequently,  SNS  use  may  start  to  challenge  some  existing  social  conventions  such  as  approaches  to  privacy,  the  way  some  people  construct  their  self-  identity, and how people interact with one another in their daily lives. Accord- ingly, it is important to have a better understanding of the possible variation in  the extent to which different people use such sites for an appreciation of how  their different uses may influence social practices.   In  the  past  few  years,  there  has  been  continued  rapid  growth  in  SNS  research exploring earlier questions in more detail, asking new questions, and  doing so through the use of an increasingly diverse set of methodologies. In  studies  of  computer- mediated  communication   CMC ,  some  scholars  have  employed  various  perspectives  to  conceptualize  and  empirically  investigate  impression  management  and  identity  construction  on  SNSs   e.g.,  Goodings,  Locke, & Brown, 2007; Walther, Van Der Heide, Hamel, & Shulman, 2009;  Walther, Van Der Heide, Kim, Westerman, & Tong, 2008; Zhao, Grasmuck,  & Martin, 2008 . For example, Walther and colleagues found that the content  on  one’s  Facebook  friends’  profiles  rather  than  the  content  on  one’s  own  profile affects how others perceive a user on Facebook. Empirical analyses of    148    Social Textures  profiles on MySpace  Goodings, Locke, & Brown, 2007  and Facebook  Zhao,  Grasmuck,  &  Martin,  2008   have  found  that,  due  to  some  relatively  unique  features of SNSs compared to previous online spaces, the practices of identity  construction  on  them  are  different  from  anonymous  online  environments.  Unlike  in  some  other  online  spaces,  on  SNSs,  users’  identities  are  often  anchored  in  physical  proximities,  institutions,  and  shared  personal  relation- ships in daily life, thereby often mirroring offline aspects of people’s lives.   Researchers have also started to look at the properties of Facebook users’  friendship networks and their implications  e.g., Lewis, Kaufman, Gonzalez,  Wimmer, & Christakis, 2008; Seder & Oishi, 2009; Tong et al., 2008 . For  example,  in  their  experimental  study  of  online  impression  formation,  Tong  and  colleagues  found  a  complex  non- linear  relationship  between  the  total  number of friends on an individual’s profile  i.e., network size  and the per- son’s  perceived  attractiveness  and  perceived  extraversion.  Racial  and  ethnic  homogeneity of personal networks on these sites is another question that has  attracted  scholarly  attention.  Researchers  have  found  that  White  Facebook  users may have more ethnically and racially homogeneous friendship networks  than others on the site  Lewis et al., 2008; Seder & Oishi, 2009 .   Some  scholars  have  directly  addressed  moral  panics  introduced  in  main- stream  media  about  the  possible  detrimental  consequences  of  using  SNSs   Bahney,  2006;  Hope,  2009;  Leake  &  Warren,  2009;  Nussbaum,  2007;  Roush,  2006 .  Such  academic  research  tends  to  suggest  that  empirical  evid- ence  rarely  supports  overarching  fears  about  the  social  and  psychological  implications of using such sites  Hinduja & Patchin, 2008; Jones et al., 2008;  Livingstone, 2008; Pasek, more, & Hargittai, 2009 . Other researchers in this  domain have focused on exploring the factors that explain different patterns in  SNS  use  and  adoption  such  as  gender,  personality,  and  motivations   Barker,  2009;  Joinson,  2008;  Lampe,  Ellison,  &  Steinfield,  2008;  Pfeil,  Arjan,  &  Zaphiris, 2009; Ross et al., 2009; Seder & Oishi, 2009; Steinfield et al., 2008;  Zywica & Danowski, 2008 . While some of the more recent work has started  to consider level of engagement with SNSs  e.g., Barker, 2009; Joinson, 2008;  Steinfield  et  al.,  2008 ,  no  systematic  approach  has  so  far  been  put  forth  to  address  the  question  of  use  intensity  despite  the  fact  that  level  and  types  of  usage  likely  have  repercussions  for  how  SNS  usage  fits  into  and  impacts  people’s lives.  Frequency and Diversity of Social Network Site  Uses  As noted above, the academic literature on SNS uses has covered considerable  ground despite being a relatively new area of inquiry. Here, we are especially    A Typology of Social Network Site Use    149  interested in work that has considered frequency and diversity of SNS usage.  These aspects of use may reflect actual differences in how people are incorpo- rating these services into their lives and possible consequences resulting from  their uses. Accordingly, they may be problematic to ignore in studies of SNSs.   Some recent scholarship has started to look at SNS usage in more nuanced  ways by considering such factors as frequency of use. One example of work  that has considered frequency of use is Joinson’s  2008  two- stage approach to  studying motivations for, and interest in, using Facebook. The researcher was  interested  in  explaining  different  levels  of  Facebook  use  and  operationalized  the concept in the following two ways: the amount of time spent on and the  frequency  of  visits  to  the  site  during  an  average  week.  Joinson  found  that  female respondents, on average, visited Facebook more often than males, but  once  on  the  site,  there  was  no  gender  difference  in  how  much  time  people  spent on it.   While Joinson  2008  was interested in explaining frequency of use, i.e.,  this  was  the  dependent  variables  in  his  study,  others  have  considered  this  aspect of usage as an explanatory factor, i.e., as independent variables, while  focusing on other outcomes in their analyses  Barker, 2009; Steinfield et al.,  2008 . For example, in her study of college students’ motivations for using  SNSs,  Barker   2009   included  frequency  of  SNS  use  in  her  analyses  meas- ured by a variable constructed from answers to questions about both number  of visits to SNSs and amount of time spent on such a site  measures similar  to those employed by Joinson, 2008, cited above . Barker defined this latter  measure, however, as a global estimate of SNS usage, not accounting for any  specific information about particular sites visited. She found a gender differ- ence in motivations of SNS usage with female students and those possessing  stronger group identity using SNSs more frequently for communicative and  entertainment  motivations  than  others.  Despite  having  included  the  fre- quency  measure  in  her  survey  of  first- year  college  students,  she  did  not  analyze it or interpret its association with other variables in the paper, so we  do not know whether this measure is related to the outcomes of interest in  her project. In their study of social- capital formation through Facebook use, Steinfield    and colleagues  2008  developed a “Facebook Intensity scale” as an important  explanatory variable when looking at how Facebook use may predict changes  in users’ social capital. This measure is based on data about daily time spent on  the  site,  total  number  of  Facebook  friends,  and  a  series  of  attitudinal  items  assessing “the degree to which the respondent felt emotionally connected to  Facebook  and  the  extent  to  which  Facebook  was  integrated  into  daily  activ- ities”  Steinfield et al., 2008, p. 439 . The authors found that intensity of use  leads to increases in bridging social capital. This finding lends support to the    150    Social Textures  central idea of this chapter: that it is limiting to consider SNS usage as a simple  binary variable separating users from non- users; rather, it is important to look  at level of engagement with such sites when considering their implications.   As  the  above  studies  suggest,  some  scholars  have  started  to  consider  fre- quency of SNS usage in their work. However, neither the studies reviewed in  this  section  nor  other  research  in  this  domain  has  looked  at  the  diversity  of  social network site usage  i.e., the number of different such sites respondents  use . The prevailing approach seems to be to look at the use of just one such  service  e.g., see Pfeil et al., 2009, for MySpace and Steinfield et al., 2008,  for Facebook  with a possible underlying implication that findings about their  uses are interchangeable. However, work has shown that these sites attract dif- ferent  communities   Hargittai,  2007 ,  they  also  have  different  designs,  they  allow  for  varied  functionality  and  affordances,  and  so  generalizing  findings  from  one  to  others  may  be  problematic.  For  example,  while  some  sites  are  mainly  used  for  social  relationship  maintenance   e.g.,  Facebook ,  others  are  more  likely  for  the  cultivation  of  professional  networks   e.g.,  LinkedIn .  Given the increasing number and prevalence of SNSs and differences in how  much time people spend online on various activities more generally speaking   e.g., Fallows, 2004; Howard & Jones, 2004; Wellman & Haythornthwaite,  2002 , it seems problematic to collapse all SNS users into one group. It may  pose a challenge to generalize findings about one site’s usage to another and  thereby ignore specifics about types of site uses in investigations. To address  this shortcoming of the literature, we propose a typology of SNS usage that  takes the diversity of SNSs used into account.  Typology of Social Network Site Uses  To refine scholarly approaches to the study of SNS uses, we propose taking  into consideration both the frequency with which users visit such sites and the  number of SNSs with which people engage on a regular basis. This approach  yields  a  two- by-two  matrix  of  SNS  engagement  presented  in  Figure  7.1.  Those  who  only  use  one  such  site  and  do  so  only  sometimes  are  Dabblers.  Those who visit more than one SNS, but none of them often, are Samplers.  Users who are active often on one such site only are Devotees. Finally, those  who are visitors to more than one such site and use at least one of them often  are Omnivores. Dabblers are the least engaged group of the four. Samplers  are  not  active  on  any  particular  SNS,  but  spend  time  on  more  than  one  so  their engagement is likely higher than that of Dabblers. Devotees only engage  with one such service, but do so often. Omnivores have embraced SNSs the  most by using a diversity of them and spending considerable time on at least  one such service.

Methods  Data Collection  College students in the U.S. constitute an ideal population for studying differ- ences  in  digital  media  uses  given  their  high  Internet  connectivity  levels.  Accordingly,  the  analyses  presented  here  are  based  on  data  representing  a  diverse group of mainly 18- and 19-year- old college students. The data collec- tion was conducted in February and March of 2007 at the University of Illi- nois, Chicago, which is a U.S. urban public research university.2 U.S. News and  World Report  2006  ranked this campus among the top- 10 national universities  regarding  campus  ethnic  diversity,  suggesting  that  this  school  offers  an  ideal  location  for  studying  how  different  kinds  of  people  use  online  sites  and  services.   There is one course on this campus that is required of all students: the First-  Year Writing Program. Surveying students based on enrollment in this course  ensures that there is no selection bias among study participants. Out of the 87  sections offered as part of this course, the survey was administered in 85 sec- tions,  constituting  a  98%  participation  rate  on  the  part  of  course  sections.  Overall, there was a final response rate of 82% based on all of the students  enrolled in the course. In order to control for time in the program, this article  focuses on the 1,060 students in the first- year class.3   The  survey  was  administered  on  paper  instead  of  online.  Relying  on  an  online questionnaire when studying Internet uses could create a bias toward  people  who  spend  more  time  on  the  Web,  given  that  they  may  be  more  inclined to fill out the questionnaire and also, perhaps, more inclined toward  higher  rates  of  participation  on  the  sites  of  research  interest.  The  survey  included  detailed  questions  about  respondents’  Internet  uses   e.g.,  experi- ence,  types  of  sites  visited,  and  online  activities   as  well  as  people’s  demo- graphic background in addition to a number of other questions.   152    Social Textures  Independent Variables  We  measure  basic  demographic  information  using  standard  modes  of  opera- tionalization.  Students  were  asked  their  year  of  birth  and  this  information  is  used to calculate their age, which is included in the models as a continuous vari- able.  Male  is  the  base  gender  category   male = 0,  female = 1 .  Information  about race and ethnicity was collected using the U.S. 2000 Census Bureau ques- tionnaire format  U.S. Census Bureau, 2001 , and dummy variables are used in  the statistical models, with White as the base category. Consistent with work  by others, parental education is used as a measure of socioeconomic status  e.g.,  Carlson, Uppal, & Prosser, 2000 . This information is included in the model as  dummy variables, with some high school education or less as the base.   We  collected  data  about  students’  living  situation  as  well  as  the  context  of  their Internet uses given that social context of use has been shown to matter in  how people use the medium  Frohlich & Kraut, 2003; Hassani, 2006 . Both the  question about living at home with parents and the question about having access  to the Internet at a friend’s or family member’s home is included as a binary vari- able,  where  1  signals  affirmative  and  0  stands  for  negative.  Regarding  Internet  experiences, we asked about how much time respondents spend online and calcu- lated hours spent on the Web per week, excluding time spent on email, chat, and  voice  services.  We  also  asked  how  long  they  have  been  using  the  Internet  and  have a measure with number of years online. Figures for both of these are logged  in the analyses given that an additional hour or year, respectively, likely has dimin- ishing returns as the values increase. Also, following Hargittai  2005, 2009 , we  construct an Internet skill measure from 27 items asking about respondents’ level  of understanding of Internet- related terms. With the exclusion of missing values  on these measures, the valid responses to these five- point Likert- scale questions  are averaged to generate a global measure of Internet skill level.  Dependent Variables  To  measure  SNS  usage,  the  survey  asked  respondents  first  to  indicate  their  familiarity with various sites and then their experiences with using them. The  six  SNSs  included  on  the  questionnaire—based  on  their  popularity  at  the  time—were:  Bebo,  Facebook,  Friendster,  MySpace,  Orkut,  and  Xanga.  To  measure familiarity, we asked respondents to indicate whether they had ever  heard of the site. To measure experience, participants were asked to choose  one  of  the  following  options:  “No,  have  never  used  it,”  “Tried  it  once,  but  have  not  used  it  since,”  “Yes,  have  tried  it  in  the  past,  but  do  not  use  it  nowadays,”  “Yes,  currently  use  it  sometimes,”  and  “Yes,  currently  use  it  often.” We construct our measures of use from answers to this latter question.    A Typology of Social Network Site Use    153  Usage is measured by two dummy variables. The first considers whether the  respondent uses the site sometimes and the second accounts for using it often.  We then use these binary variables to construct measures of where users fall in  the  typology  of  SNS  usage  described  in  the  previous  section.  In  addition  to  constructing  this  five- category  variable  of  typology,  we  further  create  two  binary  dependent  variables  for  SNS  users.  First,  we  construct  a  variable  for  frequency  of  SNS  use  by  collapsing  Dabblers  and  Samplers   denoted  as  0   versus Devotees and Omnivores  denoted as 1 . Second, we construct a vari- able measuring the diversity of SNS use by collapsing Dabblers and Devotees   denoted as 0  versus Samplers and Omnivores  denoted as 1 .  Methods of Analysis  We  first  report  descriptive  statistics  about  variation  in  SNS  usage   i.e.,  the  aforementioned  typology ,  and  how  this  variation  may  differ  by  students’  demographic background. Next, given that our dependent variable, the typol- ogy  of  SNS  usage,  is  a  categorical  variable,  we  employ  multinomial  logistic  regression models in order to investigate further the differences in frequency  and diversity of SNS use, with controls for various factors. The multinomial  logistic regression is appropriate for our analyses, because it is developed for  modeling categorical dependent variables  Long, 1997 .4 We also employ two  separate  logistic  regression  models  to  analyze  whether  demographic  factors,  Internet user context and experiences, and online skills exhibit any systematic  relationship  with  either  frequency  or  diversity  of  SNS  usage  among  participants.  Sample Descriptives  The 1,060 first- year students included in these analyses represent a diverse group  of young adults. Table 7.1 shows descriptive statistics about the group. In total,  56% of the respondents are female, 44% are male. Almost all are 18 or 19 years  old, with a mean age of 18.4 and a median of 18. Fewer than half are White and  non- Hispanic.  Slightly  fewer  than  8%  claim  African  or  African  American  descent, almost 30% are of Asian or Asian American ancestry, and just under  one- fifth are of Hispanic origin. Students come from varied family backgrounds.  Over one- quarter of respondents have parents whose highest level of education  is no more than a high school degree, an additional 20% have parents without a  college degree  i.e., some college education . While it may seem that sampling  from a college population assumes a highly educated group, 25% of first- years at  this university leave the institution by their second year  Ardinger et al., 2004   and fewer than half  43.6%  will graduate from this school within six years of    154    Social Textures  enrollment  University of Illinois- Chicago, 2004 .5 Over half of the students at  this university commute from home and live with their parents  53.1% .   Baseline Internet access and use statistics  Table 7.2  for the sample suggest  that being online is not a novel concept in most of these students’ lives. On  average, participants have access to the Internet at over six locations and have  been users for over six years. When asked how often they go online, the vast  majority  report  doing  so  several  times  a  day.  They  estimate  spending  15.5  hours  visiting  websites  weekly   excluding  email,  chat,  and  voice  services .  While there is certainly variation in levels of access and use among particip- ants, there are no basic barriers standing in the way of these young adults to  accessing the Internet. Limits may be put  on their uses due to  other  factors   e.g.,  the  need  to  share  resources  at  home,  limited  hours  of  access  due  to  employment, commuting or parental controls , but they all have basic access.  This suggests that traditional concerns about the so- called digital divide do not  apply to these students regarding basic Internet availability. Thus, looking at  such a wired group of users allows us to hold basic access constant and focus  on differences in details of use instead.  Variation in Social Network Site Usage  As reported in earlier work based on this data set  Hargittai, 2007 , overall,  88% of respondents in this sample are SNS users. Only one student claimed   Table 7.1  Descriptive statistics about the sample  Women Age  18 19 20–29  Race and ethnicity  White, non-Hispanic Hispanic African American, non-Hispanic Asian Asian American, non-Hispanic Native American, non-Hispanic Highest level of parental education  Less than high school High school Some college College Graduate degree  Lives with parents  Percent  55.8  64.8 32.2   3.0  42.7 18.8   7.7 29.6   1.2    7.4 19.0 20.1 34.4 19.1 53.1   A Typology of Social Network Site Use    155  Table 7.2  Internet experiences of sample participants  Mean  Standard deviation  Number of Internet access locations Number of Internet use years Number of hours on the Web per week*    6.2   6.4 15.5     2.1     2.0   10.0   Note *This figure excludes time spent on email, chat, or online telephony  VoIP .  not to have heard of any of the six SNSs included on the survey  i.e., Bebo,  Facebook, Friendster, MySpace, Orkut, Xanga , so non- use is not a result of  not  being  familiar  with  these  services.  Rather,  despite  knowing  about  such  sites, over 12% of the sample does not use any of them. Table 7.3 presents  more  details  about  what  proportion  of  respondents  has  heard  about  and  has  used  or  currently  uses  the  six  SNSs  discussed  here.  Facebook  is  the  most  popular service among these students  78.8% , followed by MySpace  54.6% .  Almost two- thirds of the overall sample use Facebook frequently, but just over  one- third  use  MySpace  often.  The  other  four  sites  are  considerably  less  popular among respondents.   Table 7.4 presents the prevalence of each type of SNS use among particip- ants. As previously defined, “Dabbler” refers to those who only use one SNS  and do so only sometimes. Students who report using only one of the six sites  sometimes at the time of the study, we categorize as “Dabblers.” Just under  one- tenth of the sample  9.2%  fits this description. Students who currently  visit more than one of these sites, but none of them often, we categorize as   Table 7.3   Familiarity  and  experience  with  social  network  sites  among  participants    percentages   Uses it*  Has heard   of it  Has never  used it  Tried it once,  but no more  Used to use it,  no longer  Facebook MySpace  78.8  62.8  54.6  38.4   Xanga    6.2  1.9   Friendster    3.3  1.0   Orkut  Bebo    1.6  0.6     0.6  0.0   99.4 99.5  76.4  43.3    5.8    9.6  14.2 20.8  61.7  84.7  97.1  95.4    3.6   9.4  11.8    5.6    0.5    2.8    3.4 15.2  20.3    6.4    0.9    1.2  Note *Figures in parentheses refer to percent of students who visit the site often.   156    Social Textures  Table 7.4  Prevalence of social network site usage type among respondents*  Full sample  Among SNS users only  Non-users Dabblers Samplers Devotees Omnivores  12.31   9.19   4.45 28.79 45.27  10.48   5.08 32.83 51.62  Note *These figures are based on 1,056 respondents due to missing data for four respond- ents that make it impossible to classify their level of SNS engagement.  “Samplers.” This is the smallest category in the group with only 4.4% of stu- dents classified as such. Students who currently use only one of the six sites,  but do so often, are categorized as “Devotees.” They make up almost one- third  of the sample at 32.9%. Finally, we classify those who visit more than one of  these six sites with at least one of them visited often as “Omnivores.” This is  by  far  the  biggest  category,  with  almost  half  of  our  respondents   45.3%   exhibiting such behavior. These students are quite familiar with social network  sites and many of them use SNSs quite a bit.   Table 7.5 reports descriptive statistics by user background for SNS usage in  general,  and  for  the  various  categories  of  users  in  particular   Dabbler,  Sampler, Devotee, and Omnivore . While women are more likely to use SNSs  than  men,  once  we  break  down  usage  by  frequency  and  diversity  of  use,  women are only more likely to be Omnivores than are men, and there is no  gender difference regarding being a Dabbler, Sampler, or Devotee. There is  no  sharp  contrast  between  students  with  different  racial  and  ethnic  back- grounds. We only find that non- Hispanic African American students are signif- icantly  less  likely  to  be  Dabblers  and  non- Hispanic  Asian  American  students  are significantly more likely to be Devotees than their counterparts. Regarding  parental  education,  the  most  pronounced  finding  is  that  students  whose  parents have at least one parent with a college education are significantly less  likely to be Dabblers and more likely to be Omnivores. In addition, students  whose  parents  have  less  than  a  high  school  education  are  significantly  more  likely to be Dabblers and those whose parents have some college education are  significantly more likely to be Samplers than others.   As found in earlier work  Hargittai, 2007 , however, there is a relationship  between  SNS  usage  and  other  factors  such  as  context  of  use  and  experience  with the Internet, so it is best to further examine the differences in frequency  and diversity of SNS usage employing more advanced statistical techniques that  allow us to control for various factors simultaneously in our models.

Explaining Different Levels of Social Network  Site Engagement  In this section, using multinomial logistic regression analyses, we look at the  relationship  of  several  factors  and  intensity  of  SNS  usage.6  In  Table  7.6,  we  summarize  all  10  comparisons  between  different  types  of  SNS  users  in  our  model. For example, the second column  O–N , refers to the odds comparing  the  likelihood  of  being  an  Omnivore  versus  a  Non- User.  Likewise,  we  compare the odds of being an Omnivore to the odds of being a Dabbler in the  third column, and so on moving down the rest of the columns. The estimates  listed in Table 7.6 are the odds ratios generated from the multinomial logistic  regression models. Odds ratios larger than one favor the category on the left-  hand side, whereas the odds smaller than one favor the category on the right-  hand side. For example, looking at the row labeled “Female,” the number in  the  “O–N”  column  is  2.49.  This  means  that  women  are  considerably  more    158    Social Textures  likely  to  be  Omnivores  versus  Non- Users  than  are  men.  Likewise,  if  we  go  down a few rows, the figure for those living with parents in the same “O–N”  column is 0.530, suggesting that the respondents who currently live with their  parents are less likely to be Omnivores versus Non- Users than are those who  are  not  living  with  their  parents.  In  order  to  facilitate  interpretation  of  the  results,  we  derive  the  predicted  probabilities  from  the  models  and  explain  these probabilities regarding the relationship between our explanatory factors  and SNS user type. Figures that are statistically significant are highlighted in  bold typeface.  User Background Variables  Figure 7.2 summarizes the gender difference in the predicted probabilities of  SNS  user  type  while  holding  other  variables  at  their  mean.  In  particular,  female students are more likely to be Omnivores versus Non- Users, Dabblers,  or Devotees than are male students once we control for race ethnicity, paren- tal education, context of use, Internet experience, and skill. Females are also  more  likely  to  be  Devotees  or  Samplers  versus  Non- Users  than  are  males.  While earlier work  Hargittai, 2007  has already shown that female students  in this sample have a higher likelihood of using various SNSs, the current anal- ysis further indicates that they also have a higher likelihood of using such sites  more  intensely  than  their  male  peers.  In  other  words,  we  find  a  significant  gender difference in level of SNS user intensity.   As the next rows in Table 7.6 suggest, the odds of being different types of  SNS  users  do  not  differ  by  students’  race  and  ethnic  background  except  for  one case: Asians and Asian Americans are more likely to be Devotees or Sam- plers versus Omnivores than are White students. None of the comparisons are  statistically  significant  regarding  parental  education,  suggesting  that  socio- economic background does not relate to level of SNS engagement on the part  of the student when we take user context, as well as Internet experience and  skill, into consideration.  Context of Use  Variables measuring context of use were more likely to be significant predic- tors  of  SNS  user  type  than  users’  demographic  characteristics.  The  results  show  that  students  who  have  Internet  access  at  the  homes  of  those  in  their  social networks are more likely to be Omnivores and Devotees versus Non-  Users than those who do not have Internet access at such locations. Those who  have access at such places are also more likely to be Omnivores versus Dab- blers  than  are  those  who  do  not  have  such  access.

Respondents who live with  their parents are less likely to be Omnivores versus Non- Users, Dabblers, or  Samplers  than  those  who  do  not  live  with  their  parents   see  Figure  7.3 .  Respondents who live with their parents are less likely to be Devotees versus  Samplers.  These  comparisons  suggest  that  there  is  a  significant  relationship  between living condition and intensity of SNS usage, where students who live  with their parents have a lower likelihood of engaging with SNSs intensely.  Internet Experience  Perhaps  not  surprisingly,  we  observe  a  statistically  significant  relationship  between some Internet experience variables and SNS usage type. Understand- ably,  students  who  spend  more  time  online  weekly  are  more  likely  to  be  Omnivores  versus  Non- Users  and  Dabblers  than  those  who  spend  less  time  online. Additionally, students who spend more time online are more likely to  be  Devotees,  Samplers,  and  Non- Users  versus  Dabblers  than  are  those  who  spend  less  time  online.  The  figures  in  Table  7.7  illustrate  the  relationship  between  intensity  of  SNS  usage  and  hours  spent  online  weekly.  Taken  all  together, we find that, for the students who spend 30 hours or more on the  Web per week, the likelihood of being Non- Users and Dabblers is lower by  5.2 and 11.4 percentage points respectively than for those who only spend five    A Typology of Social Network Site Use    161  Living with parents Not living with parents     %      y t i l i  b a b o r p     d e  i  t c d e r P  60  50  40  30  20  10  0  Non-User  Dabbler  Sampler  Devotee  Omnivore  SNS user type  Figure 7.3  Probability of social network site user types by living context.  hours or less on the Web. At the same time, a frequent Web user’s likelihood  of  being  an  Omnivore  is  16.9  percentage  points  higher  than  an  infrequent  user’s likelihood. In contrast to the importance of time spent online regarding  SNS usage type, years of being an Internet user is not associated with variation  in SNS use intensity.   Regarding  online  skills,  students  who  exhibit  higher  levels  of  Internet  know- how  are  more  likely  to  be  Omnivores  versus  Non- Users  or  Devotees  than are  those who possess lower- level skills, once we  control for students’  demographic  and  socioeconomic  backgrounds,  context  of  use,  and  Internet  experiences.  In  order  to  demonstrate  the  magnitude  of  probability  change  associated  with  Internet  skills,  we  present  the  predicted  probability  for  the   Table 7.7   Probability  %  of being each type of social network site user for an infre-  quent  5 hours per week  versus frequent  30 hours per week  Web user  Time spent online per week 5 hours  30 hours  Non-Users Dabblers Samplers Devotees Omnivores  14.7 15.9   3.6 29.5 36.3    9.5   4.5   3.8 29.0 53.2   162    Social Textures  minimum and the maximum skill level in Table 7.8. As the figures reported in  Table 7.8 suggest, the predicted probability of being a Non- User for respond- ents who report minimal levels of Internet skill is 19.3% and these students  have a 33.6% chance of using SNSs intensely. However, for respondents with  the  maximum  level  of  Internet  skill,  the  predicted  probabilities  of  being  a  Non- User  and  an  Omnivore,  respectively,  are  6.5%  and  59.1%.  In  other  words, highly skilled users are much more likely to be in the Omnivore user  category than lower- skilled users.  Diversity and Frequency of Social Network Site Usage  Among SNS Users  In order to examine further whether the various explanatory variables exhibit  any  systematic  relationship  with  either  diversity  or  frequency  of  SNS  usage  among  SNS  users,  we  look  at  the  results  of  two  separate  logistic  regression  models  including  only  SNS  users.  As  the  figures  in  the  “Diversity  of  use”  column in Table 7.9 show, women as well as students who spend more time  online per week, and those who have higher Internet skills, are more likely to  be more diverse SNS users than their counterparts. In addition, compared to  White students, Asian and Asian American students have a lower likelihood of  being  diverse  SNS  users.  The  results  presented  in  the  “Frequency  of  use”  column suggest that no demographic factors influence how regularly respond- ents use SNSs. However, context of use and Internet experiences do seem to  make  a  difference.  Students  who  do  not  live  with  their  parents,  who  have  Internet access at a friend’s or family member’s home, and who spend more  time online per week are more likely to use SNSs often.   Tables  7.10  and  7.11  illustrate  the  predicted  probabilities  of  diverse  and  frequent SNS usage among SNS users in the sample, respectively. Here, we  only report figures for factors that exhibit a statistically significant relationship  with the outcome variables as per the results in Table 7.9.

At the same time, the variables  concerning  context  of  use  only  affect  the  frequency  of  SNS  usage,  whereas  gender, being Asian or Asian American, and level of Internet skill are related  to diversity of SNS usage, but not frequency of use.   164    Social Textures  Table 7.10  Probability  %  of diverse social network site usage  Diverse SNS usage  Gender  Race ethnicity  Male 50.9  Asians 51.1  Time spent  online per week  5 hours 47.4  Conclusion  Female 61.5  Whites 59.4  30 hours 63.9  Internet skills  1 standard deviation below mean 1 standard deviation above mean 51.4  62.2  Drawing on a unique data set with unprecedented granularity about the use of  social network sites coupled with detailed demographic background informa- tion, this study has looked at what types of user characteristics  from among a  diverse  group  of  first- year  students  at  an  urban  public  university   are  most  likely  to  be  associated  with  different  levels  of  SNS  use  intensity.  Findings  suggest that level of engagement is not randomly distributed among the group.  Gender is an important factor when it comes to explaining intensity of SNS  usage, with women more likely to be intense users of SNSs than men. We also  find that context of Internet use may explain one’s level of engagement with  SNSs;  namely,  students  who  do  not  live  with  their  parents  and  have  more  access points in their personal networks have a higher likelihood of using SNSs  intensely. Additionally, we find that there is a systematic relationship between  hours  spent  online  weekly  as  well  as  Web  user  skills  and  intensity  of  SNS  usage, suggesting that students who have more Internet experiences and higher  online abilities are more likely to be more engaged with SNSs. We are unable  to  speak  to  the  direction  of  causality  here  based  on  the  data  set  we  have.  It  may well be that more skilled users are more likely to integrate SNSs into their  daily routines. However, it may also be that those who spend more time on  such  sites  develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  Internet.  There  is  a  good  chance that both of these processes are at work, reinforcing each other long  term.   While our nuanced data set has allowed us to explore some questions that  previous literature has been unable to consider, there are other issues our data  are not suited to examine. In particular, the information available here does  not allow us to distinguish between the importance of different site designs,  affordances and memberships for why some people are more or less likely to  become intense users of one SNS over another. However, it is reasonable to    A Typology of Social Network Site Use    165  Table 7.11  Probability  %  of frequent social network site usage  Living with parents  Have Net access at friends’ family’s home  Time spent online per week  Frequent SNS usage   No 90.2 No 79.1 5 hours 77.5  Yes 81.3 Yes 86.8 30 hours 90.7  expect that such divergences across these services result in different levels of  engagement  on  behalf  of  users.  In  particular,  if  the  designs  and  affordances  support  certain  types  of  outcomes  at  varying  levels   e.g.,  civic  organizing  is  easier  on  one  as  compared  to  another ,  then  people  will  likely  embrace  the  sites that are most supportive of their particular interests. A user who is espe- cially focused on political engagement may expend more energies on building  networks  on  a  site  that  encourages  related  activities,  while  a  user  more  intrigued by following the latest artistic trends will spend time on the site that  caters to that particular interest best. Future work in this area can apply our  proposed  SNS  usage  typology  to  investigate  what  factors  may  lead  users  to  engage with different sites at varying levels of intensity.   In  addition  to  its  substantive  contributions,  this  study  also  has  important  methodological  implications.  When  examining  SNS  usage,  researchers  must  be careful to take the extent to which users are engaged with the sites under  consideration. Rather than assume that all SNS usage is interchangeable, it is  important to recognize that some people have incorporated use of such sites  into their everyday lives much more than others. Accordingly, when consider- ing the various social, cultural, political, and psychological implications of time  spent on such sites, it is important to establish where people fall in the typol- ogy  of  social  network  site  usage,  recognizing  that  varying  levels  of  usage  intensity are not necessarily synonymous.

The Principle Investigator of this project is not now nor has ever been affiliated  with this university in any way other than in the context of this study. Focus on  this campus is not due to convenience; rather, it is the result of careful considera- tion about what type of student population would be most helpful in addressing  questions of interest in the overall research project.  3.  The survey included a question verifying students’ attentiveness to the question- naire. A small portion of students  3.4%  were identified as not paying attention  to question wording, suggesting that they were checking off responses randomly  instead of replying to the substance of the questions. The responses of these stu- dents have been excluded from the data and analyses presented here so as to mini- mize error introduced through such respondents.  4.  Multinomial logistic regression estimates the likelihood of being in a certain cat- egory versus the likelihood of being in another category  i.e., baseline category ,  while  holding  all  the  explanatory  variables  constant.  Researchers  can  switch  the  baseline category and repeat the comparison process in order to acquire the esti- mates of every possible pair of comparisons. Based on the estimated coefficients,  we can then generate the predicted probabilities of being a member of each cat- egory and interpret the results.  5.  Some of those who leave UIC will transfer to other schools and end up graduating  elsewhere. Data are not available to establish what percentage of UIC first- years  end up leaving college altogether.  6.  Students of Native American background have been excluded from these analyses,  due  to  their  small  number.  We  also  excluded  respondents  from  our  regression  models if they were missing values on any of the variables used in the analyses.

Chapter 8 Exploring the Use of Social  Network Sites in the Workplace  Mary Beth Watson- Manheim  Introduction  There is considerable interest in the use of social media in organizations today. In  this chapter I explore the potential for use of social network sites  SNSs  for per- forming organizational work activities. I focus on the use of SNSs in the workplace  for communication and collaboration between employees  either in the same or  different organizations , which is directed toward the range of firm activities sup- porting the production and distribution of products and services. In other words,  this chapter is not focused on customer interactions primarily directed toward the  marketing of products and services or the management of the firm’s brand.   The question I explore is what value a new set of communication media tools  can bring to organizations where employees already have a plethora of media to  choose from to perform work activities, and under what conditions is it likely that  these tools will be adopted. In particular, I discuss the use of SNSs to perform col- laborative work activities. There are a wide variety of different types of SNS avail- able to users which have had varying degrees of success  boyd & Ellison, 2008 .  However, I do not focus on a particular site, i.e., LinkedIn or MySpace, but in  software applications that enable similar functionalities. In this chapter, I base my  discussion of SNSs on the general definition offered by boyd and Ellison  2008 :  web- based  services  that  allow  individuals  to   1   construct  a  public  or  semi- public profile within a bounded system,  2  articulate a list of other  users with whom they share a connection, and  3  view and traverse their  list of connections and those made by others within the system.   p. 211   In line with Grudin  2006 , I argue that a significant benefit of social media in  organizations will likely be for knowledge management, which includes “acquir- ing or creating knowledge, transforming it into a reusable form, retaining it, and  finding  and  reusing  it”   Grudin,  2006,  p.  1 .  A  number  of  different  types  of    170    Social Textures  software  products  have  been  developed  to  support  organizational  knowledge  management,  e.g.,  document  management  systems,  other  information  reposi- tories, expertise location systems. However, these products have generally not  been as successful as expected; they are often cumbersome to use while provid- ing  limited  benefit,  and  are  expensive  to  implement  and  maintain   Grudin,  2006 . Social media, on the other hand, require much fewer resources to imple- ment, e.g., equipment, maintenance, and user training. Moreover, they are self-  organizing and make information and networks of activity highly visible.   The  adoption  of  a  new  communication  medium  in  organizations  is  compli- cated. Organizations have become more and more geographically distributed with  increasing dependence on electronic media for communication and collaboration.  Employees  have  a  wide  variety  of  communication  media  to  use  in  performing  work activities, from email to instant messaging to pagers to groupware applica- tions to the telephone, in addition to new social media such as wikis and blogs.  The variety of devices and applications in use has increased the complexity of the  communication environment. Multiple communication media are used both sepa- rately and in combination with usage patterns varying across different teams and  different work processes  Watson- Manheim & Belanger, 2007 . The introduction  of any new communication medium into an organization disrupts existing com- munication practices. New usage structures and routines must be developed for  the new medium and integrated into the overall communication patterns of the  user community  Rennecker & Godwin, 2003; Orlikowski, 2000 .   Hence,  while  the  use  of  social  media  may  offer  a  number  of  benefits  for  organizations, when and under what conditions adoption will take place is not  clear. In this chapter, I explore this question. I first present a brief example   based on a summary of several conversations with senior IT executives  of a  company that expects to receive benefits from the organizational use of a spe- cific social media tool, SNSs, but sees considerable barriers in the actual adop- tion of the medium. I then explore more generally the unique capabilities of  SNSs and the benefits use of this medium may offer to today’s organization. I  introduce  the  notion  of  communication  media  repertoire  to  investigate  the  introduction of a new medium into the existing array of communication media  used in an organization  Watson- Manheim & Belanger, 2007 .  SNSs at GenCo  GenCo  is  a  large  multinational  corporation  with  approximately  75,000  employees and offices in more than 100 countries. GenCo is very decentralized  with autonomous business units focused on specialty products and services for  the  healthcare  industry.  Because  of  the  focus  on  different  products  with  different customer needs and different levels and types of product complexity,    Social Network Sites in the Workplace    171  the units operate differently. Yet, there are potential synergies across product  lines.  Co- marketing  and  co- development  of  product  lines  and  services  is  a  potential  growth  area.  For  example,  drugs  and  services  developed  and  mar- keted for different diseases may be co- branded to provide a broader range of  services for a healthcare patient with multiple needs.   The challenge faced by management is how to foster connections between  individuals across autonomous business units of a highly distributed company  in a complex and rapidly changing industry. A common management practice  to  address  this  problem  is  to  create  customer- facing  cross- functional  teams  across different areas of the firm and providing groupware, e.g., WebEx™,  or  other  electronic  communication  platforms  to  support  collaboration  between these individuals. However, management at GenCo believes that it is  difficult  to  predetermine  the  members  of  these  teams.  The  rapidly  changing  environment,  both  in  discovery  of  new  treatments  and  in  the  regulation  of  treatments,  means  that  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  the  next  innovation  or  the  individuals  with  the  knowledge  to  develop  the  innovation.  Instead,  the  firm  wants to focus on creating social connections to support the emergence of col- laborative relationships that will lead to innovation.   GenCo IT managers report that they have been unable to find one tool that  supports the development of social connections between disparate individuals.  The emergence of effective teams that can work together to produce a product  or service innovation requires not only that members have the necessary exper- tise but also that they can work cohesively together. As one manager said, “There  is a difference between finding an expert and finding a ‘trusted’ expert.” Thus,  the challenge is two- fold. There is the challenge of finding and connecting people  with the needed expertise, but also providing a social context for trusting rela- tionships to emerge. Managers feel that SNSs add important context to informa- tion such as: how is this person related to me? Who do they know that I know?  Is their background similar to mine? This social context is especially critical to  the working relationships of distant employees.   Finally,  management  expects  that  SNSs  can  offer  intangible  benefits  that  would  be  valuable  to  GenCo.  First,  in  an  increasingly  discontinuous  work  environment, SNSs offer a platform for creating a social community within the  workplace.  Second,  management  feels  that  young  people,  who  have  deeply  integrated SNS use into their personal life, will be more likely to work at firms  that support this communication platform.   This GenCo example does not represent one particular firm but an aggrega- tion of comments made by IT managers at a number of firms with employees,  and hence knowledge, distributed across many geographic locations. GenCo,  like many firms, is competing in an industry marked by rapid change, global  competition, and the need for continuous innovation. I next discuss in more    172    Social Textures  detail the changes that are taking place in the workplace and the possible lim- itations of current communication media used in these firms.  Connecting in a Discontinuous Work  Environment  The ability of an organization to assess and respond rapidly to the competitive  environment is a necessity in a hypercompetitive environment. Communica- tion with colleagues is critical to performing work activities in this environ- ment.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the  complex  and  knowledge- intensive  environment  of  a  company  such  as  GenCo.  The  expertise  of  employees  is  a  critical capability of the firm. Leveraging that expertise to bring new innovat- ive products and services to market faster than the competition is a core com- petitive advantage of the firm.   Performing  work  activities  often  involves  the  application  of  individuals’  knowledge  or  expertise  to  generate  new  knowledge   O’Leary,  Wooley,  &  Mortensen,  2008 .  New  knowledge  is  created  as  individuals  exchange  and  combine knowledge through communication events  Nonaka, 1994 . Although  ranging in degree, knowledge work tasks are inherently ill- structured  Quinn,  2005 . As seen at GenCo, it is not always predictable what particular expertise  is needed in a project. For example, an employee with expertise in nutrition  may see an opportunity in the market for co- marketing cholesterol- lowering  drugs with nutrition advice. After putting together a team with expertise in  both areas and surveying the market, the group may decide that they also need  someone with understanding of diabetic needs. In other words, the combina- tion  of  expertise  needed  to  develop  an  innovative  product  or  service  may  evolve over the life of the project.   A  critical  component  of  knowledge  work,  then,  is  to  be  able  to  identify  individuals with needed expertise in a timely manner and communicate with  them at a productive level. For example, the GenCo team may simply need  information about the possibility of swelling or weight gain in diabetic patients  with  abnormal  cholesterol.  Communication  in  this  instance  may  involve  finding relevant resources and gathering information. On the other hand, the  team  may  actually  need  an  expert  to  contribute  as  a  member  of  the  team  which could require a different set of skills and a different working relation- ship. To effectively perform work activities, knowledge workers invest signi- ficant  time  and  effort  to  develop  and  maintain  personal  social  networks  of  contacts to fit the specific needs of a situation. “These networks are a signific- ant organizing principal for work and information”  Nardi et al., 2002, p. 89 .   Although  hierarchical  organizations  still  provide  important  efficiencies  in  the  global  economy,  organizations  are  flatter  and  more  decentralized,  often    Social Network Sites in the Workplace    173  spread  across  a  number  of  geographic  locations.  Organizational  borders  are  more and more porous; integration across the supply chain, alliances with both  customers  and  competitors,  and  other  types  of  partnerships  mean  that  an  employee’s network of contacts often includes members from the same and  different  organizations  who  work  at  various  locations  which  can  be  spread  across one or many different countries.   While necessary, it is complicated and expensive for employees to use their  networks of personal relationships to get the resources they need to perform  work activities  Nardi et al., 2002 . Maintaining a personal network requires  significant effort when compared to hierarchical or formal organizational rela- tionships, which are pre- determined and role- based. For example, employees  must  remember  identities  of  and  details  about  individuals  who  are  not  con- tacted frequently, connections between people, and what information or doc- uments  have  previously  been  exchanged.  Whereas  in  formal  organizational  relationships,  such  specific  information  is  not  required:  knowing  the  formal  role of the person would provide sufficient information to acquire the needed  resources  Nardi et al., 2002 .   Thus, while the use of electronic communication makes it easier to engage  in  communication  with  colleagues  regardless  of  location,  the  complexity  of  work  relationships  and  communication  practices  is  increasing.  The  speed  at  which  connections  between  people  are  configured  and  reconfigured  has  increased  dramatically,  as  has  the  number  of  connections  an  employee  may  have.  Workers  increasingly  communicate  electronically  to  work  with  col- leagues at distant locations, often without actually meeting colleagues face- to- face. Work activities must be dynamically allocated across people or subgroups  depending  on  environmental  demands,  resulting  in  increased  switching  of  tasks, roles, and work assignments.   A  key  characteristic  of  these  situations  is  that  connected  individuals  are  working  across  boundaries  which  create  discontinuities,  i.e.,  gaps  or  lack  of  coherence  in  aspects  of  work   Watson- Manheim,  Chudoba,  &  Crowston,  2002 .  Boundaries  can  include  the  temporal  work  location   e.g.,  working  asynchronously  across  time  zones ,  geographic  work  location,  work  group  membership   e.g.,  who  you  work  with ,  and  cultural  backgrounds,  either  national  or  professional.  Workers  may  collaborate  across  organizational  boundaries, e.g., teams in supply chain, or boundaries in national or profes- sional background, e.g., cross- functional teams, global software development  teams  Espinosa, Cummings, Wilson, & Pearce, 2003 .   Working  across  boundaries  can  highlight  a  lack  of  shared  context  that  can  lead to difficulties performing collaborative work activities. Individuals can have  differing priorities, norms of behavior, communication practices, and understand- ing of problems that can create a lack of coherent work practices. For example, a    174    Social Textures  team with members primarily in the US which adds a member from a work unit  in China may suddenly face discontinuities in time zone and language. Established  communication norms and work practices will need to be adjusted if the team is  to collaborate effectively. Similarly, a manager of a team in an inter- organizational  global alliance described the following difficulties that members faced:  Dissimilar market conditions and customer acceptance expectations led to  different  understanding  of  the  product,  and  complicated  the  selling  process. In Europe, standards are a big issue. Everything has to meet the  particular government’s environmental, electrical, etc. standards and this  makes selling the product more complicated than in the US.   Personal conversation with management   Thus, differences in the political and regulatory environments in the respective  countries can also create significant challenges to distributed workers.   An  increasingly  common  feature  of  today’s  work  environment  is  multi-  teaming, where an employee is a member of multiple teams at any one time   Chudoba, Wynn, Lu, & Watson- Manheim, 2005; O’Leary et al., 2009 . This  can amplify the effect of discontinuities as individuals may not only face a dis- continuous team environment but also discontinuities across teams. Chudoba et  al.  2005  found that employees at Intel were members of an average of five  teams person, with a number of employees reporting membership on as many  as 12 teams. Team membership can change rapidly  O’Leary et al., 2009  to  respond to shifting requirements or environmental changes; members move in  and out depending on current priorities. New members can be added as skills  are needed without consideration of geographic location. These members may  be  core,  i.e.,  active  participants  who  are  integral  to  the  overall  work  of  the  team, or they may be peripheral, i.e., less- active participants who only attend  meetings  when  their  particular  area  is  being  addressed  or  when  their  skill  is  needed  Crowston & Howison, 2005 .   Paradoxically, the dramatic increase in information and resources available  to knowledge workers and the ease with which connections can be formed has  increased the complexity of the work environment. Electronic communication  media is becoming deeply integrated into knowledge work activities, while the  work environment employees face is often disconnected.  More Ways to Connect but Less Connectedness  At  GenCo,  management  does  not  believe  current  electronic  communication  platforms provide the support for connecting individuals in an increasingly frag- mented  and  discontinuous  environment.  On  the  surface,  this  seems  to  be  a    Social Network Sites in the Workplace    175  surprising  assessment  as  there  are  an  increasing  number  of  communication  media available in the workplace for individuals to use in performing collabora- tive activities and sharing information. Email is ubiquitous, available on an indi- vidual’s desktop, laptop, or mobile device. Employees can also use instant mes- saging and text messaging via these devices. Employees report that synchronous  voice conversations via telephone at the desk, over landline or VOIP, or the  mobile phone, are still some of the most commonly used media. In general, this  set of communication media allows directed communication between a sender  and an unlimited, but pre- determined, number of recipients. The conversation  is generally available only to those who are participating.   Other  applications  such  as  electronic  bulletin  boards,  discussion  forums,  and  online  communities  allow  individuals  to  share,  request,  or  discuss  information in a more public manner. Conversations are open to all members  of  the  community.  Any  message  can  be  read   and  responded  to   by  anyone  else  who  is  a  member.  Members  of  the  community  may  be  predefined  by  organizational role or they may emerge based on interest. These conversations  can be organized and archived in document databases although this archiving  does not always happen.   The  increasing  digitization  of  information  and  the  increase  in  electronic  communication  has  led  to  an  explosion  of  explicit  organizational  knowledge  available to be transmitted and reused or combined to create new knowledge.  Despite  the  ease  of  communicating  electronically,  actually  finding  relevant  information  in  a  timely  manner  is  a  continuing  problem  in  the  workplace   Grudin, 2006 . Grudin cites the following example of a typical problem: “a  pharmaceutical company found that although clinical tests of a compound are  expensive,  searching  for  possible  past  test  results  of  a  compound  would  be  more expensive than retesting some of them”  2006, p. 1 .   Despite  the  proliferation  of  document  management  systems  to  catalog  structured documents, organized discussions archived in document databases,  and  other  electronic  storage  and  retrieval  devices,  applicable  knowledge  remains difficult to find. Moreover, the social context surrounding the know- ledge  is  often  not  available,  e.g.,  who  created  it  under  what  circumstances.  Stripped of its context, the knowledge becomes even more difficult to reuse.   As compared to other electronic media, SNSs offer a number of advantages  for organizations. SNSs facilitate the emergent formation of new relationships  and  support  the  maintenance  of  existing  relationships   Ellison,  Lampe,  Steinfield,  &  Vitak,  2010 .  Importantly,  SNSs  enable  users  to  articulate  and  make  visible  their  social  networks   boyd  &  Ellison,  2008 .  After  joining  an  SNS, users are prompted to identify others in the system with whom they have  a relationship. The unique nature of SNSs allows users to more quickly estab- lish  contextual  information  about  contacts—for  example,  situating  new    176    Social Textures  acquaintances within their existing network of contacts, e.g., are any of their  friends also my friends or belong to the same group that I belong to?   While SNSs are organized around individuals, their value comes from the  social  capital  created  within  the  community.  The  information  on  the  SNS  is  user generated and propagated through the users’ network of contacts. More  personally relevant information is spread faster and more easily. Users of SNSs  acquire, evaluate, and disseminate information, e.g., comparing movie prefer- ences,  with  their  network  of  contacts.  In  addition,  they  are  developing  methods of leading and influencing others toward collective goals, e.g., use of  SNSs for political activity was especially prominent in the recent US Presiden- tial election  Kaye, 2010 . These actions and the understanding of using the  capabilities  of  media  to  carry  them  out  are  similar  to  the  skills  required  of  knowledge workers in distributed organizations.   Despite the potential of significant benefit for GenCo, management is skep- tical of the actual adoption of this medium by employees. The benefits of SNSs  to an individual user, such as a feeling of community or the ability to connect  with  colleagues  with  common  interests,  are  difficult  to  realize  until  the  medium  has  an  adequate  critical  mass  of  users.  Like  any  communication  medium,  the  benefits  increase  dramatically  as  the  number  of  users  increase.  However, it is unclear what benefit users will find in the medium until a large  number of people are using the site.   I suggest that this difficulty is compounded by the fact that the adoption of  any new communication medium requires a change in an individual’s commu- nication practices. If this change is to be sustained, the practices of the indi- vidual’s  communication  partners  must  also  change  and  new  norms  of  communication  develop.  I  propose  that  the  adoption  of  SNSs  will  be  more  likely to be pushed into the organization as they become more widely estab- lished in external social practices instead of being pulled into the organization  as  previous  knowledge  management  applications  or  most  other  communica- tion media. I next use the concept of a communication media repertoire as a  lens to view the adoption of SNSs in organizations.  Communication Media Repertoire  Watson- Manheim and Belanger  2007  put forth the notion of a communica- tion media repertoire to investigate the use of multiple communication media  in  organizations.  They  define  a  communication  media  repertoire  as  “the  collection of communication channels and identifiable routines of use for spe- cific  communication  purposes  within  a  defined  community”   p.  268 .  The  general framework they propose is shown in Figure 8.1. I have modified the    Social Network Sites in the Workplace    177  framework by elaborating their original description of institutional conditions  to include both organizational and social components.   The framework links institutional conditions and norms of communication  usage with individual perceptions of different media and with usage patterns.  It  emphasizes  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  communication  media  repertoires.  Individuals  within  a  work  community  use  different  media  for  different  pur- poses.  Through  usage,  they  develop  rules  or  norms  for  communicating,  thereby forming communication media repertoires. A community’s communi- cation media repertoire is reflexively constructed through media usage in the  performance  of  work  activities.  Thus,  use  of  a  medium   or  combination  of  media  plays a central role in understanding the repertoires in the community.  In a specific situation, media usage is influenced by:  the existing repertoire of practices, structuring conditions, and  1.  2.  3.  perceived consequences of use.    Structuring conditions include both institutional and situational conditions.  Institutional conditions shape the set of possibilities of media usage that a user  perceives  as  appropriate.  Institutional  conditions  can  include  physical  struc- ture,  organizational  culture,  and  incentive  structures   Watson- Manheim  &  Belanger,  2007 .  For  example,  employees  in  the  two  organizations  they  studied  worked  in  different  physical  structures.  In  one  organization  the  employees were in a “hoteling” environment, where there were no permanent  offices. Employees came to work in an office at intermittent times during the  week, spending the rest of the time in a client office or at home. In the second  organization, employees had collocated permanent offices at a large customer  location.  Not  surprisingly,  employees  in  the  two  different  organizations  had  different preferences for the use of face- to-face meetings for various commu- nication processes, e.g., knowledge sharing, coordination, etc.   More importantly, the employees reported very different perceptions of the  capabilities of the media to support the same communication processes. At the  first  organization,  employees  did  not  simply  report  that  FTF  meetings  were  convenient so they did not use electronic media for meetings, they stressed the  value  of  capabilities  of  FTF  meetings   e.g.,  the  ability  to  look  someone  in  the eye  as a reason for using this medium. On the other hand, individuals in  the “hoteling” organization stressed capabilities of electronic media that made it  most suitable for accomplishing the same communication process.   Through  routine  use  of  media  and  the  perceived  consequence  of  usage,  employees  in  the  work  unit  developed  perceptions  of  the  capabilities  of  the  media  and  appropriateness  of  use   Watson- Manheim  &  Belanger,  2007;    178    Social Textures  Yates & Orlikowski, 1992 . For example, trying to hold FTF meetings at the  “hoteling”  organization  required  employees  to  restructure  their  entire  day  while  electronic  media  did  not.  In  this  framework,  institutional  conditions  shape the set of possibilities, while situational conditions can have more influ- ence over which practice is invoked at a particular point in time. These varia- tions  are  based  on  individuals’  interpretations  of  the  situation  and  their  perception of the capabilities that the media afford in a given situation. It is  through  situational  variances  that  new  media  practices  are  developed  and  adopted in the user community as suggested in the following example.  An  example  from  our  research  illustrates  the  improvisational  nature  of  media usage practices. At IntOrg, the pager was described as the primary  medium for urgent communications. In practice, understanding of what  exactly was meant by “urgent” and when to actually use the pager varied  significantly. While most employees agree that the pager was to be used  when there was an immediate need to respond to a customer request or  concern,  the  pager  was  also  seen  as  a  way  to  insure  a  timely  response  under a variety of circumstances. Consequently, some employees report  that the pager was overused making it difficult to get a timely response  and often causing them to use an alternative medium in combination with  the pager. These isolated examples did not emerge as an alternate norm  of  media  usage  in  urgent  situations;  however,  this  case  provides  an  example  of  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  repertoires  and  how  actual  usage  practices and observations of consequences can ultimately lead to changes  in norms of usage.   Watson- Manheim & Belanger, 2007, p. 285   Communication  media  repertoires  are  constituted  and  reconstituted  through  media usage in the performance of ongoing, routine work activities. Situational  variations can lead to the emergence of new norms. It is clear that the introduc- tion of a new communication medium will also disrupt existing work practices  and  communication  norms.  For  this  reason,  even  when  the  use  of  a  new  medium can bring benefit to those who use it, there is often resistance to chang- ing established patterns of behavior. For individuals to change existing commu- nication  practices  requires  them  to  envision  some  benefit  that  will  offset  the  effort required to learn to use a new medium. In addition, the repertoire of the  communication must be adapted to encompass the new medium.   Many  software  applications  have  been  developed  and  implemented  in  organizations to help users find and reuse knowledge, and make connections  with  individuals  who  have  expertise  in  a  particular  domain.  However,  these  applications have met with little success due to limited use by organizational    Social Network Sites in the Workplace    179  members. In many cases, knowledge workers have not found that these appli- cations  actually  provide  sufficient  advantage  in  their  search  for  resources,  either  information  or  people,  to  integrate  them  into  their  media  repertoire   Grudin, 2006 .  Influence of External Communication Practices  A communication media repertoire is defined to exist with a particular user  community. As use of the Internet has become more wide- spread and more  integrated into the communication practices of individuals across the multiple  spheres  of  their  lives,  organizational  users  belong  to  different  communities  with different understandings and expectations of communication media use.  It is reasonable to expect that social practices external to the organization can  influence the development of a repertoire in an organization  Markus, 1994;  Yates & Orlikowski, 1992 .   SNSs represent an electronic communication medium where social norms are  rapidly being developed outside of the organization. For example, a large number  of entry- level employees, who entered college after 2004 when Facebook began  to spread across college campuses, have integrated the medium into their methods  of meeting new people and building relationships. In general, boyd and Ellison   2008   argue  that  through  regular  use  SNSs  become  “deeply  embedded  in  people’s lives.” Users can “gather” with their friends even when they are not geo- graphically  collocated,  thereby  potentially  strengthening  relationships  that  may  have weakened due to inactivity. Contrary to some popular perceptions, SNSs are  not primarily used by people to meet strangers but to deepen and extend offline  connections   Ellison  et  al.,  2010 .  Thus,  people  who  use  SNSs  routinely  will  develop  communication  norms  that  include  SNS  usage  practices.  These  indi- viduals will bring an understanding of capabilities of SNSs into the organization.  Increasingly they will expect to use similar strategies and technologies to develop  relationships and gather information for job performance.   To  capture  this  phenomenon,  I  extend  the  communication  media  reper- toire  framework  by  elaborating  the  notion  of  institution  as  put  forth  by  Watson- Manheim  and  Belanger   2007 .  They  categorize  physical  structure,  the  social  structure,  and  incentive  structure   for  use  of  different  media   as  institutional factors. These three structural dimensions are located within the  organizations they were studying. The authors did not consider the influence  of technology usage practices developed outside of the organization. In Figure  8.1, I suggest that institutional structuring conditions and norms of usage are  composed  of  an  organizational  aspect  and  a  social  aspect.  The  social  aspect  includes the normative use of media by an employee referent group outside of  the organization.   180    Social Textures  Structuring conditions Institutional Organizational    Physical structure of   workplace    Organizational culture    Incentive structure social Social    Normative use of media   by employee referent group Situational  Communication  media  repertoire  Use of  communication  media for purpose  Media usage  Variation in usage  Perceived  consequences  of use  Repetition of usage pattern  Norms of usage Institutional    Organizational    Social Situational  Figure 8.1   Framework  for  investigating  communication  media  repertoire   source:   adapted from Watson-Manheim & Belanger, 2007 .    The  intangible  benefit  of  community  building  may  become  a  significant  motivating factor for many users if the use of SNSs becomes more accepted  across  society.  SNSs  will  likely  become  places  to  connect  with  others  with  similar  interests  or  backgrounds.  This  may  be  a  powerful  motivator  in  an  increasingly  dispersed  organization  where  people  are  commonly  separated  from their work group, e.g., they are members of a geographically distributed  team. Physical separation from co- workers, or isolation in the case of telecom- muters, can cause feelings of isolation and loss of identity, which can be detri- mental to organizational cohesion.   I contend that the adoption of SNSs may be primarily a grass- roots effort,  pushed  into  the  organization  by  external  social  norms  initially,  rather  than  largely  pulled  through  a  formal  implementation.  This  does  not  mean,  however, that management in the organizations will not exercise control over  the process. It is not clear how the process will evolve, but management still    Social Network Sites in the Workplace    181  must align use of the medium and the work activities people engage in with  the overall goals of the organization. New types of incentives may be needed,  not  individual,  group,  or  organization,  but  some  motivation  to  stimulate  development  of  self- organized  networks,  e.g.,  encourage  people  to  collabo- rate  to  solve  complex  problems  where  the  expertise  needed  is  not  immedi- ately clear.   In addition, management must address issues of security and privacy. There  are  likely  long- term  implications  stemming  from  the  adoption  of  SNSs  for  organizational use. Since SNSs by design enable users to construct an identity  within a community, there will be implications for security of information in  an  organization.  For  example,  self- organized  teams  of  employees  will  need  some way to insure that co- workers they have never met are in fact who they  say they are; that their profile and connections are an accurate representation.

Part III  Convergent Practices Intuitive Appropriations of  Social Network Site  Affordances    Chapter 9 United We Stand? Online Social Network Sites and  Civic Engagement  Thomas J. Johnson, Weiwu Zhang,   Shannon L. Bichard, and Trent Seltzer  The  2008  election  marked  a  seismic  shift  in  how  candidates,  particularly  Barack Obama, campaigned for the presidency. Pundits have touted 2008  as the Facebook Election where the top- down style of political campaigning  was replaced by the grass- roots dynamics of online social networks, particu- larly Facebook and YouTube. Obama used his huge advantage in number of  Facebook  members  over  challengers  Hillary  Clinton  and  John  McCain  to  mobilize  an  army  of  volunteers  and  to  amass  a  huge  campaign  war  chest  through  his  legion  of  small,  individual  donators   Fraser  &  Dutta,  2008;  Stelter,  2008 .  YouTube  provided  a  way  for  both  candidates  to  get  their  message directly to the voter and for citizens to create videos and become  part of the campaign conversation  Grove, 2008 .   Most  of  the  work  on  social  network  sites   SNSs   has  focused  on  user  characteristics and user motives for accessing these sites  e.g., boyd, 2004;  Kaye, 2010; Papacharissi & Mendelson, 2008; Postelnicu & Cozma, 2007,  2008; Royal, 2008; Sweetser & Weaver- Lariscy, 2007 . Less attention has  been paid to the effects of social network sites on users’ political attitudes  and behaviors. The few studies that have examined the connection between  social  network  sites  and  political  attitudes  suggest  that,  in  general,  these  sites may not have much influence on political attitudes and behavior  Pol- stelnicu  &  Cozma,  2008;  Zhang,  Johnson,  Seltzer,  &  Bichard,  in  press ,  although  political  users  of  SNSs  may  do  a  much  better  job  of  predicting  political attitudes and behaviors  Kim & Geidner, 2008; Utz, 2009; Valen- zuela,  Park,  &  Kee,  2009;  Vitak,  Zube,  Smock,  Carr,  Ellison,  &  Lampe,  2009 .   This study uses a national online panel of 533 Internet users to explore  the  degree  to  which  relying  on  social  network  sites  and  YouTube  will  predict  offline  political  participation,  online  political  participation,  intent  to vote, and reliance on face- to-face discussion for political information.   186    Convergent Practices  Social Network Sites and Political Engagement  Most of the studies examining the effects of social networks on political atti- tudes and behavior have centered on social capital  Ellison, Lampe, Steinfield,  &  Vitak,  2010;  Ellison,  Steinfield,  &  Lampe,  2007;  Leiner,  Hohlfeld,  &  Quiring, 2009; Royal, 2008; Steinfield, Ellison, & Lampe, 2008; Valenzuela,  Park,  &  Kee,  2009   because  studies  suggest  that  people  primarily  use  social  network sites to remain in contact with existing friends and learn more about  individuals they meet offline  boyd & Ellison, 2007; Lampe, Ellison, & Stein- field, 2006 . Less attention has been paid to whether social network sites influ- ence political attitudes and behavior, and that evidence has been mixed.   Studies  suggest  that  social  network  site  users  score  high  on  political  atti- tudes and behaviors such as political interest, campaign interest, and political  efficacy  Kaye, 2010; Kim & Geidner, 2008; Postelnicu & Cozma, 2008; Vitak  et al., 2009 , but social network use in general does not seem strongly related  to political attitudes and behaviors. Postelnicu and Cozma  2008  found that  motivations  for  using  social  network  sites  had  little  influence  on  campaign  involvement, interest, and efficacy. Similarly, Zhang and associates  in press   found social network use linked to civic participation, but not political partici- pation  or  confidence  in  government.  Zhang  and  associates  suggested  that  because social network sites are designed to connect individuals, it is not sur- prising that it is more connected to civic participation such as volunteering for  local organizations.   However, studies that look specifically at political uses of social network sites  indicate they can have a much greater influence on political attitudes and behav- iors  Kim & Geidner, 2008; Utz, 2009; Valenzuela et al., 2009; Vitak et al.,  2009 . For instance, Kim and Geidner  2008  found that time spent with social  network  sites  had  little  influence  on  increasing  the  benefits  of  voting  and  was  negatively  related  to  perceptions  of  civic  duty.  On  the  other  hand,  political  online social network use  i.e., measures of visiting candidate profiles on a social  network  site  and  sending  messages  to  the  candidate   both  increased  the  per- ceived benefits of voting as well as some of the variables linked to the perception  that voting is rewarding, such as self- efficacy, bridging social capital, and civic  duty. Similarly, while Vitak and associates  2009  found that both political activ- ity on Facebook and exposure to Facebook political activity predicted offline and  online  political  behavior,  the  intensity  of  Facebook  activity  was  actually  nega- tively  related.  The  researchers  also  found  that  political  knowledge,  political  interest, and political participation predicted political activity on Facebook.   These results suggest that, among general social network users, reliance on  these  sites  does  not  greatly  boost  political  involvement,  although  it  could  increase  civic  involvement  because  of  the  social  nature  of  these  sites.  But,    Social Network Sites and Civic Engagement    187  among  those  already  interested  in  election  campaigns,  reliance  on  social  network sites may increase the likelihood that they seek out political informa- tion.  As  Vitak  and  associates   2009   suggest,  Facebook  may  also  provide  a  comfortable environment for those not normally engaged in politics to explore  political activity because they see their friends engaged in political behavior on  Facebook, which, in turn, translates into offline political participation.  YouTube and Political Engagement  The relationship between the use of YouTube and political participation bears  some further discussion due to the characteristics of YouTube that set it apart  from  other  social  network  sites.  First  and  foremost,  YouTube  is  focused  on  video sharing while other social network sites, although capable of video sharing,  focus more on relationship building and maintaining interaction with other users;  this includes sharing multimedia, but is not limited to videos. Second, sites such  as Facebook and LinkedIn require the user to have their own account  i.e., to  create a profile in the networked space  in order to view and interact with other  users and user content. YouTube is different in that, while users may create a  profile on their site to manage content  i.e., upload, favorite, rate, and comment  on videos , other Internet users can visit the site and view content without creat- ing  a  YouTube  profile.  Additionally,  visitors  to  YouTube  who  do  not  have  accounts  can  still  share  content  off- site  by  copying  and  pasting  the  URLs  of  YouTube videos into emails along with commentary in the body of the message  that contextualizes the video much in the same way registered users can share  and  comment  on  videos  on  the  YouTube  site  itself.  Therefore,  YouTube  acts  both  as  a  space  for  establishing  and  maintaining  a  social  network  as  well  as  a  channel for consuming video content without directly taking part in the site’s  social  network.  This  makes  the  content  on  YouTube  accessible  to  a  broader  online audience beyond only Internet users who have YouTube accounts.   A third important distinction between YouTube and other social network  sites is that the networks on sites such as Facebook and MySpace often  though  not  exclusively   feature  interactions  between  users  who  also  have  interper- sonal  connections  offline,  potentially  resulting  in  homogeneous  networks  of  likeminded  individuals  interacting  with  one  another  in  the  networked  space   boyd & Ellison, 2007; Lampe, Ellison, & Steinfield, 2006 . This is relevant to  our  study  because  political  discussion  that  takes  place  with  likeminded  indi- viduals within homogeneous networks serves to reinforce pre- existing political  positions  Cho, 2005 . However, the openly accessible content on YouTube  means that site visitors could be more likely to be exposed to a heterogeneous  online network where other users, content, and opinions reflect a diversity of  political  perspectives.  This  is  important  in  that  exposure  to  heterogeneous    188    Convergent Practices  discussion networks has been linked to increased levels of political participa- tion and political knowledge  Scheufele, Hardy, Brossard, Waismel- Manor, &  Nisbet, 2006 , nurturing dialogue and deliberation  MacKuen, 1990 , and fos- tering understanding and tolerance  Mutz & Mondak, 2006 .   These findings would suggest that social network sites that expose users to  diverse  political  opinions  might  result  in  positive  political  outcomes  such  as  increased  political  participation,  knowledge,  and  discussion  with  others  both  online and offline. However, Zhang et al.  in press  found that social network  sites, including YouTube, did not influence political participation or confidence  in  government,  although  it  did  have  a  positive  effect  on  civic  engagement.  While  their  study  did  not  differentiate  between  YouTube  and  other  social  network sites, this study does, and may help identify whether or not YouTube  influences political participation in a different manner than social network sites.  Such a distinction takes into account  a  the potential demographic and motiva- tional differences in the types of users who frequent social network sites versus  those that visit YouTube and  b  the differences in the degree of network inte- gration required of users seeking to access and share content on those sites.  Social Network Sites and Interpersonal  Discussion  Interpersonal discussion is key to a functioning democracy because of the role  discussion  plays  in  sound  political  deliberation   Brundidge,  2006,  2008;  De  Tocqueville, 1965 . Discussion plays a major role in political learning, attitude  formation,  and  behavior   Huckfeldt  &  Sprague,  1995;  MacKuen  &  Brown,  1987 .  Studies  have  revealed  that  interpersonal  discussion  about  politics  is  related  to  an  increase  in  political  involvement   Calhoun,  1988;  McLeod,  Scheufele, & Moy, 1999 .   Political conversation often facilitates an increased desire to participate in  political  affairs   Katz,  1992   because  the  very  act  of  interacting  with  one  another  helps  to  solidify  opinions.  Deliberation  also  serves  to  empower  cit- izens  Warren, 1992 . Political conversation contributes to the development  of  higher- quality  opinions  because  of  the  refinement  inherent  in  dialogue   Price, Nir, & Cappella, 2002 .   Communication  with  others  can  stimulate  political  activity.  This  is  espe- cially  true  for  local  political  engagement.  Stamm,  Emig,  and  Hesse   1997   suggest a key role of interpersonal discussion as “the primary mechanism for  community  integration.”  Interpersonal  communication  networks  serve  to  promote political participation by providing information regarding how to get  involved, and by conveying a sense of duty and obligation to serve the local  community  Verba, Schlozman, Brady, & Nie, 1995 .   Social Network Sites and Civic Engagement    189    Research indicates that the development of homogeneous social networks  reinforces  existing  political  dispositions,  often  leading  to  more  actively  empowered  political  behavior   Carey,  1989;  Walsh,  2003 .  On  the  other  hand,  a  more  diverse  social  network  stimulates  discussion  of  controversial  topics. Past analyses have found that citizens with more heterogeneous discus- sion networks are more likely to participate in community forums and assorted  political activities  McLeod et al., 1999; Scheufele et al., 2006 . It is apparent  that interpersonal discussion with those of similar and different viewpoints is  related to political activity at many levels.   While  few  studies  have  examined  whether  or  not  discussion  on  social  network  sites  specifically  boosts  offline  political  discussion,  several  social  capital studies have focused on social network sites’ ability to enhance a sense  of  community,  specifically  by  bridging  and  bonding  social  capital.  Bonding  social capital is found between individuals in more tightly knit, homogeneous  communities such as family and friends, and may provide emotional support.  Bridging  social  capital  involves  connecting  more  heterogeneous  groups  of  people to bring about social and political change  Putnam, 2000 .   Studies  suggest  that  social  network  sites  may  increase  both  bonding  and  bridging  social  capital   Ellison  et  al.,  2007,  2010;  Royal,  2008;  Stevens,   Chattopadhyay,  &  Rill,  2008 .  Social  network  users  are  significantly  more  likely to use the sites to connect with someone they already know offline than  meeting new people  Ellison et al., 2010; Mendelson & Papacharissi, 2010 .  They also perceive that the primary audience for their SNS profile is people  they  know  offline,  suggesting  social  network  sites  increase  bonding  social  capital   Ellison  et  al.,  2007,  2010 .  Social  network  sites  also  allow  users  to  join  groups  and  causes  that  could  potentially  connect  them  with  a  diverse  group of people. Nearly 80% of Facebook and MySpace users in one survey  had joined a group  Royal, 2008 , suggesting that social network sites can also  create bridging capital.   Past  research  would  suggest  that  social  networking  behavior  allows  users  access to diverse political opinions that might stimulate political behavior such as  increased interpersonal engagement about politics offline. The increased social  nature of social network sites when compared with YouTube would suggest that  reliance on SNSs may even prove a stronger predictor of face- to-face interper- sonal discussion about political matters.  Social Network Sites in the 2008 Presidential  Campaign  While  social  network  sites  may  not  appear  to  be  a  source  of  political  news  because of their focus on connecting friends, more than half  52%  of social    190    Convergent Practices  network users relied on these sites for political information. In keeping with  the social nature of network sites, the main reasons individuals relied on social  network sites were to discover which candidates their friends voted for  41%   and one- third posted political information for their friends to see. However,  nearly a quarter  23%  used the sites to get campaign information and 16%  started  or  joined  a  political  cause  or  group.  Young  voters,  not  surprisingly,  used social network for political purposes  65%  almost twice as much as those  over 45  36%   Smith, 2009 . Young voters may also use social network sites  differently than older ones, as most see themselves as more than consumers of  news  but  conduits,  emailing  friends  links  and  videos,  and  receiving  them  in  return  Stelter, 2008 .   Political observers have credited Obama’s understanding of social network  sites as not only key to his election, but also in changing the way elections are  conducted. Obama relied on  both mainstream  MySpace and  Facebook   and  niche sites  redandblueamerica, blackplanet  to raise funds, attract volunteers,  and publicize campaign events  Fraser & Dutta, 2008; Stelter, 2008 . Obama  created  his  own  social  network  site,  Mybarackobama.com   MyBO ,  which  allowed voters to create their own blog, join groups of likeminded individuals   such as Texans for Obama , create or find out about Obama- related events,  as well as make phone calls to potential supporters in their neighborhood or  adjoining  states   Fraser  &  Dutta,  2008;  Sanchez,  2008 .  Political  observers  also credited Obama’s huge advantage in attracting campaign funds and volun- teers  for  defeating  Hillary  Clinton  in  the  primaries  and  John  McCain  in  the  general  election  campaign  in  part  to  his  skilled  use  of  social  network  sites.  Obama  signed  up  2.4  million  Facebook  users  as  supporters,  compared  with  just  624,000  for  McCain.  Facebook  helped  attract  new,  young  voters  who  provided Obama with his margin of victory. The number of voters under 30  rose by 3.4 million from 2004 to 2008 and about 66% of those voters sup- ported Obama  Sanchez, 2008 .   The use of social network sites represented a change from the usual top-  down campaign style to a much more grass- roots campaign that empowered  voters by focusing more on putting volunteers in contact with each other than  with  the  Obama  campaign.  As  CNN  analyst  Leslie  Sanchez   2008   noted,  “Web- based political social networking requires empowerment—introducing  well- trained,  highly  motivated  local  supporters  to  one  another  and  then  turning the campaign over to them.”   Obama’s SNS strategy allowed him to raise about 50% more than McCain  in the first six months of 2008, with almost 88% coming online and with two  million donations of less than $200. Thus, Obama could spend more time on  the campaign trail and less time on the phones begging for donations  Holahan,  2008 .   Social Network Sites and Civic Engagement    191    Social  network  sites  not  only  served  as  a  campaign  tool  for  candidates.  Social  networks,  both  alone  and  partnered  with  media  organizations,  also  worked  to  involve  and  inform  voters.  For  instance,  Facebook  launched  a  forum  to  encourage  online  debates  and  partnered  with  ABC  for  election  coverage  and  political  forums.  On  Election  Day,  Facebook  posted  an  online  virtual ticker that urged users to go to the polls  Sanchez, 2008 .   Mainstream news organizations are increasingly relying on social network  sites  to  attract  younger  readers  to  their  websites   Emmett,  2008 .  Several  media organizations have created a strong online presence through advertising  and by creating fan pages where members can access news, photos, features,  quizzes,  and  blogs.  Many  other  media  sites,  such  as  CNN,  ABC,  CBS,  and  CNET, have registered for Facebook Connect, which allows users to log onto  participating websites using their Facebook identification to see their friends’  activities on the site as well as broadcast their own actions on those sites to  their Facebook friends  Emmett, 2008 .   Scholars  suggest  that  SNSs  are  successful  in  stimulating  political  activity  because they lower the cost of seeking out political information and sharing it  with friends  Vitak et al., 2009; Wu, 2009 . Vitak and associates  2009 , in  their  study  of  Facebook  use  during  the  2008  presidential  election,  note  that  Facebook easily allows people to connect with politics as they can become a  fan  of  the  candidate,  download  candidate  applications  to  their  profile  page,  share  political  views  through  wall  posts  and  status  updates,  and  join  various  politically oriented groups and causes. Also, SNSs like Facebook add a social  element  to  politics  as  the  site’s  news  feeds  allow  users  to  quickly  share  information  or  links,  or  promote  political  events  with  members  of  one’s  network.  YouTube and the 2008 Elections  Political observers did not have to wait until the 2008 presidential election to  understand  the  importance  of  YouTube  to  political  campaigns.  In  the  2006  midterm election, Virginia Senator George Allen saw his re- election chances  evaporate after a video captured him using the racial epithet “macaca” in refer- ring to one of his aides  Topcik, 2008 .   In the 2008 campaign, online videos became major sources of information  for Internet users. A Pew Internet study found that 45% of American Inter- net  users  and  60%  of  those  who  sought  out  political  information  online  watched online videos during the campaign, watching videos produced both  by  the  candidate  or  news  organizations   50%   as  well  as  user- generated  content   43% .  While  online  video  use  was  highest  among  those  under  30   67% , still four in 10 online political users over the age of 65 viewed online    192    Convergent Practices  videos.  Furthermore,  one- quarter  of  online  political  users  forwarded  the  videos to friends  Smith, 2009 .   YouTube allowed candidates to post speeches and campaign ads directly to  the  public,  unfiltered  by  the  traditional  media   Gueorguieva,  2007;  May,  2008 . Each of the 16 candidates was given a YouTube channel, and seven can- didates  including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton  announced their candi- dacy on YouTube  Grove, 2008 .   But while YouTube provided candidates a platform to present their message  unvarnished to the public, the site also allowed average citizens to create their  own political content. Two YouTube videos, “Crush on Obama” by Obama Girl  and Will.i.am’s “Yes We Can” video clip introduced Obama at the beginning of  his  campaign,  with  both  getting  more  than  10  million  hits   Fraser  &  Dutta,  2008 . On the other hand, videos about Obama’s minister Jeremiah Wright con- demning  America  and  about  Obama’s  “adviser  and  mentor”  William  Ayers  threatened to derail his campaign  Grove, 2008 .   YouTube made everyone with a video camera a potential citizen journalist.  Campaign  gaffes  were  often  captured  by  citizens  attending  campaign  events   May, 2008 . John McCain undoubtedly rued the decision to sing “Bomb Iran”  at a campaign event, a video viewed by more than 1.2 million people  Topcik,  2008 .   Candidates could decide what campaign ads and speeches they would post  online.  However,  they  lost  control  over  the  content  once  it  was  posted.  Hillary Clinton’s ad about the telephone ringing in the White House may have  helped her capture the popular vote in Texas, but it also became fodder for  video parodies. In fact, so many people spoofed the ad that CNN thought the  parodies worth a story.   The media helped bring YouTube politics into the mainstream by partnering  with the video- sharing site. YouTube combined with CNN to sponsor a debate  for  both  parties,  with  the  public  submitting  video  questions.  This  debate attracted a 10% larger audience of 18–34 year olds than any other debate   Topcik, 2008 . On Election Day, YouTube partnered with PBS for Video the  Vote, where more than 3,700 volunteers documented both the voting process in  their community as well as looking to document cases of voter fraud  Video the  Vote, 2008 .  Research Questions  This study examines how YouTube and social network sites influenced polit- ical attitudes and behaviors in the 2008 election campaign. More specifically,  this study will address the following questions:   Social Network Sites and Civic Engagement    193  RQ1: How will the profile of users of social network sites such  as Facebook and MySpace compare to that of users of YouTube  in terms of demographic and political characteristics?  RQ2:  How  well  will   a   reliance  on  social  network  sites  and   b   YouTube for political information predict offline and online polit- ical participation, intent to vote, and reliance on face- to-face dis- cussion after controlling for demographic and political variables?  RQ3:  Will  reliance  on  social  network  sites  or  YouTube  for  political  information  be  a  stronger  predictor  of  political  atti- tudes and behaviors?  Method  Data Collection  An online survey investigating the effects of reliance on YouTube and social  network sites such as Facebook and MySpace on political attitudes and behav- iors was posted from October 23 to November 3, 2008. Politically interested  Internet  users  were  solicited  from  an  online  panel  operated  by  a  major  Western survey research firm. Email invitations were received by 2,309 panel  members encouraging them to participate if they used the Internet to search  for  political  information  and  were  eligible  to  vote  in  the  United  States.  Respondents were also offered an incentive in the form of a cash drawing. This  sample yielded 533 completed surveys with a 23.9% cooperation rate.  Measures  Demographic Variables  This study treated demographics  gender, age, education, income, and race  as  exogenous measures.1 The researchers found that 70.5% of the sample respond- ents  were  female.  The  median  age  was  48  years  old   SD = 12.8 .  On  average,  respondents  reported  having  “some  college”   SD = 1.2 .  Respondents  also  reported  a  median  household  income  between  $40,001  and  $55,000.  Also,  87.7% of the respondents were Caucasians, 1.0% Hispanics, 4.5% African Amer- icans, 3.9% Asians, and 2% Native Americans. The race variable was recoded as a  dummy variable where Caucasians were “1” and non- Caucasians “0.”   194    Convergent Practices  Political Antecedent Variables  The strength of party affiliation was measured with a 10-point scale where 1  meant “very weak party affiliation” and 10 meant “very strong party affiliation.”  Respondents  showed  fairly  strong  party  affiliation,  with  an  average  of  6.6   SD = 2.8 .  Overall,  39.1%  considered  themselves  moderate,  40.1%  con- servative, and 20.8% liberal. Interest  in  politics  was  an  additive  measure  of  two  items:   1   interest  in    politics  in  general  and   2   interest  in  the  presidential  election  on  a  10-point  scale ranging from 1 “absolutely not interested” to 10 “absolutely interested in  politics.”  Respondents  are  moderately  interested  in  politics  in  general   M = 7.0, SD = 2.7 .   Efficacy was an additive measure of six Likert- type items adapted from the  National Election Studies. Respondents were asked the extent to which they  disagreed or agreed with three statements on a five- point scale where 1 meant  “strongly  disagree”  and  5  meant  “strongly  agree”:   1   people  like  me  don’t  have any say about what the government does  reverse coded ;  2  most of our  leaders are devoted to the service of our country;  3  every vote counts in an  election;  4  politicians never tell us what they really think  reverse coded ;   5  I don’t think public officials care much about what people like me think   reverse coded ; and  6  sometimes politics and government seem so compli- cated that a person like me can’t really understand what is going on  reverse  coded   Cronbach’s alpha = 0.70 .  Reliance on New Media  On a five- point scale where 1 meant “don’t rely on at all” and 5 meant “heavily  rely  on,”  respondents  were  asked  the  extent  to  which  they  relied  on  social  network sites  e.g., Facebook or MySpace  and also the extent to which they  relied on YouTube.  Dependent Variables  Respondents were also asked their likelihood of voting in the 2008 presidential  election on a 10-point scale where 1 meant “not at all likely” and 10 meant  “very likely.”   Reliance  on  face- to-face  discussion  for  political  information  was  a  single  item measured on a five- point scale where 1 meant “don’t rely on at all” and 5  meant  “heavily  rely  on.”  Respondents  were  asked  the  extent  to  which  they  relied on face- to-face discussion for political information.   Offline participation was measured by an index of five items adapted from  the National Election Studies, where 1 meant “never” participated and 5 meant    Social Network Sites and Civic Engagement    195  “very often.” Respondents were asked how often they had engaged in a variety  of  political  activities   such  as  wearing  a  campaign  button,  helping  a  political  candidate, giving money to a candidate, attending political meetings, and per- suading others to support a candidate  during the past two years.   On the same five- point scale, online political participation was an additive  measure of seven items taken from the Pew Research Center. The items were:  register your own opinions by participating in an online poll; get information  about a candidate’s voting record; sent or received emails about the candidates  or  campaigns;  contribute  money  online  to  a  candidate  running  for  public  office;  look  for  more  information  online  about  candidates’  positions  on  the  issues; find out about endorsements or ratings of candidates by organizations  or individuals online; and check the accuracy of claims made by or about the  candidates online  Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93 .  Data Analysis Strategies  Data analysis for this study proceeded in two steps. First, crosstabs and means  were run to answer the first research question. Second, hierarchical regression  analyses were conducted to answer the second and third research questions.  Demographics were entered as the first block, followed by political anteced- ents  political efficacy, political interest, strength of party affiliation, and ide- ology .  Reliance  on  social  network  sites  and  reliance  on  YouTube  were  entered as the final block. The results are shown in Tables 9.1–9.6.  Results  The first research question compared and contrasted demographic and political  characteristics  of  the  users  of  social  network  sites  and  those  of  the  users  of  YouTube. Those who never relied on social network sites and YouTube were  dropped from the analysis, which left 189 for users of social network sites and  204  for  users  of  YouTube.  According  to  Tables  9.1–9.3,  users  of  social  network sites and users of YouTube shared similar demographic and political  profiles  with  few  differences.  For  instance,  females  relied  more  heavily  on  social  network  sites   72.5%   and  YouTube   71.6% ,  and  users  were  over- whelmingly  Caucasian  for  both  social  network  sites   80.4%   and  YouTube   83.3% .  Means  and  standard  deviations  were  almost  the  same  for  users  of  social network sites and those of YouTube in terms of age, education, income,  efficacy, political interest, strength of party affiliation, and ideology.   The  second  research  question  examined  the  effects  of  reliance  on  social  network sites and reliance on YouTube on online and offline political partici- pation, intention to vote, and reliance on face- to-face discussion for political    196    Convergent Practices  Table 9.1  Reliance on SNSs and YouTube: Gender crosstabulations  Males  %   Females  %   Total  %   Users of social network sites  Users of YouTube  52  27.5  58  28.4   137  72.5  146  71.6   189  100  204  100   Table 9.2  Reliance on SNSs and YouTube: Race crosstabulations  Non-Caucasians  %   Caucasians  %   Total  %   Users of social network sites  Users of YouTube  37  19.6  34  16.7   152  80.4  170  83.3   189  100  204  100   information after controlling for demographic variables and political anteced- ent variables. As seen in Tables 9.4 and 9.5 after controlling for influences of  demographic  variables  and  political  antecedent  variables,  both  reliance  on  social network sites   β = 0.30, p < 0.001  and reliance on YouTube   β = 0.15,  p < 0.001   were  significant  predictors  of  online  political  participation;  both  were also significant predictors of offline political participation. The more one  relied on YouTube, the less likely one intended to vote, but reliance on social  network sites did not have a significant influence on one’s intention to vote.  Reliance on social network sites was also a significant predictor of reliance on  face- to-face  discussion  for  political  information    β = 0.29,  p < 0.001 ,  while  reliance on YouTube was not   β = 0.02, n.s. . In terms of political antecedent variables, people’s political interest was a    significant predictor of all dependent variables. The more interest people had  in  politics,  the  more  they  would  participate  in  politics  online    β = 0.44,  p < 0.001  and offline   β = 0.31, p < 0.001 ; the more they possessed political  knowledge   β = 0.22, p < 0.001 , the more likely they would vote   β = 0.42,  p < 0.001 , and the more they would rely on face- to-face discussion for polit- ical  information    β = 0.33,  p < 0.001 .  The  stronger  people  were  affiliated  with  their  political  parties,  the  more  they  would  be  active  in  politics  offline    β = 0.08, p < 0.05 , the more likely they would vote   β = 0.27, p < 0.001 ,  and the more they would rely on face- to-face discussion for political informa- tion    β = 0.10,  p < 0.05 .  However,  strength  of  political  affiliation  did  not  have significant influence on online political participation. As for the influence  of ideology, the more conservative people were, the more likely they would  vote   β = –0.09, p < 0.05 . However, ideology did not have significant impact  on online and offline political participation or reliance on face- to-face discus- sion for political information. People’s political efficacy was not a significant  predictor of any dependent variable.     l a r e b  i l   y r e  v  = 5  l    e a c s   t n o p - 0 1    i    e e r g a   y l g n o r t  s  = 5    s t n e m e r c n  i  l  i    ; e a c s   t n o p - 5     y g o o e d I  l    , e v i t a v r e s n o c   y r e  v  = 1    y t r a p   f o   h t g n e r t S      n o i t a  i l  fi f a      t s e r e t n i   l a c i t i l  o P  l    e a c s   t n o p - 0 1    i  i  l    , e a c s   t n o p - 5     y c a c fi f E    , e e r g a s i d   y l g n o r t  s  = 1  ,    0 0 0 0 1 $   n o   e a c s  l  i    t n o p - 8     e m o c n I  l      e a c s   t n o p - 6    i    n o i t a c u d E  e g A  .    2 1     8 2  .  .    5 2     7 6  .  .    6 2     3 7  .  .    6 0     0 3  .  .    2 2     0 4  .  .    1 1     3 3  .  .    1 4 1     9 3 4  .  .    2 1     7 2  .  .    4 2     9 6  .  .    6 2     3 7  .  .    6 0     0 3  .  .    1 2     0 4  .  .    2 1     3 3  .  .    0 4 1     1 5 4  .    l a i  c o s   f o   s r e s U    s e t i s   k r o w t e n    f o   s r e s U  e b u T u o Y  s n o i t a i  v e d   d r a d n a t s   d n a   s n a e M  .    3 9   e b a T  l   198    Convergent Practices  Table 9.4  Hierarchical regression analyses predicting online and offline participation  Online political  participation  Offline political  participation  Demographics Gender  female coded higher  Age  Education Income Race  Caucasian coded higher  R2  %  Political antecedents Efficacy Political interest Strength of political affiliation Ideology  liberal coded higher  Incremental R2  %   Reliance on new media Reliance on social network sites Reliance on YouTube Incremental R2  %  Total R2  %   Note *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.  –0.09** –0.01 0.09* 0.06 0.08* 7.6***  –0.04 0.44*** 0.04 –0.04 25.2***  0.30*** 0.15** 16.5*** 49.3***  –0.09* 0.05 0.05 0.07 0.04 5.7***  0.01 0.31*** 0.08* 0.06  17.9***  0.30*** 0.22*** 20.4*** 44.0***    In regards to demographic variables, male respondents were more likely to  participate  in  politics  online    β = –0.09,  p < 0.01,  female  coded  higher   and  offline   β = –0.09, p < 0.01, female coded higher . Gender was not a significant  predictor of intention to vote or reliance on face- to-face discussion for political  information.  People  with  more  education  were  more  likely  to  participate  in  political activities online   β = 0.09, p < 0.05  but not offline; however, education  did not have an influence on intention to vote or reliance on face- to-face discus- sion for political information. More- wealthy people relied on face- to-face discus- sion for political information   β = 0.10, p < 0.05 ; however, income was not a  significant  predictor  of  any  of  the  remaining  dependent  variables.  Caucasians  were more likely to participate in politics online   β = 0.08, p < 0.05 , but did  not appear to influence any of the remaining dependent variables.   The third research question examined whether reliance on social network sites  or reliance on YouTube was a stronger predictor of political attitudes and behav- iors. As seen in the semi- partial correlations between reliance on social network  sites and YouTube and the five dependent variables, with the exception of voter  intention,  reliance  on  social  network  sites  had  larger  semi- partial  correlation   coefficients  with  all  other  dependent  variables  than  reliance  on  YouTube    Social Network Sites and Civic Engagement    199  Table 9.5   Predicting  intention  to  vote,  and  reliance  on  face-to-face  discussion  for   information  Intention to vote  Reliance on face-to-face  discussion for information  Demographics Gender  female coded higher  Age  Education Income Race  Caucasian coded higher  R2  %  Political antecedents Efficacy Political interest Strength of political affiliation Ideology  liberal coded higher  Incremental R2  %   Reliance on new media Reliance on social network sites Reliance on YouTube Incremental R2  %  Total R2  %   Note *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.  –0.03 0.04 0.05 0.04 0.06 9.1***  –0.003 0.42*** 0.27*** –0.09* 30.5***  0.04 –0.15** 1.5*** 41.1***  0.04 –0.02 0.01 0.10* 0.04 3.9**  0–.04 0.33*** 0.10* 0.02  16.0***  0.29*** 0.02 8.5*** 28.4***   Table 9.6 . For instance, reliance on social network sites was significantly related  to online political participation   β = 0.21, p < 0.001  as opposed to reliance on  YouTube   β = 0.10, p < 0.01 ; reliance on social network sites was also signifi- cantly  related  to  offline  political  participation    β = 0.20,  p < 0.001   compared  with reliance on YouTube   β = 0.15, p < 0.001 . Reliance on social network sites  was significantly related to reliance on face- to-face discussion for political informa- tion   β = 0.20, p < 0.001  as opposed to reliance on YouTube   β = 0.02, n.s. .  Furthermore,  those  with  greater  reliance  on  YouTube  were  less  likely  to  vote    β = –0.10, p < 0.001 , while reliance on social network sites was not significantly  related  to  voting  intentions.  Overall,  reliance  on  social  network  sites  was  a  stronger predictor of political attitudes and behavior than reliance on YouTube.   Overall,  then,  studies  suggest  that  while  SNS  users  and  YouTube  users  were  similar  on  demographic  measures,  they  differed  more  substantially  on  their  ability  to  influence  political  attitudes  and  behaviors.  Reliance  on  social  network  sites  proved  to  be  more  strongly  related  to  political  measures  than  YouTube in four of five cases. YouTube was a stronger predictor of intention  to vote than SNS reliance, but the relationship between YouTube and inten- tion to vote was negative.   200    Convergent Practices  Table 9.6   Semi-partial correlations between reliance on social network sites and reli-  ance on YouTube and five dependent variables  Online political  participation  Offline political  participation  Intention   to vote  Reliance on   face-to-face  discussion  Reliance on SNSs Reliance on YouTube  0.21*** 0.10**  0.20*** 0.15***    0.03 n.s. 0.20*** 0.02 n.s. –0.10**  Note  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.  Discussion  Several pundits declared 2008 the Facebook election because of how Barack  Obama skillfully used a variety of social network sites as well as YouTube to  engineer a successful grass- roots movement to attract the volunteers and funds  necessary  to  win  the  election   Fraser  &  Dutta,  2008;  Grove,  2008;  Stelter,  2008 .  However,  few  scholars  have  examined  whether  social  network  sites  and YouTube predict political attitudes and behaviors necessary for a demo- cracy to function.   Researchers often lump YouTube in with social network sites such as MySpace  and Facebook because it meets many of the characteristics of a social network site.  Specifically, YouTube, like social network sites, allows you to construct a public  or  semi- public  profile  as  well  as  connect  with  friends   boyd  &  Ellison,  2007;  Lange,  2007 .  However,  this  study  separated  YouTube  from  SNSs  because  it  focused on one network activity, video sharing, and because most sites such as  Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn require people to create an account. Internet  users can visit YouTube, view its content, and share it with others without creat- ing an account. While YouTube and social network sites may function differently,  this study found that they attract a very similar audience. Those who relied on  both  YouTube  and  social  network  sites  were  overwhelmingly  female,  had  attended some college, and had earned an average annual income of $40,001– $55,000.  Both  were  moderately  efficacious  and  reported  fairly  high  political  interest.  The  respondents  only  differed  slightly  on  other  measures.  YouTube  users  were  marginally  more  likely  to  be  Caucasian   83.3%  to  80.4% ,  were  somewhat older  45.1 to 43.9 years old  and reported slightly higher support for  their political parties  6.9% to 6.7% . Thus, while YouTube may function differ- ently from other types of social network sites, it attracts similar types of people.   This  finding  is  not  surprising  due  to  the  conceptual  overlap  between  the  activities of both users of Facebook and YouTube. Convergent media use has  become  the  norm  online,  with  many  users  cross- posting  and  seamlessly    Social Network Sites and Civic Engagement    201  communicating in multiple platforms. Links are often present connecting one  site to the next, and in many cases accounts can be managed that allow singular  status updates to appear on multiple profiles. This thrust toward user integra- tion of varied sites will likely perpetuate the similarity of users among all types  of social network sites. Future study will be needed to further understand con- vergent social media consumption and the motivations for such behavior.   Research on political uses of social network sites has focused on its ability  to create social capital  Ellison et al., 2007, 2010; Royal, 2008; Steinfield et  al., 2008; Valenzuela et al., 2009  because studies suggest that people employ  social network sites primarily to remain in contact with existing friends and to  learn more about people they meet both offline and online  boyd & Ellison,  2007, Ellison et al., 2010; Lampe et al., 2006 . Indeed, in the current study,  both reliance on YouTube and social networks predicted civic political behav- iors, namely offline political activity  e.g., helping a political candidate, attend- ing political meetings, and persuading others to support a candidate , online  political  activity   e.g.,  contacting  candidates  online,  sending  and  receiving  campaign  emails,  and  making  online  contributions ,  and  getting  information  about the campaign through face- to-face communication. This parallels results  from an earlier study  Zhang et al., in press  that found social network use was  more closely linked to civic participation  e.g., volunteering for a local gov- ernment board, working with others in the community to solve community  problems,  or  helping  to  form  a  group  to  solve  community  problems .  This  study also supported a Pew Internet study that found of those who used social  network sites for campaign information, most used it for social purposes such  as  to  discover  which  candidates  their  friends  voted  for  and  to  post  political  information for their friends to see. Fewer social network users employed the  sites to get campaign information  Smith, 2009 .   Surprisingly, in the current study reliance on social network sites did not  boost intention to vote. Political observers indicated that Obama had a domi- nating presence on social network sites and used them as a mechanism to get  people involved in his campaign  Fraser & Dutta, 2008; Grove, 2008; Stelter,  2008 . Most political groups in social networks voice a clear perspective, such  as Barack Obama  “One Million Strong for Barack”  or LIFE: “Let’s see how  many pro- life people are on Facebook?” Just as studies suggest that, increas- ingly,  people  are  seeking  out  political  websites  and  blogs  that  support  their  political views  Johnson, Bichard, & Zhang, 2009; Johnson, Zhang, & Bichard,  2008; Stroud 2006, 2007, 2008 , perhaps people who already know who they  are going to vote for join Facebook groups sympathetic to that candidate so  that they can be in discussions with likeminded individuals and get involved in  the campaign itself. Social networking sites appear to attract more homogen- eous interaction and are less likely to predict intention to vote. The current    202    Convergent Practices  findings suggest that voting behavior is more likely predicted by political varia- bles  such  as  ideology,  strength  of  party  affiliation,  offline  political  participa- tion, and political knowledge.   The results for intention to vote were even more disheartening with respect  to  YouTube.  In  fact,  the  more  you  watched  YouTube,  the  less  you  were  inclined to vote. YouTube may have reduced the intent to vote because, while  each  candidate  was  allowed  to  post  their  videos  promoting  their  candidacy   Gueorguieva,  2007;  May,  2008 ,  YouTube  also  made  it  easier  to  attack  a  political opponent, as one does not have to approve the message as is required  on television. Also, while some videos posted by others outside the campaign  praised the candidate  e.g., Williams’ “Yes We Can Video” , often such out- sider videos attacked the candidate, captured their gaffes on the campaign trail  or parodied the candidates’ ads and campaign message  Grove, 2008; Topcik,  2008 . This abundance of divergent messages may have frustrated viewers to  the point of inaction or simply provided entertainment to those with no inten- tion to vote in the first place.   This study found that social network sites consistently proved a better pre- dictor  of  political  attitudes  and  behaviors  than  YouTube,  even  though  more  people  relied  on  YouTube  for  information  about  the  election  than  social  network sites  204 vs. 189 , and the demographic and political profiles of the  two types of site users were similar. Differences were particularly acute for  online  political  participation  and  reliance  on  face- to-face  discussion.  Social  network  sites  may  have  had  a  greater  influence  on  political  behavior  than  YouTube because social network sites focus on building and maintaining per- sonal relationships through online discussion. Studies suggest that political dis- cussion  plays  a  major  role  in  political  learning,  attitude  formation,  and  behavior  Huckfeldt & Sprague, 1995; MacKuen & Brown, 1987 , including  an increase in political involvement  McLeod et al., 1999 .   Not  surprisingly,  political  measures,  particularly  political  interest  and  strength of party affiliation, generally dwarfed reliance on social network sites  and YouTube as predictors of political attitudes and behaviors. However, reli- ance on social network sites and YouTube proved a more powerful predictor  of offline political participation than political antecedents, demonstrating the  need for continued study on the link between social network sites and political  measures, particularly measures that involve civic engagement.  Limitations and Future Studies  This study relied on an online panel of Internet users from a leading Western  research firm. While such a panel holds advantages to a convenience sample  of  online  users,  such  as  knowing  the  demographic  characteristics  of  the    Social Network Sites and Civic Engagement    203  population,  this  is  still  a  self- selected  group  of  Internet  users.  Therefore,  results cannot be generalized to Internet users in general or social network  users  in  particular.  Less  than  half  of  the  respondents  said  they  used  social  network  sites  for  political  information.  Future  studies  may  want  to  survey  social network users directly to better understand how social network reli- ance influences political attitudes and behaviors.   Papacharissi and Mendelson  2008  found that motives for visiting Facebook  influenced social capital measures. Such a study could be expanded to look at  how  motives  for  using  social  network  sites  influence  political  attitudes  and  behaviors. Motives for using multiple social media platforms at the same time  could also be measured in an effort to understand convergent media activity. It  would be interesting to discover the underlying gratifications for social behavior  online and the implications in the offline world. This study focused on political  attitudes and behaviors, but an earlier study by Zhang and associates  in press   suggested that social network sites had a greater influence on civic participation  than political participation. Because of the social nature of social network sites,  future studies could include measures of local civic engagement.   Finally,  this  study  looked  at  reliance  on  social  network  sites  in  general,  although  studies  suggest  that  different  social  network  sites  attract  different  audiences,  with  some  social  networks   e.g.,  AsianAve,  LDS  Linkup  for  Mormons  geared to very specific audiences. Therefore, future studies might  want to further examine how specific social network sites have differing influ- ences on political attitudes and behaviors.  Note  1.  For  gender,  the  research  lab  panel  demographics  were  47.1%  male  and  52.9%  female. However, our sample yielded 29.5% male and 70.5% female. The educa- tion profile for the majority of respondents on the Media Research Lab panel indi- cated  some  college  up  to  a  four- year  degree.  The  majority  of  our  sample  also  reported  some  college  up  to  a  four- year  degree.  Therefore,  our  sample  closely  resembled the population on gender and level of education, but is older than the  panel population as a whole.  References  boyd, d. m.  2004 .

The revolution will  be networked: The influence of social network sites on political attitudes and behav- iors. Social Science Computer Review.   Chapter 10 Between Barack and a Net Place Motivations for Using Social  Network Sites and Blogs for  Political Information  Barbara K. Kaye  Introduction  Blogs emerged as 2004 election season must- reads, with bloggers leading the  charge for and against candidates and issues. Recognizing the need to use the  Internet to connect to his supporters, Senator Howard Dean was the first pres- idential candidate to create a blog. Dean’s blog and his strategy of using the  blogosphere  to  raise  money,  mobilize  supporters,  generate  excitement,  and  spread the word about his campaign was so successful in boosting his popular- ity that the mainstream media heralded it as a campaign revolution  Nagour- ney, 2008; Stromer- Galley & Baker, 2006 .   By the 2008 presidential election, online politics had changed. Most notable  was  the  emergence  of  social  network  sites   SNSs 1  such  as  Facebook  and  MySpace. Not only were these new venues social gathering spaces, they were  also used by campaigners as a means of connecting to political constituents and  creating political links among SNS users. Presidential hopeful Senator Barack  Obama was heralded for his clever campaigning on blogs, social network sites  and YouTube to organize supporters, raise money, and get his message out to  voters  Nagourney, 2008 . In contrast, Senator John McCain was dubbed the  “analog candidate” for minimizing the importance of blogs and SNSs. Strate- gists mused whether his scant digital presence alienated the younger, online-  savvy voters  Leibovich, 2008 .   Even though the campaign of 2008 is long over, blogs and SNSs continue as  the  newest  and  hottest  online  arenas  for  scrutinizing  political  happenings   Stelter  &  Perez- Pena,  2008 .  But  the  creation  of  online  content  is  of  small  matter without a large, enthusiastic audience to use the technology to its full  potential. The number of SNS and blog users alone begs the question of what  draws  them  to  online  sources,  especially  for  political  information.  The  per- centage of adults who sought online information about politics or a presiden- tial election jumped from 4% in 1996 to 29% in 2004 to 44% in 2008  Smith,    Between Barack and a Net Place    209  2009 . Much of that increase is attributed to blogs, which took hold as a strong  political presence in 2004, and SNSs, which caught on in 2008.   Who are these users and why do they long for social network interactions  and eagerly swig down blog content? This study sets out to answer these ques- tions  within  the  uses  and  gratifications  framework.  Specifically,  this  chapter  explores the motivations for using SNSs and blogs for political information and  compares the demographic and political characteristics of SNSs and blog users  who  completed  an  online  survey  during  the  two  weeks  before  and  the  two  weeks after the 2008 presidential election.  Using Social Network Sites and Blogs to  Disseminate Political Information  Candidates  for  political  office  were  experimenting  with  their  own  blogs  in  2004. By the 2006 mid- term elections, and certainly by the 2008 presidential  campaign, candidate blogs were commonplace. Senator John McCain, a rare  Internet holdout among major candidates, told reporters that, “I don’t expect  to set up my own blog”  Leibovich, 2008 . Some candidates, such as Senator  Hillary  Clinton,  hired  prominent  political  bloggers  to  build  an  online  image  campaign  Hernandez, 2006 . The necessity to set up blogs and bring political  bloggers into the campaign camp signifies the growing importance of the influ- ence of both candidate- and blogger- hosted blogs.   Campaigners also relied on social network sites and other Web 2.02 appli- cations to drum up support. Barack Obama led the way with his heavy use of  SNSs, which pundits claim contributed to his victory in what they dubbed the  “Facebook  Effect”   Fraser  &  Dutta,  2008 .  Obama’s  new  communication  media team, led by Facebook founder Chris Hughes, masterminded an online  crusade on Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, Twitter, and other social network  sites,  and  established  connections  from  these  sites  to  mybarackobama.com   Fraser & Dutta, 2008  also known as MyBo  Stelter, 2008b . The success of  the Obama team’s online strategies is evidenced by the number of users: one  million  Facebook  and  MySpace  friends;  112,000  Twitter  followers;  18  million views of 1,800 videos on the BarackObama.com channel; 3.4 million  YouTube  views  of  Obama’s  speech  about  race;  900,000  MyBo  members   Fraser  &  Dutta,  2008;  Stelter,  2008a,  2008b .  Senator  McCain  also  deployed an online campaign, but it was not as successful as Obama’s. The  JohnMcCain.com channel held only about 300 videos and attracted just over  28,000  subscribers  and  eked  out  slightly  more  than  two  million  visits.  McCain’s weaker numbers could be an indication that Web 2.0 use is influ- enced  by  user  characteristics  and  political  attitudes,  with  younger,  more  liberal voters connecting online.   210    Convergent Practices  What is a Social Network Site? What is a Blog?  Who Uses Them?  Social  network  sites  are  typically  used  as  one- stop  venues  for  sending  email,  photos, and videos to “friends,” who are those who have been allowed access to  someone’s SNS page. These friends then may interact with each other, thus creat- ing  and  expanding  existing  social  ties.  Blogs  are  diary- styled  venues  that  offer  news and information posted by a blogger and to which readers may add their  own opinions and begin discussion on new topics.   SNSs  and  blogs  share  similar  characteristics:  they  offer  news  and  opinion,  promote discussion and community, are online venues for communicating with  others and for making new online friends, and connect users with similar interests  and viewpoints. Yet SNSs and blogs differ in their structure and perhaps in their  purposes. Blogs tout themselves as providers of information and opinion, whereas  SNSs tend to be perceived as places to widen social circles, to make friends, and  to find personal information. Blogs promote cognitive processes while SNSs are  more emotional and social. More importantly, user participation on blogs is not  crucial. Blog users may participate heavily by commenting and sending links to  more information sources, or they may simply read blog postings and not interact  at all. The purpose of SNSs, however, is to connect with others; therefore, user  participation is paramount. Without two- way communication there is not much  point  to  social  network  sites   boyd  &  Ellison,  2007;  Joinson,  2008;  Lampe,  Ellison, & Steinfield, 2006; Lange, 2007; Murchu, Breslin, & Decker, 2004 .   Blogs splashed into cyberspace after the 9 11 attacks and the war in Iraq as  people sought personal and in- depth accounts of the events. As blog readership  jumped to about 50% of those living in the U.S., the number of blogs exploded  from  about  50  in  1999   Levy,  2002   to  an  estimated  70  million  worldwide  in  2007  The State of the News Media, 2008 , to 133 million only one year later, as  tracked by Technorati  Internet 2008 in Numbers, 2009 . Social network use also surged. The percentage of adult Internet users with an    SNS profile quadrupled from 8% in 2005 to 35% by the end of 2008  Lenhart,  2009 . But more astounding than percentages is the sheer number of SNS users.  MySpace boasts of over 100 million users  Joinson, 2008  and Facebook claims  400 million registrants  Facebook Statistics, 2010 . These numbers translate into  about  65  million  unique  visitors  per  month  on  MySpace  and  a  staggering  93  million stopping in on Facebook  Shapira, 2009; Sydell, 2009 .  Demographic and Political Characteristics of  Users of SNSs and Blogs  As with other Web 2.0 applications, SNSs are dominated by young people— between 75%–83% of those between the ages of 18–24 have a profile. Two-    Between Barack and a Net Place    211  thirds of those with a profile also engaged in some form of political activity or  discussion on SNSs during the 2008 campaign  Lenhart, 2009; Smith, 2009 .   Young people also dominate the blogosphere, with just over three- quarters of  those between the ages of 18–24 reporting they have read blogs  The State of  the News Media, 2008 , but more specifically, 42% of those between the ages of  18–29 read political campaign blogs  Pew Research Center, 2008b .   Men  are  more  likely  than  woman  to  seek  political  information  from  blogs   Rainie & Horrigan, 2005; Salwen, Garrison, & Driscoll, 2005 . About half of  men  visit  political  blogs  compared  to  one- third  of  women   Connelly,  2007 .  Male  blog  users  tend  to  be  young  and  highly  educated  with  high  incomes   Eveland & Dylko, 2007; Graf, 2006; Johnson, Kaye, Bichard, & Wong, 2007;  Kaye & Johnson, 2004a, 2004b; Perlmutter, 2008; Rainie, 2005 .   Political attitudes have been linked to using SNSs and blogs. Although liberals  and conservatives are equally likely to go online  Horrigan, Garrett, & Resnick,  2004; Kohut, 2004 , SNSs seem to be inhabited by more liberal users. Those  affiliated  with  the  Democratic  party  are  more  likely  than  Republicans  to  have  created an online profile—36% vs. 21%  Smith & Ranie, 2008 .   Studies of the political ideology of blog users show inconsistent results. Some  studies  indicate  that  blog  users  are  Republican  and  conservative   Johnson  &  Kaye, 2004; Johnson et al., 2007; Kaye & Johnson, 2004b, 2006 , some find  they are equally liberal and conservative  Eveland & Dylko, 2007; State of the  News  Media,  2007 ,  and  others  suggest  that  blog  users  are  more  likely  to  be  liberal   Blogads,  2006;  Blog  Reader,  2007   by  a  two- to-one  margin   43%  to  22%   Pew Research Center, 2008b .   Those  who  read  blogs  tend  to  distrust  the  government  and  media   Graf,  2006; Johnson & Kaye, 2007b; Kaye & Johnson, 2004b , but they also report  high  levels  of  self- efficacy,  the  belief  that  they  have  the  power  to  bring  about  governmental change  Johnson & Kaye, 2004, 2007b , as do SNS users  Posteln- icu & Cozma, 2007 . SNS users were also very interested in the 2008 presiden- tial campaign  Postelnicu & Cozma, 2007 , and those who use social network  tools are also more likely to read blogs  Smith, 2009 . A study conducted during  the time of the 2004 presidential campaign found that nine of 10 blog users were  very  interested  in  and  knowledgeable  about  the  election.  Three- quarters  reported  very  high  interest  in  politics  and  two- thirds  claimed  they  were  very  knowledgeable about politics in general  Kaye & Johnson, 2006 .  Using Social Network Sites and Blogs for  Political Information  During the 2008 presidential election, the Internet captured almost as many  U.S.  adult  users  as  newspapers  for  campaign  news   26%  vs.  28%    Smith,    212    Convergent Practices  2009 . Moreover, almost three- quarters  74%  of Internet users connected to  online sources specifically to get news and information about the 2008 cam- paign  Smith, 2009 .   Underscoring the importance of blogs and social network sites for political  information  is  the  percentage  of  online  users  who  rely  on  these  sites—26%  visit blogs that cover news, politics, or media and 40% read someone else’s  commentary about the campaign on an online news group, website, or blog   Smith, 2009 , even though only about one in 10 blogs is politically- oriented   Horrigan,  2007 .  Additionally,  almost  one  in  five   18%   of  online  users  posted opinions, comments, or questions about the 2008 campaign on SNSs or  blogs  Smith, 2009 , and 10% have used SNSs such as Facebook or MySpace  to  gather  political  information  or  to  become  politically  involved   Smith  &  Rainie, 2008 .  Applying Uses and Gratifications to Social  Network Sites and Blogs  As a significant percentage of online users turn to blogs and SNSs for political  information, the question of why they do so arises. Since the early 1990s, aca- demic researchers have been studying the uses and gratifications for using the  Internet  as  a  whole.  As  new  online  components  emerge   e.g.,  chat,  blogs,  SNSs , attention turns toward understanding the motivations for using these  new sources. The basic premise of uses and gratifications theory is that users  are  active  and  goal- directed,  thus  they  are  aware  of  the  needs  that  they  are  attempting to satisfy  Lin & Jeffres, 1998; Palmgreen, 1984 . The approach is  from a user perspective—what people do with the media, not what the media  do to people.   Academic  research  indicates  that,  although  different  components  of  the  Internet  Web, chat, bulletin boards, email, blogs  satisfy many of the same  needs, each also gratifies needs unique to a particular online resource. Users  are motivated to connect to websites in general to pass the time, to be enter- tained,  to  escape,  and  to  make  social  connections   Charney  &  Greenberg,  2001; Eighmey, 1997; Ferguson & Perse, 2000; Kaye, 1998; Papacharissi &  Rubin, 2000 . Chatrooms serve social contact, personal identity, and expres- sion  needs   Fuentes,  2000;  Kaye  &  Johnson,  2006;  Turkle,  1999 ,  bulletin  boards electronic  mailing  lists  tend  to  gratify  information education  and  social  needs   James,  Wotring,  &  Forrest,  1995;  Kaye  &  Johnson,  2004a,  2006 ,  and  email  satisfies  interpersonal  needs   Dimmick,  Kline,  &  Stafford,  2000; Stafford, Kline, & Dimmick, 1999  and convenience needs  Papacharissi  & Rubin, 2000 . Just as different online components serve unique needs, the  same may be true of SNSs and blogs.   Between Barack and a Net Place    213  Motivations for Using Social Network Sites Research  has  identified  uses  and  gratifications  of  most  Internet  components,  but  because  SNSs  and  blogs  are  relatively  new,  the  reasons  people  seek  information from them requires further study.   New  SNS  users  typically  set  up  individual  profiles  and  then  identify  and  display names, photos, and videos of others with whom they have a relation- ship.  Displaying  the  “friends”  list  establishes  one’s  popularity  and  motivates  users to email or otherwise connect to their friend’s friends, thus expanding  their own networks  boyd & Ellison, 2007 . Researchers have found that SNSs  are used mainly to keep in touch with friends, to make new friends  Raacke &  Bonds- Raacke,  2008 ,  for  social  surveillance,  and  for  tracking  those  within  their group  Joinson, 2008; Lampe et al., 2006 .   Newer research has found that social network sites are also used to gather  political  information.  This  shift  was  especially  predominant  during  the  2008  election campaign. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center disclosed  that 40% of all social network users and 50% of those under the age of 30 used  SNSs to obtain or share information about politics and the campaigns. Specifi- cally, 29% of SNS users purposively sought out their friends’ political interests  or affiliations, and 22% looked for information about a candidate or campaign   Smith & Rainie, 2008 .  Motivations for Using Blogs Blogs began as online diaries used to keep in touch with friends and family, a  role since assumed by SNSs. Blogs have evolved from simple diaries read only  by  an  inner  circle  of  contacts  to  powerful  forums  that  address  many  issues.  Blogs are now used for a multitude of reasons, such as to share opinions and  become  politically  involved   Haigh  &  Pfau,  2007;  Hebert,  2004;  Reynolds,  2004 .  Blogs  are  also  used  because  they  are  a  convenient  way  to  become  informed, for political, social, and media surveillance, for personal fulfillment  and expression affiliation, and because they offer different and more insightful  perspectives on events than traditional media, which is held in distain by many  blog  readers   Johnson  &  Kaye,  2006,  2007b,  2009;  Johnson  et  al.,  2007;  Kaye, 2005, 2007, 2008; Kaye & Johnson, 2006 .  Study Goals This study examines the users and uses of SNSs and blogs for political informa- tion.  Because  these  two  online  sources  differ  on  their  purposes  and  levels  of  interactivity, they are likely to satisfy different gratifications and draw users for  different purposes. Therefore, this study explores the following two questions:   214    Convergent Practices  1.  What are the demographic and political characteristics of individuals who   heavily use only SNSs and blogs for political information?  2.  What  motivates  individuals  to  heavily  rely  only  on  SNSs  and  blogs  for   political information?  Method  A  survey  targeted  to  politically  interested  Internet  users  was  posted  online  during the two weeks before and the two weeks after the 2008 presidential  election. Following the same method used in other published studies  Johnson  &  Kaye,  2004,  2007a,  2009;  Kaye,  2005,  2007;  Kaye  &  Johnson,  2004b ,  politically  interested  Internet  users  were  solicited  to  fill  out  the  survey  by  placing  an  announcement  containing  the  survey  URL  on  hundreds  of  politi- cally oriented websites, blogs, and social network sites that represented a cross  section of political ideologies.3   After completion of the survey, respondents were encouraged to “snowball”  it  Babbie, 2002; Witte, Amoroso, & Howard, 2000  to politically interested  friends  and  family  by  clicking  on  a  link  that  automatically  forwarded  it.  This  convenience sample of politically interested Internet users yielded 4,241 com- pleted  surveys.4 The  survey  software  allowed  computation  of  a  cooperation  rate5 by recording the number of individuals who accessed the survey and the  number who completed it. For this survey, the cooperation rate was 26.2%.   Survey questions assessed respondent demographics  gender, age, income,  education   and  political  characteristics  including  political  party,  strength  of  party  ties,  political  ideology,  trust  in  the  government,  self- efficacy,  political  knowledge, political interest, knowledge of the 2008 presidential campaign,  and  interest  in  the  2008  political  campaign.   Detailed  operationalization  is  available in the “Notes” section of this chapter.6   Data Analysis  First, responses to the reliance question  “How much do you rely on . . . ?”  for  social  network  sites  and  blogs  were  re- coded  into  two  separate  categories.  Those who “relied” or “heavily relied” on a component were classified as “high  reliance,”  and  those  who  marked  “sometimes  rely  on,”  “rarely  rely  on,”  and  “don’t rely on at all” were classified as “low reliance.”   Next, two- step cluster analysis was conducted to define groupings of users  based on reliance on SNSs and blogs, and to assess characteristics within and  among each user segment. Two- step cluster analysis allows segmenting of con- tinuous and categorical variables. Cases are assigned to clusters according to  Schwarz’s Bayesian Inference Criterion  BIC   Table 10.1 . Past research has    Between Barack and a Net Place    215  employed  cluster  analyses  to  segment  online  shoppers   Bhatnagar  &  Ghose,  2004  and cell phone users  Jih & Lee, 2003  by gratifications and demograph- ics, thus this method was appropriate for the current study.   Chi- square analysis was used for between cluster comparisons for the cate- gorical  variables   gender,  education,  political  party .  Frequencies  and  mean  scores  were  computed  for  within  cluster  analysis  of  demographics,  political  party affiliation, and political ideology. ANOVA was performed to ascertain  differences  among  the  clusters  for  the  continuous  variables   age,  income,  political ideology, political party ties, interest and knowledge of politics, inter- est and knowledge of the 2008 presidential election, trust in government, and  self- efficacy . Tukey’s HSD test for unequal sample sizes was applied to deter- mine which means were significantly different.   Lastly, mean scores were calculated for each of the 35 motivations for using  SNSs and blogs. Comparisons were made on two of the four clusters—Social  Networkers  those who heavily rely only on SNSs  and Blogophiles  those who  heavily rely only on blogs .  Results  The  main  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  examine  the  demographic  and  political  characteristics of those who use SNSs and blogs for political information. Addi- tionally, the motivations for using SNSs and blogs are compared.   The 4,241 respondents who completed the survey are predominately male   66.7% . The respondents are highly educated, have a yearly income of $92,500,  with  three- quarters   76.5%   having  completed  college  and  higher.  Almost  all   91.8%  are white and they average 46.4 years of age. The respondents closely   Table 10.1  Cluster model  Schwarz’s Bayesian Inference Criterion  BIC    Auto-clustering  Number of  clusters  Schwarz’s Bayesian  Criterion  BIC   BIC changea  Ratio of BIC  changesb  Ratio of distance  measuresc  1 2 3 4  6,934.520 2,042.880 315.558 66.731  –4,891.639 1,727.323 –248.826  1.000 0.353 0.051  2.814 6.569 d.  Notes a. The changes are from the previous number of clusters in the table. b. The ratios of changes are relative to the change for the two-cluster solution. c.  The  ratios  of  distance  measures  are  based  on  the  current  number  of  clusters   against the previous number of clusters.  d.  Since  the  distance  at  the  current  number  of  clusters  is  zero,  auto-clustering  will   not continue.   216    Convergent Practices  match the typical politically interested online user  well- educated, white, males   found in other studies  Pew Research Center, 2008a .   Ideologically,  four  in  ten   39.2%   of  the  respondents  assert  that  they  are  conservative very conservative, 38.7% liberal very liberal, and 22.9% mod- erate. Political party affiliation closely mirrors ideology, with 35.6% Republi- cans, 38.4% Democrats, and 18.1% Independents.   To get a clear look at those who use SNSs and those who use blogs, a two-  step cluster analysis categorized four groups of users. Cluster 1  Dabblers  is  made up of 1,308 respondents  31.1% of the overall sample  who do not rely  heavily on SNSs or blogs for political information. Cluster 2  Social Network- ers  contains 78 respondents  1.9%  who heavily access SNSs but not blogs.  Cluster 3  Ambi- textrous  consists of 120 respondents  2.9%  who heavily use  SNSs and blogs when seeking political information, and Cluster 4  Blogophiles   holds the majority of respondents  2,688, 64.1%  who heavily connect only to  blogs to find political information7  Table 10.2 . This study is primarily inter- ested in those who heavily use only SNSs  Social Networkers  and those who  heavily  use  only  blogs   Blogophiles   for  political  information,  and  therefore  the results are presented with a focus on these two groups.  Demographics and Political Characteristics  Within- cluster analysis shows that males make up a larger percentage  71.1%   of  Blogophiles   C4    those  who  heavily  use  blogs   than  any  other  cluster,  whereas  females  dominate  Cluster  2,  those  who  heavily  use  only  SNSs  for  political information  68.0% . Further, almost six of ten  57.7%  Social Net- workers  are  affiliated  with  the  Democratic  party,  whereas  Blogophiles  are  more  evenly  divided,  with  just  over  one- third   38.3%   belonging  to  the  Republican party and the slightly fewer  37.1%  to the Democratic party. A  look  at  political  ideology  shows  that  20.7%  of  Social  Networkers  consider  themselves conservative very conservative compared to 42.7% of Blogophiles.  Ambi- textrous  C3 , those who rely on SNSs and blogs, consists of the largest  percentage  64.2%  of liberals than any other cluster  Table 10.2 .   Between- cluster comparisons of frequencies on the categorical variables are  based on expected values. The findings show that Cluster 2, Social Networkers,  has the largest percentage of females than the other cluster   χ2 = 86.718, df = 3,  p < 0.000 , whereas a greater percentage of males are found in C4, those who  rely heavily only on blogs for political information. Further, Social Networkers  are  significantly  younger   m = 34.0  years   than  Blogophiles   m = 46.6  years    F[3,3895] = 35.368,  p < 0.000 .  Levels  of  education  do  not  significantly  vary  among the clusters, nor does income, even though Social Networkers report a  lower income  $38,500  than Blogophiles  $97,500   Table 10.3 .        .  % 1 4 6     s e  l i    s e s u   y l i v a e H  h p o g o B   4 C  l      8 8 6  2  = n  ,       .  % 9 2     s u o r t x e t - i b m A   3 C    s e s u   y l i v a e H      0 2  1  = n  l    s g o B   y l n o  l    s g o B   d n a   s S N S    y l i v a e H      8  7  = n      % 9 1    .    s S N S   y l n o   s e s u    s r e k r o w t e n   l a c o S   2 C  i    y l i v a e h   T O N   o D      8 0 3  1  = n  ,       .  % 1 1 3     s r e b b a D   1 C  l  l    s g o B   r o   s S N S   e s u  2 7 7 1      ,  .  % 1 1 7    9 1 7      .  % 9 8 2    6 5      % 2 2    .  ,  0 0 5 7 9 $  .  6 6 4  8 0 4 1      ,  .  % 6 6 5    4 2 0 1      ,  .  % 2 1 4    9 1 0 1      ,  .  % 3 8 3    7 8 9      .  % 1 7 3    0 5 4      .  % 9 6 1    5 0 2      % 7 7    .  1 3 0 1      ,  .  % 7 8 3    8 4 1 1      ,  .  % 7 2 4    5 9 4      .  % 6 8 1    5 9 2  .  3 6      .  % 8 5 5    0 5      .  % 2 4 4    ,  0 0 0 7 5 $  6      % 3 5    .  .  6 9 3  4 5      .  % 8 7 4    3 5      .  % 9 6 4    1 2      .  % 6 7 1    2 7      .  % 5 0 6    7 1      .  % 3 4 1    9      % 6 7    .  7 7      .  % 2 4 6    9 1      .  % 8 5 1    4 2      .  % 0 0 2    8 1 2  .  4 2      .  % 0 2 3    1 5      .  % 0 8 6    ,  0 0 5 8 3 $  1      % 3 1    .  .  0 4 3  8 4      .  % 0 4 6    6 2      .  % 7 4 3    5 1      .  % 2 9 1    5 4      .  % 7 7 5    2 1      .  % 4 5 1    6      % 7 7    .  4 2      .  % 2 4 4    7 2      .  % 1 5 3    6 1      .  % 7 0 2    8 6 2  .  0 5 7      .  % 0 1 6    9 7 4      .  % 0 9 3    1 2      % 7 1    .  ,  0 0 0 9 8 $  .  9 6 4  2 6 6      .  % 8 3 5    7 4 5      .  % 5 4 4    6 2 4      .  % 0 3 3    6 8 4      .  % 7 7 3    1 7 2      .  % 1 1 2    6 0 1      % 2 8    .  3 7 4      .  % 3 6 3    3 8 3      .  % 3 9 2    0 5 4      .  % 4 4 3    9 2  .  l  s r e t s u c   n h t i  i  i  l  w   e fi o r p   c h p a r g o m e D  .    2 0 1   e b a T  l  s s e l   r o   d a r g   l o o h c s   h g i H  e e r g e d   e g e  l l  o c   e m o S  e e r g e d   e t a u d a r G    n a e m      e m o c n  I    n a e m      e g A  e l a m e F  e l a M  y t r a p   l a c i t i l  o P  n a c  i l  b u p e R  t a r c o m e D  t n e d n e p e d n  I  r e h t O  r e t s u C  l  .  % 0 0 1   l a u q e   o t   y l l a c i t r e v   n u r   s e g a t n e c r e p   d n a   s r e b m u N  s e t o N    5     e v  i t a v r e s n o C   e v  i t a v r e s n o c   y r e V    5 – 1   e g n a r     n a e M    1     l a r e b L   l a r e b  i  i l   y r e V  l  y g o o e d i   l a c i t i l  o P  e t a r e d o M   l    s g o B   y l n o  l    s g o B   d n a   s S N S       .  % 1 4 6     s e  l i    s e s u   y l i v a e H  h p o g o B   4 C  l      8 8 6  2  = n  ,    s e s u   y l i v a e H      0 2  1  = n    y l i v a e H       .  % 9 2     s u o r t x e t - i b m A   3 C    s r e k r o w t e n   l a c o S   2 C  i      8  7  = n      % 9 1    .    s S N S   y l n o   s e s u  l    s g o B   r o   s S N S   e s u   y l i v a e h       .  % 1 1 3     s r e b b a D   1 C  l      T O N   o D      8 0 3  1  = n  ,  2 7 7 1      ,  .  % 1 1 7    9 1 7      .  % 4 5 5    ,  0 0 5 7 9 $  A 6 6 4  .  8 0 4 1      ,  .  % 8 4 6    4 2 0 1      ,  .  % 1 2 6    6 5      .  % 6 6 6    9 1 0 1      ,  .  % 8 8 6    7 8 9      .  % 1 2 6    0 5 4      .  % 0 0 6    5 0 2      .  % 9 2 6    1 3 0 1      ,  .  % 8 3 6    5 9 4      .  % 6 3 5    3 6      % 4 2    .  0 5      % 8 3    .  ,  0 0 0 7 5 $  B 6 9 3  .  4 5      % 5 2    .  3 5      % 2 3    .  6      % 1 7    .  1 2      % 4 1    .  2 7      % 5 4    .  7 1      % 3 2    .  9      % 8 2    .  7 7      % 8 4    .  9 1      % 1 2    .  4 2      % 9 0    .  1 5      % 9 3    .  ,  0 0 5 8 3 $  C 0 4 3  .  8 4      % 2 2    .  6 2      % 6 1    .  1      % 2 1    .  5 1      % 0 1    .  5 4      % 8 2    .  2 1      % 6 1    .  6      % 8 1    .  4 3      % 1 2    .  7 2      % 9 2    .  l  l  s r e t s u c   n e e w t e b   e fi o r p   c h p a r g o m e d   d n a   l a c  i  i t i l  .  o P   3 0 1   e b a T  l  0 5 7      .  % 7 8 2    9 7 4      .  % 9 6 3    ,  0 0 0 9 8 $  A 9 6 4  .  2 6 6      .  % 5 0 3    7 4 5     1 3 3    .  5 2      % 1 2    6 2 4      .  % 8 8 2    6 8 4      .  % 6 0 3    1 7 2      .  % 1 6 3    6 0 1      .  % 5 2 3    3 7 4      .  % 3 9 2    3 8 3      .  % 5 1 4    .  .    0 0 0  0  < p   , 8 6 3 5  3  = ] 5 9 8 3 3 [ F       n a e m  ,      e g A  .    0 0 0  0  < p   ,  .   3  = f d   , 8 1 7 6  8  = 2  χ     r e d n e G  r e t s u C  l  e l a m e F  e l a M  .  0 0 0  0  < p   ,  .   9  = f d   , 2 8 1 8  5  = 2  χ   y t r a p   l a c i t i l  o P  1   s s e l   r o   d a r g   l o o h c s   h g i H  e e r g e d   e g e  l l  o c   e m o S  e e r g e d   e t a u d a r G  .  .

A comparison of  mean scores indicates a significant difference in political ideology among the  clusters,  but  not  between  Social  Networkers  and  Blogophiles.

Further,  those who do not heavily rely on SNSs or blogs  Dabblers  report statistically  similar levels of political interest  m = 7.91  and knowledge  7.92  as Social  Networkers, whereas the Ambi- textrous, who heavily rely on both SNS and  blogs, are similar to Blogophiles  political interest m = 8.94, political know- ledge m = 8.49 . In general, all four clusters report moderate to high levels of  interest and knowledge in politics. Social  Networkers   C2   state  significantly  lower  levels  of  knowledge    about  the  2008  presidential  election   m = 8.31,  range  0–10   than  Blogophiles   C4    m = 8.94    F[3,4191] = 56.465,  p < 0.000 ;  however,  there was no difference between the two clusters in levels of interest in the  election. However, significant differences were found among the four clus- ters   F[3,4188] = 44.452,  p < 0.000 .  Dabblers,  those  who  do  not  heavily  rely  on  SNSs  or  blogs,  were  significantly  less  interested   m = 8.87   in  the  election  than  those  who  heavily  rely  on  both  resources   Ambi- textrous    m = 9.44 . Overall, respondents reported high levels in interest and know- ledge of the 2008 election.   When  examining  trust  and  self- efficacy,  the  findings  indicate  that  Social  Networkers are more trusting of the government  m = 8.87, range 3–15  than  Blogophiles   m = 7.99    F[3,4172] = 7.459,  p < 0.000 .  Ambi- textrous   rely  heavily on SNSs and blogs  express similar levels of trust  m = 8.87  as Social  Networkers,  whereas  Dabblers   do  not  heavily  rely  on  SNSs  or  blogs   are  closely aligned  m = 8.10  with Blogophiles. In general, all clusters report low  to moderate trust. Additionally, Social Networkers assert significantly lower  self- efficacy   m = 17.14    F[3,4191] = 56.465, p < 0.000 . In comparison, Social Networkers are more  trusting of the government but are lower in self- efficacy, whereas Blogophiles  are lower in trust but higher in self- efficacy.  than  Blogophiles   range  4–20     m = 15.65,    Between Barack and a Net Place    221    Regarding the strength of ties to a political party, Social Networkers and  Blogophiles  are  statistically  similar   m = 6.77,  m = 6.71,  respectively,  range  0–10 .  Differences  occur  among  Dabblers   C1   who  do  not  heavily  rely  on  SNSs or blogs and who report weaker ties to a political party  m = 6.18  than  the other clusters  F[3,4192] = 14.908, p < 0.000   Table 10.3 .   This study also investigates the top- 10 motivations for using SNSs and blogs  for  political  information.  Specifically,  comparisons  are  made  between  Social  Networkers who seek political information from SNSs, and Blogophiles who  turn to blogs. In all, 56 motivations were examined and the top- 10 reasons by  mean score were identified for each of the two clusters.   Four of the top- 10 motivations are common to each cluster: “because it’s  interesting,” “because I want to learn something new,” “to keep up with polit- ical issues,” and “to access political information at any time.” Politically inter- ested  users  are  motivated  to  use  SNSs  and  blogs  for  political  information,  convenience,  and  personal  fulfillment,  both  emotional  and  cognitive   Table  10.4 .   Apart  from  those  four  motivations,  clear  differences  in  the  reasons  for  using SNSs and blogs emerged. Social Networkers who mostly go to SNSs for  political  information  tend  to  do  so  mainly  for  social  reasons.  For  example,  this cluster that is made up primarily of younger females who are Democrats,  with  lower  levels  of  self- efficacy  but  higher  trust  than  Cluster  4,  and  who  report lower interest in and knowledge about politics and less knowledge of  the election, find SNSs “entertaining,” they “enjoy the excitement of the elec- tion race,” they gravitate to SNSs to “be in contact with like- minded people,”  “for the ongoing political debates,” and to “have something to talk about with  others.” On the other hand, Blogophiles  C4 , who tend to be older Republi- can  males,  are  drawn  to  blogs  for  political  information,  for  anti- traditional  media, and cognitive reasons. They access blogs for information not found in  traditional  media  and  because  blogs  are  independent  of  mainstream  media  sources.  They  also  turn  to  blogs  for  “links  to  more  political  sources,”  “for  political news analysis,” “for depth of political information,” and “to keep up  with  the  issues  of  the  day.”  None  of  the  top- 10  reasons  were  socially  oriented.   The  mean  scores  themselves  indicate  a  difference  in  the  strength  of  the  motivations  within  each  cluster.  Nine  of  the  ten  reasons  for  using  SNSs  for  political information were rated less strongly  range 1–5  than all of the moti- vations for using blogs. In other words, the strength of agreement for reasons  for  using  SNSs  ranges  from  a  high  of  4.38  to  a  low  of  3.79,  whereas  the  reasons  for  using  blogs  ranges  from  a  high  of  4.50  to  a  low  of  4.29.  These  mean  scores  indicate  that  the  reasons  for  seeking  political  information  are  more strongly associated with blogs than with SNSs  Table 10.4 .   222    Convergent Practices  Table 10.4   Top-10 motivations for heavily using political blogs and social networking   sites for political information  Social networking sites  C2.

Two- step cluster analysis identified four clusters of users: Cluster 1  Dabblers — those who do not heavily use SNSs or blogs for political information; Cluster 2   Social  Networkers —those  who  heavily  use  only  SNSs;  Cluster  3   Ambi-  textrous —those who heavily use SNSs and blogs; and Cluster 4  Blogophiles — those  who  heavily  use  only  blogs.  This  study  also  investigated  how  the  four  clusters of users differ in terms of demographic and political characteristics. The  primary comparisons are between Cluster 2  Social Networkers  and Cluster 4   Blogophiles  on demographic and political characteristics, and on their reasons  for using SNSs and blogs for political information. Focusing on these two groups  of users opens the potential for sharp differences among personal and political  characteristics and motivations to emerge.   Overall, this study found those who heavily rely on only SNSs  Social Net- workers   or  a  combination  of  SNSs  and  blogs   Ambi- textrous   tend  to  be  younger females, whereas those who rely heavily on only blogs  Blogophiles  or  rarely use blogs or SNSs  Dabblers  for political information tend to be older    Between Barack and a Net Place    223  males. These results may have emerged in part because females of low socio-  economic  status  were  more  likely  to  vote  for  Obama,  who  had  a  stronger  online presence than McCain  CNN.com, 2008 . These gender and age differ- ences are similar to those found in other studies  Johnson, Zhang, Bichard, &  Seltzer,  2010;  Lenhart,  2009;  Pew  Research  Center,  2008b;  Rainie,  2005;  Rainie & Horrigan, 2005; Salwen et al., 2005; Smith, 2009 , but they do not  account for all differences between blog and SNS users. Therefore this study  also examined the political characteristics of SNS and blog users.   In general, this study found that demographic, political, and motivational  differences among online users influence the online components they rely on  most  heavily   blogs  or  SNSs   for  political  information.  Analysis  of  political  party  affiliation  found  that  Social  Networkers  tend  to  belong  to  the  Demo- cratic party, whereas Blogophiles favor the Republican party. This finding is  not surprising given that Democrats are more likely to use and to have created  an  online  SNS  profile  than  Republicans   Smith  &  Ranie,  2008 .  From  these  party differences, it would be expected that liberals would be more likely to  inhabit Cluster 2 and conservatives Cluster 4, but that is not the case in this  study. Instead, there was no difference between these two clusters in whether  respondents were liberal, moderate, or conservative. The results on ideology  further confound the questions of whether liberals are more likely to use blogs   Pew Research Center, 2008b , or whether blogs are the domain of the right  wing   Johnson  et  al.,  2007;  Kaye  &  Johnson,  2004b ,  and  if  SNS  users  are  indeed more liberal  Johnson et al., 2010; Smith, 2009 .   It is curious that party affiliation is tied to SNS and blog use, but political  ideology  is  not,  especially  when  party  ties  tend  to  be  based  on  ideological  agreement. Perhaps in the case of this study when data were collected during  the height of the presidential campaign and subsequent election, respondents  were seeking political information mainly from party- and candidate- supported  SNSs and blogs, which generally follow more closely the mainstream perspec- tive of a party, leaving the ideologues  party fringe  to look elsewhere for like-  minded  information.  Also,  because  the  Obama  campaign  had  such  a  high  online profile and there was little voter crossover  10% Democrats voted for  McCain,  9%  Republicans  voted  for  Obama;  CNN.com,  2008 ,  online  users   especially  Democrats   may  have  connected  to  SNSs  and  blogs  as  a  show  of  party support, rather than out of ideological concerns.   Other  political  characteristics  also  distinguish  Social  Networkers  from  Blogophiles. Significant differences emerged in degree of trust in the govern- ment, self- efficacy, interest in and knowledge about politics, and knowledge  about the 2008 election. Blogophiles are less trusting of the government, more  self- efficacious,  more  interested  in  politics,  more  knowledgeable  about   politics,  and  more  interested  in  the  2008  presidential  election  than  Social    224    Convergent Practices  Networkers.  Presumably,  those  who  use  blogs  often  do  so  to  get  behind  a  cause  and  to  rally  support  for  a  blogger  or  issue,  thus  these  users  harbor  stronger confidence in their power to bring about political change than those  who rely only on SNSs. Additionally, the findings that levels of interest in and  knowledge  about  politics  and  the  election  are  higher  among  those  who  rely  heavily on blogs accords with other research that indicates that blogs are used  for more cognitive, informational reasons  Haigh & Pfau, 2007; Hebert, 2004;  Johnson & Kaye, 2006, 2007b, 2009; Johnson et al., 2007; Kaye, 2005, 2007,  2008;  Kaye  &  Johnson,  2006 ,  while  SNSs  are  used  for  more  emotional  or  social  purposes   boyd  &  Ellison,  2007;  Joinson,  2008;  Lampe  et  al.,  2006;  Raacke & Bonds- Raacke, 2008 .   There  are  several  demographic  and  political  overlaps  among  Social  Net- workers, Blogophiles, and Ambi- textrous. Similar to Social Networkers, the  Ambi- textrous  tend  to  be  females  who  belong  to  the  Democratic  party  and  trust  the  government.  The  Ambi- textrous  also  resemble  Blogophiles—both  groups report high levels of education, are self- efficacious, interested in pol- itics and in the 2008 election, and are knowledgeable about politics and the  election.  The  ambidextrous  see  value  in  both  SNSs  and  blogs.  As  blogs  and  social network sites evolve and are seen less as alternative sources and more as  mainstream  suppliers  of  news  and  political  information,  the  Ambi- textrous  may become the more typical Web 2.0 user.   This study also assessed the motivations for using SNSs and blogs for polit- ical  information,  and  compared  those  reasons  between  Social  Networkers   heavily use only SNSs  and Blogophiles  heavily use only blogs . The findings  indicate several key differences in the motivations for using SNSs and blogs.  SNSs are primarily used for political purposes but with a social spin, whereas  blogs are used for information and because users do not like or trust traditional  media.  For  example,  SNS  users  are  motivated  “to  be  in  contact  with  like-  minded people,” and “to give me something to talk about with others.” Blog  users, on the other hand, are motivated “for political news analysis,” and “for  information not found in traditional media.”   These  differences  in  motivations  between  Social  Networkers  and  Blogophiles supports previous studies which suggest that those who connect to  blogs  do  so  for  information  and  as  an  alternative  source  to  distrusted  main- stream  media   Johnson  &  Kaye,  2006,  2007b,  2009;  Johnson  et  al.,  2007;  Kaye,  2005,  2007,  2008;  Kaye  &  Johnson,  2006 .  Early  blogs  were  online  diaries that were used to keep in touch with family and friends, but they have  since evolved into multifaceted sites that are primarily used for information.  Instead of helping to form online social connections, perhaps blogs now foster  issue- oriented communities. The motivations found in this study also support  the  general  conclusion  that  users  are  drawn  to  SNSs  to  belong  to  social    Between Barack and a Net Place    225  communities and for social surveillance  boyd & Ellison, 2007; Joinson, 2008;  Lampe  et  al.,  2006;  Raacke  &  Bonds- Raacke,  2008 .  Although  users  seek  political information on SNSs, they may be looking for more personal political  information  i.e., who friends are voting for  rather than for general political  analysis. In general, this study indicates that users turn to blogs to obtain polit- ical information from the blogging community, whereas SNS users show party  support  and  form  political  social  circles.  As  unique  purposes  for  using  SNSs  and  blogs  emerge,  perhaps  they  will  each  attract  a  more  homogeneous,  but  more engaged, niche audience.   Although it is still too soon to know how SNSs will evolve, and how and  whether they will supplement or supplant other online sources, blogs are in  flux. They have since morphed into online venues for expression of any type,  be it thoughtful analysis or impulsive ranting, about any topic imaginable. But  the number of active blogs is fading. An estimated 95% lie dormant. As blog- gers tire of the burden of frequent updates and of responding to anonymous  others,  they  are  moving  on  to  SNSs  for  more  personal  interactions  of  their  choosing  Quenqua, 2009 .   As new Web 2.0 resources are created, they open new ways for users to be  both content providers and content receivers. Rather than holding to one or  two  older  and  favored  sources   e.g.,  listservs ,  online  users  are  expanding  their  repertoire  and  embracing  updated  and  new  technologies   e.g.,  blogs,  SNSs . In doing so, users are changing their online behaviors and are shifting  among sources that gratify their needs more readily. It will be interesting to  see if, by the 2012 presidential election, a larger percentage of users rely on  SNSs for political news and information, and if users of blogs and SNSs still  differ  on  key  political  characteristics.  It  would  also  be  interesting  to  find  whether  users  supplement  or  supplant  political  information  found  on  blogs  with that found on SNSs, and whether distinct motivations draw them to each  of the sources for political information.  Notes 1.  Although often called “Social  Networking Sites” this chapter uses the term “Social  Network Sites” as defined by boyd & Ellison  2007 , who assert that networking is  not the only reason for using such sites.  2.  SNSs and blogs are considered part of the second generation of online resources  collectively known by the term “Web 2.0,” which is defined as any online source  that involves consumer activity such as posting videos, writing blog content, and  networking  The State of the News Media, 2008 .  3.  The primary problem with online surveys is the absence of public central registries  from which to randomly select online users. Therefore, this study relied on a self-  selected convenience sample of users who were solicited by online announcements  to fill out the survey. Posting surveys online, however, is an efficient and low- cost    226    Convergent Practices  way  to  attract  respondents  and  the  method  has  become  fairly  common—most  market research these days is conducted using online convenience samples  Keeter,  2009 . Further, in situations where random probability sampling is not possible,  non- probability  sampling  is  acceptable   Babbie,  2002,  Web  Center  for  Social  Research  Methods,  2008;  Witte  et  al.,  2000 .  Although  researchers  must  be  mindful of the limitations of online purposive sampling, such samples can produce  results  that  may  be  representative  of  a  specific  subset  of  Internet  users  such  as  politically  interested  ones.  Additionally,  this  study  followed  procedures  used  in  other published studies  Johnson & Kaye, 2004, 2007a, 2009; Kaye, 2005, 2007 . 4.  The survey’s first question asked respondents to enter their email addresses; all but  17  99.1%  complied. The respondents’ email addresses, together with a computer- generated ID, were used to delete duplicated surveys. Additionally, after sending  the completed survey a Web page would immediately appear thanking the respond- ents for their participation and verifying that the survey had been sent so respond- ents would not retransmit the survey.  5.  Cooperation Rate: As defined by AAPOR “Standard Definitions”: “The proportion   of all cases interviewed of all eligible units ever contacted.”  6.  Survey  Variables:  reliance  on  blogs  and  social  networks  was  assessed  by  asking  respondents whether they “heavily rely,” “rely,” “sometimes rely,” “rarely rely,” or  “don’t rely” on political websites, blogs, bulletin boards lists, and chat instant mes- saging as sources of political information. Respondents were asked with which polit- ical party they were registered and how strongly they are affiliated with their party of  choice  0–10 scale, ranging from no party ties to very strong ties . They were also  asked  to  mark  their  political  ideology   very  liberal,  liberal,  neutral,  conservative,  very conservative . Respondents rated their levels of political knowledge, political  interest, and knowledge and interest in the 2008 political campaign on a 0–10 scale,  ranging from not at all interested to very interested. Lastly, they were asked to assess  their levels of trust in the government and self- efficacy.     This study also includes four demographic measures: gender, age, education, and  income. Respondents were asked to indicate whether they are male or female and  their age as of their last birthday. Respondents marked the highest grade completed  from  the  following  list:  “less  than  high  school,”  “high  school  graduate,”  “some  college,”  “four  year  college  degree,”  “master’s  degree,”  “Terminal  degree   PhD,  MD, JD, Ed.D ,” and “other,” and they estimated their 2008 income.     Motivations for using blogs and SNSs for political information were comprised of 35  statements derived from past uses and gratification studies  Johnson & Kaye, 2007b;  Kaye, 2007, 2008; Kaye & Johnson, 2004a, 2006 . Respondents were asked to mark  their level of agreement along with the reasons for accessing each of the four Internet  components. Responses ranged from  1  strongly disagree to  5  strongly agree.  7.  Totals: 4,194 respondents—47 did not fill out the reliance question.  References Babbie, E.  2002 .

Chapter 11 Working the Twittersphere Microblogging as Professional  Identity Construction  Dawn R. Gilpin  Public  relations  professionals  are  called  upon  to  forge  and  maintain  relation- ships with vast networks of stakeholders, colleagues, and contacts. These rela- tional networks are fluid, adjusting to constantly changing needs. The growth  of  online  communication  environments  has  been  seen  by  many  scholars  and  practitioners as an opportunity to extend the reach of public relations efforts to  a  larger  number  of  current  and  potential  organizational  stakeholders.  To  manage these networks of relationships, many practitioners have become active  users  of  social  media.  One  outlet  that  is  rapidly  growing  in  popularity  is  Twitter: a Web 2.0 service that allows users to perform “micro- blogging,” or  communicate in messages of no more than 140 characters  known as “tweets” .   This chapter approaches Twitter as a window into the complex processes of  professional  identity  construction  employed  by  public  relations  practitioners  today. Analyzing some of the most prominent Twitter feeds among the online  professional  public  relations  community  in  the  United  States,  the  study  described here used social and semantic network analysis to examine use of the  microblogging site among public relations practitioners. Findings indicate that  Twitter  serves  multiple  purposes  for  practitioners,  such  as  information  sharing, networking, and establishing professional expertise. Finally, Twitter  itself  emerges  as  a  boundary- blurring  tool  that  links  multiple  online  spheres  and spans the divide between offline and virtual professional domains. Twitter  illustrates  the  ways  in  which  social  media  are  encouraging  patterns  of  self-  organization among public relations practitioners seeking new ways to adapt to  a turbulent professional environment.  Literature Review  The  use  of  Twitter  by  public  relations  professionals  can  be  situated  within  a  context  of  extant  research  on  identity  construction,  co- creational  processes  in  public relations practice, and the rise of “reality” media across multiple platforms.   Working the Twittersphere    233  Constructing a Professional Identity  Identity construction can be seen as the sense- making process by which people  selectively  organize  their  experiences  into  a  coherent  sense  of  self   Fisher,  1987;  Giddens,  1991;  Ricoeur,  1985;  Somers,  1994 .  Recent  literature  on  identity shifts attention away from subject attributes to dialogic processes of  negotiation  and  performance  constructed  through  interaction  over  time   Somers,  1994;  Wiley,  1994 .  Polillo   2004   expands  on  Wiley’s   1994   concept of the “semiotic self ” by incorporating contemporary understanding of  social networks. In this view, identity is constructed as the result of structural  and power dynamics, and subject to constant negotiation of boundaries.   Online  interactive  media  further  complicate  the  question  of  boundaries.  Giddens  1991  reflected at length on the role of mediated experience in con- structing identity and organizing social relationships disembedded from space  and time. Several scholars have remarked in particular on the blurring between  professional  and  personal  identities  in  electronically  mediated  environments   Andrejevic,  2004;  Lüders,  2008;  Papacharissi,  2009 .  Online  interactions  take place in a space that is neither distinctly professional nor distinctly per- sonal. Lüders  2008  noted that the relative personal or professional nature of  digital media can only be determined through a case- by-case review of both  structure  and  content.  A  television  program  may  allow  viewer  call- ins,  but  still takes place in an institutionalized context, whereas a blog may be created  and maintained by an individual, but emphasize professional content. Unless  users adopt multiple online profiles, social networking sites represent a conflu- ence of identity roles, spaces where users “must adjust their behavior so as to  make it appropriate for a variety of different situations and audiences”  Papa- charissi,  2009,  p.  207 .  The  message  is  now  as  important,  or  even  more  important, than the medium, and yet it is constrained by the multiplicity of  contexts in which it will be received.   Public  professional  identities  are  constructed  through  a  combination  of  social ties and relational content. This process can be facilitated through social  networking sites which, as Papacharissi  2009  observed, “operate on enabling  self- presentation and connection- building”  p. 201 . The role of social ties has  been explored by numerous scholars. Connections to other users on such sites  have been described as “public displays of connection”  boyd & Heer, 2006,  p.  73   that  add  value  and  validity  to  an  individual’s  identity  performance.  Unlike  other  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook  or  MySpace,  the  primary site for this performance on Twitter is not the individual’s own profile  space, however loosely bounded. Twitter leaves little room for visual cues or  sidebars of taste  Papacharissi, 2009 . Twitter user profiles are very short, and  provide minimal information about the account holder. While the profiles do    234    Convergent Practices  list  both  the  users  followed  and  the  account  holder’s  own  followers,  many  users participate via third- party applications rather than the Twitter.com page  itself,  bypassing  profiles  altogether  and  operating  almost  exclusively  in  the  common space of social exchange.   Twitter’s emphasis on public interaction makes active interlocutors a more  significant indicator of social capital than follower counts. This is also the case  since public Twitter profiles allow any user to follow any other, without the  “walled  garden”  effect  of  relatively  enclosed  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook. A so- called “at- reply” or “mention,” a directed message prefaced by  the @ symbol and an individual’s user name, is instead a marker of a stronger  tie between users. Interaction thus plays an especially strong role in identity  construction in a conversational medium such as Twitter, as followers will pri- marily draw conclusions based on the contents of tweet messages as well as  indications of the intended recipients of those messages  see also Papacharissi,  2009 .   Most  research  on  constructing  professional  identity  has  focused  on  indi- viduals. For example, in a study of Russian public relations practitioners, Tset- sura  2007  described the importance of exploring processes of constructing  and negotiating professional identities as twofold: helping to distinguish pro- fessional  roles  and  understand  the  individual  communication  strategies  employed. However, she also noted that “such identity negotiations influence  the way public relations is practiced”  p. 2 . Thus, constructing a professional  identity  also  means  constructing  the  identity  of  the  profession,  especially  a  profession in a state of flux such as contemporary public relations.  Co- Creational Public Relations and Social Media  in the Professional World  Recent trends in public relations scholarship and practice have distanced the  field  from  one- way  publicity  and  press  agentry  models   Grunig,  1989   to  emphasis on the relationship- building function of public relations  Ledingham  &  Bruning,  2000 .  This  shift  away  from  an  organization- centric  perspective  also leads to conceptualizing issues and publics as dynamic, contextually situ- ated, co- creational processes rather than objectively defined entities  Botan &  Taylor, 2004; Curtin & Gaither, 2006 . An issue, in this case, is defined as any  publicly discussed matter that may constitute either a threat or an opportunity  from the perspective of those discussing it  Bridges & Nelson, 2000; Heath,  1997 . Publics are groups of stakeholders that emerge and coalesce based on  their objective or subjective interest in a given issue  Botan & Taylor, 2004 .   The  emergence  of  new  and  social  media  may  be  viewed  as  an  issue  for  public relations practitioners, since they require adaptation to new tools and    Working the Twittersphere    235  challenge practices that previously relied on traditional mass media. A recent  survey  of  practitioners  found  that  blogs  had  become  part  of  the  accepted  toolbox  used by nearly 42% of those surveyed , whereas social networking  sites such as Facebook and MySpace, social bookmarking, and microblogging  were  far  less  commonly  adopted   Eyrich,  Padman,  &  Sweetser,  2008 .  The  same study found that practitioners’ personal adoption of tools correlated to a  significant  degree  to  their  perception  of  industry- wide  adoption.  In  other  words, practitioners are more likely to use a tool if they see it as an important  part of professional practice. Thus, the more the profession is seen to rely on  social media, the more its members will turn to these tools for their own com- munication purposes. Early adopters therefore have the opportunity to signifi- cantly influence the identity of the profession and the shape of future practice  through their use of new forms of communication and the way they construct  the role of these tools in public relations work.   The constitution of social media as an issue among public relations practi- tioners also ties into Giddens’  1991  observation of the role of expert know- ledge in modern abstract systems, and in the construction of what he termed  “self- identity,” or “the self as reflexively understood by the person”  p. 53  and  based on the ability to maintain some sort of coherent self- narrative over time.  The  modern  emphasis  on  constant  self- improvement  and  development  of  ever- more specialized and narrow forms of expertise creates pockets of know- ledge that become disembedded from other spheres of activity, and may lead  to  unintended  consequences.  If  practitioners  who  establish  their  identity  on  the basis of expertise in these new forms of digital communication become too  insular, then, they are likely to lose sight of the potential ramifications of their  activities on the profession and on their client organizations. This risk may be  exacerbated by the tendency to view socially mediated relations as more trans- parent  than  those  of  traditional  media,  given  the  erosion  of  boundaries  and  pressure to offer one’s work up to public surveillance  Holtz & Havens, 2008 .  This pressure emerges from the larger trend toward mediated reality.  The Reality of New Media and Mediated Reality  In  today’s  communication  environment,  and  in  particular  the  professional  realm,  there  is  “a  premium  on  the  ability  to  see  through  public  façades  by  relying  on  strategies  of  detection  and  verification  facilitated  by  interactive  communication  technologies  that  allow  users  to  monitor  one  another”   Andrejevic, 2006, p. 391 . Active users of public discussion technologies vol- untarily expose themselves to observation by peers, clients, potential clients,  and others. Media scholars who have studied reality television programming  have noted how the medium emphasizes the sharing of mundane life events,    236    Convergent Practices  information,  and  advice   Ouellette  &  Hay,  2008 .  This  content  is  geared  toward an entrepreneurial ethos of self- directed information- seeking and the  need for “highly dispersed and practical techniques for reflecting on, manag- ing,  and  improving  the  multiple  dimensions  of  our  personal  lives  with  the  resources available to us”  Ouellette & Hay, 2008, p. 2 .   The  Internet  is  another  domain  that  offers  such  a  range  of  techniques,  particularly the rise of social media and personal publishing. Like television,  the Internet can be described as a cultural technology that serves to inform and  influence  people  while  sitting  at  an  intersection  of  regulatory,  cultural,  and  economic interests  Bennett, 1995; Ouellette & Hay, 2008 . Bennett  1995   described the “new logic” of cultural technologies as “a set of exercises through  which those exposed to its influence were to be transformed into the active  bearers and practitioners of the capacity for self- improvement that culture was  held to embody”  p. 24 . In this vein, Twitter has been cited as the emerging  marketplace for “the new gurus”  Rolling Stone, 2009 , a place where readers  can find and share information  Palser, 2009 , and even a tool for empowering  citizens  to  organize  large- scale  protests  and  enact  social  change   Grossman,  2009 . Twitter can thus be seen, alongside other social networking sites and  online communication tools, as part of the new reality media landscape.   Similar trends extend beyond the personal realm to the professional. The  progressive blurring of lines between entertainment and labor was observed  by  Andrejevic   2004 ,  who  noted  that  the  Internet  offers  unprecedented  opportunities for the atomization and surveillance of work- related activities.  Ouellette and Hay  2008  pointed out that, in reality television programming,  “[t]he assumption that we must all maximize our greatest asset—ourselves— has accelerated”  p. 7  as world economies and job markets become increas- ingly  turbulent  and  uncertain.  Reputation  is  a  central  concept  of  public  relations  see Carroll & McCombs, 2003; Williams & Moffitt, 1997 . Current  definitions  of  reputation  hinge  on  its  dynamic,  co- constructed  nature  as  a  process  dependent  on  both  direct  and  symbolic  experiences  between  indi- viduals  or  between  individuals  and  organizations   Gioia,  Schultz,  &  Corley,  2000; Gotsi & Wilson, 2001 . Public relations professionals seek to develop  positive associations on behalf of client organizations through both direct and  indirect communication, and organizations are urged to use social networking  to  help  improve  their  reputation  with  key  stakeholders   Maddock  &  Vitn,  2008 .   Online  tools  such  as  Twitter  are  therefore  a  logical  extension  of  existing  and emerging public relations practices, a site where professionals can engage  in reputation management for themselves while gaining skills that will serve  them in their capacity as consultants. These practices effectively expand pro- fessional  public  relations  activities  to  include  public  relating,  in  which    Working the Twittersphere    237  professionals conduct interactions under open surveillance. In doing so, it is  argued here, they construct their own public and professional identity, con- tribute to shaping the identity of public relations as a whole, and perform in a  new media reality context. The purpose of this study is to take a first step in  examining some of the processes by which these identities and performances  take place, and suggest avenues of future research.  Data and Methods Used  Data for this study were gathered starting with a core of three subjects, identi- fied  using  the  blog  search  engine  at  technorati.org.  Technorati  calculates  an  “authority index” intended to reflect the number of linkages between each blog  and  others,  as  an  approximation  of  social  capital.  The  focal  subjects  for  this  study  were  selected  by  identifying  the  three  most  authoritative  blogs  tagged   by their authors  as concerning the topic of “public relations,” written by indi- vidual practitioners and with links to a Twitter account from the blog itself.  Using  the  Twitter  search  function  at  search.twitter.com   then  a  separate  service,  but  later  incorporated  into  the  Twitter  homepage ,  a  search  con- ducted on each focal subject’s moniker produced all messages, or tweets, sent  and received by that person. These tweets were saved for a four- week period,  from  April  4  through  May  1,  2008,  to  provide  sufficient  data  for  analysis.  Another  advantage  of  the  period  chosen  was  that  both  the  Society  for  New  Communication Research  SCNR  Forum and the Web 2.0 Expo were held  during the third week, April 22–25, and provided the opportunity to observe  any changes in network dynamics based on offline interactions among the indi- viduals observed. Table 11.1 provides a summary of the data gathered.   Around  17%  of  the  tweets  contained  links,  which  are  a  primary  form  of  information and resource sharing among Twitter users. Undirected tweets are  those  without  an  @  symbol,  a  Twitter  convention  signifying  that  a  tweet  is  addressed to or contains a mention of another Twitter user. Undirected tweets  are  intended  for  the  public  at  large,  and  often  respond  to  the  Twitter.com  question, “What are you doing?” Directed tweets are those containing the @  symbol, and are indicative of interaction between Twitter users. These tweets  therefore form the basis of the network analyses.  Table 11.1  Summary of data gathered  Total tweets logged  Links Undirected Directed  1,854    316   427 1,427   238    Convergent Practices  Social and Semantic Network Analysis  Communication  networks  have  been  defined  as  “patterns  of  contact  that  are  created by the flow of . . . data, information, knowledge, images, symbols, and  any other symbolic forms that can move from one point in a network to another  or can be cocreated by network members”  Monge & Contractor, 2003, p. 5 .  Interactions conducted via social networking tools such as Twitter represent an  accessible terrain for analysis of both the structure of communication networks  and the symbolic forms, or language, used by network members.   As mentioned already, identity is publicly constructed through a combina- tion  of  associative  patterns  and  communication  content.  This  study  therefore  used  two  forms  of  network  analysis,  or  the  study  of  linkage  patterns  among  actors or other elements—including lexical units—in an identified group  Bor- gatti & Foster, 2003; Carley & Kaufer, 1993; Kadushin, 2004; Kilduff & Tsai,  2003 , to examine both dimensions of this process. Social network analysis pro- duces  a  map  of  connections  between  the  Twitter  users  examined  here,  to  identify groupings and form a starting point for theorizing about basic power  dynamics. The study design, which focused on three central users and recorded  their interactions with others, does not offer a complete picture of all relation- ships within the network: the focal subjects will emerge as the most important  figures in the network, simply because interactions that did not involve them  were excluded from the study. It is therefore impossible to draw firm conclu- sions about the position of each within the public relations “Twittersphere” as a  whole.  However,  the  interaction  patterns  that  emerge  from  this  study  can  provide clues about more general trends and suggest lines of future inquiry.   Social network analysis can identify the key players in a given domain, the  relationships among them, and patterns of change. The main software package  used to conduct these analyses was Pajek  de Nooy, Mrvar, & Batagelj, 2005 ,  which  offers  a  number  of  advanced  computational  functions  that  can  help  identify  structural  patterns  in  data.  In  this  case,  Pajek  was  used  to  identify  aggregate social formations among the users studied.   Groups develop their own habits, customs, and even linguistic references.  The term “idioculture” refers to “a system of knowledge, beliefs, behaviors and  customs  shared  by  members  of  an  interacting  group”   Gunawardena  et  al.,  2009 .  Idioculture  can  also  be  studied  as  a  network  property:  semantic  network  analysis  uses  network  theories  and  methods  to  identify  patterns  in  language, and was employed in this study to give a sense of the overall idiocul- ture  of  the  group  identified.  The  tweet  texts  were  analyzed  using  a  process  known  as  centering  resonance  analysis   CRA ,  which  relies  on  theories  of  language  processing  and  network  measures  to  identify  the  most  influential  nouns and noun phrases within a text or set of texts  Corman, Kuhn, McPhee,    Working the Twittersphere    239  & Dooley, 2002 . Crawdad software  Corman & Dooley, 2006  was used for  this  purpose.  Crawdad  does  not  simply  count  word  frequency,  but  can  also  calculate ties between non- adjacent words to reveal more fully developed con- cepts.  This  is  done  using  the  network  concept  of  betweenness  centrality,  which measures how many ties within the text must pass through a given term   Corman et al., 2002 . The software does not require the researcher to input  prepared dictionaries or prepare drop lists of potentially confounding words  such as definite and indefinite articles. This approach thus reduces the risk of  instrumental or researcher bias compared to some forms of content analysis.  At the same time, the resulting data provide only a starting point for analysis,  and  the  researcher  must  interpret  the  output  based  on  context.  Since  CRA  only  focuses  on  noun  phrases,  it  is  best  suited  for  exploratory  analysis  to  identify general topics and themes within a text or set of texts.  Findings and Analysis  Although the relational patterns and semantic content of the tweet texts are  closely  intertwined,  this  section  will  describe  the  findings  for  each  type  of  analysis carried out. The discussion in the following section will then contex- tualize  and  explore  the  significance  of  the  combined  semantic  and  social  network analyses.  Social Network Analysis  The social network analysis revealed a two- tiered pattern of interaction: a core  group of users who exchanged at least 20 tweets with the central figures in the  space of a week, and a slightly larger group with whom the latter exchanged at  least 10 tweets. These tiers represent levels of relational interaction within a  subnetwork,  a  group  of  people  whose  members  communicate  with  one  another via Twitter on a relatively regular basis. Table 11.2 shows the nodes  and ties for each week as well as the aggregate figures.  Table 11.2  Weekly colloquy composition  Total   nodes  Total core  nodes  Total core   ties  %   Total extended  nodes  Total ties  Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Aggregate  27 35 40 45 51  3 + 9 3 + 11 3 + 12 3 + 14 3 + 15  236  54  268  51  306  54  316  50  334  48   15 21 25 28 33  435 521 569 629 691   240    Convergent Practices    Figure 11.1 shows the network diagram for the aggregate subnetwork. As  indicated in Table 11.2, this subnetwork consisted of 51 individuals: the three  central figures, and those belonging to the two highest tiers of interaction. The  size of the nodes in Figure 11.1 represents their degree, or the total number of  tweets  exchanged.  Arrows  represent  the  existence  and  direction  of  tweets  exchanged between users. Thus the three largest nodes are the three central  practitioners;  the  black  nodes  represent  the  core  group  with  whom  at  least  one  user  exchanged  20  or  more  tweets  in  at  least  one  week  of  the  period  examined;  and  the  smaller,  white  nodes  are  the  second  tier  of  interaction,  with at least 10 messages exchanged in a week.   Table 11.3 shows the total number of interlocutors and directed messages  for each central subject, week by week. User M1 was far more densely con- nected to start with, interacting with 88 other users the first week compared  to 58 for M2 and just 37 for F1. He exchanged a total of 188 directed mes- sages with those interlocutors. All three of the focal users increased their total  number of contacts during the period studied, but the patterns of growth dif- fered  markedly:  users  F1  and  M2  showed  large  spikes  in  both  contacts  and  messages during weeks 3 and 4, coinciding with the two major social media  events  held  that  week  and  attended  by  both.  User  M1,  on  the  other  hand,  interacted with just over half the number of contacts in week 3 as in week 4   67 compared to 119 . The number of directed messages, however, did not  drop to the same degree: M1 exchanged 212 directed tweets in week 3, down  from  265  in  week  2.  By  week  4  he  returned  to  similar  levels  as  week  2,  exchanging  264  directed  tweets  with  111  users   compared  to  265  and  119,  respectively, in week 2 .

As a highly visible figure in the social media commun- ity among public relations and marketing practitioners, he continued to receive a  relatively large number of directed tweets  203, compared to 156 for the first  two weeks , but sent more undirected tweets during this period  176, compared  to 85 for the first two weeks . At the same time, being already well embedded in  these  communities,  the  events  did  not  apparently  serve  the  same  function  of  expanding his circle of professional contacts as it did for the other two focal users.   These patterns suggest that practitioners use Twitter for a variety of purposes  at  offline  events:  to  expand  and  reinforce  professional  contacts;  to  serve  as  a  “broadcasting voice” reporting events as they occur, and expressing opinions on  them; and to construct or cement an identity of membership in the social media  community.  Semantic Network Analysis  The semantic network analysis revealed a total of 31 individual words with a  betweenness centrality  a measure of influence, see Corman et al., 2002  of  0.013 or greater, and 31 word pairs with a betweenness centrality of 0.01 or  greater.  Since  network  measures  take  place  within  a  specific  circumscribed  domain, there is no universal threshold of significance; values must be assessed  relative to others within the same context. Table 11.4 lists these words and  word pairs along with their relative centrality values for comparison.   242    Convergent Practices  Table 11.4  Influential words and word pairs  Word  Betweenness centrality Word pair  Betweenness centrality  Twitter good great time new blog thanks post today day PR social media people nice thing client retweet way session social big week SNCR bad SEO same media guy cool interesting tool  0.14226 0.12376 0.08464 0.06365 0.06142 0.06011 0.05973 0.05128 0.04071 0.037378 0.03213 0.03189 0.03052 0.02817 0.02409 0.02352 0.2216 0.02214 0.02165 0.01863 0.01841 0.01746 0.01735 0.0158 0.1526 0.0151 0.0147 0.01424 0.01407 0.01375 0.01343  0.053 Twitter – good 0.048 Twitter – great 0.047 good – time 0.036 Twitter – time 0.035 Twitter – new 0.034 Twitter – blog 0.030 great – post 0.029 Twitter – post 0.025 Twitter – thanks 0.024 good – thing 0.019 good – post 0.019 good – people 0.019 new – post 0.018 Twitter – PR 0.016 Twitter – nice 0.016 great – time 0.015 good – new 0.015 good – blog 0.015 good – thanks 0.015 good – today 0.015 new – thanks 0.014 Twitter – thing 0.013 Twitter – people 0.012 Twitter – today 0.012 good – PR 0.012 good – social media 0.012 blog – post 0.010 good – great 0.010 great – blog new – social media 0.010 Twitter – social media 0.010    Several surface trends are evident from these data. The most immediately  evident is that Twitter and other digital media tools and concepts constituted a  primary topic of discussion within the group. “Twitter” itself is the most influ- ential single word in the aggregate text, with “social media”  treated as a single  term  also ranked highly. “SEO”  the common abbreviation for “search engine  optimization,” or the design of online content to permit effective indexing by  search engine crawlers and, therefore, visibility to users seeking information  about  a  given  topic   appears  relatively  low  but  still  influential.  This  ranking  suggests that practitioners active in online environments such as Twitter are  attentive to the role of SEO in the dissemination of messages and reach meas- urement, and is another indicator of conscious attention to reputation.   Working the Twittersphere    243    Second, Twitter was often used to express positive opinions, particularly about  these tools, or to recommend and discuss specific instances of good practice by  others  “Twitter great” and “Twitter good” were the two most influential word  pairs; other examples include “great post,” “great blog,” “good social media,” and  “good PR” . “Good,” “great,” “nice,” “cool,” and “interesting” all appeared among  the most influential words, with a single negative term “bad” appearing toward  the bottom of the influence rankings. Since the centering resonance analysis tech- nique used to examine the tweets only identifies noun phrases, it does not per- fectly capture aspects such as tone and valence: for instance, the term “good” may  appear as a question  “Is this an example of good practice?”  or even in the negat- ive   “This  is  not  a  good  tool  to  use  with  clients” .  Neither  instance  would  be  reflected in the analysis, and requires qualitative study. That said, the high preva- lence of terms such as “good” and “great” indicate a generally positive tone of most  discussions in the data set—praising colleagues, social media tools, articles, and  blog  posts  about  professional  topics,  and  so  on.  This  pattern  makes  sense  if  Twitter is seen as, at least in part, an instrument for disseminating links, informa- tion, or reflections one believes will be useful to fellow professionals.   Finally,  the  profession  itself  was  also  a  common  topic  of  discussion  among  those studied: “PR” was in the top one- third of individual terms, and appeared in  conjunction with both “Twitter” and “good” in the list of influential word pairs.  “Media” and “tool” suggest further discussion of public relations practice. Although  the content of links shared is not accessible through the semantic analysis of the  tweets, the numerous references to blog posts in this context implies pointers to  more  in- depth  discussion  of  professional  topics  outside  the  restrictive  Twitter  milieu. Word pairs such as “Twitter–new” and “new–social media” also indicate  discussions  about  the  expanding  boundaries  of  public  relations  practice  as  the  media environment evolves to include new communication channels.  Discussion  Although  the  analyses  provide  some  interesting  findings  when  viewed  sepa- rately, combining semantic and social network data depicts patterns of inter- action more comprehensively. The aggregate analysis conducted here does not  allow for fine- grained review of individual identity construction strategies, but  the  wide  lens  does  allow  a  useful  perspective  from  which  to  contextualize  future research in this area.  Colloquys: Knowledge Communities of Parallel  Experience  The people with whom we associate help to shape and reinforce our identity,  and network scholars have noted that people tend to aggregate based on shared    244    Convergent Practices  characteristics  homophily , and can mutually influence one another in areas such  as innovation adoption if they hold similar positions, even if they are not directly  linked   structural  equivalence    see  Burt,  1982;  McPherson,  Smith- Lovin,  &  Cook, 2001 . Connections forged directly at offline social media events or via  Twitter can therefore influence the professional choices and behaviors even of  those  who  do  not  directly  participate  in  these  activities.  The  social  groupings  observed in the data are therefore worthy of careful examination.   Describing groups based on shared attributes can pose particular conceptual  and methodological challenges in online media, since not all users can be iden- tified by gender, age, professional affiliation, education, socioeconomic status,  or  other  typical  markers.  If  we  view  social  networking  as  “the  practice  of  expanding knowledge by making connections with individuals of similar inter- ests”  Gunawardena et al., 2009, p. 3 , then we need to examine the group- ings  constituted  by  those  connections  as  phenomena  unto  themselves,  quite  separate from any specific attributes shared by individual members.   Numerous types of emergent professional groups are described in organiza- tional  literature.  Communities  of  practice  are  social  networks  that  may  combine  online  or  offline  means  of  communication  and  collaboration   Cox,  2008; Wenger, 1998; Wenger, McDermott, & Snyder, 2002 . Communities  of practice typically share a common purpose and have a sense of their group  as directed toward a specific work goal, to be achieved by sharing resources  and deepening knowledge through ongoing interaction  Wenger et al., 2002 .  A dispersed group formed in an informal setting rarely has a directed focus,  however. Cox  2008  described occupational communities as assemblages of  individuals who share the same occupational role, hold similar values, observe  common  norms,  and  frequently  overlap  with  personal  relationships.  While  some or all of these features may apply to the core grouping identified in this  study, there is no way to accurately verify them.   The  stronger  the  social  ties,  the  more  likely  a  group  is  to  see  itself  as  a  bounded entity, creating an in- group out- group dynamic that may also affect  the  sharing  of  information  and  resources  among  members   McGraw  &  Tetlock, 2005 . However, if these distinctions are too blurry to be meaningful  identifiers of group membership, then individuals may be less inclined to parti- cipate  in  electronic  word- of-mouth  sharing,  as  they  “may  become  relatively  more  sensitive  to  the  personal  gains losses  from  giving  information,  which  would  make  them  pay  more  attention  to  the  traits value  of  information”   Sohn, 2009, p. 355 . This tendency suggests that information shared in fluid,  public, online venues such as Twitter is frequently the result of a more or less  conscious  decision  to  share  only  that  information  which  brings  the  greatest  gain, in terms of social capital or professional reputation, at the least cost to  the individual.   Working the Twittersphere    245    The data used in this study were gathered in early 2008, approximately one  year after the service was first launched  http:  twitter.com about . The users  tracked  were  therefore  fairly  early  adopters  of  this  new  technology.  Cox   2008  suggested that “parallel experiences of work”  p. 329  can produce a  sense of community among people with otherwise loose ties. The experience  of being an active user of this new social networking site may be considered a  form of parallel experience in and of itself. Combined with the parallel work  experience shared by public relations professionals by virtue of their practice,  the ties formed in an atmosphere of community that fostered a desire to share  knowledge, information, and experiences.   The central grouping that emerged from the data may therefore be viewed  as  a  form  of  colloquy,  an  ongoing  discussion  of  interested  professionals  who  congregate to discuss specific topics of interest and collectively negotiate defi- nitions, applications, norms, and professional identities. The existence of tiers  beyond the colloquy suggest that public relations professionals on Twitter find  core homophilous groups for ongoing conversation, while taking advantage of  the extended reach provided by a channel such as Twitter to seek information  and a wider range of perspectives on topics of interest. The aggregate semantic  network  analysis  indicates  that  professionals  who  closely  associate  with  each  other  in  this  context  share  central  concerns.  These  central  concerns  largely  focus on the role of Twitter itself in professional public relations practice.  Professional Twittering: Working On Being  Watched  Situating the findings in the theoretical frameworks of the new reality media,  modernity, and co- creational public relations, the social and semantic network  data suggest the following patterns of professional identity construction among  the individuals studied.  Social Media as a Significant Professional Issue  The prevalence of discussion about Twitter—and, more generally, the broader  area of social media—over the four- week period constitutes these topics as an  issue  according  to  the  co- creational  approach  favored  by  recent  scholarship   Botan  &  Taylor,  2004 .  The  emergence  of  a  core  colloquy  also  constitutes  participants as a key public in relation to this issue; in particular, since the focal  subjects are public relations professionals, at least some of the participants rep- resent  a  burgeoning  cluster  of  opinion  leaders  on  the  subject.  At  the  same  time, one’s own habits can influence perceptions: researchers have found that  “more  advanced  users  of  social  media  . . .  have  a  greater  feeling  that  social    246    Convergent Practices  media  has  been  integrated  widely  into  the  industry”   Eyrich  et  al.,  2008,  p. 414  than those who use only more common digital forms of communica- tion such as blogs and Intranets. There is thus the risk of active online practi- tioners inaccurately generalizing their experience to the profession as a whole,  and  exaggerating  the  importance  of  social  media  or  specific  tools  in  public  relations activities. These factors, along with social network scholarship on the  effects of social equivalence  Burt, 1982 , suggest that these conversations can  influence  the  direction  and  identity  of  the  public  relations  profession  as  a  whole, even beyond the confines of Twitter and other social networking sites.  Professional Embeddedness  Although  this  study  examines  Twitter  participation  in  isolation  from  other  forms  of  social  media  such  as  blogging,  Facebook,  discussion  forums,  or  others,  the  prevalence  of  retweeting,  links,  and  mentions  of  terms  such  as  “blog  post”  confirm  that  Twitter  users  typically  partake  of  a  broad  menu  of  social media offerings. Activity on Twitter can be seen as a means of increasing  one’s professional visibility, as well as driving traffic to one’s presence in other  online  venues.  Public  interaction  with  others,  including  posts  about  offline  professional events and social interaction with other practitioners, contributes  to building an identity as an entrenched professional.  Public Relations as Publicly Relating  In keeping with the profession’s emphasis on building relationships rather than  relying on media reports for publicity and image enhancement, the public rela- tions practitioners at the core of this study publicly engaged in the practice of  using  social  media  tools  to  construct  professional  relationships.  In  this  way,  they  move  the  profession  as  a  whole  further  in  the  relational  direction,  and  take the opportunity to publicly experiment with new media tools for profes- sional  purposes.  These  skills  and  connections  can  then  be  used  on  behalf  of  client organizations.  Performing the Professional Self  As noted in the analysis, there was a high prevalence of positive terms in the  tweets, particularly in relation to Twitter itself and social media practices in  general, as well as praising the comments and actions of other users. It seems  likely that negative opinions are typically expressed elsewhere, either offline  or  in  formats  such  as  blog  posts,  which  allow  more  nuanced  exposition  of  opinions  and  may  appear  less  confrontational.  It  is  not  surprising  that    Working the Twittersphere    247  communication professionals should show such awareness of the potential pit- falls inherent in various communication channels, but it does highlight the per- formative  nature  of  professional  conversations  that  take  place  in  public  channels such as Twitter. This is not to say that the opinions expressed are not  sincere, only that one must be cautious in accepting social media conversations  as wholly representative of a person’s or group’s opinions. Furthermore, these  positive expressions reinforce group membership in the colloquy or may indi- cate a desire to enter the core group from a peripheral tier. Further research  at  the  individual  and  dyadic  levels  can  offer  further  insight  into  the  role  of  expressive valence in professional performance via social media.  Conclusion  Social  media,  or  interactive  online  media,  exist  as  conduits  for  relationships  and information. These are also the basis for public expressions of individual  and  collective  professional  identity.  Public  relations  practitioners  active  on  Twitter  voluntarily  enter  what  Andrejevic   2006   referred  to  as  the  digital  enclosure, or “the process whereby activities and transactions formerly carried  out beyond the monitoring capacity of the Internet are enfolded into its virtual  space”  p. 35 . Twitter, with its signature question, “What are you doing?,” is  the  latest  embodiment  of  the  digital  enclosure,  an  extension  of  the  larger  world of reality media.   It  is  within  this  world  that  practitioners  construct  their  own  professional  identity,  and  influence  the  larger  identity  of  the  public  relations  profession.  They do so by “publicly relating”: organizing into colloquys of peers who share  an interest in social media, and engaging in strategic online reputation manage- ment. These strategies have implications for the individual and collective pro- fessional futures of the participants as well as those who do not actively take  part in Twitter conversations or social media events. If indications that practi- tioners using Twitter focus considerable attention on social media persist, and  are  found  to  apply  more  generally,  it  is  possible  that  an  increasingly  sharp  dichotomy will emerge between traditional and socially mediated public rela- tions. Practitioners who construct their professional identity primarily through  their “public relating” are highly visible in search engine rankings and online  professional social networks, but this visibility is not necessarily a reliable indi- cator of overall expertise. It is possible that overemphasis on the public discus- sion  of  social  media  tactics,  to  the  exclusion  of  other  forms  of  relationship- building  communication  and  traditional  media  relations,  may  exaggerate the perceived importance of these tools within the public relations  profession.  Taken  to  extremes,  this  could  create  a  reputational  hierarchy  in  which  those  practitioners  heavily  engaged  in  Twitter  discussions  of  social    248    Convergent Practices  media are viewed as having greater overall professional capabilities, at least by  those who accept the constructed identity of public relations as a field largely  reliant on social media skills.   These observed patterns among Twitter users are also a reflection of larger  societal trends, since the fragmentation of online interactive channels as well  as reality programming in mainstream media have reinforced the notion that  “the applied art and science of self- presentation is something we are all increas- ingly  expected  to  draw  from,  to  various  degrees”   Ouellette  &  Hay,  2008,  p. 7 . As boundaries between personal and professional identities continue to  blur and erode, questions of self- presentation become increasingly complex.  The manner in which groups of individuals negotiate these questions, and vol- untarily engage in public practices aimed at “personal branding”—establishing  a constructed identity for themselves and for the groups or categories to which  they belong—is emerging as an important form of social interaction facilitated  by digital media. Thus the patterns of interaction within the professional Twit- tersphere of public relations practitioners are of significance beyond the con- fines  of  the  field,  and  are  worthy  of  further  inquiry  to  understand  new  directions in professional communication across fields.

Mendelson and Zizi Papacharissi  In recent years the popularity of social network sites  SNSs , such as Friendster,  MySpace, and Facebook, has expanded, enabling a culture of remote connec- tivity for young adults maintaining a variety of social ties to primary and sec- ondary groups of contact. This is especially true for college- age adults who use  SNSs  to  stay  connected  with  friends  and  family  dispersed  across  remote  or  nearby  locations.  These  networked  platforms  of  socially  oriented  activity  permit  an  introduction  of  the  self  via  public  displays  of  connection   boyd  &  Ellison, 2007; Donath & boyd, 2004; Papacharissi, 2002a, 2002b, 2009 . A  subsequent networked presentation of the self involves performative elements,  using a variety of tools and strategies to present tastes, likes, dislikes, affilia- tions,  and  in  general,  personality.  Such  a  performative  palette  on  sites  like  Facebook  might  include  listings  of  interests  and  favorite  music,  films,  and  books, linking to groups sharing points of view or interests, posting of com- ments  and  responses,  and,  relevant  to  this  chapter,  posting  and  labeling  of  photographs of one’s self and one’s friends. The purpose of this chapter is to  examine the use of photo galleries as an instrument of self presentation and a  means of visual autobiography online.   Photographs have long served a significant function of preserving biographi- cal memories. Albums of photographs—from tintype and cabinet card albums  in the mid- and late 1800s to digital galleries in the twenty- first century—are  used to tell and retell experiences shared by members of one’s family and by  one’s  wider  social  circle.  These  photographs  serve  as  mnemonic  devices  for  the moments that bond us together, sparking larger conversations within fam- ilies  Chalfen, 1987 . Further, they allows us, as Barthes  1981  suggests, to  search through the past and rediscover the truth of our loved ones. Similarly,  the  manner  in  which  college  students  portray  themselves  and  tag  others  through photographs on Facebook is a contemporary means of introducing the  self  and  performing  one’s  identity.  How  do  the  photos  selected,  presented,  and tagged help reify this mediated performance? If photos are taken for the    252    Convergent Practices  purpose of being displayed and tagged, does this render the experiences and  the  social  relationships  presented  more  real?  College  students  consciously  upload  and  tag  displayed  photographs,  thus  selecting  certain  subjects  and  events  to  emphasize.  Inspired  by  Chalfen’s   1987   examination  of  “how  we  construct,  manipulate,  interpret,  live  with,  participate  in,  and  generally  use  visual symbolic forms”  p. 5 , we examine how visual imagery is employed to  present the self and everyday college life via Facebook photo galleries. In this  study, we interrogate the photographs college students present of themselves  as important forms of symbolic creation of their worlds.  Self- Presentation and Social Network Sites   SNSs   In everyday life, people consciously and unconsciously work to define the way  they are perceived, hoping to engender positive impressions of themselves. This  effort entails emphasizing certain characteristics, through dress, hairstyle, behav- ior, and or speech, while hiding or diminishing other characteristics perceived  as flawed, depending on context. Goffman  1959  uses the term “performance”  to refer to “all the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves  to  influence  in  any  way  any  of  the  other  participants”   p.  15 .  Contemporary  scholars from a variety of disciplines argue that identity is performed, in its many  iterations, in contexts that are both virtual and real, mediated or not, offline or  online  Buckingham, 2008; Butler, 1990; Turkle, 1996 .   Research  on  self- presentation  has  moved  from  examining  interpersonal  interactions  to  displays  through  mass  media   Mendelson,  2007;  Meyrowitz,  1985  to more recent forms of new media in which elements of interpersonal  and  mass  communications  are  merged,  like  personal  homepages  and  blogs   Dominick,  1999;  Papacharissi,  2002a,  2002b;  Walker,  2000 .  New  media,  such as the World Wide Web, allow people the opportunity to present various  forms of themselves to others at a distance. People are able to post only that  information  which  presents  a  desired  image.  While  people  are  purportedly  presenting themselves, they are presenting a highly selective version of them- selves. Social network sites  SNSs  present the latest networked platform ena- bling self-presentation to a variety of interconnected audiences.   boyd  and  Ellison  argue   2007 ,  “SNSs  constitute  an  important  research  context  for  scholars  investigating  processes  of  impression  management,  self-  presentation,  and  friendship  perfomance”   p.  10 .  Indeed,  SNSs  afford  a  variety of tools that potentially extend and compromise impression manage- ment. In some cases, people create multiple versions of Facebook or MySpace  pages for different audiences  not unlike how we present different versions of  ourselves in face- to-face contexts ; one for peers and one for parents.   Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    253    Social network sites connect networks of individuals that may or may not  share a place- based connection. SNSs support varying types of interaction on  diverse and differing platforms. Some of the popular SNSs include MySpace,  Facebook, Cyworld, LinkedIn, and Bebo, among others, in terms of millions  of users attracted, but also in terms of public attention and scholarship focus.  Even though most SNSs are structured around a profile and a display of con- nections or friends, they may vary to the extent that they support additional  ser vices,  such  as  blogging   e.g.,  LiveJournal ,  audio visual  content  sharing   Flickr,  Last.FM,  YouTube ,  professional  orientation   LinkedIn ,  focus  on  status updates online and mobile connectivity  Twitter, Dodgeball , exclusive  membership  ASmallWorld , or specific ethnic, religious, sexual orientation,  and or particular content genres  Orkut, CyWorld . Donath & boyd  2004   define SNSs as:  on- line environments in which people create a self- descriptive profile and  then make links to other people they know on the site, creating a network  of  personal  connections.  Participants  in  social  network  sites  are  usually  identified  by  their  real  names  and  often  include  photographs;  their  network  of  connections  is  displayed  as  an  integral  piece  of  their  self-  presentation.   p. 72     People use SNSs to present aspects of themselves to their network. These  expressions can simultaneously express uniqueness and connection to others.  These  sites  are  about  establishing,  presenting,  and  negotiating  identity,  through the tastes and interests expressed  Liu, 2007 , those who we friend  and  highlight   Donath  and  boyd,  2004 ,  through  the  applications  we  add  to  our SNS pages, and through the pictures of us and our friends  boyd, 2004;  Donath,  2007 .  In  addition,  these  identity  presentations  are  supported  by  comments from other users.   SNSs  are  most  often  used  to  connect  with  individuals  people  know  from  offline environments, rather than for meeting new people online, differentiat- ing SNSs from online dating sites  Lampe, Ellison, & Steinfield, 2007; Lenhart  & Madden, 2007 . The number of people linked to SNSs is generally larger  than  those  one  would  communicate  with  on  a  regular  basis,  and  certainly  beyond  those  who  would  see  one’s  personal  photo  albums   boyd  &  Ellison,  2007; Donath, 2007 . Little of the research into SNSs has examined the posted  photographs  beyond  acknowledging  them  as  elements  of  self- presentation.  Still, photos play a large role in how identity is presented  Dominick, 1999 .  According to one study of teen use of SNSs, including Facebook, most users  do  post  photos  of  themselves  and  their  friends   Lenhart  &  Madden,  2007 ,    254    Convergent Practices  with  this  activity  being  more  popular  with  girls  than  boys.  Facebook’s  pub- lished statistics, at present, report over 250 million active users and more than  one  billion  photos  uploaded  every  month   Facebook  Press  Room,  Statistics,  2009 . The photographs on Facebook pages present a series of performances  strategically chosen by an individual.   The  photographic  life  of  young  adults,  including  college  students,  is  not  much understood, and relevant research is presented in the following section.  Thus,  Facebook  presents  a  useful  case  study  into  how  college  students  con- struct their lives through photographs.  Personal Photography  Personal  photographs  are  photographs  made  by  ourselves,  members  of  our  family, or peer group for our own use, not by professional photographers and  not for mass audiences  Chalfen, 1981; Slater, 1995 . These images are part of  a larger social practice which Chalfen  1987  refers to as the “Kodak culture,”  “whatever it is that one has to learn, know, or do in order to participate appro- priately in what has been outlined as the home mode of pictorial communica- tion”  p. 10 .   While  we  think  of  personal  photographs  as  rather  haphazard,  Chalfen   1987  and Musello  1980  argue that they are highly ritualized and conven- tionalized, with a rather limited range of subjects and events being recorded.  While there is theoretically an unlimited range of subjects to document, cul- tural practice dictates a rather more limited set of subjects and moments. Per- sonal  photographs  present  ideals,  emphasizing  how  we  wish  our  lives  to  be  remembered  Holland, 1997 . The positive is always recorded over the negat- ive,  with  moments  of  celebration  emphasized   King,  1986;  Slater,  1995 ,  especially those associated with lifetime milestones: birthdays, holidays, wed- dings. As Holland  1991  argues, these private pictures are entangled within  and influenced by larger cultural stories about community, family, and gender.  Personal  photographs  reaffirm  “culturally  structured  values”   Chalfen,  1987,  p. 98  through what is shown  Orhn, 1975 .   Relationships are also key aspects of personal photography, demonstrating  important bonds between family and friends. There is an evidentiary purpose  to personal photographs, providing proof of experiences and relationships for  ourselves and for others  Barthes, 1981; Jacobs, 1981 . These moments and  the  relationships  become  sanctified  through  their  documentation.  They  are  deemed  worthy  of  recording  and  preserving.  Digital  photography  has  expanded the range of subjects deemed photoworthy, with more emphasis on  the everyday and banal  Murray, 2008; Okabe & Ito, 2003 . Holland  1997   suggests  the   that  “Pictures  of   leisure  activities   increasingly   include    Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    255  carnivalesque—cross- dressing for the last- night party, sidling up to the Greek  waiter, the club outing when everyone was impossibly drunk, the risqué nude  image”  p. 137 .   There is normally a strong interaction between subject and photographer in  personal  photographs.  The  photographer  is  most  often  known  intimately  by  the subject, and both share an interest in making photographs that emphasize  how people would like to be seen. Further, personal photography is a social  activity,  where  people  actively  pose  for  each  other.  Holland   1991   argues  that:  “Recording  an  event  has  become  part  of  that  event—and  perhaps  the  most important part”  p. 2; see also Boerdam & Martinius, 1980 . Most sub- jects  pose  directly  before  the  lens,  looking  straight  ahead,  highly  aware  of  being photographed. The photographer holds the camera at eye level, empha- sizing the normalness of the viewpoint  Jacobs, 1981 . While the technology  of personal photography allows pictures to be made with the subject unaware,  this seldom occurs  Holland, 1991 .   We therefore consciously and unconsciously transform ourselves before the  camera,  portraying  a  version  of  ourselves  we  hope  to  be   Barthes,  1981;  Jacobs,  1981;  Slater,  1995 .  Boerdam  &  Martinius   1980   also  draw  on  Goffman:  “People  give  a  ‘performance’  when  they  allow  themselves  to  be  photographed, in the sense that they make allowance for a public that will ulti- mately see the photograph”  p. 109 .   The  presentation  of  personal  photos  is  also  highly  ritualized.  The  social  process dictates not only how these photos are made, but also to whom they  are  shown.  These  are  not  meant  for  mass  audiences.  They  are  meant  for  people who were known “personally” to the subjects in the images  Chalfen,  1987; King, 1986 . The photos are produced for and consumed by those sub- jects  and  photographers  and  slightly  larger  circle  of  friends  and  relatives.  Chalfen states that: “Ordered collections of home mode imagery are repeat- edly telling the same ‘stories’ according to some master scenario- stories based  on  the  pictorial  rendering  and  unfolding  of  an  interpretation  of  experienced  daily life and the ‘punctuation’ of special experiences”  p. 142 . These collec- tions  “deliver  culturally  significant  tales  and  myths  about  ourselves  to  our- selves”  p. 142 .   Most  people’s  photographs  are  edited  depending  on  the  viewing  audience.  Some  images  are  displayed  at  work,  some  in  frames  in  the  home,  some  in  albums, and still others are kept for personal viewing only or destroyed. Per- sonal  photo  albums  are  generally  organized  chronologically  from  oldest  to  newest, as well as around specific events  Miller & Edwards, 2007 . Albums are  not structured around a narrative. As Chalfen  1987  suggests: “The narrative  remains in the heads of the picturemakers and on- camera participants for verbal  telling and re- telling during exhibition events”  p. 70; see also Holland, 1991 .   256    Convergent Practices    The  production  and  presentation  of  personal  photographs  connects  with  Carey’s  1975  notion of the ritual view of communication: “In a ritual defini- tion, communication is linked to terms such as sharing, participation, associ- ation, fellowship, and the possession of a common faith”  p. 6 . These types of  photos  help  build  and  sustain  social  groups  by  communicating  shared  values  and stories. These images play an important role in perpetuating memories for  a  group,  calling  up  moments  for  reflection  and  reminiscence.  They  are  the  visual myths, capturing the best moments to be told and retold, or as Sturken   1999   says,  photos  are  “an  artifact  used  to  conjure  memory,  nostalgia,  and  contemplation”  p. 178; see also Hirsch, 1999 .   Little research has examined the photographic worlds from the early adult- hood  time  of  life  after  high  school  graduation.  This  is  certainly  because  the  albums Chalfen examined were controlled by parents and not the young adults  themselves. Tinkler’s  2008  overview of research on young people’s photo- graphic  practices  echoes  this.  She  suggests  “Until  recently,  however,  most  children had little say over how they were represented in amateur, commer- cial  or  institutional  photographs”   p.  258 .  She  goes  on  to  argue:  “Today,  young  people  from  across  the  social- class  spectrum  have  a  wider  range  of  opportunities  for  photographic  self  representation  due  to  the  availability  of  cheap . . . cameras”  p. 258 . Digital technology has placed cameras and photo- graphs in the hands of almost all. And Facebook, Flickr, Snapfish, and other  sites allow for sharing of photographs easily with others.   In  networked  environments  that  blend  private  and  public  boundaries,  like  SNSs,  personal  photographs  can  traverse  a  multiplicity  of  audiences,  to  which  these photographic narratives are of variable coherence and relevance. Yet, since  they all emanate from the ego- centered basis of SNSs like Facebook, they inad- vertently communicate content of a performative nature to a variety of audiences.  In order to better understand the worlds and accompanying narratives college stu- dents  visually  construct  for  themselves,  our  analysis  is  guided  by  the  following  general thematic questions: What kinds of visual narratives do college students  construct through the display of photo galleries on Facebook? What are the defin- ing elements of the visual rhetoric presented by Facebook photo galleries? Finally,  what sense of self is presented via the visual storytelling media of Facebook? By  examining visual depictions of behaviors broadcast to a simultaneity of public and  private audiences, we hope to better understand the nature of identities that are  performed on online spaces on the basis of experiences lived offline.  Method  We  chose  to  analyze  college  students’  photos  qualitatively  using  methods  based in visual anthropology and semiotics in order to capture the richness of    Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    257  the images, in addition to the more subtle aspects of the presentations. This  qualitative  analysis  was  guided  primarily  by  Chalfen’s   1987   “event-  component  framework”  for  analyzing  home  mode  forms  of  communication.  This framework contains two axes—events and components—each made up  of  five  elements.  The  events  Chalfen  details  are:  Planning—“any  action s   in  which there is a formal or informal decision regarding the production of a pho- tographic image s ”  p. 20 ; Shooting: on- camera—“any action s  that in some  way structures the person s  or thing s  that ‘happens’ in front of the operat- ing camera”  pp. 21–22 ; Shooting: behind camera—“any action s  not in front  of the camera but which in some way still structures the use and operation of  it”  p. 22 ; Editing—“any action s  which transforms, accumulates, eliminates,  arranges or rearranges images”  p. 23 ; and Exhibition—“any action s  which  occurs after shooting, in which photographic . . . imagery is shown and viewed  in a public context”  p. 25 . We adopted Chalfen’s accompanying definition of  public as “any audience that consists of more than the picture- taker or editor”   p. 25 . We focused on the last event, the exhibition, in our analysis of photo  albums as presented through Facebook. We also employed his five components  of home mode imagery, as a guide for our analysis: Participants—this concerns  “identifying people who take pictures, appear in pictures, and look at pictures”   p. 27 ; Topic “describes image content in terms of the subject matter, activ- ities, events, and themes that are presented in pictures”  p. 29 ; Setting “refers  to  when  and  where  a  particular  communication  event  takes  place”   p.  30 ;  Message form—“the physical form, ‘shape’ or kind of picture”  p. 31 ; and Code  “includes the characteristics that define a particular message form or ‘style’ of  image construction and composition,” focusing on the conventions that define  the nature of the photographic images  p. 32 . In addition, Chalfen suggests  that the visual alone is not enough to understand how these forms of commu- nication  are  used.  Scholars  must  also  examine  verbal  information  included  with the images, such as captions or titles. To this end, we examined visual  identifications of photographed subjects or “tags,” and commentary accompa- nying all photographs.   In addition to Chalfen’s framework, this analysis was informed by semiotic  analysis,  which  attempted  to  qualitatively  place  content  in  a  larger  cultural  context of meaning, looking for recurring patterns of presences and absences   Hall, 1975; Rose, 2001 . The choice of one subject over another frames our  understanding of an event. Thus, it is also necessary to consider what was not  chosen for inclusion in the photographs  Fiske, 1990; Szarkowski, 1966; Tra- chtenberg, 1989; van Leeuwen, 2001 . Choices of what to include are only  one  aspect;  we  must  also  examine  how  the  different  choices  are  combined.  Meaning is created by the relationships among the present signs  Fiske, 1990 .  The  entire  body  of  work  must  be  examined  to  ascertain  these  patterns  of    258    Convergent Practices  representation. While people are theoretically free to record and post pictures  of anything, there are limitations based on these norms or conventions of what  is acceptable or reasonable. Based on Chalfen, we examined the Participants,  Topics,  Setting,  Form,  Code   aesthetics ,  as  revealed  through  the  photos  exhibited when clicking on the profile link, “See Photos of.”   Participants in an online survey on Facebook uses  Papacharissi & Mendel- son, 2008  were contacted by a graduate assistant for the purpose of accessing  their photos. The participants were informed that their photos would be kept  confidential. All photos of those agreeing to participate in this portion of the  study  were  collected  by  producing  portable  document  files  of  their  photo  pages. For this study, we examined the “photos of ” each person to get a sense  of how college students are portrayed by themselves and their friends through  the  processes  of  posting  and  tagging  photographs.  This  examination  did  not  focus specifically on the albums each person posted, but on the overall collec- tion  of  photos  featuring  the  person  whose  pages  we  were  examining.  Cur- rently,  the  architecture  of  Facebook  groups  all  tagged  photos  of  a  person  together, regardless of whether they are posted by the subject or by others.  When  a  subject’s  Facebook  page  opens,  there  is  a  link  under  their  profile  photo  which  reads,  “View  Photos  of  me,”  containing  all  the  images  we  ana- lyzed.  Based  on  the  above  method,  the  lead  author  examined  every  photo- graph  found  when  clicking  on  the  “Photos  of ”  from  the  student’s  Facebook  homepage  and  every  comment  posted  about  the  photos,  producing  a  total  n = 20,962 photos examined, and n = 13,543 comments analyzed.  Analysis  Before going further into the qualitative analysis, we begin with some descrip- tive  results  from  the  close- ended  survey  of  college  students   N = 333   from  which  this  sample  was  drawn  in  order  to  provide  a  descriptive  sense  of  the  popularity of photo posting and tagging. Women reported having more photos  on their pages  4.36 vs. 3.48, on a 1–5 scale; F 1  = 38.18, p = 0.000 , being  more likely to post photos  3.22 vs. 2.51; F 1  = 47.26, p = 0.000 , and more  likely to tag photos than men  3.02 vs. 2.5; F 1  = 20.6, p = 0.000 . Further,  the size of one’s social group, as defined by the number of friends participants  reported having, was positively correlated with the number of photos a person  reported  having   r = 0.39,  p = 0.000 .  Finally,  the  number  of  photos  corre- lated most strongly with maintained  r = 0.23, p = 0.000  and bonding social  capital   r = 0.20,  p = 0.000   measures,  reflecting  the  extent  of  past  ties  sus- tained and close ties strengthened respectively on Facebook. As we will see,  the  college  students’  photographs  are  focused  most  strongly  on  social  relationships.   Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    259  Qualitative Analysis  A total of 89 students who participated in the survey were willing to have their  photos  more  closely  examined.  This  sample  comprised  37  males  and  52  females.  For  this  group,  the  number  of  photos  ranged  from  1  to  1,523   mean = 236;  sd = 3.11;  median = 124 ,  while  the  number  of  comments  ranged from zero to 1,348  mean = 152; sd = 2.11; median = 83 . Not surpris- ingly, women had more photos of themselves  whether posted by themselves  or  others ,  averaging  337  to  men’s  average  number  of  photos  of  93   t 58  = 4.6; p = 0.000 . Likewise women  mean = 213  had more comments  about their photos than men  mean = 66; t 69  = 3.9; p = 0.000 . The number  of  photos  was  highly  correlated  with  the  number  of  comments   r = 0.716;  p = 0.000 .  Because  these  students  were  enrolled  in  an  introductory  mass  communication class, most were freshmen or sophomores.   The  results  of  this  chapter  are  organized  around  Chalfen’s  categories  of  analysis:  the  subject  matter  present  in  the  photographs   participants,  topics,  and settings  as well as what subject matter doesn’t show up or shows up very  little; the behavior of subjects; the photographic aesthetics of the images; the  organization of the photographs; and, finally, an analysis of the comments.  Participants, Topics, Settings  Relationships are the dominant subject matter in all the photographs. The vast  majority of the photos are of pairings or groups of friends, mostly of the same  gender, posing for the camera at formal or planned events, such as parties or  sporting  events.  This  includes  photos  taken  by  a  separate  photographer  and  those shot by one of the subjects holding a camera out to photograph him or  herself with a friend or friends, and was the norm for both men and women.  Men  were  most  often  photographed  with  male  friends,  and  women  with  women.   The  dominance  of  the  same- sex  subjects  in  photos  can  most  strongly  be  seen in high school prom photos encountered in the analysis. While there were  photos of a person posing with his or her date, pinning on a boutonniere or  corsage, or group shots of a series of couples posing in front of a house, the  vast  majority  of  photos  presented  either  groups  of  female  friends  posing  in  their  dresses  together,  or  groups  of  male  friends  posing  together  in  their  tuxedos. The bonding of same- sex friends even at a couples’ event was of the  most  importance.  Similarly,  high  school  graduation  occasions  often  featured  images of the subject posing with same- sex friends in their caps and gowns.   The  prevalence  of  same- sex  group  photos  does  not  imply  the  absence  of  photos of people of the opposite sex together. At party settings, both male and    260    Convergent Practices  female  participants  were  photographed  with  members  of  the  opposite  sex,  posing in a platonic manner, or together, in large group photos featuring eve- ryone present at the party. But overall, photographs revealed the importance  of  one’s  peer  group,  most  often  for  these  first-  and  second- year  students,  members of the same gender. Pictures with members of the opposite sex were  posed in much of the same way as those with same- sex friends. They revealed  mostly  friendships  rather  than  romantic  connections  or  even  significant  flirtation.   Once a person has a significant other of the opposite sex, the content of the  posted  photographs  do  change.  In  those  cases,  the  relationship  became  the  main focus of the photographic narrative, through the frequent posting of pic- tures of the couple alone  taken by a third party or by themselves holding a  camera out , or posing with a group of one of the partner’s same- sex friends.  The  romantic  relationships  were  also  demonstrated  and  confirmed  visually  through  the  amount  of  physical  contact,  usually  reflected  through  sitting  on  the other’s lap, hugging each other, and heads together.   Certain events were repeated within and across most of the college student  photo  collections.  These  mostly  included  typical  planned  high  school  and  college activities or rituals: parties, road trips with friends  to the beach, to  New York City , dances and proms, school- year holidays  such as Halloween  and St. Patrick’s Day , college sporting events, and, to a lesser extent, profes- sional sporting events, and high school graduation. The recording and posting  of  a  subject’s  participation  in  the  social  rituals  of  college  is  central.  For  example, a series of a group of male friends painting their chest in team colors,  each with a letter of the school on his chest, was photographed, both during  the painting process and at the actual sporting event. Still, almost any moment  shared  by  friends  is  worthy  to  be  recorded.  Several  other  photos  depicted  driving in a car, riding on the subway, walking someplace, or eating at a fast- food restaurant. Friendships were confirmed through the inclusion of road trip  photos, showing friends posing on the beach in swimming suits, at sites in the  location being visited, such as Times Square in New York City, or in restaur- ants around a table.   Parties presented by far the most common setting for photos. These were  most  often  posed  photographs  of  groups  of  friends,  often  with  bottles  of  beer or plastic cups in hand. Occasionally there were bottles of hard liquor  shown. Few photos showed cigarette smoking. Drug usage or paraphernalia  were also not present. Because of the age group under study, bars were less  often the setting for drinking. Still, there was little or no effort to hide or  avoid photographing underage drinking. In fact, it was most often blatantly  included in the frame, by holding the bottle or glass up high or out toward  the camera.   Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    261    The importance of parties is reflected in the prevalence of certain holidays,  such as Halloween and St. Patrick’s Day, both holidays associated with parties  and  drinking.  The  vast  majority  of  students  had  photos  of  Halloween,  most  often  posing  before  a  party  in  one’s  apartment  or  residence  hall  in  costume  with one’s same- sex friends. Outfits were important for St. Patrick’s Day as  well,  as  photos  reveal  the  typical  bright  green  shirt  and  green  party  hats.  Apparel  becomes  important  to  the  various  rituals  of  college  life.  Costumes  were  naturally  prominent  in  Halloween  party  photos,  green  outfits  for  St.  Patrick’s  Day,  while  sporting  events  photos  featured  subjects  donning  team  wear, displaying team or college affiliation. Photos would typically be taken in  said outfits beforehand at one’s apartment or dorm, on the subway, or in a car  going to the event, tailgating beforehand in the parking lot, and sitting in the  stands.   These  rituals  of  college  life  seemed  largely  gender  neutral,  being  equally  common  for  male  and  female  photographed  subjects.  In  contrast,  a  visible  gender  divide  became  apparent  in  “hanging  out”  photos;  that  is,  photos  of  relaxation or “down time” in one’s apartment or dorm, in casual clothing, such  as  sweats  and  t- shirts   i.e.,  not  dressed  to  go  out ,  most  often  again  with  members of one’s gender. Women were much more likely to have photos of  these  moments,  and  these  included  laughing  together,  eating  pizza,  dyeing  someone’s hair, and just talking. Another common photo for women was the  reflection shot with another friend in a bathroom mirror. This could be in an  apartment  bathroom,  but  this  was  also  seen  in  bar  bathrooms.  Most  often  these  presented  a  series  of  at  least  three  or  four  photos  with  the  subjects  playing with poses. Some women produced these mirror photographs of just  themselves. Men were likely only to have pictures of actual formal events.   Portraits of the subjects alone were present, though they did not outnum- ber  photos  with  friends.  Portraits  were  taken  by  the  subject  holding  out  a  camera,  using  a  mirror,  or  by  using  a  computer  camera.  Some  men  and  women would play with poses of themselves, posting a series of photos made  at the same time with different body positions or facial expressions.   Certain  types  of  settings  were  not  encountered  often,  although  it  bears  repeating  that  the  photos  of  each  subject  are  not  necessarily  all  the  photos  taken of this subject, but only the selection of photos that have been posted  and  tagged.  With  this  in  mind,  most  of  the  students  displayed  no  images  of  themselves  with  family  members,  specifically  with  family  members  of  older  generations,  including  parents  or  grandparents.  Similarly,  few  people  had  photographs with very young children. The few cases where parents appeared  were  at  family  functions  such  as  holiday  parties  or  weddings,  or  of  parents  socializing with the subject and his her peer group. In one case, a mother and  father were playing beer pong with their college- aged daughter and her friends    262    Convergent Practices  at their house. Family members, when they did appear, were more often to  show  up  in  photos  before  college  started,  up  through  the  summer  before  freshman year. A few  though very few  new baby pictures were present, in  the form of children of siblings. Older people appeared in the form of a celeb- rity, an athlete, or service personnel at a resort or restaurant with whom the  friends are posing.   Negative  events,  such  as  illnesses  or  serious  accidents,  were  absent  from  these galleries. However, other, less somber yet embarrassing or “bad” photos  remained,  even  when  someone  commented  that  this  was  awful  or  that  they  could not believe a photo was posted. The fact that the images and the com- ments  were  seen  suggest  that  the  commenter  was  not  concerned  enough  to  remove the image. One example is of a series of a girl dancing crazily with a  drink  in  her  hand,  licking  a  girl’s  face,  and  licking  the  top  of  a  girl  friend’s  chest. The fact that the image remains posted suggests she did not feel this was  embarrassing enough to take down, possibly containing some type of meaning  for her and her peer group. To another embarrassing photo, the subject com- mented:  “Bad  hair!!!!  DESTROY!  DESTROY!”  Similarly,  another  person  commented on a different photo: “LMAO hey hey. i thought we had an under- standing that this night never happened. shush, [name removed] babe. trying  to find our buried secrets.” Despite the private nature of the event described  and the information revealed, these pictures remain on public display, suggest- ing  that  their  publicity  surpasses  the  stated  discontent  or  embarrassment  brought on by the displayed image.   Landscapes  and  cityscapes  without  people  in  them  were  seldom  posted.  Landscapes were seen in photos of the subject or the subject and friends posing  in  the  foreground  of  a  wider  image  while  on  a  trip,  thus  documenting  the  shared  experience  of  being  someplace  together.  Most  of  the  travel  images  were  likewise  images  of  the  subject  with  his  or  her  friends—for  example,  posing with characters at Disney World along with friends. Most of the sub- jects never appeared with animals, whether pets from their parents’ house or  pets they own in school. This latter example is not surprising since most of the  subjects were still living in a dorm where pets are not allowed. Finally, images  of  students  in  classes  or  other  academic  campus  buildings,  or  studying  any- where, were absent, thus visually removing the academic side of the college  experience from the college- based presentation of the self.  Behaviors  Beyond subject matter, we looked at the types of activities and behaviors sub- jects  were  pursuing  in  the  photos.  What  became  immediately  apparent  was  that subjects were almost always aware of and interacting with the camera    Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    263  photographer. There were few candid photos taken or photos where the sub- jects were caught completely unaware. Most of the behavior was intentionally  photographic  in  what  would  be  considered  a  formal  pose,  standing  and  smiling, facing the camera. Subjects were most often physically close to each  other,  with  parts  of  their  bodies  touching  and  their  heads  leaning  into  each  other. Whereas women were more likely to be hugging someone in the photo  with  them,  men  would  merely  stand  physically  close  to  each  other  or  have  their  arms  around  each  other.  But  even  this  difference  diminished  at  parties   presumably  through  the  presence  of  alcohol ,  as  men  can  often  be  seen  hugging as well.   Furthermore, there was much exaggerated behavior directed to the camera,  reflecting a variety of poses and a playful attitude. This was apparent through  broad  gestures   e.g.,  arms  up  above  the  head ,  exaggerated  poses  and  facial  expressions, such as large grins or laughing, sticking out one’s tongue at the  camera.  Other  behavior  directed  at  the  camera  was  overt  drinking,  which  included being photographed drinking with  a friend,  playing drinking  games  such as beer pong, or drinking from a liquor bottle. Most of these students are  underage, and did not appear overly concerned with the illegality of underage  drinking. The few candid photos were typically of play at a party, including  drinking  and  drinking  games,  dancing  and  playing,  often  in  a  series  with  at  least one image showing an awareness of the camera. People were also photo- graphed outside of party situations, just goofing around with friends, playing  outside, jumping on a friend’s back, or laughing with friends.   Women  were  more  likely  to  strike  poses  that  were  flirtatious  or  sexy.  Women often posed in exaggerated sexy poses with each other, showing leg  or exaggerating their cleavage. They also were more likely to cant their heads  together  for  a  pose.  Their  sexy  poses  were  often  recognized  and  compli- mented through comments from both male and female friends.   Many  students  generally  have  developed  clear  ways  of  posing  for  photo- graphs by the end of their high school years. This is especially true for women.  There are often series of images of women alone or with friends in a non- event  setting, practicing posing. Mirror shots allow immediate feedback on how one  is posing before the camera. In one example, a young women practices posing,  a slight arch to her back, hand on hip, head slightly canted, even in self shots.  This becomes her consistent poses throughout college images. Another guy is  referred to in comments as always being in “picture mode,” having a specific  look for the camera even in casual situations.   There  was  seldom  overt  sexual  behavior,  including  few  photos  of  people  kissing on the lips. Lip- to-lip kissing was an indicator of a more serious rela- tionship, and limited to those with significant others. On the other hand, the  kissing of another person’s cheek was very common, both across and within    264    Convergent Practices  the same gender. Kissing on the cheek was almost always highly exaggerated  and comical, with laughter on the faces of both people. While this was very  common  for  women,  men  could  also  be  seen  kissing  the  cheeks  of  women  and, to a lesser extent, men  the latter was usually at a party and thus follow- ing the consumption of a certain amount of alcohol . The cheek kiss seemed to  indicate a sign of close friendship.   Sexual  behavior  of  any  sort  between  non- serious  couples  was  not  photo- graphed. There was only one photograph that showed a male subject at a dis- tance kissing a girl. Comments revealed this was a one- time occurrence, with  no other such “hook ups” documented and posted.  Aesthetics  The majority of the photos were centered and taken straight on with the sub- jects posed, looking at the camera photographer. This is not surprising given  that  most  of  the  photographers  were  not  professionals  and  they  were  using  point- and-shoot cameras. What would be considered more sophisticated com- position  e.g., rule of thirds, selective use of focus, foreground framing, etc.   was seldom seen. Most were taken at a medium to close distance, thus limit- ing the amount of background in the photos. The context of the photos mate- rialized largely in the minds of the participants and viewers. One party tends  to  look  much  like  another  to  outsiders.  Captions  can  reveal  contextual  information identifying a specific party, but, like family photo collections, cap- tions weren’t always included, beyond the tagged names of the subjects in the  photos.  The  distance  between  the  subjects  and  the  photographer  mainly  depended upon the number of people to be included in the photographs. The  majority  of  group  shots  were  a  single  horizontal  line  facing  the  camera:  the  more subjects, the further back the photographer had to stand. Wider shots  were used when proof of a shared experience was needed, such as a wider shot  with a football stadium in the background or a wider shot of friends posing in  Times Square.   Another common aesthetic format was the “self shot,” holding the camera  out  to  capture  one’s  self  and,  at  times,  friends.  The  photographer subject’s  arm was thus seen extending to the corner of the frame and this often led to a  slightly  tilted  horizon  line.  The  act  of  including  others  in  a  self- shot  photo  demonstrates both a certain spontaneity  “we must capture this moment now”   and confirms the closeness of the friends  “I want to take a photo with you” .  Whereas  a  photo  taken  by  someone  else  could  be  set  up,  self- shot  photos  revealed a greater agency in determining the subject matter.   Webcam shots were often manipulated using the distortion controls of the  image  capture  software.  These  allow  for  identity  play  by  stretching  or    Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    265  compressing one’s image. Often, webcam photos appear in a series, revealing  different facial expressions in each shot. Finally, photos that were badly com- posed,  such  as  those  where  people  were  cut  off  or  tilted,  and  those  which  were under- or over- lit, were still posted, assuming the content was of inter- est. People would still be tagged in a photo, even if only part of them could be  seen.  Analysis—Organization  Similar to weblogs, the photographs of each subject were in a reverse chrono- logical  order,  with  the  most  recent  images  first.  Further,  like  most  family  photo albums, there was no clear structured narrative, but pictures were just  organized around time. Unlike most family albums, which are based around a  single photographer, the “photos of  ” each person are collective, based on all  the  images  posted  by  the  subject  and  his  or  her  friends  through  tags.  The  current  architecture  of  Facebook  collects  all  pictures  tagged  with  a  person’s  name under profile pictures, although individuals do have the option of “untag- ging,”  and  thus  removing  their  name,  but  not  their  image,  from  the  photo- graph. In most family albums, the photographer is not often in the album or  collection as often. With Facebook, the subject is often in most of the photos  in a collection.   The collective nature of this photo collection can create a deviation from  chronological orders, depending on when different people post pictures from  the  same  event.  Further,  people  often  post  intentionally  “nostalgic”  photos  from childhood or even earlier in high school, before Facebook. As we will see  in  the  next  section  examining  comments,  friends  react  to  these  images  in  a  nostalgic way, remembering good times together in the past.   Finally, in all photos, the camera becomes part of the event. A number of  people have and use cameras, as evidenced by the number of people posting  images  from  the  same  event.  Thus,  there  is  a  certain  triangulation  of  the  friendship circle, since the same groupings appear through the lens of multiple  cameras.  This  is  true  for  all  events,  even  the  most  formal,  such  as  proms.  Moreover, the photographer is clearly known by and a member of the social  cohort  depicted.  Poses  that  would  be  unlikely  to  an  unknown  photographer  are quite common; including “hamminess” and “flipping off ” the photographer  in jest.  Comments  The comments posted by friends reinforce group cohesiveness and closeness.  Comments  are  tied  to  the  pictures,  not  to  the  individual,  meaning  that    266    Convergent Practices  everyone tagged in the photos will have the same set of shared comments. The  group  nature  of  comments  can  be  seen  through  the  consistent  use  of  nick- names, references to inside jokes or past events, statements of affection and  compliments, and gentle ribbing of each other. All these examples are under- stood by those in the know. The context of friendship allows for statements  that  those  outside  the  group  cannot  make  or  would  possibly  find  offensive.  Comments allow friends to relive the pictured events, emphasizing the shared  good times. Examples of this include statements such as, “OMG THIS IS SO  SWEET! i remember this! We were interviewedddddd!”  sic . There are also  references to longing or missing members of one’s friendship circle away at  other schools, such as, “aww I miss this” or “I miss you guys.” Comments rein- force  the  group’s  participation  in  college  rituals,  for  example  this  series  of  comments about posing with alcohol:  PerSoN a:   water??? PerSoN b:   if that’s what you like to call it . . . PerSoN C:   and mommy and daddy think your sooo innocent. not fair PerSoN b:   that’s why i’m the favorite:   sic   People  also  relive  embarrassing  moments  through  comments,  especially  related  to  behavior  while  drunk,  such  as  craziness  and  passing  out.  For  example, “ left that shirt at my crib when u passed out in a bush . . .”  sic . Or  “Whats that mark on my sweatshirt?” in reference to a stain from vomiting.   Many statements reflect a desire to be included in the group, whether to be  included in the event pictured or to be tagged if one is pictured: “can someone  please explain why no one tagged me in this!!!!” or “it still means ur ass needs  to get the hellzz down there woman.” This last quote supports the group of  friends through their absence, by expressing the desire for the left out indi- vidual to come visit.   Typically, the same recurring group of people will tend to comment on the  photos, again demonstrating the tightness of the social group. Comments are not  always about the content of the photos. The photos often bring up the opportun- ity for an extended conversation about individuals in the social group. The con- versations sparked by a photo can encompass many posts extending over a period  of time  even more than a year between the first and last comment on a photo .  Comments continue a dialogue for those at a specific event and those who were  not there but are part of the extended social network. Thus, these photo collec- tions,  like  Facebook  in  general,  allow  vicarious  participation  in  friends’  lives  even  at  a  distance.  People  use  comments  and  the  photos  to  keep  updated  on  their friends, such as “wtf bro when was this?”  sic . Photos can be used to link  up with more distant friends: “adorable! how ya been chica?”   Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    267  Discussion  Carey   1975   emphasized  a  ritual  view  of  communication,  which  helps  foster  community integration through the sharing of common experiences and values.  This is clearly central to what is revealed in the collections of Facebook photos of  college students. The commonality of the images within each student’s collec- tion, and between all the students, demonstrates that, while the outfits and loca- tions change, the types of events documented and the nature of the poses do not.  The  same  stories  are  told  and  retold  in  these  photographs.  These  images  are  highly conventional, both in terms of their subject matter and their aesthetics.  These images record social rituals of college life, with little of the academic side.   These Facebook photos do not necessarily represent all photos taken by or  of a person. These merely represent those images that a student or a friend has  chosen to post and tag for others. Thus, these photos represent a strategic rep- resentation  of  a  social  group  and  social  life  in  college.  More  than  anything,  these photos allow college students to speak to each other visually, playing out  their college lives for each other. These photos establish proof of an authentic  college experience, one filled with friends and the rituals of college life, drink- ing, sports, and the closeness of a peer group. They do more than merely doc- ument the rituals. This is readily apparent by noticing what is lacking, images  of parents and images without friends. These photos help confirm one’s inde- pendence from family and childhood.   These images demonstrate the primacy of relationships. The photos are all  about  the  connection  among  college  students;  and,  for  these  primarily  first-  and second-year students, among those of the same gender. This echoes other  authors who have argued that friends are especially important for members of  Generation Y  Huntley, 2006 , especially same- sex friends. It is interesting to  see the change in focus of the photos as a serious relationship with a member  of the opposite sex occurs. Images of the couple begin to dominate. Chalfen   1987  had pointed out that college life was absent in the albums he examined.  This study allows a glimpse at the transition from being part of a family to an  independent photographic entity in one’s own right. Further, the transition to  a  couple  reflected  the  possible  beginnings  of  a  family  collection  of  photos,  focused around a dyad and not a larger peer group. For the larger peer group,  images of embarrassment as well as joy draw friends together, helping support  the  authentic  college  experience  and  bond  one’s  friends.  Close  friends  are  expected to share both positive and negative moments, and only close friends  would  appreciate  and  decode  embarrassing  images  in  the  correct  spirit  of  group- bonding. These images are the equivalent of the gentle ribbing seen in  the comments. Further, opening up oneself to potential ridicule demonstrates  the trust extended to one’s peer group.   268    Convergent Practices    Proof of the closeness of one’s peer group is confirmed by both the quantity  and  nature  of  pictures  displayed.  The  closer  the  relationships  shared  among  friends, the more frequently they appear in photos with a student. Likewise,  the more they appear, the more their friendship is confirmed. The poses and  moments  also  reveal  the  closeness  of  friends.  For  women,  this  included  moments of informal hanging out in one’s residence. For both genders, this  included physical closeness  including hugging and cheek kissing  and exagger- ated poses. Physical closeness was most strongly seen when a student entered  a serious relationship. Physical closeness indexes emotional closeness.   As  stated  earlier  and  consistent  with  previous  work  on  personal  photo- graphs, the meaning of these images is constructed largely in the minds of the  viewers  and  is  intended  for  members  of  one’s  social  group.  Contextual  information about location and time was largely absent. These photos facilitate  the recall of already existing memories, as evidenced by the posting of older  photographs from childhood, which required no caption. Members of the peer  group recognized and responded to these nostalgic photos. By understanding  the meaning in the photos, the cohesiveness of the social group was enhanced.  Contextual elements, through backgrounds, are de- emphasized, suggesting the  primacy of the human relationships and the existing knowledge in the minds of  viewers  required  for  decoding  the  images.  Facebook  images  were  clearly  appropriated by a closed group, used to reinforce membership and cohesive- ness. Group membership affords a full understanding of the overt and latent  meanings  of  photos  and,  subsequently,  identifying  these  overt  and  latent  meanings potentially enhanced one’s sense of belonging.   The  photos  portray  college  students  suspended  in  sociality,  perpetually  bonding with friends and toasting the best of times. Events are opportunities  to connect with friends, and by representing those moments in posted Face- book photos reinforces the bonds of the relationships. While one game blurs  into another and one party into another, the photographs of them tell a larger  story of the importance of shared experiences of college life with one’s closest  friends. Once posted, these photographs create instant “good old days” upon  which friends can reminisce and feel nostalgic, even if the event occurred just  last  night.  For  men,  the  sociality  ends  at  formal  events,  emphasizing  the  importance of “drinking buddies,” for women, sociality exists in both formal  and informal moments. Women’s friendships are built as much at parties as  they  are  lounging  in  dorm  rooms,  reinforcing  previous  work  on  the  impor- tance of girls’ bedroom culture in establishing identity and friendships  Nayak  & Kehily, 2008 .   Because  pictures  are  posted  by  multiple  people,  the  photo  galleries  are  dynamic.  These  collections  of  photos  are  potentially  always  changing,  thus  presenting a confluent plane of activity upon which performances of the self    Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in Facebook Photos    269  are enacted, and “tagged.” Just as people remove individuals from their home  photo albums when divorce happens, Facebook collections can also change as  individuals  remove  photos.  This  action  removes  the  photos  from  the  collec- tions of all who are tagged on the photos, as well as the comments attached.  Thus, the convergent nature of the platform allows these performances to con- stantly evolve and forever elude permanence, as they are subject to the mul- tiple  redactions  of  numerous  audiences.  This  convergent  context  simultaneously references  spaces  and  evolves  beyond  space,  presenting  what  de Certeau  1984  has termed “a moving map,” upon which visual depictions  of memories are pieced into narratives through the practice of “tagging.” The  fluid context upon which performances of the self are enacted affords reflex- ively shaped personal narratives of the self, which are indicative of what soci- ologists have described as a constant state of flux or liquid modernity  Bauman,  2005; Giddens, 1990 .   Interestingly  enough,  the  aesthetics  and  the  form  of  the  displayed  photos  place  the  self  or  multiple  subjects  at  the  center,  frequently  through  camera  placement that may appear awkward or unprofessional. The emphasis on the  self is highlighted by the absence of contextual information, medium to close  distance,  limited  background,  awareness  of  the  camera,  and  behaviors  pro- duced specifically for the camera by a single or several subjects. The totality of  these  behaviors  reflect  a  collectively  performed  narcissism,  through  which  a  single or multiple subjects exhibit self- referential behavior, that is then expo- nentially tagged, re- tagged, commented, and referenced in further introspec- tive moments that culminate to group cohesion. These traces of narcissism are  present  in  photographs  that  contain  a  single,  two,  or  multiple  subjects;  the  theme in common, reflective of narcissism, is the connoted enamorment with  the subject, dyad, or group photographed.   Given  the  general  content  of  these  visual  galleries,  which  are  structured  around  articulating  individual  autonomy  and  signaling  independence  from  family and affiliation with peer groups, it would be more meaningful and accur- ate to interpret these narcissistic lapses as a step toward self- reflection and self-  actualization,  rather  than  instances  of  uncontrollable  self- absorption.  Lasch   1979  connected narcissistic behaviors to hedonistic tendencies reflective of a  materialistic culture, but also clarified that, while narcissistic behavior may be  structured around the self, it is not motivated by selfish desire, but by a desire  to better connect the self to society. Alternatively, in Sennet’s  1974  terms,  narcissism “takes the idea of the involuntary disclosure of character to its logical  extreme,” thus affording identity play and the performative extremes that we  identified in this study. Moreover, the aesthetics of these photographs reflect  what Mitchell  1995  calls “meta- photography,” that is, photographs that reveal  the  process  of  picture- making.  These  meta- photographs  demonstrate  the    270    Convergent Practices  manner in which the camera becomes an extension of the body for these young  people, most explicitly demonstrated in the self- shot photographs. In addition  to  the  narcissistic  overtones,  the  form  of  these  pictures  is  aimed  at  further  blurring  the  line  between  producer  and  subject,  through  group  photos  in  which  picture- takers  and  picture- posers  dynamically  rotate,  and  audiences  viewing  the  photos  participate  in  photographic  meta- constructions  through  commenting and tagging.   This study suggests some interesting directions for future research. First, it  builds on the literature of personal photography by examining the more public  use  of  personal  photographs  on  SNSs.  Most  of  the  literature  on  personal  photography has focused on how and what people present in the more private  settings of the home. The Internet, as other media have before, blurs the dis- tinction between private and public, thus upsetting conventions of storytelling  and  mnemonic  recollection  via  photography.  Second,  this  piece  expands  on  Internet  studies  of  self- presentation  by  focusing  more  closely  on  the  photo- graphic  representation  people  offer  of  themselves.  Finally,  this  chapter  attempts to place the photographic presentation college students offer in the  context of a larger visual youth culture.   Of  course,  the  sample  studied  is  limited  to  Facebook  photos  and  is  not  meant to be representative of all college students. Still, the consistency of the  photo  types  allows  us  to  draw  conclusions  about  how  college  students  use  photos to speak to each other visually. Future research could attempt to track  the changing nature and uses of these photographic repositories, following a  smaller  sample  of  college  students  as  they  photographically  move  through  college years and beyond. In- depth interviews would help gain understanding  of  the  roles  that  photographs  play  in  these  students’  lives.  These  interviews  also could help differentiate people who post many photos from those who do  not.   Facebook tagged photographs present more than random moments in a per- son’s life. They present a suspended take on college life sociality, through a  collage of scenes celebrating the self, group culture, and membership that are  played out over and over again. The same scenes are repeated in a variety of  photographed  occasions  as  we  find  them  comforting  and  reassuring.  They  provide visual evidence of social networks. Pictures reveal the transition from  high school to college, but they do more than document; they allow photo- graphed subjects to prove or confirm these milestones for each other; they val- idate  the  sense  of  a  real  college  experience.  Facebook  pictures  are  where  college  students  visually  play  out  their  lives  for  each  other,  demonstrating  their identity as college student. These practices serve as performative exer- cises  of  identity  and  belonging,  simultaneously  declaring  and  corroborating  shared experiences.

Chapter 13 Copyright, Fair Use, and Social  Networks  Patricia Aufderheide  Online  social  networks  have  made  visible  what  was  always  true:  the  self  is  endlessly constructed with a constant stream of bits of culture that people use  both  to  shape  experience  and  relationships.  People  communicate  with  each  other  traveling  along  lines  of  taste  and  affection  for  shared  and  shareable  culture. Online social networks facilitate and reinforce the building of one’s  personal social networks, which locate you in the world and to yourself.   Take  Kira’s  twenty- sixth  birthday  party.  Kira  and  her  twenty- something  friends met at a bar in downtown Washington, D.C., to get a list of absurd tasks   jump in a fountain; hug 10 strangers; do a group dance to Michael Jackson’s  “Thriller;” take a picture of the number 26 somewhere . They then headed off in  teams to accomplish those tasks, recorded them faithfully on their cameras and  cell phones, and came back to the bar to recount their achievements and peer  onto  each  other’s  screens.  Then  they  went  home  to  post  their  recordings  on  Facebook, where their friends are now commenting and forwarding to others.  Their online selves were completely integrated with their face- to-face selves.   Meanwhile, Kira’s friend Alison  who won Kira’s scavenger hunt, as you can  find out on her Facebook page  found out about Keyboard Cat—an online video  meme—from  friends  on  Facebook.  Or  maybe  it  was  some  IM  chat,  or  an  email—she doesn’t remember, really. Alison was puzzled at first, but quickly  got the idea. Video of a real cat playing  thanks to an unseen master  the piano  gets inserted into some piece of bad or over- the-top television. For instance, in  “Play Haley Off, Keyboard Cat,” in a segment from the TV show, Walker, Texas  Ranger, a young boy tells Walker’s friends that he knows he has AIDS. Suddenly,  the keyboarding cat video is interpolated. Similarly, a pretty announcer for some  international  TV  program  suddenly  vomits  on  screen—and  there’s  the  key- boarding  cat.  So  every  time  Alison  sees  a  particularly  good  keyboard  cat,  she  posts it on her Facebook page. Now that her friends know the keyboard cat is on  her radar, they’re scouting for her too. Keyboard cat is currency in her social  network.   Copyright, Fair Use, and Social Networks    275    Lauren, a co- worker of Alison’s, has created a kind of contest on her Face- book page, to see who can track down and post particularly silly examples of  1980s culture. It started as part of an 1980s-theme day that swept her social  network. The contest makes Lauren’s Facebook page a destination, and creates  incentives for her friends to scour YouTube for the odd, weird, and out- of- fashion.  One  of  their  favorite  finds—and  sometimes  their  own  creation—is  the  “literal  video  version.”  Finding  an  egregious  music  video,  people  then  rewrite the lyrics, creating new subtitles that literally spell out what is going  on in the video  which is usually narrative nonsense  to the tune of the original  song.  See, for example, “Total Eclipse of the Heart: Literal Video Version.”   When one of her friends finds a delicious example, Lauren will repost that dis- covery on her Facebook page by Hat Tipping, or HTing. The online nature of  this  scavenger  hunt  doesn’t  make  it  any  less  real  than  Kira’s  scavenger  hunt  was. Lauren’s online exchanges reinforce and facilitate her face- to-face social  life.   The friends share not only their own work but professional work that also  comments on and reshapes popular culture. For instance, the Media Matters  for America site depends on Facebook flow to carry its critique of conservative  media forward. Its “Fox News is a 24 7 Political Operation: the Untouchables  Edition” uses clips from Fox News showing grossly biased announcers attempt- ing to besmirch the Obama Administration, with interpolated intertitle com- mentary. The segment is posted on the Media Matters Facebook page, which  Lauren then reposts on her page. Her association of the Media Matters page  with her own network is a way of expressing her own political opinion, and an  invitation to others to repost as well.   It has never been clearer that people, in this way, make new culture with  existing culture, creating new meanings for it that are appropriate to—indeed,  contribute to defining—their own networks. In a study of online video work  incorporating  copyrighted  material,  we  identified  a  wide  range  of  ways  that  people  are  making  new  culture  with  existing  culture   Aufderheide  &  Jaszi,  2008 . Social networking makes it breathtakingly easy to share entire swaths  of popular culture in that process. The 1980s videos, the Fox news excerpts,  the  “Thriller”  music—it’s  all  copyrighted  work.  That  fact  poses  some  new  challenges both to existing copyright holders and to makers of new culture in a  digital era. When is it legally permissible to quote from your culture, which  social network participants do every day?   Such  uses  are  not  going  unchallenged;  indeed,  sometimes  they  are  pun- ished, and punished unjustly. Copyright holders have been ferocious in their  pursuit  of  people  who  reuse  their  copyrighted  work  digitally.  Online  video  sites such as YouTube—the mother lode of the copyrighted material circulat- ing  madly  on  social  networking  sites—are  patrolled  by  content  holders’    276    Convergent Practices  automated identification system  often known simply as “robots” or “bots”  for  what some content companies call “piracy.” The copyright holders issue take- down notices to the services, which then remove the postings within 48 hours.  The  target  of  the  content  companies’  bots  is  posting  of  entire  programs  or  films, but they often hit work by people who, accidentally or on purpose, are  not only reusing but repurposing their work, in an entirely legal way. Remix- ers actually have the right to quote existing copyrighted work without licens- ing it, under the U.S. copyright doctrine of fair use. The posters also have the  right  to  issue  a  counter- takedown  notice  when  their  work  disappears,  but  often,  intimidated  or  ignorant  of  their  rights,  they  do  not.  Indeed,  the  new  makers are often clueless about whether their actions are legal. They do not  know what constitutes fair use in their own practice. They may well not only  be intimidated by actions such as takedowns, but by their own fears and confu- sions. In one of our studies, we found there was a high level of anxiety among  college- age  makers  of  online  video  about  the  risks  of  violating  copyright   Aufderheide & Jaszi, 2007 .   Fair use, which is explained in detail below  p. 279f. , is context- dependent,  and users need to decide in each case whether it’s appropriate to their situations.  They do so on the basis of some general considerations, referred to in the legisla- tion itself. Those terms, however, are so vague that they can be unhelpful. The  law suggests calculating fair use on the basis of the nature of the original material,  the kind of use being made, how much is taken, and the effect on the market.  Each  of  these  categories  is  too  baggy  for  comfort,  especially  in  the  high- stakes  world of copyright infringement. Fortunately, judges take seriously the norms of  specific communities and situations, and so best practice codes have been a prac- tical, effective way to deal with interpretation of fair use  Aufderheide, 2007 .   In  2008,  a  precipitating  event  in  the  world  of  online  video  provoked  the  Center  for  Social  Media  and  the  Washington  College  of  Law’s  Program  on  Information Justice and Intellectual Property to team up and create the Code  of  Best  Practices  in  Fair  Use  for  Online  Video.  Google  had  purchased  YouTube,  the  overwhelmingly  major  site  for  online  video,  and  Viacom,  a  major  media  company,  had  promptly  sued  Google  for  permitting  copyright  infringement. Google and other companies running online video websites have  claimed  they  were  Internet  Service  Providers   ISP —not  curators,  creators,  or programmers of content—and as such were protected from secondary lia- bility for copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  But in this litigation, Viacom charged that YouTube was in fact contributing to  the infringement of Viacom’s material, because it had given people the tools  to infringe and encouraged them to do so.   These  legal  positions  may  be  tested  in  Vicacom’s  lawsuit;  much  more  likely, however, the suit will lead to a private settlement rather than a public    Copyright, Fair Use, and Social Networks    277  resolution. The lawsuit is in limbo, but it is well understood in the industry  that the large media companies ultimately want an environment in which they  do not have to patrol the online video sites and issue takedowns, but rather  can depend on the online video sites to patrol themselves and their customers.  Instead  of  waiting  for  ISPs  to  remove  offending  material,  as  they  do  today,  they would like YouTube to filter the content at the outset. If Google’s past  history in negotiating with stakeholders is any guide, at some point Google  an  industry  trend- setter   will  accommodate  content  holders’  demands  in  some  way. Others in the industry are likely to follow suit.   If online video sites filter with pre- emptive, automated, or semi- automated  detection systems, then fair use is at risk. And, if people cannot exercise fair use,  they  cannot  conduct  the  ordinary  business  of  communication  as  evidenced  in  social networking practices today. The actual and proposed systems filtering do  not discriminate between fair use and infringement, because they are automated,  as the Electronic Frontier Foundation has frequently noted. Indeed, its own pro- posed guidelines  still languishing without industry adoption  recommend human  intervention  to  eliminate  “dolphins”  caught  in  copyright  infringement  “tuna”  trawling   www.eff.org issues ip- and-free- speech fair- use-principles- usergen .  Industry discussions to date have uniformly been pious about developing filtering  techniques  that  honor  fair  use;  consult,  for  example,  the  corporate- created  “Principles for User Generated Content Services”  ugcprinciples.com  . But no  one,  in  2008,  had  done  more  than  pay  lip  service  to  the  idea;  no  one  had  addressed how to define fair use within the online video and social networking  environment. And without some clear understanding of how fair use applies to  online video, it is difficult to think about how to preserve it.   It was thus with a sense of urgency that the legal scholar Peter Jaszi, from the  Washington College of Law, and I worked with a team of experts to craft the  Code  of  Best  Practices  in  Fair  Use  for  Online  Video   reproduced  below,   pp. 279–290, and also at www.centerforsocialmedia.org resources publications  fair_use_in_online_video  . We focused on online video rather than any other  digital expression because it was such a vivid part of all social networking, as well  as being a stand- alone practice. We had created earlier codes of best practices in  fair use with documentary filmmakers’ organizations and with teachers’ organiza- tions. In this case, the practices were so new that there were no representative  organizations  for  the  vidders,  the  remix  and  mashup  artists,  the  political  com- mentators, the social networkers, and the fashion- watchers. So instead of working  with established organizations, we built a blue- ribbon panel composed in part of  leading lawyers with fair use expertise, and in part of scholars with a strong know- ledge  of—and  commitment  to—the  emerging  remix  culture  of  do- it-yourself  makers. They worked over months to craft the document, which promptly went  viral—thanks to enthusiastic bloggers such as Cory Doctorow—on its release.   278    Convergent Practices    One of the most interesting things about the terms of the Code was what  was not in it. The Code did not rely on the distinction between noncommer- cial and commercial work—an obviously unreliable line in a field that is devel- oping  so  quickly.  Rather,  it  emphasized  the  primary  indicator  of  fair  use  identified  by  judges  over  the  last  two  decades:  “transformativeness.”  Many  bloggers,  online  video  creators,  vidders,  and  the  scholars  who  studied  them  feel  strongly  that  they  should  be  permitted  to  do  what  they  like  with  copy- righted material, because they are not making money from it. This approach,  however,  is  not  a  particularly  sturdy  argument  as  business  models  adapt  to  create  commercial  environments   such  as  the  ad- filled  YouTube   for  both  commercial and noncommercial work.   There were no industry criticisms of the Code, other than a non- lawyer’s  disparagement of it on the website of the Copyright Alliance  funded by large  copyright  holders  and  chartered  to  promote  their  interests  in  Washington,  D.C.  blog.copyrightalliance.org 2008 07 the- remix-culture  . Patrick Ross  wrote:  This is a dangerous effort. We at the Copyright Alliance support educa- tion on fair use and have information on our site. But our information is  intentionally broad; we do not want to be in the position of giving legal  advice to specific end- users of copyrighted works. . . . But that is precisely  what  the  best  practices  guide  writers  run  the  risk  of  doing. . . .  What  is  implied suggests a significant expansion of the current established thinking  of fair use, going far beyond legal precedent.  William  Patry,  the  copyright  scholar  who  was  senior  copyright  counsel  at  Google, responded sharply on his blog  williampatry.blogspot.com 2008 07  patrick- ross-and- fair-use.html :  Let’s see what this means: a guy who isn’t a lawyer, much less a copy- right lawyer, thinks it is a dangerous effort for copyright lawyers, edu- cators, and those who deal with real world fair use problems on a daily  basis to address some of the common problems presented, not as legal  advice, but as “best practices.” The safe sex approach, according to Mr.  Ross  is  the  type  of  education  that  Mr.  Patrick’s  group—a  front  for  large  corporate  copyright  owners—gives,  namely  always  ask  permis- sion. . . . I can say, based on my over 25 years of experience with fair  use, over 25 years more than Mr. Ross has, that the site doesn’t “imply”  “a significant expansion of the current established thinking of fair use,  going far beyond legal precedent,” as he states. Mr. Ross’s purpose is  not  to  engage  in  a  constructive  debate  about  specific  examples  and    Copyright, Fair Use, and Social Networks    279  whether those examples are appropriately a fair use, something reason- able  minds  might  disagree  on.  Rather,  his  purpose  is  to  silence  those  who  try  to  provide  responsible,  thoughtful  guidance  to  those  on  the  ground, and ultimately to silence those who dare to suggest there can  be fair use at all.  Patrick  Ross  did  not  respond.  But  Google  did.  Google  funded  the  Stanford  Fair Use Project and the Center for Social Media to make a short film about  the Code. That video, created by Claire Darby, is called “Remix Culture: Fair  Use Is Your Friend,” and is available on YouTube among other sites, including  the Center for Social Media.   Today,  the  vast  majority  of  sound  and  image  material  on  Facebook  and  other social networking sites is third- party, copyrighted work. Much of that  copyrighted work is being reused legally, even if the users do not know that.  But  the  creative  practices  that  enable  the  construction  of  social  networks  online as well as offline are threatened by industry conflicts that have nothing  to do with Kira, Alison, and Lauren, and by a deformed understanding of fair  use and copyright policy generally by users themselves.   The social networking habits that incorporate copyrighted material will  only grow. When YouTube and other online video services pre- emptively  filter  work  that  contains  copyrighted  material,  nearly  every  MySpace  and  Facebook  member  will  immediately  feel  the  effect.  Such  filtering  would  directly  change  and  limit  the  circulation  of  material  that  informs  ordinary  social interaction online  and, inevitably, offline  today. It is imperative for  users of this emerging environment for self- expression and self- formation,  as  well  as  their  teachers,  mentors,  and  allies,  to  understand  the  potential  and the limits of fair use—the major copyright exemption from copyright  ownership. It is imperative that they both exercise and defend their rights  to  employ  fair  use,  as  they  reference,  access,  and  transform  their  own  culture.   Fair use enables the creation of new culture; it is remix culture’s friend.  For that reason, employing, teaching about, and sharing the Code of Best Prac- tices  in  Fair  Use  for  Online  Video  are  acts  in  favor  of  creative  culture  production.

Fair use is the right to use copyrighted  material without permission or payment under some circumstances.   This is a guide to current acceptable practices, drawing on the actual activ- ities of creators, as discussed among other places in the study Recut, Reframe,    Copyright, Fair Use, and Social Networks    281  Recycle: Quoting Copyrighted Material in User- Generated Video  centerforsocialme- dia.org recut  and backed by the judgment of a national panel of experts. It  also draws, by way of analogy, upon the professional judgment and experience  of documentary filmmakers, whose own code of best practices has been recog- nized throughout the film and television businesses  centerforsocialmedia.org  fairuse .  What This Isn’t  This code of best practices does not tell you the limits of fair use rights.   It’s  not  a  guide  to  using  material  people  give  permission  to  use,  such  as  works using Creative Commons licenses  creativecommons.org . Anyone can  use those works the way the owners say that you can.   It’s not a guide to material that is already free to use without considering copy- right. For instance, all federal government works are in the public domain, as are  many older works. In most cases, trademarks are not an issue. For more informa- tion on “free use,” consult the document “Yes, You Can!”  centerforsocialmedia. org files pdf free_use.pdf and www.copyright.cornell.edu public_domain .   It’s not a guide to using material that someone wants to license but cannot  trace  back  to  an  owner—the  so- called  “orphan  works”  problem.  However,  orphan works are also eligible for fair use consideration, according to the prin- ciples detailed below.  How This Document Was Created  A distinguished panel of experts, drawn from cultural scholarship, legal schol- arship, and legal practice, developed this code of best practices, informed by  research  into  current  personal  and  nonprofessional  video  practices   “user-  generated video”  and on fair use. Full identification of panelists is on the back  cover of this document.  Background  Video is increasingly becoming a central part of our everyday landscape of  communication, and it is becoming more visible as people share it on digital  platforms. People make and share videos to tell stories about their personal  lives,  remixing  home  videos  with  popular  music  and  images.  Video  remix  has  become  a  core  component  of  political  discourse,  as  the  video  “George  Bush  Don’t  Like  Black  People”  and  the  “Yes  We  Can”  parodies  demon- strated.  Both  amateur  and  professional  editors  are  creating  new  forms  of  viral  popular  culture,  as  the  “Dramatic  Chipmunk”  meme  and  the    282    Convergent Practices  “Brokeback to the Future” mashup illustrate. The circulation of these videos  is  an  emerging  part  of  the  business  landscape,  as  the  sale  of  YouTube  to  Google demonstrated.   More and more, video creation and sharing depend on the ability to use and  circulate existing copyrighted work. Until now, that fact has been almost irrel- evant in business and law, because broad distribution of nonprofessional video  was relatively rare. Often, people circulated their work within a small group  of family and friends. But digital platforms make work far more public than it  has  ever  been,  and  cultural  habits  and  business  models  are  developing.  As  practices  spread  and  financial  stakes  are  raised,  the  legal  status  of  inserting  copyrighted work into new work will become important for everyone.   It is important for video makers, online service providers, and content pro- viders to understand the legal rights of makers of new culture, as policies and  practices evolve. Only then will efforts to fight copyright “piracy” in the online  environment be able to make necessary space for lawful, value- added uses.   Mashups, remixes, subs, and online parodies are new and refreshing online  phenomena,  but  they  partake  of  an  ancient  tradition:  the  recycling  of  old  culture to make new. In spite of our romantic clichés about the anguished lone  creator,  the  entire  history  of  cultural  production  from  Aeschylus  through  Shakespeare to Clueless has shown that all creators stand, as Isaac Newton  and  so many others  put it, “on the shoulders of giants.”   In fact, the cultural value of copying is so well established that it is written  into the social bargain at the heart of copyright law. The bargain is this: we as  a society give limited property rights to creators, to reward them for produc- ing culture; at the same time, we give other creators the chance to use that  same copyrighted material without permission or payment, in some circum- stances. Without the second half of the bargain, we could all lose important  new cultural work just because one person is arbitrary or greedy.   Copyright law has several features that permit quotations from copyrighted  works  without  permission  or  payment,  under  certain  conditions.  Fair  use  is  the most important of these features. It has been an important part of copy- right law for more than 150 years. Where it applies, fair use is a right, not a  mere privilege. In fact, as the Supreme Court has pointed out, fair use keeps  copyright  from  violating  the  First  Amendment.  As  copyright  protects  more  works for longer periods than ever before, it makes new creation harder. As a  result, fair use is more important today than ever before.   Copyright law does not exactly specify how to apply fair use, and that is to  creators’  advantage.  Creative  needs  and  practices  differ  with  the  field,  with  technology, and with time. Rather than following a specific formula, lawyers  and judges decide whether an unlicensed use of copyrighted material is “fair”  according  to  a  “rule  of  reason.”  This  means  taking  all  the  facts  and    Copyright, Fair Use, and Social Networks    283  circumstances into account to decide if an unlicensed use of copyright material  generates social or cultural benefits that are greater than the costs it imposes  on the copyright owner.   Fair use is flexible; it is not uncertain or unreliable. In fact, for any particu- lar field of critical or creative activity, lawyers and judges consider expecta- tions and practice in assessing what is “fair” within the field. In weighing the  balance at the heart of fair use analysis, judges refer to four types of considera- tions mentioned in the law: the nature of the use, the nature of the work used,  the extent of the use, and its economic effect. This still leaves much room for  interpretation,  especially  since  the  law  is  clear  that  these  are  not  the  only  necessary considerations. In reviewing the history of fair use litigation, we find  that judges return again and again to two key questions:   	 Did	 the	 unlicensed	 use	 “transform”	 the	 material	 taken	 from	 the	 copy- righted work by using it for a different purpose than that of the original,  or did it just repeat the work for the same intent and value as the original?  	 Was	the	material	taken	appropriate	in	kind	and	amount,	considering	the	  nature of the copyrighted work and of the use?  Both questions touch on, among other things, the question of whether the use  will cause excessive economic harm to the copyright owner.   If the answers to these two questions are “yes,” a court is likely to find a use  fair.  Because  that  is  true,  such  a  use  is  unlikely  to  be  challenged  in  the  first  place.   Another  consideration  underlies  and  influences  the  way  in  which  these  questions are analyzed: whether the user acted reasonably and in good faith, in  light  of  general  practice  in  his  or  her  particular  field.  Online  video  makers’  ability to rely on fair use will be enhanced by the Code of Best Practices in Fair  Use that follows. This code of best practices serves as evidence of commonly  held understandings—some drawn from the experience of other creative com- munities   including  documentary  filmmakers   and  supported  by  legal  prece- dents,  and  all  grounded  in  current  practice  of  online  video.  Thus,  the  code  helps to demonstrate the reasonableness of uses that fall within its principles.   Video  makers  can  take  heart  from  other  creator  groups’  reliance  on  fair  use. For instance, historians regularly quote both other historians’ writings and  textual sources; filmmakers and visual artists reinterpret and critique existing  work; scholars illustrate cultural commentary with textual, visual, and musical  examples. Equally important is the example of commercial news media. Fair  use  is  healthy  and  vigorous  in  daily  broadcast  television  news,  where  refer- ences  to  popular  films,  classic  TV  programs,  archival  images,  and  popular  songs are constant and routinely unlicensed.   284    Convergent Practices    Unlike  many  traditional  creator  groups,  nonprofessional  and  personal  video  makers  often  create  and  circulate  their  videos  outside  the  market- place.  Such  works,  especially  if  they  are  circulated  within  a  delimited  network,  do  enjoy  certain  copyright  advantages.  Not  only  are  they  less  likely to attract the attention of rights holders, but if noticed they are more  likely to receive special consideration under the fair use doctrine. That said,  our goal here is to define the widely accepted contours of fair use that apply  with equal force across a range of commercial and noncommercial activities,  without  regard  to  how  video  maker  communities’  markets  may  evolve.  Thus, the principles articulated below are rooted squarely in the concept of  “transformativeness.”   In  fact,  a  transformative  purpose  often  underlies  an  individual  creator’s  investment of substantial time and creative energy in producing a mashup, a  personal video, or other new work. Images and sounds can be building blocks  for new meaning, just as quotations of written texts can be. Emerging cultural  expression  deserves  recognition  for  transformative  value  as  much  as  more  established expression.  Best Practices  This code of practices is organized, for ease of understanding, around common  situations that come up for online video makers. These situations do not, of  course,  exhaust  the  possible  applications  of  fair  use  to  tomorrow’s  media-  making techniques.   But  first,  one  general  comment:  Inevitably,  considerations  of  good  faith  come into play in fair use analysis. One way to show good faith is to provide  credit  or  attribution,  where  possible,  to  the  owners  of  the  material  being  used.  One: Commenting On or Critiquing of Copyrighted Material  Description:  Video  makers  often  take  as  their  raw  material  an  example  of  popular culture, which they comment on in some way. They may add unlikely  subtitles.  They  may  create  a  fan  tribute   positive  commentary   or  ridicule  a  cultural object  negative commentary . They may comment or criticize indi- rectly  by way of parody, for example , as well as directly. They may solicit  critique by others, who provide the commentary or add to it.   Principle: Video makers have the right to use as much of the original work  as they need to in order to put it under some kind of scrutiny. Comment and  critique are at the very core of the fair use doctrine as a safeguard for freedom  of expression. So long as the maker analyzes, comments on, or responds to the    Copyright, Fair Use, and Social Networks    285  work itself, the means may vary. Commentary may be explicit  as might be  achieved, for example, by the addition of narration  or implicit  accomplished  by means of recasting or recontextualizing the original . In the case of negative  commentary, the fact that the critique itself may do economic damage to the  market for the quoted work  as a negative review or a scathing piece of ridi- cule might  is irrelevant.   Limitation: The use should not be so extensive or pervasive that it ceases to  function as critique and becomes, instead, a way of satisfying the audience’s  taste for the thing  or the kind of thing  that is being quoted. In other words,  the  new  use  should  not  become  a  market  substitute  for  the  work   or  other  works like it .  Two: Using Copyrighted Material for Illustration or  Example  Description:  Sometimes  video  makers  quote  copyrighted  material   for  instance, music, video, photographs, animation, text  not in order to comment  upon it, but because it aptly illustrates an argument or a point. For example,  clips from Hollywood films might be used to demonstrate changing American  attitudes toward race; a succession of photos of the same celebrity may repre- sent  the  stages  in  the  star’s  career;  a  news  clip  of  a  politician  speaking  may  reinforce an assertion.   Principle: This sort of quotation generally should be considered fair use and  is  widely  recognized  as  such  in  other  creative  communities.  For  instance,  writers  in  print  media  do  not  hesitate  to  use  illustrative  quotations  of  both  words and images. The possibility that the quotes might entertain and engage  an audience as well as illustrate a video maker’s argument takes nothing away  from  the  fair  use  claim.  Works  of  popular  culture  typically  have  illustrative  power precisely because they are popular. This kind of use is fair when it is  important to the larger purpose of the work but also subordinate to it. It is fair  when  video  makers  are  not  presenting  the  quoted  material  for  its  original  purpose but to harness it for a new one. This kind of use is, thus, creating new  value.   Limitations: To the extent possible and appropriate, illustrative quotations  should  be  drawn  from  a  range  of  different  sources;  and  each  quotation   however many may be employed to create an overall pattern of illustrations   should be no longer than is necessary to achieve the intended effect. Properly  attributing material, whether in the body of the text, in credits, or in associ- ated  material,  will  often  reduce  the  likelihood  of  complaints  or  legal  action  and may bolster a maker’s fair use claim.   286    Convergent Practices  Three: Capturing Copyrighted Material Incidentally or  Accidentally  Description: Video makers often record copyrighted sounds and images when  they are recording sequences in everyday settings. For instance, they may be  filming  a  wedding  dance  where  copyrighted  music  is  playing,  capturing  the  sight of a child learning to walk with a favorite tune playing in the background,  or recording their own thoughts in a bedroom with copyrighted posters on the  walls. Such copyrighted material is an audio- visual found object. In order to  eliminate  this  incidentally  or  accidentally  captured  material,  makers  would  have to avoid, alter, or falsify reality.   Principle: Fair use protects the creative choices of video makers who seek  their material in real life. Where a sound or image has been captured inciden- tally and without pre- arrangement, as part of an unstaged scene, it is permissi- ble to use it, to a reasonable extent, as part of the final version of the video.  Otherwise, one of the fundamental purposes of copyright—to encourage new  creativity—would be betrayed.   Limitation: In order to take advantage of fair use in this context, the video  maker  should  be  sure  that  the  particular  media  content  played  or  displayed  was not requested or directed; that the material is integral to the scene or its  action;  that  the  use  is  not  so  extensive  that  it  calls  attention  to  itself  as  the  primary focus of interest; and that where possible, the material used is prop- erly attributed.  Four: Reproducing, Reposting, or Quoting in Order to  Memorialize, Preserve, or Rescue an Experience, an Event,  or a Cultural Phenomenon  Description: Repurposed copyrighted material is central to this kind of video.  For  instance,  someone  may  record  their  favorite  performance  or  document  their own presence at a rock concert. Someone may post a controversial or  notorious  moment  from  broadcast  television  or  a  public  event   a  Stephen  Colbert  speech,  a  presidential  address,  a  celebrity  blooper .  Someone  may  reproduce portions of a work that has been taken out of circulation, unjustly  in their opinion. Gamers may record their performances.   Principle: Video makers are using new technology to accomplish culturally  positive functions that are widely accepted—or even celebrated—in the analog  information environment. In other media and platforms, creators regularly rec- ollect, describe, catalog, and preserve cultural expression for public memory.  Written memoirs for instance are valued for the specificity and accuracy of their  recollections; collectors of ephemeral material are valued for creating archives    Copyright, Fair Use, and Social Networks    287  for future users. Such memorializing transforms the original in various ways— perhaps by putting the original work in a different context, perhaps by putting it  in juxtaposition with other such works, perhaps by preserving it. This use also  does not impair the legitimate market for the original work.   Limitation:  Fair  use  reaches  its  limits  when  the  entertainment  content  is  reproduced in amounts that are disproportionate to purposes of documenta- tion, or in the case of archiving, when the material is readily available from  authorized sources.  Five: Copying, Reposting, and Recirculating a Work or Part  of a Work for Purposes of Launching a Discussion  Description: Online video contributors often copy and post a work or part of  it because they love or hate it, or find it exemplary of something they love or  hate,  or  see  it  as  the  center  of  an  existing  debate.  They  want  to  share  that  work or portion of a work because they have a connection to it and want to  spur  a  discussion  about  it  based  on  that  connection.  These  works  can  be,  among other things, cultural  Worst Music Video Ever!, a controversial come- dian’s performance , political  a campaign appearance or ad , social or educa- tional   a  public  service  announcement,  a  presentation  on  a  school’s  drug  policy .   Principle: Such uses are at the heart of freedom of expression and demon- strate the importance of fair use to maintain this freedom. When content that  originally was offered to entertain or inform or instruct is offered up with the  distinct  purpose  of  launching  an  online  conversation,  its  use  has  been  trans- formed. When protected works are selectively repurposed in this way, a fun- damental  goal  of  the  copyright  system—to  promote  the  republican  ideal  of  robust social discourse—is served.   Limitations: The purpose of the copying and posting needs to be clear; the  viewer needs to know that the intent of the poster is to spur discussion. The  mere fact that a site permits comments is not enough to indicate intent. The  poster  might  title  a  work  appropriately  so  that  it  encourages  comment,  or  provide context or a spur to discussion with an initial comment on a site, or  seek out a site that encourages commentary.  Six: Quoting in Order to Recombine Elements to Make a  New Work that Depends for its Meaning on  Often  Unlikely  Relationships Between the Elements  Description: Video makers often create new works entirely out of existing  ones, just as in the past artists have made collages and pastiches. Sometimes    288    Convergent Practices  there  is  a  critical  purpose,  sometimes  a  celebratory  one,  sometimes  a  humorous or other motive, in which new makers may easily see their uses as  fair  under  category  one.  Sometimes,  however,  juxtaposition  creates  new  meaning  in  other  ways.  Mashups   the  combining  of  different  materials  to  compose  a  new  work ,  remixes   the  re- editing  of  an  existing  work ,  and  music videos all use this technique of recombining existing material. Other  makers  achieve  similar  effects  by  adding  their  own  new  expression   subti- tles,  images,  dialog,  sound  effects  or  animation,  for  example   to  existing  works.   Principle: This kind of activity is covered by fair use to the extent that the  reuse of copyrighted works creates new meaning by juxtaposition. Combin- ing the speeches by two politicians and a love song, for example, as in “Bush  Blair Endless Love,” changes the meaning of all three pieces of copyrighted  material. Combining the image of an innocent prairie dog and three ominous  chords  from  a  movie  soundtrack,  as  in  “Dramatic  Chipmunk,”  creates  an  ironic  third  meaning  out  of  the  original  materials.  The  recombinant  new  work has a cultural identity of its own and addresses an audience different  from those for which its components were intended.   Limitations:  If  a  work  is  merely  reused  without  significant  change  of  context or meaning, then its reuse goes beyond the limits of fair use. Sim- ilarly,  where  the  juxtaposition  is  a  pretext  to  exploit  the  popularity  or  appeal of the copyrighted work employed, or where the amount of material  used is excessive, fair use should not apply. For example, fair use will not  apply when a copyrighted song is used in its entirety as a sound track for a  newly created video simply because the music evokes a desired mood rather  than  to  change  its  meaning;  when  someone  sings  or  dances  to  recorded  popular  music  without  comment,  thus  using  it  for  its  original  purpose;  or  when newlyweds decorate or embellish a wedding video with favorite songs  simply  because  they  like  those  songs  or  think  they  express  the  emotion  of  the moment.  Conclusion  These  principles  don’t  exhaust  the  possibilities  of  fair  use  for  online  video.  They  merely  address  the  most  common  situations  today.  Inevitably,  online  video  makers  will  find  themselves  in  situations  that  are  hybrids  of  those  described above or will develop new practices. Then, they can be guided by  the  same  basic  values  of  fairness,  proportionality,  and  reasonableness  that  inform  this  code  of  practices.  As  community  practices  develop  and  become  more  public,  the  norms  that  emerge  from  these  practices  will  themselves  provide additional information on what is fair use.   Copyright, Fair Use, and Social Networks    289  Common Fair Use Myths  If I’m not making any money off it, it’s fair use. Noncommercial use is indeed one of  the considerations for fair use, but it is hard to define. If people want to share  their work only with a defined closed- circle group, they are in a favorable legal  position. But beyond that, in the digital online environment, wholesale copying  can be unfair even if no money changes hands. So if work is going public, it is  good to be able to rely on the rationale of transformativeness, which applies fully  even in “commercial” settings. If I’m making any money off it  or trying to , it’s not fair use. Although nonprofit,    personal, or academic uses often have good claims to be considered “fair,” they  are not the only ones. A new work can be commercial—even highly commer- cial—in  intent  and  effect  and  still  invoke  fair  use.  Most  of  the  cases  in  which  courts have found unlicensed uses of copyrighted works to be fair have involved  projects designed to make money, including some that actually have.   Fair use can’t be entertaining. A use is no less likely to qualify as a fair one because  the film in which it occurs is effective in attracting and holding an audience. If a  use otherwise satisfies the principles and limitations described in this code, the  fact that it is entertaining or emotionally engaging should be irrelevant.   If I try to license material, I’ve given up my chance to use fair use. Everyone likes to  avoid conflict and reduce uncertainty, and a maker may choose to seek permis- sions even in situations where they may not be required. Later, a maker still may  decide  to  employ  fair  use.  The  fact  that  a  license  was  requested—or  even  denied—doesn’t  undercut  an  otherwise  valid  fair  use  claim.  If  a  rights  holder  denies a license unreasonably, this actually may strengthen the case for fair use.   I really need a lawyer to make the call on fair use. Fair use is a part of the law that  belongs to everyone. A lawyer usually works for a client by reducing risk; in cop- yright law, that often means counseling purchase of rights for all uses of copy- righted  material.  If  clients  tell  lawyers  that  they  want  to  assert  their  rights   something that has a very low risk, if they understand what their rights are  then  lawyers can recommend appropriate policies; but lawyers need to be told what  their clients want.   And, finally, a special note from the lawyers among us: Be careful not to draw  too  much  from  specific  past  court  cases.  A  good  example  of  one  decision  that  easily  can  be  over- interpreted  is  the  California  District  Court  decision  in  L.A.  Times v. Free Republic, 56 U.S.P.Q.2D  BNA  1862  C.D. Cal. 2000 , which ruled  that a right- wing electronic bulletin board that invited reader comments on main- stream media content was not fair use. This anomalous case predates a Supreme  Court decision  Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 2003  that clearly asserted the  link between fair use and free speech. Furthermore, decisions like Bridgeport Music,  Inc. v. Dimension Films, 410 F.3d 792  6th Cir. 2005 , dealing with infringement    290    Convergent Practices  standards in music sampling, are widely cited for fair use principles when in fact  they do not concern fair use at all. While case law is of essential importance in  establishing legal norms, it is the trend in case law that determines such norms.  The trend in case law about fair use has strongly been in the direction of support- ing transformativeness as a core measure of fair use. This puts the judgment about  fair use back squarely in the hands of the new creators and platform providers,  who must look carefully at how videos repurpose copyrighted works.

On the other  hand, at least part of the functionality of such networks relies on software agents  implementing artificial intelligence techniques—for example, in order to imple- ment  recommendation  systems  for  friends  or  other  entities.  However,  such  agents were not playing actor roles within the network. Recently, the monopoly  of human actors within SNSs has been broken; disembodied or even physically  embodied intelligent software agents are just starting to populate SNSs. A huge  range  of  potentialities  exists  regarding  useful  roles  for  such  artificial  agents,  which might furthermore have varying degrees of autonomy. In this chapter, I  will start by introducing a concrete example of such an agent: Sarah the FaceBot,  a robotically embodied intelligent artificial agent, which carries out natural lan- guage interactions with people, physically present or remote, and which utilizes  and publishes social information on Facebook—even having her own automati- cally updated page. Then, five areas of open questions that have arisen will be  presented, as well as an exposition of the potentialities for other artificial agents  in SNSs, either in actor or in other roles, which are promising to unleash new  possibilities and beneficially transform social networks.  Sarah the FaceBot  Sarah  Mavridis et al., 2009a; Mavridis, Kazmi, & Toulis, 2009c  is a physical  mobile  robot  with  Face  Recognition,  natural  language  dialogue,  as  well  as  navigation mapping capabilities  Figure 14.1 . Furthermore, it is a robot that is  also equipped with an interaction database  keeping information about previous  interaction episodes  as well as a social database  keeping personal info as well as  friendship  relations  for  the  people  the  robot  knows .  Most  importantly,  the    292    Convergent Practices  robot also has a live connection to the Facebook social network site—and uti- lizes online information toward crafting dialogues with humans, as well as pub- lishing information on its own Facebook page. Sarah has three kinds of human  friends: those that she has met physically, but which are not her friends on Face- book  P , those that she has met physically, and which are also friends with her  on Facebook  PF  , and those that she has not  yet  met physically, but which are  friends  with  her  on  Facebook   F  .  Interaction  with  human  friends  can  happen  over a number of channels: real- time natural language dialogue with physically  present  friends,  real- time  dialogue  over  chat  for  friends  which  are  currently  online on Facebook, as well as offline Facebook messaging and posting.   A transcript of a typical interaction with Sarah follows:    Greetings Recognition: R:  Hello! My name is Sarah. Welcome to the interactive robots and media   laboratory.  R:  Hi! Are you Panos Toulis?  from Face Recognition . h:    Yes  Robot changes its online status to “interacting with Panos Toulis” .  Figure 14.1   Our   robot,  Sarah   the  FaceBot,  while  interacting  with a human.   Artificial Agents Entering Social Networks    293    Query of overall state: R:  Hey, Panos Toulis, are you doing well today? h:  Yes, pretty well.   General news- based discussion: R:  Let me tell you some interesting news that I’ve heard. R:  The latest windows release will be available to everyone after a surge in  demand crashed the Microsoft website on the 9th of January  item taken  from BBC news online .  R:  Have you heard about this? hR:  Yes. R:  That’s great!   Robot discusses Facebook status of human: R:  I see you are chasing robots in the desert.   Robot gives news about a mutual friend, acquired through Facebook: R:  Did you know that our friend Shervin Emami has posted a new photo on   Facebook?  information acquired from Facebook minifeed .  h:  No.   Robot sends reminder to human: R:    Robot remembers past encounter with mutual friend: R:   I am sending you a message about this to check it out.  I  saw  Shervin  yesterday  evening  and  he  was  doing  well.   information  acquired from interaction database .    Robot gives news about a mutual friend, acquired through Facebook: R:  Did you know that our friend Chandan is “waiting for Sarah to have that  little sweet conversation with me”?  information acquired through Chan- dan’s Facebook status .  h:  Yes, of course.   Robot connects an online friend with the human: R:  One of our friends, Nikolaos Mavridis, is online—would you like me to   send him a message?  h:  Yes  “Nikolaos, Panos says hello” is sent .   End of interaction: R:  Hey, Panos, it was nice talking to you! I have to go now. See you later!  Robot continues wandering . Thus, currently Sarah is capable of producing dialogue turns for:  D1. Recognition Greeting. D2. Querying the state of the human. D3. Relaying customized general news. D4. Relaying Facebook minifeed- based news about human or common friends. D5. Relaying previous interaction- based memories about human or common friends.   D6.  Performing  a  real- time  connection  with  a  third  common  friend  which  is   294    Convergent Practices  online.  D7. Saying goodbye.  It is worth noting that all of these turns contribute toward real- time informa- tion  diffusion  within  the  social  net;  and,  apart  from  these,  Sarah’s  updated  Facebook page contents as well as messages also diffuse information, but in a  non- real-time manner.2    Sarah was originally created in order to test an interesting hypothesis in the  field  of  HRI   Human–Computer  Interaction ,  which  was  formulated  in  Mavridis et al.  2009a : “Can reference to shared memories and shared friends in  human–robot dialogue create more meaningful and sustainable relationships?”   Motivation  for  positing  this  question  was  provided  by  disappointing  early  results on long- term human–robot interaction experiments, as exemplified by  Mitsunaga et al.  2006 —although robots seem to be exciting and interesting  to humans at first, upon multiple encounters quite quickly humans lose inter- est. Thus, the following chain of argument led to the postulated hypothesis:  Let  us  examine  random  human  encounters,  without  explicit  purpose  of  interaction—say,  short  chat  with  a  colleague  or  friend.  What  is  their  content?  First,  there  seems  to  be  continuity  in  these  dialogic  episodes,  connecting the current with the previous encounters; a common, shared  past  is  being  created,  and  reference  to  it  is  often  made  in  the  dialogue.  Second, this common past is not exclusive to the two partners conversing  at  the  moment;  it  actually  extends  to  their  circle  of  mutual  acquaint- ances—and  thus  news  and  memories  regarding  shared  friends  are  often  being mentioned. Thus, let us try to create a conversational robot that can  refer to shared memories and shared friends in its dialogues; and examine  whether this will lead to better long- term human–robot relationships.    Upon closer examination, and in AI terminology, in a sense Sarah is a form  of a chatterbot; and there exists a long line of such systems in the literature,  starting with the classic ELIZA  Weizenbaum, 1966 . But there are a number  of important differences between FaceBots and classic chatterbots; not only is  Sarah physically embodied, but most importantly her dialogues are driven by a  rich  context  of  previous  interactions  as  well  as  social  information,  acquired  physically or online, and which is dynamic and conversational- partner specific.   Two further comments are worth making: first, regarding “shared” entities;  and  second,  regarding  implicit  teleology.  The  primary  hypothesis  that  Face- Bots were created for, is concerned with two postulated “shared” entities and  their  effect  on  human–robot  relationships:  shared  past  and  shared  friends.    Artificial Agents Entering Social Networks    295  Both of these belong to a wider set of shared entities that might prove to be  important: shared interests, shared goals—actually often quite correlated with  shared past and shared friends, at least in certain contexts for certain subsets.  All of these shared entities can be hypothetically unified under the “intersec- tion” I A t ,B t   of the two actors  human and robot in our case , at a given  time  instant  t—a  time- varying  concept.  It  might  well  be  that  the  creation,  maintenance, and synergistic co- evolution3 of such an intersection turns out to  be a crucial factor toward long- term human–robot relationships.   Before proceeding to five areas of open questions that have arisen from this  project,  a  short  note  on  teleology:  the  casual  conversations  that  Sarah  is  attempting to replicate seem not have an explicit purpose from the conversa- tional  partner’s  point  of  view.  However,  their  teleology  is  probably  better  localized not at the personal or the dialogic- partners level—but at the social  network level. The establishment of an adequate intersection enabling under- standing and co- reference, the flow of local- context relevant information, and  the resulting bonding might well be three main components—ultimately tied  to collective social capital.4   Five Areas of Open Questions  Apart from the original motivation behind the creation of Sarah the FaceBot,  this line of research opened up a number of interesting avenues as well as ques- tions related to artificial agents and social networks:   Q1.  Interaction  patterns  of  agent:  What  will  be  the  interaction  patterns  of  such agents with physically present or remote humans? For example, what will  be the frequency, duration, and content of such interactions?   In practice, for artificial agents within social networks, this would amount to  logging and analyzing the different types of interaction events that will occur— synchronous  or  asynchronous,  mutually  visible  or  unidirectionally  visible:  viewing a profile or photo, sending a message, chatting, adding a friend, etc. For  agents that also have a physical embodiment, such as Sarah the FaceBot, prox- emics, gaze, and other such external measurements might also be utilized.   Q2. Friendship graph of agent: What will be the form and temporal dynamics  of  the  friendship  graph  of  such  agents?   a  snapshot  of  Sarah’s  graph  can  be  found in Figure 14.2 . What will the connectivity patterns, tie strengths, as  well as the individual social capital  Coleman, 1988  be?5   One might expect significant differences with human actors in this respect;6  for  example,  the  sustainable  social  circle  size  of  technologically  unassisted  humans is constrained by cognitive limitations—which seem to be somewhat  relaxed in the case of artificial agents. On the other hand, one should also note  that  there  also  exist  important  limitations  of  the  current  state  of  agents  as    296    Convergent Practices  Figure 14.2   The  “touchgraph”  depiction  of  the  first-level  friends  of  the  robot  in  March  2009,  before  public  opening  of  friendships:  79  first-level  friends,  13,989 second-level friends.  compared to humans  for example, in unconstrained natural language dialogic  capabilities .   Q3. Effect of introduction of agents in social network: How will the interaction  and structural patterns of the existing social network be affected by the intro- duction of such agents? Will connectivity patterns be disrupted? Will the evo- lutionary dynamics or node distributions change?7 How will collective social  capital  Putnam, 1993  be affected? How about diffusion patterns? Here, we  move from the ego- centric viewpoint of the agent toward the collective view- point of the network, which is where human actors belong—and which is ulti- mately the locus of importance.   Q4. Relation of agents with multimedia content of SNSs: How will the image or  video content of SNSs be altered through such agents? For example, what is  their potential in posting photos and videos, and or recognizing faces, objects,  places,  and  events  in  posted  photos  and  videos,  on  the  basis  of  their  own  observations or other pre- tagged photos?   Artificial Agents Entering Social Networks    297    Given  that  human  actors  do  not  live  in  a  symbolic language- only  world,  and they populate SNSs with multimedia content, it is important for artificial  agents  to  be  able  to  handle  and or  contribute  such  content.  On  the  other  hand,  again  given  the  different  domains  and  activities  on  which  the  current  state  of  agents  is  more  capable  as  compared  to  humans,  and  vice  versa,  this  also creates an opportunity for overall benefit.   Q5. Social engineering potential of such agents for SNSs: How will such agents  be designed positioned in order to affect connectivity patterns, diffusion pat- terns, social capital, and other such important parameters at will? How will  one exploit the different capabilities of artificial agents for such a purpose?8   From a practical point of view, this is the most important question—and  we will return to some aspects of this in the last section of this chapter.   Currently, some very early answers to aspects of Q1 and Q2 for the case of  Sarah have been reported in Mavridis et al.  2009c , together with an exten- sive discussion of the synergies between SNSs, interactive robotics, and face  recognition.  Furthermore,  the  use  of  live  photos  in  conjunction  with  online  photos  toward  better  face  recognition,  as  well  as  algorithms  utilizing  social  context toward better and or faster recognition through such agents, is dis- cussed and algorithms are given in Mavridis, Kazmi, Toulis, & Ben- AbdelKader   2009b .  Also,  simple  algorithms  for  empirically  estimating  the  social  graph  given only photos containing co- occurring faces are presented.   Of course, this is just a very early stage regarding the questions and avenues  listed above—and much more work remains to be done in order to reach a  more mature stage. Also, one can pose the above questions  Q1–Q5  not only  in  their  predictive  form   “What  will  be?” ,  but  also  in  their  potential  form   “What could be?” , their normative form  “What should would one want to  be?” ,  and  their  engineering  form   “How  should  we  act  in  order  to  reach  . . .?” . Thus, we can, for example, ask not only: how will social capital change  with  the  introduction  of  artificial  agents?  But  also:  how  could  it  change?  As  well as: how would one want it to change? And also: what action plan should  be followed so that the introduction of artificial agents within social networks  changes social capital toward the desired direction?  The Physical vs. Online and Symbolic vs.  Sensory Realms  Expanding upon Q4, another interesting observation regarding embodied arti- ficial  agents  in  actor  roles  arises:  such  artificial  actors,  as  human  actors  do,  belong to an actual social network, a subset of which is re- represented within  Facebook.  Also,  as  mentioned  before,  they  have  three  categories  of  friends:  physical only  P , physical who are on Facebook  PF  , and Facebook only  F  .    298    Convergent Practices  Their perceived identity thus depends on different primary sources for each of  the three categories of friends  physical presentation vs. online ; and the effect  of differences and misalignments across these can thus be studied.   Yet one more observation is concerned with the relationship of the linguis- tic symbolic with the sensory realms for such agents. Both realms are accessi- ble physically as well as online; although different projections selections of the  two realms exist in the two. For example, consider photos; these belong to  the sensory realm—and the robot has access to snapshots from its own camera   physically , as well as to Facebook- posted photos  online . For example, con- sider  the  friendship  relationship  between  two  individuals;  say,  George  and  Jack.  This  linguistic symbolic  information  might  be  available  through  the  online friendship graph on Facebook, or might be acquired by direct indirect  questioning, through the robot’s dialogue system. On the other hand, this lin- guistic symbolic piece of information is not uncorrelated to the sensory realm;  as a simple statistical analysis can show  see Mavridis et al., 2009b , we expect  that “The face of X appears in photos together with the face of Y”  a sensory-  realm  relation   is  a  strong  predictor  for  “X  is  a  friend  of  Y”   a  linguistic  symbolic- realm relation . In essence, this is yet one more instance of symbol  grounding   Harnad,  1990 —which  is  normally  performed  by  human  actors,  and  which  in  this  case  could  potentially  be  transferred  over  to  the  artificial  actors   Mavridis,  2007 .  Thus,  a  quartet  of  vertices  arises:  sensory physical   capturing a photo through the robot’s camera , linguistic- symbolic physical   hearing that X is a friend of Y , linguistic- symbolic online  reading that X is a  friend of Y from Facebook , sensory online  seeing a photo on Facebook , and  the bidirectional connections among these vertices are to be resolved by the  actors involved.   Now, having seen a brief introduction to FaceBots as an example of a robot- ically embodied artificial agent in an actor role within the Facebook SNS, let us  move on toward a wider perspective: a basic taxonomy and an exposition of  the  potentialities  for  other  artificial  agents  in  SNSs   either  as  an  actor  or  in  other roles  will be presented, followed by a discussion of their possible effects  toward beneficially transforming human social networks.  The Space of Potentialities for Artificial Agents  The space of potentialities for artificial agents within social networks is quite  vast, and a number of basic degrees of freedom dimensions  D  will be intro- duced here.   D1. One first obvious choice is concerned with the Appearance of the Agent  to the human actors of the network; one possibility for the agent is to have an  active  Actor  role  within  the  SNS,  with  a  profile,  a  friendship  network,  and    Artificial Agents Entering Social Networks    299  interactions—such as the case of Sarah—and either for it to be declared as an  artificial  entity  or  to  posit  itself  as  a  human  actor.  Another  is  for  it  not  to  appear as a human actor, but as a distinct entity  for example, an installable  Facebook application  or as part of the architecture of the SNS itself  as is the  case  of  the  friend  recommendation  system  of  Facebook .  Yet  another,  quite  interesting, possibility is for its existence to be unknown to the human actors;  where the agent can be acting by effectively modulating what might appear as  random events; for example, the order of presentation of items within a list,  pushing forward and thus emphasizing some items in order to increase their  availability in the human’s mind.   D2. One other degree of freedom is concerned with the Physicality of the  agent. One can have, for example, a physically embodied agent; a virtual char- acter with a cartoon- like body; or a totally disembodied entity. Of course, this  degree does not only cover form, but also movement and body dynamics of  the agent.   D3.  Yet  one  other  interesting  dimension  is  Autonomy;  the  artificial  agent  might be completely autonomous, or exhibiting adjustable autonomy through  human  assistance  at  specific  times  or  in  certain  levels  of  abstraction.  Such  a  configuration  sometimes  combines  the  best  of  both  worlds   artificial  and  human ,  and  enables  successful  application  of  agents  to  areas  where  their  current state of the art would not allow them to be applied alone. Some recent  examples of adjustable and sliding autonomy in the agents and robotics literat- ure are Schurr, Marecki, Tambe, Lewis, and Kasinadhuni  2005  and Sellner,  Heger, Hiatt, Simmons, and Singh  2006 —and analogous guiding principles  can be followed in creating effective man–machine hybrid agents participating  in SNSs.   D4. In the case of an agent in an actor role, another important dimension is  that  of  the  apparent  perceived  Identity  of  the  agent;  the  profile  information,  linguistic style, dialogue system, posted pictures, friendship circles, as well as  interaction behaviors of the agent, all contribute to this. As noted, the agent is  performing his or her identity in two stages: the physical and the online stage.  Simple  software  tools  for  crafting  artificial  actor  identities  have  not  yet  appeared; although one would envision that with appropriate machine learning  techniques,  information  mined  from  the  profiles,  dialogues,  and  the  other  traces of the actor’s performed identity would enable the creation of congru- ent identities for artificial actors, parametrized by a set of simple user choices.  For example, one could envision the possibility of learning simplistic mappings  from regional- socio-economic background  part of profile information  to lin- guistic  style   mined  from  dialogues ,  for  a  limited  dialogic  range,  and  vice  versa,  and  thus  using  these  mappings  in  order  to  minimize  authoring  time  when crafting the identities of new artificial actors.   300    Convergent Practices    D5.  Finally,  and  quite  importantly,  there  is  the  question  of  the  overall  Purpose of the agent. This will be considered in more detail in the next section.  Possible Purposes for Artificial Agents  Let us start with an observation: moving on from actor- role to non- actor-role  agents, one of the crucial differences is concerned with their scope of visibil- ity; usually, an actor- role agent can only have direct access to the resources  opened to him or her via the adjusted security settings of the other agents that  have chosen to connect on the network. In contrast, an overt non- actor agent,  for example a Facebook application, often gets wider access to all data of the  actors that have installed it; and even more so, an overt- or covert- non-actor  agent  that  is  part  of  the  SNS  itself,  for  example  the  friend  recommendation  system of Facebook, can have omniscient access to all actors within the SNS as  well as their interactions. After this comment regarding the difference in scope  of  visibility  between  actor-  and  non- actor-role  agents,  let  us  move  back  to  some  possible  choices  for  the  purpose  of  artificial  agents  within  social  networks.   The  purpose  of  the  example  agent  presented  above,  Sarah  the  FaceBot  robot,  is  to  create  sustainable  relationships  with  humans—which  could  be  translated into a metric containing components related to frequency and dura- tion of interaction over a longer period, human satisfaction, as well as number  of  friends,  for  example.  Another  possible  purpose  for  actor- role  agents  is  teaching education, specialist assistance, as well as multiple forms of persua- sion  Fogg, 2002 .   Also,  artificial  agents  in  actor  roles  can  be  quite  beneficial  for  setting  up  experiments in order to test scientific hypothesis related to social networks— for example, questions regarding diffusion—as they are, in a sense, limited but  perfectly reliable puppets. As long as their divergence from human behavior is  not detrimental for the purpose of the experiment, they can be used to create  predictable responses and gather measurements within the social network: for  example, when studying diffusion, agents can act as pre- programmed filters or  targeted redistribution nodes; or when acquiring friendship request acceptance  prediction models, agents can be set up with the desired apparent identities and  initial messaging response patterns, and gather results regarding the acceptance  of their requests by various actors. The interchange between human actor and  artificial  actor  for  social  network  research  is  quite  parallel  to  human robot  interchange when bi- directionally informing Human–Robot Interaction  HRI   by Human–Human Interaction  studies and vice versa, for example  Mutlu et  al.,  2009 ;  and  as  long  as  the  nature  of  the  experiment  can  benefit  from  the  “limited but perfectly reliable puppet” constraint.   Artificial Agents Entering Social Networks    301    Another  possible  purpose  for  actor- role  agents  is  to  intervene  within  the  information  flow  of  the  network—toward  a  number  of  potential  goals:  re-  spreading  news,  monitoring  for  possible  mutations,  even  counter- spreading  information, or creating parallel flows and adjusting existing two- step flow of  communication nets and influencers  Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955 . Another pos- sible  goal  is  the  active  acquisition  of  information:  actor- role  agents  could  potentially activate their own connections on demand, in order to seek, ask  for, and relay back missing information.   One  further  possible  purpose  is  restructuring  the  connectivity  of  the  network, through suitable overt or covert recommendations; this might take  place towards a variety of goals, for example related to useful matchmaking of  actors toward personal or professional goals, which could be beneficial to the  network or a sub- network as a whole—perhaps in terms of social capital. For  example, an agent might try to actively detect and manipulate structural holes.  Due to the benefits of a possible wider scope of visibility and non- interactivity  in this case, non- actor agents are more suitable for this purpose.   Another  primary  role  for  non- actor  agents  is  supervising policing  the  network  in  order  to  detect  possible  criminal  or  otherwise  harmful illegal  activity.  Currently,  there  exist,  for  example,  automated-  or  human- assisted  picture censorship services within SNSs; but there exist many more areas that  could  potentially  benefit  from  the  appropriate  form  of  supervision,  given  of  course appropriate privacy and freedom concerns.   Finally,  let  us  close  this  brief  exposition  of  some  possible  purposes  for  agents  within  social  networks  with  a  relevant  comment:  when  arbitrating  visibility action scope across a number of agents, often hierarchical structures  are quite beneficial, sometimes augmented with hierarchy- breaking patches. A  recent  example  of  a  hierarchical  multi- agent  cognitive  architecture  is,  for  example, EM- 1  Singh, 2006 , where the idea of higher- order agents having  access to the internals of lower- order agents and acting as “mental critics” is  central.9  One  could  thus  envision  similar  hierarchies  of  visibility  and  action  scope within hybrid multi- human artificial agent systems operating on SNSs.  Conclusion  In this chapter we have discussed the entry of Artificial Agents, in embodied or  disembodied forms, within human social networks. We started by introducing  a concrete example of such an agent: Sarah the FaceBot, a robotically embod- ied intelligent artificial agent, which carries out natural language interactions  with  people,  physically  present  or  remote,  and  which  utilizes  and  publishes  social information on Facebook—and which publishes on her own automati- cally updated page. Then, there was a brief presentation of five areas of open    302    Convergent Practices  questions that have arisen, a short discussion on relevant aspects of the quartet  created by the physical online and symbolic sensory realms, and an exposition  of the potentialities and purposes for such agents; either in actor or in other  roles. In conclusion, artificial agents, which are currently increasingly populat- ing  social  networks,  are  promising  to  significantly  change  these  networked  publics in a beneficial manner, and unleash numerous new possibilities.  Notes  1.  Before the introduction and wider spread of SNSs, the primary means of online  self- presentation  were  homepages,  which  while  changeable,  were  not  dynamic   Papacharissi, 2002 .  2.  Currently, and mainly due to speech recognition constraints, Sarah is mainly dif- fusing information acquired through online news, Facebook minifeed and status,  and interactions; but there is not much direct acquisition of information from the  human, except from a basic state query and “did you know x” queries. This is an  active direction for extensions.  3.  This  co- evolution  often  indirectly  relies  on  input  from  personal  evolution  and  interaction with other entities inside or outside the shared circle of friends; such  interactions  might  lead  to  the  growth  of  the  personal  non- shared  component  of  each actor, which in turn leads to novel input for co- shaping the intersection.  4.  For  an  interesting  and  somewhat  complementary  evolutionary  view,  including  a  theory postulating the transformation of primate grooming into gossip, see Dunbar   1996 .  5.  For a concise introduction to the basic social network analysis  SNA  terms used   here, one could look at the opening chapters of Marlow  2005 .  6.  Ultimately, after a number of layers, reducing to some of the differences between  atoms  and  bits,  in  sense  of  Negreponte   1995 ,  or  at  least  to  the  differences  between biological atoms and the current state of agents comprised by bits.  7.  For example, the well- established power law distributions arising from the model  of Barabasi  2002 , depend on preferential attachment processes—which, for the  sake of experimentation at least, artificial agents might not chose to follow—and  linear growth of the net.  8.  For example, the much larger interaction memory as well as social info storage of  such agents, or the possibility of having distributed embodiments spanning large  geographical distances, are two basic differences.  9.  Such models are arguably quite reminiscent to implementations of the structures   of a platonic republic, at least in some respects.  References  Publishing.  Barabasi,  A.  L.   2002 .

Conclusion A Networked Self  Zizi Papacharissi  Attention shapes the self, and is in turn shaped by it.   Csikszentmihalyi, Flow, p. 13   The Self in Convergent Architectures  The  self,  in  late  modern  societies,  is  expressed  as  fluid  abstraction,  reified  through the individual’s association with a reality that may be equally flexible.  The  process  of  self-presentation  becomes  an  ever- evolving  cycle  through  which  individual  identity  is  presented,  compared,  adjusted,  or  defended  against  a  constellation  of  social,  cultural,  economic,  or  political  realities.  Goffman  1959  described this as an information game: “a potentially infinite  cycle  of  concealment,  discovery,  false  revelation,  and  rediscovery”   p.  13 .  This somewhat ego- centered approach has been related by other sociologists  to contemporary historical developments, which render the self more liquid   Baumann, 2000; 2005 , reflexive  Giddens, 1991 , or self- identity a process   Jenkins, 2004 . Self- identity in public and private life thus traverses distinct  yet connected planes of interaction or networks. Technology may provide the  stage for this interaction, linking the individual, separately or simultaneously,  with  multiple  audiences.  Online  social  networks  constitute  such  sites  of  self  presentation and identity negotiation. A Networked Self introduced an anthology  of  discussions  on  what  it  means  to  present  the  self  in  online  networked  environments.   Social  network  sites  enable  individuals  to  construct  a  member  profile,  connect  to  known  and  potential  friends,  and  view  other  members’  connec- tions.  Their  appeal  derives  from  providing  a  stage  for  self-presentation  and  social connection. SNSs provide props that facilitate self-presentation, includ- ing text, photographs, and other multimedia capabilities, but the performance  is centered around public displays of social connections or friends, which are    A Networked Self    305  used  to  authenticate  identity  and  introduce  the  self  through  the  reflexive  process of fluid association with social circles. Thus, individual and collective  identities are simultaneously presented and promoted. Online social networks  like MySpace, Facebook, Cyworld, Orkut, LinkedIn, and Bebo reinforce the  social affordances of online environments, by fostering interaction that is pri- marily interpersonal, and founded upon norms of everyday interaction adapted  to the online setting. Enabling both identity expression and community build- ing, SNSs are initially structured around a niche audience, although they fre- quently expand beyond that target market. SNSs cater to a variety of cultural  and social interests, and vary to the extent that they support additional services  such as blogging  e.g., LiveJournal , audio visual content sharing  Flickr, Last. FM,  YouTube ,  professional  orientation   LinkedIn ,  focus  on  status  updates  online  and  mobile  connectivity   Twitter,  Dodgeball ,  exclusive  membership   ASmallWorld , or specific ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, and or par- ticular content genres  Orkut, CyWorld .   The architecture of the technology that belies these networked platforms of  interaction  rests  upon  principles  of  convergence,  which  enable  multiple  and  overlapping connections between varieties of distinct social spheres. The social  platforms  or  spaces  sustained  by  convergent  technologies  accentuate  conflu- ence, flexibility, and reflexivity of media content. Jenkins  2006  has broadly  defined  convergence  as  “a  word  that  describes  technological,  industrial,  cul- tural and social changes in the ways media circulates within our culture . . . a  situation  in  which  multiple  media  systems  coexist  and  where  media  content  flows fluidly across them”  p. 282 . Jenkins emphasizes that convergence ref- erences  several  common  ideas,  including  the  flow  of  content  across  media  platforms, overlap between media industries, financing that serves the interest  of combined processes of media production, migratory behavior on the part of  audiences that virally follow content, and of course, the ability for audiences  to  interact  with  content  as  both  consumers  and  producers.  The  convergent  properties  of  media  render  them  both  remixed  and  remixable;  the  product  of  institutions and independent socio- cultural agents. It is helpful to understand  social network platforms as hosting social resources that are both remixed and  remixable,  in  the  sense  that  they  actively  combine  all  aspects  of  our  social  identity  into  a  singular  sphere,  which  then  further  evolves  as  these  distinct  parts converge and evolve.   Needless to say, convergence as a property is neither exclusive to nor defin- ing of all communication technology. While characterized by a confluence of  information communication services and platforms, convergence of technolo- gies  brings  forth  and  is  sustained  by  a  convergence  of  practices  within  and beyond technology, thus also proposing a convergence of spaces and prac- tices.  To  this  point,  Deuze   2007   suggests  that  convergence  “is  not  just  a    306    Conclusion  technological process,” and must therefore also be recognized as “having a cul- tural logic of its own, blurring the lines between production and consumption,  between making media and using media, and between active or passive specta- torship  of  mediated  culture”   p.  74 .  The  confluent  properties  of  information  technologies  suggest  particular  possibilities  for  interaction,  which  tend  to  be  structured around the potential for interaction to converge social spheres, remix  social  resources,  and  reorganize  the  time  and  space  contours  of  sociability.  It  would be sensible to characterize these properties as the affordances of conver- gent  technological  architecture,  that  is,  intrinsic  potentialities  of  technologies  that make them “easier to use them for some purposes than for others”  Bucking- ham,  2008,  p.  12 .  Open  to  re- appropriation  by  individuals,  affordances  are  negotiated  and  re- deployed,  characterizing  technology  that  is  both  “socially  shaped and socially shaping”  Buckingham, 2008, p. 12; Williams, 1974 .   The individual combines the affordances of both older and newer media to  construct a social sphere that lends autonomy and fluidity to the way in which  sociality is managed. A model of networked sociality emerges on online spaces,  the  architectural  affordances  of  which  inform  human  activity,  by  suggesting  possibilities  for  interaction.  Working  in  ways  similar  to  the  architecture  of  physical  spaces,  these  affordances  “organize  an  ensemble  of  possibilities  and  interdictions,” which are then left to the individual to actualize or reappropriate   de Certeau, 1984, p. 98 . The architectural environment presented through  these affordances places the individual as the center and source of all interac- tions, which typically emanate from a locus that permits an online connection.  Frequently this locus is domestic, although workplace and mobile connections  introduce  elements  of  flexibility  and  ubiquity  to  the  sociability  sustained  via  social network sites. The common element, however, among all these access  points is that they command a private sphere of interaction, meaning that the  individual engages socially through a private media environment located within  the individual’s personal and private space. This private sphere of social inter- action is rhetorically established by the individual by utilizing existing and imag- ined  geographies  of  place.  Social  activities  may  be  pursued,  then,  through  private domestic environments or via temporary moments of privacy attained  at  the  workplace,  via  mobile  access,  or  in  other  public  environments.  These  privée  spaces  are  socially  enabled  via  networked  technologies,  and  social  network sites afford this form of networked, mobile, and flexible sociality.  Private Spheres of Sociality and Multiplied  Audiences  Private spheres of sociality are sustained through SNS member profiles, net- works  of  friends,  and  communicative  capabilities  different  SNSs  offer.  It  is    A Networked Self    307  within  this  architectural  plateau  that  the  networked  self  is  actualized,  taking  advantage of the expressive and connective affordances of SNSs. Online social  networks allow the individual to connect to local and remote spheres of family  members, friends and acquaintances, and strong and weaker social ties. They  further expand the communicative channels individuals may dedicate toward  the cultivation of social networks. The flexibility of online digital technologies  permits interaction and relations among individuals within the same networks  or  across  networks,  a  variety  of  exchanges  and  ties,  variable  frequency  of  contact  and  intimacy,  affiliation  with  smaller  or  larger,  and  global  or  local,  networks formed around variable common matter. The individual gains access  to a variety of multimedia tools that enable the possibility for more controlled  and  more  imaginative  performances  of  identity  online.  Users  create  a  “face”  for  each  interaction  and  develop  “faces”  for  a  variety  of  situational  contexts   Goffman, 1959 . These performances are enabled by a performative palette  that combines multimedia elements with cultural references, elements of play,  denotative and connotative expression, and a variety of tools. Goffman  1959   describes this performative palette as the “setting,” for the presentation of the  self; that is, the “furniture, décor, physical layout and other background items  which supply the scenery and stage props,” with which the individuals articu- late the “front,” or a general introductory performance of the self, as opposed  to the “backstage,” where a more authentic self resides  p. 97 . SNSs expand  the  expressive  equipment  at  hand,  possibly  allowing  greater  control  of  the  dis- tance between the front and backstage areas of the self; what is presented and  that which is reserved.   The process of self-presentation is complicated in the context of SNSs that  combine a variety of audiences, of variable privacy or publicity, into a single  crowd  of  spectators  observing  the  same  performance,  but  from  a  variety  of  vantage  points,  depending  on  their  relationship  to  the  performing  self.  The  individual  must  then  engage  in  multiple  mini  performances  that  combine  a  variety of semiological references so as to produce a presentation of the self  that makes sense to multiple audiences, without sacrificing coherence and con- tinuity. The process of modifying behavior so as to be palatable to a variety of  audiences  is  not  new  for  individuals.  In  everyday  cycles  of  self- presentation  and  impression  formation,  individuals  perform  on  multiple  stages,  and  in  doing so, they blend social spheres online that may have been separate offline,  thus  confusing  private  and  public  boundaries.  Meyrowitz   1986   describes  these  circumstances  as  subtle  changes  in  the  “situational  geography  of  social  life,” and argues that electronic media frequently reorganize private and public  boundaries in ways that expose individuals to a variety of potential audiences,  some intentional and several accidental  p. 6 . The architectural equivalent of  lifting all walls physically separating rooms, houses, offices, buildings, and all    308    Conclusion  concrete structures, this rearrangement of boundaries results in a loss of the  unique connection of interaction to place, or in Meyrowitz’s terms, the loss of  a sense of place. Social interactions taking place on SNSs could be interpreted as  suffering from a similar lack of private public boundary delineation, and con- sequently, a sense of place.   While it is possible for this convergence to displace the situational character  of  some  communication,  non- verbal  and  verbal  cues  afforded  by  technology  enable  the  mediation  of  situational  information.  Following  the  initial,  and  rather dramatic, collapse of place described by Meyrowitz, individuals become  familiar with a multiplication of place, which emphasizes the propagation over  the  consolidation  of  audiences.  Scannell   1996   has  referred  to  the  same  process  as  a  “doubling  of  place,”  explaining  that  in  late  modern  life,  “public  events . . . occur simultaneously in two different places: the place of the event  itself and that in which it is watched and heard. Broadcasting mediates between  these  two  sites”   p.  76 .  With  converged  technologies,  the  effect  is  further  multiplied,  creating  a  plurality  of  overlapping  or  mutually  exclusive  social  audiences, which suggests that the “doubling” or “multiplying” metaphor may  be a more accurate reflection of the role played by technology  e.g., Couldry,  2000;  Couldry  and  McCarthy,  2004;  Moores,  2004;  Ross,  2004;  Scannell,  1996 . Consequently, social relationships are multiplied, creating the potential  for multiple performances of the self occurring on a variety of different stages   Moores, 2004 . This multiplication of social audiences does not imply a lost  sense of place, but it does necessitate performances that are more aware, so as  to  make  sense  to  a  variety  of  audiences.  These  performances  are  crafted  in  fragments  of  polysemic  pertinence,  which  are  interconnected  by  the  SNS  member profile. The resulting space is a converged continuum of sociality that  is  “homogeneous,  yet  at  the  same  time  broken  into  fragments”   Lefebvre,  1991, p. 342 .  Knowns and Unknowns  Given  that  identity  is  performed  to  multiplied  audiences,  via  multiple  tools  and on multiple stages, what are the consequences of these polysemous per- formances  for  sociality?  The  growing  popularity  of  social  network  sites  fre- quently  leads  scholars,  the  media,  and  the  public  to  ask  what  sorts  of  individuals  these  networks  produce:  More  or  less  social?  Research  typically  reveals that, following an initial phase during which avid use of a new medium  displaces  other  habits,  individuals  return  to  their  everyday  routines,  which  now include a healthier integration of the new medium. Therefore, for most  people, new media contribute to, rather than permanently dislodge, social and  other routines. As a result, individual spheres of sociality are not necessarily    A Networked Self    309  enhanced or restricted, but they are reformed. Important as it may be to con- sider the impact of the technology on social behaviors, a binary focus on effects  invites  metric  tendencies  that  are  inherently  misguiding.  More  meaningful  questions  lie  in  determining  not  sheer  amount  or  presence  of  sociality  but,  rather, the patterns of sociality that emerge. Similarly,  the  growing  relevance  of  social  network  sites  invites  questions    regarding the social character of these platforms, leading us to ask: Are these  tendencies reflective of more or less social media? By definition, communica- tion  media  connect   and  disconnect ,  thus  inherently  possessing  social  attributes. Decades of social science research on communication technologies  have shown that media do not render people more or less social; they connect  and, in doing so, afford all situations they mediate social properties. All media  are social. Without question, media will foster some form of social connec- tion;  more  interesting  questions  lie  in  investigating  who  they  connect,  who  they disconnect, and how.   Finally, popular interest in social network sites revolves around the extent  to which these present more or less social spaces. Given the ability of people  to populate space with activity that is social, via media that intrinsically permit  connection, more interesting questions involve what makes a space social; why  some activities are present in certain social spaces and absent from others; and  how properties of space inform the ways in which we perform our sociality.   These are the questions on the minds of the researchers contributing to this  anthology,  as  they  approach  social  network  sites  as  spaces  where  sociality  is  exercised, reformed, or borne out of. The focus of this volume rested on the  construct  of  the  self,  and  what  happens  to  self- identity  when  it  is  presented  through networks of social connections in converged mediated environments.  The volume was structured around the core themes of identity, community,  and culture, as these are iterated on social network sites. Identity, community,  and culture present primary organizing points for most researchers interested  in new media. Rather than organize the volume around these core themes, I  chose to let these themes inform and rematerialize in the text of the chapters.  Each contribution to this volume evokes these three themes in various ways,  and in doing so, permits this collection to both address and move beyond these  abstractions.   Albert- László Barabási keynoted the volume, and the day- long conference  that accompanied this volume, hosted by the Department of Communication  at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in May of 2009. Using the logic of net- works, Barabási examined laws and mechanisms that underlie communication  in all types of networks, whether those are sustained by the Internet, biologi- cal  systems,  or  social  actors  and  their  communities.  Expressing  attributes  inherent  of  human  behavior  and  human  organisms,  networks  communicate    310    Conclusion  relationships between a variety of intertwined nodes of variable strength and  weight. The unique characteristics of these nodes and their shared connections  afford each network its fundamental set of laws and systemic organization, that  is, its underlying architecture. It is the sociality emerging via this networked  architecture that the contributors to this volume pursued with their research.   The  organizational  logic  of  networks  was  integrated  with  the  context  of  communication theory in the first three chapters of the volume, so as to assess  the  communicative  potential  of  social  network  sites.  Walther,  Carr,  Choi,  DeAndrea,  Kim,  Tong,  and  Van  Der  Heide  connected  the  study  of  social  network  sites  to  the  theoretical  legacy  of  decades  of  mass  and  interpersonal  communication  research.  The  question  they  asked  involved  the  extent  to  which converged platforms of social interaction, like social networks, necessi- tate new analytical concepts or can be appreciated via the application of exist- ing theoretical approaches. While technologies of convergence build upon the  personal, interpersonal, and mass communicative potential of past media, they  also reorganize social conventions, leading to subsequent convergence of social  spaces and practices. Walther et al. proposed a new perspective, founded on  the merger of various communication theories applied to the liquid social land- scapes proposed by newer media technologies. To this end, Walther et al. sug- gested  an  analytical  emphasis  that  recognizes,  first,  the  proximity  and  simultaneity  converged  interfaces  advance  via  a  multiplicity  of  sources,  and  second, the wide range of interpersonal imperatives pursued through purpo- sive, and frequently combined, use of a variety of communication channels.   Such  a  remediation  of  media  theory  would  help  interpret  the  utility  of  newer technologies that have refashioned previous media as much as they have  themselves  been  fashioned  by  the  trajectories  of  media  past.  This  re-  organization of media theory would require a contemporary operationalization  of  terms  that  have  defined  empirically  driven  research  on  traditional  media,  including the audience, the public, and audience activity and involvement. It  would also require a theoretical apparatus that allows us to examine what con- cepts like identity, community, and culture, which have inspired a majority of  new  media  studies,  mean  on  networked  places  that  prioritize  personal  connections.   Converged  platforms  of  social  interaction  reorganize  our  conventional  understandings  of  time  and  space  in  ways  that  afford  opportunities  to  fulfill  personal needs for communication. Walther et al. recommended that we focus  our  analytical  efforts  on  these  needs,  by  re- adjusting  our  theoretical  canons  and enriching them with contemporary language. danah boyd took this cue and  interpreted social network sites as a genre of networked publics. Within this  framework,  the  affordances  provided  by  the  architectures  of  networked  publics shape and are shaped by the dynamics of networked interactions, in the    A Networked Self    311  same  way  that  the  physicality  of  offline  spaces  informs  and  responds  to  the  social  predispositions  of  individuals.  boyd  perceives  the  affordances  of  net- worked publics as being shaped by an architecture of bits, and identifies pro- files,  friend  lists,  and  tools  for  public  communication  as  central  structural  components of networked platforms that may shape the interactions of publics  that act socially within them. These architectural components, along with the  structural affordances of persistence, replicability, scalability, and searchabil- ity,  create  singular  multimedia  networked  stages,  upon  which  identities  and  relationships are performed.   The  architectural  affordances  of  SNSs  present  a  compelling  theoretical  backdrop,  upon  which  the  utility,  consequences,  and  everyday  ecology  of  media habits, including online social networking, may be explored. It is the  formation of the everyday ecology of media routines that LaRose, Kim, and  Peng  were  interested  in,  as  they  explored  the  normalcy  with  which  newer  media  habits  are  integrated  with  standing  everyday  routines.  Examining  the  pathology of this integration, LaRose et al. asked whether social network use  may become compulsive, problematic, or addictive. Resting on recent theo- retical developments and employing empirical data, they suggested that most  cases  of  intensive  social  networking  present  instances  where  users  willingly  yield an amount of self-regulation so as to indulge a favorite media pastime.  Despite popular press accounts of “Facebook addiction,” use of SNSs appears  to be no more problematic than other media habits. Moreover, not all types of  Internet  use  are  associated  with  the  same  types  of  consequences,  suggesting  that the effects of certain types of Internet use may offset the effects of more  dysphoric uses. This would imply that, rather than isolating the effects of SNS  use, it is essential that we examine and contextualize them within the greater  spectrum of an individual’s media and interpersonal habits and routines.   And  yet  it  is  important  to  consider  the  affordances  of  SNSs  for  interper- sonal  interaction  without  neglecting  how  the  economies  of  SNSs  engage  the  individual as commodity and networked laborer. Andrejevic suggested that the  networked sociabilities facilitated by SNSs are structured upon a separation of  the user from the means of socializing, thus permitting “storable and sortable”  collections of social data. These data, produced and shared by the networked  users, breathe life into the network, which accumulates social and economic  capital as data become richer and more complex. Not only may these data be  used to design marketing campaigns, customize applications, and lend further  value  to  third- party-run  groups  and  applications,  but  they  also  form  the  content  backbone  of  the  network,  without  which  the  value  of  the  network  would diminish. Thus, the social resources of individual members present the  basis of the content production process, in which uncompensated individuals  contribute  personal  information  and  additional  social  labor  toward  the    312    Conclusion  accumulation  of  collectively  generated  networks  of  sociability.  These  social  resources  are  further  reconfigured  and  returned  to  the  users  in  the  form  of  customized marketing efforts, which colonize these domains of personal self- presentation  and  sociality  of  personalized  commercial  narratives.  Andrejevic  suggested  that  SNSs  need  not  follow  the  commercial  model  of  social  labor  exploitation, and that the specific peer- to-peer affordances of the network, in  fact, steer away from these avaricious scenarios. The structural affordances of  a  capitalist  economy,  however,  do  tend  to  limit  non- commercially  sensitive  deployments of socially networked platforms.   Andrejevic  concluded  that  these  commercially  guided  interpretations  of  interactivity and sociability further limit our understanding of community. It is  this possibly compromised sense of identity that Parks became interested in, in  the  next  group  of  chapters  considering  textures  and  patterns  of  sociability  emerging on SNSs. Recognizing that community presents an influential meta- phor  for  understanding  the  social  textures  of  the  Internet,  Parks  questioned  whether  SNSs  could  be  perceived  as  virtual  communities.  In  doing  so,  he  examined MySpace and the social affordances the network provides in terms  of  membership,  personal  expression,  and  connection.  While  virtual  com- munities  were  relatively  rare  on  MySpace,  personal  and  social  connections  were abundant, frequently between individuals living in close proximity.   This  would  suggest  a  more  personalized  expression  of  sociability,  that  develops  sans  community  aspirations  to  satisfy  individualistically  determined  social  needs.  Parks  suggested  that  users  approach  a  network  like  MySpace  looking  not  for  community,  but  for  “theater,”  or  an  experience  of  the  mass  communication variety, or what others have termed “micro- celebrity”  Senft,  2008 .  Motivated  by  what  Parks  termed  an  “inflated  sense  of  agency,”  these  users  approach  the  medium  hoping  to  expand  their  networks  and  ties.  Fre- quently, however, they must rely on mostly local networks to sustain online  connections,  thus  reflecting  a  confluence,  rather  than  separation  of  social  behaviors.   For  researchers,  social  behaviors  that  traverse  and  frequently  converge  a  variety  of  behavioral  and  performative  platforms  suggest  that  we  become  equally  convergent  in  our  application  of  theory,  combining  approaches  to  understand users that are equally multi- purposive in their social orientations.  Ellison, Lampe, Steinfield, and Vitak, through a growing body of work, found  evidence of a variety of connection strategies employed by college- age Face- book users to sustain social ties of varying breadth and depth. Utilizing schol- arship on social capital and interaction patterns, Ellison et al. found that the  technical  and  social  affordances  of  Facebook  permitted  users  to  manage  broader  and  more  diverse  networks  and  interactions.  Moving  further  away  from  the  traditional  approach  of  measuring  the  social  value  of  online    A Networked Self    313  interaction against the metaphor of community, Ellison et al. proposed a more  flexible model of relationship management enabled by SNSs, fostering larger  sets of weaker ties, the ability to render ephemeral connections persistent, and  more  convenient  means  of  cultivating  social  relations  with  strong  and  weak  ties.   Hargittai and Hsieh further investigated differences between individual uses  of  SNSs,  by  employing  data  to  construct  a  typology  of  social  network  site  usage.  Non- random  differences  in  the  intensity  and  diversity  of  engagement  with  SNSs  reflected  the  presence  of  particular  types  of  use,  which  could  be  associated  with  user  attributes  and  possibly  consequences  of  SNS  use.  Inter- preted  together,  these  differences  indicated  that  those  with  more  Internet  experiences  and  abilities  were  more  likely  to  be  more  engaged  with  SNSs.  While  the  data  did  not  reflect  causal  patterns,  the  implications  here  are  important in terms of access and literacy privileges that influence the intensity  and texture of online behaviors, and the reverse, that is, heightened Internet  savvy that possibly develops out of more intense use. Media involvement has  always been an important, yet elusive, antecedent and consequence of media  use.  Understanding  the  levels  of  involvement  with  a  variety  of  SNSs  is  an  important step in describing and analyzing their place in the greater spectrum  of an individual’s media and interpersonal habits.   Within an organizational setting, SNSs may facilitate enhanced presentation  of  professional  and  personal  identities,  as  well  as  support  communication  within  and  across  organizations.  Watson- Manheim  advanced  the  concept  of  “communication repertoire” as a way of organizing and analyzing the variety of  opportunities different communication channels afford to workplace commu- nication. Communication repertoires are developed in response to organiza- tional priorities as well as external social factors, but customized by employees  to  support  individual  social  and  professional  routines.  The  extent  to  which  communication media repertoires, including SNSs, may be retrofitted by indi- viduals  depends  on  the  degree  of  flexibility  both  the  institution  and  the  medium afford. Watson- Manheim saw the adoption of SNSs in the workplace  as primarily a grass- roots effort, facilitated in most organizations via the com- municative  routines  of  employees,  rather  than  formally  espoused.  The  blur- ring of private and public boundaries that SNSs thrive on present a complicated  social landscape for companies and their employees, who must reconcile and  navigate personal and professional aspects of their identity in order to sustain  communication  that  does  not  compromise  either  their  professional  or  their  personal project  and performed  profile.   And  yet,  intuitive  appropriations  drive  the  uses  and  capital  generated  by  SNSs,  as  users  frequently  converge  and  customize  attributes  to  construct  personalized  social  spheres.  Johnson,  Zhang,  Bichard,  and  Seltzer  examined    314    Conclusion  specific genres of SNS interaction to understand the relevance of online social  networks  for  political  communication.  Examining  a  national  online  panel  of  over  500  Internet  users,  Johnson  et  al.  compared  SNSs  and  YouTube  as  sources of political information to find that reliance on SNSs proved to be a  more accurate predictor of political attitudes and behavior. Even though the  demographic  and  political  profiles  of  the  two  platforms  of  services  were  similar, individuals utilized YouTube to obtain political information, but tested  out  their  political  attitudes  and  behaviors  on  the  interactive  spaces  of  SNSs.  The  connective  and  interactive  affordances  of  SNSs  allowed  individuals  to  pursue  civic  behaviors  both  offline  and  online.  While  neither  YouTube  nor  SNS  use  predicted  the  likelihood  of  voting,  study  results  indicated  that  the  more users watched YouTube, the less likely they were to vote, thus reflecting  possible frustration or growing cynicism with the number of divergent mes- sages present on YouTube.   In  a  similar  vein,  Kaye  compared  communication  sustained  by  SNSs  and  blogging  networks.  Following  an  initial  cluster  analysis  that  identified  four  groups  of  users,  Dabblers   those  who  do  not  heavily  use  SNSs  or  blogs  for  political information , Social Networkers  those who heavily use only SNSs ,  Ambi- textrous  those who heavily use SNSs and blogs , and Blogophiles  those  who  heavily  use  only  blogs ,  Kaye  compared  social  networkers  and  blogophiles, to isolate differences between the two platforms. She found that  Social Networkers tended to be young, female Democrats, while Blogophiles  tended to be older, male Republicans. Social Networkers were also higher in  trust, lower in self- efficacy, less interested and knowledgeable about politics  and less knowledgeable about the 2008 election than Blogophiles. Social Net- workers  enjoyed  comparing  political  ideas  and  attitudes  with  those  of  like-  minded  individuals  within  their  networks,  whereas  Blogophiles  were  motivated to use blogs for non- mainstream political information for depth and  analysis.  These  results  indicated  that  SNSs  could  support  the  affirmation  of  political  attitudes  and  behaviors,  where  more  information- driven  platforms,  like blogs and YouTube, provide the fodder for the development of these atti- tudes.  Future  research  could  investigate  these  relationships  further,  as  they  certainly reflect connections between user orientation, type of use, and con- sequences, also underlined by Ellison et al. and Hargittai and Hsieh earlier in  this volume.   Gilpin further explored the variety of uses individuals put specific genres of  SNS to, by focusing on the affordances of Twitter for public relations profes- sionals. Examining how twitter feeds influence the information and attitudinal  scope  of  public  relations  practitioners,  Gilpin  analyzed  some  of  the  most  prominent  feeds  to  find  that  this  form  of  micro- blogging  primarily  fulfilled  needs  of  information  sharing,  networking,  and  professional  affirmation.    A Networked Self    315  Beyond  this  initial  plane  of  converged  information,  social,  and  professional  needs,  Twitter  permitted  the  more  fluid  management  of  offline  and  online  spheres  of  interaction  for  professionals,  thus  forwarding  a  newer  model  for  self- organized  PR,  structured  around  the  self  and  the  greater  professional  interests of the individual. Thus, Twitter emerged as both an impression man- agement  and  network  management  tool,  which  could  be  manipulated  and  readjusted to fit the personal and professional imperatives of individual users.   Impression  management  and  network  management  were  of  interest  to  Mendelson and Papacharissi, who examined this from the different scope of  college student photo galleries displayed on Facebook. Looking at the photo- graph as both a mnemonic and symbolic device, they were interested in the  role of photographs in visual performances of the self enacted on SNSs. They  found that photographs tagged on Facebook tended to reinforce group mem- bership  and  cohesion.  In- group  language,  references,  and  inside  jokes  sur- rounding  photographs  symbolically  connected  a  private  sphere  of  friends  within  the  publicly  private  realm  of  Facebook.  Most  photographs  exhibited  narcissistic tendencies, overt displays of affection, and playful behaviors pro- duced exclusively for the camera. These collective exhibitions of friendship  emanated from the ego- centered member profile and advertised collectively  shared  experiences  to  the  world,  inviting  both  intentional  and  accidental  onlookers to a “look- at-us” taste of what college life might be like. Directly  performative, these visual presentations supported the theater of personal and  collective  identity,  as  played  out  through  the  rituals  of  the  college  experience.   As identities are increasingly performed and managed online, via an archi- tecture that combines bits and cultural references, ownership of the rights to  the  privacy  and  publicity  of  these  performances  becomes  important.  For  Aufderheide, the pressing issue is that of copyright, as these self-performances  frequently remix cultural content in order to effectively communicate medi- ated identities. It is on the basis of these shared and remixed cultural perform- ances that individual SNS users express themselves and connect with others.  Fair use and copyright are central issues, given the opportunities to reappro- priate cultural content and create new, privately public, and publicly private  meaning that SNSs afford.   What is interesting for us, as researchers, is copyright protection and fair  use of remixed and performed identities, as these become visible to a variety  of  audiences  that  individuals  feel  more  or  less  comfortable  with.  If  indeed  identity presented online becomes a performance, to what extent can that per- formance be protected, or exploited, in the manner that other cultural per- formances are repurposed and traded within the greater cultural marketplace?  Can  an  individual  protect  an  identity  performance  by  copyright,  thus    316    Conclusion  preventing  a  current  or  potential  employer,  or  other  undesirable  viewers,  from accessing it, or using it as a measure of the individual’s entire identity?   This question attains greater complexity as SNSs are increasingly populated  by  more  actors,  of  both  human  and  software  origin.  Beyond  the  embedded  presence  of  software  agents  responsible  for  the  functionality  and  appeal  of  these networks, SNSs also afford the integration of disembodied or physically  embodied intelligent software agents, who may employ a variety of actor roles  within  online  social  networks.  Mavridis  presented  one  concrete  example  of  such an agent: Sarah the FaceBot, a robotically embodied intelligent artificial  agent,  who  recognizes,  converses,  and  remembers  Facebook  friends,  and  employs this information to update her own member page and sustain long-  term communication with other network actors. Thus, not only does identity  performance contain remixed and remixable properties, but it becomes pos- sible to construct identities entirely out of remixed and remixable interaction.   The common thread between all these chapters is woven around emerging  patterns of networked sociality. These patterns combine old and newer social  habits,  reform  and  remediate  several  social  routines  of  the  past,  and  reflect  social  tendencies  and  tensions  that  take  shape  on  networked  planes  of  social  activity. The first set of chapters situated these tendencies and tensions in theo- retical context, and proposed re- worked theoretical frames through which we  may interpret them. Within these frames, central themes revolve around  a   the  ability  of  networked  and  converged  social  platforms  to  serve  personal  needs for social connection,  b  the possibility of networked publics coalescing  around  the  networked  architectures  of  SNSs,   c   the  ways  in  which  these  newer habits are combined and integrated with older ones, and  d  the manner  in which modes of economic and organizational hierarchy influence the auton- omy of individuals employing these networks as social agents.  Sociality, Sociabilities, and A Networked Self  A  reasonable  next  cognitive  step  develops  as  we  consider  the  shape  of  this  emerging and networked sociability, and how sociality is formed out of dis- tinct sociabilities embedded and borne out of SNSs as social platforms. Even  though the terms “sociality” and “sociability” are synonymous, sociality refers  to the sum of social behaviors that permit the individual to traverse from the  state  of  individuality  to  that  of  sociality  and  fellowship.  Sociability,  on  the  other hand, refers to the ability to perform the social behaviors that lead to  sociality,  and  thus,  reflects  one’s  inherent  potential  to  engage  in  such  social  behaviors. The second set of chapters, then, considers the ways in which we  employ the affordances of SNSs to attain sociability, and the extent to which  the emerging tendencies and tensions of networked sociability enable a shared    A Networked Self    317  sense of sociality. Recognizing that community is not the only means of practic- ing sociability and attaining sociality, these chapters examine how autonomous,  yet connected, agents interact offline and online, from the domestic and work-  related,  public  and  private,  spheres.  The  emerging  sociability  moves  beyond  community,  recognizes  identity  as  performance,  and  defines  as  culture  a  con- verged set of practices that are social, political, economic, personal, and work-  related,  as  long  as  they  contain  a  semiology  that  affords  connection.  What  emerges, then, is a networked self, socially enabled by the affordances of SNSs.   A networked self, communicated across collapsed and multiplied audiences,  seeks social opportunities for expression and connection. These opportunities  take a variety of forms, organically generated by relatively autonomous social  agents pursuing social goals reified via the affordances of SNSs. A broad range  of  examples  of  networked  sociability  are  visited  in  the  last  set  of  chapters,  ranging from behaviors that connect social actors as citizens, teenagers as col- lective  narcissists,  remixed  content  to  remixed  identity,  and,  finally,  human  social agents to networked non- human social actors. What is clear is that socia- bility no longer stands for what it used to be. Human actors have been condi- tioned to recognize physically active and extroverted behaviors as social; in the  networked  context  of  sociability,  we  observe  varieties  of  behaviors  that  are  unquestionably social, yet also practiced from variably passive states of engage- ment or via the more introspective exercise of narcissistic photography or self-  expression.   So- called social media enhance a particular type of sociability—networked  sociability.  And  they  contain  affordances  that  permit  persons  to  maintain  the  individuality of their private sphere as they traverse to sociality. Networked and  remixed sociabilities emerge and are practiced over multiplied place and audi- ences, that do not necessarily collapse one’s sense of place, but afford sense of  place reflexively. A sense of place is formed in response to the particular sense  of self, or in response to the identity performance constructed upon that place.  This presents the modus operandi for the networked self, and the context of  newer patterns of sociability and routes to sociality that emerge. The ability for  individuals to efficiently avail themselves of the potential of SNSs depends on  the individual level of access, literacy, and general comfort with socially net- worked platforms of interaction. Adept navigation of the social landscapes of  SNSs implies that identity is performed, but is also edited across multiplied and  converged audiences. It requires some mastery of the expressive equipment at  hand, or the ability to maneuver in what Castells  2001  termed, the “technical  geography”  of  SNSs.  The  ability  to  edit,  or  redact,  one’s  own,  multiple  self-  performances may afford a sense of place, even if temporarily so, for the indi- vidual.  And  thus,  redactional  acumen  becomes  a  survival  skill,  as  individuals  exercise, become comfortable with, and play with a networked sense of self.   318    Conclusion  References  Bauman, Z.  2000 .
