Hundreds of thousands of programs have been written for MS-DOS.  Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition represents Que Corporation’s continuing commitment to provide the best computer books in the industry. Over the years, this book has evolved as DOS has evolved, culminating in what you are reading right now. Keeping pace with technology and explaining it clearly, simply, and completely has been Que’s goal. This book, which is a comprehensive learning tool and reference volume for users of  MS-DOS, reﬂects the maturity of DOS and the far-reaching impact that DOS has had on the computing industry. Even the most popular operating system today, Windows 95 98 ME, is still based on an upgraded version of DOS.  Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition offers DOS users a comprehensive source of information that can help them organize their work with the PC more effectively and make their hardware respond more efﬁciently.  Who Should Read This Book?  This book is written and organized to meet the needs of a large group of readers. It is  suited for readers who have a basic familiarity with DOS but need more information to increase their knowledge and sharpen their skills. Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition is also a comprehensive reference on DOS for the more advanced user.  Maybe you have just learned to use your PC and are looking to move beyond the basics. Perhaps you have upgraded your hardware to a more powerful PC, with more memory and disk capacity. Or maybe you have upgraded your version of DOS and want to take advan- tage of its new or expanded features. If you ﬁnd that you ﬁt into any of these categories, this comprehensive edition is a “must have” volume.  What Hardware Do You Need?  This book applies to the family of personal computers with Intel x86-based processors. There are literally thousands of manufacturers today making PCs, too numerous to list here. MS-DOS will run on virtually any model available today, although you might encounter problems locating drivers for newer hardware components, such as sound and network cards.  What Versions Are Covered?  We have discovered that the vast majority of readers are using MS-DOS version 6.x. This book is focused on DOS version 6.22, although limited information is available for those using an older DOS version.  The best advice we can offer is that you upgrade your system. If you are using a version of DOS older than 6.0, upgrade right away; you will ﬁnd it well worth the time and effort.  Throughout this book, speciﬁc versions of DOS are indicated.   How Is This Book Organized?  3  When a particular reference applies to both DOS 6.0 and 6.22, however, the more generic DOS 6 designation is used.  What Is Not Covered?  This book does not include the DEBUG or LINK commands, nor does it include a technical reference to the applications programming interface that DOS provides for programmers.  For information on how to install or upgrade your version of DOS, you should refer to a separate book—your MS-DOS manual. Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition assumes that you already have DOS installed and are using it.  Also not included in this book are computer-speciﬁc setup or conﬁguration commands. Although these commands often are distributed with the same disks as DOS, they are too variable to be covered adequately here. Your computer-supplied manual and your PC dealer are the best sources of information about these machine-speciﬁc features.  How Is This Book Organized?  You can ﬂip quickly through this book to get a feeling for its organization. Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition approaches DOS in a logical, functionally deﬁned way. The material in this book is arranged in four main parts and a set of appendixes that include a Command Reference, and a glossary.  Part I: DOS Fundamentals  Part I, “DOS Fundamentals,” is devoted to explaining the fundamental role of DOS in a working PC:    Chapter 1, “DOS and the Personal Computer,” looks at today’s PCs. The chapter  explores the major components of the PC and addresses the use of system and periph- eral hardware. In this chapter, you get a feel not only for your system but also for sys- tems with different keyboards, displays, and peripherals. You also learn the role of DOS in relation to your system.    Chapter 2, “Starting DOS,” steps through the process of booting DOS and explains  important concepts along the way. You also learn how you can control the booting process through setting up multiple conﬁgurations.    Chapter 3, “Using DOS Commands,” introduces and explains how to use DOS com- mands. You learn the concepts behind issuing commands at the DOS command line. The chapter explains syntax, parameters, and switches in an easy-to-learn fashion. Important keys and various examples of the DOS command are also covered, along with information on how to access the DOS built-in help system.   4  Introduction    Chapter 4, “Using the DOS Shell,” gets you up and running with the DOS Shell. This chapter explores the DOS Shell screen and discusses aspects of the Shell common to all its commands.  Part II: Files and Directories  Part II, “Files and Directories,” covers everything you need to know about the heart of DOS—working with disks and the ﬁles stored on them:    Chapter 5, “Understanding Files and Directories,” recognizes the important job DOS  performs in managing your ﬁles. This chapter deﬁnes ﬁles and clearly explains ﬁle- naming conventions. Also explored is the tree-structured directory system used by DOS to organize your ﬁles. You learn how to use commands that create, change, remove, and display directories.    Chapter 6, “Understanding Disks and Disk Drives,” provides the framework you need  to better understand how DOS stores information on your disk. You discover what disks are, how information is recorded on them, and some of the technological issues related to disks. Additionally, you explore the use of DoubleSpace, the DOS program that enables you to virtually double the amount of information you can store on your disk drives.    Chapter 7, “Preparing and Maintaining Disks,” builds on the information presented in Chapter 6. Here, you learn what formatting does and how DOS uses formatted disks to store your ﬁles. This chapter describes SMARTDrive, a disk cache that increases the speed with which you can access data on your hard disk, and Microsoft Defrag, a utility that keeps your ﬁles in proper order. You also learn how to partition a hard disk into sections that DOS can use as logical disks. Also presented are two DOS commands, CHKDSK and SCANDISK, that analyze disks for damage.    Chapter 8, “Managing Your Files,” is devoted to managing your ﬁles and illuminating the ﬁle-level DOS commands. Here, you learn how to examine directory listings, view the contents of ﬁles, and use the INTERLNK program to transfer ﬁles between a laptop and your desktop computer. Because you probably spend most of your time with DOS working with ﬁles, this chapter also offers an in-depth view of the ﬁle-level commands. Each command includes examples that help you appreciate the full power of these important commands.    Chapter 9, “Protecting and Recovering Your Data,” covers the important issues  involved with safeguarding the most important part of your computer system—your computer data. You learn common-sense solutions to data protection, as well as how to use the backup programs supplied with DOS. This chapter also discusses how you can recover from catastrophic errors or events. You learn how to undelete ﬁles, unformat a drive, and recover data on your hard disk. When you ﬁnd yourself in a situation that requires this information, you’ll probably agree that this chapter alone is worth the price of this book. Finally, this chapter also discusses computer viruses and how to pro- tect your computer against them.   How Is This Book Organized?  5  Part III: Controlling DOS  Part III, “Controlling DOS,” covers the DOS commands and concepts that enable you to change how DOS does its work. The information covered in Part III lets you use DOS effectively to reﬂect the way you do your work:    Chapter 10, “Working with System Information,” covers the commands that set and  retrieve system information in your DOS-based computer. These commands often are neglected, but they key you into the control panel of DOS. These commands are help- ful whether you oversee one PC or help other users with their PCs.    Chapter 11, “Controlling Your Environment,” discusses how you can set system vari- ables and change the DOS prompt. You also learn how you can use the MODE command to change how DOS displays information on your screen, as well as how you can use DOS to change your disk drive conﬁguration.    Chapter 12, “Using Peripherals,” explains device drivers and covers what you need to know to correctly install them. You learn how to set hardware interrupts and what the difference is between hardware and software interrupts.    Chapter 13, “Controlling Devices,” explains the DOS commands that control the  behavior of logical DOS devices. By using these commands, you can control the way DOS sees your system’s drives and directories. You learn how to use your printer while doing other computer work, and you see how to use the DOS pipes and ﬁlters effec- tively.    Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS,” steps you through  the complicated, but sometimes necessary, conﬁguration of a PC to various internation- al language standards.  Part IV: Maximizing DOS  Part IV, “Maximizing DOS,” provides the information you need to tap the expanded power available with DOS. This part of the book helps you use the many features provided with DOS and helps you customize your computer system:    Chapter 15, “Using the DOS Editor,” provides a tutorial approach to the built-in text-  ﬁle editor that comes with DOS. The examples developed in this chapter show you how to use the DOS Editor as a day-to-day utility. With the careful attention given to the Editor’s practical use, you learn the skills needed to quickly compose a text ﬁle. Practical examples, using the DOS Editor to create memos and batch ﬁles, also are pre- sented.    Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files,” guides you through the process of creating batch ﬁles and keystroke macros. The commands related to batch ﬁles are explained in a tutorial style. Useful examples make it easier to master the basics of batch ﬁles.    Chapter 17, “Understanding ANSI.SYS,” shows you how to make DOS screens look col-  orful and controlled. The details of the ANSI.SYS driver are presented in workshop fashion. You learn how to reassign keys, control the cursor’s position onscreen, display   6  Introduction  the date and time, and more. This chapter also describes the ANSI commands that you can use with the ANSI.SYS device driver provided by DOS. ANSI commands enable you to control how information is displayed on your screen.    Chapter 18, “Mastering DOSKEY and Macros,” covers an alternative to batch ﬁles. You can use the DOSKEY program to create simple macros that quickly accomplish  a series of tasks. You learn how to use DOSKEY to make entering DOS commands easier and faster, as well as how to record commonly used commands as macros.    Chapter 19, “Conﬁguring Your Computer,” is a comprehensive collection of DOS  commands and directives that can help you get the best performance from your PC.  In this chapter, you learn to use Microsoft MemMaker, a utility that automatically and optimally conﬁgures the way your PC uses RAM. You also learn how to set up your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁles to provide the best overall system conﬁguration.    Chapter 20, “Networking DOS,” discusses the Novell and Microsoft clients for DOS  and shows you how to install and conﬁgure each. You also learn how to identify and ﬁx various common network problems.    Chapter 21, “Connecting to the Internet,” covers your options for connecting to the Internet and explains the fundamentals of shell accounts. You learn how to use Telnet and FTP to download ﬁles and how to troubleshoot problems you might encounter with these tools.    Chapter 22, “Third-Party Utilities,” covers the basics of freeware, shareware, and  demoware and shows you how you can enhance your computer with this class of soft- ware. You learn about several powerful shareware utility programs that can help you get the most out of your DOS system.  Appendixes  Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition, also includes seven appendixes containing useful information:    Appendix A, “Files Supplied with MS-DOS 6.22,” lists the ﬁles that are provided with MS-DOS 6.22 and includes a brief description of what each ﬁle is used for. The infor- mation in this appendix can help you determine whether you can safely remove some of the ﬁles installed by DOS.    Appendix B, “DOS Environment Variables,” describes the environment variables used by DOS and its utility programs, which you can use to control the way DOS operates on your computer.    Appendix C, “DOS Messages,” lists and explains screen messages you might see while  you are using DOS.    Appendix D, “DOS and DOS Utility Programs’ Keyboard Commands,” lists the vari-  ous keyboard commands available at the DOS prompt or when you are using utility programs such as EDIT and DOSSHELL.   Conventions Used in This Book  7    Appendix E, “ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes,” This appendix lists the 256 charac-  ters deﬁned by the American Standard Code for Information Interchange  ASCII , which is the character set that DOS uses on PC-compatible computers.    Appendix F, “Command Reference,” lists in alphabetical order all the commands that DOS provides for use at the DOS prompt or in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. For each com- mand, the purpose, proper syntax, and notes concerning its use are provided. In many cases, examples and error messages are included to help you use the command correct- ly. If you are unsure of how to use a particular DOS command, or if you would like to know more about it, check the entry for the command in this section. The “Command Reference” is a complete, easy-to-use, quickly accessed resource on the proper use of DOS commands.    This book wraps up with Appendix G, “Glossary” which offers deﬁnitions for many of  the new terms you were introduced to in this book.  Conventions Used in This Book  Certain conventions are followed in this edition to help you more easily understand the dis- cussions:    UPPERCASE letters are used to distinguish ﬁlenames and DOS commands. Please  note, however, that although uppercase letters are used in the examples, you can type commands in either upper- or lowercase letters.    In most cases, keys are represented as they appear on your keyboard, and key combina- tions are connected by plus signs. For example, Ctrl+Break indicates that you press and hold the Ctrl key while you press the Break key. Other key combinations, such as Ctrl+Z or Alt+F1, are activated in the same manner.    Words or phrases deﬁned for the ﬁrst time appear in italic.   Words or phrases that you are asked to type appear in monospace. Screen displays and  onscreen messages also appear in a special monospace typeface.    Throughout the chapters of this book, syntax lines appear in monospace type and use  the conventions shown in the following example: dc:pathc\CHKDSK filename.ext  V  F  ? In any syntax line, not all elements can be represented in a literal manner. For example, filename.ext can represent any ﬁlename with any extension. It also can represent any ﬁlename with no extension at all. However, command names  such as CHKDSK  and switches  such as  V,  F, and  ?  are represented in a literal way. To activate the command CHKDSK.EXE, you ﬁrst must type the command name CHKDSK. Any literal text  text you type letter for letter  in a syntax line appears in UPPERCASE letters. Any variable text  text that acts as a placeholder for other text  is shown in  lowercase italic letters.   8  Introduction  The conventions used for syntax lines in the “Command Reference” are slightly different from those used in the chapters of this book. Refer to the section “The Conventions Used in This Command Reference” near the beginning of Appendix F for more information on how syntax lines are presented in that section.   PART  I  DOS Fundamentals  1 DOS and the Personal Computer 11  2 Starting DOS 23  3 Using DOS Commands 41  4 Using the DOS Shell 57    CHAPTER  1  DOS and the Personal Computer In this chapter  DOS, Windows, and the PC 12  Other Flavors of DOS 12  PC Hardware 12  What Happens When the Power Is Turned On? 15  DOS and Random Access Memory 17  DOS and Disks 20   12  Chapter 1 DOS and the Personal Computer  DOS, Windows, and the PC  You might find it hard to believe, but the personal computer is now more than 20 years old, and so is the MS-DOS operating system. At one time, more than 95% of all the tens of mil- lions of personal computers sold used MS-DOS as the operating system. Nowadays, almost all systems use a variation of the Windows operating system, although DOS compatibility is still provided through DOS subsystems. Previously, in Windows 95 98, you could boot into an MS-DOS command prompt, bypassing the Windows user interface. With the release of Windows ME, this capability is no longer available.  The objective of this chapter is to familiarize those of you who are less experienced comput- er users with the inner workings of your system. If you are an old hand and already familiar with the way your computer and DOS interact, you might want to skim through this chap- ter on your way to Chapter 2, “Starting DOS.”  For those readers who have been using computers only a short time or who have never checked out the inner workings of a PC, this chapter provides a quick introduction that gives you the basics. Knowing this information enables you to better exploit the features of DOS and gives you more control over your computing environment.  Other Flavors of DOS  Although MS-DOS is by far the most prevalent variant of the DOS family, one other ver- sion from IBM needs to be mentioned. Now that Microsoft has quit developing MS-DOS as a standalone product, this version is the only alternative for someone wanting new and advanced features of the operating system.  IBM has continued to develop the initial DOS product since its inception. It has released upgraded versions containing many of the same features of the upgraded MS-DOS versions.  The latest version is called PC DOS 2000. Some of the new features include Y2K compli- ance, support for the REXX programming language, PCMCIA cards, unattended schedul- ing, and remote installation.  PC Hardware  In 1981, IBM introduced the IBM PC, which became the worldwide standard for personal computers. This standard endures to this day—even through all the subsequent upgrades in technology.  In the early 1980s, IBM manufactured and sold more than half of all the personal computers sold. As the decade wore on, however, IBM’s grip on computer sales weakened and scores of manufacturers introduced models of their own. All these manufacturers adopted the basic hardware architecture that made the original IBM computers a de facto standard.   PC Hardware  13  The PC Architecture  The heart and soul of any personal computer is its central processing unit  CPU . The CPU is a microprocessor chip capable of receiving input, processing data, and producing the results as output. DOS-compatible personal computers have long been based on the Intel family of microprocessors and their clones.  Everything in your computer is designed around the needs of the CPU. The CPU is plugged or soldered into the main circuit board of your system, which is where the term motherboard comes from. The motherboard also contains the core group of components needed to build a complete computer system.  The CPU communicates to the rest of the system via the system bus. The system bus pro- vides a communications highway where the CPU can “talk to” memory chips, as well as to peripheral devices installed in the expansion slots along the bus.  Part I Ch 1  The word peripheral comes from the Greek language and means around the center. As it is used in computer jargon today, a peripheral is any device that is connected to your com- puter’s CPU, either by an expansion slot card or plugged into a port.  In your system, DOS plays the role of the traffic cop, organizing the flow of data in the computer and offering services that programs can use. DOS directs the activities of your system’s CPU and helps the CPU to communicate instructions and receive information from other parts of the system. In other words, DOS makes all the separate components inside your computer system work together as if they were all one single machine.  When you install a video card or a modem into an expansion slot in your computer, it must conform to certain standards. These standards ensure that both DOS and the CPU know how to interface with the device.  It is not unusual for some peripheral devices, such as parallel and serial communications ports, to be built directly onto the motherboard of the computer. These devices also must conform to the standards that allow DOS and the CPU to control them.  Computer Memory  To perform operations, your computer uses binary numbers to represent both data and pro- gram instructions. Binary numbers use the binary digits 0 and 1 in various combinations to represent everything you do with your computer. Binary digits are usually called bits, which is an abbreviation of binary digits.  Computer memory is nothing more than thousands—or millions—of individual switches that can have one of two states: on or off. The binary digit 0 represents off, whereas 1 rep- resents the on condition. Eight bits arranged together form a byte; the arrangement of bits within the byte can produce one of 256  28  possible values.   14  Chapter 1 DOS and the Personal Computer  Each one of the 256 possible values of a byte is arranged into an extension of the ASCII  American Standard Code for Information Interchange  code. The original ASCII code used seven bits to represent 128 different characters. After the eighth bit was added, ASCII could represent up to 256 characters. Officially, this set is called the PC 8 Symbol Set but has come to be known—somewhat inaccurately—by computerists all over the world as the ASCII Extended character set.  The first 32 ASCII codes represent common commands used by the CPU and peripherals for such activities as making the speaker beep, telling a printer to use compressed print, con- trolling data transmissions, and so on. The rest of the ASCII codes represent letters, numer- als, and graphic characters. Therefore, a method is needed to store this information and make it available to the CPU.  To store information, your computer typically uses three kinds of memory:     Random access memory  RAM    Read-only memory  ROM    Disk-based storage  Each type of memory plays a different role in your system.  Random access memory, or RAM for short, is a volatile form of memory. Volatile means that it can hold information only when electrically powered. If you turn off the power, all the information stored in RAM chips is lost. Think of RAM as an electronic chalkboard where information can be written and erased at will. When you turn off the computer, RAM is erased automatically. As you will see later in this chapter, RAM is broken down into three categories, determined by the way the computer addresses memory.  Read-only memory, or ROM for short, is a close cousin to RAM, with one important excep- tion: The information stored on ROM is nonvolatile. ROM information is permanently recorded on the circuits of the chip during manufacturing and cannot be erased. When you turn off the computer’s power, this information is not lost. When you turn the computer on again, the information stored in ROM is once again available to the CPU and to DOS. Your computer uses ROM to store instructions and programming, as you will see later in this chapter.  The third type of computer memory is disk storage. If you have the typical computer sys- tem, you can use both floppy disks and a hard disk  often called a hard drive  to store infor- mation while the computer is turned off. Disk storage uses metal or plastic disks coated with a magnetic material to record and play back information in much the same way as a stereo system uses magnetic tapes to record and play back music. Disk storage comes in a some- times bewildering array of formats. Later in this chapter, you will find the information you need to demystify disk storage.  Peripheral Devices  Although you might think of your computer system as a single machine, it actually is made up of many discrete peripheral devices. Strictly speaking, your computer is the CPU and its   What Happens When the Power Is Turned On?  15  Part I Ch 1  attached RAM. By themselves, the CPU and RAM can do nothing useful because there is no way to provide input for the CPU to work with, and no way for the CPU to provide output in a form you can understand and use. Without peripheral devices, a computer is worthless. Without an operating system such as DOS, your computer would be the modern equivalent of the Tower of Babel.  Every part of your computer except the CPU and memory is a peripheral device. Key- boards, disk drives, printers, and monitors are all examples of peripheral devices. One of the most basic jobs DOS performs for you is to provide the standards and programming neces- sary to add peripheral devices to your system so that you can get some work done.  Back in the wild and woolly days of personal computers, before the IBM PC, each computer maker employed its own standards and peripheral devices. If you had an Apple II computer, you couldn’t share disks with anyone who didn’t have an Apple II. If the keyboard for your TRS-80 broke, you couldn’t replace it with a keyboard from any other type of machine. Worst of all, if you went from an Apple II to another kind of computer, you had to learn  a whole new set of commands.  One of the ancestors of DOS was an operating system called CP M  Control Program for Microcomputers . CP M standardized the commands necessary for using a computer, many of which are still used in DOS, but each different computer manufacturer still used different standards for peripheral devices and disk formats. According to legend, IBM investigated using CP M as its operating system for the first PCs. As the rumor goes, there were differ- ences in time frames, engineering, and personalities, so IBM turned to a small upstart com- pany called Microsoft. If things had gone differently, this book might have been titled Special Edition Using CP M!  The simultaneous introduction of the IBM Personal Computer and DOS changed the com- puting world forever. For the first time, because of standardization, users could walk into a computer store and buy disk drives, video cards, keyboards, and other peripherals made by other companies to put into their IBM or compatible computers.  Peripherals that are sold today for personal computers adhere to two standards: hardware and software. The hardware standards ensure that peripherals can fit into your system with- out doing damage and that they can communicate with the CPU. The software standards imposed by DOS ensure that the peripheral becomes an integral, functioning part of your computer system.  What Happens When the Power Is Turned On?  When you flip the power switch on your computer system, you set into motion a series of steps that must occur before you can see the DOS prompt, which signals that your comput- er is ready for use. No doubt you have seen these steps performed, possibly without realiz- ing their significance. This set of steps is called booting the computer. This phrase refers to the old saying “pull yourself up by the bootstraps,” meaning to make something of yourself from nothing. That’s exactly what booting does; it makes that expensive paperweight on your desk into a fully functional computer.   16  Chapter 1 DOS and the Personal Computer  The first of these steps is the activation of the Power On Self Test  POST . The Power On Self Test is a program that has been recorded on a ROM chip located on the motherboard of your system. This program gets the ball rolling. First, it loads instructions into RAM for the CPU to follow. These instructions tell the computer to perform a quick self-diagnostic check of the hardware. One of the first things you see when you turn on the computer, therefore, is the system counting and testing the installed RAM.  Next, the POST checks to see that the system setup is still valid. Your system contains a special kind of chip called a Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor, or CMOS, that stores information about your system’s configuration. CMOS chips are used because they need only a trickle of power, which can be supplied by a battery, to retain the stored infor- mation for several years. Your system’s date and time settings are stored on this chip, along with information about installed floppy disk drives, hard disk configuration, and other sys- tem configuration information that can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. If the  system setup is okay, the POST passes on to the next step: loading the operating system.  When the self test is satisfied that everything about your system is in order, it is time to load DOS using another program found on your system’s ROM chips—the bootstrap loader. This program’s job is simple and to the point: Find the operating system’s loader on the disk and make it run. By default, the first place it searches is drive A, to see whether you have a bootable floppy disk inserted into the drive. If the program fails to find a disk in drive A, it next looks to your hard disk. When the loader finds a valid operating system  in this case DOS , it starts the program found on the boot sectors of the disk. Most computers today will allow you to specify in the BIOS where you want the computer to look for the operat- ing system loader—for example, going straight to the hard drive and bypassing searching the floppy drive.   Completely describing all the steps involved in booting DOS might take several pages and bore you to tears, so the following description is somewhat simplified. When the ROM bootstrap loader finds a disk with a bootable copy of DOS, it transfers control to that disk’s boot sectors, where the DOS loading program takes over.  The first file loaded is IO.SYS. IO.SYS places into memory the basic input output services DOS provides. After this file is loaded, the second file, MSDOS.SYS, is loaded. Between these two files, DOS sets up the many services it offers to programs, such as file handling, printer handling, and so on.  IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS If you look at a directory of your boot disk, you normally do not see the IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS files listed. Both of these files have the hidden attribute, which prevents the DIR command from listing them in the  directory.  Also, because hardware manufacturers sometimes alter portions of DOS to meet specific hardware needs, these files might have slightly different names. IBMIO.SYS and IBMDOS.SYS are common variations, for example.   DOS and Random Access Memory  17  MSDOS.SYS completes the foundation for providing DOS services to your system. After it  is loaded, it checks the disk’s boot directory  normally C:\  to see whether a file named  CONFIG.SYS is present. If this file is found, it is loaded into memory, converted to all upper- case letters, and interpreted. Each line of CONFIG.SYS specifies some type of configuration information, such as a device driver to be loaded or a system setting to be made. After these settings are established, COMMAND.COM is loaded.  COMMAND.COM is the user interface to DOS. Its job is to evaluate whether commands present- ed to DOS from the keyboard or from batch files are legal. If the commands are legal, they are run. If a command is not legal, COMMAND.COM is responsible for issuing one of those error messages that can prove so frustrating to new users.  Just before COMMAND.COM turns the computer over to you, the user, it checks to see whether a file called AUTOEXEC.BAT is present in the boot directory. AUTOEXEC.BAT is a standard batch file that usually contains commands to customize your DOS installation. The only thing special about AUTOEXEC.BAT is that it gets run automatically during bootup.  Part I Ch 1  DOS and Random Access Memory  To understand the memory issues that surround DOS and your computer system, you first need to know a bit of history. When Intel designed the 8088 and 8086 processors on which the first generation of DOS computers  PCs and XTs  was based, Intel thought that no user would ever need more than one megabyte  1MB  of memory. Most of the computers then in use had only 64 kilobytes  64KB  of memory, so this speculation might have been reasonable at the time. The problem is that this speculation was wrong—very wrong.  Real Mode Versus Protected Mode When Intel developed the 80286 processor, it created a new mode of operation that allowed the CPU to address memory of more than 1MB. Additionally, more than one program could run at the same time, with each program protected from the actions of other programs. This mode of operation was called protected mode.  To differentiate this new capability from the limited capabilities of the 8088 and 8086 processors, the term real mode was coined. Not until the release of the 80386 generation of processors did protected mode software begin to appear.  Shortly after the release of the IBM PC, Lotus released a hot new spreadsheet program called 1-2-3. Soon businesses were buying PCs by the carload just to run Lotus 1-2-3. It wasn’t long before users found they could build large spreadsheets that exceeded the memo- ry limits of their computers.  A few years later, IBM introduced the PC-AT, based on Intel’s 80286 processor. The AT’s processor was faster than those used in PC and XT machines, and it had the capability  to access up to 16MB of memory using a new processor feature called protected mode. Unfortunately, DOS was never enhanced to take advantage of this capability, so software developers never used the full capabilities of the 80286 chip. Many ATs lived and died  without ever running protected-mode software.   18  Chapter 1 DOS and the Personal Computer  Later still, Intel developed 80386 and 80486 chips that addressed up to 4 gigabytes  4GB  of memory. Until Windows 3.0 came on the scene, precious little software was able to run the computer’s protected mode. Instead, users simply used these machines as fast PCs. Users who needed more memory than the original 1MB had to rely on a memory scheme called expanded memory, which was created collectively by Lotus, Intel, and Microsoft.  Today, the current family of Intel chips is the Pentium group. They include the Pentium, Pentium MMX, Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium IV CPUs. Also, other companies, such as AMD, now are making Intel-based CPUs that are in direct competition with the Pentiums. The Pentium-based CPUs can address more than 4GB of memory, depending on the operating system and CPU version.  RAM is classified in three ways: conventional memory, expanded memory, and extended memory. Understanding the distinctions can be quite useful.  Conventional Memory  As you’ve already learned, the generation of personal computers that preceded DOS and the IBM PC used, at most, 64KB of random access memory. The Intel 8088 processor addressed up to 1MB—which was, at the time, a significant advance. Of this 1MB, 640KB was made available for DOS and applications programs to use. The remaining 384KB was reserved for system use. Figure 1.1 shows the way conventional memory is used under DOS.  Figure 1.1 Conventional memory is restricted to 1MB.  1024KB  Upper-memory blocks  ROM BIOS  HD  Controller ROM  Video ROM  Expanded memory page   frame  Video card RAM addresses  Free memory pool  available to programs  DOS, DOS  buffers and   tables  Device drivers and tables  Device drivers loaded at   boot  DOS Interrupt Table  640KB  1KB  0KB  As you can see in the figure, DOS places a table of available services into memory, begin- ning at byte 0. When DOS loads the rest of itself into memory, it occupies memory   DOS and Random Access Memory  19  Part I Ch 1  addresses beginning at 1KB. The space from 1KB to 640KB is reserved for DOS and what- ever programs you might run. Addresses of more than 640KB  the infamous 640KB barrier  are reserved for addresses for ROMs and for accessing video card memory.  In DOS, memory addresses use a segment:offset notation to pinpoint an exact location where data or program instructions can be stored. These address locations are always specified using the hexadecimal number system. Each segment is 64KB in length, but each segment begins only 16 bytes up from its neighbor. The offset portion of the address specifies how many bytes the address is from the beginning of the segment.  Programmers soon discovered that an extra block of usable memory can be gained by speci- fying the last possible segment in the 1MB area in the segment portion of the address. Using this trick opens up an extra 64KB  minus the 16 bytes that fall below the 1MB line   of memory, more than 1MB that can be addressed without sending DOS and the processor into never-never land. Thus, the high memory area was born.  This newly discovered high memory area was almost immediately grabbed by network designers. They saw this area as a safe place to put their data buffers, which didn’t take RAM away from running programs that were already beginning to feel the squeeze of the 640KB barrier.  Beginning with the release of DOS 5.0, users could employ unused addresses between 640KB and 1MB to run DOS, programs, and device drivers by using HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE to make this space available. You use the LOADHIGH and DEVICEHIGH DOS com- mands to place programs, device drivers, and even portions of DOS itself into the upper memory area.  ➔ For more information about using upper memory blocks, see Chapter 19, “Configuring Your Computer,”  p. 441.  Expanded Memory  When Lotus 1-2-3 users and others began demanding a way to access more than the 640KB memory provided by the conventional memory scheme, Lotus, Intel, and Microsoft worked together to come up with the Expanded Memory Specification  EMS , also known as the LIM 3.2 specification. This specification was adopted before the Intel 80286 processor hit the market. EMS was an immediate hit, which in part accounts for the fact that few software companies even tried to exploit the enhanced memory addressing capabilities of the 80286 processor. Programs that needed more than 640KB memory could easily be modified to adhere to the EMS system, so there was no great push for DOS to use the chip’s protected mode, which could address up to 16MB of RAM.  The Expanded Memory Specification makes more memory available to processors running in real mode, the name given to the mode of operation that mimics the original 8088 proces- sor used in PCs and XTs. The LIM specifications reserve a 64KB area of memory in the upper memory block  the area between 640KB and 1MB  for use as a page frame.  Shortly after the EMS specification was adopted, several companies—including AST Research, at the time the largest seller of add-on memory boards—came up with an   20  Chapter 1 DOS and the Personal Computer  Enhanced Expanded Memory Specification  EEMS . This new expanded memory scheme used a backfilling technique that eliminated the need for the page frame in upper memory and allowed expanded memory to reside inside the 640KB range. In fact, some early EEMS products required users to remove any RAM in their system above the 256KB mark, which provided 384KB of expanded RAM to be situated within conventional memory addresses.  The Expanded Memory Specification has always been, and will always be, a kludge. Life today would be much simpler for those folks who support computer users if the hardware and software manufacturers had taken a “bite-the-bullet” attitude when the 80286 processor became available and built systems to use extended memory.  The DOS Expanded Memory Manager  EMM386  made old-fashioned EMS boards obsolete because it simulated expanded memory using the extended memory.  Extended Memory  The Extended Memory Specification  XMS  is a simpler way of making memory addresses of more than 1MB available to your programs. Extended memory is simply an extension of conventional memory addresses. The 384KB system memory area is still present under XMS, so programs can use the conventional 640KB memory area and addresses greater  than 1MB.  To implement extended memory, the protected mode operations of the processor  80286, 80386, 80486, or higher  are turned on. DOS accomplishes this task by loading HIMEM.SYS at bootup from the CONFIG.SYS file. HIMEM, which is an extended memory manager, enables DOS to address memory above the conventional 1MB mark.  Few DOS programs take advantage of the availability of extended memory. Windows and Windows programs, however, routinely use extended memory.  DOS and Disks  RAM is volatile storage. As soon as the power goes off, RAM goes to sleep. ROM provides  a permanent storage medium, but you can’t write files to ROM. What is needed is a third method of storing data and programs. DOS stands for disk operating system, so if you get the notion that disks are used for permanent storage of data and programs, give yourself the afternoon off.  One of the major functions of DOS is to facilitate the reading and writing of data stored on disks. Disks are circular platters of plastic or metal coated with a magnetic emulsion similar to that used to produce cassette or video tapes.  By offering standardized disk services, DOS saves programmers countless hours of work because their programs can simply ask DOS to read or write a disk. The programmer is spared the task of writing code to store data. These DOS file services also provide an added benefit to computer users: Because DOS takes care of placing files onto disks, any file creat- ed by a DOS program can reside on the same disk as any other DOS file.   DOS and Disks  21  When a program writes to a disk, DOS ensures that the data is stored as a named collection of information called a file. DOS rules determine naming conventions. A legal DOS file- name can be from one to eight characters, followed by an optional period and a one- to three-character extension. A filename’s extension is most often used to indicate the type of file being stored.  Part I Ch 1  In the case of Windows 95 98 ME, you can use long filenames in Windows, but when you are looking at the files from DOS, the filenames are shortened to the standard 8.3 format. The name is shortened by taking the first six characters of the filename and then adding a tilde  ~  followed by an incrementing value, starting with 1.  Windows NT 2000 shows the long filename for files and directories in the command prompt window.  For more information on this and other DOS file operations, see Chapter 8, “Managing Your Files.”  Floppy disks are wafer-thin plastic disks coated with a magnetic emulsion and encased with- in a protective sleeve. The original IBM PC used floppy disks measuring 5 1 4 inches across. Today, 3 1 2-inch floppies have become the industry standard. The advantages of the 3 1 2-inch format are the greater data density  the disks hold considerably more infor- mation than the physically larger 5 1 4-inch disks  and the hard plastic sleeve that better protects the disks from damage.  Floppy disks are most commonly used to store data to be archived or transferred to another computer. The biggest disadvantages of floppy disks are that reading and writing on flop- pies is relatively slow, and they do not hold enough information to accommodate today’s larger programs and data files.  Hard disks are nonremovable, high-capacity, rigid platters sealed inside a dust-free casing. For increased storage capacity, several platters can be stacked within a single hard disk drive where multiple pickup heads are used to read and write the stored information. You can find more detailed information about magnetic disks in Chapter 7, “Preparing and Maintaining Disks.”  Another storage technology finding wider use today is removable media. This technology uses cartridges that can hold anywhere from 100MB to 2GB of data. The most popular brand is Iomega, with the Zip  100MB–250MB  and Jaz  1GB–2GB  disks and drives. Another newer option is the LS-120 floppy disk, which uses a special 3 1 2-inch floppy disk and drive and can hold up to 120MB of data. The best thing about this solution is that the LS-120 drive can still read standard floppies, which eliminates the need for an additional drive.    CHAPTER  2  Starting DOS In this chapter  Booting Your Computer 24  System Configuration 26  Creating Multiple Configurations 32  Project: Controlling the Boot Process 38   24  Chapter 2 Starting DOS  Booting Your Computer  In Chapter 1, “DOS and the Personal Computer,” you read a description of the steps taken when you boot up your computer. In fact, two types of booting are available. The first is known as a cold boot. This term comes from the fact that the computer’s power is off and the unit is not yet warm. As you might guess, the second type of boot is the warm boot.  A cold boot occurs when you turn on the power switch to your system. Some systems also have a reset button. Pressing this button also triggers a cold boot. The difference between  a cold and warm boot is simple. A cold boot begins at the absolute beginning, using the Power On Self Test  POST  to check the condition of the system’s major components  and RAM.  A warm boot, on the other hand, bypasses the preliminary self test, moving directly to the loading of the operating system. A warm boot is triggered when you press the Ctrl+Alt+Del keys all at the same time. This combination of keys was chosen because on most keyboards it is almost impossible to press these three keys simultaneously by accident.  Although the general population might believe differently, computer users have a tremen- dous sense of humor. This sense of humor has introduced two slang terms to distinguish between cold and warm boots. Because early PCs had a large red power switch on the side of the case, cold booting has been dubbed “Big Red Button Time,” or BRB for short. A BRB is usually necessary only when your system is so thoroughly hung up and confused that it fails to respond to the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination. Pressing these three keys normally triggers a warm boot, so some anonymous wag named a warm boot “the three-finger salute.”  Using the Ctrl+Alt+Del combination for a warm reboot works only when you are booted straight into DOS. If you are using Windows 9x, using Ctrl+Alt+Del first brings up a task list. From there, you have the option of shutting down or canceling. Microsoft provided this extra step to encourage users to shut down Windows instead of just warm-booting the machine.  The net effect of either a cold or warm boot is to wipe the slate clean and start the  computer out fresh. Being the sophisticated computer user that you are, of course, you should realize that rebooting the computer on a whim could be a dangerous proposition. Triggering a boot when a file is open and you’re in the process of editing can cause you to lose valuable data because you don’t have an opportunity to save the file to disk before the boot takes place.  Understanding the Boot Disk  In the preceding chapter, you learned that during the booting process three files are  loaded into memory: IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM. You also learned that two other   Booting Your Computer  25  Part I Ch 2  files—CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT—are used in the boot process as well. The reason for calling this information to your attention again is to point out that DOS is not a monolithic creation. Rather, DOS is composed of many modular components working together.  DOS is not, however, a mind reader, so you are required to specially prepare bootable disks capable of starting your computer. You can create bootable disks in two ways: You can use the FORMAT command, with the  S switch, or you can use the SYS command.  When you use the FORMAT command to create a bootable disk, using the  S switch causes the newly formatted disk to contain the disk portion of the bootstrap loader in the boot sector, IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM. If any of these four conditions is not satisfied, you can- not use the disk to start DOS.  Using the SYS command to make a disk bootable requires you to know a few undocumented facts about the way boot disks are constructed. For a disk to be bootable, the following con- ditions must be met:    IO.SYS must be the first directory entry in the root directory of the disk.   MSDOS.SYS must be the second entry in the root directory.   IO.SYS must be the first physical file on the disk.  Knowing these three rules, you now can understand more readily why the SYS command so often reports the No Room for System on Destination Disk error message even though the disk has plenty of free space. If files already are written on the disk, chances are that the first directory entry in the root is taken.  Many years ago, when DOS was well on the way to becoming the number one bootlegged software of all time, the DOS development team came up with the  B switch to the FORMAT command. Sending someone a bootable disk is a violation of your DOS software license because that disk enables the person to start up a computer with software for which he or she hasn’t paid. The idea behind the  B switch is to reserve space on the disk so that you can use the SYS command later to make the disk bootable.  In practice, the  B switch of the FORMAT command simply copies IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS to the newly formatted disk, leaving off COMMAND.COM and the bootstrap loader. This restriction ensures that the SYS command can come along later and finish the job of making the disk bootable. You might need the  B switch only once every five years, but it can come in handy.  Creating a Floppy Boot Disk  These days, finding a computer system lacking a hard drive is unusual, if not impossible. The single major exception to this rule is a network workstation where the file server pro- vides all the hard drive storage needed  at one time this was very common in Novell-based networks . Because the boot process must be local to the workstation on a standard PC, booting from a floppy in this case is a no-brainer.  Booting from the computer’s hard drive is, in general, more efficient. Hard drives are faster than floppy drives, so booting from the hard drive gets you to a DOS prompt more quickly.   26  Chapter 2 Starting DOS  In some cases, though, you need to have a floppy disk to boot from. One scenario would be where COMMAND.COM on the hard drive has been damaged. To recover from this damage, you would need to boot from a floppy and copy the system files back to your hard drive using the SYS.COM command.  Follow these steps to create a boot floppy:  1. Format a floppy disk in drive A using the  S  System  switch to make it a bootable   disk. If you have compressed your drive with DoubleSpace, FORMAT automatically copies DBLSPACE.BIN to the new floppy as a hidden system file.  2. Copy AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS to the new boot disk. 3. Copy all the files you need for a clean boot to the floppy. Include DBLSPACE.SYS if you  have compressed disks. If you are going to be using the disk as an emergency backup to repair system files on a hard drive, you should also copy the SYS.COM file over.  I have found it is also very useful to use a DOS boot disk along with a DOS CD-ROM driver to load new systems where I want to copy the source files without adding CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT to the hard drive. You can do the same by creating a boot disk with all the files that are necessary to prepare a hard drive, such as FDISK, FORMAT, and SYS, along with the MCSDEX command for the CD-ROM. Using driver device files is discussed further in Chapter 13, “Controlling Devices.”  ➔ For a detailed description of the boot process, see “What Happens When the Power Is Turned On” in  Chapter 1, “DOS and the Personal Computer,” p. 15.  System Configuration  If you are not a long-time computer user, or if you have always had someone else maintain your system configurations for you, you might not be familiar with the roles played by two important files during startup. The CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files customize the way your computer is configured. These files load drivers, set options, and tweak the DOS envi- ronment.  The DOS environment is a space in memory reserved for creating variables that can be looked at by programs running on your system. The default size of the DOS environment is only 256 bytes in length. Some programs make extensive use of the DOS environment to store customization settings. You can use the SHELL command to increase the size of the environment.  ➔ For a detailed description of the syntax and usage of the SHELL command, see Appendix F, “Command  Reference,” p. 583.   System Configuration  27  CONFIG.SYS  During the boot process, as soon as IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS are loaded into memory and before COMMAND.COM is loaded, a search is made of the root directory of the boot disk to see whether the CONFIG.SYS file exists. On 99% of the computers in use today, the file is avail- able.  When CONFIG.SYS is found, its contents are read into memory, and the file is acted on line by line. Each line in CONFIG.SYS contains a DOS command that tells DOS to enhance the DOS configuration.  A number of DOS commands are valid in CONFIG.SYS. Table 2.1 gives a quick rundown of those commands. For detailed information, refer to Appendix F, “Command Reference.”   Table 2.1 Commands Often Used in CONFIG.SYS  Part I Ch 2  Command  BREAK  BUFFERS  COUNTRY  DEVICE  DOS  FCBS  FILE  INCLUDE  INSTALL  LASTDRIVE  MENUCOLOR  MENUITEM  NUMLOCK  REM  SET  SHELL  Meaning Determines how DOS reacts to the Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C keystrokes.  Sets the number of file buffers DOS uses in transferring data to and from disk.  Configures language-dependent features.  Loads a device driver  special software to control your computer’s configuration  in conventional memory.  DEVICEHIGH  Loads a device driver into upper memory  above 640KB .  Determines whether DOS is loaded into the high memory area and whether DOS maintains links to upper memory blocks.  DRIVPARM  Modifies the parameters for an existing drive by specifying information about tracks, sectors, heads, and so on.  Determines the number of file control blocks that can be open simultaneously. Needed only for ancient software compatibility.  Sets the number of files that can be open simultaneously.  Includes the contents of a configuration block.  Loads a memory-resident  TSR  program.  Specifies the highest valid disk drive letter.  Defines a startup menu’s text and background colors.  MENUDEFAULT  Specifies the default configuration block and a timeout value.  Identifies items on the startup menu.  Specifies the initial setting of the NUMLOCK key.  Creates a remark. Nothing following REM on the same line is acted on by DOS during booting.  Creates and sets values for environment variables.  Informs DOS what command processor should be used. SHELL also is used to increase the default size of the DOS environment.   28  Chapter 2 Starting DOS  Table 2.1 Continued  Command  Meaning  STACKS  SUBMENU  SWITCHES  Sets the number and size of stacks used to process hardware interrupts.

Table 2.2 provides a quick play-by- play of each line of the CONFIG.SYS file shown in Figure 2.1. If you want more in-depth information about one of the commands discussed here, see the “Command Reference.”  Table 2.2 Play-by-Play of a Typical CONFIG.SYS File  Command  DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS  Meaning Uses the DEVICE command to load HIMEM.SYS, the Extended Memory Manager. HIMEM.SYS accesses memory addresses above 1MB, including the high memory area from 1024KB to 1088KB. This file must be loaded before EMM386.  Uses DEVICE to load EMM386.EXE, the  Expanded  Memory Manager. The parameters shown on this line  from left to right  specify no EMS memory, check availability of upper  memory blocks, disable VCPI support, and  areas in upper reserve memory for Windows.  You must load EMM386.EXE to get access to upper memory  640KB to 1024KB .

Sets up 15 buffers for transferring files, with  0 secondary cache buffers created.  Specifies that DOS make 49 file handles available so that many files can be open at a time.  Specifies that drive N is the highest drive present in the system. This setting should include drives  created by DoubleSpace and any drives used by your network if you are connected to one.  Specifies that nine stacks of 256 bytes each are used to handle hardware interrupts.  The  k switch disables extended keyboard support, and the  f switch dispenses with the default two- second delay after the Starting MS-DOS... message appears during bootup.  Increases the size of the DOS environment to  512 bytes. Don’t forget to use the  P switch if you use this command; otherwise, DOS ignores AUTOEXEC.BAT at boot time.  Loads the SETVER driver into upper memory.  DEVICEHIGH  L:2,10928 = C:\DOS\SBPCD.SYS  D:MSCD01  P:220  Loads a CD-ROM driver into upper memory  and specifies MSCD01 as the device name.  DEVICEHIGH  L:2,44784 = C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS  MOVE  Loads the DoubleSpace driver into upper  memory.  If upper memory is not available when you use the DEVICEHIGH command, DOS loads drivers into conventional memory as though the DEVICE command were used.  You easily can customize your CONFIG.SYS file by using the EDIT command. Exercise caution, however, because you accidentally can alter commands that screw up your configuration. Using the following command to make a backup of the file before editing is always a good idea: COPY CONFIG.SYS CONFIG.OLD  That way, you can restore the old settings if something goes wrong.  When modifying any file, it is a good idea to not remove any lines, but rather add REM to the beginning of the line. This causes the file to ignore that line, because it is seen as a remark, not a command.   30  Chapter 2 Starting DOS  AUTOEXEC.BAT  After COMMAND.COM is loaded into memory during the boot process, the system is ready for you to use. The last task the boot process performs is to look in the boot directory for the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If an AUTOEXEC.BAT file is found, it is then fed to COMMAND.COM’s batch-file processor.  AUTOEXEC.BAT can contain almost any legal DOS command, except those commands such as DEVICE and SHELL, which are reserved for use in CONFIG.SYS. AUTOEXEC.BAT is used mostly to run commands that further configure the DOS session and to run those commands that need to be run only once when the computer is started up.  Although DOS now enables you to use the SET command in either CONFIG.SYS or  AUTOEXEC.BAT, traditionally you found these SET commands exclusively in AUTOEXEC.BAT or in batch files run later for special purposes. There is one good reason to continue this practice. If you have your initial SET commands split between CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, you pos- sibly can create the same variable twice by using different values. If CONFIG.SYS contains the line SET TEMP=C:\TEMP and AUTOEXEC.BAT contains the line SET TEMP=C:\MYTEMP, for example, the value of the TEMP variable is MYTEMP after AUTOEXEC.BAT is run.  In effect, AUTOEXEC.BAT is nothing but a regular batch file. Two things make it special, how- ever. The first  and most important item  is that it is executed automatically each time your computer is booted. The second is that because AUTOEXEC.BAT is considered part of the  booting process, DOS 6.2 enables you to step interactively through each command in AUTOEXEC.BAT, just as you can through CONFIG.SYS. This capability is discussed in more  detail in the next section.  ➔ For a better understanding of batch files, see Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files,” p. 389.  To better understand your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, check out Figure 2.2. It lists the contents of a typical AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The @ symbol at the beginning of the line suppresses display of the command line.   Clears the screen.  Alters the way the DOS prompt is displayed. The $P$G portion of the line causes the prompt to show the currently logged drive and path, fol- lowed by a greater-than sign  > . You can use the PROMPT command to turn the DOS prompt into anything you want it to be.  To learn how to change the look of the com- mand prompt, see “Changing the Command Prompt with PROMPT” in Chapter 11, p. 295, and “Issuing ANSI.SYS Codes with the PROMPT Command” in Chapter 17, p. 419. Also, see “PROMPT” in the “Command Reference.”  Specifies where and in what order DOS should search directories when a command is entered at the DOS prompt or in a batch file. DOS looks in these directories for a COM, EXE, or BAT file having the same name as the command. Only after these directories have been searched does DOS return the dreaded Bad Command or File Name error message.  For detailed information about error and other messages, see Appendix C, “DOS Messages.”  These four lines use the SET command to place  variables in the DOS environment. Environment variables can contain character  strings, which programs can use to determine  parameters. The SET BLASTER variable,  for example, documents the Sound Blaster Pro  card’s installation parameters. Programs that  play sounds routinely rely on this variable to  provide information they need.  Loads the SMARTDRV.EXE utility into upper memory.  Loads the DOS mouse driver into upper  memory.

Loads the MSCDEX utility, which assigns a drive  letter to a CD-ROM drive that has been loaded in CONFIG.SYS. The  d switch specifies the drive name that was provided in CONFIG.SYS.  Creates an environment variable that specifies how the DOS prompt should be displayed when you’re running a DOS session under Windows.  Automatically launches Windows every time the computer boots.  Remember, nothing is sacred or untouchable about AUTOEXEC.BAT; it’s simply another batch file. Use the EDIT command to add and delete entries to create the exact startup configura- tion you want to have each time you use your computer. Creating a backup of the file before you edit it is always a good idea, of course. Use the following: COPY AUTOEXEC.BAT AUTOEXEC.OLD  By creating a backup, you can restore the previous version if you accidentally mess up your configuration.  ➔ For more information about the EDIT command, see Chapter 15, “Using the DOS Editor,” p. 361. ➔ For more detailed information, see “Fine-Tuning Your Computer with CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT” in  Chapter 19, “Configuring Your Computer,” p. 463.  Creating Multiple Configurations  Being able to boot your computer into one of several configurations is often handy. You might run a DOS program that requires expanded memory, for example, but nothing else you do requires EMS. If you run Windows and Windows programs most of the time, the 64KB page frame in expanded memory  EMS , also called upper memory, can be a drag on performance, so doing without the EMS is better. Maybe you have reason to log in to a net- work several times a day, but some of your programs object to having the network shell take up memory that they want to use. You might have any number of reasons to want different configurations at different times.  With earlier versions of DOS, you had to jump through hoops if you needed to have more than one standard configuration. A common trick was to have two or more versions of  CONFIG.SYS tucked away in subdirectories or written in the boot directory with alternative names. When you needed a configuration different from your normal working environment, you had to copy one of these alternative CONFIG.SYS files into the boot directory and reboot. Changing back to your normal configuration was just as complex. No more!   Creating Multiple Configurations  33  A new DOS feature enables you to create multiple configurations within your CONFIG.SYS file and display a menu of the available options. To create a boot menu, all you have to do is divide your CONFIG.SYS files into sections by naming each section. A section name consists of a word inside brackets, as in [menu]. Two section names have special meanings.  The [menu] creates the menu of options displayed at boot time. Each menu item is created with a line similar to the following: menuitem=Normal,Everyday Configuration  The word to the right of the equal sign is the name of the section you want to use for your configuration, and the words following the comma make up the menu prompt. If you omit the description, the section name is used as the menu prompt.  The [common] section enters lines that should be used in all your various configurations. You can have more than one section named [common]. DOS executes these sections in the order in which they appear in the file.  Microsoft recommends that multiple configuration CONFIG.SYS files end with a [common] section, even if it is empty. You end the file with a [common] section to accommodate pro- grams that create entries in CONFIG.SYS. Usually, programs append their entries to the end of CONFIG.SYS. By having a [common] section at the end of your file, you ensure that new entries are always executed.  Figure 2.3 shows a multiple configuration CONFIG.SYS file. When the computer on which this CONFIG.SYS file resides boots up, a menu appears offering you two different configura- tions. If you select Work, the network and mouse drivers are loaded. If you select Games,  no network or mouse driver is loaded. Instead, the ANSI.SYS driver is loaded. In all other respects, the configurations are the same because those aspects of the DOS session are con- trolled by the entries in the [common] sections.  Part I Ch 2  Figure 2.3 A multiple configura- tion CONFIG.SYS file.

Here’s an example: menudefault=work,5  Placing this line in the [menu] section causes DOS to default to the work configuration if a menu selection is not made within five seconds after the menu is displayed.  Displaying Color Menus  Another command enables you to specify screen colors for displaying the boot menu. Here’s an example: menucolor=15,1  Placing this line in the [menu] section of CONFIG.SYS causes DOS to display the menu using bright white letters on a blue background. The first parameter supplies the color code for the foreground color; the second parameter, which is optional, specifies the background color. If you do not specify the background color, the default value of 0  black  is used. Table 2.4 shows the valid color codes you can use.  Table 2.4  CONFIG.SYS Menu Colors  Number 0  Color Black  Blue  Green  Cyan  Red  Magenta  Brown  White  Gray  Bright Blue  Bright Green  Bright Cyan  Bright Red  Bright Magenta  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13   Creating Multiple Configurations  35  Table 2.4 Continued  Number  14  15  Color  Yellow  Bright White  You can pull an undocumented trick when you’re specifying menu colors. Most video cards are not capable of displaying bright colors  9 through 15  as the background color. If you specify a bright background color on most video cards, the foreground color is set to blink. Thus, the following line produces a blinking yellow foreground on a standard blue back- ground: menucolor=14,9  Part I Ch 2  Figure 2.4 shows how you can edit the sample CONFIG.SYS file in Figure 2.3 to display a menu in color. The foreground is yellow and the background is blue. Descriptive menu prompts and a default configuration also have been added.  Figure 2.4 Displaying a configu- ration menu in color with descriptive prompts and a default configuration.  [menu] menuitem=work,Normal Configuration menuitem=games,Let’s Play Games menucolor=14,1 menudefault=work,10  [common] DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS BUFFERS =15,0 FILES=49 DOS=UMB,HIGH  [work] DEVICE=C:\DOS\NET.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\MOUSE.SYS  [games] DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS  [common]  The CONFIG.SYS file shown in Figure 2.4 renders the menu shown in Figure 2.5. Notice that DOS precedes each menu choice with a number. You can select a menu prompt in one of two ways. The first method is to press the number key corresponding to the prompt you want to select. The second method is to highlight the desired prompt and press Enter.   36  Chapter 2 Starting DOS  Figure 2.5 The DOS 6.2 startup menu.  MS-DOS 6.2 Startup Menu =======================  1. Normal Configuration 2. Let’s Play Games  Enter a choice: 1       Time remaining: 10  F5=Bypass startup files F8=Confirm each line of CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT [N]  Using the Configuration Menu As a System Menu  Almost everyone who is computer literate knows someone who just will never get the hang of working with computers. These same people are the ones you give the exact syntax of the COPY command letter by letter every time they call you with a problem. These users figure out just enough about one or two programs to get their work done and to be dangerous. Sadly, even DOSSHELL is a mystery to them.  You can employ a trick using DOS environment variables to turn the CONFIG.SYS configura- tion menu into a system menu that runs a particular program each time the computer is booted. When a particular configuration is chosen, DOS automatically creates an environ- ment variable named CONFIG. As its value, this variable is given the name of the configura- tion section chosen. If you choose to have a section called [net] as your configuration, for example, the value of CONFIG is net.  You can use the value of CONFIG to branch off within the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to run commands specific to that configuration. Assume that CONFIG.SYS contains three sections that offer you a choice in the configuration menu between Windows, WordPerfect, and Lotus 1-2-3. Also, assume that these sections are named WINDOWS, WP, and LOTUS.  In batch files, you can create sections similar to the sections that you can create in CONFIG.SYS. In batch files, however, you name sections by using the colon  : , as in the fol- lowing: :labelname  You can execute a specific section of commands by using the GOTO command inside the batch file. Because AUTOEXEC.BAT is a batch file like any other, you can use the value of the CONFIG variable to branch off in AUTOEXEC.BAT. Figure 2.6 shows how you might construct such an AUTOEXEC.BAT file.   Figure 2.6 Use the CONFIG variable to run  configuration-specific commands.  Creating Multiple Configurations  37  ECHO OFF CLS PROMPT $P$G PATH C:\DOS;D:\WINDOWS;C:\;C:\NU SET PCPLUS-F:\PROCOMM SET TEMP=C:\TEMP SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T2 SET SOUND=G:\SBPRO LH  L:0;1,42432  S C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE LH  L:1,56928 C:\DOS\MOUSE.COM  Y LH  L:1,13984 C:\DOS\SHARE  L:500 LH  L:1,6400 C:\DOS\DOSKEY.COM REM  Commands above are common to all configurations.

As you can see in the figure, AUTOEXEC.BAT is divided into five sections. The first section contains all the commands common to all configurations. This section isn’t named because DOS begins executing lines at the top. The last line of this section uses GOTO to branch directly to one of the three choices on the CONFIG.SYS menu.  Three named sections occupy the middle of the file. Because they each finish with a GOTO command that directs the batch file to the :END section, only those commands in the chosen section execute.  The :END section is necessary to let DOS skip over the sections that haven’t been chosen and to let any commands added by software installation take effect. The problem is that commands in the :END section do not take effect until you exit from whatever program is called by one of the named sections above :END. When you install new software, always check AUTOEXEC.BAT if you use this technique because you might have to move entries up into the first section of commands common to all configurations.   38  Chapter 2 Starting DOS  A drawback to using this technique is that when you exit the program, you don’t have any way to loop back into the menu except to reboot the computer. Also, the startup menu always advertises the availability of the F5 and F8 keys.  Make sure not to simply reboot the computer while you’re still in an application program; otherwise, you lose data. Similarly, avoid using the F5 or F8 keys, or you might think the menu is broken.  Project: Controlling the Boot Process  Users who practice safe computing should make sure that they have a floppy-based boot disk before messing with either CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT. Fortunately, the DOS develop- ment team has made this practice less necessary. A new feature introduced in DOS 6.0 enables you to use function keys to exercise control over the boot.  Imagine, for example, that you have just edited AUTOEXEC.BAT to load a program during bootup. For whatever reason, this program is incompatible with your system, and the com- puter simply freezes each time the command is run. You can never get to a DOS prompt to edit the file because the machine hangs every time. You can boot off your floppy boot disk, of course, but now you have an easier way.  When the Starting MS-DOS... message appears onscreen during the boot process, you know that IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS are about to be loaded. At this point, you can press two keys or key combinations that modify the boot process. If you use DOS 6.0, you can use the F5 and F8 keys; with DOS 6.2, you can use these two keys or Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+F8.  If you press the F5 key when the message appears, DOS bypasses loading and processing both CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. You boot up as if you had a floppy boot disk that didn’t contain these files.  If you have installed DoubleSpace, you also can press Ctrl+F5. This key combination not only skips CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, but also skips the loading of DoubleSpace. This practice is great if you have programs  such as the latest high-performance games  that do not work with disk-compression programs such as DoubleSpace.  If you press the F8 key when the Starting MS-DOS... message appears, DOS displays the following message: MS-DOS will prompt you to confirm each CONFIG.SYS command.  Each line in CONFIG.SYS then is displayed along with a [Y,N] prompt. To execute the dis- played command, press either Y or Enter  not both . To bypass the command, press N.  After you have dealt with all the lines in CONFIG.SYS, you see the following message: Process AUTOEXEC.BAT [Y,N]?   Project: Controlling the Boot Process  39  DOS is giving you the option of bypassing the execution of AUTOEXEC.BAT. Answer this query as you did the earlier ones. If you press N, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is skipped entirely. If you are using DOS 6.2 and you press Y, each line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is displayed, in turn, and you can choose whether you want it executed.  The final key combination you can use to modify the boot process is Ctrl+F8. If you  press this combination, you can process CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT interactively, but DoubleSpace is not loaded. Understand that if you choose this option, drivers or programs that you attempt to load  which are normally stored on a compressed drive  are not  accessible.  After you have broken through to the DOS prompt, you then can use the EDIT command to rectify whatever problem keeps your system from successfully booting.  By default, who a two-second delay occurs between the time the Starting MS-DOS... mes- sage appears and the loading of DOS system files begins. If you eliminate this delay by using the SWITCHES= F command in CONFIG.SYS, DOS still can recognize the F5, Ctrl+F5, F8, or Ctrl+F8 keystrokes. Even on a fast hard drive, IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS take a second or two to load. You should be able to break in with a keystroke before CONFIG.SYS is processed.    CHAPTER  3  Using DOS Commands In this chapter  Understanding DOS Commands 42  Understanding the Elements of a DOS Command 42  Getting Help 46  Issuing DOS Commands 51  Troubleshooting 55   42  Chapter 3 Using DOS Commands  Understanding DOS Commands  When you want your computer to perform an action, you communicate this request for ser- vice by entering commands at the DOS prompt. All DOS commands begin with a word, sometimes called a keyword, that identifies the action you want to take. Most DOS com- mands can accept parameters that refine the scope of the command. The DIR command, for example, tells DOS to show you a list of files written on a disk. Adding parameters to this command enables you to specify exactly the files you want listed.  Internal Versus External  DOS recognizes and responds to more than 80 commands. The programming to provide the most commonly used commands is contained within the DOS command interpreter, COMMAND.COM. You use commands such as DIR and COPY so frequently that making them avail- able on demand whenever the computer is displaying a DOS prompt saves time. Because DOS does not have to launch  start  any program to provide the service, the commands pro- vided by COMMAND.COM are called internal commands. You can tell which commands are inter- nal by looking in the directory where DOS is installed. You never find COPY.COM or COPY.EXE, so you know that the COPY command is internal.  Other commands are stored as utility programs in a directory on your hard disk. Because these commands are not built into the command processor, they are called external commands. When you type a command that COMMAND.COM does not recognize as one of its internal commands, COMMAND.COM responds by looking on disk for a program file having the same name as the command. The FORMAT command, for example, is provided by program- ming found in the file FORMAT.COM, which is located in the DOS directory.  Whether internal or external, all DOS commands conform to rules that provide a grammar or syntax that is consistent throughout DOS. As a user, you need to make sure only that DOS can find the program files for external commands.  Understanding the Elements of a DOS Command To begin to understand DOS commands, you first need to know a few fundamental facts:    DOS requires that you use a specific set of rules, or syntax, when you issue commands.   All DOS commands begin with a keyword that identifies the action you want per-    Parameters, which are a part of a command’s syntax, refine the way a command is exe-  formed.  cuted.  Syntax is the order in which you type the elements of the DOS command—its grammar. If you say, “Ball red the choose I,” people probably will not understand that you are trying to say, “I choose the red ball.” Some people might understand what you are trying to say, but not many. A computer, on the other hand, has no intelligence or imagination; it can inter- pret commands only according to its programming. Programming several optional syntaxes   Understanding the Elements of a DOS Command  43  for commands requires using a great deal of extra memory and disk space, which cuts down on the resources available to do real work. That’s why you have to supply the intelligence and imagination and why you must enter DOS commands precisely according to the rules of command syntax.  You can think of the command keyword as the action part, or verb, of a DOS command. In addition to the keyword, many commands require or allow further directions. You supply these directions as parameters and switches. Parameters tell DOS what action to take or how to apply the action. Using DOS commands is easy as long as you follow the rules of order and use the correct parameters. After you know the basic rules, you often can figure out parameters for commands that you don’t use on a regular basis.  You run applications software—such as word processors or drawing programs—by entering a command at the DOS prompt. The command you use to start an application is the name of the program file  COM or EXE  in which the programming for the software is stored.  Part I Ch 3  Most applications software incorporates the issuing of commands as part of the software’s operation. The commands discussed in this book are DOS commands. Be sure that you know the difference between DOS commands, which you issue at the DOS command line, and the commands you learn to use with your applications software.  If you are unsure whether a command you have been taught to use is part of DOS, look in Appendix F, “Command Reference.” If that command is not listed, it is an application pro- gram command, not a DOS command.  The Command Syntax  The syntax for most DOS commands can be boiled down to one of the following two sim- ple formats: KEYWORD Drive\Files Switches  KEYWORD SourceFiles TargetFiles Switches  A DOS command always begins with the keyword, which is the name of the command, fol- lowed by a space. If you use the language metaphor, the keyword is the verb that specifies the action to be taken.  The first example shows the common form for DOS commands that don’t change files in some way. The Drive\Files portion of the example is a parameter that specifies what drive or files on which the command is supposed to act. This parameter is analogous to a noun in English. In other words, the parameter is the thing on which the verb acts. This portion of the syntax is in italic to show that the parameter is optional. The parameter also can be followed by command-line switches. To extend the language metaphor, switches are like adverbs; they modify the verb. They change the action to be done.   44  Chapter 3 Using DOS Commands  The second example here is typical of the syntax for most DOS commands that operate on groups of files. The keyword, of course, specifies the action, followed by two parameters that indicate the disk or files that provide the data source for the action. The second para- meter indicates the target disk or files. To copy a group of files from one disk or directory to another, for example, you can use the following command: COPY A:Myfile.TXT B:Yourfile.TXT  This command copies a file having the name MYFILE.TXT on drive A into the memory of your computer and then writes the contents of the file onto drive B using the name  YOURFILE.TXT.  Some parameters or switches are optional, meaning that some parts of the command syn- tax, such as the keyword, are mandatory. When you enter only the mandatory command elements, DOS  in most cases  uses default parameters for other elements.  A good example is the COPY command. If the following is the command, the default target is the currently logged disk and directory: COPY A:MyFile.TXT  If you’re in C:\TEMP, the file is copied to that directory, and the current filename, MYFILE.TXT, is the target filename as well.  As you can see, having defaults makes commands easier to use and shorter, and gives you fewer opportunities to make mistakes.  Because many DOS commands have several parameters, switches, and defaults, different forms of these commands might be correct. You seldom, if ever, use all the optional syntax for any command. Some switches actually are mutually exclusive. You cannot format a flop- py disk as both high density and low density, for example.  To find out what options are available for any given command, you should look up the com- mand in the “Command Reference” later in this book. The first time you look up a complex command, don’t let the sheer volume of optional parameters and switches throw you for a loop. Even the simplest of DOS commands has several options.  The way the syntax is presented often is called the paradigm. Even the simple DOS com- mands have an imposing paradigm. A good example is the DIR command, a real workhorse of a command. Its paradigm looks something like the following: DIR filespec  P  W  S  B  L  C  CH  O:sortorder  A:attributes  You use the DIR command to display a directory of one or more files stored on a disk. This command might look formidable, but it is much easier to understand if you break down the individual components.  ➔ For a description of the DIR command and its options, see “Listing Files with the DIR Command” in  Chapter 8, “Managing Your Files”, p. 193.   Understanding the Elements of a DOS Command  45  The Command-Line Parameters  In addition to the command’s name, a DOS command contains syntax elements known as parameters. Parameters  sometimes called arguments  are the parts of a command line that provide DOS with the objects of the command’s action. The objects might be files, system settings, or hardware devices.  In the DIR example in the preceding section, filespec is the complete filename, including any drive, path, and wildcards that you want the DIR command to use. In some commands, you might see the filespec spelled out, as in the following: d:path\filename.ext  Don’t be confused by this formal rendering of the filespec; it simply states that the  filespec can contain a drive letter, a pathname, a filename, and an extension.  Many new users are confused about the way slashes and backslashes are used in com- mands. In actuality, their uses are stated simply in two rules:    Backslashes  \  are used as separators  delimiters  when specifying directory and file  information.    Slashes    , sometimes called forward slashes, are used as signals to DOS that the  next character is a command-line switch.  A good memory association to use is that a backslash connects one name back to the name that comes before it, whereas a slash connects to the character in front of it.  Part I Ch 3  The Optional Switches  A switch is a parameter that turns on an optional function of a command. Switches are spe- cial parameters because they usually are not the objects of a command’s action; rather, switches modify the command’s action. You can use the  W switch with the DIR command, for example, to display a wide directory of files instead of the usual single-column list. Switches can make a basic command more versatile and powerful. In the DIR example,  P,  W,  S,  B,  L,  O,  C,  CH, and  A are switches.  Usually, you can use a command’s switches in any order or any combination. Not all DOS commands have switches, however. Also, the letter used for a switch in one DOS command might have a different meaning in another DOS command. In addition, some switches require a parameter. You usually attach switch parameters to the switch by using a colon  : , as in the following example: FORMAT A:  F:360  S  In this example, the  F switch specifies that a 360KB floppy disk be formatted in a disk drive that normally uses high-density  1.2MB  disks.   46  Chapter 3 Using DOS Commands  Getting Help  These days, the manuals supplied with DOS don’t provide all the information they did in previous versions. They no longer contain a complete printed reference for all the DOS commands. To get the official Microsoft syntax for every DOS command, you have to pony up extra dollars to buy the MS-DOS Technical Reference. Because you already have this book, you probably don’t want or need the Technical Reference. Appendix F, “Command Reference,” contains a wealth of information about undocumented switches and parameters.  In place of the printed manual that used to come with DOS, Microsoft has opted instead to supply an online command reference. It falls short of the reference in the back of this book, of course, because it doesn’t include the undocumented information; but most of the time, you will find the online reference to be adequate and handy.  To access online help for the use of a particular command, use one of the following proce- dures from the DOS prompt:    Type the DOS command, followed by the switch  ?.   Type HELP, followed by the DOS command.  The following sections describe each method in detail.  Using the Command-Line Help Switch  One DOS command-line switch is never documented in the syntax examples, but you can use this switch with any DOS command. The  ? switch is universal to all DOS commands.  After you enter a DOS command followed by the  ? switch, DOS prints to the screen a summary of the command syntax. In some cases, the sample syntax is simplified by omitting options not available to you at the command line. A good example is the EMM386 command. Usually, EMM386 is loaded via CONFIG.SYS. After DOS is running, only those parts of the command that are accessible during a DOS session are displayed, omitting the parameters that can be given only at boot time.  The handy thing about using the  ? switch is that it gives you a short summary of the com- mand, leaving enough room onscreen for a DOS prompt. This way, you can refer to the syntax and type the command without taking your attention away from the screen.  To get a command summary of the DIR command, for example, type the following command and then press Enter: DIR  ?  DOS displays the command summary help screen shown in Figure 3.1.   Figure 3.1 Using the DOS  command summary help.  Getting Help  47  Displays a list of files and subdirectories in a directory. DIR [drive:][path][filename] to list.

S  B  L  C[H] Switches may be preset in the DIRCMD environment variable.  Override preset switches by prefixing any switch with -  hyphen  -- for example,  -W.  Part I Ch 3  Using the Online Help System  The second method for obtaining help is to use HELP, followed by the keyword you want information about. If you don’t know the keyword you are looking for, just type HELP and you are presented with a list of command keywords from which to choose.  The online help system displays a detailed description of the command’s function, correct syntax, available switches, and a detailed explanation of the effect of each switch.  The online help system also contains special notes and examples related to each command, which enables you to view information on related commands or topics by using only a few keystrokes. If you have a mouse, using the online help system is a snap. You even can print information on selected commands.  To get the complete online help for the DIR command, for example, type the following and then press Enter: HELP DIR  DOS displays the online help screen shown in Figure 3.2.  Navigating the Help System The online help system contains a great deal of information and provides several ways for you to locate, view, and print topics of interest to you. You can use either a mouse or the keyboard to issue commands in the online help system; this section describes both methods. Most of the keystrokes and mouse movements are the same for the help system as they are for the DOS Shell program.  ➔ For more detailed information about moving around a window, see Chapter 4, “Using the DOS Shell,”  p. 57.   48  Chapter 3 Using DOS Commands  Figure 3.2 The DOS online help facility shows syntax, notes, and examples about each DOS  command.  Because the HELP command provides such complete information, information about a topic or command usually requires more than one screen. To view all the information about a topic, you must scroll the display forward and backward.  To scroll through the text one line at a time, use one of the following methods:    Click the downward-pointing scroll arrow in the scrollbar at the right edge of the  screen to move forward one line. To move backward, click the upward-pointing scroll arrow.    Press the Ctrl+down arrow key combination to move forward; press the Ctrl+up arrow  key combination to move backward.  To scroll through the text one screen at a time, use one of these methods:    Click the scrollbar below the scroll box to move forward one screen; click above the    Press the PgDn key to move forward one whole screen; press the PgUp key to move  scroll box to move backward.  backward.  In Figure 3.2, notice the words Notes and Examples near the top-left corner of the screen. Each word is enclosed within solid, triangular characters. Each of these specially marked words is a jump. A jump provides a link to additional information on the currently selected topic or to related topics.  Jumps in the body of the help system’s text are marked with angle brackets    . The brack- ets are colored to help you more easily see them if your video card and monitor support color. Although not shown in Figure 3.2, the word   at the end of the DIR help text is another example of a jump.  When you select a jump, the online help system displays the text related to the topic named by the jump word. To select a jump, use one of the following methods:   Getting Help  49    Click the jump with the mouse.   Move the cursor over the jump and then press Enter.  If you select the   jump shown in Figure 3.2, the help system displays a screen containing examples of the DIR command and explanations of each example. Selecting a jump such as   causes the help system to display the help for the TREE command.  In Figure 3.2, the solid bar across the top of the screen with the words File and Search is the help system’s menu bar. You use the help system’s pull-down menus in the same way you use the pull-down menus in the DOS Shell.  ➔ If you are unfamiliar with using pull-down menus, see Chapter 4, “Using the DOS Shell,” p. 57.  The choices on the File menu enable you to print a topic or exit the online help system. The choices on the Search menu enable you to search for a topic, word, or phrase and repeat the last search.  Another solid bar appears at the bottom of the screen  refer again to Figure 3.2 . The  bottom-right corner of this area of the help screen displays numbers indicating the current line and column number of the cursor. In Figure 3.2, the cursor is at line 1, column 2 of the help text for the DIR command.  At the left edge of this area, three keystroke combinations and their functions are displayed:        Each label enclosed in brackets also doubles as a command button if you have a mouse. You can click the command button or press the key command, Alt+C, causes the online help sys- tem to display its table of contents. Each item in the table of contents is a jump. The Next command, Alt+N, causes the online help system to display the next topic. The Back com- mand, Alt+B, causes the online help system to display the last topic you looked at.  Table 3.1 summarizes the command keys, and their actions, available in the online help  system.

When the help system displays the File menu, click the Print command. The help system opens the Print dialog box shown in Figure 3.3.  ➔ For information on using dialog boxes, option buttons, text boxes, and command buttons, see  Chapter 4, “Using the DOS Shell,” p. 57.

Finally, press Enter or click the OK command button.  Searching for a Topic You use the Find command to search for a specific topic, word, or phrase. The Find com- mand is located on the Search menu.  When the help system opens the Find dialog box, you see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 3.4.  Figure 3.4 The online help sys- tem’s Find dialog box.  Part I Ch 3  When the Find dialog box first opens, the Find What text box contains the word that the cursor was on when you selected the Find command. In Figure 3.4, the cursor was on  the word Notes when the Find command was selected, so the Find What text box con- tains the word Notes.  Enter the topic, word, or phrase that you want to search for in the Find What text box, or use the word already in the text box. Then, select which of the two Find options you want to use. You can use one, both, or neither of these options.  If you check the Match Upper Lowercase option check box, the search is case sensitive. If you check the Whole Word option check box, it is assumed that you are searching for a whole word; partial word matches will be ignored.  You can repeat any search by selecting the Repeat Last Find command on the Search menu or by pressing F3.  Exiting the Help System To exit the online help system using the mouse, pull down the File menu and click Exit. To exit the help system using the keyboard, press Alt+F, followed by X.  Issuing DOS Commands  When you enter a DOS command, two sets of parameters determine how the command is carried out. Any parameters or switches that you explicitly type take precedence, of course, but unless you override them, the default values for a command are used.   52  Chapter 3 Using DOS Commands  Throughout this chapter, you’ve seen the DIR command used as an example. Here’s one more: DIR  P  When you issue the DIR command to see the files on a disk, the currently logged directory is used unless you specify otherwise. Also, all the files in the directory are shown unless you somehow override the default by explicitly specifying a file or group of files. By default, the display of files scrolls to the end without stopping. In the preceding example, the display of all files in the current directory  the default  is used, but the  P switch, which makes the list- ing pause after each page of filenames, overrides the default behavior of scrolling to the end of the list without stopping.  Figure 3.5 breaks down the different elements that make up the DIR command. As you can see, only two of the switches   P and  W  are illustrated.  Figure 3.5 The syntax of the DIR command.  Delimiter  Here, a space  is the delimiter.   DIR d:filename.ext  P W  Command  Parameters  Figure 3.6 is a diagram of the DIR command as you might use it. If you are unfamiliar with the anatomy of a command, the following sections explain each of the different parts.  Editing and Canceling Commands  You occasionally might make a mistake when you are entering a command. Because DOS does not act on the command until you press Enter, you can correct a mistake by using the arrow keys or the Backspace key to reposition the cursor and type over your entry. If you need to insert characters into the command line, press the Ins key to turn on the insert mode. After you press Enter, DOS automatically returns to the overtype mode.  If, however, you have gotten way off track and want to cancel what you have and start over, you can press the Esc key, Ctrl+C, or Ctrl+Break.  DOS stores keystrokes that have not yet been displayed in a type-ahead buffer. The idea of the type-ahead buffer is to keep keystrokes from being lost when entered by fast typists, or when a prolonged operation takes the computer’s focus away from the keyboard for a moment. If the type-ahead buffer gets filled with keystrokes, your PC beeps when you press an additional keystroke, warning you that you are losing keystrokes. The buffer storage areas also give DOS some special editing capabilities.  Each time you complete a command by pressing Enter, the command is stored in another buffer, the last command buffer. Using the DOS editing keystrokes, you can recall the last command, or you can pull the preceding command line from the buffer and use it again. This feature is helpful when you want to issue a command that is similar to the last    command you used or when you mistyped a parameter. Table 3.2 lists the keys you use to edit the input buffer.  Issuing DOS Commands  53  Figure 3.6 Issuing the DIR command.

Type DIR.  Use upper- or lowercase.  Press the spacebar.  2. Type the disk name, followed by a colon if necessary–A:, B:, or C:.  3. Type the name of the files if you want to see the directory listing for a specific file.  4. Type  P to pause the directory 23 lines at a time.  5. Type  W for a wide directory.  6. Press Enter.

Beginning with version 5.0, there is a better way. The DOSKEY command, usually entered via AUTOEXEC.BAT, loads into memory a program that creates a much larger buffer to store previous command lines.  Refer to the “Command Reference” for the DOSKEY listing.  You can recall these commands by pressing the up-arrow key. The DOSKEY buffer is 512 bytes by default, which is enough on average to store the last 20 commands executed.  ➔ For a complete reference source for DOS editing keystrokes, see Appendix D, “DOS and DOS Utility  Programs’ Keyboard Commands,” p. 563.  Using Scroll Control  The term scrolling describes what happens as a DOS screen fills with information. When DOS displays text in response to your typing or as a result of a DOS command, the text fills the screen from left to right and top to bottom. As the screen fills, information scrolls off the top of the display. To stop a scrolling screen, press Ctrl+S  hold down the Ctrl key and then press S . Press any key to restart the scrolling. On enhanced keyboards, press the Pause key to stop scrolling.  Using Wildcards in DOS Commands  Almost everyone has at one time played a game, such as poker, that employs wildcards. If you hear the dealer say “Deuces are wild!” you know that cards having the number 2 printed on the face can be substituted for any other card in the deck.  DOS uses wildcards, too. When you’re entering DOS commands, you can use wildcards to specify groups of files. DOS recognizes two wildcard characters: the question mark  ?  and the asterisk  * , also called star  “star dot star” means *.* .  In DOS commands, the ? represents any single character. The following command produces a directory listing of any files in the currently logged directory that have a filename begin- ning with the letters LTR followed by up to three characters: DIR LTR???.TXT  Also, only those files bearing the extension .TXT match and are listed. Thus, LTR.TXT, LTR0.TXT, LTR01.TXT, LTR001.TXT, LTRMOM.TXT, LTR_32.TXT, and LTR999.TXT are listed, but LTRPOPS.TXT or LTR1001.TXT are not.   Troubleshooting  55  The * represents any string of characters. For example, *.* represents all filenames with any extension, the default scope of the DIR command. The following command lists all files in the currently logged directory having the extension .DOC: DIR *.DOC  The following command lists all the files listed by the DIR LTR???.TXT example, as well as filenames not matched by that form of the command: DIR LTR*.TXT  You should look out for one thing when you’re using the * wildcard, however. The follow- ing command does not produce the result you might expect: DIR *LTR.TXT  This example does not list all the .TXT files whose names end in LTR. Rather, it lists all the files having the extension .TXT. The reason is deceptively simple. Because the * can repre- sent up to eight characters in a filename, any string of characters matches *LTR.  After you get the hang of using wildcards to refine the scope of command parameters that supply filenames, you will find that you are well on your way to becoming a DOS power user.  Troubleshooting  My program won’t run from the C:\ prompt! When you install DOS on your system, by default, the program files for external commands are written to a directory named DOS on the drive letter that your computer boots from. Because most systems boot from drive C, most of the time you’ll find that the DOS directory is called C:\DOS.  If you look into the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you’ll probably find a command line that begins with PATH, followed by a list of directories. This command tells DOS where to search for pro- gram files when it is trying to run a command. If your DOS directory is listed in the PATH command line, COMMAND.COM can find the program files for external commands no matter what disk drive or directory you are logged on to. A PATH statement looks like this: Path=c:\; c:\DOS; c:\windows  If you install a program to a new directory without adding that directory to the PATH state- ment, that program will run only if you change directories to where it resides. When you add the program’s home directory to the PATH statement, you can execute any file in that directory, no matter what directory you are currently in.

The DOS Shell program is a visually oriented user interface that replaces the DOS com- mand line with easy-to-use and easy-to-understand menus. It enables you to use a mouse  or other pointing device  to perform many common DOS tasks.  Introduced with DOS 4.0, the DOS Shell is no longer a primary part of DOS. With the advent of DOS 6.2, it has been relegated to the status of a supplemental program and is thus included on the Supplemental Disk. If you are upgrading from an earlier version of DOS, however, the earlier version of the DOS Shell will remain on your disk.  The DOS Shell is a mildly controversial feature of DOS. Although it is praised by some as a kinder and gentler way of using DOS, others deride it as a crutch and a crippled imitation of Windows. In fact, there is truth to both opinions.  The DOS Shell has features that are strikingly familiar to Windows users. The point-and- click interface, disks and directories displayed in tree format, the capability to associate file- name extensions with the program that produced them so that selecting a file also starts the program—these features are all hallmarks of the popular Windows operating environment. In fact, if your video card permits  EGA and higher , you can run the Shell in graphics mode.  Still, to perform complex tasks, you often are required to enter command lines using the Run option of the File menu. For anything but the most rudimentary tasks, you still are required to know the syntax of DOS commands.  Unlike Windows, which was built from the ground up to be used as a graphical interface, the DOS Shell is mostly text based. Using the extended ASCII drawing characters, the DOS Shell simulates a graphical user interface  GUI . Even when it’s run in graphics mode, the interface changes only slightly.  Many longtime DOS users find the DOS Shell to be restrictive, even though many tasks are easier and quicker when you use the Shell. On the other side of the coin, many new com- puter users, especially those with less than one year’s experience, find the Shell easier to work with than the bare DOS prompt.  Most users who begin their computer careers working with the DOS Shell usually end up doing one of two things. They either discard the Shell, like a worn-out pair of training wheels, or they move on to the Windows environment.  In practice, the DOS Shell has become a tool used by PC support specialists when training newer users. Many MIS departments and support consultants find that if they teach new users the ins and outs of the DOS Shell, they end up fielding fewer support calls from inex- perienced users.  It is assumed that many of the readers of this book fall into the category of support specialist or office computer guru. Although you might not want to use the DOS Shell in your own work, you might want to use it as training wheels for users that you must support.   Starting the DOS Shell  59  With the DOS Shell, you can select many commands from a menu instead of typing the commands on the DOS command line. More significantly, with the DOS Shell, many tasks are greatly simplified. You can search quickly through directories or an entire hard disk for files or groups of files. Using a mouse, you can select and copy files between directories or between disks using a Windows-like drag-and-drop feature.  The DOS Shell also provides features not available at the DOS prompt. You can start one applications program, for example, and then switch to a second application without exiting from the first. Unlike other environments, such as those provided by Windows, QEMM, or 386MAX, however, programs in the background cannot remain active.  The DOS Shell enables you to view the contents of files in ASCII or hexadecimal formats without opening applications programs. Another feature associates specific filename exten- sions with a particular applications program so that selecting a file causes DOS to start the associated program.  To use the DOS Shell effectively, you must have a mouse and mouse driver present on the system. Although you can stumble through the Shell using keystrokes, using a mouse can reduce frustration and save time.  For the mouse to be available, the mouse device driver must be loaded into memory before you run the DOS Shell. DOS 6.0 and later include a generic mouse device driver called MOUSE.COM, which can usually be found in the DOS directory. The mouse driver usually is loaded with a line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file using the LOAD or LOADHIGH command.  Remember that some mouse devices are not Microsoft mouse–compatible and might not work properly with the generic DOS mouse driver. Manufacturers of such mouse devices normally include a special mouse driver for you to use. See the mouse manual for details.  Part I Ch 4  Starting the DOS Shell  After installing the DOS Shell from the Supplemental Programs disk, you can start it by typing the following at the DOS prompt to load the DOS Shell into memory: DOSSHELL  The DOS Shell first displays a copyright notice and then displays the full-screen DOS Shell window.  When the Shell first loads, it also displays a message box in the center of the screen con- taining the message Reading Disk Information. The Shell scans the currently logged drive for the directory structure and file information. After the drive is scanned, the Shell creates a display similar to the one shown in Figure 4.1.   60  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell   cid:0  cid:1  cid:2  cid:3   cid:4  cid:5  cid:6    cid:7  cid:6  cid:8  cid:9  cid:1   cid:10  cid:1  cid:11  cid:11  cid:1  cid:6    cid:12  cid:8  cid:11  cid:10  cid:1   cid:4  cid:5  cid:6    cid:7  cid:8  cid:16  cid:17   cid:7  cid:6  cid:8  cid:9  cid:1   cid:5  cid:6  cid:1  cid:5    cid:13  cid:14  cid:6  cid:15  cid:10  cid:10  cid:4  cid:5  cid:6   Figure 4.1 The initial DOS Shell window in text mode.   cid:19  cid:6  cid:1  cid:5   cid:11  cid:8  cid:11  cid:10  cid:1   cid:4  cid:5  cid:6  cid:16    cid:0  cid:15  cid:3  cid:16  cid:1   cid:18  cid:15  cid:8  cid:2  cid:11  cid:1  cid:6    cid:13  cid:11  cid:5  cid:11  cid:3  cid:16   cid:10  cid:8  cid:2  cid:1   Using the Shell Interface  When you start the DOS Shell, the top line of the screen, the title bar, displays the program name, MS-DOS Shell. The second line of the screen, the menu bar, lists the names of avail- able menus. You can choose all DOS Shell commands from menus that pull down from the menu bar.  Just below the menu bar, the available disk drives are listed, along with a prompt showing the current drive and directory. All types of drives, including CD-ROMs and DoubleSpace drives, are listed.  Initially, the DOS Shell window appears in text mode, as shown in Figure 4.1. See “Using the Shell Screen Modes,” later in this chapter, for information on switching to graphics mode. Figure 4.2 shows the 34-line graphics mode available for VGA displays.  Note that the bitmap icons used to indicate drives also indicate drive types. The icons for a hard disk differ from the icons used to indicate a floppy disk or CD-ROM.  The last line of the DOS Shell window is the status line. The status line usually displays two messages: F10=Actions and Shift+F9=Command Prompt. At the right side of the status line, the Shell displays the current time. Occasionally, the status line also displays other messages related to the command you are executing.  Using Shift+F9 to get a DOS prompt is completely safe when you are working only in DOS. If, however, you want to run the DOS Shell in a DOS session launched under Windows, do not use Shift+F9 to get to a command prompt; otherwise, you can corrupt memory.  The terminology can be confusing, but many programs enable you to “shell out to DOS” or “launch a DOS Shell.” These terms have been in use since early versions of DOS that did not include the DOSSHELL program. DOSSHELL uses different terminology, but the effect is the same.   Starting the DOS Shell  61  Programs that shell out to a DOS prompt do so by launching COMMAND.COM as a second application. Launching COMMAND.COM in this fashion is dangerous under Windows because the normal safeguards Windows uses to ensure memory integrity are bypassed.  Programs that are run under this second COMMAND.COM in a Windows DOS session can allocate memory that is never reclaimed after the program terminates. Worse, programs might try to use memory already in use by Windows or a Windows application. These con- ditions can cause the computer to hang and unsaved data to be lost.  If you need a DOS prompt while you’re working in Windows, always launch a separate DOS session from the Windows Program Manager.  Figure 4.2 The DOS Shell window displayed in graphics screen mode.  Part I Ch 4  Between the drive area and status line, the DOS Shell divides the screen into rectangular windows, each of which is headed by an area title bar. When there is more information than can be displayed in the window, you can scroll up and down using either the keyboard or mouse.  When a window is active, at least one item is highlighted for selection. At the right edge of these windows you find scrollbars. If you press the arrow keys or the PgUp PgDn keys to move the active highlight bar, the scrollbars are relegated simply to showing you the relative position  top to bottom  of the currently highlighted area. Using the mouse is quicker and more efficient. See the section “Moving Around an Area,” later in this chapter, for details about using the mouse interface.  Drive informationis displayed in a pair of windows. The left window displays the directory structure of the disk, and the right window displays the files found in the currently high- lighted directory.   62  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  Using the View menu, you can choose to view two disk drive windows, or you can choose to view Program File Lists. In this view, the bottom window of the display serves as a menu for starting DOS applications and for accessing DOS utility programs. This arealists a group of programs, called a program group. The name of the currently listed program group appears in the area title bar. In text mode, group names are shown enclosed in brackets  refer to Figure 4.1 . In graphics mode, icons indicate single programs and groups. Notice how the icon for Disk Utilities differs from the other icons shown in Figure 4.2. To switch to a group, double-click its icon or highlight the group using the arrow keys and press Enter.  When you choose Enable Task Swapper from the Options menu, a fourth area, the task list area, is displayed in the DOS Shell window. The active task list area displays the names of DOS applications you have activated through the DOS 6.0 task swapper. Figure 4.3 shows the DOS Shell window with the active task list displayed.  Figure 4.3 The DOS Shell window with the active task list displayed.  Selecting an Area  Although several windows can be displayed in the DOS Shell, at any given moment only one area is selected  active  at a time. The selected area is indicated by a highlighted area title bar. An area must be selected before you can perform any operation in that area.  You can use either of the following methods to select an area in the Shell window:    Move the mouse pointer into the area you want to activate and click the left button.  The Shell highlights the area’s title bar.    Press the Tab key to cycle through the areas that are currently displayed in the window.   Starting the DOS Shell  63  Moving Around an Area  After you select an area, the Shell highlights one of the items listed in the area. This high- light is called the selection cursor. To move the selection cursor within the selected area, use one of the following methods:    Use the cursor-movement keys on the keyboard. Press the up- or down-arrow key to move up or down one item at a time. Press PgUp or PgDn to move up or down one page at a time. Press Home or End to go to the beginning or end of the list.    Use the mouse and scrollbar to scroll up or down  see Figure 4.4 . You learn how to use  the scrollbars in the following paragraphs.   cid:0  cid:1  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:4   cid:5  cid:2  cid:2  cid:3  cid:6  cid:7    cid:0  cid:1  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:4   cid:8  cid:3  cid:9   Figure 4.4 Scrollbars are located on the right side of each area of the Shell window.  Part I Ch 4   cid:0  cid:1  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:4  cid:8  cid:5  cid:2   The scrollbar has the following components:    A scroll arrow is located at the top and bottom of the bar. By clicking the scroll arrow, you scroll text up or down one line at a time. Click the scroll arrow and hold down the mouse button to scroll continuously in the direction of the arrow.    A scroll box, sometimes called a thumb, is located on the scrollbar between the up-scroll arrow and the down-scroll arrow. The position of the box on the scrollbar indicates the relative position of the selection cursor with respect to the entire list of items in the selected area.   64  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  Click the scrollbar above the scroll box to move the selection cursor up one page at a time. Click below the scroll box to move down one page at a time.  You can scroll quickly through the list in either direction by clicking the scroll box, holding down the left mouse button, and dragging the box in the direction you want the selection cursor to move.  Using the DOS Shell Menus  You can initiate virtually every DOS Shell operation by choosing options from menus. These DOS Shell menus fall into two categories: the menu bar and pull-down menus.  Using the Menu Bar  When the disk drive area, directory tree area, or file list area is active, the menu bar lists five menu names: File, Options, View, Tree, and Help. The Tree menu name does not appear when the program list or active task list is the active area. Choosing a menu name displays  a pull-down menu.  You can choose a menu option from the menu bar in one of three ways:    Move the mouse pointer to an option and click the left button.   Press the F10 key or Alt key to activate the menu bar. The Shell underlines one letter in each menu name and places a selection cursor on the menu name File at the left end of the menu bar. Press the key that corresponds to the underlined letter in the menu name you want to choose. To choose View from the menu bar, for example, press F10 or Alt and then press V.    Press F10 or Alt to activate the menu bar, use the right- or left-arrow key to move the selection cursor to your choice, and press Enter. This method is sometimes called the point-and-shoot method.  Even after you choose a menu name, you still can choose another menu name by clicking the name or by using the right- or left-arrow key.  Using Pull-Down Menus  When you choose a menu name from the menu bar, the Shell displays a pull-down menu, which displays a list of items below the menu bar. If you choose File, for example, while the file list is the active area, the Shell displays the File pull-down menu shown in Figure 4.5. The items listed in the menu depend on which area is active.  To choose an item from a pull-down menu, use one of the following methods:    Move the mouse pointer to a menu item and click the left button.   The Shell underlines one letter in each menu item. Press the key that corresponds to the underlined letter in the item you want to choose. To choose View File Contents from the File menu in Figure 4.5, for example, press V.   Using the DOS Shell Menus  65  Figure 4.5 The File pull-down menu displayed when the file list area is active.  Part I Ch 4    The Shell places the selection cursor on the first item at the top of the pull-down  menu. Use the up- or down-arrow keys to move the selection cursor to your choice and then press Enter.  When a menu is pulled down, you can display an adjacent menu by pressing the left- or right-arrow key. To cancel a pull-down menu without making a selection, click the menu name, click an area outside the menu, or press Esc. The Shell returns to the preceding win- dow display. You also can press Alt or F10 to cancel a pull-down menu while maintaining an active menu bar so that you can choose another menu name. The DOS Shell uses the fol- lowing conventions when it lists menu items:    A menu item that displays a dialog box, which is discussed later in this chapter, ends  with an ellipsis  … .    A menu item that is dimmed, such as the Create Directory item shown in Figure 4.5, is  not a valid option in the current context.    Some menu items toggle between two states—on or off. A menu item that is toggled on displays a small diamond to the left of the item name. The diamond is absent when the item is turned off.    Some commands that you can select through menu items have shortcuts in the form of  key combinations or keystroke commands. When a keystroke command shortcut is available for a command, the Shell lists the keystroke in the menu, to the right of the command. Five of the commands in the File menu, for example, list shortcut keystroke commands  refer to Figure 4.5 .   66  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  Using Keystroke Commands  The DOS Shell provides many hotkeys. Many of these commands are listed in pull-down menus. Two such commands, F10 and Shift+F9, are listed in the Shell window status line.  Table 4.1 lists all DOS Shell hotkey commands for DOS 6. After you learn these keystroke commands, you might find them quicker to use than any equivalent menu items. Using menus requires that you use multiple keystrokes or that you take one hand from the key- board to use the mouse. To perform a command by using the hotkeys, you press a single keystroke or keystroke combination. Windows users will find many of these hotkeys  familiar.

Any menu item that ends with an ellipsis displays a dialog box when you choose the item. When you choose Copy from the File menu, for example, the Copy File dialog box appears  see Figure 4.6 .  Figure 4.6 The Copy File  dialog box.  Part I Ch 4  Dialog boxes fall into two general categories: those that request information and those that provide information. The Copy File dialog box in Figure 4.6 is an example of a dialog box that requests information. Pressing F1, by contrast, displays a dialog box that provides information and is titled MS-DOS Shell Help  see Figure 4.7 . This help screen assists you in learning the Shell.  All dialog boxes are built from a standard set of elements: text boxes, list boxes, option but- tons, option check boxes, and command buttons. The following sections explain how to use each element.  Using a Text Box When you need to type information in a dialog box, the Shell includes one or more rectan- gular fields known as text boxes. The Copy File dialog box shown in Figure 4.6 contains two text boxes, one labeled From and one labeled To.   68  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  Figure 4.7 The MS-DOS Shell Help dialog box.  To make an entry in a text box, you first highlight the box. Using the mouse, move the mouse pointer to the box and click the left button. Alternatively, you can press Tab or Shift+Tab repeatedly until the text box is highlighted.  Often, the Shell provides a default value in each text box. The text boxes in Figure 4.6, for example, include the default values AUTOEXEC.BAT and C:\. When you select a text box, the Shell highlights any default contained in that text box. Typing new text in the text box replaces the default value.  Sometimes you don’t want to replace the entire default value in a text box. When you want to edit the value, press the right- or left-arrow key to cause the Shell to remove the high- lighting. You then can edit the existing entry.  After you make the desired entry or change the value in the text box, press Enter to accept the value that is displayed in the text box. When you press Enter, the Shell also closes the dialog box and executes the command, if any, with which the dialog box is associated.  Using a List Box Some dialog boxes contain information or a list of choices displayed in a rectangular area, referred to in this book as a list box. A title bar appears at the top of each list box, as well as a scrollbar on the right side of the list box. Refer to Figure 4.7, which shows a help dialog box containing a list box titled File List Overview.  Often the text or list is too long to fit in the list box, so the Shell enables you to scroll verti- cally through the contents of the box. To scroll through a list box, use your mouse and the scrollbar, or use the cursor-movement keys.  Using Option Buttons Some dialog boxes require that you use option buttons  also called radio buttons  to select command settings. Each option button is a circle  a pair of parentheses if your screen is in text mode  followed by a command setting. Option buttons always occur in groups—never alone. The buttons in each group are mutually exclusive; only one button can be selected at a time.   Using the DOS Shell Menus  69  The File Display Options dialog box shown in Figure 4.8, for example, contains option but- tons listed on the right side of the dialog box, beneath the label Sort By. Displayed filenames can be sorted by name, extension, date, size, or disk order, but the Shell does not sort files by more than one of these parameters at a time.  Figure 4.8 The File Display Options dialog box.  Part I Ch 4  You can execute the command associated with a dialog box by pressing Enter, even though the cursor is not in the OK command button  as long as the cursor is not on one of the other command buttons .  To select a different option button, use the mouse to click the desired option button. Alternatively, press Tab or Shift+Tab to move the underscore  cursor  to the group of option buttons. Then, use the up- or down-arrow key to move the dot to the desired button. Press the spacebar to select the new option. Press Enter to close the dialog box and execute the command, if any, with which the dialog box is associated.  Using Option Check Boxes Some Shell dialog boxes enable you to select the desired command settings by “checking” the appropriate option check boxes. An option check box is a pair of brackets followed by a command setting. The File Display Options dialog box in Figure 4.8, for example, contains the following check boxes:    Display Hidden System Files   Descending Order  An option check box turns a command setting on or off. The setting is checked  or on  when an X appears between the brackets. The setting is off when the space between the brackets is blank. To toggle the setting on or off, use the mouse to click between the brack- ets. Alternatively, press Tab or Shift+Tab to move the cursor to the option check box and then press the spacebar. Each time you click the box or press the spacebar,  the option tog- gles on or off.   70  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  Using Command Buttons After you make any desired entries in text boxes, select appropriate option buttons, and check the correct check boxes, you are ready to execute the DOS Shell command. To do so, choose one of the command buttons. Most dialog boxes in the DOS Shell contain three command buttons: OK, Cancel, and Help  refer to Figure 4.8 . The OK command button activates the choices you made in the dialog box and executes the command, if any, with which the dialog box is associated. The Cancel command button aborts any changes you made in the dialog box and returns to the DOS Shell window. The Help command button accesses the Shell’s online help facility.  To execute a command button, use one of the following methods:    Move the mouse pointer to the desired command button and click the left mouse     Press Tab or Shift+Tab to move the cursor to the desired command button and press  button.  Enter.  Modifying the View  The DOS Shell is quite flexible. In the directory tree area and file list area, you can display directories and filenames from any of your computer’s disk drives, including directories and filenames from two disks at one time. You also can display just the program list, change the entire screen to a graphics mode, and show as many as 60 lines of information on a single screen  depending on the capability of your computer’s monitor .  The following sections describe how to modify the display to list directories and files from other disks, to display files from two disks at one time, and to change the amount of infor- mation displayed about each file. In addition, the following sections show you how to dis- play the program list full-screen and how to change the number of lines that appear onscreen.  Logging On to a Different Disk As you learned in Chapter 2, “Starting DOS,” each time you turn on your computer, the operating system  DOS  is loaded from one of your computer’s disks. This disk is the boot disk. If your system is configured to start the DOS Shell immediately after your computer boots up, the Shell window lists directories and filenames found on the boot disk. Often, you might need to display the directories and filenames on a disk other than the boot disk. Figure 4.2, for example, shows three drive letters: A, B, and C. Drive C is the boot disk; therefore, the directories found in drive C are shown in the directory tree. Drive C’s icon  is highlighted, indicating that C is the currently selected disk drive.  To display the directories found on another disk, move the mouse pointer to the drive icon of the desired disk and click the left mouse button. Alternatively, press the left- or right- arrow key until the Shell highlights the drive letter you want and then press Enter.   Using the DOS Shell Menus  71  The Shell displays a message that it is reading the disk information and then displays in the directory tree and file list areas of the DOS Shell window the directories and filenames from the target disk. Figure 4.9, for example, shows filenames from a disk in drive B.  Figure 4.9 Displaying the  directories and file- names from the disk in drive B.  Part I Ch 4  Because the DOS Shell enables you to start other programs that can create, modify, or delete files on your disk, the list of files in the DOS Shell window might at times be inaccu- rate. If you suspect that the directory tree area or file list area does not reflect the actual contents of the disk, use the Shell’s Refresh command. To refresh the file list, press F5 or choose Refresh from the View menu  see Figure 4.10 .  When DOS Shell is run in text mode, there is no visual differentiation between file types. Running the Shell using one of the graphics modes, however, causes file lists to show icons to the left of the listed files. These icons differentiate between executable files and docu- ment files. If you look closely at the icons in Figure 4.9, you see that document files are represented as dog-eared pages and that executable files  .EXE, .COM, and .BAT  have a rectangular icon that represents a running program.  The Shell displays the message Reading Disk Information and then returns to the DOS Shell window and displays the updated list of directories and files in the directory tree and file list areas.   72  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  Figure 4.10 The View menu.  Switching Between Dual and Single File Lists From time to time, you might want the convenience of seeing lists of directories and files from two disks simultaneously. Perhaps you want to copy a file from one disk to another, or maybe you want to compare the list of files on one disk to the list of files on another disk.  The DOS Shell enables you to display two file lists on the same screen. To do so, choose Dual File Lists from the View menu  refer to Figure 4.10 .  The Shell replaces the program list area, at the bottom of the window, with a second disk drive area, directory tree area, and file list area showing the directory tree and file list from the current disk drive  see Figure 4.11 . This view is called a dual file list.  Even though the initial display of the second file list is a duplicate of the top window, each file list is independent of the other. Note that each file list has its own set of disk drive icons. To select a second disk drive in the bottom portion of the window, click the icon in the bot- tom disk drive area for the drive for which you want to list directories and files.  Alternatively, press Tab or Alt+Tab to cycle the selection cursor until it highlights the drive icon of the currently selected drive in the bottom disk drive area. Then use the left- or right-arrow key to highlight the desired drive icon and press Enter.  The Shell lists directories and filenames from the second disk in the lower set of directory tree and file list areas  see Figure 4.12 . You can switch between the two lists by using the mouse or the Tab key.   Figure 4.11 A dual file list.  Figure 4.12 Viewing directories and filenames from two disks at one time.  Using the DOS Shell Menus  73  Part I Ch 4  At times, especially when a directory contains many files, you need a single full-screen file list. Choose Single File List from the View menu to see a list, called a single file list, similar to the one shown in Figure 4.13.   74  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  Figure 4.13 Viewing a single file list.  When you exit from the DOS Shell, it remembers the changes you made using the View menu. The next time you start the Shell, it will have the same appearance.  Displaying All Files Occasionally, you might want the Shell window to display all files on a disk, regardless of the directory. To display all files in a single list, choose All Files from the View menu.  In the All Files view, the Shell displays a window on the right side of the screen listing the names of all files on the disk in alphabetical order  see Figure 4.14 . To the left of this win- dow is an area that displays information about the currently highlighted file.  Switching Between the Program List and the Program File Lists The first time you start the DOS Shell, the DOS Shell window displays the directory tree area, file list area, and program list area. Some users prefer to use the DOS Shell primarily as a menu for starting applications programs and thus don’t want to view the directory tree and file list every time. The DOS Shell, therefore, provides a view that displays only the program list. To select this view, shown in Figure 4.15, choose Program List from the View menu.  If you decide later that you want to display the directory tree and file list areas onscreen along with the program list area, you need only choose Program File Lists from the View menu. The DOS Shell then returns to the original view, with the disk drive area, directory tree area, and file list area in the top half of the screen and program list area in the bottom half of the screen.   Figure 4.14 The All Files view.  Figure 4.15 The full-screen pro- gram list area.  Using the Shell Screen Modes  75  Part I Ch 4  Using the Shell Screen Modes  As you learned previously in this chapter, the DOS Shell window can be displayed as a text representation of a GUI  graphical user interface  or in graphics mode. The number of available screen modes depends on the type of display adapter and monitor you have.   76  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  When you launch DOSSHELL the first time, the Shell window appears in the default 25-line low-resolution text mode. If your video card permits, and most modern ones do, you can choose Display from the Options menu to select from a variety of modes.  If you have a system with video cards that can support more text and graphic modes, you can choose from an array of modes ranging from the default 25-line text mode up to high- resolution graphics modes that display 60 lines of information onscreen. Table 4.2 shows the full list of display modes available.  Table 4.2 Available Video Modes in the DOS Shell Text  Low Resolution  25 lines  Text  Text  Graphics  Graphics  Graphics  Graphics  Graphics  43 lines  50 lines  25 lines  30 lines  34 lines  43 lines  60 lines  High Resolution 1  High Resolution 2  Low Resolution  Medium Resolution 1  Medium Resolution 2  High Resolution 1  High Resolution 2  To change the screen mode, first select the Options menu  see Figure 4.16  and then choose Display. The Screen Display Mode dialog box appears  see Figure 4.17 . Next, highlight a choice in the dialog box, and click OK or press Enter. If you are unsure about your video card’s support for a particular mode, you can choose the Preview button to see what results from that choice.  Figure 4.16 The Options menu.   Figure 4.17 The Screen Display Mode dialog box.  Using the Program List  77  Using the Program List  In addition to providing an alternative DOS interface to the command line, the DOS Shell also provides a convenient method for running all the other programs stored in your com- puter. A program that performs this function is sometimes called a menuing program. The Shell’s program list area provides menuing capability.  Items listed in the program area of the DOS Shell window fall into two categories: program items and program groups. A program item starts a specific software application on your hard disk; a program group is a collection of program items or other program groups.  Program groups enable you to group your applications programs by category. You can cre- ate a Word Processing group, a Database group, and a Spreadsheet group, for example. By default, the initial list of program items, which you see when you first start the DOS Shell, are in the Main program group. The Main group includes another program group named Disk Utilities, which includes program items that perform disk-related DOS commands.  You can easily tell whether an option listed in the program list area is a program item or a program group. When the DOS Shell window is in text screen mode, program group names are enclosed in brackets. For example, the Disk Utilities program group appears as [Disk Utilities] when the screen is in text mode.  In graphics mode, the Shell uses special icons to distinguish between program items and program groups. The following icon appears to the left of program item names:  Part I Ch 4  The following icon appears to the left of program group names:  When you first install the DOS Shell, the program list area lists the program group Main. This group includes the program items Command Prompt, Editor, and MS-DOS QBasic. Selecting a program item starts the selected program. Also included in the Main program   78  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  group is the program group Disk Utilities. Selecting Disk Utilities causes the Shell to dis- play another group of program items, the Disk Utilities group, which consists of DOS  utility programs that enable you to copy, back up, restore, format, and undelete disks  see Figure 4.18 . You can press Esc to return to the preceding program group or select the Main program group, which appears at the top of the program list.  Figure 4.18 Disk Utilities program items.  To run a program item or select an alternative program group, highlight your choice and press Enter, or simply double-click your choice. If you choose to run a program, you are returned to the DOS Shell when that program terminates.  Working with Program Groups  Now that you know what program groups are, you need to learn how you can work with them. The following sections teach you how to add, modify, and delete program groups.  Adding a Program Group To add a new program group, make the program list area the active area of the DOS Shell window and display the program group to which the new group is to be added. If you want to add a new program group to the Main program group, for example, press Esc until the title bar of the program list area displays the title Main. When you want to add a program group to a different program group, use the mouse or cursor-movement keys to select the intended “parent” group in the program list area.   Using the Program List  79  When the program group you want is displayed, complete the following steps:  1. Choose New from the File menu. The New Program Object dialog box appears  see  Figure 4.19 . This dialog box contains two option buttons: Program Group and Program Item.  Figure 4.19 The New Program Object dialog box.  Figure 4.20 The Add Group  dialog box.  2. Click the Program Group option button, and then click the OK command button or  press Enter. The Add Group dialog box appears  see Figure 4.20 . This dialog box con- tains three text boxes: Title, Help Text, and Password. You must type an entry in the Title text box to supply the group name. Entries in the Help Text and Password text boxes are optional.  Part I Ch 4  3. Type a program group title in the Title text box.  You can use up to 23 characters,  including spaces.  This title will be the name, or menu option, that appears in the pro- gram list area when the parent program group is displayed. If you are creating a program group for your database applications, for example, you might type Database Applications in the Title text box. This title appears not only in the program list area, but also in that area’s title bar when a program group is activated. 4. Type a help message, if you choose, in the Help Text text box.  The message can be up to 255 characters long, even though the Shell can display only 20 characters at a time  in the text box; the text in the text box scrolls to the left as you type past the 20th  character.  For a Database Applications group, for example, you might type the help message Displays list of database applications. Afterward, whenever you press F1 while the Database Applications item is highlighted, the help message appears.   80  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  The Shell displays help messages in the Shell Help dialog box and formats the help message to fit in the dialog box. If you want a line to break at a particular point, type the characters ^m  or ^M  at that point. Any following text starts on the next line when the help message is displayed in the Help dialog box.  5. Type a password, if you choose, in the Password text box.  The password can be up to  20 characters long, including spaces.   Using a password to limit access to a DOS Shell program group provides only minimal security. Any user with access to your computer easily can bypass the Shell and start pro- grams from the DOS command line instead.  6. Click the OK command button or press Enter. The Shell adds the new program group  to the selected program group. Now, if you select the new program group, the Shell opens an empty file list area so that you can add program items.  Modifying Program Group Properties After you create a program group, you can change the parameters that define it—its  properties—through the Shell File menu. To change a program group’s properties, highlight the group’s name in the file list area and choose Properties from the File menu. The Program Group Properties dialog box appears  see Figure 4.21 .  Figure 4.21 The Program Group Properties dialog box.  This dialog box essentially is a copy of the Add Group dialog box, except that the title, help message, and password  if you supplied one  for the selected group already appear in the text boxes. Make any changes you want, and then click OK or press Enter. Clicking Cancel returns you to the Shell window without changing any of the program group’s properties.  Deleting a Program Group Through the File menu, you also can remove a program group. Before you delete a pro- gram group, make sure that all items in the group are deleted  see the section “Deleting a Program Item” later in this chapter .   To delete a program group, select the group name and choose Delete from the File menu or press the Del key. The Delete Item dialog box appears  see Figure 4.22 . Select Delete This Item, and click OK or press Enter.  Using the Program List  81  Figure 4.22 The Delete Item  dialog box.  If you attempt to delete a program group before it is empty, the Shell displays an error message box.  Changing the Order of a Group’s Listings Placing the groups that you use most frequently near the top of the group listing is conve- nient, enabling you to find these groups quickly. You can place groups in any order you want. To move a group from one place to another in the menu list, follow these steps:  1. Move the selection bar to the group that you want to move. 2. Choose Reorder from the File menu. The Shell displays the following message in the  status line: Select location to move to, then press Enter. Esc to cancel.  3. Use the cursor-movement keys to move the selection bar to the desired new location  for the selected group and then press Enter. The Shell moves the group to the new position.  You can repeat these steps as often as necessary to produce the order you want for your groups.  Part I Ch 4  Working with Program Items  After you create program groups, you next will want to add program items. The following sections describe how to add program items, as well as how to modify and delete existing program items in the program group.  To reorder program items, follow the procedure described in the preceding section.   Adding a Program Item Adding a program item is similar to adding a program group. When you want to add a pro- gram item to a particular group, make the program list area the active area of the DOS Shell window and then display the program group to which you want to add the program item. If you want to add a program item to the Database Applications program group, for   82  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  example, press Esc until Main appears in the title bar of the program list area and then use the mouse or cursor-movement keys to highlight Database Applications.  After you’ve selected the program group, choose New from the File menu and select Program Item from the dialog box. The Add Program dialog box appears  see Figure 4.23 .  Figure 4.23 The Add Program  dialog box.  This dialog box contains five text boxes: Program Title, Commands, Startup Directory, Application Shortcut Key, and Password. You must type entries in the Program Title and Commands text boxes, but entries in the Startup Directory, Application Shortcut Key, and Password text boxes are optional. All entries in the Add Program dialog box are referred to collectively as the program item’s properties.  You also can click the Advanced command button to add a help message, specify special memory or video requirements, or select other advanced options.  Modifying Program Items Modifying the properties of a program item is fairly easy and straightforward. To modify properties, follow these steps:  1. Activate the program list area. If the group that contains the program item that you want to modify is not included in the selected group, select the program group that includes the item.  2. Use the mouse or cursor-movement keys to move the selection bar to the name of the  program item that contains the properties you want to modify.  3. Choose Properties from the File menu. The Program Item Properties dialog box  4. Make the desired changes in the values in the text boxes. Then click OK or press Enter  appears.  to confirm your choices.  Deleting a Program Item You might want to delete a program item that you no longer use. The program itself is not deleted—only the program item. To remove a program from your computer, you must delete that program’s files from the disk.   Working with Directories  83  To delete a program item, follow these steps:  1. Move the selection bar to the name of the item that you want to delete. 2. Choose Delete from the File menu or press Del. The Delete Item dialog box appears. 3. Select 1. Delete this item. Then click OK or press Enter. The Shell deletes the pro-  gram item from the selected program group list.  Using Shortcut Keys You can specify shortcut keys to start applications. When you specify these key combina- tions, the Shell displays them in the Application Shortcut Key text box in the Add Program dialog box. If you press and hold down Ctrl and Alt simultaneously and then press P, for example, the Shell displays ALT+CTRL+P in the text box.  A specified shortcut-key combination starts the program only if the following three condi- tions are met:    The DOS 6.0 task swapper is enabled.   You started the program through the DOS Shell’s program list area.   You used one of the task-swapper keystrokes  Alt+Tab, Alt+Esc, or Ctrl+Esc  to switch  to another program or back to the Shell.  Suppose that you first enable the DOS Shell task swapper and then start Paradox from the program item in the Database Applications program group. You then switch back to the Shell by pressing Alt+Tab and start WordStar. To return to Paradox quickly, you simply press the shortcut key you defined  for example, Ctrl+Alt+P . The task swapper quickly swaps WordStar to disk and displays the Paradox screen.  Part I Ch 4  When creating shortcut keys, make sure that you are not using key combinations that are already used by DOS Shell.  When you return to the DOS Shell window while the program you were using earlier is swapped out to disk, the Shell lists the shortcut in parentheses to the right of the program item title in the active task list area.  Working with Directories  DOS manages files on your disks by maintaining file information in a hierarchical directory structure. The directory tree area, in the upper-left quadrant of the window, graphically depicts this directory structure. At the top of this area, the root directory of the logged disk is shown as a folder-shaped icon or as a pair of brackets  []  if the DOS Shell is in text mode. All other directories are shown as folder-shaped icons  or pairs of brackets . These other directories are listed below the root icon and connected to the root icon by a vertical line. The name of each directory is listed to the right of its icon.   84  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  At any time during a session with the DOS Shell, one directory name is highlighted. This highlighted directory is referred to as the selected directory. When you first start the Shell, the directory that is current when you start the program is the selected directory  usually the root directory of the boot disk . The file list area of the DOS Shell window, in the upper- right quadrant of the screen, lists the filenames in the selected directory.  Expanding and Collapsing Branches  As you know, the DOS directory structure is treelike. The root directory is like the trunk of a tree, with all other directories growing out like branches of a tree. The DOS Shell graphi- cally represents this treelike nature in the directory tree area of the DOS Shell window as an upside-down tree.  The DOS directory structure can have multiple levels, but initially the Shell shows only the first level of the tree. Each first-level directory—a directory attached directly to the root—is depicted as a branch of the tree. Just as branches of a real tree can have offshoot branches, each DOS directory can contain offshoot directories. The Shell indicates that a directory contains other directories by placing a plus sign  +  in the directory icon. Figure 4.24 shows plus signs in the directory icon for the following first-level directories:    DV    OLD_DOS.1    OPTQEMM  Figure 4.24 Expanding a directory tree branch.  To expand  show the directories subordinate to  by one level a directory tree branch that shows a + in its directory icon, click the + in the directory icon or do the following:   Working with Directories  85  1. Select the directory tree area that contains the target directory icon. 2. Move the selection cursor to the directory name. 3. Press the + key, or choose Expand One Level from the Tree menu.  The Shell then shows the next level of directories beneath the selected directory. Figure 4.25, for example, shows the expanded DATABASE directory containing three second-level directories: ACCESS, DBASE, and PARADOX.  Offshoot directories can contain more offshoots. The relationship among directory levels is analogous to a family tree—child, parent, grandparent, and so on. When a second-level directory contains one or more third-level directories, the Shell shows a plus sign  +  in the second-level directory icon. The directory icon of the PARADOX directory shown in Figure 4.25, for example, indicates that this branch of the DATABASE directory also contains at least one directory. To expand one level of the PARADOX branch, follow the procedure you used to expand one level of the DATABASE branch.  If you do not remember precisely where a directory is located in the directory tree, expand- ing branches one level at a time can become tedious. When you want to expand all levels beneath a particular directory branch, use the following procedure:  1. Use the mouse to click the directory name or use the arrow keys to move the selection  cursor to the directory name.  2. Press the * key, or choose Expand All from the Tree menu.  The Shell expands all levels of the tree below the currently selected directory. Figure 4.25, for example, shows the fully expanded DATABASE branch of drive C’s directory tree.  Part I Ch 4  Figure 4.25 The fully expanded DATABASE branch.   86  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  The opposite of expanding a directory branch in the directory tree area is collapsing a branch. When you first start the DOS Shell, you might notice that a root directory’s icon contains a minus sign  – . After you expand a directory branch, the icon for the expanded branch also contains a minus sign. These minus signs are a reminder that you can collapse the branch. To collapse a branch whose icon contains a minus sign, click the directory icon with your mouse or use the following procedure:  1. Select the directory name. 2. Press the –  hyphen  key or choose Collapse Branch from the Tree menu.  To collapse the entire tree, click the root directory icon or do the following:  1. Select the root directory name at the top of the directory tree. 2. Press the –  hyphen  key or choose Collapse Branch from the Tree menu.  The Shell collapses the entire tree down to the root level and places a + in the root  directory icon.  Creating Directories  Because the only automatically available directory on a DOS disk is the root, you must add any additional directories. Even after you establish a workable directory structure for your computer, you occasionally need to create new directories on your disks. DOS enables you to add directories to a disk through the DOS Shell, instead of having to exit to a command prompt to add directories.  To create a new directory using the DOS Shell, do the following:  1. Select the directory tree area of the DOS Shell window. 2. Select the directory to be the parent of the new directory. 3. Select File from the menu bar to display the File menu. 4. Choose Create Directory from the File menu.  The Shell displays the Create Directory dialog box shown in Figure 4.26. This dialog box indicates the name of the parent directory, C:\SPREADSH.  Figure 4.26 The Create Directory dialog box.  5. Type the name of the new directory, and press Enter or click OK.   Working with Files  87  The Shell creates the new directory and returns to the directory tree area of the DOS Shell window. The Shell also adds to the tree an icon for the new directory.  Working with Files  In the DOS Shell, you perform file-management operations primarily through the File menu. The active menu options displayed in the File menu, however, vary according to which area of the window is active. Although the menu options displayed when the directory tree is active are the same as the options displayed when the file list is active, many of these menu options are dimmed  not valid  when the directory tree is active.  The DOS Shell’s file-management commands operate on all selected files. At any time, you can select any number of files. The Shell displays both the name and file-list icon of each selected file in reverse video. Selected files need not be from the same directory.  Selecting a Single File  To select a single file, follow these steps:  1. Activate the directory tree area. 2. Use the mouse and scrollbar or the cursor-movement keys to scroll through the direc- tory tree until the name of the directory containing the files you want to select appears.  3. Use the mouse or arrow keys to move the selection cursor to the target directory. 4. Activate the file list area. 5. Use the mouse and scrollbar or the cursor-movement keys to scroll the file list until the  Part I Ch 4  name of the file you want to select appears.  6. Click the name of the file to be selected  the target file . Alternatively, use the cursor-  movement keys to move the selection cursor to the target file and then press the  spacebar.  To indicate that a file is selected, DOS displays the filename and file list icon in reverse video.  A file is not selected until the icon is displayed in reverse video. Simply highlighting the file- name with the selection cursor is not sufficient to select the file.  Selecting Multiple Files  If you want to apply a DOS Shell command to several files, applying the command simulta- neously to all the files is more efficient than applying it to one file at a time. After you select the first file, you can select the other files in either of the following ways  this procedure is referred to in the DOS Shell as extending the selection :   88  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell    Hold down the Ctrl key and click the name of the file that you want to select.   Press Shift+F8. When the message ADD appears in the status bar, move the selection   cursor to the name of the file you want to select and then press the spacebar. Press Shift+F8 again to turn off the ADD message.  The icon and filename of each selected file appear in reverse video  see Figure 4.27 .  Figure 4.27 Selecting several files in the DOS Shell.  Frequently, you might want the Shell to work on several files that are listed one after the other in the list area. To select contiguous files, you can select each file individually, using the previously discussed method. But the Shell provides an easier way to select files as a group.  To select contiguous files in the DOS Shell, follow these steps:  1. Select the first file. 2. Use one of the following procedures to select the remaining files:    Use the mouse to position the pointer on the last file you want to select, press the  Shift key, and click the left mouse button.    While holding the Shift key, use the cursor-movement keys to move the selection  bar to the last file.  The Shell selects all the files. To indicate that these files are selected, the Shell displays the filenames and their icons in reverse video.   Working with Files  89  Selecting All Files  To select allthe files in a directory, follow these steps:  1. Select the directory in the directory tree area. 2. Activate the file list area. 3. Press Ctrl+ , or choose Select All from the File menu.  Deselecting All Files  After you select files, you might decide that you don’t want to perform a DOS Shell opera- tion on that group of files. Perhaps you want to start a fresh selection process by deselecting all selected files. Normally, selecting a different directory also deselects all selected files.  You also can deselect all selected files in one procedure. Use the mouse to click anywhere in the file area or press the spacebar. Alternatively, choose Deselect All from the File menu.  Selecting Files Across Directories  By default, the DOS Shell enables you to select files in only one directory at a time. By selecting a different directory, you deselect all selected files. Occasionally, however, you might want to perform a file-management operation on files from several directories. You might want to copy to a floppy disk, for example, one file from each of three directories on your hard disk.  Before you can select files in several directories, you must choose Select Across Directories in the Options menu.  To copy files from three directories to a floppy disk in one procedure, you must first select the directories and then the files, one at a time. Then, choose the Copy command from the File menu to copy all the selected files to the floppy disk.  Part I Ch 4  Copying Files in the Shell  With the DOS Shell, you can copy one or more files in a directory, between directories, or between disks, using any of several approaches. The approach described in this section—the dual file list method—is the quickest and easiest to learn and use.  To perform the copy operation using the dual file list method, you first must select the source and target drive and directory and create a dual file list. Complete the following steps:  1. Select the source drive and directory  those that contain the files you want to copy . 2. Choose Dual File Lists from the View menu to switch to the dual file list.  Under certain specific circumstances, you can skip step 2. For example, you can drag selected files to another directory on the same disk without opening a dual file list. Completing this step, however, always produces the result that you want.   90  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  3. Use the mouse or the cursor-movement keys to select the target drive and directory in  4. Use the mouse or keyboard to select, in the first  upper  file list, the files that you want  the second directory tree.  to copy.  The remaining steps for completing the copy operation differ, depending on whether you want to use the mouse or the keyboard. If you use a mouse, complete the following steps:  1. Position the mouse pointer on a selected file in the upper file list. Hold down the Ctrl key while you press and hold the left mouse button. While holding down both the Ctrl key and the mouse button, drag the mouse pointer to the target drive letter in the lower drive area or, alternatively, to the target directory’s name in the lower directory tree. When you begin to drag the mouse, the pointer changes from an arrow  or a block, in text mode  to a circle  or two exclamation-point symbols, in text mode . When the pointer enters the second directory tree, the circle becomes a file icon  or a diamond,  in text mode . If you are copying several files, the file icon resembles a stack of three papers. Figure 4.28 shows how you should have the dual file lists set up before dragging the filenames to copy them to the target disk.  Figure 4.28 Using the dual file list display to copy files.  When you are copying files to a different disk, you don’t have to hold down the Ctrl key; holding down the mouse button is enough. If you drag files to another directory on the same disk without holding down the Ctrl key, however, the Shell assumes that you want to move the files rather than copy them.   Working with Files  91  Depending on the selections you have made in the Confirmations Item dialog box, which can be accessed from the Options menu, you might be asked to confirm the copy operation.  2. To confirm that the copy should take place, click Yes.  To copy files using the keyboard only, complete the copy procedure by following these steps:  1. Choose Copy from the File menu or press F8. The Shell displays the Copy File dialog  box. This dialog box contains the From and To text boxes. The Shell lists the source files in the From text box and the source directory in the To text box.  2. Type the target drive and directory name in the To text box and then press Enter. The Shell copies the files to the target directory and displays a message to that effect in the center of the screen.  Moving a File in the Shell  When the DOS Shell moves a file, the program copies the file from one storage location to another and then deletes the file from its original location. Therefore, the steps for moving one or more files with the DOS Shell are nearly the same as those for copying files. When you want to move one or more files, select the files to be moved just as you do if you are going to copy them.  If you are using a mouse, position the mouse pointer on one of the selected files in the upper file list. Hold down the Alt key while you press and hold down the left mouse button. While holding both the Alt key and the mouse button, drag the mouse pointer to the target drive letter in the lower drive area or to the target directory’s name in the lower directory tree.  To move files using only the keyboard, follow these steps:  1. Choose Move from the File menu or press F7. The Shell displays the Move File dialog  box. This dialog box contains the From and To text boxes. The Shell lists the source files in the From text box and the source directory in the To text box.  2. Type the target drive and directory name in the To text box, and then click OK or press  Enter. The Shell moves the files to the target directory and displays a message to that effect in the center of the screen.  Part I Ch 4  Using the Shell to View a File  When you want to view the contents of a file from within the DOS Shell, follow these steps:  1. Select the target file in the file list area. 2. Choose View File Contents from the File menu.   92  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  When the file you want to view contains only ASCII characters, the Shell displays the ASCII file viewer. One of the files distributed with DOS 6.0, for example, is named  APPNOTES.TXT and contains only ASCII text. To view the contents of APPNOTES.TXT, select  its name in the file list area and then choose View File Contents from the File menu.  The Shell displays the file in the ASCII viewer  see Figure 4.29 .  Figure 4.29 The ASCII viewer.  To scroll through the file, use the cursor-movement keys or use the mouse to click the labels PgUp, PgDn, ↑, or ↓, which are displayed near the top of the window.  When the file you want to view contains data other than ASCII characters, the DOS Shell uses the hexadecimal  base 16, often referred to as hex  viewer. If you select the DOS com- mand processor file, COMMAND.COM, and press F9, for example, it displays the contents of the file as four columns of hexadecimal codes and one column of ASCII characters.  This infor- mation normally has meaning only to programmers and to the computer.  As in the ASCII viewer, you can scroll through the file by using the cursor-movement keys or the mouse.  Associating Files with Programs  Many programs create and work with files that have distinctive filename extensions. The DOS Shell enables you to associate particular extensions with a specific program so that you can start the program and load a file with an associated extension in one step.  The easiest method of associating a file extension with a program is to follow these steps:  1. In the file list area, select a file whose extension you want the Shell to associate with   a specific program.   Using the Task Swapper  93  2. Choose Associate from the File menu. The Shell displays the Associate File dialog box, containing a text box in which you can type the program’s directory path and filename. If the current file extension already is associated with a program, the Shell displays the program’s path and filename in the text box.  3. In the text box, type the program’s complete filename, including the extension. If the  file is in a directory that’s not included in the PATH statement, type the directory path as well as the filename.  4. Click OK or press Enter.  Program associations are stored in an ASCII file called DOSSHELL.INI. You can use any text editor, including the DOS Editor, to edit this file.  Using the Task Swapper  The DOS Shell also has the capability to load more than one program at a time. DOS accomplishes this feat through a technique called task swapping. To activate this feature, choose Enable Task Swapper from the Options menu. The Shell adds an active task list area to the window  see Figure 4.30 . Initially, nothing is listed in this area because no program  other than the Shell  is active.  Part I Ch 4  Figure 4.30 The DOS Shell window with an active task list area.  With the task swapper enabled, you still start programs by using any of the methods described earlier in this chapter. But after you start a program, you can jump back to the DOS Shell instantly without exiting the program. Simply press Alt+Esc or Alt+Tab, and the   94  Chapter 4 Using the DOS Shell  screen returns to the DOS Shell window, where the program  or associated data file  is listed in the active task list area. DOS has swapped the contents of memory  RAM  to disk, freeing space in memory so that you can run another program.  The fastest way to switch between active tasks is to hold down the Alt key and tap the Tab key. Do not release the Alt key. The Shell displays the name of the task at the top of the screen. Still holding down the Alt key, press the Tab key again to see the name of the next task. Repeat this keystroke until the target task name appears. Finally, release the Alt key. The Shell switches to the target task.  Project: Using the Help System  At any time during a DOS Shell session, pressing the F1 key causes a help window to appear. Online help assists you with the current selection or action so that you can make an informed selection.  The help system is contextual, meaning that DOS looks at the menu item currently high- lighted and provides information about that selection. You can go from that help screen to other help screens to get help on additional topics. Figure 4.31 shows a typical help screen.  Figure 4.31 The Changing Colors help screen.  Five command buttons appear at the bottom of a help screen:    Close returns you to the screen from which you pressed F1.   Back returns to the preceding help screen.   Keys displays an index of help information on keystroke commands.   Index displays the DOS Shell help index, a list of topics on which you can receive help.   Help displays information on how to use the help system. Use the mouse and scrollbar  or the cursor-movement keys to display the information in which you are interested.  Additional related topics are listed in a different color on the help screen. Use the Tab key to highlight the related topic and press Enter, or click the topic. The Shell displays another help screen.   Project: Using the Help System  95  Choose the Close command button or press Esc to return to the screen from which you pressed F1.  Operating techniques are fairly consistent throughout the DOS Shell, and because the Help information is quite thorough, you should be able to learn what isn’t covered by selecting the menu items and using the Help feature to guide you.

This chapter introduces you to the fundamental ways in which DOS handles these roles. To provide data storage and retrieval, the operating system must provide a common method for ﬁle storage and retrieval so that any software package can access information easily and quickly. It is also important that DOS provide these services without your having to know the internal details of how the disk works and why.  DOS generally insulates you from the technical details involved in storing and retrieving data on your computer. You must, however, prepare disks by formatting them, and you might occasionally have to repair them. In this chapter, you learn information about the most basic part of DOS—the ﬁle and directory system. After you’ve mastered this informa- tion, you will have a ﬁrm footing for understanding DOS completely.  Ask almost any non–computer user what a ﬁle is, and he or she almost invariably describes  a collection of papers wrapped in a manila folder. Such ﬁles are typically stored in ﬁle cabi- nets.  On a computer, a ﬁle system is an organized collection of ﬁles that has a direct parallel to the old, familiar ﬁle cabinet. The hard disk and ﬂoppy disks you use to store data electronically use many of the same conventions. Each ﬁle on a disk has a unique name, just as each ﬁle folder in a ﬁle cabinet is labeled for identiﬁcation. Files are arranged on your disks in direc- tories  discussed later in this chapter  to make them easier to ﬁnd, just as sections in a ﬁle cabinet are organized into group ﬁle folders that have a common purpose.  Understanding Files  A ﬁle is a variable-length collection of related information that is referenced by a name. Just as a ﬁle folder can be ﬁlled with various papers that contain information in the form of writ- ing, an electronic ﬁle can contain various pieces of related information wrapped up in an electronic ﬁle folder referenced by the ﬁle’s name.  Files written to disk can serve many purposes. A word processor ﬁle might hold all the sen- tences in a letter or book chapter. A database ﬁle might contain the names and addresses of all the members of a club or all the invoices for a store. Just as a good secretary uses color- coded labels and different markings on ﬁle folders to indicate the type of information in a ﬁle, DOS ﬁlenames most often indicate what kind of information they hold.  Often the way data is written in a ﬁle depends on the software that creates it. You can type the same letter, using all the same words and punctuation, using Microsoft Word and WordPerfect. When printed, the letters are identical, yet the format of the ﬁles created by these two programs is very different. You can, with a little work, use Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3 to store the same letter in yet another ﬁle format.  Although many programs recognize one another’s ﬁle formats and convert them for you, DOS cares little about the format of a ﬁle’s content. DOS doesn’t bother trying to decipher the contents of a ﬁle. Its job is to wrap the information in a ﬁle folder  the ﬁle’s name  and   Introducing the DOS File System  101  put it where you can ﬁnd it later. Your job is to know what the ﬁle contains and which pro- gram you need to use to access correctly the data contained in the ﬁle.  In a computer setting, a ﬁle can contain data  information , programs  instructions that guide computer tasks , or both. A ﬁle can exist on a disk, on magnetic tape, on CD-ROMs, or even in a computer’s memory. Files are made up of elements of data or programs. The individual elements can be stored as patterns of holes in a paper tape, as patterns of mag- netic ﬁelds on the surface of a disk, and in many other ways.  Fortunately, unless you write programs for a living, you usually can ignore the technical aspects of how a ﬁle is stored. After all, you don’t have to know how a fuel injector works to drive a fuel-injected car.  Physical storage techniques for ﬁles vary greatly, but on PCs a few ﬁle storage methods dominate. On PCs, ﬂoppy disks are used primarily for distributing ﬁles to other computers. Hard disks provide long-term and working storage. CD-ROMs often are used for storing ﬁles that do not need to be edited or altered, and tape drives and ﬂoppy disks are used to make backup copies of ﬁles for safekeeping.  Regardless of the actual media  ﬂoppy, hard disk, tape, and so on , DOS uses ﬁlenames to identify ﬁles. As you might remember from an earlier chapter, a full ﬁlename consists of one to eight characters followed by a period  .  and up to three characters called the extension. The period and extension are optional but are used almost universally.  The name portion of a ﬁlename  before the period  usually provides a mental picture or description of the contents of the ﬁle. Extensions, on the other hand, traditionally describe the type of ﬁle—its format.  If you’re using a word processing application to write a memo, you might use as the name portion of a ﬁlename the name  or a close approximation  of the person who will receive the memo. You then can use the extension .MEM to indicate that the ﬁle is a memo. You can call a memo to Mr. Fleenor, for example, FLEENOR.MEM. Similarly, you can use the extension .DOC for ofﬁce-policy document ﬁles. A monthly policy statement for January can be named JAN.DOC.  DOS enables you to use a wide variety of ﬁlenames. You are free to develop your own ﬁle- naming conventions, provided that you stay within the character limits imposed by DOS and the requirements of the software you use to create the ﬁle. Although most software packages are lenient in the ﬁlenames they can use, many programs require a ﬁle to have a speciﬁc extension before they recognize the ﬁle as one of their own  Understanding Filenames  DOS ensures that every one of your ﬁles has a name. In fact, DOS does not provide a way to put ﬁle data on a disk without a ﬁlename. When a ﬁle is created, either by your software or a DOS ﬁle service routine, information about the physical location of the ﬁle is stored in a File Allocation Table  FAT , which is similar to a book’s table of contents. DOS places the  Part II Ch 5   102  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  name of each ﬁle and its attributes in a special structure called a directory, which you can think of as the chapter headings of a book. Using this analogy, you can think of ﬁles as the pages in each chapter.  For now, however, you need only concern yourself with the names of ﬁles. You learn more about the other parts of the DOS ﬁle system later in this chapter. Keep in mind that a direc- tory is a special structure used to store ﬁlenames and ﬁles. Later in this chapter, you learn more information about the directory.  Creating Filenames The characters you see on your computer screen are the ASCII code representations of bytes of data. One character is stored in one byte. In a disk directory, each slot where a ﬁle- name can be stored reserves a space 11 bytes long  8 for the ﬁrst part of the ﬁlename plus 3 for the extension . DOS accepts for ﬁlenames most characters that you use for “everyday” names. You can use the uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z; DOS automatically stores letters in uppercase in a directory entry. You also can use the numeric characters 0 through 9 and many punctuation characters not used as separators in the ﬁle system.  Following are the rules for creating legal ﬁlenames:    Each ﬁlename on a disk must be unique.   Filenames, even though they are not always expressed that way, include the drive letter  and directory path of the ﬁle. In practical terms, this naming convention means that each ﬁle in a directory must have a unique name because the difference in directory names adds to a ﬁlename’s uniqueness.    A ﬁlename consists of the following items:    A name of one to eight characters   An optional extension of one to three characters   A period between the name and the extension  if an extension is used     The following characters are allowed in a ﬁlename:    The letters A through Z  lowercase letters are transformed into uppercase auto-  matically     The numerals 0 through 9   The following special characters and punctuation marks:  $  & @ !     - { } ‘_ ~ ^ ‘    DOS reserves certain ASCII codes for other uses and does not let them be a part of the  ﬁlename. The following characters are not allowed in a ﬁlename:    Any control character  ASCII codes used as commands    The space character   The following special characters and punctuation symbols:  =   [ ] “ : ; , ? * \      Introducing the DOS File System  103  To understand why DOS disallows the use of some characters in ﬁlenames, you must look below the surface of DOS. Certain characters are not allowed because DOS does not pass those characters from the keyboard to the command or external command program that controls a ﬁle’s name. You cannot, for example, use the Ctrl+G  ^G  character in a ﬁlename because Ctrl+G tells an input device to sound the computer’s bell or beep signal. DOS does not accept the Escape character, produced by the Esc key, as part of a ﬁlename because DOS interprets the Esc key as your request to cancel the command line and start again.  Another example of an unacceptable character is Ctrl+S  ^S , which DOS and other operat- ing systems use to stop the ﬂow of characters from the input device to the output device. Ctrl+S stops screen scrolling, for example. If you press Ctrl+S while entering a ﬁlename, DOS assumes that you are entering an input-stopping character, not part of a ﬁlename.  You cannot use in a ﬁlename any characters that COMMAND.COM and external command pro- grams use to divide the parameters and switches from the command in a command line. Because DOS must parse  distinguish the various components of  the command line, certain characters are seen as delimiters of parameters or as parts of a parameter. The backslash character  \ , for example, separates directory names in a path speciﬁer. DOS always reads a backslash in a command line as part of a path.  Avoiding Reserved Names One of the ways in which DOS is able to control so many different types of devices is by using a logical device. It is important to understand that each of these devices has a name that is reserved and cannot be used for other purposes.  In theory, DOS treats all the input and output devices it controls as if they were made out of software. Such devices include almost everything you think of as belonging to a computer system—disks, printers, keyboards, screens, and modems.  The PC manufacturers are responsible for accepting and generating data in a fashion that conforms to DOS standards. The actual control over the actions of a device  print heads, disk drive motors and heads, and so on  is left to programming contained on ROM chips incorporated into the devices. Thus, DOS needs to know only that a printer exists and that the printer is connected to the system in a speciﬁc way, normally via a parallel or serial port.  To you, a parallel port is a hardware connector where you plug in a cable. To DOS, the par- allel port is simply an address in memory where it sends and receives data. Each of these addresses is called a logical device and is given a name. By default, DOS expects to see a printer connected to the ﬁrst parallel port, which it calls LPT1.  The ﬁrst available disk is A:. By convention, B: is reserved for the second ﬂoppy disk, and C: is reserved for the ﬁrst hard disk volume. The keyboard and video card are combined to cre- ate a logical device named CON:.  Notice that all these logical device names end with the colon  : . The colon signiﬁes that something is a DOS logical device. In some contexts, however, the colon is omitted, as in this example: COPY CON SUMFILE.TXT  Part II Ch 5   104  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  This variation of the COPY command tells DOS to take input from the console  CON:  and save it to the currently logged drive and directory as a ﬁle having the name SUMFILE.TXT.  What does all this talk of logical devices have to do with ﬁlenames? Simply, DOS’s internal routines treat logical devices like ﬁles in many ways. That’s why when you try to name a ﬁle with a name for a logical device, DOS gets confused and weird things can happen, such as losing data or sending a ﬁle to a printer.  For this reason, DOS reserves names for its logical devices. DOS can treat some of these log- ical PC devices in a high-level way by accepting their names as input or output parameters in a command line, as in the preceding example. Before it uses the ﬁlename parameters in a command line to look for a ﬁle, DOS checks to see whether the ﬁlename is a device name. Table 5.1 lists the major logical DOS input and output device names and their purposes.  Table 5.1 DOS Device Names  Device Name COMx or AUX LPTx or PRN CON  NUL  Purpose Identiﬁes a serial communication port  x can be the number 1, 2, 3, or 4 . Identiﬁes a parallel printer port  x can be the number 1, 2, 3, or 4 . Identiﬁes the screen and keyboard. Identiﬁes the “do nothing” device, also called a bit bucket. Output sent to NUL is not displayed, stored, or acted on in any way.  CLOCK$  Provides date and time services.  Never attempt to write a disk ﬁle with a name that is the same as one of the device names listed in Table 5.1. DOS intercepts the device name, even if you add an extension, and tries to use the device—not the ﬁle you intend—to complete the command. Use a device name only as a device parameter in a command.  Observing File-Naming Conventions  A convention is an informal rule that is not explicitly enforced. DOS ﬁlenames often follow certain conventions. Although you can use any ﬁlename that follows DOS’s character and device-name rules, observe DOS ﬁle-naming conventions whenever possible. You can, for example, name a memo ﬁle and give it a BAT extension, but this extension has a special meaning to DOS because all batch ﬁles have the extension BAT. As long as you do not try to execute the memo as a batch ﬁle, DOS is happy. If you try to execute the memo ﬁle, how- ever, DOS sees the BAT extension and tries to execute it. Of course, the memo cannot be executed because it probably isn’t made up of legal DOS commands.  You can name an EXE ﬁle with a COM extension. Although both ﬁles are executable, they have internal differences. DOS does not take the extension’s name to mean that the ﬁle is indeed an EXE or COM ﬁle; DOS inspects a key part of the ﬁle before deciding how to load and exe- cute the program ﬁle. If you name a spreadsheet ﬁle as an EXE or COM ﬁle, for example, DOS   Introducing the DOS File System  105  is not fooled into executing the nonprogram ﬁle. In all likelihood, your system simply will lock up, and you will have to perform a warm boot to begin again.  Many software manufacturers use certain extensions for special ﬁle formats created by their applications. To avoid confusion about the contents of a ﬁle, avoid using those extensions. Table 5.2 lists some conventional ﬁlename extensions and their meanings. Multiple pro- grams can use the same extensions in their ﬁle-naming conventions.

This entry maintains critical information about the ﬁle and where it is stored on disk. One of the pieces of information maintained in the directory entry is called the ﬁle attribute ﬁeld. This one-byte ﬁeld stores a number of characteristics about each ﬁle but is not dis- played in a normal directory listing. Each characteristic stored in the ﬁle attribute ﬁeld is called a ﬁle attribute, and each ﬁle can have more than one ﬁle attribute. Each ﬁle attribute is   108  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  represented in the attribute byte by a single bit, often called an attribute bit. Table 5.3 lists the attributes and their purposes in DOS. You can view and modify most attribute bits by using the ATTRIB command; DOS manages some attribute bits directly.  Table 5.3  File Attributes and Their Meanings  Attribute Bit Archive  Hidden  Read-only  Subdirectory  System  Volume Label  Meaning When DOS writes to a ﬁle, it sets the Archive attribute on. Some DOS commands such as MSBACKUP and XCOPY remove this attribute from ﬁles. Files having the Archive attribute have been altered or created since the last time they were archived.  This ﬁle is bypassed by most DOS ﬁle-managementcommands and does not appear in a directory listing. Hidden ﬁles, however, are listed by the DOS Shell in the ﬁle list area.  This file can be accessed for information but cannot be erased or modi- ﬁed.  Note that you can erase a read-only ﬁle by using the DOS Shell.   This attribute identiﬁes the entry as a directory rather than a standard ﬁle.  This file is a DOS system ﬁle.  This entry is the volume label for a disk. The entry does not identify an actual ﬁle.  The Archive attribute works with DOS ﬁle-management commands to determine which ﬁles the commands process. The MSBACKUP command resets the Archive attribute of any ﬁle it copies to disk. As you work with the ﬁles on your disk, each ﬁle on which DOS performs a write operation gets ﬂagged with the Archive attribute, which signals that the ﬁle has changed since it was last archived. If you have a recent full-disk backup, you can create a backup of only the ﬁles that have changed since the last backup by telling MSBACKUP that you want to copy only ﬁles having the Archive attribute.  A ﬁle entry with the Hidden attribute turned on is “invisible” determineto most DOS ﬁle- management commands. Hidden ﬁles have ﬁlenames and extensions like normal user ﬁles but are not processed by the DIR and COPY commands. The two DOS system ﬁles on the boot disk are examples, as are the ﬁles that manage a DoubleSpace drive.  You can detect the presence of hidden ﬁles by using the ATTRIB or CHKDSK command. Using ATTRIB, you also can list hidden ﬁles. CHKDSK merely indicates the number of hidden ﬁles on the disk.  The Subdirectory attribute indicates to DOS that the entry is not intended for a user ﬁle but for an additional directory called a subdirectory. When it carries out ﬁle-management commands, DOS knows to bypass a ﬁle with the Subdirectory attribute turned on.  The System attribute indicates that a ﬁle is an operating system ﬁle. The two DOS system ﬁles have this attribute in addition to the Hidden attribute. You need not worry about the System attribute; it does not affect your DOS work.   Introducing the DOS File System  109  The Volume Label attribute indicates that the directory entry involved is to be used as the name of the volume, not as a ﬁlename. DOS then combines the ﬁlename and extension ﬁelds to provide an 11-character volume label for the disk. Only a Volume Label entry can have this attribute set  turned on .  The Archive, Hidden, Read-only, and System attributes are the only attributes you can change directly through DOS. DOS controls the other attributes without your intervention.  Changing File Attributes with the ATTRIB Command DOS’s ATTRIB command provides the means to change the settings of the Archive, Read- only, Hidden, and System attributes. The syntax of the ATTRIB command is ATTRIB [+R-R] [+A-A] [+S-S] [+H-H] filespec [ S]  If you issue the ATTRIB command with no parameters, you get a list of all the ﬁles in the cur- rent directory, along with a display of their attribute status. Figure 5.1 shows a typical result.  Figure 5.1 The ATTRIB display when no parameters are given.  H:\TEST>ATTRIB  A          H:\TEST\CONFIG.MEM A          H:\TEST\FM_LETS.DBF A          H:\TEST\FM_LETS.DBT A    R     H:\TEST\GROUND.DBF A    R     H:\TEST\GROUP.DBF A    R     H:\TEST\GUEST.DBF A    R     H:\TEST\GUEST.LBL A          H:\TEST\HOTEL.DBF A          H:\TEST\HOT_COMM.DBF A          H:\TEST\LIST.DBF A          H:\TEST\PASSW.DBF A          H:\TEST\PAYMTS.DBF A          H:\TEST\PAY_VEND.DBF A    R     H:\TEST\RES_AIR.DBF A    R     H:\TEST\RES_CAR.DBF A    R     H:\TEST\RES_GROU.DBF A    R     H:\TEST\RES_HOT.DBF A    R     H:\TEST\RES_TOUR.DBF A          H:\TEST\SEMI_4.DBF A          H:\TEST\TOUR.DBF A          H:\TEST\TRANS.MEM  H:\TEST>  Part II Ch 5  As you can see in the ﬁgure, all the ﬁles have the Archive attribute set on. Also, all the ﬁles whose names begin with the letters R and G are marked as Read-only.  To change the attributes of ﬁles, use the ﬁrst letter of each attribute’s name and a plus  +  sign to set the attributes on or a minus  –  sign to set the attributes off. You can have any logical combination on one command line, such as the following: ATTRIB -A +R   110  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  The preceding example turns off the Archive attribute and turns on the Read-only attribute for every ﬁle in the current directory. You can narrow the scope of the ATTRIB command by specifying a pathname expression  drive, path, and wildcards are honored  on the command line, as in the following: ATTRIB -R G*.*  This example removes the Read-only attribute from only those ﬁles whose names begin with G.  You get a heavy dose of pathname expressions later in this chapter.   You also can widen the scope of the ATTRIB command by using the  S switch. If you give ATTRIB a pathname expression as a parameter, by default the actions are limited only to the speciﬁed path. Giving no pathname expression to ATTRIB limits its action to the currently logged directory. Using the  S switch widens the scope of the ATTRIB command to include any directories under the directory where ATTRIB begins its actions.  Establishing Read-Only Files The ATTRIB command gives you control over ﬁle attributes. In particular, the Read-only attribute makes DOS unable to overwrite a ﬁle. DOS commands such as EDIT, COPY, DEL, and XCOPY are capable of changing the data contained in a ﬁle. Files with the Read-only attribute cause a message to appear, telling you that the command you have tried to use  cannot provide the service you are wanting.  In practice, however, the Read-only attribute has become little more than a conﬁrmation ﬂag to many modern programs. Both the DOS Shell and Windows File Manager can erase ﬁles having the Read-only attribute, for example, but only after you conﬁrm that it is okay.  To give ﬁles the Read-only attribute, use the +R parameter, as in the following: ATTRIB +R F:\WSTAR\*.TXT  Using the -R parameter has exactly the opposite effect, that of removing the Read-only ﬂag.  The FDISK and FORMAT commands command  do not observe the read-only status of  a ﬁle. FDISK and FORMAT are disk-level commands; therefore, they don’t look at disk directories when they are doing their jobs. Don’t rely on the Read-only attribute of a ﬁle to protect the ﬁle from a disk-level command. Use the disk’s write-protect tab to prevent ﬂoppies from being destroyed with FDISK and FORMAT.  Understanding the Role of Directories  To this point in the chapter, you have read many references to the directory. These refer- ences, although necessary for the explanations of ﬁles at the time, do not provide a great deal of information about directories. Now that you know all about ﬁles, however, it is time to turn your attention to the method used by DOS to organize ﬁles—directories.   Understanding the Role of Directories  111  In many homes, ﬂatware is stored in a drawer in the kitchen. In some homes, the forks and knives and spoons are laid in a jumble, all mixed up. In other homes, a plastic tray that has compartments for each type of utensil is used. Forks stay with forks, salad forks have their own compartment, and so on. The capacity of the drawer to store ﬂatware is not affected, but the drawer stays more organized. So it is with directories. DOS directories have the same purpose: They keep your ﬁles organized.  The root directory is an important table created by the FORMAT command on every disk it touches. It is called the root directory because it is the root, or beginning, of the disk’s ﬁle system. DOS uses the directory as a kind of index system for ﬁnding ﬁles. The ﬁlenames and subdirectory names in this index system are called directory entries. DOS allows for a ﬁxed number of directory entries in the root directory. This number is the same for disks with the same format but varies with different formats. Disks with larger capacities allow for more root directory entries. Although limited, the number of entries is generous. If you properly organize your disks, you will never even come close to this limit.  The DIR command is a window into the structure of a DOS directory. The DIR command accesses and displays selected parts of directory entries, as in this example: C:\>dir ??.bat  Volume in drive C is DATA-TRAIN Volume Serial Number is 1A9A-BEDA Directory of C:\  D4       BAT        39 09-18-90  12:51a EE       BAT        34 04-23-92   4:05p G        BAT        31 05-03-92   3:35a HJ       BAT        28 12-10-92   6:34p SK       BAT        26 08-27-90   3:23p T        BAT        53 06-04-92   1:01a W        BAT       128 05-25-92  10:49a WP       BAT        16 08-27-91   3:46a WS       BAT        35 12-05-90   2:40p DP       BAT        37 09-06-91  10:37a  10 file s         427 bytes  16,437,248 bytes free  C:\>  As you can see, DIR lists the ﬁlenames, extensions, the number of bytes in the ﬁle, the date it was last written to disk, and the time of the last write. The DIR command, however, does not display all the elements of a directory entry. Table 5.4 lists the components of a directory entry.

DIR also displays the ﬁle size. These components, or ﬁelds, of a directory entry contain information useful to you as well as to DOS  see Figure 5.2 . DIR displays this information to assist your ﬁle-management activities.  Figure 5.2 The ﬁelds of a direc- tory entry.  Filename    Extension   Attributes   Reserved   Time   Date   Starting Cluster   Size  The easiest way to cause DOS to display the names of the current drive and directory is to place the following line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle: PROMPT $p$g  This line alters the default DOS prompt to show you the current pathname expression. For more information about PROMPT, see Chapter 11, “Controlling Your Environment.”  DOS also stores volume labels in directory entries, using the combined ﬁlename and extension ﬁelds to form an 11-byte  11-character  ﬁeld just like a ﬁlename. DOS knows that the directory entry is a volume label—not a ﬁlename—because the Volume Label attribute for the entry is set.  The starting cluster and ﬁle attribute ﬁelds, shown in Table 5.4 and in Figure 5.2, are not included in the DIR command’s displayed output. The starting cluster ﬁeld contains the clus- ter number of the ﬁrst cluster DOS has allocated for a particular ﬁle’s storage.  Chaining Through a File The starting cluster ﬁeld of a ﬁle’s directory entry is the key to the ﬁle’s storage allocation as tracked in the FAT. You recall that DOS creates a FAT for each disk during formatting. The FAT indicates whether each cluster on the disk is allocated to a ﬁle. Much as a restaurant hostess looks at a table chart for a place to seat you, DOS looks at the FAT for available clusters when a ﬁle is created or enlarged. When you arrive early at a restaurant, it is nearly empty, and the hostess seats you in the general vicinity of other guests, leaving other sections of the restaurant unused. When DOS allocates ﬁles on a freshly formatted disk, DOS uses the ﬁrst cluster and sequences through a connected series of clusters, leaving many clusters unused at the end of the   Expanding the File System Through Subdirectories  113  FAT. When you leave the restaurant, the hostess marks your table as being available. Likewise, when you erase or shorten a ﬁle, DOS marks the released clusters in the FAT as being available to store another ﬁle.  You might have had a dining experience in which the hostess did not have enough adjacent tables to seat your entire party. Your group is fragmented across two or more tables, with other parties seated at tables between the parts of your group. Your group is fragmented, but you can remain connected as a group by telling the waiter, “We’re with those people over there,” as you point to the other table.  When a DOS command or applications program asks DOS to store a ﬁle on the disk, DOS checks the FAT, ﬁnds the next available cluster, and stores a portion of the ﬁle there. If that cluster cannot accommodate the entire ﬁle, DOS ﬁnds the next available cluster and stores part of the ﬁle there. DOS does not look for the largest available block of clusters, so the entire ﬁle might not ﬁt in the ﬁrst group of available clusters. starting As with the large party in the restaurant, your ﬁle becomes fragmented across the disk.  In Chapter 7, “Preparing and Maintaining Disks,” you learn more about fragmentation. There, you also learn how you can correct this condition and improve your disk performance.  Expanding the File System Through Subdirectories  Earlier in this chapter, disk directories were likened to the plastic trays that many house- holds use to organize eating utensils. The metaphor is not outlandish. This plastic tray sepa- rates similar utensils to make them easier to ﬁnd; takes up very little room; and generally simpliﬁes the storage of forks, spoons, knives, and so on. The DOS directory structure sim- pliﬁes the storage of program and data ﬁles and makes them easier to ﬁnd when needed.  When you use FORMAT to prepare a disk, it creates a root directory structure. The number of entries that this directory can contain is limited. On most ﬂoppy disk formats, the num- ber of entries is limited to 512. On hard disks, the capacity is proportional to the size of the volume  logical disk  being created. There is very little chance that you will ever exceed the capacity, unless you try to store all the ﬁles on your hard disk in the root directory.  Imagine what chaos might reign if all your ﬁles were lumped together in one single direc- tory. You would never be able to tell what ﬁles belonged with what program. Your data ﬁles from your word processor would all be scrambled up with ﬁles created by other programs, and every time you wanted to locate a ﬁle, the directory listing would go on for screen after screen.  To avoid these problems, DOS employs a method of creating subdirectories that branch off from the root directory. Subdirectories can in turn branch off into subordinate subdirecto- ries. Figure 5.3 shows part of the display generated by the TREE command, which is used to represent the directory of a disk graphically.  Figure 5.3 shows the directory structure of a working disk drive. At the top of the tree, the E: represents the root directory. The vertical line that aligns with the E: shows the ﬁrst level of directories, those that appear in the root directory. Two subdirectories, BRIEF and  CLIPPER5, branch off from the root. The BRIEF directory in turn branches off four times to create four subdirectories to hold ﬁles associated with Brief, a programmer’s editor. One of  Part II Ch 5   114  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  these subordinate directories contains Help ﬁles, another contains macro ﬁles, and so on. If you want to ﬁnd a ﬁle containing a Brief macro, you use the DIR ﬁle to generate a listing, as in the following: DIR E:\BRIEF\MACROS  Figure 5.3 Directories are used to organize the ﬁles on a disk.  It is unlikely that a Brief macro can work its way into the CLIPPER5\LIB directory, so you can see that, by creating and maintaining directories, you can pinpoint easily the ﬁles you need to work with. In Chapter 13, “Controlling Devices,” you learn about the FIND com- mand, which helps track down ﬁles that are not stored where you think they should be stored.  A good general system for creating directory structures is to have each application you install on your hard disk be contained within its own directory. The directory should have a name that tells you immediately what program resides in the directory. A good name for a WordPerfect directory is WP, for instance.  Installation programs for software applications often install ﬁles into directory structures created during installation. The Clipper programming language automatically creates a directory called CLIPPER5 and then places library, object, and binary ﬁles into subdirectories called LIB, OBJ, and BIN. It also creates other directories, but you get the idea.  Files associated with the main application can be made to reside in subdirectories that hold groups of ﬁles of the same types. The Clipper installation routine puts all the library ﬁles into the LIB directory. If later you create or buy other libraries from another source, you can copy them into the library directory, or you can create a directory that branches off the LIB directory to hold these ﬁles. You should do whatever makes them easiest for you and your software to ﬁnd them.   Expanding the File System Through Subdirectories  115  Understanding Pathname Expressions  A pathname expression indicates the path that DOS must traverse to ﬁnd a speciﬁed ﬁle or group of ﬁles. A pathname expression has three components: drive, directories, and ﬁles.  The drive component identiﬁes the disk drive used to store the ﬁles. It is made up of three characters: the drive letter, followed by a colon  :  and a backslash  \ , as in the following example: C:\  DOS uses the backslash character to separate the directories within a pathname expression. The preceding example is a pathname expression that indicates the root directory of drive C because the backslash immediately follows the colon.  The directory component of the pathname expression is a list of all the directories that must be traversed to reach the last named directory or the ﬁle component. The following is an example: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\GAMES  In this example, the pathname expression tells DOS to look for ﬁles by starting at the root directory of C:, moving into the WINDOWS directory, through the SYSTEM directory that branches from the WINDOWS directory, and then into the GAMES directory. Simply stated, a pathname expression gives DOS directions to directories, just like you might give a friend directions to your house.  The third portion of a pathname expression speciﬁes a single ﬁle explicitly, or it uses wild- cards to specify a group of ﬁles, as in the following two examples: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\GAMES\SOL.EXE  C:\DOS\*.COM  The ﬁrst example speciﬁes a single ﬁle in the GAMES directory, whereas the second example speciﬁes a group of ﬁles using a wildcard. Pathname expressions can use ?, *, ., and .. as valid wildcard characters.  DOS requires each ﬁle on a disk to have a unique name. For this reason, DOS considers a ﬁle’s full name to be the pathname expression that explicitly identiﬁes that one ﬁle. For example, the name C:\DOS\GO.BAT  is not the same as the following: C:\TEMP\GO.BAT  Yes, two files have the name GO.BAT, but they are in different directories, so both ﬁles have a unique name.  If you issue the following command, which ﬁle’s contents are displayed depends on what directory you are currently logged in to: TYPE GO.BAT  Part II Ch 5   116  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  If you are logged in to either the DOS or TEMP directories of drive C, you see the contents of the ﬁle named GO.BAT found in that directory. If you are logged in to the GRAPHIC directory, you might get a file not found message.  The trick to using pathname expressions effectively is knowing when to use the full formal pathname and when to use a less speciﬁc pathname expression.  People, like ﬁles, can be called either by a formal title, such as George W. Bush, President of the United States, or by a less formal form of address, such as President George Bush. Mr. Bush and George are other examples of names that identify the President. Pathname expressions can likewise be formal or informal.  New Directories Newcomers to DOS often are puzzled to see directory listings that contain ﬁlenames that look like periods. Many people, afraid to appear silly, never ask what the periods mean.  When you create a new directory in DOS, it adds two entries to the new directory. The name of the ﬁrst entry is always .  called dot . The second entry is always named ..  called dot-dot . The dot entry in a directory refers, or points, to the directory that contains it. You can think of the dot entry as an alias for the current direc- tory’s name, analogous to the pronoun me. Although no DOS manual documents this fact, you also can use the dot as a wildcard character in most commands. For example, the following  DEL .  is the same as DEL *.*  DIR ..  DOS uses the dot-dot entry to point to the parent of the current directory. This entry is an alias for the parent directory’s name and is analogous to the names Mom or Dad. The following command, for example, lists all the ﬁles in the current directory’s parent directory:  In the root directory, .. has no meaning because the root directory has no parent.   The full formal pathname expression for a ﬁle expresses the location of a ﬁle or group of ﬁles explicitly without regard to the currently logged directory. This type of pathname expression is sometimes called an absolute path. The following is an example: TYPE C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT  This command displays the contents of your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle onscreen no matter what drive or directory is currently logged. If, however, you currently are logged in to the root directory of C:, typing the C:\ portion of the pathname expression becomes optional because DOS always looks for a speciﬁed ﬁle in the current directory. Therefore, the follow- ing ﬁnds the proper ﬁle if you are logged in to C:\: TYPE AUTOEXEC.BAT  This pathname formal expression uses a relative path to locate the ﬁle. Specifying a relative path involves giving directions to DOS, based on its currently logged directory. Each of the following three examples uses a relative path as its pathname expression:   Expanding the File System Through Subdirectories  117  DIR .. DIR C: DIR SAMPLES\*.DOC  The ﬁrst uses .. to cause DIR to show all ﬁles in the directory from which the current direc- tory branches out. The second example lists all ﬁles in whatever directory is currently logged on drive C. The third example lists all the .DOC ﬁles in the SAMPLES directory, which branches off from the current directory.  Pathname expressions can range from the very simple to the very complex. Keep in mind two rules when you’re creating directories on your system:    DOS pathname expressions cannot exceed 63 characters in length, including the  implicit backslash DOS adds internally.    Typing long strings of directory names is both a pain in the neck and an invitation to  typing errors.  If you really understand the second rule, you will never have a problem with the ﬁrst rule. When you’re creating directory structures on hard disks, keep the depth of directories to a minimum. When you are tempted to create a pathname that exceeds three directories deep, stop and think. At least half the time, you can come up with a better way to arrange directo- ries so that you don’t end up typing pathname expressions that sprawl across half the screen.  As complex as pathname expressions can become, most new users are surprised to ﬁnd that they need learn only three simple commands to create and maintain DOS directories. The following sections provide a rundown of each command.   Creating Directories with MKDIR  MD   DOS provides the internal MKDIR command to create directories. You can abbreviate the name of the command as MD for convenience. Because MD, or make directory, is easier to remember, this form is used in this chapter. Anywhere you see a reference to the MD com- mand, you can substitute MKDIR.  Part II Ch 5  The syntax for the MD command is as follows: MD d:\path\dirname  The command uses a pathname to explicitly describe the drive and pathway to the new directory to be created. You learn more about pathnames in the following paragraphs. For now, consider the following line: MD E:\BRIEF\MACROS\OLDMACS  This example creates the OLDMACS directory branching from the BRIEF\MACROS directory. Subdirectory names are just directory entries in the parent directory. MACROS, for example, is just an entry in the BRIEF directory. What differentiates a subdirectory name from a ﬁle- name is the Directory attribute. The starting cluster associated with the directory name is the ﬁrst cluster on the disk where that directory’s entries are written.   118  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  DOS naming rules allow a directory name to be up to 11 characters long. You can create a directory named STUFF.OLD, but by convention, DOS users have largely agreed to keep dir- ectory names to eight characters or fewer. When the DIR command lists a directory, subdi- rectories are marked with a   in the column where the size of a ﬁle is normally shown. Figure 5.4 illustrates how directory names are listed by DIR.

Information about MOVE is presented later in this chapter and in Chapter 8, “Managing Your Files.”  As you can see, the DIR listing shows the directory structure for the root directory of E:. It contains several entries for subdirectories as well as three text ﬁles.  When you use the MD command, follow these guidelines:    The speciﬁed or implied parent directory of the intended directory must exist. If the  JILL directory doesn’t exist, MD JILL\JACK fails.    MD cannot make more than one directory at a time.   MD does not change the current directory to the new directory. To change to the new  directory, you must use CHDIR  CD .  If, for example, your current directory is \DOS and you want to add the directory \DOS\ DRIVERS, you can issue the following command: MD DRIVERS   Expanding the File System Through Subdirectories  119  Notice that no backslash appears in front of the new directory name. DOS interprets this path to be a relative path, and it adds the current directory path to the pathname expression on the command line.  Changing the Current Directory with CHDIR  CD   As you work with drives and ﬁles in DOS, you can consider each directory to be a location and the pathname expression of the directory to be its map. DOS keeps in memory your current location on each drive of your machine.  Use the CHDIR command to change from one directory to another. The short form of CHDIR is CD, meaning change directory. If you are in the WINDOWS directory and you want to work in the SYSTEM directory that branches off the WINDOWS directory, issue the following command: CD SYSTEM  The WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory then becomes your currently logged directory. DOS remem- bers which directory is current for each drive in your system. When you switch to another drive, DOS automatically retains a memory of where you were working last. Consider this example: C: CD \DOS\UTILS F: COPY *.BAT C:  In this example, you move onto drive C and change directories to the DOS\UTILS directory. The next command moves you to drive F and copies all the batch ﬁles in the current direc- tory of F: to the current directory of C:. In this case, the ﬁles are copied to C:\DOS\UTILS.  To change directly to the root directory of the currently logged disk from any directory on the disk, issue the following command: CD \ Also, if you are not sure what directory you are currently in, issuing the CD command with no pathname expression causes DOS to display the full pathname expression for the current directory.  You can also issue the following command to return to the directory above your current one  for example to move from C:\DATA\DOCS to C:\DATA : CD ..  Part II Ch 5  You can use either a relative path or an absolute path to specify what directory to change into. Assume you are currently logged in to C:\DOS\UTILS, for example, and issue the fol- lowing command: CD ..\STUFF  This example uses a relative path to log you in to the C:\DOS\STUFF directory. You also can log in to the same directory by issuing this command: CD \DOS\STUFF   120  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  When you’re using the CD command, follow these guidelines:    The drive and path parameters in the command line must be valid.   If the path parameter begins with \, CD assumes that the directory speciﬁed in the path  is absolute—from the root.    If the path parameter does not begin with \, CD assumes that the directory given in the  path is relative to the current directory.    When you specify a drive parameter but no path parameter, CD reports the current  working directory for the speciﬁed disk.    When you omit the path parameter and the drive parameter from the command line, CD  reports the current working directory of the currently logged drive.  Deleting Directories with RMDIR  RD   Just as you occasionally need to add a directory to a disk, you might need to delete a direc- tory. DOS enables you to remove empty directories at the end of a directory branch in the directory tree with the RMDIR command, RD for short.  When you’re working with the RD command, remember that RD can delete only empty direc- tories. If a directory contains ﬁles or has another directory branching from it, RD fails. To delete a directory using RD, use a command similar to the following: RD \COLD\HOT\WARM  If the WARM directory is empty, RD removes it from the directory tree.  Using DELTREE to Delete Directories  The DELTREE command, new in DOS 6.0, makes the RD command obsolete. DELTREE enables you to delete directories that contain ﬁles—even complete branches of a directory tree. This command removes the directory you specify and everything in it—subdirectories, ﬁles, and ﬁles in subdirectories. In addition, attributes of ﬁles in the subdirectories are ignored. You do not need to use ATTRIB to clear attributes such as Read-only or Hidden before you delete them.  The syntax for DELTREE is as follows: DELTREE  Y d:path  The optional d: parameter speciﬁes the disk that contains the directory branch to be removed. If you omit d: from the command line, DOS assumes that the current  logged  disk holds the directory to be removed.  The required pathname expression speciﬁes the topmost level of the directory branch to be removed. If the path begins with a backslash  \ , DOS assumes that the path to the directory name is absolute from the root. If the path parameter does not begin with a backslash, DOS assumes that the path to the directory name is relative from the current directory of d:.   Expanding the File System Through Subdirectories  121  The  Y parameter is optional. Because DELTREE is a potentially dangerous command, capable of wiping out hundreds of ﬁles at a time, DOS normally displays the following message: Delete d:path and all its subdirectories? [Y N]  If you type Y and press Enter, the command proceeds; if you type N and press Enter, the operation stops. If you use the  Y parameter, however, the message does not appear, and DELTREE proceeds as though you had typed Y.  DELTREE deletes everything in its path. As with anything in computing, a feature that gives you a great deal of power also gives you the ability to shoot yourself in the foot. Be sure you no longer need anything in any of the directories subordinate to the one you name before proceeding. To make sure, ﬁrst issue the DIR command  with the  S parameter  or the TREE command, which is discussed later in this chapter.  Assume, for example, that your hard disk has a string of directories branching off from the root directory of C:. The pathname expression that speciﬁes the lowest level directory is C:\HOT\COLD\WARM\TEPID\ICY. If you issue this command, all the ﬁles and directories in the WARM directory are deleted regardless of ﬁle attributes: DELTREE  Y C:\HOT\COLD\WARM  Any directories that may branch off from WARM, TEPID, or ICY are also deleted, along with any ﬁles they contain.  As you can see, DELTREE is a powerful command. Always double-check your command line for errors before you press Enter to activate the command.  Remember,  too, that you can use wildcards in the pathname expression of the command line, but use them only with caution. If a wildcard in a pathname expression matches both directory names and ﬁlenames, both are deleted. It is often a good idea to use the DIR com- mand ﬁrst to see what ﬁles the pathname expression affects before using that pathname expression with DELTREE.  Part II Ch 5  Renaming Directories  Having to change the name of a directory is not uncommon. This need might arise because you misspell the name of the directory during creation or because you have upgraded soft- ware and want the upgrade to be reﬂected in the directory name.  The MOVE command enables you to rename directories from the command line and also moves ﬁles from one directory to another. The syntax of the MOVE command for renaming directories is as follows: MOVE d:oldpath d:newpath  The optional d: parameter speciﬁes the disk that contains the directory branch to be removed. If you omit d: from the command line, DOS assumes that the current  logged  disk holds the directory to be removed.   122  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  This command requires two pathname expressions. The ﬁrst speciﬁes the directory you want to move or rename. The second pathname expression speciﬁes the new name of the target directory or the name of a directory to be created as a result of the command’s actions. If the directory does not exist, MOVE prompts you to ask whether the directory should be created. Answer Y, and the new directory is created.  To rename a directory, use the MOVE command as in the following example: MOVE C:\TEMP\BAK C:\TEMP\BACKUP  Helping DOS Find Files with PATH  When you issue a DOS command, COMMAND.COM, the command interpreter, looks ﬁrst to see whether the command is internal to DOS. If the command is not internal, DOS looks on the disk for a ﬁlename having the same name as the command.  In this regard, both external DOS commands and other executable ﬁles have equal status. Files having the extensions .EXE, .COM, and .BAT are all considered by DOS to be executable program ﬁles. DOS simply looks for any executable ﬁle having the same name as the com- mand-line keyword. It then runs the ﬁrst ﬁle it ﬁnds.  The DOS search path works only with executable ﬁles. If a program uses auxiliary ﬁles such as overlays and data ﬁles, an error can occur unless the program is written to search its own directory, not just the currently logged directory.  None of DOS’s external commands use auxiliary ﬁles, so you never have a “ﬁle not found” problem as long as the DOS directory is included in the search path. To run applications that use auxiliary ﬁles, you should log in to the directory where the applica- tion is written to disk to ensure error-free operation.  You have three ways to make sure DOS ﬁnds an external program ﬁle. You can do any of the following:    Log in to the disk and directory that contains the command   Supply the path in the command line   Establish a DOS search path to the command’s directory  The PATH command places a path search string in the DOS environment. DOS uses the contents of this environment variable to determine where on the system it should look for program ﬁles.  Normally, the PATH command is included as a statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle, so it takes effect even before the ﬁrst DOS prompt is displayed. Using the PATH command, however, is not restricted to lines in AUTOEXEC.BAT. You can type a new search string at any DOS   Listing Directories with TREE  123  prompt. Whether it is in a batch ﬁle or typed at a DOS prompt, the PATH command is used the same way, as in the following example: PATH C:\;C:\DOS;D:\WINDOWS;E:\BRIEF  If you enter a command at the DOS prompt and COMMAND.COM does not recognize it as an internal DOS command, DOS always looks ﬁrst in the currently logged directory. If the ﬁle cannot be found there, DOS uses the PATH information to ﬁrst search the root directory of drive C, then the \DOS directory of C:, then the WINDOWS directory on D:, and ﬁnally the BRIEF directory on E:. Only after searching all ﬁve directories for an executable ﬁle, and not ﬁnding it, does DOS give you the dread Bad command or file name message.  The directories you want searched are listed on the command line separated by semicolons  ; . The order in which the directories are listed is the order in which they are searched. For this reason, it is prudent to keep the DOS directory and other frequently used directories at the front of the search string.  In the preceding sample PATH command, DOS is directed to ﬁrst look in the root directory of drive C. This directory is traditionally a favorite repository for batch ﬁles that automate the launching of applications. The second directory speciﬁed is the DOS directory. The DOS directory should always be at or near the beginning of the search path because ﬁles in this directory are constantly being called on. Having the DOS directory at the head of the search path cuts down on the time spent searching for external DOS commands. Exceedingly long search paths can dramatically slow down your computer’s response time.  The order of the search path is important for another reason as well. If two directories have executable programs with the same names, the program that is run is the one whose direc- tory is speciﬁed closer to the beginning of the search path.  Although the maximum length of the search path is 127 characters, avoid creating long search paths. Traditionally, search paths are used mainly to allow DOS to ﬁnd often-used utilities without having to change logged drives or directories. Having too many directories in the search path slows down system performance because it takes DOS longer to deter- mine whether a command is valid. Some software applications, such as Windows, require an entry in the search path for efﬁcient operation, however. In general, if you seldom use the executable ﬁles in a directory, it is better to leave that directory out of the search path.  Part II Ch 5  Listing Directories with TREE  DOS provides an external command, TREE, that lists all the directories of a disk as a tree structure similar to the DOS Shell’s directory display. Figure 5.4 shows the TREE command’s output. The TREE command also can list the ﬁles in the directories. TREE is especially useful when you’re working with hard disks because it visually maps out the directory structures of disks.  The TREE command syntax is as follows: TREE d:path  F A   124  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  d: is an optional parameter that indicates the drive whose directories you want to list. If you omit d:, TREE lists the directories on the current disk drive.  The path expression names the directory where TREE is to start processing the listing. If you omit this parameter, TREE begins processing from the root directory.  TREE accepts two switches. The  F switch instructs TREE to display the ﬁles contained within directories as part of the visual tree. The  A switch instructs TREE to use printable characters instead of the line-drawing characters normally used to indicate branching of directories. Use the  A switch when you’re directing output to an older printer that cannot print graph- ics characters or when using a text-only video adapter.  Using a Temporary Directory  Many programs and some DOS operations use a directory as a temporary location to store scratchpad ﬁles. A scratchpad ﬁle is a ﬁle that is created as a buffer to store information tem- porarily before a permanent ﬁle is created. A good example of a program that uses tempo- rary storage space is Windows. Windows creates .TMP ﬁles in the temporary directory to hold swapping information. Also, the Windows Print Manager uses the temporary directory to create ﬁles to hold print jobs. Other programs use temporary space as a place to store sorting information, backup copies of ﬁles being processed, and so on.  Traditionally, DOS users have created a directory called TEMP that branches off the root directory of C:. In fact, if this directory doesn’t exist when you install DOS 6.22 using the Setup program, it is created for you automatically.  The SET command, which creates DOS environment variables, normally is used in AUTOEXEC.BAT to create a variable called TEMP, as shown in this example: SET TEMP=C:\TEMP  Redirecting Your Output Like DIR and TYPE, TREE is one of those DOS commands that can produce many pages of output. DOS offers two features to enable you to capture screen output in a more usable form.  You can use the MORE command to capture screen output from other commands and present the screens one at a time, pausing for a keystroke as each screen is displayed. MORE is unusual because you enter it on the command line of another command using the pipe    symbol, which you can ﬁnd on the same key as the backslash on most keyboards. Check out the following command example:  TREE  F  MORE  The preceding command captures the output of the TREE command and passes it to the MORE command. The MORE command breaks up the output into single screen portions. As each single screenful of the output is dis- played, MORE waits for you to press a key before it displays the next screenful.  The problem with MORE is that you cannot go backward. When a screenful of output has been replaced with another, the ﬁrst screenful is lost. To see it again, you must repeat the command that called MORE.  You also can use the DOS redirection feature to capture long output to a ﬁle or send it directly to a printer by using the output redirection symbol  > , as in the following two examples:  TREE  F >TREE.TXT   Troubleshooting  125  TREE  F >PRN  The ﬁrst example directs the output to be saved in a ﬁle named TREE.TXT. You then can use an editor to view the output of the TREE command. If your editor has problems displaying graphic characters, use the  A switch to get readable output.  The second example directs the output of the TREE command to the printer. Make sure the printer is online and ready before you put the TREE command into action.  For more information on DOS’s redirection features, see Chapter 13.  When DOS or another program needs to create temporary ﬁles, it looks in the environment to see whether a TEMP variable exists. This way, you can direct DOS to use a speciﬁc direc- tory. If you don’t have a TEMP directory, most software uses the currently logged directory to create scratchpad ﬁles. You should always make sure that the TEMP directory resides on a disk with plenty of free space. Lack of scratchpad space can make programs run much more slowly than normal or display an error message.  Most programs that create scratch ﬁles do a good job of cleaning up after themselves by deleting any ﬁles they might create when the ﬁles are no longer needed.  It is a good idea to check the TEMP directory every few days just to make sure that no scratchpad ﬁles have been orphaned by a power failure or untimely reboot. If you ﬁnd ﬁles in the TEMP directory, you should delete them.  Be careful, however, not to delete ﬁles in the TEMP directory while you’re running Windows or when you’re shelled out to a DOS session from within a running applica- tion. Under these circumstances, the ﬁles still might be active and in use. Never delete ﬁles from the TEMP directory unless you are at a DOS prompt with no other programs running.  Troubleshooting  What happened to my ﬁlenames? Modern operating systems, such as Windows 95 98 ME and Windows NT 2000, enable you to have ﬁlenames up to 256 characters. A common problem occurs when a user copies ﬁles with long ﬁlenames to a DOS machine that supports only the 8.3 ﬁlename format. DOS renames a long ﬁlename by truncating it and adding a tilde  ~  and a numeric character.  If you copy the ﬁle CONVERTIBLE.EXE to a DOS machine, for example, you end up with a ﬁle called CONVER~1.EXE.  If you try to name a ﬁle with an illegal character or with too many characters in the exten- sion, you encounter other errors. The following example uses the COPY command to show what can happen: COPY TEST.TXT 123456789.1234   126  Chapter 5 Understanding Files and Directories  Notice that both the ﬁlename and extension given for the destination ﬁlename contain an extra character: The ﬁlename has the extra character 9, and the extension has the extra char- acter 4. You might predict that DOS will issue a message warning that the ﬁlename and extension are too long. No such luck! DOS simply truncates the ﬁlename to eight characters and the extension to three characters to create a legal ﬁlename  12345678.123 , and then it completes the COPY operation.  Illegal characters in a ﬁlename can prevent DOS from carrying out a command. Here’s an example: COPY 12345678.123 1[3.123  This command causes DOS to display the following message: File creation error  Few experienced DOS users purposely use illegal characters in a ﬁlename, but typos easily can creep into your DOS commands and introduce illegal characters into ﬁlename parame- ters. Type commands carefully, remembering that DOS’s reaction to an illegal ﬁlename isn’t always predictable.   CHAPTER  6  Understanding Disks and Disk Drives In this chapter  Understanding the Disk’s Magnetic Storage Technique 128  Understanding Disk Drives 129  Understanding the Dynamics of the Disk Drive 133  Understanding Disk Formats 137  Understanding DoubleSpace 140  Case Study: Adjusting for Drift 148   128  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  Understanding the Disk’s Magnetic Storage Technique  Early computer hobbyists used everything from discarded paper tape drives to cassette tapes to store ﬁles. For a while, Radio Shack sold cassette tapes that didn’t have the normal plastic leader at the head of the tape so that computer users didn’t have to wind tapes past the leader by hand.  Fortunately, the fastest advances in computer science have revolved around memory and storage. The original IBM PC had two single-sided 5 1 4-inch  160KB  ﬂoppy disk drives, period. Hard drives weren’t supported by the IBM PC BIOS until the 10MB hard disk became the standard in the early XTs.  Floppy disks have evolved to the point where four standard formats are in common use. A ﬁfth format—Extra High Density—is available, but few manufacturers support it yet. You learn more about these sizes later in this chapter.  Hard disks have changed the most. A number of technology standards have come and gone as hard disks have steadily grown larger and faster. Drives that are capable of storing more than twenty gigabytes  approximately two billion bytes  now cost less than $200.  CD-ROM drives, which can hold more than 640MB of data, are widely available in today’s systems and have become the standard for software. Also, with the advent of both write-once  CD-R  and rewritable  CD-RW  CD-ROM media, CDs now have many more uses, such as backups and custom software distribution. Another format that has recently come on the scene is DVD-ROM, which is a new CD-style format that can hold more than 17GB of information. The main drawback of DVD-ROM drives at this time is their relatively slow speed. Although some CD-ROM drives are as fast as 72x speed, the best DVD-ROM drive is currently around 16x speed. With regard to creating your own DVD-ROMs, DVD-ROM recorders are—at the time of this writing— expensive  more than $800 a drive  compared to CD-R and CD-RW; eventually, this format will probably surpass the current CD-R standard.  Magnetic media come in two basic ﬂavors: ﬂoppy and hard. The following sections give you the technical background on how disks work.  Although this material doesn’t make using the COPY or FORMAT commands any more or less effective, knowing this information can save your data. Magnetic disks, like humans, are mortal; they sometimes suddenly drop dead. Usually, users make mistakes that wreck disks, but sometimes disks just give up the ghost unexpectedly or get trapped in a lightning zap. Disks are generally prone to hazard. This, of course, is why backups are so important. Highly specialized disk-editing software such as Norton Disk Doctor and others of its ilk can help you to revive and resurrect lost data, but only if you know how disks are formatted and how data is stored.  Almost everyone is familiar with the way audio tape recorders work. Because tape recorders and computer disks use similar technologies, take a moment to review the form of the tech- nology you are probably most familiar with.   Understanding Disk Drives  129  In a cassette tape, a long thin ribbon of plastic is coated with an emulsion of ferrous oxides  magnetic coatings , enclosed in a protective plastic case, and passed through a tape trans- port. The transport mechanism pulls the ribbon of tape through at a controlled speed and brings the tape into contact with three magnetic tape heads.  Most tape recorders use an erase head, a record head, and a playback head. On some inex- pensive tape recorders, a single head is used for both playback and recording. This setup doesn’t, by itself, lower sound quality; it means only that you can’t listen to the tape as it is recorded.  When you’re recording a tape, the erase head randomizes the magnetic particles in the oxide emulsion, effectively erasing any previously stored information  sound .  The stereo record head actually has two heads: one for the left channel and one for the right. Sounds are converted into electrical ﬁelds. As the tape passes across the record head, it passes through these ﬁelds, and the random magnetic particles align into replicas of the ﬁeld through which it passes.  When the tape passes over the playback head, the magnetic patterns on the tape are picked up much like a microphone’s diaphragm picks up sound waves. The magnetic images create electrical ﬁelds that then can be turned back into sound waves with a speaker.  A standard stereo cassette tape has four tracks of sound information, two in each playback direction. The ribbon of tape has four discrete stripes of magnetic information.  Now imagine that you make a cassette tape several inches in width. Cut circular discs out of the tape, enclose them in a plastic casing, and build a machine that locks onto the center of the disc and rotates it like a potter’s wheel. To the machine, add a magnetic tape head mounted on an arm that can ﬂoat over the surface of the disc. As the magnetic disc rotates, the head can be positioned to create magnetic stripes in concentric rings, just like the rings in a tree trunk, except that they are symmetrical and evenly spaced.  Voilà! You have just invented the ﬂoppy disk!  Understanding Disk Drives  Actually, you must complete a few steps before you have a ﬂoppy disk drive. First, discard the record head. Because you are recording only the ones and zeros of binary numbers  the bits in a byte , you can simply record over previously recorded information. Because there are only two possible signals rather than varying shades of musical nuance, when you write a one or a zero, it effectively overwrites the previous character. You need only a single read write head for each side of the disk, so your ﬂoppy disk needs two head assembly units to be double-sided.  You also need to record a formatting track to parallel or interweave with the data tracks so that a computer can say, “Record this group of bytes in this location and then read the bytes on that other location.” Provide internal programming on a ROM chip so that DOS only  Part II Ch 6   130  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  needs to send instructions to the disk drive to read and write data from any location at any time. Oh, yes, and hide all this complexity from computer users. Now you have invented the usable ﬂoppy disk!  Take it one step further. Coat a stack of ceramic or metal disks with a much denser magnetic material, mount them on a spindle, and spin them much faster than before. Then, mount multiple high-density read write heads, one for each platter side. Beef up the response times and speeds for all the moving components. Seal all these components into a dust-free can; now you have invented the hard disk, also called a ﬁxed disk because the platters cannot be removed without the user damaging them.  The mechanical parts and electrical circuits of disk drives are complex. Although a disk drive is part of a PC system, the drive is a machine in its own right. DOS relies on the driver pro- grams of the BIOS  the basic input output system, found on ROMs inside your computer  and on ROMs within the drive to handle the low-level control of the drive’s mechanical components.  All disk drives have certain common components: read write heads, head-positioner mecha- nisms, and disk-spinning motors. All disk drives record on disks. Some disks are removable, and some are built into the drive. Both ﬁxed disks and removable disks spin on a center spindle within the disk drive.  Today, most PCs incorporate both ﬁxed disks and removable disks. The BIOS extensions of DOS make provisions for both types of drives. Even with their common features, ﬁxed and ﬂoppy disk drives have some important differences, which are described in the following sections. Knowing these distinctions can help you understand how each type of drive oper- ates in your system.  Hard Disk Drives  Drives with built-in disks are called ﬁxed disk drives or, because their disks are made of rigid material, hard disk drives. You can shorten these terms to ﬁxed disk and hard disk.  A hard disk drive can contain more than one hard disk, or platter. Multiple platters are arranged in a stack, with space between the individual platters. Hard disk drives have great storage capac- ity; these drives can hold anywhere from a few million to a few billion bytes of data.  Figure 6.1 shows a cutaway view of a typical older hard disk. The platters are the drive’s magnetic disks. A head-positioner arm holds the read write heads above and below each sur- face of each platter. When the drive leaves the factory, the components are not exposed, as they are in this ﬁgure; the drive is sealed to keep dust, hair, dirt, smoke, and other contami- nants out of the delicate mechanical parts.  These parts are delicate because the read write heads must ﬂoat very close to the surface of the platter without actually touching them. A single hair on the surface produces a reaction similar to driving the family car over a fallen tree trunk.   Figure 6.1 An inside view of the main components of a hard disk.  Understanding Disk Drives  131  Hard disks have the advantages of quick operation, high reliability, and large storage capac- ity. Hard disks have the disadvantage of tying the data stored on the disk to the PC in which the drive is installed. Because the hard disk’s platters cannot be removed, the data is tied to the drive. Moving an entire hard disk to another computer simply to use the hard disk’s data is impractical.  One way of sharing ﬁles among many computers is to run wire or ﬁber-optic cables between machines and allow a single computer to offer ﬁle services for all the connected workstations. Within this idea, you ﬁnd the genesis of computer networking.  Floppy Disk Drives  In a PC system, the disadvantage of tying data to the hard disk is counterbalanced by the PC’s ﬂoppy disk drive. Floppy disks are protected by a permanent jacket, which encloses the ﬂexible disk. The ﬂexible disk inside the jacket is made of Mylar and is coated with sensitive magnetic ﬁlm.  The ﬁrst ﬂoppy disks were eight inches in diameter. By today’s standards, the early 8-inch ﬂoppy disks didn’t store much data.  A smaller version of the 8-inch ﬂoppy—the 5 1 4-inch mini-ﬂoppy—quickly became the ﬂoppy of choice for PC designers because of its smaller size. The 3 1 2-inch microﬂoppy is yet another departure from its larger, older cousins because it incorporates a rigid plastic case  its jacket  as a protective cover. The 3 1 2-inch Mylar disk inside the microﬂoppy disk is ﬂexible, like the media in 8-inch and 5 1 4-inch ﬂoppies.  Not surprisingly, given the history of computer development, each new generation of ﬂoppy has gotten smaller in physical size. What does surprise many new users is that the physically smaller disks each have greater storage capacity than did their larger ancestors. If some hard- ware manufacturers have their way, a very high-capacity 2-inch ﬂoppy disk is in your future.  Part II Ch 6   132  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  The original IBM PCs used a single-sided 5 1 4-inch ﬂoppy disk that stored only 160KB of data. Later drive mechanisms in PCs, XTs, and their clones added a second read write head assembly to access the other side, and the double-sided, double-density 5 1 4-inch ﬂoppy disk that had the capacity to store 360KB was born. Further advances in drive technology enabled IBM to introduce the double-sided, high-density 5 1 4-inch ﬂoppy with the AT generation of computers. These new disks had the capacity to store 1.2MB, almost quadru- ple the storage of the double-sided variety.  When IBM introduced the PS 2 computer models, it used a disk drive type that had been pioneered on the Apple Macintosh. A 3 1 2-inch ﬂoppy disk that was capable of storing 720KB of data was the standard drive on early PS 2s. Because 720KB was a step down from the 1.2MB available on 5 1 4-inch disks, the development of a 3 1 2-inch high-density for- mat was accelerated. Most of today’s 3 1 2-inch drives are high density but, like their  5 1 4-inch cousins, they also can read and write double-density disks. Figure 6.2 shows the  3 1 2-inch disk drive.  Figure 6.2 Insert the metal shut- ter on a 3 1 2-inch disk ﬁrst.  Write-Protecting a Floppy Disk  You often store data on ﬂoppy disks that should not be erased. To ensure that the ﬁles on a ﬂoppy disk do not get erased accidentally, you can write-protect the disk.  To write-protect a 3 1 2-inch disk, locate the plastic write-protect shutter and slide it so that the window is open  see Figure 6.3 .  When a disk is write-protected, the drive cannot write new information on the disk, even if you inadvertently issue a command that attempts to write data to the disk.   Understanding the Dynamics of the Disk Drive  133  Figure 6.3 A 3 1 2-inch ﬂoppy disk showing a built-in write-protect shutter.  Figure 6.4 Typical disk drive head assemblies.  Understanding the Dynamics of the Disk Drive  Thus far, the discussion of the mechanics of magnetic disk technology has centered on the physical. The following sections of this chapter introduce you to the logical aspects of how drives are constructed and used.  Disk Drive Heads  The read write heads used in magnetic disk drives bear little resemblance to the heads in a tape recorder because they must be mounted in such a way that they can cover the entire radius of a disk. Figure 6.4 shows the hardware for read write heads.  Part II Ch 6  As you can see, the heads are held in place on ﬂexible metal assemblies. Wires that carry electrical signals connect to a ﬂexible ribbon cable. The ribbon cable absorbs wire move- ments when the head assembly moves back and forth from track to track.   134  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  Disk Tracks  Regardless of the type of disk drive, all disks spin on a center axis, just like a CD spins in your stereo system. A ﬂoppy disk spins at 360 revolutions per minute; the rotational speed of a hard disk is 10 times greater  approximately 3,600rpm . The heads, which are posi- tioned above the spinning surface of the disk, are held and moved in distinct steps by an actuator arm and head positioner.  The actuator arm and positioner move the heads over the tracks, which are thin stripes of magnetically recorded information. Magnetic disk tracks are concentric circles, not a spiral- ing groove. Each track is broken up into areas called sectors. As you can see in Figure 6.5, sectors are all the same size physically. At the inside track, the sectors are very close together, but at the outermost track, the edges of the sectors are farther apart.  Figure 6.5 Concentric tracks on a disk’s surface; each track is segmented into areas called sec- tors.  Disk Cylinders  A disk drive’s multiple heads are afﬁxed to a single positioner mechanism, which can move only in a straight line. When one head moves one track in or out on its side of a platter   or ﬂoppy , the other heads all move one track on their respective sides of their respective platters.  If the disk has more than one platter—and most hard disks do—all the heads are positioned on the same track on each of the platters. This alignment of heads on the same track posi- tion on different sides of the platters is called a cylinder, a term derived from the imaginary shape of the stacked circular tracks at any one stopping point of the positioner mechanism  see Figure 6.6 .  On most drives, only one head can be active at one time; the drive must activate all its heads in sequence to write  or read  all tracks across the platters at a particular cylinder position. To ﬁll a cylinder, a four-head drive writes a track with Head 1, Head 2, Head 3, and ﬁnally Head 4. The head positioner moves one cylinder, and the sequence repeats. Processing all tracks of a cylinder before moving to the next cylinder is efﬁcient because all the heads are already in new track positions. As you can see, the data for a ﬁle is spread across all the plat- ters of a hard disk and on both sides of a ﬂoppy.  Another factor that spreads ﬁles across disks is sector interleaving. Hard disks spin quickly— so quickly that some hard disk mechanisms cannot write a sector and be ready to write the   Understanding the Dynamics of the Disk Drive  135  next sector as it spins under the head. If the drive waits for a full revolution of the platter, however, too much time is wasted. For this reason, hard disks use an interleave; that is, they write a sector and then skip two before writing to the third. Interleaves are expressed in ratios, so a hard disk that writes one and skips two has a 1:3 interleave. Some fast drives do not have to wait; they can easily write to the next sector, giving the drive a 1:1 ratio.  Figure 6.6 Tracks, platters, and cylinder.  When you create ﬁles, DOS writes to all the empty sectors on a cylinder and then moves to the closest cylinder with empty sectors. As you use a disk over a period of time, you natu- rally create and destroy many ﬁles.  DOS creates, on the outer tracks of a disk, a table called the ﬁle allocation table  FAT . When you delete a ﬁle, DOS simply changes the FAT to mark as vacant the tracks and sectors that the ﬁle occupied; the ﬁle’s directory information is similarly voided. Remember, drives do not have an erase head, so even “erased” ﬁles are still present on the disk until you write over them. If you erase a ﬁle accidentally, you can use the UNDELETE command or a commer- cial program such as PC Tools or the Norton Utilities to get it back. Just make sure that nothing writes to the drive before you unerase the ﬁle; otherwise, the empty sectors can be used for another ﬁle.  Part II Ch 6  ➔ For more information on UNDELETE, see Chapter 8, “Managing Your Files,” p. 191.  Imagine for a moment that you create a bunch of ﬁles on a disk; some are small and some are large. Use the DOS DEL command to delete only the smallest ﬁles, and you can free up enough room to store another large ﬁle. The empty spaces on the disk are distributed across the disk much like the holes in a slice of Swiss cheese. When you tell DOS to create   136  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  a new large ﬁle, the ﬁrst cylinder to be written to is the one closest to the head position that currently has available sectors.  When all the sectors on that cylinder are full, the drive moves the heads to another track and ﬁlls all the available space on that cylinder. The process continues until all the data in a ﬁle is written. The FAT is updated to show the locations of the data. This process of writing data on widely dispersed cylinders is called ﬁle fragmentation.  File fragmentation is not a dangerous condition, but the constant repositioning of the heads slows the operations of the drive and puts extra strain on the actuator mechanism. For these reasons, DOS offers the DEFRAG command, which rearranges ﬁles on the disk so that they are contiguous.  ➔ For more information on improving your system’s performance with DEFRAG, see “Defragmenting Your  Disk,” p. 177.  Disk Sectors  Figure 6.7 A visual representa- tion of sectors.  When a disk is blank, as it is when it comes from the factory, the disk contains no tracks and, therefore, no information. DOS has to prepare the disk to accept data. This prepara- tion process is known as formatting.  As its name implies, formatting places a uniform pattern of format information in all tracks of the disk. The format information in each track enables DOS to slice each track into smaller, more manageable components of ﬁxed size. These components are called sectors.  Figure 6.7 shows the sectors of a ﬂoppy disk, represented as slices of a disk’s surface. The ﬁgure shows the boundaries for every other sector. The concentric arcs between the indi- cated sectors are the disk’s tracks. Notice that each track has the same number of sector boundaries  and, therefore, sectors .  As you can see in Figure 6.7 and previously in Figure 6.5, the arrangement of sectors  creates V-shaped areas of the disk that remain unused; these areas are sector boundaries. Although you might think that this construction is a waste, it makes the mechanics of drives easier to work with because the sectors are all a uniform size. Having a uniform size for sec- tors provides DOS with a standard unit of data transmission.   Understanding Disk Formats  137  DOS reads and writes disk data one sector at a time. Some of DOS’s internal ﬁle-system bookkeeping is performed by sectors. To DOS, a sector is the disk’s most manageable block of data. By default, DOS uses 512-byte sectors.  The number of sectors formatted into each track is tied to the data density the drive uses when reading or writing data. The more dense the recording in a track and the more tracks on a disk, the more sectors DOS can format. Designers keep reliability in mind when select- ing the number of tracks and number of sectors per track. Floppy disk drives are designed with more margin for error than are hard disk drives. You can easily see why some margin for error is desirable for a drive that must ensure the mechanical alignment of disks that users simply shove into the drive door. Floppy disk drives must also be able to read disks that might have been stored in a place where magnetic ﬁelds weakened the disk’s magnetic imprint.  Despite the protective disk jacket, the magnetic-coated surfaces of many ﬂoppy disks can be contaminated by smoke, dust, or ﬁngerprints. A drive must be able to tolerate some disk contamination and still perform without errors. Clearly, no disk drive can avoid errors if the disks it uses are abused. Drive heads cannot read through liquid spills, for example, or through dents made by a ballpoint pen.  Hard disk drives have greater data-storage capacity than do their ﬂoppy cousins. This capac- ity is due in large part to the precision with which the drive’s critical components work with the special oxides that magnetically coat the platters. In addition, the working parts of the drive are sealed at the factory in a way that protects the platters, positioners, and heads from contamination. With outside inﬂuence on these critical components sealed out, a hard disk drive can offer more tracks and sectors in the same space that a ﬂoppy drive occupies. When you consider the fact that most hard disks have more than one platter, each of which is capa- ble of two-sided operation and each of which provides more tracks than a ﬂoppy disk can, you begin to understand how hard disks have such large storage capacities.  Understanding Disk Formats  Disk drives have a universal way of dividing a disk’s available physical space: The number of platters, number of sides, number of tracks, number of bytes per sector, and number of sec- tors per track are the speciﬁc details that factor into this logical division of disk space. The speciﬁcation for a disk’s use of its physical space is called the disk’s format.  PCs use a variety of disk drive sizes and formats. Some older PCs, for example, have both 5 1 4-inch and 3 1 2-inch ﬂoppy drives that can handle both double-density and high-density disks, while newer PCs only have a 3 1 2-inch ﬂoppy.  Most PC users and software manuals differentiate one format from other formats by using the byte-capacity ﬁgure for the desired format. Each new version of DOS has maintained support for the disk formats that were supported by its predecessors. This support ensures that disks made with older drive formats can be used with current versions of DOS.  Part II Ch 6   138  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  Floppy Disk Formats  The ﬁrst DOS-supported disk drives allowed for twice as many tracks on a 5 1 4-inch ﬂoppy disk as the standard 5 1 4-inch disk formats of the time could accommodate. These DOS formats were called double-density formats. The original PC disk size and format was 5 1 4-inch, single-sided, 40 tracks, with eight sectors per track and 512 bytes per sector. These disks are called single-sided, double-density  SSDD  disks. The capacity of this 8-sector, single- sided format is 160KB  KB equals 1,024 bytes .  Computers generally store data in groups of eight bits. An 8-bit group of data is called a byte. By design, digital computers are most efﬁcient when working with numbers as some power of 2. Numbers that are powers of 2 can be represented directly in binary notation.  Computer programmers and designers apply this power-of-2 convention to the expres- sion of a quantity of bytes. A kilobyte, for example, is 1,024 bytes; 2 kilobytes is 2,048 bytes, or 2KB. A megabyte, or 1MB, equals 1,024KB. A gigabyte, or 1GB, is 1,024MB.  You don’t have to know about the use of numbers in the power of 2, except to note that capacity expressed in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes uses 1,024 as the multiplier rather than 1,000 because a byte has eight bits, and 1,000 is not evenly divisible by eight. For scaling purposes, however, you can think of 1KB as representing approxi- mately 1,000 bytes.  The capacity of disk drives is stated in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes. The storage capacity of a modern hard disk drive is usually anywhere from 2GB to 80GB. The typical capacity of ﬂoppies ranges from hundreds of thousands of bytes to more than 2MB, so a ﬂoppy drive’s capacity can be described in either kilobytes or megabytes.  As you learned earlier, the two types of 5 1 4-inch ﬂoppies have different storage capacities  either 360KB or 1.2MB . Similarly, a 3 1 2-inch disk can store either 720KB or 1.44MB. Still another standard format for 3 1 2-inch disks was introduced a few years ago, offering 2.88MB of storage. To date, this format has not widely caught on because you must have a ﬂoppy disk drive and disks manufactured speciﬁcally to achieve 2.88MB storage capacity.  Table 6.1 summarizes the common ﬂoppy disk formats.  Table 6.1 DOS Floppy Disk Formats  Tracks 40  Sectors Track 8  Total Sectors 320  Usable Capacity 160KB  Format SSDD  DSDD  SSDD-9  DSDD-9  DSDD-9  40  40  40  80  8  9  9  9  640  360  720  1420  320KB  180KB  360KB 720KB*   Understanding Disk Formats  139  Table 6.1 Continued  Format DSHD-15  DSHD-18  HD-36  Tracks 80  80  80  *3 1 2-inch formats **Requires special disk and disk drive  Sectors Track 15  Total Sectors 2400  18  36  2880  5760  Usable Capacity 1.2MB 1.44MB* 2.88MB**  Raw Capacity and Usable Capacity  The process of formatting a blank disk places on the disk some data that is not part of the disk’s total capacity. A 1.44MB disk, for example, actually holds more than 1.44MB of  information. You cannot use this extra space, however; the space is reserved for sector- identiﬁcation and error-checking information. If you buy disks for a 1.44MB drive, the iden- tiﬁcation label might say that the disks have 2MB capacity; disks for a 720KB drive might indicate 1MB capacity. To understand this apparent discrepancy, you need to understand the difference between total, or raw, capacity and usable, or formatted, capacity. The larger of the two numbers for the same disk is considered to be the raw capacity of the disk.  Raw capacity includes the space that the formatting information occupies. The smaller of the two numbers for the same disk is the usable capacity of the disk. This number of bytes is available for storing ﬁles after the formatting information has been put on the disk.  Hard disk manufacturers sometimes advertise the raw capacity of their drives instead of the usable capacity. Your 80MB drive, therefore, might give you only 78MB when formatted. Fortunately, most manufacturers of hard disks state the capacity of their drives as formatted capacity. Hard disks also lose some overhead space. If you have any doubt as to the meaning of a hard disk’s stated capacity, ask the dealer whether the capacity is determined before or after formatting. In this book, disk capacity refers to usable capacity after formatting.  Hard Disk Drive Formats  Formats for hard disks nearly always employ 512-byte sectors, usually with 17 sectors per track. There is an alphabet soup of hard drive types: MFM, IDE, RLL, ESDI, SCSI, and so on. Each type of hard disk uses different numbers of sectors per track. You have to worry about these differences only when you are installing a hard disk drive. The manufacturer of the drive provides you with head, sector, and track information speciﬁc to your drive.  You can understand the concept of hard disk capacity by remembering the concept of cylin- ders. Hard disks, you might recall, have two or more heads. Remember that a cylinder is the alignment of all the heads on the same track on both sides of each platter. A disk with 306 tracks on one side of one platter has 306 cylinders. The total number of tracks on the disk is  Part II Ch 6   140  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  the number of cylinders times the number of heads. The disk’s capacity in bytes is the num- ber of tracks times the number of sectors per track times the number of bytes per sector. To obtain the capacity in kilobytes, divide the result by 1,024. To obtain the capacity in megabytes, divide the kilobyte total by 1,024. For approximations of capacity in megabytes, you can divide by a rounded 1,000.  DOS does not provide low-level format data for a hard disk as it does for a ﬂoppy disk. Hard disks normally are given a low-level format at the factory, so you seldom need to initi- ate a low-level format on a hard disk. DOS uses the low-level format as a base upon which to perform its high-level format.  In a discussion of hard disk formatting, the term format refers to the high-level format initi- ated by the DOS FORMAT command. During the formatting of a hard disk, DOS initializes its bookkeeping tables and then writes dummy data into the disk’s tracks. From your point of view, formatting a hard disk is the same basic operation as formatting a ﬂoppy. DOS keeps the details of the low-level format hidden and out of your way.  Understanding DoubleSpace  Beginning with DOS 6.0, Microsoft decided to include a disk-compression program called DoubleSpace. The decision to include it was apparently prompted by the popularity and success of third-party disk compression programs such as Stacker. Microsoft reﬁned and improved DoubleSpace in DOS 6.2.  DoubleSpace enables DOS to compress data automatically when you store the data on disk and to uncompress the data when you use it. DoubleSpace works transparently; you have no indication that the program is compressing your ﬁles, except that your disk can hold more data than before. You can select which drives use compression and which do not. You might decide, for example, to compress drive C, but not drive D, which contains OS 2.  Only if the DoubleSpace driver is loaded can you read a compressed drive. If you use another operating system in addition to DOS—such as OS 2, Unix, Xenix, or Windows NT—you cannot access a compressed drive while you are running that other system.  Using DoubleSpace provides one major advantage: The amount of data you can store on your hard disk is roughly doubled because DoubleSpace is analyzing your data and squeez- ing more information into less space. DoubleSpace uses a compression algorithm similar to that used in compression programs such as WinZip. The exact amount of additional data you can store varies, depending on the characteristics of the data itself, because different data can be compressed different amounts. Text ﬁles and some graphics ﬁles  such as TIF ﬁles , for instance, can be compressed quite a bit. Other ﬁles, such as WAV ﬁles  used for sound  or GIF ﬁles  used for graphics , are already compressed and do not beneﬁt from DoubleSpace.   Understanding DoubleSpace  141  Using DoubleSpace also has the following minor disadvantages:    DoubleSpace must perform extra work to compress and uncompress data each time  you access your disk. This extra work takes time and slows your computer slightly. If you have a 386 or 486 computer, for example, the slowdown is so insigniﬁcant that you almost certainly will never notice the difference. On slower computers, however, you might notice that operations involving a lot of disk access seem to run a bit more slowly than before.    DoubleSpace requires some conventional memory—about 50KB if you load  DoubleSpace high  into upper memory  by using DEVICEHIGH.    Without the DoubleSpace device driver, a system cannot access a hard disk on which  the ﬁles are compressed with DoubleSpace. This restriction is not likely to cause prob- lems, but if your computer breaks, you cannot remove your hard disk and use it in a computer that has an earlier version of DOS.    You cannot use DoubleSpace with some disk-intensive programs. This is primarily evi- dent with some game programs that swap screens and sound between memory and disk.  A drive might contain ﬁles that cannot or should not be compressed. The Windows swap ﬁle, for example, must remain uncompressed.  When you apply compression to a drive, DoubleSpace makes the drive appear as though it were two drives, with two distinct drive letters. DoubleSpace divides the disk into a com- pressed drive and an uncompressed drive so that you still can store some of your ﬁles in an uncompressed format.  You can decide how much of the disk to allocate for each area. If you don’t expect to store any ﬁles in an uncompressed format, make the uncompressed drive small  a fraction of a megabyte  and allocate the rest to the compressed drive. Conversely, if you expect to store the Windows swap ﬁle on the uncompressed drive, allocate several megabytes to that drive.  DOS assigns a new drive letter to one of the areas so that you can access either area by using the appropriate drive letter. If you apply compression to drive C, for example, DoubleSpace might tell you that from now on C refers to the uncompressed portion of the disk and J refers to the compressed portion.  Part II Ch 6  Installing DoubleSpace  To install DoubleSpace, type the following command at the DOS prompt: DBLSPACE  You must not have any other programs running when you ﬁrst issue this command. In  particular, you must not be running Windows or the DOS Shell.  DoubleSpace ﬁrst asks whether you want an Express or Custom Setup; the default is Express. If you choose Express, DoubleSpace compresses the existing ﬁles on drive C.   142  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  Choose Custom Setup if you want to select the drive to compress. DBLSPACE then installs the DoubleSpace driver in the DOS kernel and reboots your machine.  DoubleSpace also might add a line to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, such as the following: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS  MOVE  This line does not load the DoubleSpace device driver; the DOS kernel loads the driver automatically when you install DoubleSpace. Instead, the line moves the driver into upper memory  if you have upper memory blocks available . If you remove this line from CONFIG.SYS, you still load the DoubleSpace driver, just not into upper memory.  Controlling the Operation of DoubleSpace  You can run DoubleSpace at any time to get information about compression on your disks or to control various facets of DoubleSpace’s operation. You run DoubleSpace simply by typing the following command: DBLSPACE  When DoubleSpace starts, it lists all the available drives that employ compression. For each drive, DoubleSpace shows the total amount of space and current free space available.  Many DoubleSpace operations require you to select a drive, either by using the arrow keys to position the selection bar on one of the drives or by clicking a drive.  Displaying Compressed Drive Information  To display information about a compressed drive, select the compressed drive, choose Drive from the menu bar, and then choose Info from the resulting menu.  If you do not have a mouse, press Alt+D, and then position the cursor on Info and press Enter.  For a shortcut, you can also double-click or simply press Enter when the drive is ﬁrst selected.  Figure 6.8 shows the information display for a small compressed drive. In this example, notice that most of the disk is allocated for compressed ﬁles and is accessed as drive I; about 2MB is uncompressed and is accessed as drive D.  Figure 6.8 DoubleSpace can pro- vide an estimate of free space on a drive based on the current compression ratio of the ﬁles.   Understanding DoubleSpace  143  This ﬁgure also tells you that the estimate of 501.55MB free is based on a compression ratio of 1.3 to 1, but the compression ratio that DoubleSpace actually has achieved on the data stored so far is 2 to 1. Therefore, if the rest of the drive is used for the same type of data, you actually are capable of storing more data than DoubleSpace’s estimate of 501MB leads you to expect.  Clicking the Size and Ratio buttons enables you to change the size of the compressed area and the estimating ratio, respectively. The following sections discuss both methods.  Changing the Size of a Compressed Drive  On each compressed disk, DoubleSpace reserves some room for uncompressed ﬁles. To change the size of the uncompressed area  thereby changing the size of the compressed area correspondingly , perform one of the following actions:    While displaying the Compressed Drive Information dialog box, click the Size button.   On the main screen, select Drive and then Change Size.  When you perform either action, the Change Size dialog box appears  see Figure 6.9 .  Figure 6.9 The Change Size dia- log box will appear whenever you modify the size settings of the DoubleSpace drive.  Part II Ch 6  In this dialog box, you can change the amount of space that DoubleSpace reserves for the uncompressed area.  Changing the Compression Ratio  After you use a compressed drive for a time, you might discover that the actual compression ratio achieved by DoubleSpace is different from the ratio it uses to predict free space. You can ask DoubleSpace to use a different ratio to estimate free space by performing one of the following:    While displaying the Compressed Drive Information dialog box, click the Ratio button.   On the main screen, choose Drive and then Change Ratio.   144  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  DoubleSpace displays the current ratio that it is using for estimates and the actual ratio that it has been able to achieve in compressing your ﬁles so far. If the ﬁles you previously stored in this drive are typical of the ﬁles that you expect to store in the future, you should change the new ratio to match the ratio for stored ﬁles.  In the Change Compression Ratio dialog box shown in Figure 6.10, DoubleSpace is using a 1.3-to-1 ratio to estimate free space but has achieved a 2-to-1 ratio for existing ﬁles.  Figure 6.10 You can also modify the compression ration of a DoubleSpace drive.  The amounts of total space and free space that DoubleSpace displays are estimates that depend on the type of data you store on the disk. In predicting free space, DoubleSpace takes into account the size and actual free space of the compressed volume and then deter- mines an estimated compression ratio. The general rule is that the larger the amount of free space on your compressed volume, the lower the compression ratio used by DoubleSpace. Thus, the large compressed volume used as an example in this chapter has a low 1.3-to-1 compression ratio.  If you have a smaller compressed volume, DoubleSpace uses a higher compression ratio, closer to 2 to 1. In other words, if DoubleSpace has 10MB of physical disk space free, the program predicts that it can compress 20MB of your data into that space.  The estimates used by DoubleSpace are necessarily off—sometimes way off. As you work with your compressed volume, you can adjust the compression ratio used by DoubleSpace for its estimates.  Changing the compression ratio does not change the amount of compression that DoubleSpace can squeeze out of any speciﬁc ﬁle, only the ratio that DoubleSpace uses to estimate future compression.   Understanding DoubleSpace  145  Formatting a Compressed Drive  You do not need to format a compressed drive in the same sense that you format other drives to prepare them for use. When you use DoubleSpace to create a compressed drive, you must have already formatted that drive in the usual way. On the other hand, people often format an existing drive as a simple way of erasing all data on a drive, and you can for- mat a compressed drive if you want to erase all the data stored on that drive. However, you cannot use the standard DOS format on a compressed drive.  To format a compressed drive, select the drive you want to format from the list of com- pressed drives, and then choose Drive and Format. DoubleSpace displays an alert box that asks whether you’re sure you want to format the drive. If you click OK, DoubleSpace erases all data stored in that drive.  You cannot unformat a compressed drive. After you choose Format and click OK, your data is gone forever.  Deleting a Compressed Drive  If you no longer want to use a compressed drive, you can delete that drive. To do so, select the drive that you want to delete from the list of compressed drives. Next, choose Drive and then Delete. DoubleSpace displays a dialog box warning that you will permanently destroy the contents of the compressed drive and asks you for conﬁrmation. If you click OK, DoubleSpace deletes the drive and all the data in the drive. The space that was allocated to the compressed drive returns to the corresponding uncompressed drive.  Make sure you copy all the data from your compressed drive to a backup device or to an uncompressed drive before you delete a compressed drive. You also can use the Uncompress feature, discussed later in this chapter.  Creating a New Compressed Drive  You can create a new compressed drive by choosing an option from the Compress menu. DoubleSpace displays a menu from which you can select either of two ways to compress the disk.  To compress an existing disk and all the data stored on it, follow this procedure:  1. From the Compress menu, choose Existing Drive. DoubleSpace displays a dialog box listing existing uncompressed drives, along with their current and projected free space. 2. Select the drive you want to compress. DoubleSpace displays a dialog box showing the  drive letter that it assigns to the uncompressed drive and the amount of space it allo- cates to that drive. DoubleSpace allocates the rest of the space to the compressed drive.  Part II Ch 6   146  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  You must allocate at least 0.14MB to the uncompressed drive; use this value if you do not expect to need any uncompressed space. If you want to change either of these val- ues, select the value that you want to change. When you are ready to proceed, choose Continue or press Enter.  3. DoubleSpace displays a screen informing you that it is ready to compress the drive. DoubleSpace then prompts you to press C. If you press C, the program creates the compressed drive and compresses existing ﬁles in that drive. The new compressed drive uses the original drive letter, and the uncompressed drive receives the new drive letter.  If you want to leave existing ﬁles in the uncompressed drive and create a new compressed drive from the free portion of the existing drive, follow this procedure:  1. From the Compress menu, choose Create New Drive. DoubleSpace displays a dialog box listing existing uncompressed drives, along with their current and projected free space.  2. Select the drive to which you want to apply compression. DoubleSpace displays the drive letter it will assign to the compressed drive, the compression ratio it will use to estimate free space, and the amount of free space it will leave in the uncompressed drive, in addition to the space already used by existing ﬁles. The program allocates the rest of the space to the compressed drive. You must leave at least 0.14MB of free space in the uncompressed drive; use this value if you do not expect to need any more uncompressed space. If you want to change any of these values, click the value you want to change. When you are ready to proceed, click Continue or press Enter.  3. DoubleSpace tells you how much time the program requires to create the drive and  prompts you to press C to continue. The program then creates the compressed drive, which is empty. All existing ﬁles remain in the uncompressed drive. The uncompressed drive retains the original drive letter, and the compressed drive receives the new drive letter.  Using Other DoubleSpace Features  You can choose two other useful features from the Tools menu: Defragment and Uncompress. A Chkdsk option also is available from the Tools menu, but it just displays information indicating that the Chkdsk function has been replaced by the SCANDISK com- mand.  ➔ To ﬁnd out more about SCANDISK, see “Analyzing a Disk with the SCANDISK Utility,” p. 188.  The Defragment option enables you to defragment a compressed volume. You can use either this option or the standard DEFRAG command  from the DOS prompt . If you choose to use this option, DoubleSpace displays a dialog box asking whether you want to defragment the   Understanding DoubleSpace  147  disk. If you choose Yes, DoubleSpace performs the defragmentation. Note that defragment- ing a compressed disk does not signiﬁcantly increase the speed with which you can access the disk  as DEFRAG does for a regular disk , but it sometimes does enable you to store a bit more data on the compressed disk.  Beginning with DOS 6.2, DoubleSpace enables you to uncompress a previously compressed drive. You do so by copying the data on a compressed portion of a drive to the uncom- pressed portion. Before you choose this option, do the following:    Make sure you reduce the size of the compressed drive as far as possible by using the  Size feature previously discussed. Conversely, this action increases the size of the uncompressed portion of the disk.    Make a backup of your compressed volume.  ➔ For more information about the MSBACKUP program, see “Issuing the MSBACKUP Command,” p. 239.  Uncompressing a DoubleSpace volume can take up to several hours. Make sure you allocate enough free time to complete the procedure.  After you reduce the size of the compressed drive and back it up, choose Uncompress from the Tools menu. DoubleSpace displays a dialog box indicating that it is going to uncompress ﬁles and copy them to the uncompressed portion of the hard drive; it also reminds you to make a backup of your compressed data. When you choose Yes, the drive uncompression begins. DoubleSpace then performs the following steps:  1. It performs a surface scan using SCANDISK to determine the reliability of the destination   uncompressed  disk drive.  2. It performs other SCANDISK tests to verify the integrity of the compressed volume. 3. It performs another surface scan, this time on the source  compressed  disk drive. 4. It uncompresses the ﬁles on the source drive, moving them to the destination drive. 5. It deletes the compressed drive. 6. If the compressed drive being deleted is the last one in your system, DoubleSpace  removes all references to DoubleSpace from CONFIG.SYS and marks the DoubleSpace kernel so that it doesn’t load when DOS is booted.  7. It reboots the computer.  After the computer reboots, the uncompression is complete. Check your data to make sure that it all appears intact; then, you can use your system as normal.  Part II Ch 6   148  Chapter 6 Understanding Disks and Disk Drives  If you have programs that do not work with DoubleSpace, but you still want to enjoy the beneﬁts of disk compression, place the programs on an uncompressed volume. Then, when you need to use those programs, reboot your computer and use the Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+F8 keys to control whether DoubleSpace capability is loaded.  ➔ For information on using multiple boot conﬁgurations, see “Creating Multiple Conﬁgurations,” p. 32.  Case Study: Adjusting for Drift  Drift occurs when the alignment of a hard drive’s read write heads drift slightly after contin- ual use of the drive. Drift also can be detected when you remount the drive or stand the computer on its side like a tower. This drifting does not affect the information that has been written to the disk, but the heads might have difﬁculty locating the information because the low-level format identiﬁcation information, which is needed to ﬁnd the data, is no longer aligned beneath the heads. You can eliminate this problem by performing a low-level format of the disk to align the low-level disk tracks with the current location of the heads. Also, magnetic signals that are recorded on disks lose strength over the years, so the manufac- turer’s low-level format might fade to a point where the heads cannot reliably read format information.  Normally, a low-level format of your hard disk erases all existing data. Certain types of third-party software, however, can perform a low-level format without data loss.   CHAPTER  7  Preparing and Maintaining Disks In this chapter  Understanding Disk Preparation 150  Preparing Floppy Disks with the FORMAT Command 151  Preparing the Hard Disk 158  Disk Commands 166  Getting the Most Speed from Your Hard Disk 168  Getting the Most Space from Your Hard Disk 181  Projects 184   150  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Understanding Disk Preparation  Both ﬂoppy disks and audiocassette tapes use magnetic media to store information, but they’re different in other ways. You cannot just drop a blank disk into a drive and use the disk in the same way that you can use a blank tape to record.  Why? The disk’s recorded areas  sectors  can be accessed in any order, randomly. The tape, however, is sequential. As it plays, the tape recorder doesn’t jump around from place to place—unless, of course, it is being operated by a teenager.  To implement random access on a disk, you ﬁrst must lay down information that can be used to ﬁnd small sections of the disk quickly. In some ways, this process is like drawing the lines on a sheet of notebook paper to show where the writing should be done. This prepara- tion process is called formatting. The DOS FORMAT command performs this process for disks; you do nothing more than enter the command. FORMAT analyzes a disk for defects, generates a root directory, sets up a storage table, and makes other technical modiﬁcations.  When you format a disk, DOS creates data-storage divisions on the disk’s surface. As you learned in Chapter 6, “Understanding Disks and Disk Drives,” these divisions are concentric circles called tracks  see Figure 7.1 . DOS decides what type of drive you have and then posi- tions the tracks accordingly.  Figure 7.1 Anatomy of a ﬂoppy disk.  You probably already know that with computers, items that are numbered often begin with 0 rather than 1. It’s the same way with tracks on the disk; they’re numbered beginning with track 0. DOS uses this ﬁrst track  track 0  to record vital information about the disk’s for- mat. Later, by checking this information on track 0, DOS quickly can determine how to work with the disk.  As you can see in Figure 7.1, each track is divided into segments called sectors, which are the smallest divisions of a disk. When you issue the FORMAT command, DOS creates a special disk table called the ﬁle allocation table  FAT . The FAT, which is always located on track 0, monitors every sector on a disk as groups of clusters. DOS stores data in the clusters and uses the track and cluster numbers to retrieve the data.  A cluster is the smallest unit of storage that DOS allocates for ﬁle storage at one time, unless you are using DoubleSpace or a similar ﬁle-compression utility. DoubleSpace drives have storage allocated in smaller units, but this doesn’t affect the way DOS views the disk. DOS hands data to be written to DoubleSpace in the standard way.   Preparing Floppy Disks with the FORMAT Command  151  In the preceding chapter, you learned about cylinders. A cylinder is formed by stacking tracks on top of one another. A cylinder on a ﬂoppy disk, for example, is made by stacking two tracks: the front and back of the disk. The two read write heads in the ﬂoppy drive are positioned over two tracks. Tracks are broken up into sectors, so the read write heads are positioned over two sectors.  DOS does not write one ﬁle on the front sector and one ﬁle on the back sector because doing so creates a situation in which the read write heads have to move around too much, slowing operations. To prevent this problem, DOS looks at the two sectors under the ﬂoppy drive’s heads as a single unit—a cluster. Therefore, if you write a ﬁle containing only six bytes onto a ﬂoppy disk, DOS reserves a cluster  two 512-byte sectors  for the ﬁle to reside in.  On hard disks, the number of sectors in a cluster also is equal to the number of read write heads. Therefore, a disk with four platters would group eight sectors into a cluster, so writ- ing a six-byte ﬁle would actually take 4KB of free space.  At ﬁrst, all this unused space might seem wasted, but look at any disk and see how many ﬁles are only six bytes long. Data ﬁles are seldom static because information constantly is being added or removed. Chances are that the ﬁle won’t remain six bytes long. Also, when you think that most ﬁles are thousands or hundreds of thousands of bytes long, a few unused sectors represent a very small percentage of total used disk space.  All DOS commands use tracks and clusters as road maps that enable them to carry out their operations. When a disk is formatted, DOS creates a FAT and root directory that are suited to the capacity of the disk.  Preparing Floppy Disks with the FORMAT Command  The FORMAT command prepares disks for use. All disks to be used by DOS must be format- ted by DOS to be treated as valid DOS disks. Both ﬂoppies and hard disks must be format- ted before they can be used. If you try to use a disk that has not been formatted, DOS reports a General failure, which sounds cataclysmic. All it really means is that the disk you are trying to read does not have valid format information. If the disk you are trying to read has been formatted and you know that it has been formatted, a problem exists. If that drive is your C: drive, you do have a cataclysmic experience to endure. Most of the time, however, a General failure just means that somebody has handed you an unformatted disk.  When you issue the FORMAT command with its required parameters, DOS presents you with a prompt, requiring that you answer a question before the command actually begins its work. In the case of a ﬂoppy, DOS prompts you to insert the proper disk into the drive. On a hard disk, DOS reminds you that you are about to wipe out everything on the disk.  In either case, the tendency of experienced users is just to hit the key and go. Don’t! Take a deep breath and read the prompt. You might have accidentally speciﬁed C: when you really meant B:. Take a moment to be sure; the data you save might be your own.  Part II Ch 7   152  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Reformatting an old disk also can be an efﬁcient way to delete the contents without the has- sle of dealing with individual ﬁles and directories. Before DOS 5.0, reformatting a disk in effect erased the data stored on the disk and left you with no way of getting it back. Starting with DOS 5.0, however, the FORMAT command ﬁrst determines whether the disk contains data. If the disk contains data, FORMAT saves a copy of the boot sector, FAT, and root direc- tory in a safe place on the disk. Then UNFORMAT can ﬁnd the information if you need to unformat the disk. You can unformat a disk only if you have not created or copied other ﬁles onto the disk.  In DOS 5.0  or later , the FORMAT command clears the disk’s FAT and the ﬁrst character of each ﬁlename in the root directory but does not erase any data. The program also scans the entire disk for bad sectors. FORMAT then saves the ﬁrst letter of each ﬁlename in a safe place on the disk.  FORMAT is a DOS command that can quickly wipe out the contents of a disk. This com- mand is safer than it used to be, but before you use it, make sure that you are familiar with its syntax and the way it works. FORMAT issues warning messages onscreen and prompts you for veriﬁcation before formatting a hard disk. Take care when you use FORMAT, read the screen prompts, and, most importantly, keep good backups of your data.  Also, the FORMAT command cannot format a disk that has been write-protected. If the command fails for this reason, determine what the disk contains before simply unpro- tecting the disk and proceeding with the format.  Formatting Floppy Disks  Most disks you buy today come preformatted. If not, then they must ﬁrst be formatted by DOS before using them. Some commands, such as DISKCOPY and BACKUP, stop and format disks if they’re given unformatted disks to work with, but few DOS commands are so accommodating.  The syntax for the FORMAT command is as follows: FORMAT d:  Q  V:label  F:size  S  B  C  U  1  4  8  N:sectors  T:tracks  This syntax shows all the switches available with the FORMAT command, but you normally use only a few of them at a time.  All the FORMAT switches are discussed in the section “Using FORMAT’s Switches,” later in this chapter.   You use the simplest version of the FORMAT command when you are formatting a ﬂoppy disk that has the maximum capacity of which the drive is capable, as in the following example: FORMAT A:  This command formats a nonbootable disk in the A: drive. If you are formatting a 360KB disk in a drive whose maximum capacity is 360KB, or if you are formatting a 1.2MB ﬂoppy in a high-density drive, ﬁne. If, however, you are formatting a 360KB disk in a 1.2MB drive,   Preparing Floppy Disks with the FORMAT Command  153  you have to give the FORMAT command that information. To tell the FORMAT command the desired format size of the disk, use the  F switch. The  F switch is followed by a colon  :  and the size of the disk to be formatted, as in the following line: FORMAT A:  F:360  This command formats a double-density 5 1 4-inch disk in a high-density drive. Similarly, the following formats a double-density 3 1 2-inch disk in a high-density drive: FORMAT A:  F:720  Remember, if you are formatting a high-density disk in a high-density drive, you do not have to give FORMAT the  F switch. Table 7.1 provides the valid values you can enter as part of the  F switch.  Table 7.1 Acceptable  F Switch Settings for Floppy Disks of Various Capacities  Size 160KB  180KB  320KB  360KB  720KB  1.20MB  1.44MB  2.88MB  Can Be Entered As  Select One  160  160KB  160K  180  320  360  720  1200  1440  2880  180K  320K  360K  720K  1200K  1440K  2880K  180KB  320KB  360KB  720KB  1200KB  1440KB  2880KB  1.2  1.44  2.88  1.2M  1.44M  2.88M  1.2MB  1.44MB  2.88MB  Telling the Capacity of Disks by Sight With 5 1 4-inch disks, you easily can tell the difference between 360KB disks and 1.2MB high-density disks: The 360KB disks have a plastic reinforcement ring around the large hole in the center of the disk, whereas high- density disks do not have a hub ring. Other than that small difference, however, they look the same.  When looking at 3 1 2-inch disks, you can easily identify 1.44MB high-density disks because they have a second square hole on the edge opposite the write-protect tab’s hole. A 720KB double-density disk has only one hole, for the write-protect tab.  You cannot arbitrarily decide to format a double-density disk as a high-density disk. If you try to format a 720KB disk as a high-density 1.44MB disk, DOS tells you how to proceed, as shown here: D:\>FORMAT B:  F:1440 Insert new diskette for drive B: and press ENTER when ready...  Part II Ch 7  Checking existing disk format. Existing format differs from that specified. This disk cannot be unformatted.   154  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Proceed with Format  Y N ?y Formatting 1.44M Invalid media or Track 0 bad - disk unusable. Format terminated. Format another  Y N ?  As you can see, DOS asks whether you want to format another disk. Just make sure it is a disk with a capacity matching the  F switch’s value.  Similarly, you cannot format a 2.88MB disk if your ﬂoppy drive doesn’t support it, even if you have a 2.88MB disk in hand. If you attempt this action, you see the following messages: D:\>FORMAT B:  F:2880 Insert new diskette for drive B: and press ENTER when ready...  Checking existing disk format. Existing format differs from that specified. This disk cannot be unformatted. Proceed with Format  Y N ?y Formatting 2.88M Parameters not supported by drive.  Other switches can be added to the command line to provide other formatting services. You can use the following command line, for example, to format a bootable 720KB disk in a 1.44MB drive: FORMAT B:  F:720  S  When you add the  S  System  switch, FORMAT creates a bootable disk.  FORMAT’s Other Tasks  The primary task of the FORMAT command is to divide the disk into logical storage sectors, but this task is not the command’s only purpose. FORMAT gives each disk a unique serial num- ber and prompts you for a volume label  name  for the disk. As the formatting proceeds, FORMAT continually updates what percentage of the disk has been formatted.  Assume for the moment that you have issued the command in the preceding section to for- mat a 720KB bootable disk. The following lines show the FORMAT dialog from start to ﬁnish: C:\>FORMAT B:  F:720  S Insert new diskette for drive B: and press ENTER when ready...  Checking existing disk format. Formatting 720K Format complete. System transferred  Volume label  11 characters, ENTER for none ? bootable  730,112 bytes total disk space 199,680 bytes used by system 530,432 bytes available on disk   Preparing Floppy Disks with the FORMAT Command  155  1,024 bytes in each allocation unit.  518 allocation units available on disk.  Volume Serial Number is 1F44-0EE0  Format another  Y N ?  When you press Enter to begin formatting, FORMAT ﬁrst displays a two-line prompt, telling you to enter a disk in drive B. Always make sure that this is what you intend. Next, FORMAT must perform several steps.  The ﬁrst of these steps is to check the disk format and preserve the FAT and directory struc- tures in case you need to use the UNFORMAT command. Formatting then begins, and FORMAT ticks off the percentage of completion until the format is ﬁnished. You are told that the for- mat is complete and nominally error free. If you use the  S switch, the boot sector is pre- pared, and the DOS system ﬁles are transferred to the disk.  You then are prompted to provide a volume label. Most users simply press Enter to bypass this option, but you can use the volume label to your advantage in creating a cataloging sys- tem for your disks. You might want to name ﬂoppy disks according to categories such as budget, correspondence, backups, and so on.  When you press Enter to leave the Volume label prompt, FORMAT displays some relevant numbers about the disk. The ﬁrst line shows the total capacity of the disk. If you create a bootable disk, the second line shows the amount of space taken up by the DOS system ﬁles. You also are shown the amount of remaining free space on the disk.  As you can tell by examining the information provided by FORMAT, the DOS system ﬁles take up almost 200KB of space on a newly formatted disk. Don’t use the  S switch care- lessly. This switch is intended only for the disks with which you plan to start the com- puter. Making disks bootable unnecessarily is a major waste of space.  FORMAT then provides you with numerical data on what it calls allocation units. In this context, saying allocation units is just a fancy way of saying clusters. Each sector is 512 bytes, and a ﬂoppy disk has two read write heads; therefore, a cluster is 1,024 bytes in length. The sec- ond line tells you that 518 clusters are available. Multiply 518 and 1,024, and you get 530,432, exactly the amount of free space shown by FORMAT.  As reliable as ﬂoppy disks are, they sometimes have ﬂaws. If you hear an unusual grind- ing or churning noise while formatting a disk, the disk is probably damaged or has an excessive number of ﬂaws. Any bad sectors found by FORMAT are reported as part of the numerical data.  Depending on the number of ﬂaws that are found, you might want to reformat the disk, throw it away, or use it only for noncritical storage.  Part II Ch 7   156  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness Just as you must occasionally clean the heads in a cassette deck or VCR, you should clean the read write heads in your ﬂoppy drives every once in a while. How often depends on whether you are getting errors on the drive, on the environment your computer lives in, and on how much you use the ﬂoppy drive.  Problems with reading a nearly full disk almost always indicate the need to clean the drive. Sectors near the hub are much closer together than the sectors of Track 1, and they are the ﬁrst to display errors related to unclean heads.  Computer retailers sell various disk drive cleaning products. Most have a cleaning pad encased in a ﬂoppy disk jacket. You squeeze a few drops of an alcohol-based cleaning ﬂuid onto the cleaning pad and insert the disk into the drive. To begin cleaning, you issue a command such as DIR A: that causes DOS to try to read the disk, and the heads are scraped clean. Check with your computer supply vendor for more information on ﬂoppy drive cleaning.  Because your hard disk is sealed at the factory, you never have to clean its heads. Don’t even think about it.  The last thing the FORMAT routine does is to assign a serial number to the disk. The purpose of a serial number is to enable programs to determine whether you have switched disks. The serial number, which is assigned automatically during formatting, uses the time and date of the format to create a hexadecimal number to be used as the serial number. No two disks from the same machine should ever have the same serial number, assuming that the system clock is properly set.  Finally, FORMAT offers to process another disk. By choosing this option, you can format more than one disk at a time. If you answer yes to the prompt by pressing Y and then Enter,  FORMAT prompts you to place another disk in the drive. Any subsequently formatted disks will have the same attributes as the command-line parameters you entered to start the com- mand. Only the serial numbers will be different.  Using FORMAT’s Switches  The FORMAT command responds to several switches that modify its behavior. Table 7.2 pro- vides a list of the available switches in the FORMAT syntax. Detailed information also is avail- able in Appendix F, “Command Reference.”  A True Story Computer retailers have many wonderful stories to tell. This incident happened in Florida.  A woman called the computer store and asked to speak to the manager. She was connected to the owner, who asked how he could help her. The following conversation ensued:  “I was just in a different store and bought a box of ﬂoppy disks.”  “Yes, ma’am.”  “Well, the salesman there suggested that I format all the disks in the box so that they would all be formatted when I need one.”  “That’s not a bad idea. Is there a problem?”  “Well, I don’t know. I barely got the third one in. I can’t imagine getting the fourth one in; it’s too tight, and there are 10 disks in the box.”   Preparing Floppy Disks with the FORMAT Command  157  “Can you hold on?”  Somehow the owner of the store managed to get the phone on hold before rolling out of his chair to the ﬂoor in a laughing ﬁt. Needless to say, all activity in the store stopped as employees and customers gathered around the owner to hear the resolution.  In the end, a service technician was dispatched to her place of business. The mangled disks were successfully removed without damaging the drive, and the owner charged her only half the normal service charge out of pity.  The moral of this story is that when you read that you can format more than one disk at a time, don’t take this advice literally.  Table 7.2 Commonly Used FORMAT Switches  Switch   B   F:size   N:sectors   T:tracks   Q   S   U   C   1   4   8  Action Allocates space on the formatted disk for system ﬁles by creating hidden ﬁles of the same name and size on track 0. Used to create disks that can be made bootable with DOS 4.01 and earlier versions.  Speciﬁes the size of the ﬂoppy disk to be formatted  such as 160, 180, 320, 360, 720, 1.2, 1.44, and 2.88 . You can specify kilobytes or megabytes if you prefer, but doing so is not necessary because DOS understands all the parameters shown here.  Performs a quick format on a previously formatted disk. This switch effectively and quickly erases the contents of a disk so that it can be used again.  Copies the system ﬁles and COMMAND.COM to the formatted disk, creating a bootable disk.  Performs an unconditional format so that the disk cannot be unformatted with UNFORMAT.  Enables you to specify the number of sectors per track  between 1 and 99 . This switch now is obsolete and has been replaced with the  F:size switch.  Speciﬁes the number of tracks per disk side  between 1 and 999 . This switch now is obsolete and has been replaced with the  F:size switch.  Retests a block previously marked as bad.  Creates single-sided disks. This switch now is obsolete.  Provides a shortcut for formatting a 5 1 4-inch 360KB ﬂoppy disk in a high-density drive. This switch does the same thing as specifying  F:360.  Creates disks that are compatible with early versions of DOS that used 8 sectors per track rather than the 9 or 15 used today. This switch now is obsolete.   V:label  Enables you to specify the volume label without waiting for a prompt.  The following sections describe some of the ways in which you can use the FORMAT com- mand’s switches.  Performing a Quick Format   Q  One way to clear all data from a disk is to format the disk. Because the formatting procedure can be relatively slow, the Quick Format feature was introduced.  Part II Ch 7   158  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Using a Quick Format saves you the hassle of changing the attributes of read-only ﬁles so that they can be deleted. A Quick Format also gets rid of directories without the laborious process of deleting all subordinate ﬁles and directories.  To clear data from a disk, type the command FORMAT  Q and then press Enter. If FORMAT can- not give a disk a Quick Format, a prompt appears, asking whether you want to do a regular format.  Performing an Unconditional Format   U  Unless you use the  U switch, the FORMAT command performs a safe format of previously for- matted disks. FORMAT ﬁrst determines whether a disk has been formatted. If the disk has been formatted, FORMAT clears the FAT, boot record, and root directory but does not erase any data. FORMAT then scans the entire disk for bad sectors and saves a copy of the FAT, boot record, and root directory to a MIRROR image ﬁle where the UNFORMAT command can ﬁnd them. If the disk has not been formatted previously, FORMAT overwrites every data byte with the hexadecimal value F6.  If you want DOS to overwrite all data on a previously formatted ﬂoppy disk  a procedure called unconditional formatting , use the  U switch. The following command, for example, unconditionally formats a disk in drive A: FORMAT A:  U  Adding System Files   S  If you want to use a disk to start your computer, the disk must contain hidden DOS system ﬁles as well as the command processor  COMMAND.COM . One way to install these system ﬁles on a disk is to use the  S switch during the formatting procedure. The  S switch reduces the disk’s available storage capacity by about 185KB.  ➔ For details on the  S switch, see Chapter 2, “Starting DOS,” p. 23.  Don’t use the  S switch with FORMAT unless you plan to create a disk from which you can boot. Having at least one bootable system disk as a backup is important in case the disk that contains your working copy of DOS fails or your hard drive develops errors.  Preparing the Hard Disk  Quite apart from the normal formatting that must be done to any DOS disk, hard disks require a little bit of extra work to get them ready for use. DOS provides the FDISK com- mand to prepare a hard disk to be formatted.  The following sections explain how DOS divides and formats a hard disk. If you are rela- tively inexperienced, be sure to heed all warnings and read all explanations carefully. You are moving into potentially dangerous territory when you start playing around with FDISK.   However, if you are determined to experiment with FDISK, make sure that you have a good backup of everything on the disk.  Preparing the Hard Disk  159  Many computer dealers preinstall DOS, Windows, and other programs you purchase. In all cases, you should have copies of these programs on their original ﬂoppy disks, or more common nowadays, CD-ROM. Without such disks, you do not have a legal copy of the program. If your dealer has installed an application, such as a word processing pro- gram, do not format the hard disk unless you also have a copy of the program on  CD-ROM or ﬂoppy disks. If you reformat your hard disk, all programs and data will be erased.  Dividing a Hard Disk with FDISK  Before you can format a hard disk, you must partition it—that is, divide the hard disk logi- cally into one or more areas called partitions. A partition is simply a section of the storage area of a hard disk. Many operating systems, including DOS, can use disk partitions, and most systems have some utility program that creates and manages partitions. In DOS, that utility program is the external command FDISK.  Many computer dealers use FDISK on a system’s hard disk before delivering the system to the user. In addition, FDISK is executed automatically by the DOS 6.22 Setup com- mand during installation. If your hard disk contains ﬁles, it has already been partitioned with FDISK and formatted. If you have any questions about your hard disk’s prepara- tion, consult your dealer.  Most hard disk users choose a DOS partition size that encompasses the entire hard disk. In other words, the one physical hard disk appears to DOS to be one logical hard disk. In this day of rapid growth in the size of the ordinary hard disk, you might want to rethink the idea of making a single volume out of a disk that might span many thousands of megabytes. You might ﬁnd it more manageable to have several partitions of smaller sizes.  DOS uses a partition table to store information on how the space on a hard disk is arranged. FDISK is the command that manipulates the information in the table.  Some PC users want to have both DOS and another operating system on their hard disk. Different operating systems use ﬁle systems that might not be compatible with DOS. Some operating systems, for example, can use ﬁle systems that are compatible with DOS-OS 2 and Windows NT. Some operating systems that have DOS-compatible ﬁle structures can use multiboot routines that give the user the opportunity to select which operating system to boot. The incompatibility comes into play only when you are using totally foreign oper- ating systems that must reside in different partitions. FDISK, however, only can create DOS partitions and reserve spaces on the disk; another operating system’s equivalent utility can be used to prepare the partition for its own ﬁle scheme.  Part II Ch 7   160  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  The partition table can be arranged so that DOS uses one partitioned section while another operating system, such as Unix, uses the other partitioned section. Through separation, each operating system sees its partition as its own hard disk. Only one of these partitions, how- ever, can be bootable. To use a partition with another operating system, you have to boot from a ﬂoppy when using the other operating system.  Fortunately, DOS installations that require a second operating system are rare. The rest of this chapter pertains to the 99.9% of installations in which DOS is the only operating sys- tem in use.  As you probably remember from an earlier chapter, DOS looks at disk drives as logical devices. A byproduct of this arrangement is the fact that you can use FDISK to carve up a sin- gle large hard disk into smaller, more manageable volumes. Each volume has its own drive letter and, for all practical purposes, becomes a separate hard disk.  Although making a large hard disk into a single logical drive might seem tempting, doing so might create some disadvantages. If your hard drive is especially large, any command that scans the entire drive, such as DIR or CHKDSK, might take an inordi- nately long time to complete execution. Files might become harder to ﬁnd due to their sheer numbers. Unless you work with very large data ﬁles, you might prefer to limit your logical drives to 120MB or smaller.  The FDISK command has no parameters. To start this utility, you simply type FDISK and press Enter.  In DOS 3.3 and later versions, you can use FDISK to create more than one DOS partition. After you create a primary DOS partition  or boot disk  with FDISK, you can create an extended DOS partition, which you can divide into one or more logical drives.  After you have created your partitions, you must use the FORMAT command to format all DOS partitions and logical drives before you can use them.  You can use the FDISK command to delete an existing partition from the disk partition table. If you delete an existing partition, you lose all data in the ﬁles contained in that partition. Be sure that you have backed up or copied any data from a partition that you want to delete. FDISK is not a command to experiment with unless your hard disk con- tains no data.  There are two types of partitions: the primary partition, from which the computer can boot, and an extended partition, which you can divide into logical drives. The primary DOS parti- tion is normally assigned the drive name C. The extended partition can be used to create drives D, E, F, and so on.   Preparing the Hard Disk  161  After you partition the hard disk, DOS treats the logical drives as separate drives and creates a ﬁle system for each when the drive is formatted. Figure 7.2 shows the opening screen that appears when you run FDISK.  Figure 7.2 FDISK partitions your hard disk so that DOS can use it efﬁciently.

You won’t destroy the data on your disk if you accidentally choose this option; FDISK will simply beep and inform you that you have already created partitions.  The third choice enables you to delete partitions. Unless something is wrong with your system or you are deliberately reconﬁguring a drive, leave this one alone! Deleting parti- tions results in data loss.  To see how your hard disk is partitioned, press 4 to select Display Partition Information and then press Enter. FDISK presents a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 7.3. The infor- mation shown by your computer, of course, will be different.  Figure 7.3 shows the FDISK display output for the hard disk that was used in writing this chapter. Note that this disk has two partitions, both dedicated to DOS format. The ﬁrst acts as the C: drive. The A under status indicates that it is the active partition and that it can be used for booting. This drive—drive C—is 32MB in size, uses the standard DOS FAT 16-bit architecture, and takes up only 10% of the hard disk’s available space.

The size of each of the logical drives is shown and marked as having the standard DOS ﬁle allocation table. The Usage column indicates the relative sizes in relation to the partition, not the disk as a whole. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that the usage numbers add up to only 99%; FDISK rounds off fractional percentages.  By examining the information in Figures 7.3 and 7.4, you can tell that the drive has 321MB of usable capacity broken into six drive letters, C: through H:. The rationale behind these settings and the relative sizes of the drives is as follows.  Drive C takes the biggest pounding. Because it is the boot drive, almost every commercial software package you install tries to make changes or install drivers on the C: drive. C: also is the traditional home of the DOS directory in which DOS’s external command program ﬁles are written and of directories used to store utility programs such as Norton Utilities and PC Tools. Plus, C: usually houses a TEMP directory, where many software packages look for disk resources to use as a scratch pad. Windows Print Manager, for example, uses the TEMP directory to spool printing jobs into a ﬁle so that it can send data to the printer in the background. The drive is just large enough to accommodate all these uses and provide space to install software for testing, yet it’s small enough to back up easily. Unproven software sometimes eats the disk it’s installed on, so easy restoration of backup ﬁles is a key factor in the size of the C: drive.  Drive D on the hard disk is the Windows drive. Windows software tends to be large, as is Windows itself. When you use DoubleSpace, the 100MB of reported space becomes closer to 200MB—almost enough to do the job. Drives E and F store applications and the over- ﬂow from drive D. On drives E and F, you ﬁnd word processors, programming editors, communications programs, and so on. Drive G is given over to graphics programs and ﬁles. Drive H is a programming disk where source code to programs is written. Source code is the term used for the ﬁles that contain programming language statements compiled into work- ing EXE and COM ﬁles.  As you can see, the partitions of this hard disk have been thought out in advance. Utilizing disk space effectively is the ﬁrst step in optimizing DOS’s efﬁciency. Before you partition a hard disk, analyze the ways in which you use a computer. If you do desktop publishing, use Windows; if you do database work on large ﬁles, you might want to partition the disk into fewer drives with larger capacities. One key point to keep in mind is that partitions should be small enough to enable you to make backups easily.  Checking Partition Status You can check the status of your partition table by using the FDISK command’s  STATUS switch as follows: FDISK  STATUS  FDISK shows a table of your hard disk’s partition information without starting the FDISK program  see Figure 7.5 .  Part II Ch 7   164  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Figure 7.5 Displaying disk parti- tion information.

Performing the steps given in the example will destroy the data on your hard disk. Do not practice these steps unless you have reliable backups of all the data on all the drives of your hard disk. If you can, practice ﬁrst on a hard disk that is not cur- rently loaded with data.  Partitioning a Drive  The steps required for partitioning a hard disk for the ﬁrst time and those required for repartitioning a drive to change the structures of the logical drives are very similar.  If you are repartitioning an existing hard disk structure, make sure that you have a rock- solid backup of all the ﬁles on the disk. If you plan to change the sizes of logical drives, back up individual directories rather than perform a whole-drive backup.  The actions shown in this section should be performed only by experienced users of DOS. Not knowing what you are doing can cost you all the ﬁles on your hard disk. After you have your backups safely stored away and have a bootable ﬂoppy containing FDISK and FORMAT, follow these steps to repartition your hard disk:  1. Plan the partitions. Decide how you want the partitioning to be done. Create a chart  on paper and apportion the available disk space among the partitions you want to create.  2. Start FDISK. If you are repartitioning a drive that is currently partitioned, choose to  delete existing partitions from the main FDISK menu. After the existing partitions have been deleted, the drive will be unusable until you repartition and reformat.   Preparing the Hard Disk  165  3. Create the primary partition. Select Create DOS Partition from the FDISK main  screen. If the drive does not have any existing partitions, a menu appears. Choose 1 to create the partition to act as drive C. By default, FDISK offers the entire disk capacity for the primary partition. If you want to break the hard drive into multiple logical drives, answer N to the conﬁrmation prompt and press Enter. FDISK enables you to enter capacities for partitions as megabytes or as a percentage. Choose one method or the other, and then assign the amount of space you want C: to have and return to the main FDISK menu.  4. Make the primary partition the active partition. Choose Set Active Partition from  the FDISK main menu to make C: the active partition to be made bootable.  5. Create the extended partition. Again, choose Create from the main menu, but this  time choose to Create Extended DOS partition. Again, FDISK offers to make the remaining disk space the size of the partition. If you want just C: and D:, accept the default. If you want to create more than one logical drive, reject the default and follow the prompts to specify the size of the partition to be used for D:.  6. Create logical drives. If you ﬁnish creating a partition and disk sectors still are not assigned to a partition, FDISK loops around to create another logical drive. It offers to use all remaining space for the logical drive. If you want to break the remaining space into more than one drive, answer N to reject the default and enter a value manually. When you create the last logical drive, accept the default to make sure that no usable cylinders are left out of the partition table.  7. Format each logical drive. After you have set up the partitions the way you want  them, exit FDISK and save the partition table. Reboot the computer using your bootable ﬂoppy and then format each of the logical drives you have created. Remember to for- mat C: using the  S switch to make it bootable.  8. Reboot and check the drives. After you have formatted each of the logical drives,  reboot the computer from the hard disk and run directories of all the logical drives to make sure that they were created the way you intended and that they are recognized as valid DOS drives.  9. Install ﬁles. If you are repartitioning a drive or installing a new hard disk on an existing system, restore all the backups you made, including the DOS ﬁles on the boot drive and the ﬁles in the DOS directory. If you are installing a new system, install DOS and then begin installing any software packages that have to reside on the hard disk of the computer.  10. Test, test, test. Before you pronounce the job ﬁnished, reboot from the hard disk,  test all the software that you installed, and make sure that all conﬁguration ﬁles, dri- vers, and so on are actually written at the locations speciﬁed by entries in CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Part II Ch 7   166  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Formatting a Hard Disk  Simply stated, you format a hard disk or logical drive just like you format a ﬂoppy disk.  Assume that the hard disk  or logical disk  you are going to format is drive C.  If you are formatting another drive, use its drive letter in place of C in the example.  If your drive is not the primary DOS partition, you don’t have to use the  S switch; DOS boots only from the primary DOS partition. To format drive C, follow these steps:  1. Insert your working copy of the DOS Startup disk—or any bootable disk that contains  FORMAT.COM—into drive A.  2. Switch to that drive by typing A: and pressing Enter. 3. Type the following command and press Enter:  FORMAT C: S FORMAT issues the following warning message and conﬁrmation prompt: WARNING, ALL DATA ON NON-REMOVABLE DISK DRIVE C: WILL BE LOST! Proceed with Format  Y N ?  This prompt is extremely important. When the prompt appears onscreen, examine it carefully to conﬁrm the disk-drive name  letter  before you press Y. If you make a habit of pressing Y in response to the conﬁrmation prompts of less dangerous commands, you might make a serious mistake with this ﬁnal FORMAT conﬁrmation prompt.  4. If the speciﬁed drive is the one you want to format, press Y; if not, press N to terminate FORMAT. If you press Y, FORMAT updates the display with progress reports on the format- ting operation. Depending on the size of the disk that is being formatted, the process can take from just a few minutes to more than half an hour. The greater a disk’s capac- ity, the longer the process takes.  All the normal Format complete and System transferred messages that you see when for- matting ﬂoppies also are presented when you are formatting a hard disk.  Disk Commands  Naming Disks with LABEL  Several useful DOS commands can help you prepare and maintain disks. The following sec- tions are devoted to these commands.  The external command LABEL adds, modiﬁes, or changes a disk’s volume label. In DOS, a volume label is a name given to a physical or logical disk.  If a disk’s volume label is blank  if you or another user pressed Enter when FORMAT or LABEL prompted for the label , you can use the LABEL command to add a volume label or change the current volume label.   Disk Commands  167  DOS displays the volume label when you issue commands such as VOL, CHKDSK, DIR, and TREE. Giving each disk—physical or logical—a volume label is a good idea. A disk with a unique volume label is easier to identify than one that doesn’t have a label.  The syntax for the LABEL command is as follows: LABEL d:label  d: is the name of the drive that holds the disk you want to label.  label, the optional label text that you supply as the new volume label, can include up to 11 characters. DOS immediately updates the speciﬁed or default drive’s label with no warning prompt. If you do not supply the label parameter, LABEL automatically goes into an interac- tive mode that prompts you for a new label.  Keep in mind this special restriction: You cannot use the LABEL command in a networked drive.  Examining Volume Labels with VOL  The internal command VOL is convenient when you want to view a disk’s volume label or verify that a label exists. VOL accesses the disk’s volume label from the root directory and then displays the label that was created during the disk’s formatting or modiﬁed by a subse- quent LABEL command.  You can use VOL freely because it is a display-only command; it does not change any ﬁles or the label name.  The syntax of the VOL command is simple: VOL d:  d: is the optional name of the drive whose volume label you want to see. If you omit a value for d:, DOS displays the label for the default drive.  Using SYS to Transfer the DOS System  All DOS disks have a DOS ﬁle system, but only disks with the DOS system ﬁles and COM- MAND.COM can be used to start the computer. The external command SYS transfers  copies  the hidden system ﬁles necessary to make a disk bootable.  As you learned earlier in this chapter, you can make a disk bootable by using the  S switch with the FORMAT command. You can use the SYS command when you need to make an already formatted disk bootable. The disk must have room for the system ﬁles that SYS intends to transfer, and those system ﬁles must be compatible with your version of DOS.  To use SYS successfully, observe the following rules:    The destination disk must be formatted.   The destination disk must contain sufﬁcient free space for the two hidden system ﬁles  and COMMAND.COM  just more than 133KB for DOS 6.22 system ﬁles; more than 197KB if  Part II Ch 7   168  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  you use DoubleSpace , it must already contain earlier versions of the system ﬁles, or it must have been formatted with the  B switch.    You cannot use SYS in a networked drive. If you want to use SYS in a networked drive, you must log off the network or pause your drive.  For the exact restrictions, consult your system’s network documentation.     You must include the destination-drive parameter in the SYS command. SYS does not transfer a copy of the system to the current drive; the destination must be a different drive.  The syntax for the SYS command is as follows: SYS ds: dd:  dd: is the target, or destination, drive for the system ﬁles. You must specify a drive name  letter  for drive dd:. The drive speciﬁed by ds: is the drive used for the source of the sys- tem ﬁles.  Suppose that you are using DOS 6.22 with a hard disk and have an empty disk that you want to make bootable for use with another computer. To do so, follow these steps:  1. Insert the formatted disk  the one you want to transfer system ﬁles onto  into drive A. 2. Type the following command:  SYS C: A:  SYS replies with the message System transferred. The system ﬁles now are on the disk in drive A. Now you can use this disk to boot your computer.  The C: in step 2 is optional, depending on whether drive C is current. If you are logged on to drive C, C: is already the default source for the system ﬁles; therefore, you don’t have to add it to the command line.  Getting the Most Speed from Your Hard Disk Your hard disk just might be the most important component of your computer. Many aspects of your computer’s performance are strongly inﬂuenced by the characteristics of your disk. These characteristics include the following:    Speed—The speed of your hard disk inﬂuences the speed of your system. Even if your computer’s processor is super fast, a slow disk can make your computer perform like a snail.    Space—The amount of space on your disk determines what you can do with your com-  puter. No matter how fast and powerful your processor is, if you have only 20MB of space on your disk, you cannot run much Windows software.   Getting the Most Speed from Your Hard Disk  169  The most dramatic way to increase your computer’s performance is to purchase a larger, faster hard disk. As an alternative to buying another hard disk, you often can increase your computer’s performance simply by making the best use of your current hard disk. In the fol- lowing sections, you learn how to get the most speed and most space from your hard disk. The safety issue is covered thoroughly in Chapter 9, “Protecting Your Data.”  The programs you use on your computer frequently must access data on disk. The speed at which your computer can retrieve that information is one of the most signiﬁcant factors that determine how fast the computer operates. You can buy faster disk drives  which are expen- sive , or you can use DOS, which provides several techniques you can use to increase the speed at which your programs access information without actually increasing the speed of your disk. The following sections explain those techniques.  Using a Disk Cache  SMARTDrive   Perhaps the most signiﬁcant way to enhance the performance of your hard disk is to use a disk-caching program. Disk caching takes advantage of the fact that during the course of normal work, most users access the same programs and data repeatedly within a short period. You might list the contents of a ﬁle, edit the ﬁle, and then print it; or you might run the same program several times in a row. Even if you don’t access programs or data repeat- edly, the programs you use probably do.  If you have a disk-caching program installed, that program allocates some of your memory for temporary data storage on disk. When you access data, the disk-caching program saves that data in its memory area, on the assumption that you are likely to use the same data—or related data stored with it—in the near future  within a few seconds, perhaps . If you  or your program  do try to read the same data again soon, the disk-caching program intercepts the disk access and gives the program the data stored in memory. You  or your program  receive the data immediately because DOS doesn’t actually read the data from disk; instead, the disk-caching program ﬁnds the data in its cache buffer. If your program never requests the same information again, the caching program eventually realizes that you are not likely to use that data soon and deletes the data from memory.  The disk-caching program that comes with DOS is named SMARTDRV.EXE, or simply SMARTDrive. SMARTDrive builds its buffer area in XMS or EMS memory, using very lit- tle conventional memory. When DOS reads information from the disk, it places that infor- mation in the cache and sends speciﬁcally requested information to the program that requested it. SMARTDrive, however, reads more information than the program requests and stores this information in memory. If the program later requests information that is already in memory, the cache can supply the information faster than DOS can if DOS has  to read the disk again.  SMARTDrive eliminates redundant disk writing by putting information on disk only when the data differs from data already stored. The program also accumulates information, writ- ing out data only when a certain amount has accumulated. Write-caching operations decrease the amount of time that your programs spend writing to disk, but write caching  Part II Ch 7   170  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  also forces you to shut down your computer by issuing a special SMARTDrive command  explained later in this section  or by making sure you return to the DOS prompt.  You might not want to use write caching in an area with unreliable electrical power. If the power fails while SMARTDrive is accumulating data, you lose the data that it has not yet written to disk. This risk of data loss is of little concern if you own an uninterruptible power supply  UPS , which keeps your computer running during a power failure. There is no equivalent danger in the case of read caching.  A disk-caching program such as SMARTDrive remembers which sections of the disk you have used most frequently. When the cache must be recycled, the program retains the data in the most frequently used areas and discards the data in the less frequently used areas. In a random disk-access operation in which program and data ﬁles are scattered uniformly across the disk, the cache method of recycling the least frequently used area is more efﬁcient than the buffer method of recycling the oldest area. A cache tends to keep in memory the most heavily used areas of the disk.  To start SMARTDrive, enter a command with the following syntax in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle: SMARTDRV drive+  drive-...  E:elementsize initcachesize wincachesize   B:buffersize  C  R  F  N  L  Q  S  U  V  X  The SMARTDRV command is followed by the drives for which you want caching used. This notation takes the form of a drive letter, followed optionally by a plus  +  or minus  –  sign, as in the following examples:  C C+ C–  Speciﬁes that drive C will be cached for reads but not for writes Speciﬁes that drive C will be cached for reads and writes Speciﬁes that drive C will not be cached  If you don’t specify any drive letters in your SMARTDRV command, ﬂoppy disk drives are  read cached but not write cached, and hard disks are read cached and write cached. If you are using the version of SMARTDrive supplied with DOS 6.22, you also can cache your CD-ROM drives. Other kinds of drives—such as network drives and compressed drives— are not cached.  As an alternative to specifying every drive you want read cached but not write cached, you can use the  X switch. SMARTDrive then enables only read caching; write caching for all drives is automatically disabled. The  X switch is used automatically when you install DOS 6.22  unless you were using SMARTDrive with different switches in an existing AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle .  The  E:elementsize parameter speciﬁes the number of bytes that SMARTDrive reads or writes at a time: 1,024; 2,048; 4,096; or 8,192  the default value . The larger the value, the more conventional memory SMARTDrive uses, but the fewer disk accesses you are likely to need.   Getting the Most Speed from Your Hard Disk  171  The initcachesize parameter is a number that speciﬁes the size  in kilobytes  of the cache when SMARTDrive starts. The larger the cache, the more likely that SMARTDrive can ﬁnd information required by programs in the cache. The larger the cache, however, the more memory SMARTDrive requires. If you do not specify initcachesize, SMARTDrive selects a value based on the amount of memory in your system.  The wincachesize parameter speciﬁes the size  in kilobytes  to which DOS can reduce the cache when you start Windows so that Windows can use the memory for other purposes. The philosophy behind this parameter is that if SMARTDrive uses too much of your mem- ory, Windows runs too slowly. Therefore, even though SMARTDrive becomes less efﬁcient by giving up some of its memory, Windows can run faster. When you exit Windows, SMARTDrive recovers the memory it gave up for Windows. Table 7.3 shows the default values for initcachesize and wincachesize.  Table 7.3 Default SMARTDrive Memory Values  Default Value for initcachesize All XMS  Default Value for wincachesize Zero  no caching   Size of Extended Memory Up to 1MB  Up to 2MB  Up to 4MB  Up to 6MB  6MB or more  1MB  1MB  2MB  2MB  256KB  512KB  1MB  2MB  The  B:buffersize parameter tells SMARTDrive how much additional information to read when DOS executes a disk read. Because programs often read sequentially through ﬁles, SMARTDrive anticipates that the next data request will be for the area following the cur- rent area. The default size of the read-ahead buffer is 16KB; this value can be any multiple of elementsize. The larger the value of buffersize, the more conventional memory SMARTDrive uses.  The  L switch prevents SMARTDrive from loading into your upper memory area  UMA . This option might be useful if other programs need to use the UMA.  Normally, the DOS 6.22 version of SMARTDrive enables read caching for CD-ROM drives. If you do not want this feature enabled, you can use the  U switch.  The  Q switch tells SMARTDrive to be “quiet” while installing itself rather than displaying the usual status messages. This is the opposite of the  V switch, which turns on “verbose” mode and shows the status messages.  You also can run SMARTDrive as a command from the DOS prompt. Several special switches that provide important features are available from the command line. The ﬁrst is  Part II Ch 7   172  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  the  S switch. You determine the status of SMARTDrive by using this switch. Following is an example of typical output: Microsoft SMARTDrive Disk Cache version 5.0 Copyright 1991,1993 Microsoft Corp.  Room for    256 elements of   8,192 bytes each There have been   3,251 cache hits  and    524 cache misses  Cache size:  2,097,152 bytes Cache size while running Windows:  2,097,152 bytes  Disk Caching Status  drive   read cache   write cache   buffering ----------------------  A:       yes           no           no B:       yes           no           no C:       yes           yes          no D        yes           yes          no I*       yes           yes          no  * DoubleSpace drive cached via host drive. Write behind data will be committed before command prompt returns.  For help, type “Smartdrv  ?”.  Perhaps the most interesting information in this output is the speed that SMARTDrive achieves. In the preceding example  which was generated after a session with a word pro- cessing program , for 3,251 disk accesses, SMARTDrive already had the data in its cache. For only 524 attempted disk accesses did SMARTDrive actually have to access the disk. In other words, because of SMARTDrive, the computer didn’t have to perform 80% of attempted disk accesses.  The  C switch is important if you use write caching. Remember that write caching causes SMARTDrive to accumulate data that is destined for the disk until a certain amount accu- mulates. If you are getting ready to turn off your computer, you must tell SMARTDrive that no more data is to be written to disk and instruct the program to ﬁnish writing whatever data it has accumulated. You can perform this operation  called ﬂushing in technical circles  by typing the following command: SMARTDRV  C  You do not need to execute this command if you are rebooting by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del. But if you have enabled write caching, be sure to use this command when you reset or turn off your computer.  If you are using DOS 6.22, the precaution of using the  C switch is not necessary. Instead, SMARTDrive automatically ﬂushes the write buffer to disk whenever you return to the DOS prompt. This assumes, of course, that you have not disabled the feature by using the  N switch.  Typically, you should disable this feature only if you are doing extensive batch ﬁle operations and don’t want the continual buffer ﬂushing to degrade the performance of   Getting the Most Speed from Your Hard Disk  173  your batch ﬁles.  If you turn off this feature by using the  N switch, you can turn it on later by using the  F switch.  Using FASTOPEN  Another way to improve hard disk performance is to use the FASTOPEN program. FASTOPEN is not a device driver per se, but an executable program that you can include in AUTOEXEC.BAT. You also can load the program through CONFIG.SYS by using the special INSTALL command.  ➔ For more information on using the INSTALL command, see “Using the INSTALL Command,” p. 466.  You can use FASTOPEN only with hard drives. FASTOPEN caches directory information, holding in memory the locations of frequently used ﬁles and directories.  A directory is a type of ﬁle that you cannot access through regular means. DOS reads and writes directories in a manner similar to the way it handles other ﬁles. Part of the directory entry for a ﬁle or subdirectory holds the starting point for the ﬁle in the ﬁle allocation table. Because DOS typically holds the FAT in the disk buffers, FASTOPEN was developed to hold directory entries in memory.  FASTOPEN is not a complex command, but you must do a little work before you can use it effectively. The syntax for FASTOPEN is as follows: FASTOPEN.EXE d: = n  X  The d: parameter is the name of the ﬁrst hard drive that you want FASTOPEN to track.  You can specify up to 24 hard disks or hard disk partitions at one time.  The  X switch, which is similar to the  X switches of other commands, enables FASTOPEN information to reside in EMS. By default, FASTOPEN uses conventional memory.  The n parameter is the number of directory entries that FASTOPEN is to cache. Each ﬁle or subdirectory requires one directory entry. You can enter a value ranging from 10 to 999. If you do not specify a value for n, DOS uses a default value of 48.  You can use FASTOPEN on as many disks as you want. Be aware, however, that the total num- ber of directory entries or fragmented entries FASTOPEN can handle is 999. If you issue the command for several disk drives, the sum of the n values cannot exceed 999. The practical limit of n is between 100 and 200 per disk. If you specify a value much higher, DOS wades through the internal directory entries more slowly than it reads information from disk. Additionally, each directory entry stored in memory takes 48 bytes. Considering this trade- off of speed and memory, the 100-to-200-disk limit yields adequate performance.  Using too small a number for n also can be a disadvantage. When directory entries are recy- cled, FASTOPEN discards the least recently used entry when it needs space for a new entry. If the n value is too small, DOS discards entries that it still might need. The objective is to have enough entries in memory so that FASTOPEN operates efﬁciently, but not so many entries that FASTOPEN wastes time wading through directory entries.  Part II Ch 7   174  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  To load FASTOPEN as part of your regular conﬁguration, use the INSTALL command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle as follows: INSTALL = FASTOPEN.EXE C:  To load FASTOPEN into upper memory, use LOADHIGH in AUTOEXEC.BAT. The following com- mand, for example, loads FASTOPEN into upper memory and tracks ﬁlenames and directories on drive C: LOADHIGH C:\DOS\FASTOPEN C:  Keep in mind the following points regarding the use of FASTOPEN:    Do not use FASTOPEN if you are using Windows.    Do not run a disk-defragmenting program, such as DEFRAG, while FASTOPEN is  running.  Using a RAM Disk  Another way to speed disk operation doesn’t involve a disk at all. A RAM disk is a device driver that uses a portion of your computer’s memory to emulate a disk drive. You use a RAM drive as you use any other disk drive. Because this “imitation,” or virtual, disk is located in RAM, a RAM disk is extremely fast compared with a real disk drive. You must, however, give up a signiﬁcant amount of memory to create a useful RAM disk. Worse, you cannot store anything in that disk permanently; the contents of the RAM disk disappear when you turn off or reboot your computer.  As a general rule, a disk-caching program such as SMARTDrive provides better overall per- formance gains than a RAM disk. You generally use RAM disks to enhance the performance of one or two speciﬁc programs that read and write to the disk frequently or that use over- lays. A disk cache, on the other hand, improves the performance of all programs that read and write to disk.  If your computer’s memory resources are limited, give more consideration to a disk cache rather than to a RAM disk.  Overlays and RAM Disks Some programs are too large to ﬁt in your PC’s memory. These programs load a core part into memory and access additional parts from overlay ﬁles as necessary. When a new section of the program is needed, the appropriate overlay for that section is read from the disk into the area occupied by the current overlay.  The term overlay comes from this process of overlaying sections of program space in memory with new sec- tions. RAM disks facilitate rapid switching of active overlays because the overlay disk ﬁles actually are in mem- ory, not on disk. You must copy any needed overlay ﬁles to the RAM disk before starting the program. You also must conﬁgure the program to look for its overlays on the RAM disk.   Getting the Most Speed from Your Hard Disk  175  The RAM disk driver that comes with DOS is named RAMDRIVE.SYS. To install RAMDRIVE and create a virtual disk, include RAMDRIVE.SYS as a device driver in CONFIG.SYS. The syntax for including RAMDRIVE.SYS is as follows: DEVICE = RAMDRIVE.SYS disksize sectorsize entries  E  A  The disksize parameter indicates the size of the RAM disk  in kilobytes . This number can range from 16 to 32,767  equivalent to 32MB . The default value is 64.  The sectorsize parameter represents the size of the sectors used in the virtual disk. You can specify one of three sector sizes: 128, 256, or 512  the default  bytes. Normally, you do not change this parameter; if you do, however, you also must specify the disksize parameter.  The entries parameter determines the maximum number of directory entries permitted  in the RAM disk’s root directory. This parameter can be a value ranging from 2 to 1,024.  The default value is 64. You normally don’t need to change this parameter. If you do specify the entries parameter, you also must enter the disksize and sectorsize parameters. Set the number of directories based on the size of the RAM disk and the number of ﬁles you are storing.  By default, DOS creates a RAM disk in conventional memory. You can, however, include the  E switch to cause the RAM disk to be created in XMS memory. Even with this switch, how- ever, RAMDRIVE uses some conventional memory, so you might want to try loading the  RAMDRIVE.SYS device driver into upper memory. The following command creates a 1,024KB RAM disk in XMS memory and loads the device driver into upper memory: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS 1024  E  If you want your RAM disk to use extended memory, it must follow the CONFIG.SYS commands that load HIMEM.SYS or a different memory manager.  The  A switch creates the RAM disk in EMS memory. To use this switch, you must load an expanded memory manager  such as EMM386.EXE  before loading RAMDRIVE.SYS. You cannot use the  A and  E switches for the same RAM disk. You can create different RAM disks, however, some using EMS memory and others using XMS memory. Given a choice, use XMS memory.  After you insert the DEVICE=RAMDRIVE.SYS command into CONFIG.SYS and reboot your com- puter, DOS displays a message similar to the following during initialization of your com- puter: Microsoft RAMDrive version 3.07 virtual disk D:  Disk size: 64k Sector size: 512 bytes Allocation unit: 1 sectors Directory entries: 64  Part II Ch 7   176  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Most importantly, this message tells you that this RAM disk is accessed as drive D. The message also shows the disk size, sector size, allocation-unit  cluster  size, and maximum number of root directory entries.  The amount of RAM in your computer, the programs you use, and the convenience of a RAM disk help determine what size RAM disk you use and even whether you need to use a RAM disk at all.  Drive Letters and Block Devices The logical disk drive names  the drive letters  that DOS assigns to disks created by RAMDRIVE.SYS and DRIVER.SYS  see the “Command Reference”  depend on the placement of the commands in the CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. You might try to use the wrong disk drive name if you do not know how DOS assigns drive names. When DOS encounters a block device driver  that is, any device that transfers data in blocks rather than in bytes , DOS assigns the next highest drive letter to that device. The order is ﬁrst come, ﬁrst assigned.  The potential for confusion comes when several block device drivers are loaded. The order of loading, based on the order of the commands in the CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, determines the names assigned by DOS. If you load RAMDRIVE.SYS ﬁrst and DRIVER.SYS second, the RAM disk might be named D and the DRIVER.SYS disk one letter higher. If you switch the lines so that DRIVER.SYS loads ﬁrst, the disk drive names also switch; the DRIVER.SYS disk is D, and the RAM disk is E.  One excellent way to use a RAM disk is to assign the TEMP environment variable to this virtual drive. Certain programs use an environment variable named TEMP to determine where to create various temporary ﬁles. These temporary ﬁles usually are written and read frequently during the operation of the program; their temporary nature makes them good candidates for storage in a RAM disk.  To assign TEMP to a RAM disk, you ﬁrst have to determine a name for the virtual disk and then use the SET command  see the “Command Reference” . Assign the TEMP variable to a subdirectory rather than to the RAM disk’s root directory to avoid the 64-ﬁlename limit. Assuming that the RAM disk becomes drive D, use the following commands in AUTOEXEC.BAT to create a directory on the virtual disk and to cause temporary ﬁles to be written to that directory: MD D:\TEMPDATA SET TEMP = D:\TEMPDATA  Some programs use an environment variable named TMP instead of TEMP for the same pur- pose. In such a case, substitute TMP for TEMP in the preceding command.  Because RAM disks are memory-based devices, you lose their contents when you reboot or turn off your PC. To prevent data loss, you must copy the contents of a RAM disk to a conventional disk ﬁle before rebooting or turning off the power. If you  or your pro- gram  are creating or modifying RAM disk ﬁles, copy the ﬁles to an actual disk regularly in case a power failure occurs.   Getting the Most Speed from Your Hard Disk  177  Defragmenting Your Disk  If all you ever did with your hard disk was add ﬁles, the space available on your disk would be used very efﬁciently. DOS would add one ﬁle and then another to your disk, with each ﬁle being stored entirely within a contiguous area, followed by another contiguous ﬁle, an arrangement that enables DOS to access your ﬁles very efﬁciently.  Nobody, however, only adds new ﬁles to a disk. As you use your disk, you add new ﬁles, delete existing ﬁles, and add new data to existing ﬁles. Over time, data becomes scattered over the disk, and even the data within a single ﬁle might reside in chunks throughout the disk. This scattering of data is called fragmentation. The following sections discuss fragmen- tation in detail.  Understanding the Effects of Fragmentation The more fragmented your disk, the slower your computer runs. Suppose that a third of your hard disk is currently full and that all the used space is at the front of the disk so that you have no fragmentation. Whenever you request data from the disk, the disk heads do not have to move very far and can access your data quickly.  If the same data is spread across the disk, however, the disk heads might have to move across the entire disk to access data. The longer movement requires more time, and you might notice the difference. Moreover, the disk might require more time to access each individual ﬁle. When you run a program  at least, a program that doesn’t use overlays , DOS must read the program from disk into memory. That operation is much faster if the entire program is in successive locations on the disk and much slower if the disk heads must move to widely separated locations on the disk.  Fragmentation, which is almost inevitable, tends to increase the longer you use your disk. Programs that defragment your disk—that is, move all the data to the beginning of the disk and store each ﬁle’s data in the same place—have long been available from third-party soft- ware vendors. The following section discusses DOS’s built-in defragmentation program.  Understanding the Basic Operation of DEFRAG DOS 6.0 was the ﬁrst version of DOS to come with a defragmentation program, called DEFRAG. You execute DEFRAG by typing the following at the DOS prompt: DEFRAG  A dialog box appears, asking which drive you want to defragment  see Figure 7.6 .  Figure 7.6 The DEFRAG disk selection dialog box.  Part II Ch 7   178  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Select a drive by clicking a drive letter. Alternatively, use the arrow keys to move to the desired drive and then press Enter. DEFRAG scans the selected drive and displays a map of the used and unused portions. You need not understand the map to use DEFRAG effectively, but if you’re interested in understanding DEFRAG’s analysis of your disk, study the legend at the bottom-right corner of the screen; it explains the symbols in the disk map.  After displaying the map, DEFRAG suggests one of the following courses of action:    Do Nothing—If the disk is not fragmented, DEFRAG tells you that you don’t need to  perform any operation.    Defragment Files Only—If most of the data in the used area of the disk is stored  together but the individual ﬁles are scattered throughout that area, DEFRAG recommends that you defragment the ﬁles. After DEFRAG completes this operation, the same area of the disk is in use, but the data in that area is rearranged so that the data for each ﬁle is stored together. DEFRAG usually recommends this operation for disks that are mostly full.   Full Optimization—If the used area of the disk is scattered across the disk, DEFRAG rec- ommends that you perform a full optimization, meaning that you defragment the entire disk. DEFRAG rearranges the used areas on the disk so that all the used portion of the disk is at the beginning of the disk and the data for each ﬁle is stored contiguously.  Figure 7.7 shows a typical recommendation from DEFRAG.  Figure 7.7 Viewing the DEFRAG command’s analysis and recommendation.  If you choose Optimize, DEFRAG reorganizes your disk using the suggested method. Be pre- pared to wait. Although DEFRAG does its work quickly, it still might take a long time on a large, heavily fragmented disk.  When DEFRAG suggests a particular type of defragmentation, you do not have to accept its recommendation. When it recommends that only the ﬁles be defragmented, for example, it is telling you that the extra efﬁciency you gain by performing a disk defragmentation is not worth the time required by DEFRAG. However, you might be willing to allow DEFRAG the extra time to perform the more complete disk defragmentation.   Getting the Most Speed from Your Hard Disk  179  As Figure 7.7 shows, when DEFRAG makes a recommendation, you can click Conﬁgure to select various options that control how DEFRAG works. When you click Conﬁgure, DEFRAG presents the Optimize menu, which includes more operations than just conﬁguration; the ﬁrst item tells DEFRAG to begin the defragmentation procedure. Table 7.4 lists the functions available in the Optimize menu.  Table 7.4  The DEFRAG Optimize  Conﬁguration  Menu  Selection Begin Optimization  Meaning Begins optimization of your hard disk, using any conﬁguration options you have selected  Drive  Enables you to choose the drive you want to optimize  Optimization Method  Enables you to choose full optimization or ﬁle only  might leave empty space between ﬁles   File Sort  Map Legend  About Defrag  Exit  Enables you to choose how ﬁles are sorted within directories, if at all  Displays a legend of the symbols DEFRAG uses to show disk usage  Displays information about the DEFRAG program  Exits DEFRAG  If you want to change the type of defragmentation that DEFRAG performs, choose Optimization Method. This option presents a dialog box in which you can specify whether DEFRAG defragments only ﬁles or completely defragments the disk. After you make a selec- tion, you can choose Begin Optimization from the Optimize menu; DEFRAG then performs the optimization you selected.  Normally, DOS doesn’t store ﬁlenames in a directory in any particular order. As you create and delete ﬁles, DOS removes old names and inserts new names wherever empty space occurs. The result is that when you use DIR to list the contents of a directory, often the ﬁles appear to be listed in random order. You can overcome this disorganized appearance by using the sorting switches available with the DIR command or by using some application programs, such as WordPerfect, which sort a directory each time they display it. This is not a permanent solution, however. The directory information is still stored on disk in a disor- ganized manner.  While DEFRAG reorganizes your disk, you can tell it to organize the names of the ﬁles within the directories in one of ﬁve ways:    Unsorted—This option, which is the default, tells DEFRAG to leave the names in their  current order.    Name—DEFRAG organizes the directory alphabetically by ﬁlename. This option is prob-  ably the one you will ﬁnd most useful.    Extension—DEFRAG organizes the directory by extension name; for example, all the COM  ﬁles appear together, all the EXE ﬁles appear together, and so on.  Part II Ch 7   180  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks    Date & Time—DEFRAG sorts the directory by the date and time the ﬁles were last mod-  iﬁed. This option enables you to tell at a glance which ﬁles have and have not been modiﬁed recently.    Size—DEFRAG organizes ﬁles by the amount of disk space they consume.  You also can specify that the sort be in ascending or descending order—that is, that values get larger or smaller as the directory listing proceeds. Usually, you want an ascending sort for names so that the list starts with the beginning of the alphabet and proceeds through the end of the alphabet. If you’re sorting by size, however, you might want a descending sort so that the biggest ﬁles are listed ﬁrst and the smallest ﬁles last.  You can specify how DEFRAG sorts directories from the DEFRAG Optimize menu by choosing File Sort. Figure 7.8 shows the File Sort menu. Alternatively, you can provide command- line arguments, discussed in the next section, to specify ﬁle sort type.  Figure 7.8 The DEFRAG File Sort menu.  When you use DEFRAG, you usually start it simply by typing DEFRAG. Like most DOS com- mands, however, DEFRAG has a number of startup options available. The complete syntax for DEFRAG is as follows: DEFRAG d:  F  U  S:order  B  SKIPHIGH  LCD  BW  G0  H  Normally, DEFRAG asks which drive you want to defragment. If you specify the d: parameter, DEFRAG uses it as the drive you want to defragment.  Typically, DEFRAG recommends the type of defragmentation you need to perform. The  F parameter tells DEFRAG to defragment the disk  leaving no empty spaces between ﬁles ; the  U parameter tells DEFRAG to defragment ﬁles  possibly leaving empty space between ﬁles . If you specify one of these parameters, DEFRAG does not make a recommendation, but it imme- diately carries out the type of defragmentation you specify.  You can control whether DEFRAG sorts directory entries by using the  S switch.  S is option- ally followed by a colon and one or more characters that specify how you want the entries sorted within each directory. Valid letters are listed in the following:  N  E  Alphabetical order by name Alphabetical order by extension   Getting the Most Space from Your Hard Disk  181  D  S  By date and time, with the oldest dates  that is, ﬁles that were last modiﬁed farthest in the past  listed ﬁrst By size, with the smallest ﬁles listed ﬁrst  The following command, for example, defragments drive C and sorts ﬁles in alphabetical order by name: DEFRAG C:  SN  You also can place a minus sign  –  after a sort letter to specify a descending sort instead of ascending. Consider these two commands: DEFRAG C:  SS  DEFRAG C:  SS-  The ﬁrst  without the minus sign  lists the smallest ﬁles ﬁrst; the second  with the minus sign  lists the largest ﬁles ﬁrst.  The  B switch tells DEFRAG to reboot your computer after the defragmentation process is complete.  The  SKIPHIGH switch tells DEFRAG to load itself into conventional memory. Otherwise, DEFRAG uses upper memory, if available.  The  LCD switch uses a color scheme that is likely to be more readable if you are using a lap- top or notebook computer with an LCD screen.  The  BW switch tells DEFRAG to use a black-and-white color scheme, which is likely to be more pleasing if you have a monochrome monitor.  The  G0 switch disables the mouse and graphics character set. Use this switch if DEFRAG dis- plays strange characters on your monitor.  Normally, DEFRAG does not reorganize hidden ﬁles. You can use the  H switch to tell DEFRAG to move hidden ﬁles.  When you use DEFRAG, keep in mind the following restrictions:    You cannot use DEFRAG to defragment drives over a network.    You cannot run DEFRAG from Windows.    Disk statistics reported by DEFRAG and CHKDSK or SCANDISK differ slightly. When listing the number of directories, for example, DEFRAG counts the root directory, but CHKDSK does not.  Getting the Most Space from Your Hard Disk  Since the introduction of PCs in 1981, the amount of disk storage space available to the average user has increased steadily. The original PCs used cassette tapes for mass storage  Part II Ch 7   182  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  and offered, as an option, ﬂoppy disks with only 160KB of storage space. Today, many  PCs are sold with hard disks that are thousands of times larger, usually 10GB and higher.  It is important to discuss other options, though, because many older PCs that are still  running are quite capable of running DOS, but they have only 100MB to 500MB hard drives. Upgrading these machines is not cost effective, so other ways to increase space are needed.  A decade ago, few software vendors wrote software that required several megabytes of disk storage because they knew that few of their potential customers’ systems had that kind of storage capability. Now vendors rarely think twice about releasing software that requires more than 40MB of disk storage; they expect that most people have that much space to spare. Some newer programs, especially games, can require up to 400MB of space to load completely.  Although you cannot increase the physical capacity of your disk without buying a larger disk, you might be able to increase the amount of data you can store on your disk by using the techniques discussed in the next couple of sections. First, you learn about manual methods of freeing disk space; then you learn about DoubleSpace, which provides full- time disk compression.  The two most popular methods of freeing disk space are to delete ﬁles you no longer need and to compress computer ﬁles. You also can archive ﬁles that you no longer need on ﬂoppy disks or tape backups.  Deleting Unnecessary Files  Much of the software available today is very complex, offering many features that you prob- ably will never use. As a result, many of the ﬁles copied to your hard disk when you install a software program are ﬁles that you never open. You might be able to ﬁnd and delete some of these ﬁles, thereby freeing some of your hard disk space.  Some programs, such as Microsoft Word for Windows, ask which features you expect to use and install only the ﬁles that are appropriate for you. If you later change your mind, you can install the missing pieces then.  Be sure to use the installation routine for programs such as Word to remove ﬁles. Never delete program ﬁles directly, unless you are sure there will be no adverse harm to the program.  When you install DOS, dozens of programs are installed on your hard disk. If you are short on disk space, you might want to browse through these programs and delete the ones that are not important to you. Consider the following examples:   Getting the Most Space from Your Hard Disk  183    DOS includes many ﬁles that enable it to work with foreign-language character sets,  including German, Swedish, and French. If you expect to use your computer only in the United States, you can delete these ﬁles to free disk space.    Some DOS utilities might duplicate functions that are available in other programs installed in your system. If you use a backup program  such as Norton Backup or FastBack , for example, you can delete the DOS backup program, MSBACKUP.  ➔ To determine which ﬁles supplied with DOS you can safely remove, see Appendix F, “Command  Reference,” p. 583. Another side effect of upgrading your version of DOS is that the old DOS ﬁles  from the previous version  are stored in a directory that begins with the letters OLD_DOS. After the upgrade is complete and you are sure that you want to continue using the new version of DOS, you can safely delete this directory and everything within it. The program DELOLDDOS, provided with DOS, can take care of this deletion for you.  Using File Compression  If you examine the ﬁle that contains the text for this chapter, you ﬁnd that many words— such as DOS and the—are repeated frequently. Most data includes such repetition—patterns that occur over and over within a ﬁle, whether the ﬁle contains text, customer data, or machine instructions.  Many programmers have written programs that analyze these patterns and squeeze a ﬁle’s data into a smaller space by converting the data into a kind of shorthand notation.  PKZip and LHArc are examples of such programs.  This process is known as compression. In special cases, the compressed data might require as little as 10% of the original space, although 50% is more typical.  If you are interested in acquiring a good compression program, check out an online down- load site, such as http:  www.downloads.com or http:  www.zdnet.com. File compression software is used extensively in telecommunications because the smaller ﬁles transfer faster and with less cost.  Archiving Files  Over time, you probably use your computer to perform many different tasks and complete a multitude of projects. When you complete a project, a good plan of action is to compress the ﬁles using compression software discussed in the preceding section.  You can move compressed ﬁles easily to high-density ﬂoppy disks or to a backup tape. You then can store these disks or tapes for long periods of time in case you need the information again.  Take a look at your hard drive and the dates of the data ﬁles contained on it. You might ﬁnd that you have many ﬁles that you have not accessed for a long time. Such ﬁles are prime candidates for archiving.  Part II Ch 7   184  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Projects  The following two projects will walk you through using the CHKDSK and SCANDISK utilities. These utilities are very important in analyzing hard drives and determining whether there might be a problem. CHKDSK can be used on uncompressed drives, whereas SCANDISK is required to check compressed drives.   Analyzing a Disk with CHKDSK  The external command CHKDSK analyzes a ﬂoppy or hard disk. CHKDSK checks a disk’s FAT, directories, and—if you want—the fragmentation of the ﬁles on the disk.  CHKDSK is DOS’s self-test command. It makes sure that the internal tables that keep ﬁles in control are in order.  Although the technical details of how CHKDSK performs its analysis are beyond the interest of most casual DOS users, the better you understand CHKDSK, the more comfortable you will be when the command uncovers problems. Just because you don’t understand exactly how CHKDSK works doesn’t mean that you must avoid using it.  CHKDSK checks for the following problems in the FAT:    Unlinked cluster chains  lost clusters    Multiply linked clusters  cross-linked ﬁles    Invalid next-cluster-in-chain values  invalid cluster numbers    Defective sectors where the FAT is stored  CHKDSK checks for the following problems in the directory system:    Invalid cluster numbers  out of range    Invalid ﬁle attributes in entries  attribute values that DOS does not recognize    Damage to subdirectory entries  CHKDSK cannot process them    Damage to a directory’s integrity  its ﬁles cannot be accessed   CHKDSK is meant to work with normal DOS volumes; it does not work with DoubleSpace disk volumes. If you want to analyze both DOS and DoubleSpace volumes, use the SCANDISK command, which is discussed later in this chapter.  Optionally, CHKDSK repairs problems in the FAT that are caused by lost clusters, and it writes the contents of the lost clusters to ﬁles. CHKDSK also can display all ﬁles and their paths.  Paths are discussed in Chapter 5, “Understanding Files and Directories.”    Projects  185  Running CHKDSK periodically on your hard disk and on important ﬂoppies is good prac- tice. Because the FAT and hierarchical directory system work together to track ﬁlenames and locations, a problem in the FAT or one of the directories is always serious. In all like- lihood, CHKDSK can ﬁnd and correct most problems in a disk’s internal bookkeeping tables.  The CHKDSK command uses the following syntax: CHKDSK filespec  F V  The optional filespec parameter is the drive, path, and ﬁlename of the ﬁle to be analyzed for fragmentation. If you don’t include a filespec, CHKDSK does not check for fragmentation.   F is the optional ﬁx switch, which instructs CHKDSK to repair any problems it encounters.   V is the verbose switch, which instructs CHKDSK to provide ﬁlenames onscreen as it analyzes the ﬁles.  When the process is complete, CHKDSK displays a screen report of its ﬁndings. This report summarizes disk and system memory usage. Figures 7.9 and 7.10 show typical CHKDSK reports.  Figure 7.9 A typical report pro- duced by CHKDSK with no parameters.

SCANDISK can reliably detect and fix a much wider range of disk problems.  For more information, type HELP SCANDISK from the command prompt.  Take advantage of the CHKDSK command’s capability to make a “dry run” of its check- ing routines. You can use this feature to assess reported problems. Before issuing CHKDSK with the  F switch, for example, issue the command without the switch. CHKDSK without  F prompts you if the command ﬁnds a problem  as though you had used the  F switch . After you have assessed the ﬁndings of CHKDSK and have taken remedial actions, you can issue CHKDSK with the  F switch so that the command can ﬁx the problems it ﬁnds.  DOS stores every ﬁle as a chain of clusters. Each cluster is a group of sectors; clusters are also referred to as allocation units. Each entry in the disk’s directory points to the entry in the FAT that contains the list of clusters allocated to a ﬁle.  Use CHKDSK  F only when you are running at the DOS prompt. You do not want to have other programs running because CHKDSK expects the DOS ﬁle system to be dor- mant while CHKDSK does its work. If you are shelled out to a DOS prompt from within an application or are running a DOS session under Windows, CHKDSK can damage your ﬁles.  CHKDSK processes each directory, starting at the root and following each subdirectory. It checks the cluster chain by using the directory entry’s FAT pointer and then compares the size of the ﬁle  in bytes  with the size of the FAT’s allocation  in clusters . CHKDSK expects to   Projects  187  ﬁnd enough chained clusters in the FAT to accommodate the ﬁle, but not more than are necessary. If CHKDSK ﬁnds too many clusters, it displays the following message: Allocation error, size adjusted  The ﬁle is truncated—excess clusters are deallocated—if you use the  F switch.  CHKDSK makes sure that each of the FAT’s clusters is allocated only once. In rare  circumstances—for example, if power problems or hardware failures occur—DOS can give the same cluster to two different ﬁles. By checking each cluster chain for cross-linked ﬁles, CHKDSK can report mixed-up ﬁles. Each time you see that the message ﬁlename is cross- linked on cluster nnnnn, copy the ﬁle reported in filename to another disk. When CHKDSK reports another ﬁle with the same message, copy the second ﬁle to another disk also. Chances are that the contents of the two ﬁles are mixed up, but you have a better chance of recovering the ﬁles if you save them to another disk before CHKDSK “ﬁxes” the problem.  CHKDSK expects every cluster in the FAT to be available for allocation, part of a legitimate directory-based cluster chain, or a marked bad cluster. If CHKDSK encounters any clusters or cluster chains that are not pointed to by a directory entry, CHKDSK issues the message lost clusters in XXX chains. CHKDSK then asks the following: Convert lost chains to files  Y N ?  This message appears even if you didn’t use the  F switch.  If you used the  F switch and you press Y, CHKDSK turns each cluster chain into a ﬁle in the root directory. Each ﬁle that is created has the name FILEnnnn.CHK.  nnnn is a number, start- ing with 0000, that increments by 1 for each ﬁle created by CHKDSK.  If you did not use the  F switch and you press Y, nothing happens. CHKDSK, however, does tell you what it would have done had you used the  F switch.  You can use the TYPE command to examine the contents of a text ﬁle, and you might be able to use the DOS EDIT command to put the text back into its original ﬁle. The TYPE or EDIT commands don’t do you any good, however, for a binary  program or data  ﬁle. If the problem is with a program ﬁle, you might have to use the DOS COMP or FC com- mand to compare your disk’s binary ﬁles with their counterparts from your master disks.  Of course, the disk does not physically lose any sectors. A lost cluster report does not indi- cate that the clusters are bad; lost clusters indicate only that DOS made a bookkeeping error in the FAT, which makes some clusters appear to DOS to be lost. The clusters are not tied to a directory entry, but they’re marked as being in use.  The lost cluster problem is most likely to occur when a program you are running crashes because of an error while ﬁles are being manipulated.  Part II Ch 7   188  Chapter 7 Preparing and Maintaining Disks  Remember that CHKDSK reports problems found during operation, but it does not repair the problems unless you include the  F switch in the command line. Running CHKDSK at least once a week is a good idea. Run CHKDSK daily during periods of extreme ﬁle activity.  Analyzing a Disk with the SCANDISK Utility  You might already know a bit about DoubleSpace, which was introduced with DOS 6.0. DoubleSpace enables you to virtually double the amount of information that can be stored on your disk. To accomplish this compression, however, information must be stored in a nonstandard manner. This means that CHKDSK cannot provide correct information about a disk volume that uses DoubleSpace.  Beginning with DOS 6.2, however, there is a solution: the SCANDISK command. This com- mand works with either regular or DoubleSpace disk volumes, and it provides greater func- tionality than did the older CHKDSK command. In fact, whenever you use CHKDSK, you see this message at the bottom of any display: Instead of using CHKDSK, try using SCANDISK.  SCANDISK can reliably detect and fix a much wider range of disk problems.  For more information, type HELP SCANDISK from the command prompt.  SCANDISK can detect and resolve all the problems that can be handled by CHKDSK. In addition, it can detect and correct the following problems:    MS-DOS boot sector errors   Defective clusters   Problems in a DoubleSpace volume header   Structure problems in the ﬁle structures of a DoubleSpace volume   Errors in the DoubleSpace compression structure   Errors in DoubleSpace volume signatures  The SCANDISK command has two possible syntaxes. If you want it to check a ﬁle or group of ﬁles, use the following syntax: SCANDISK  FRAGMENT filespec  If you want SCANDISK to analyze an entire drive, use the following syntax: SCANDISK switches d:  In this syntax, d: is the drive you want to check; if you do not supply a drive, SCANDISK assumes that you want to check the current drive. Many more switches can be used with SCANDISK than with CHKDSK. These switches are detailed in Table 7.5.   Projects  189  Table 7.5 Possible Switches for Use with SCANDISK  Switch   ALL  Meaning Checks all local drives.   AUTOFIX  Fixes any problems that are encountered without asking ﬁrst.   CHECKONLY  Analyzes the disk but does not ﬁx any problems.   CUSTOM   FRAGMENT   MONO   NOSAVE  Uses the SCANDISK settings contained in the ﬁle SCANDISK.INI.  Checks a ﬁle for fragmentation. You must specify the full ﬁlename after the switch.  Forces display settings for a monochrome monitor.  Doesn’t save lost cluster chains into ﬁles; simply frees them  used only with   AUTOFIX .   NOSUMMARY  Indicates that SCANDISK should not stop at summary screens  used only with  AUTOFIX or  CHECKONLY .   SURFACE  Performs a surface scan.   UNDO  Undoes previous repairs. You must have an undo disk, and you must specify the drive on the command line.  Use SCANDISK only at the DOS prompt. SCANDISK does not work properly if you are operating under a multitasking shell such as DESQview, Windows, or the DOS Shell. Exit these programs before you attempt to use SCANDISK.  You might have already noted, from the information in Table 7.5, that you can store your SCANDISK parameters in the ﬁle SCANDISK.INI. This ﬁle, which is stored in the DOS directory, speciﬁes how you want SCANDISK to operate. For more information on this ﬁle, use a text editor to load the ﬁle. It contains extensive comments on how you can modify the ﬁle to change the behavior of SCANDISK.  As an example of how SCANDISK operates, enter SCANDISK at the DOS prompt. You see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 7.11.  Each of the ﬁve listed areas is in turn analyzed by SCANDISK. The ﬁrst four areas are processed very quickly. The ﬁnal area takes more time; therefore, you are prompted before SCANDISK actually performs a surface test. On a 340MB hard drive, for example, a surface scan can take up to 35 minutes to complete. This amount of time is necessary because every sector on the disk is read and analyzed to make sure that it is correct.

Most programs generate ﬁles as you work with them. You begin to accumulate ﬁles on your computer’s disks in much the same way that you accumulate possessions in your home or ofﬁce. Fortunately, DOS provides useful ﬁle-management commands that help you keep ﬁle clutter to a minimum. This chapter covers ﬁle-management techniques.  One of the most difﬁcult things to do in this age of multiple-gigabyte hard drives is to keep track of all the information stored on your hard drive. By creating a directory structure that segregates groups of ﬁles according to their uses, you can keep the ﬁles on your computer’s hard disk organized and cataloged. The adage “a place for everything and everything in its place” is never more true than when you’re storing ﬁles on a large hard disk.  It is important that you understand the distinction between utility programs and applica- tions when devising a strategy to manage ﬁles using DOS. A utility is generally regarded as a single-purpose program that performs one speciﬁc task and then gets out of your way. An application generally provides a working environment capable of providing all the services required to perform general tasks such as word processing and creating pictures.  DOS’s external commands are perfect examples of utilities. Each external command serves a speciﬁc purpose, such as sorting lists or formatting disks. You usually run a utility program by typing a command line at the DOS prompt. It does its work and then terminates, giving you another DOS prompt to work from. Utilities usually have all their programming con- tained in a single EXE or COM ﬁle, and they seldom use auxiliary ﬁles. It therefore is most often convenient to place utility programs into directories that are part of the search path so that they are available no matter what directory you are logged in to. By default, most utili- ties act on ﬁles in the currently logged directory.  Applications, even though they might be dedicated to a single activity such as word process- ing or database management, have a much broader scope. Unlike utilities, which do their job and terminate to a DOS prompt, applications create a working environment in which users can access the features of the applications. Only when you exit an application do you receive another DOS prompt.  Applications usually are installed into a directory of their own. They often use auxiliary ﬁles such as overlays—a special type of ﬁle that contains the programming code necessary  to provide a subset of the application’s features. These auxiliary ﬁles often make it neces- sary or convenient to log in to an application’s home directory before running the applica- tion. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule because some utilities also create ﬁles. The most notable feature of an application, in the context of this discussion, is that it most often  creates ﬁles having a speciﬁc format unique to the application. WordPerfect creates WordPerfect ﬁles, Lotus 1-2-3 creates 1-2-3 ﬁles, and so on.  In terms of working with ﬁles, the distinction between utilities and applications is simple. Utilities most often work with ﬁles in place—that is, in the location  directory  where they   were created. Applications, on the other hand, usually work with ﬁles in speciﬁc directories created to store ﬁles that have the native format particular to that application.  Listing Files with the DIR Command  193  When you’re creating directory structures on your hard disk, it is usually a good idea to cre- ate dedicated directories for your applications where those applications can store the ﬁles you create. Doing so enables you to ﬁnd a particular ﬁle more easily when you need it.  Part II Ch 8  Listing Files with the DIR Command  The DIR command is one of the ﬁrst commands most DOS users learn. It also is the most- used command in the DOS inventory. The command quickly gives you a list of your ﬁles, along with the date and time you created them, and the ﬁle sizes. If you type only DIR, you are using only a fraction of the command’s full power. The following sections help you unlock the power of the DIR command.  By default, many applications create ﬁles in their home directories when installed. Many of these applications have dozens of auxiliary ﬁles  overlays, printer drivers, video drivers, and so on . For this reason, it is a good idea to create one or more directories—branching off an application’s home directory—where ﬁles created by the application are stored.  Many applications have settings that can specify which directory newly created ﬁles should be written in. Check the documentation for your applications to ﬁnd out how to set up default directories for newly created ﬁles.  Issuing the DIR Command  DIR is an internal command. All the programming for this command is contained in  COMMAND.COM, so you will never ﬁnd DIR.EXE in your DOS directory. The syntax of the DIR command is as follows: DIR FileNameExp  P  W  A:attributes  O:order  S  B  L  FileNameExp is a ﬁlename expression that can contain the drive, path, and ﬁle speciﬁcation. Of course, the ﬁlename expression can include wildcards.  The DIR command also uses several switches. These switches and their deﬁnitions are shown in Table 8.1.   194  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Table 8.1  DIR Switches  Action Displays one screen of information and then pauses. Pressing any key causes DIR to continue the listing.  Displays only the ﬁlenames, without the size, date, or modiﬁcation time of the ﬁles. Files are listed in columns across the screen rather than one ﬁlename per line.   A:attributes  Displays only ﬁles that have, or lack, ﬁle attributes you specify, such as read- only, hidden, or system ﬁles.   O:order  Lists ﬁles in a different sorted order, such as alphabetical order by name.  Lists the contents of subdirectories.  Lists ﬁlenames only, one per line.  Lists all ﬁlenames in lowercase.  Displays the ﬁle compression ratio.  Switch   P   W   S   B   L   C   CH  Displays the ﬁle compression ratio using the host allocation unit size.  When you issue the DIR command with parameters missing, DOS uses default values. If you omit the ﬁlename expression, DIR uses the currently logged directory. Unless you use the  O switch, ﬁles and directories are listed in their regular, unsorted order.  Understanding the Operation of the DIR Command  When you issue the DIR command, the volume label and serial number of the disk are dis- played along with a ﬁlename expression that speciﬁes what directory is being displayed. Files and subdirectories are then displayed in the following format unless you specify the  W switch: CIS      ZIP     55,029 08-01-01  11:47p DISCPASS            06-16-01   3:10a  The ﬁrst line of the example shows the standard format for ﬁles. Directory information is divided into ﬁve columns. From left to right, they are as follows:    Filename   Extension   Size of the ﬁle in bytes   The last date the ﬁle was edited   The time of day the ﬁle was last edited  The second line of the example shows how directories are displayed. The   symbol indicates that the entry is a directory and thus doesn’t have a byte count.  The information displayed by DIR includes most of the data stored in the directory table. The ﬁle attributes do not appear, but DOS uses them to determine whether to display a ﬁle. By default, hidden ﬁles are not included in this list. The location of the ﬁrst cluster in the   Listing Files with the DIR Command  195  ﬁle allocation table  FAT  for the ﬁle also is not displayed because knowing the ﬁle’s starting cluster is of little use to you as a user.  At the end of the listing, DOS indicates the total number of ﬁles in the directory, the total number of bytes used by the listed ﬁles, and the total number of bytes free on the current disk. The DIR report for C:\DOS, for example, might show the following information: 157 file s     6,455,328 bytes  119,504,896 bytes free  Part II Ch 8  If you add the size of each of the listed ﬁles on the disk and subtract the result from the total disk capacity, that number and the number of free bytes shown in the directory listing prob- ably do not match, but the directory listing is correct. Remember that hidden ﬁles are not shown; more importantly, the size of the ﬁle is not necessarily the same as the amount of disk space it occupies.  You might remember from earlier chapters that a cluster is the smallest possible chunk of disk space that can be allocated. When you create a ﬁle, no matter how small, DOS allocates at least one cluster to store the ﬁle. The directory listing shows the length of the data stored in bytes and calculates the free space, based on the number of free clusters on the disk. These free clusters are the remaining positions on the disk, not yet allocated to another ﬁle.  The free space reported by DIR is the number of unallocated clusters  also called allocation units  multiplied by the size of a cluster  1,024 bytes on most hard disks . You also can use CHKDSK to get a report of the total number of allocation units available on the disk.  Displaying a Screen of Information with the DIR Command  If you add the  P switch to the DIR command, DOS pauses the scrolling of the screen at the end of each screen of information. Pressing any key displays the next page of information.  To see more ﬁlenames, use the  W switch. When you use this switch, a directory listing like the one shown in Figure 8.1 appears.  With hierarchical directories, your directory listing includes subdirectory names and ﬁles. In the wide listing, directory names are enclosed in brackets  [] . Because the ﬁlenames are grouped so closely together, a wide listing can be useful when you want to see the types of ﬁles in a directory.  Using the Attributes Switch   A  When you specify the  A switch, only those ﬁles having the attributes you include on the command line are listed in the DIR display. The  A switch uses one or more of the following codes for the attributes parameter:  D  R  H  A  S  Directory attribute Read-only attribute Hidden attribute Archive attribute System attribute   196  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Figure 8.1 Using the  W switch to see ﬁlenames pre- sented in wide  format.

To see only a listing of all hidden ﬁles in the current directory, enter the following command and press Enter: DIR  AH  You can use attribute codes in any combination and in any order. You can list all ﬁlenames with the read-only and archive attributes, for example, by issuing the following command: DIR  ARA  DOS lists only ﬁlenames that have both attributes.  To list only ﬁlenames that do not have a certain attribute, insert a minus sign  –  before the attribute code. To see all ﬁles that are not directories and that don’t have the archive bit, for example, type the following command at the command line and press Enter: DIR  A-A-D   Listing Files with the DIR Command  197  Using the Order Switch   O  As mentioned earlier, the  O switch enables you to choose the order in which DOS lists ﬁle- names. When you want DOS to sort the ﬁle list in a particular order, use the  O switch with the following sort codes:  Part II Ch 8  C  D  E  G  N  S  Sorts ﬁles by compression ratio Sorts ﬁles chronologically by date and time Sorts ﬁles alphabetically by ﬁle extension Groups directories ﬁrst before showing ﬁles Sorts ﬁles alphabetically by name Sorts ﬁles numerically by ﬁle size  You can include sort codes in any combination. The order of the sort codes determines the ﬁnal sorted order.  ONE, for example, sorts the ﬁlenames ﬁrst by name and then by extension. The command DIR  OEN sorts ﬁles by extension  for example, grouping all .COM ﬁles together and all .EXE ﬁles together  and then sorts the ﬁles by name. If you include the  O switch in a DIR command without specifying a sort code, DOS sorts the ﬁles alphabetically by name.  DOS assumes that all sorting is to be done in ascending order—A through Z, smallest to largest, earliest to latest. DOS uses these criteria  the default setting  unless you precede your sort codes with a minus sign  –  to force the sort into reverse order—Z through A, largest to smallest, latest to earliest.  Using the  B and  L Switches You can use the  B switch to display a “bare” ﬁle list—a list of ﬁlenames without information about ﬁle size and the date and time the ﬁle was last changed. The following is an example: DIR A:  B  DOS lists all ﬁlenames of the ﬁles in the current directory of the ﬂoppy disk in drive A. For this example, DOS does not list ﬁle size or ﬁle date and time.   Another way to view directory listings, especially for extremely long listings, is to pipe the information to a text ﬁle for later viewing or printing. To do so, you use the > symbol after the DIR command and then specify a ﬁlename as follows: DIR > dirlist.txt  This technique is especially helpful if you want to use the information in another pro- gram, such as Word, because you can cut and paste from the text ﬁle.  If you want to capture the ﬁle list to a ﬁle, issue a command similar to this: DIR A:  B >FILES.TXT  You can use the  L switch with the DIR command if you want the ﬁlenames to appear in lowercase letters.   198  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Searching for Files with the DIR Command  No matter how carefully you construct your directory structures, occasionally you lose a ﬁle. Most of the time you simply forget where you put a particular ﬁle. Sometimes, however, you lose the ﬁle because you have mistyped a ﬁlename expression. When you look in the direc- tory in which you think a ﬁle should reside, it is missing. Other times, you simply forget the exact name of the ﬁle you’re looking for.  The DIR command is an effective tool for ﬁnding “lost” ﬁles when you use the  S switch. Entering the following command causes DOS to display every ﬁle written to drive C: DIR C:\  S  You can, of course, use ﬁlename expressions and other DIR switches to narrow the scope of the search. The following example lists all the .DOC ﬁles in WordPerfect’s directory as well as all the directories that branch off the WP directory: DIR C:\WP\*.DOC  S  Assume for the moment that you have created budget spreadsheets using your spreadsheet software and that you have saved these spreadsheets on your hard disk. You want to make a copy of the budget spreadsheet ﬁles, but you cannot remember the directory in which they are located. However, you do remember that all the ﬁlenames start with the letters BUDG. You can use the DIR command to search the hard disk for the location of the ﬁles. To do so, change to the root directory of your hard disk and then type the following command: DIR BUDG*.*  S  When you press Enter, DOS displays a listing similar to this: Volume in drive C is DCI 3 Volume Serial Number is 1B2B-392C  Directory of C:\SPREADSH\QPRO4DAT  BUDGET   WQ1       4,037 10-05-01   2:00a  1 files s        4,037 bytes  Directory of C:\WORD_PRO\ENDATA  BUDGET   WK1       5,120 04-07-01   8:51p  1 files s        5,120 bytes  Total files listed:  2 files s        9,157 bytes  119,504,896 bytes free  As you have seen, you can use the DIR command to locate ﬁles if you know something about their ﬁlenames. But what do you use if you know only that the ﬁle contains the text “Meet me in St. Louis, Louie,” and that the string is to be found in one of three ﬁles? In this case, you use the FIND command. Because FIND is useful in various situations, it is covered in detail in Chapter 13, “Controlling Devices.”   Viewing Files  199  Part II Ch 8  Customizing the DIR Command  If you ﬁnd that you continually use one or more of the several switches with the DIR com- mand, you can avoid typing them repeatedly by creating an environment variable named DIRCMD using the following command: SET DIRCMD=switches  For the switches parameter, substitute the switch or switches you want DOS to use automat- ically. If, for example, you want DOS to sort ﬁlenames alphabetically and pause scrolling after each screenful of information, include the following command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle: SET DIRCMD= ON P  Then, reboot the computer. DOS creates the environment variable DIRCMD and gives it the value  ON P. Each time you issue the DIR command, DOS adds these two switches automati- cally.  You can override a switch that is recorded in DIRCMD by preceding the switch with a minus sign  – . To override the  P switch currently recorded in DIRCMD, for example, so that DOS lists all ﬁlenames without pausing at the end of each screen of information, issue the DIR command shown here: DIR  -P  Viewing Files  After you ﬁnd a ﬁle, you often need to peek into it to ﬁnd out what it contains. Knowing what a ﬁle contains is crucial to knowing how to best work with the ﬁle. DOS provides tools to enable you to look into ﬁles.  Previously, you learned that DOS stores ﬁles on disks in binary format—using zeros and ones. You learned that these binary digits, grouped in bundles of eight, form bytes. You also read that each byte can form one of 256 values called the ASCII code, which represents let- ters, numbers, computer commands, and so on. That description is ﬁne as far as it goes, but it is a simplistic view that doesn’t present the whole picture.  ➔ For more information on how DOS stores data, see Chapter 6, “Understanding Disks and Disk Drives,”  p. 127. A computer uses bits and bytes in many ways. The microprocessor in your computer is designed to use binary digits in groups of eight, true. But those binary digits can be used in different contexts. Each bit in a byte might be used to indicate the status of a condition, with 1 meaning on and 0 meaning off. Large numeric values, such as a spreadsheet might use, might be stored in two or four bytes, which are translated into decimal numbers that users understand. Bytes also are used to deliver instructions  program code  to your com- puter’s microprocessor.  Understanding these contexts isn’t at all important for you to be able to work with your computer, but knowing that these contexts exist makes it much easier to work with ﬁles. When you need to view the contents of ﬁles, having this knowledge is essential.   200  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Understanding Types of Files  From a user’s point of view, ﬁles fall into two categories: binary and ASCII. Binary ﬁles are not understandable by humans. When you try to look into them, they appear to be gibber- ish. Strings of smiley faces, hearts, and a slew of weird-looking symbols are interspersed with letters and numbers to produce an unintelligible display. When you see this kind of dis- play, you know you have opened a binary ﬁle.  ASCII ﬁles use bytes to represent the symbols you use to communicate every day: letters, numerals, punctuation marks, and so on. An ASCII ﬁle is the simplest ﬁle format used by DOS. When DOS displays or prints an ASCII ﬁle, the groupings of binary digits are directly translated into a human-readable format. ASCII ﬁles also are referred to as DOS text ﬁles, or simply text ﬁles.  Unless you are programming, binary ﬁles are of little interest to you. DOS does provide the DEBUG command to view and edit binary ﬁles, but you had better know what you are doing. The DEBUG command is documented in Appendix F, “Command Reference,” for the sake of completeness, but its use is far beyond the scope of this book. It is enough for you to know that if you open a binary ﬁle, you can look all you want, but under no circumstances do you want to change anything or do a disk save on the ﬁle, even by accident. Changing even one byte in an executable ﬁle can render a program useless and can even be dangerous to your data.  ➔ DOS provides two commands for viewing the contents of ASCII ﬁles: EDIT and TYPE. The EDIT com-  mand enables you to view and edit ﬁles. For complete information on EDIT, see Chapter 15, “Using the DOS Editor,” p. 361.  Using the TYPE Command to View Files  When you need to see the contents of an ASCII text ﬁle, you can use the TYPE command. By redirecting the output of TYPE, you can print a hard copy of the ﬁle.  The syntax for the TYPE command is as follows: TYPE filename.ext  Replace filename.ext with the name of the ﬁle you want DOS to display.  Remember to include a disk drive and pathname, if necessary.  A ﬁlename is not optional. Wildcard char- acters are not permitted because TYPE can display the contents of only one ﬁle at a time.  TYPE is designed to display the contents of a text ﬁle that contains ASCII characters. When you issue a TYPE command, DOS opens the speciﬁed ﬁle and sends the ﬁle’s contents to the screen as ASCII characters. When DOS encounters a Ctrl+Z character  ASCII decimal 26; the end-of-ﬁle character , it stops displaying the contents of the ﬁle and returns to the com- mand prompt.  When you use TYPE to view a text ﬁle, the ﬁle’s contents can ﬁll and begin to scroll off the screen faster than you can read the text. You can press Ctrl+S or the Pause key  available only on the Enhanced Keyboard  to stop scrolling, but the text you want to see might   Viewing Files  201  already have scrolled off the screen. The MORE ﬁlter displays a screenful of a command’s  output and then pauses until you press a key. You can use MORE with the TYPE command as follows: TYPE AUTOEXEC.BAT  MORE  The  character in this command is the DOS pipe character, which instructs DOS to send a command’s output to the ﬁlter that follows the pipe character. Piping to MORE causes DOS to pause the scrolling of the screen when the screen ﬁlls. You can press any key to display the next screenful.  ➔ For detailed information on DOS redirection and MORE, see Chapter 13, “Controlling Devices,” p. 317.  Part II Ch 8  An even easier way to display an ASCII ﬁle one screen at a time is to redirect a ﬁle into the MORE command without using the TYPE command. To do so, use the following  syntax: MORE < d:path\filename.ext  The < symbol causes DOS to use the speciﬁed ﬁle parameter as input to the MORE ﬁlter. DOS displays the ﬁle, one page at a time, displaying the message -More- at the end of each page. To display a ﬁle in the C:\DOS directory, for example, type the following command  replacing filename.ext with the ﬁlename and extension of the ﬁle you want to view , and press Enter: MORE < C:\DOS\filename.ext  If you want a simple printed copy of the contents of a text ﬁle, you can redirect the output of the TYPE command to the printer by using the special redirection character, the greater- than sign  > . To print the contents of the README.TXT ﬁle, for example, make sure that your printer is online and then issue the following command: TYPE README.TXT >PRN  Your printer prints the ﬁle.  Because TYPE does not format the text into pages, the printed output might not break at page boundaries.   When you use the TYPE command, remember the following guidelines:    The output of TYPE stops when the command encounters the ﬁrst Ctrl+Z in the ﬁle.   Because TYPE does not accept wildcards in the ﬁlename parameter, use of the command  is limited to one ﬁle at a time.    TYPE tries to interpret any ﬁle as an ASCII text ﬁle, even if the ﬁle contains non-ASCII  data. If you use a binary ﬁle  such as a COM or EXE ﬁle  as the ﬁle parameter, the TYPE command’s output might produce graphical characters, control-character sequences, and beeps. Its output might even lock up your computer, forcing you to reboot.    You can pause the TYPE command’s output by pressing Ctrl+S or Pause. Press any key  to resume scrolling.    You can terminate the TYPE command’s output by pressing Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break.   202  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Copying Files  Probably the most common ﬁle-related function is copying ﬁles from one disk or directory to another, a fundamental job for disk operating systems. MS-DOS provides the internal COPY command for use at the command line. Copying ﬁles via the DOS Shell is covered in Chapter 4, “Using the DOS Shell.”  The DOS COPY command enables you to copy ﬁles as well as data to and from logical devices. Figure 8.2 diagrams the copy operation used with several possible inputs and two possible outputs. Three of the possible inputs consist of more than one ﬁle or logical device. DOS can join two or more inputs into one output in a process called combining. You might never need to use all these inputs and outputs, but they’re available.  Figure 8.2 Possible inputs and outputs in a copy operation.  Using the COPY Command  You can create a COPY command line in various ways. All the variations say the same thing to DOS: “COPY THIS THERE.” The THIS represents the source—the ﬁles to be copied. The THERE represents the target—the disk location or device you want the ﬁles to be copied to.  When you perform a copy operation, remember the following guidelines:    The source parameter must contain at least one of the following parameters: path, ﬁle,  or device.  the ﬁles.    If the ﬁle speciﬁcation portion of a ﬁlename expression is omitted, all ﬁles in the speci- ﬁed directory and drive are copied. This situation is equivalent to supplying *.* as the source-ﬁle parameter.    You can specify additional source-ﬁle parameters by using the + operator to combine    If the source-ﬁle parameter contains a wildcard and the destination parameter is a ﬁle- name, the destination ﬁle is the combination of source ﬁles that match the source-ﬁle parameter.    If COPY detects an attempt to copy a single source ﬁle to itself  same drive, directory,  ﬁlename, and extension , the copy operation is aborted.    The optional destination parameter consists of a combination of drive, path, and ﬁle- name parameters. If you don’t provide a drive or path, DOS uses the current drive or path for the destination. If you don’t specify a destination ﬁlename, DOS uses the source ﬁle’s name as the destination parameter.   Copying Files  203    COPY is deﬁnitely a versatile ﬁle-management workhorse, but you do have to be careful.  An incorrect COPY operation can do nearly as much damage as an incorrect DEL com- mand because the destination ﬁle’s entries in the FAT and in the directory are not saved as they were, making ﬁle recovery all but impossible. Be sure to treat COPY with respect. Many programs include warning messages as part of their internal ﬁle copying com- mands. The COPY command gives no warning when it is about to overwrite existing ﬁles. In a COPY command, the order of the parameter requirements always moves from the source to the destination, or target. The full syntax for the COPY command is as follows: COPY SourceExpression TargetExpression  V  A  B  Y  Part II Ch 8  The SourceExpression and TargetExpression parameters specify either a ﬁlename expres- sion that speciﬁes one or more ﬁles or a DOS device, as in the following example: COPY STUFF.TXT PRN  In this example, the ﬁle STUFF.TXT  an ASCII text ﬁle  is copied to the printer to produce a hard copy of the ﬁle’s contents. Use COPY to print ASCII ﬁles only because ﬁles containing word processor codes, graphics, or ﬁle headers don’t result in clean reproductions of the ﬁle’s content.  For combining ﬁles, the source expression can be two or more ﬁlename expressions that specify a single ﬁle, joined with the + symbol, as in this example: COPY MEMO1.TXT + B:\MEMOS\MEMO2.TXT  H:\MYMEMO.TXT  In this example, the ﬁle MEMO1.TXT, located in the currently logged directory, will be com- bined with a ﬁle located in the MEMOS directory of drive B to create a ﬁle having the name MYMEMO.TXT on drive H.  As you can see, you can use four switches with the COPY command:  V,  A,  B, and  Y. The  A and  B switches can be applied to individual ﬁlename expressions in both the source and tar- get expressions. The following list details the uses of the COPY switches:    The  V switch veriﬁes that the copy has been recorded correctly.   When  A is used in SourceExpression, ﬁles are treated as ASCII; that is, COPY copies all the information in the ﬁle up to, but not including, the ﬁrst end-of-ﬁle marker  ASCII decimal 26 . DOS ignores anything after the end-of-ﬁle marker.    When  A is used in TargetExpression, an end-of-ﬁle marker is added to the end of the  ASCII ﬁle after it is copied.    When  B is used in SourceExpression, COPY copies the entire ﬁle  based on its size, as  listed in the directory  as though the copied ﬁle were a program ﬁle  binary . Any end- of-ﬁle markers are copied.    When  B is used in TargetExpression, it does not add the end-of-ﬁle marker to the end  of the copied data.    The  Y switch indicates whether you want COPY to overwrite ﬁles with the same name  without prompting. You can use the  -Y switch to indicate that you want to be prompted.   204  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Copying Groups of Files Suppose that you have 20 ﬁles you want to copy to a ﬂoppy disk or to another directory on your hard disk. You can use wildcards in the ﬁlename expression to specify a subset of the ﬁles in a directory, as in this example: COPY C:\ROCCANTI\*.TXT B:  This example ﬁnds all the .TXT ﬁles in the ROCCANTI directory and copies them onto the ﬂoppy disk in drive B. You do, of course, have to make sure that the disk in drive B has enough room to receive the ﬁles. Use the DIR command to ﬁnd out how many bytes the ﬁles to be copied require and to make sure that at least that much space is available on drive B.  If you want to copy all the ﬁles in a directory to another disk or another directory, use a command similar to this: COPY E:\CLIPPER5\INVNTRY\*.* H:\TEST  In this example, the *.* wildcard expression speciﬁes that all ﬁles in the INVNTRY directory are to be copied to the TEST directory on drive H.  Some older keyboards do not have a conveniently placed key for the asterisk. You might want to use the . wildcard to specify all ﬁles in the directory, as in this line: COPY E:\CLIPPER5\INVNTRY\. H:\TEST  This command is functionally equivalent to the preceding example using the *.  Combining Text Files Although you can use COPY to combine any ﬁles, the combine operation is most effective when the ﬁles are ASCII text ﬁles. In most cases, combining binary ﬁles results in an unus- able destination ﬁle.  For the following examples, assume that the current directory contains three text ﬁles, all with .TXT extensions. The ﬁles and their contents are listed here:  File  INTRO.TXT  BODY.TXT  ENDING.TXT  Contents Combining is the joining of ﬁles into a new ﬁle.  To join the three ﬁles into a fourth ﬁle, type the following command: COPY INTRO.TXT+BODY.TXT+ENDING.TXT ALL.TXT  The resulting ﬁle, ALL.TXT, contains the text from the three source ﬁles. To verify ALL.TXT, issue the following command: TYPE ALL.TXT   TYPE sends the contents of ALL.TXT to the screen. DOS displays the following output: Combining is the joining of files into a new file.  If you omit the target expression, or specify only drive and path information in the ﬁle- name expression, the ﬁle created by combining ﬁles has the same name as the ﬁrst ﬁle- name speciﬁed in the source expression.  Copying Files  205  Part II Ch 8  Renaming Files with COPY As you might guess from the examples in the preceding section, you can change the name of a ﬁle or group of ﬁles by using COPY. Consider this example: COPY *.TXT *.ASC  This example copies all the ﬁles in the current directory having the extension TXT. Each TXT ﬁle is copied to an ASC ﬁle. The ASC ﬁles have the same names as the original TXT ﬁles. The contents are the same and the names are the same—only the extensions are altered.  Copying from a Device to a File A common and handy use of the COPY command is copying to a ﬁle keystrokes entered from the keyboard or console device.  CON is the device name for console, a device constructed using your keyboard and monitor.  You can use the resulting text ﬁle as a batch ﬁle, a con- ﬁguration ﬁle, a memo, and so on.  To practice copying from the keyboard to a ﬁle, you can create a simple batch ﬁle that changes the current directory to \123R3 and starts Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3. The command that creates the batch ﬁle is shown here: COPY CON C:\DOS\RUN123.BAT  When you press Enter, DOS displays the cursor on the next line, but the DOS prompt does not appear. You can type the ﬁle by following these steps:  1. Type C: and press Enter. The cursor drops to the next line. 2. Type CD\123R3 and press Enter. The cursor drops to the next line. 3. Type LOTUS and press Enter. The cursor drops to the next line. 4. Press the F6 function key or Ctrl+Z to indicate the end of the ﬁle. DOS displays the  end-of-ﬁle marker  ^Z .  5. Press Enter. The ^Z code indicates to DOS that you are ﬁnished entering data into the  ﬁle. DOS responds with the message 1 file s  copied.  To conﬁrm that the new ﬁle appears the way you want it, you can use the TYPE command to review its contents.   206  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Using the XCOPY Command  If you try this example on your system, be sure to use the appropriate directory names for DOS and Lotus 1-2-3.  Knowing how to use COPY CON can be both a lifesaver and a pain in the neck. It can be a life- saver because COPY CON enables you to create a text ﬁle on any DOS system. It also can be a pain in the neck because after you have pressed Enter to go to the next line, you cannot go back and edit previous lines. If you make a mistake, you must start over again.  If the DOS EDIT command—found only in version 5.0 and later—is available, or if some other ASCII editor is available, use it. You are much better off using the editor instead of the COPY command because you can more easily correct any typos you ﬁnd.  The external command XCOPY is an enhanced version of COPY that, among other capabilities, can copy whole directories and their subdirectories while creating directories on the destina- tion disk.  Using XCOPY, you can exercise much more control over the ﬁles to be copied. You can copy only those ﬁles with the archive attribute set, for example, or only those ﬁles with a date stamp on or after a speciﬁed date.  The syntax of XCOPY is similar to that of COPY, but the switches are more complex. The XCOPY syntax is as follows: XCOPY SourceExpression TargetExpression  V  P  W  S  E  A  M  Y  D:date  Just like the COPY command, XCOPY takes ﬁlename expressions to specify the source ﬁles and the target ﬁles for the operation. Unlike COPY, XCOPY has several switches that enable you to ﬁnely control how the copy is performed. Following is a rundown of the available switches:     V veriﬁes the accuracy of the copy operation by comparing each ﬁle as it is written to  the original ﬁle.     P displays a prompt to conﬁrm whether you want to create each destination ﬁle. Using  P, you can specify a group of ﬁles with a wildcard and then decide which ﬁles you actu- ally want to copy. If, for example, you want to copy several ﬁles in a directory but don’t want to enter ﬁve separate COPY commands, you can use the following: XCOPY *.TXT B:  P As each ﬁle is about to be copied, XCOPY prompts you to see whether that ﬁle is to be copied. Answer Y and the ﬁle is copied; answer N and it is skipped.     W causes XCOPY to pause before copying any ﬁles, displaying the prompt Press any key  to begin copying file s . You can pause to change disks.     S causes XCOPY to copy the ﬁles located in any directories that branch off from the  source directory. Empty directories are ignored.    E causes XCOPY to copy even empty directories.   Copying Files  207     A causes XCOPY to copy only ﬁles with the archive attribute set without modifying the  ﬁle’s attributes.     M causes XCOPY to remove the archive bit from any ﬁles copied.   The  Y switch indicates whether you want XCOPY to overwrite ﬁles with the same name  without prompting. You also can use the  -Y switch to indicate that you want to be prompted.     D enables you to specify a date parameter. XCOPY copies only ﬁles with a date attribute on or after the speciﬁed date. Which date format you use depends on the country set- ting you use.  Part II Ch 8  In an XCOPY operation, DOS might not always recognize whether a particular parameter refers to a ﬁle or to a directory. When ambiguity arises, XCOPY asks whether the destination is a ﬁlename or pathname.  All ﬁles created by XCOPY have the archive attribute set automatically, even if the origi- nal source ﬁle does not have the archive attribute.  If no directory named WORDS exists on the destination disk, DOS cannot determine whether you intend to create a ﬁle or a directory named WORDS on the A disk.  Consider the following command: XCOPY C:\WORDS\*.* A:\WORDS  XCOPY displays the following message: Does WORDS specify a file name or directory name on the target  F = file, D = directory ?  Press F when the destination  target  is a ﬁlename or D when the destination is a directory. Unlike COPY, XCOPY creates directories on the destination disk as needed.  If you append a backslash to the name of the target directory, XCOPY automatically assumes that the target is a directory, not a ﬁle. Continuing the preceding example, if you use the following command instead, you do not have to specify that the target is a directory: XCOPY C:\WORDS\*.* A:\WORDS\  XCOPY creates the \WORDS directory if it does not exist.  Understanding the Operation of XCOPY XCOPY is best described as a hybrid between COPY and BACKUP RESTORE. XCOPY and COPY dupli- cate ﬁles between directories and disks. Unlike COPY, however, XCOPY does not copy ﬁles to  a nondisk device, such as the printer  PRN  or console  CON . Like BACKUP and RESTORE, XCOPY can copy ﬁles selectively and traverse the directory tree to copy ﬁles from more than   208  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  one directory. XCOPY also can make a destination directory when one does not exist. This directory capability makes XCOPY useful for duplicating a directory branch onto another disk.  Like COPY but unlike BACKUP, XCOPY copies ﬁles that are directly usable.  You cannot use ﬁles processed by BACKUP until you have processed them with RESTORE.   When using the XCOPY command, consider the following guidelines:    XCOPY cannot copy hidden source ﬁles.   XCOPY does not overwrite read-only destination ﬁles.   If a ﬁle parameter is omitted in the XCOPY syntax, XCOPY assumes the *.* full wildcard  pattern as the default ﬁle parameter.    If you include the  D switch, you must enter the date parameter in the format of the system’s DATE command or in the format indicated by the latest COUNTRY command.    The  V switch performs the same read-after-write checking as the SET VERIFY ON global  verify ﬂag.  To use XCOPY to copy empty source subdirectories, you must specify both the  S and  E switches.  The XCOPY command is one of the most useful DOS ﬁle commands available. To copy the source ﬁles of an entire program  such as Windows 95  to the hard drive, for exam- ple, it is much easier to use the XCOPY command with wildcards and the  S switch  to copy subdirectories  than to attempt to drill down and copy each directory by itself with the COPY command.  Using XCOPY Effectively Using XCOPY, you can control by date or archive attribute the ﬁles copied, you can copy complete subdirectory trees, and you can conﬁrm which ﬁles to copy. The command has several ideal uses: copying ﬁles selectively between disks or directories, performing a quick hard disk backup  backing up only a few critical ﬁles in several subdirectories , and keeping the directories of two or more computers synchronized.  With COPY, your control is limited. COPY duplicates all ﬁles that match the given name—an all-or-nothing approach. If you use the  P switch with XCOPY, however, DOS asks whether you want to copy each ﬁle.  Using XCOPY is practical if you want to make backup copies of something less than a disk full of ﬁles from several directories. Rather than BACKUP, you might prefer to use the command XCOPY  A to select ﬁles that have changed since the last backup.   Copying Files  209  Part II Ch 8  Keep the following points in mind when you use XCOPY to back up a disk:     If you suspect that the ﬁles cannot ﬁt on one disk, be sure to use the  M switch. As XCOPY copies each ﬁle, the command resets the ﬁle’s archive attribute bit. When the destination disk is full, XCOPY stops. At this point, you can change disks and restart the XCOPY command, again using the  M switch. XCOPY copies the ﬁles whose archive bit has not yet been reset.    XCOPY cannot break a large source ﬁle between destination disks. If you need to  back up a ﬁle that doesn’t ﬁt on a single ﬂoppy disk, you must use BACKUP.    A favorite use of XCOPY is to synchronize the contents of the hard disks of two computers. Many people have one computer at work and another at home. If both computers have hard disks, keeping the copies of programs and data ﬁles current is a major task. Which ﬁles did you change today? Which machine has the more current version?    When you want to keep separate hard disks synchronized, you might ﬁnd the  XCOPY command’s  A,  D:date, and  S switches especially useful. The  S switch forces XCOPY to traverse your disk’s directory structure, playing a hunting game for source ﬁles. Whether you use  A or  D depends on how often you copy ﬁles between the machines. If you copy ﬁles between the machines frequently, you might prefer the  A switch. If you allow many days to pass between synchro- nizing your computers’ contents, you might ﬁnd that the  D switch works better. Use  D if you have run BACKUP on the source machine since you last used XCOPY. BACKUP resets the archive attribute so that the command’s  A switch does not catch all ﬁles changed between XCOPY backups.  ➔ For more information on backing up ﬁles, see “Understanding Microsoft Backup,” p. 233.  Duplicating Disks with XCOPY The XCOPY command can be used to create duplicate ﬂoppy disks, even when the disks are different sizes or formats. You can’t make a disk hold more than its capacity, of course, so you can’t use XCOPY to copy a full 1.44MB ﬂoppy disk onto a 720KB disk. You can, however, transfer the contents and directory structures of a 1.2MB 5 1 4-inch disk to a 1.44MB  3 1 2-inch disk, or a 720KB 3 1 2-inch disk to a 1.2MB or 1.44MB disk. Assume that you have a 720KB disk with several levels of directories in drive B, for example, and you want  to copy it to a 1.2MB disk in drive A. To do so, you issue the following command: XCOPY B: A:  S  Duplicating a Directory Branch For this example, assume that your hard disk has a subdirectory named \WPFILES that  contains a few word processing ﬁles. \WPFILES also has two subdirectories. The ﬁrst, \WPFILES\MEMOS, contains your current memos; the second, \WPFILES\DOCS, contains your   210  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  document ﬁles. You want to keep a current set of the ﬁles in these three directories stored on a ﬂoppy disk. To copy all the ﬁles in this directory branch to the ﬂoppy disk, issue the following command: XCOPY C:\WPFILES A:\WPFILES\  S  XCOPY immediately begins to read the source directories. DOS displays the following  messages: Reading source file s ... C:\WPFILES\LET9_1.WP C:\WPFILES\LET9_2.WP C:\WPFILES\LET9_3.WP C:\WPFILES\LET9_4.WP C:\WPFILES\LET9_5.WP C:\WPFILES\DOCS\SCHEDULE.DOC C:\WPFILES\MEMOS\SALES.MEM  7 File s  copied  Because you included the  S switch, XCOPY copied the ﬁles in C:\WPFILES, C:\WPFILES\MEMOS, and C:\WPFILES\DOCS. The A:\WPFILES path parameter causes XCOPY to ask whether the name speciﬁes a directory or a ﬁle. \WPFILES conceivably can be a user ﬁle in the root directory. The full pathname of each ﬁle is echoed to the screen as the ﬁle is copied to drive A. When the command ﬁnishes, the \WPFILES directory branch has been copied to drive A.  As another example, assume that your PC experiences a hardware failure and needs to go to the shop for repairs. You want to use your ﬂoppy disk that contains the \WPFILES directory branch to place that directory branch on a second computer’s hard disk. To do so, enter the following command: XCOPY A: C:  S  XCOPY reverses the copy process described in the preceding paragraphs by copying all the ﬁles on drive A to corresponding subdirectory locations on drive C.  Copying Entire Disks with DISKCOPY  The external DISKCOPY command makes exact duplicates of a disk. Duplication is so com- plete that even ﬁle fragmentation is preserved. If the target disk has not yet been formatted, DISKCOPY automatically formats it before performing the duplication.  DISKCOPY does have one major limitation. You can copy only like media to like media.  A 1.2MB disk, for example, can be successfully copied only to another 1.2MB disk. You cannot use DISKCOPY to duplicate a 720KB ﬂoppy disk on a 1.44MB disk. See the section on using XCOPY to duplicate disks earlier in this chapter for information on duplicating unlike disks.  The syntax for DISKCOPY is as follows: DISKCOPY SourceDisk TargetDisk  1  V  M   Copying Files  211  Part II Ch 8  The source disk is the drive letter that holds the original disk to be duplicated. The target disk is the optional name of the drive that holds the disk to receive the copy. This destina- tion drive is sometimes called the target drive. If you don’t specify a drive name for the  target, DOS assumes that you want to use the current drive and prompts you to insert and remove source and destination disks as necessary.  Only three switches are recognized by DISKCOPY. The  1 switch causes DOS to copy only the ﬁrst side of a double-sided disk. This switch, which is a holdover from old versions  of DOS, enables you to copy single-sided disks. Chances are, you will never need the   1 switch.  The  V switch instructs DOS to verify that the copy and original are identical. This switch slows down operations by adding the extra comparison step. You use this switch only when you are working with disks that you will never have an opportunity to copy again and you need to make absolutely sure you got a clean copy.  The  M switch forces DISKCOPY to work in memory only. Using this switch means that DISKCOPY does not use temporary ﬁles on your hard disk to aid in duplication. Instead, all operations are performed in memory. This method of operation effectively forces you to swap disks during the copy, as was required in older versions of DOS.  If you leave out the drive names in the DISKCOPY command line, DOS uses the current drive as the speciﬁer. If you have a system with only one disk drive or if the second disk drive supports only different formats, you can simply issue this command: DISKCOPY  Remember to log on to the drive you want to use before issuing the command. DOS prompts you to insert the source disk and target disk at the appropriate times.  The following is the classic example of the DISKCOPY command: DISKCOPY A: B:  This example assumes that both drive A and drive B contain disks having the same capacity. After you issue the DISKCOPY command, DOS prompts you to insert the disks into the proper drives. Make sure that you insert the disks into the correct drives. Write-protect the source disk to safeguard its contents in case of a disk mix-up.  When the disks are in place, you are ready to continue. Press any key to start the DISKCOPY process. When the process is complete, DOS asks whether you want to make another copy. Press Y to copy another disk or N to exit the command  see Figure 8.3 . If the drives or disks are not compatible, an error message appears, and nothing is copied  see Figure 8.4 .   212  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Figure 8.3 A typical DISKCOPY command sequence and messages from DOS.  Figure 8.4 An error message produced by the DISKCOPY com- mand.  C:\>DISKCOPY A: B: Insert SOURCE diskette in drive A: Insert TARGET diskette in drive B: Press any key to continue . . .

Drive types or diskette types not compatible Copy process ended Copy another diskette  Y N ?   Moving Files  In early versions of DOS, if you wanted to move a ﬁle from one place to another, you had to ﬁrst copy the ﬁle and then delete the original. Now DOS enables you to move ﬁles from one location to another using the MOVE command.  The MOVE command’s syntax is similar to the syntax for COPY. In effect, the syntax of the MOVE command says, “MOVE THIS THERE.”  In a MOVE command, the order of the parameter requirements always moves from the source to the destination, or target. The full syntax for the MOVE command is as follows: MOVE SourceExpression s  TargetExpression  Y  If you omit a path parameter from both the source and target, you either copy or rename the source ﬁle, depending on whether the speciﬁed target ﬁlename exists. If the name exists, you copy the source ﬁle over the target ﬁle, eliminating the target ﬁle. If the name does not exist, you rename the source ﬁle.  If your source parameter includes only one ﬁle, you can rename the ﬁle as you move it by specifying a new ﬁlename or extension as part or all of the target parameter. If your source parameter includes more than one ﬁle, you cannot use a ﬁlename and extension parameter as part of the target parameter. If you do so, however, DOS assumes that you want the tar- get ﬁle to be the target for all the ﬁles to be moved, and the message Cannot move multiple files to a single file appears. You must, however, specify either a drive or directory as the target.  The  Y switch indicates whether you want MOVE to overwrite ﬁles with the same name without prompting. You also can use the  -Y switch to indicate that you want to be prompted.   Moving Files  213  As an example of how to use MOVE, suppose you want to move a ﬁle called BUDGET01.WQ1 from a directory called C:\SPREADSH\QPRO4DAT to a directory called D:\OLDFILES  assuming neither directory is current . In this case, you enter this command: MOVE C:\SPREADSH\QPRO4DAT\BUDGET01.WQ1 D:\OLDFILES  If the move is successful, DOS displays the following message: c:\spreadsh\qpro4dat\budget01.wq1 => d:\oldfiles\budget.wq1 [ok]  Part II Ch 8  If the source and target parameters represent the same ﬁle, DOS erases the ﬁle without warning you.  Moving Directories and Files  You can use MOVE to move ﬁles from one directory to another. If the target directory doesn’t exist, the MOVE command creates it. Figure 8.5 shows the MOVE command moving all the ﬁles in H:\TEST to a new TEST directory on drive G.  Figure 8.5 Moving all the ﬁles in a directory.  H:\>rd g:\test  H:\>move h:\test\*.* g:\test Make directory “g:\test”?

Because the directory doesn’t exist on drive G, MOVE prompts you to make sure that you intend to create a new directory to hold the moved ﬁles. As each ﬁle is moved, MOVE displays the original name, a => symbol, and the new name of each ﬁle.  The MOVE command has no effect on H:\TEST other than to remove the ﬁles from the direc- tory. The source directory is not deleted from drive H. Also, the MOVE command pays no attention to the read-only ﬁle attribute. Even ﬁles marked read-only are moved.   214  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Renaming Directories with MOVE  Another use for the MOVE command is to rename a directory, as shown in the following example: MOVE C:\MEMOS  C:\LETTERS  The effect of the sample command is to rename the MEMOS directory as LETTERS without affecting the ﬁles contained in the directory.  Setting Defaults for COPY, XCOPY, and MOVE  If you are using DOS 6.22, you can use a new environment variable to specify how you want all three ﬁle-management commands—COPY, XCOPY, and MOVE—to work. The COPYCMD envi- ronment variable is similar to the DIRCMD environment variable discussed in the section “Customizing the DIR Command” earlier in this chapter; it sets default switches that DOS uses whenever you issue the COPY, XCOPY, or MOVE commands.  The command to set the COPYCMD environment variable is as follows: SET COPYCMD=switches  For the switches parameter, substitute the switch or switches you want DOS to use auto- matically. If, for example, you do not want DOS to prompt you when it is about to over- write a destination ﬁle, include the following command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle: SET COPYCMD= Y  Then reboot the computer. DOS creates the environment variable COPYCMD and gives it the value  Y. Each time you issue the DIR command, DOS adds this switch automatically.  You can override a switch that is recorded in COPYCMD by preceding the switch with a minus sign  – . To override the  Y switch that is currently recorded in COPYCMD  so that DOS tells you when it will overwrite a ﬁle , for example, issue the COPY command as shown here: COPY  -Y  Renaming Files  If copying ﬁles is the most common ﬁle-related function of DOS, renaming ﬁles probably follows close on its heels. The reasons for renaming a ﬁle are many. You might want to use the current ﬁlename for another ﬁle, or perhaps you want to create a name that better describes the contents of the current ﬁle. Whatever the reason, DOS enables you to rename a ﬁle using the internal command RENAME. Like some other DOS commands, RENAME also has a short form, REN. Which form you use depends on how you feel about typing three extra letters.  The DOS rename operation changes the name in a ﬁle’s directory entry, but the ﬁle and its physical location on the disk remain unchanged. Because two ﬁles in the same directory can- not have the same name, DOS does not change a ﬁlename if the new ﬁlename already exists.   Comparing Files  215  Part II Ch 8  The syntax for RENAME is either of the following: RENAME OldExpression NewExpression  REN OldExpression NewExpression  The REN command requires two parameters. OldExpression is a ﬁlename expression that speciﬁes the ﬁles to be renamed. NewExpression is a ﬁlename expression that speciﬁes what the new names of the ﬁles will be. Consider this example: REN MEMO.TXT MEMO12.TXT  This example renames the ﬁle MEMO.TXT as MEMO12.TXT.  You also can use wildcards to specify groups of ﬁles to be renamed. Suppose, for example, that you have a group of ﬁles named MEMO1.TXT, MEMO2.TXT, and so on in your directory. To rename them, you can issue this command: REN MEMO?.TXT LTR?.DOC  The result is that MEMO1.TXT is renamed as LTR1.DOC, MEMO2.TXT becomes LTR2.DOC, and so on.  When you use RENAME, remember the following guidelines:    You can use the commands REN and RENAME interchangeably at the command line. Both  commands produce identical results.    You must supply both an old ﬁlename and a new ﬁlename. The ﬁlenames can contain  wildcards for DOS to use in pattern matching.    You cannot use the RENAME operation to move a ﬁle from one directory or disk to  another directory or disk.  If you are not sure which ﬁles a wildcard parameter will match, issue the DIR com- mand, using the wildcard pattern that you plan to use in the ﬁlename parameter. DIR lists the matching ﬁlenames. Study these names carefully to see whether using the wild- card pattern with the RENAME command will produce the result you expect.  Comparing Files  MS-DOS 6.22 contains a program called FC that allows you to compare ﬁles to verify their integrity. For example, if you have your entire company’s budget in a ﬁle and you wanted to make a copy of it to store offsite, using the FC command to verify that the copied ﬁle is exactly the same would provide an additional veriﬁcation that it is a valid copy. The follow- ing sections will describe how to use the FC command effectively.  Comparing Files with FC  The external command FC  meaning ﬁle comparison  compares two ﬁles or two sets of ﬁles to ﬁnd differences in the ﬁles. Any differences are reported onscreen. When a copied ﬁle is extremely important, you can use FC to compare the ﬁle with the original. If differences are   216  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  found, you know that a problem might exist with the copy. Normally, DOS detects data integrity errors while reading and writing ﬁles, but if you want to be sure that two ﬁles are the same, you can ease your mind by using FC.  PC DOS versions 1.0 through 5.0 and MS-DOS versions 3.3 through 5.0 include a sim- pler ﬁle comparison command, COMP. This command, however, is less versatile than FC, provides less information, has fewer options, and cannot compare ﬁles of different lengths.  The FC command has two general syntax forms. One form uses the  B switch for a forced binary comparison; the other form uses the remaining switches in an ASCII comparison. The two forms of syntax are as follows: FC  B SourceExpression TargetExpression  FC  A  C  L  LBn  N  nnnn  T  W SourceExpression TargetExpression  The source expression speciﬁes the originals of the ﬁles to be compared. If you use wildcard characters in this parameter, all ﬁles matching this parameter are compared with the second ﬁle.  The target expression speciﬁes the ﬁles to be compared to the originals. Usually, you need to specify only the drive and directory part of a ﬁlename expression. FC compares those ﬁles speciﬁed in the source expression that can be found in the target directory.  If you use wildcard characters in both the source and target expressions, FC compares the ﬁles as sets. That is, only those ﬁles whose names match in other respects are com- pared.  If you use the command FC *.WK1 *.BAK, for example, FC compares each worksheet ﬁle having the extension .WK1 with the worksheet ﬁle having the same base name and the extension .BAK. AUGSEPT.WK1, for example, is compared with AUGSEPT.BAK. FC does not compare every worksheet ﬁle with every backup ﬁle.  The switches used by FC enable you to control the operations of the command more tightly. The switches used are as follows:     A instructs FC to abbreviate its output  DOS 3.2 and later versions , displaying only the  ﬁrst and last lines of each set of differences separated by an ellipsis  … .     B performs a binary  byte-by-byte  comparison, showing the hexadecimal address and     C causes FC to ignore the case of alphabetic characters when making comparisons; thus,  value of every differing byte.  c = C.     L instructs FC to compare the ﬁles in ASCII mode, even when the ﬁles have EXE, COM,  SYS, OBJ, LIB, or BIN extensions  DOS 3.2 and later versions .   Comparing Files  217     LBn sets the number of lines in the FC command’s buffer to n. The default number is  100  DOS 3.2 and later versions . If the number of consecutive nonmatching lines exceeds the buffer size, FC aborts the compare operation.     N instructs FC to include the line numbers of lines reported in the output  DOS 3.2 and  later versions .  resynchronize FC.     nnnn establishes the number of lines that must match after a difference in order to     T instructs FC to view tab characters as literal characters rather than tab-expanded     W instructs FC to compress whitespace—tabs, empty lines, and spaces—into a single  spaces  DOS 3.2 and later versions .  space for purposes of ﬁle comparison.  Part II Ch 8  Understanding the Operation of FC FC works in two modes: ASCII and binary. It defaults to ASCII mode comparison when the ﬁles to be compared do not have extensions  EXE, COM, SYS, OBJ, LIB, or BIN  that traditionally indicate binary ﬁles.  In ASCII mode, FC compares two ﬁles line-by-line. Lines from both ﬁles are held in a line buffer. FC uses the lines in the buffer to compare the ﬁrst ﬁle to the second.  If FC detects a difference, it displays the ﬁrst ﬁlename followed by the last matching line and the mismatching line or lines from the ﬁrst ﬁle. It then displays the next line to match in both ﬁles.  After displaying mismatch information about ﬁle 1, FC repeats the same sequence for ﬁle 2. The ﬁle 2 name is displayed ﬁrst, followed by the last matching line and the mismatching lines from ﬁle 2, ending on the next line that matches in both ﬁles, thus synchronizing the two ﬁles.  FC can help you determine whether the contents of two ﬁles are different by showing you the extent and location of any mismatch it ﬁnds. You can use this output as an alternative to a side-by-side comparison of the ﬁle contents.  If you are comparing two ﬁles that are not the same, you can quickly stop the reporting of differences by pressing Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break.  In binary mode, FC compares two ﬁles byte-for-byte. At the ﬁrst difference, the byte offset position in the ﬁrst ﬁle is reported along with the value of the two ﬁles’ bytes at that posi- tion. The offset and byte values are reported in hexadecimal  base 16  form. This form of FC is essentially equivalent to the older COMP command.  In binary mode, FC does not attempt to resynchronize the two ﬁles by ﬁnding an adjusted point of byte agreement. If one ﬁle has an additional byte at one place in the ﬁle, FC reports the additional byte and all subsequent bytes of the ﬁle as mismatches.   218  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  If one ﬁle is longer than its comparison ﬁle, the binary mode compares as many bytes as are present and then reports that one ﬁle is longer. When a binary ﬁle comparison results in a long listing of differences, you might want to stop the FC operation by pressing Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break.  Only one switch is available in the binary mode. The  B switch causes the comparison to be binary even if ﬁle extensions indicate that the ﬁles are not binary. You use the  B switch to compare two text ﬁles in binary mode. You might ﬁnd situations in which you prefer to have the binary-mode output format of FC than the ASCII mode format. Binary mode format reports differences as pairs of hexadecimal values. You then can see the values of characters, such as Ctrl+G  bell , that do not produce printed output.  When you use FC, keep in mind that the default number of lines that must match in an ASCII comparison after a difference has ended is two. The ﬁles are then considered resyn- chronized. Using the  nnnn switch, you can change the number of “must match” lines by setting nnnn to the desired value.  Using FC to Compare a Copied File to Its Original Suppose that you are copying the ANSI.SYS ﬁle from your hard disk to a ﬂoppy disk to use for an important demonstration on another PC. When the copy is complete, you set the disk on the edge of your desk and go to the break room to get coffee. When you return, you notice that the disk has fallen off your desk and landed against the small transformer that runs your cassette recorder. You are worried that the magnetic ﬁeld from the transformer has damaged ANSI.SYS. To verify that the copied ANSI.SYS ﬁle is good, you can compare it to the original by using the following command: FC A:ANSI.SYS C:\DOS\DRIVERS\ANSI.SYS  After a few seconds, FC reports FC: No differences encountered. The copy of ANSI.SYS seems to be good.  Comparing Two Text Files Suppose that two similar text ﬁles, ORIGINAL.TXT and ANOTHER.TXT, are located in the default directory of the current drive. ORIGINAL.TXT contains the following text: This is the first line. This is the second line. 1 2 3 4 5 This is the last line.  ANOTHER.TXT contains the following text: This is the first line. This is not the third line. 1 2   Comparing Files  219  Part II Ch 8  Note that ANOTHER.TXT has four more lines than ORIGINAL.TXT and that the second lines of the ﬁles contain differing text. These simple ﬁles illustrate how FC reports differences. You can use the principles illustrated here to understand the result of comparisons of more com- plex ﬁles. If, for example, you want to compare the two ﬁles that are in the same directory, you issue the following command: FC ORIGINAL.TXT ANOTHER.TXT  FC makes the following report: Comparing files ORIGINAL.TXT and ANOTHER.TXT ***** ORIGINAL.TXT This is the first line. This is the second line. 1 ***** ANOTHER.TXT This is the first line. This is not the third line. 1 *****  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 This is the last line.  ***** ORIGINAL.TXT 5 This is the last line. ***** ANOTHER.TXT 5 6 7 8 9 This is the last line. *****  FC displays the lines before and after the mismatched line, if any exist. It also ﬁnds mis- matches that are not on equivalent lines so that it can match text even when one ﬁle con- tains material not found in the other. The second report concerning ANOTHER.TXT shows all the lines between the one containing the numeral 5 and the one containing the text This is the last line. Only these two matching lines appear in the report concerning ORIGINAL.TXT.  Comparing Disks with DISKCOMP  You can conﬁrm that two disks are identical by using the external command DISKCOMP,  which compares each track of one disk to each track of another disk sector-by-sector. Like DISKCOPY, DISKCOMP is a ﬂoppy-only command; you cannot use DISKCOMP to compare two   220  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  hard disks. Furthermore, the disk types and capacities must be the same for both disks in the comparison; any difference in disks made with DISKCOPY is a sign of a problem disk.  One practical use of DISKCOMP is comparing a master disk included with a software package to a working copy of that disk. DISKCOMP conﬁrms whether the working copy is good.  Normally, you use DISKCOMP to test disks that were made from originals with the DISKCOPY command. Because DISKCOMP doesn’t write any information to either disk, both disks can be write-protected. If the disks are identical, DOS displays the message Compare OK.  The syntax for DISKCOMP is similar to that for DISKCOPY. The syntax for DISKCOMP is as follows: DISKCOMP SourceDisk TargetDisk  1  8  The source disk is the original, and the target disk is the copy. DISKCOMP recognizes only  two switches. The  1 switch causes DOS to compare only the ﬁrst sides of the disks. The   8 switch compares only the ﬁrst eight sectors of each track on the disks. Both of these switches provide backward compatibility for testing ﬂoppy disks made with very old versions of DOS.  An example of the DISKCOMP command is as follows: DISKCOMP A: B:  When the ﬁrst DISKCOMP operation is complete, DOS asks whether you want to compare another disk.  In the sequence shown in Figure 8.6, a working copy of a master disk is being compared to the original master. Notice the comparison errors. The working copy no longer is reliable, or other ﬁles have been added to the disk since DISKCOPY was used to make a working copy from the master. The best way to solve the problem is to make a new working copy.  Figure 8.6 Comparing a working copy of a master disk to the original disk.  C:\>DISKCOMP A: B: Insert FIRST diskette in drive A: Insert SECOND diskette in drive B: Press any key to continue . . . Comparing 80 tracks 9 sectors per track, 2 side s  Compare error on  side 0, track 0 Compare error on side 0, track 22 Copy another diskette  Y N ? N C:\>  If you issue the DISKCOMP command with no drive parameters, DOS uses only one drive to carry out the comparison and prompts you to insert the ﬁrst and second disks alternately. Depending on your system’s memory, you swap disks once or several times. By entering DISKCOMP alone, without parameters, you tell DOS to use the current ﬂoppy drive even if your system has two ﬂoppy drives. Make sure that you don’t mix up the disks when you’re swapping them. If you don’t keep track of which disk DOS wants in the drive, you might end up comparing part of a disk to itself.   Deleting Files  221  Deleting Files  Because no disk has unlimited storage space and because nearly every ﬁle eventually becomes obsolete, DOS provides a way for you to erase or delete ﬁles from your disks. The internal ERASE command enables you to delete ﬁles you no longer need.  Unlike other DOS commands’ short forms, the ERASE command’s short form is not simply an abbreviation of the keyword. The short form of ERASE is DEL. Because the short form is shorter, thus quicker to type, it is generally used rather than ERASE.  When you delete a ﬁle, DOS locates that ﬁle in the directory and marks the directory entry with a special internal indicator. DOS considers this space to be available for reassignment when a new ﬁle is added to the directory. By reclaiming a deleted ﬁle’s directory entry, DOS can control the expansion of a subdirectory or reclaim one of the limited root directory entries.  Part II Ch 8  Understanding the Delete Operation  The delete operation does not affect the contents of a ﬁle’s allocated clusters. Deleting a ﬁle does not record over the ﬁle’s data in the way erasing a cassette tape records over existing audio. Rather, DOS alters its bookkeeping records in the directory and in the ﬁle allocation table. The directory entry for the ﬁle is “deleted” by changing the ﬁrst character of the ﬁle- name to an unprintable character  E5 hex , and the FAT cluster chain for the ﬁle is deallo- cated. DOS marks the ﬁle’s clusters as being “free.”  The DOS bookkeeping records for the deleted ﬁle remain relatively intact until another ﬁle is added to the directory or until another ﬁle is expanded or added in any directory. The UNDELETE utility  discussed in Chapter 9, “Protecting Your Data,”  takes advantage of the fact that DOS does not erase a ﬁle’s content when you delete the ﬁle. UNDELETE “ﬁxes” the deleted ﬁle’s direc- tory entry and reconstructs the deleted ﬁle’s cluster chain. If another ﬁle has been added, how- ever, the UNDELETE command might not be capable of recovering the deleted ﬁle because DOS might have reallocated some or all of the storage space assigned to the deleted ﬁle.  The syntax for deleting ﬁles is either of the following: DEL FileNameExpression  P  ERASE FileNameExpression  P  The ﬁlename expression speciﬁes the drive, the directory, and or the name of the ﬁles to be deleted. You can use wildcards to specify multiple ﬁles.  Using the optional  P switch causes DEL  or ERASE  to prompt you for conﬁrmation before DOS deletes each ﬁle. Press Y to instruct DOS to delete a ﬁle or press N to skip the ﬁle without erasing it.  When you are executing a delete operation, remember the following guidelines:    At the command line, the DEL  or ERASE  command does not erase ﬁles marked with the  read-only, hidden, or system attribute.   222  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files    The delete operation does not remove a directory, erase a volume label, or erase a hid-  den or system ﬁle.    If you specify a directory name as the ﬁlename expression on the DEL command line,  DOS tries to delete all the ﬁles in the speciﬁed subdirectory.  Deleting Files from the Command Line  The internal DEL and ERASE commands remove ﬁles from the disk, returning to the disk the space occupied by the deleted ﬁles. When you use DEL or ERASE to erase a ﬁle, DOS no longer can access the ﬁle. The erased ﬁle’s directory entry and storage space become avail- able to DOS for storage of another ﬁle.  Because DEL  or ERASE  deletes ﬁles from your disk, use the command with caution. DEL accepts wildcards in the ﬁle parameter. A momentary lapse of your attention while you are using DEL can wipe out important data in the blink of an eye.  Deleting Unwanted Files  Suppose that you have completed and delivered a series of memos composed in your word processing program. That program automatically creates in the C:\WP directory a backup ﬁle, with a BAK extension, for each memo. You want to keep the memo ﬁles on disk so that you can refer to them, but after the memos are safely delivered, you do not need the BAK ﬁles. You can erase the ﬁles with BAK extensions one at a time, or you can issue the DEL com- mand as follows: DEL C:\WP\*.BAK  In this command line, the *.BAK ﬁlename parameter instructs DOS to delete all the ﬁles with the BAK extension. When the DEL command completes its work, all ﬁles with BAK exten- sions are removed from the directory. Because this command line includes drive and path parameters, you can issue the command from any logged disk and current directory and still erase the BAK ﬁles in C:\WP.  Using Interlnk to Share Another Computer’s Resources  More and more users now have come to own more than one computer. Often they have a desktop machine in the ofﬁce and a notebook or laptop computer they use when they travel. Although having two computers extends your computing power to places other than your ofﬁce, having two computers also can make it difﬁcult to keep data in both places up-to- date. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for two users in an ofﬁce to need to share ﬁles, and maybe even a printer, at times.   Using Interlnk to Share Another Computer’s Resources  223  The DOS feature called Interlnk enables you to access drives and printers on a remote com- puter as though they were part of your computer. You can use this feature to transfer ﬁles from a laptop or notebook computer to your desktop computer, to print ﬁles from your portable computer on a printer attached to your desktop computer, and even to run pro- grams directly from the remote computer.  When you use Interlnk, one computer—the server—becomes the completely passive “slave” of the other. Before you start, decide which computer you want to work on. The server should be the computer with the resources—ﬁles or printers—that you want to use remotely.  Part II Ch 8  Setting Up Interlnk  Interlnk uses two executable ﬁles. INTERLNK.EXE makes a machine the client. You must load this ﬁle into the computer by using the DEVICE command in CONFIG.SYS. After the Interlnk client software is loaded, it remains in memory as a terminate-and-stay-resident  TSR  application that responds to a set of commands not normally available in DOS.  INTERSVR is a command run from the DOS prompt. It completely takes over the system to act as an extension to the client computer running INTERLNK.EXE. You can run INTERSVR.EXE in a Windows-hosted DOS session, but while it’s running, all multitasking activities in Windows are suspended.  Interlnk is the name given to the features provided by INTERLNK.EXE and INTERSVR.EXE. INTERLNK and INTERSVR are commands provided by Interlnk. You can tell by the capitalization and the computer font whether the following sections are speaking of Interlnk features or the INTERLNK command.  ➔ Use DOS’s multiple conﬁguration feature to enable your computer to boot with or without INTERLNK.EXE  loaded. For information on multiple conﬁgurations, see Chapter 2, “Starting DOS,” p. 23. You need to have a special cable built for use with Interlnk. The cable connects one machine to the other and can use either a serial or parallel connection. You cannot use a standard printer cable because the connector pins of an Interlnk cable must follow the con- ﬁguration shown in Table 8.2.  Table 8.2 Cable Conﬁgurations for Use with Interlnk  Pin Connections for Serial Port Connections  9 Pin 5  3  7  25 Pin 7  2  4  ↔  ↔  ↔  25 Pin 7  3  5  9 Pin 5*  2  8   224  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Table 8.2 Continued  Pin Connections for Serial Port Connections  9 Pin 6  25 Pin 6  25 Pin 20  2  4  6  9 Pin 4  3  7  6  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  13  12  10  2  3  4  5  6  25  Pin Connections for Parallel Port Connections  25 Pin 2  25 Pin 15  Pin Connections for Parallel Port Connections  25 Pin 6  25 Pin 11  3  5  20  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  ↔  2  8  4  3  4  5  15  13  12  10  11  25  * Ground wire  You can use either a serial or parallel connection to wire the two computers together, but only a serial connection using all seven wires is capable of using the  RCOPY switch of INTERSVR. The  RCOPY switch enables you to connect to computers that do not have Interlnk already installed by copying INTERSVR.EXE to the remote computer and running it.  If you have only a 3-wire, or NULL modem, serial cable, or parallel cable, you need to carry ﬂoppy disks to put INTERSVR.EXE on the slave machine.   Using Interlnk to Share Another Computer’s Resources  225  Loading INTERLNK.EXE  Part II Ch 8  Interlnk uses a client server metaphor to divide the responsibilities of the software. INTERLNK.EXE provides the client portion of Interlnk. The client module takes complete con- trol of the server machine. Disks on the server appear to the client as though they are part of the client machine. Printers on the server are likewise made to appear as though they are attached to the client. INTERLNK.EXE is loaded at boot time via CONFIG.SYS. The syntax to load the Interlnk client portion, INTERLNK.EXE, is as follows: DEVICE=d:path\INTERLNK.EXE  DRIVES:n  NOPRINTER  COM:n  address   LPT:n address  AUTO  NOSCAN  LOW  BAUD:rate  V  The ﬁlename expression d:path indicates the drive and directory where INTERLNK.EXE is writ- ten to disk. The other parameters are as follows:     DRIVES:n speciﬁes the number of redirected drives. The default is 3.    NOPRINTER speciﬁes that printers are not to be redirected. By default, all printers are  redirected.     COM:n address speciﬁes a serial port to be used for data transfer. The port can be  speciﬁed as n, the port number, or the address of the port. If you specify the  COM switch without an accompanying  LPT switch, no parallel port is used. By default, Interlnk scans all available serial ports and uses the ﬁrst port it ﬁnds connected to the server.     LPT:n  address speciﬁes a parallel port to be used for data transfer. The port can be speciﬁed as n, the port number, or the address of the port. By default, the ﬁrst port found connected to the server is used. If you specify the  LPT switch without an accom- panying  COM switch, no serial port is used. By default, all COM and LPT ports are scanned.     AUTO causes Interlnk to be loaded only when a connection is detected. By default,  Interlnk is loaded even when no client server connection is detected.     NOSCAN causes Interlnk to be loaded into memory but not activated until you issue the INTERLNK command. DOS does not recognize the INTERLNK command, however, unless the device driver has been loaded.     LOW speciﬁes that Interlnk is to be installed in conventional memory. By default,  Interlnk is loaded into an upper memory block  UMB  if space is available.     BAUD:rate is used only in serial communications to set the speed at which the two  computers communicate through the serial cable. Valid rates are 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and the default, 115200. If you ﬁnd serial communications unreliable, try lower- ing the baud rate to eliminate transmission errors.     V is used for serial communications to prevent conﬂicts with the computer’s timer. If  one of the computers hangs up when you try to communicate, try the  V switch.  Normally, Interlnk scans all your drives and all your ports when this device driver loads. If you have a serial mouse and plan to run Microsoft Windows, add a parameter that tells   226  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Interlnk which port is connected to the remote computer. If you are using a second printer port for your connection, for example, type the following line: DEVICE=C:\DOS\INTERLNK.EXE  LPT2  This command prevents Interlnk from examining all your serial and parallel ports  and from disrupting your mouse operations in the process .  Loading the Server  INTERSVR is an executable ﬁle, loaded from the command line, that suspends all the opera- tions of the computer and gives control over the computer’s resources to INTERLNK, running on the client computer. You do not have to load INTERLNK.EXE on the server to make an Interlnk connection.  If you load INTERSVR on a machine that is running a multitasking system such as Windows or QEMM, all background operations are suspended until you exit INTERSVR. The syntax to load the server portion of Interlnk, INTERSVR.EXE, is as follows: INTERSVR.EXE  X=drives  COM:n  address  LPT:n address   BAUD:rate  B  V  RCOPY     X speciﬁes the letter or letters of drives to be excluded from redirection. By default, all  drives are redirected. If  X is used, any listed drives are unavailable to the client.     COM:n  address speciﬁes a serial port to be used for data transfer. The port can be  speciﬁed as n, the port number, or the address of the port. If you specify the  COM switch without an accompanying  LPT switch, no parallel port is used. By default, Interlnk scans all available serial ports and uses the ﬁrst port it ﬁnds connected to the client.     LPT:n  address speciﬁes a parallel port to be used for data transfer. The port can be  speciﬁed as n, the port number, or the address of the port. By default, the ﬁrst port found connected to the client is used. If you specify the  LPT switch without an accom- panying  COM switch, no serial port is used. By default, all COM and LPT ports are scanned.     BAUD:rate is used only in serial communications to set the speed at which the two  computers communicate through the serial cable. Valid rates are 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and the default, 115200. If you ﬁnd serial communications unreliable, try lower- ing the baud rate to eliminate transmission errors.     B causes the Interlnk screen to be displayed in monochrome.    V is used for serial communications to prevent conﬂicts with the computer’s timer. If  one of the computers hangs up when you try to communicate, try the  V switch.     RCOPY is used to copy the Interlnk ﬁles from one computer to another. You must be  using a fully pinned serial cable, and the MODE and CTTY commands must be available on the computer where Interlnk is being installed.   Using Interlnk to Share Another Computer’s Resources  227  Establishing the Interlnk Connection  After you load INTERLNK on the client machine, all you have to do is load INTERSVR on the server machine, and you’re in business. When you issue the INTERSVR command on the server, you see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 8.7.  Part II Ch 8  Figure 8.7 INTERSVR, activated and waiting for INTERLNK.  You can use Interlnk for occasional resource sharing. If you constantly interrupt another user’s work, however, to use his or her printer, consider investing in a printer-sharing device or installing a small network.  After you have INTERSVR working on the server, return to the client machine and issue the following command: INTERLNK  This command activates the connection. A message similar to the one shown in Figure 8.8 appears, telling you how you can access the server’s resources.  Figure 8.8 Establishing the Interlnk connection.  Scanning  Port=LPT2  This Computer        Other Computer   Client                Server   ------------   ------------------------ D:          equals    A: E:          equals    C: 42Mb  LPT1:       equals    LPT2:  This message tells you that drive A of the remote computer now is available to you as drive D of your local computer, and drive C of the remote computer now is drive E of your local computer.   228  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Using Interlnk to Transfer Files  After you have Interlnk running on both computers, you can use standard DOS commands to gain access to the server’s resources.  Using the values shown in Figure 8.8, if you want to see a directory on drive C of the remote computer, type the following command: DIR E:  To copy ﬁles from one computer to the other, issue a COPY  or XCOPY  command, with a drive of one computer as the source and a drive of the other computer as the target. To copy C:\SPREADSH\BUDGET.WQ1 from your local computer to the server, for example, you issue a command such as this: COPY C:\SPREADSH\BUDGET.WQ1 E:\SPREADSH  Using a Remote Printer  Suppose that your remote computer is connected to a laser printer and your local computer isn’t. The status report indicates that LPT1 of your computer is linked to LPT2 of the remote computer. Assuming that the laser printer is attached to LPT2 on that computer, you install your program to print its ﬁle to LPT2. Interlnk takes care of redirecting the print job to the server.  Installing Interlnk Remotely  If one of your computers is running DOS 6.22 and the other is running a version of DOS older than DOS 6.0, Interlnk will not be installed. Interlnk can install itself on the remote computer, however, if it is running on the local computer and if the computers are connected via a serial cable using all seven pins. A parallel cable does not sufﬁce. Also, the MODE command must be available on the remote unit. On the local computer, issue the following command: INTERLNK  RCOPY  You are prompted to select the serial port to be used. After you indicate that port, go to the remote computer and type the following commands: MODE COMn:2400,N,8,1,P CTTY COMn:  In these commands, n represents the number of the serial port you are using on the remote computer. This parameter forces the remote computer to accept input from the speciﬁed serial port. When you ﬁnish typing these commands, return to the computer on which Interlnk is installed and press Enter. Messages on both computers tell you that INTERLNK.EXE and INTERSVR.EXE are being copied. On the receiving computer, the message looks like the following example: Loading bootstrap  Receiving INTERSVR.EXE  37266  100%  Receiving INTERLNK.EXE  17133  100%   Case Study: Editing Files with Multiple Data Formats  229  The ﬁles are placed in the current directory of the receiving computer. Both computers then return to DOS. You can use either computer as the client or the server, provided that you install the device driver in the server’s CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. If the remote computer is running an early version of DOS, however  3.3 or earlier, for example , you might not be able to access ﬁles on the server that were created under a version of DOS later than DOS 5.0, especially if those ﬁles are larger than 32MB.  Running Programs Remotely  After you are linked to another computer by Interlnk, you can use that computer’s drives as though they were part of your local computer. Thus, you can run a program on the remote computer from the command line as you run one on your local computer.  Because programs on the remote computer do not appear on your local computer’s path, you must either log on to the drive and directory where the program resides or enter a PATH command to extend the client’s path to a remote directory on the server.  Which technique is appropriate depends on how the program works. If, for example, the program must be run from its home directory when it is not on the path, use the ﬁrst option. Otherwise, you can use the second technique.  The preceding techniques actually just load the program from the remote computer and run it on your local computer. Consequently, you might encounter problems if the program is set up to use speciﬁc aspects of the remote computer’s hardware that the local computer lacks. Suppose, for example, that the two computers have different types of screens. The program might be set up to display text and graphics on the remote computer’s screen and might be unable to display anything on your local computer.  Another problem occurs if the program expects to ﬁnd speciﬁc ﬁles on a particular drive but cannot access the drive because the drive names have been changed. Drive C still is drive C of your local computer, but drive C of the remote computer now is known to DOS as drive E of your local computer. If the program needs to ﬁnd certain ﬁles in drive C, it cannot ﬁnd those ﬁles unless they also exist in the same directory of your local computer.  In such a case, don’t run the program from the remote computer; use the version on your local com- puter instead.   Case Study: Editing Files with Multiple Data Formats  One problem you commonly encounter when attempting to edit ﬁles is multiple data for- mats. Some ﬁles contain a mixture of binary and ASCII data. Almost all modern applications store data and documents in proprietary ﬁle formats that contain binary elements. Many of these proprietary formats use a binary header. A header is a block of information at the beginning of a ﬁle that is used by a program as a map to the contents of the ﬁle.   230  Chapter 8 Managing Your Files  Editing this type of ﬁle with a tool other than the program that created it can be dangerous. You can change the ﬁle so that the parent program no longer recognizes the ﬁle as being in the proper format.  If you know that a ﬁle was created by a speciﬁc application, use that application to view and edit the ﬁle. The parent application usually has a method of turning data into ASCII format, either with a conversion utility or by a special ﬁle save feature built into the application. See your application’s documentation for details.

These days drives aver- age 4GB–20GB in size, with drives in newer high-end systems hitting as much as 40 or 60GB.  Older systems, however, might have hard drives of only 500MB, and possibly small- er.  The hard drive stores the operating system and application files installed on the system. It typically also includes all the personal and business data that has been loaded or created on that system. The software and data represent a significant investment in money and effort that would be lost if your hard disk were damaged or erased.  Today’s personal computers are reliable and economical data processing machines. Like all other machines, however, computers are subject to failures and operator errors. Table 9.1 lists some hardware and software problems discussed in this chapter and suggests ways to prevent these problems.  Table 9.1 Hardware and Software Problems and Prevention Techniques  Problem Static electricity  Overheating  Damaged floppy disks  Data loss  Viruses  Prevention Use antistatic liquid or floor mat; place a “touch pad” on desk.  Clean clogged air vents; remove objects that block vents; use air- conditioned room during the summer.  Don’t leave floppy disks to be warped by the sun; avoid spilling liquids on them; store disks in a safe place; avoid magnetic fields from appliances  televisions, microwave ovens, and so on ; if you’re using 5.25-inch flop- pies, do not use a ballpoint pen to write on the disk labels.  Keep current backups of your hard disk and any floppy disks that contain important data; scan for viruses; use delete-tracking.  Always scan a questionable disk for viruses before copying any files from it to your hard disk.  Always be cautious about your computer’s environment. With the low cost of surge suppres- sors and desktop UPS systems, you would be wise to use one of them. If lightning or anoth- er sort of power surge destroys your brand-new Pentium III system, you will regret not spending $60 on an uninterruptible power supply  UPS  surge suppressor.  Your computer might perform erratically when it is too hot. Because circuits are unreliable when they overheat, you might get jumbled data. Make sure that your computer has room to breathe by cleaning the air vents and allowing plenty of space for air to circulate.  You generate static electricity on your body when humidity is low, when you wear synthetic fabrics, or when you walk on carpet. Just by touching your keyboard while carrying a static charge, you can send an electrical shudder through your computer, causing a data jumble or circuit failure. Fortunately, you can avoid static problems by touching your grounded system cabinet before touching the keyboard. If static electricity is a serious problem for you, ask your dealer about antistatic products, which are inexpensive and easy to use.   Understanding Microsoft Backup  233  Finally, be sure to keep your computer clean and free of dust. It is usually a good idea to use a can of compressed air to blow out the dust that accumulates over time. Take special care to keep the fan outlet on the power supply clean and free of anything that will impede airflow.  Understanding Microsoft Backup  Compared to floppy disks, hard disks have many advantages. Hard disks are faster, have larg- er storage capacities and root directories, support multiple partitions, and never require a disk swap. A file on a hard disk can be many times the size of a file on a floppy disk. Commands such as COPY and XCOPY enable you to keep a few duplicate files on a floppy for backup pur- poses, but DOS provides a pair of special programs specifically designed for the big jobs: Microsoft Backup  MSBACKUP.EXE  and Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x  MWBACKUP.EXE .  Part II Ch 9  Starting with Windows 95, Microsoft has moved to a graphical backup program. The ver- sion of DOS that is installed with Windows 9x does not include the command-prompt back- up utility.  For more information on using the Windows 95 98 ME backup utility, see Que’s Special Edition Using Windows 95, Special Edition Using Windows 98, or Special Edition Using Windows Millennium.  By default, the Setup program installed one of these programs when you installed DOS on your computer. If your system has Microsoft Windows 3.1, however, you have the option of installing both programs. As you might expect, Microsoft Backup for Windows can be used only within Microsoft Windows. The DOS version, however, can be used either at a com- mand prompt or in a DOS window within Microsoft Windows.  If you do not now use Microsoft Windows but plan to add that operating environment to your system later, you must reinstall DOS to install the Windows version of the backup program.  Both backup programs are full-featured programs that enable you to perform the following tasks:    Copy files from a hard disk to another disk, usually a floppy disk.   Restore the copied files to their original location or to another disk of your choice.   Compare files on your backup copies with the originals to ensure their validity.  Both programs have several types of menus and many options to enable you to copy only those files you want to copy and to ease the process of making backups regularly. Because the programs are similar, this chapter focuses on MSBACKUP. Relevant differences in the Windows version are noted.   234  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  The files copied to the backup disk do not have the same format as files on your hard disk or files copied with the COPY or XCOPY commands. The directories of disks written by the backup programs show only one file per disk, taking all the available space, as in the fol- lowing example:  Volume in drive A is DEFAULT FUL  Directory of A:\  CC30914A 001   1,457,664 09-14-93   6:02a  1 file s     1,457,664 bytes  0 bytes free  These files might actually contain the data that originally appeared in many files on your hard disk, along with information about their original location. Before you can use these files, you must restore them by using the Restore portion of one of the Backup programs.  Both versions of the Backup program can read backup disks created by the other version. You need not worry, therefore, about losing access to backup data if you switch from one version of the program to the other.  Backup disks contain not only special copies of files but also directory information about each file. This information enables the programs to copy the backup files to their original locations in the directory tree.  The Backup programs can spread a single file across more than one floppy disk. This capa- bility enables you to copy to multiple disks files that are too big to fit on a single disk. If a backup operation uses more than one disk, each disk is linked internally to the next disk to form a backup set.  During the backup operation, each disk in a set is filled to capacity before the next disk is requested. If a file is only partially written to a backup disk when the disk reaches full capac- ity, the remainder of the file is written to the next disk in the set.  Like XCOPY, the Backup programs can copy files selectively. You can specify a directory or branch of directories, a filename, a filename patterned after a wildcard, and additional selec- tion switches. By taking advantage of the programs’ selectivity, you can maintain more than one set of backup disks, each set having its own logical purpose.  You can, for example, keep one backup set that contains every file on your hard disk. This set is insurance against data loss resulting from a hard disk failure or crash. You might have another backup set that contains only the files that have their archive attributes turned on. With an archive set for each day of the week, you can recover a week’s worth of data between complete backups. When your hard disk fails, you replace it, restore using the full set, and then update with the daily sets.  You can lose the data on your hard disk in many ways. If you have not replicated the data, you might be forced to re-create the data and suffer the consequences of permanent data loss if you cannot re-create the data.   Understanding Microsoft Backup  235  Configuring the Backup Programs  Before you can create backups of your data with either backup program, you must first test the program for compatibility. The test is performed automatically the first time you run the program. A special program runs through some of the backup program’s menus, making selections as though you were running the program yourself. This program tests your floppy disk drives and the speed of your processor chip and hard disk. Periodically, dialog boxes appear and ask you for permission to continue. You respond by selecting “buttons” similar to those you might have seen in dialog boxes in the DOS Shell and the DOS Editor. You select options in the same way: by pressing the highlighted letter, by moving the highlight to the desired button with the Tab or Shift+Tab key, or by clicking the desired button. In the DOS version, a highlighted button has pointers at its left and right ends and is a differ- ent color from the other buttons. In the Windows version, the highlighted button is simply a different color.  The program then displays a dialog box that gives you the option of choosing the drive and medium you want to use for the compatibility test  see Figure 9.1 . To select a different capacity disk, move the highlight to the appropriate entry with the cursor keys; then press the spacebar. Choose OK when the setting conforms to your choice.  If you have only one low-density drive, this option is not available.  If you have two drives of the same type, the program uses both, alternating backup disks between the drives.  Part II Ch 9  Figure 9.1 Choosing a disk  drive and capacity for backups.  The program then selects a group of files to back up and completes a backup. This proce- dure requires two floppy disks of the type you selected. Make sure that they do not contain any data you want to save because the disks will be erased completely. The program instructs you when to insert the disks. When the backup is complete, the program compares the data on the backup disks with the source files to verify that the backup is accurate.  Even after you configure one of the backup programs, you still have to configure the sec- ond program. However, the backup files that either program creates can be read by the other program.   236  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  Your computer will probably pass the compatibility test. If it does, you can proceed to make backups with the program. However, the program might display the following warn- ing message: DMA Buffer size too small. You will not be able to perform a backup, compare, or restore until the DMA buffer size is increased. See ‘Troubleshooting’ in your MS-DOS manual.  If this message appears, and you have an 80386 or 80486 microprocessor, use the DEVICE command to load the memory manager EMM386.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS file. Add the para- meter D=64 to the command, as shown in the following line: DEVICE:C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE D=64  If you have an 8088 or 80286 microprocessor and do not use an expanded memory manager, you will not encounter this problem; but the program might still fail the compatibility test.  See Chapter 19, “Configuring Your Computer,” for details on EMM386.EXE and the CONFIG.SYS file.   When you finish running the tests, the programs save your configuration information to disk so that it can be used whenever you run the backup program again.  Understanding Microsoft Backup Functions  Both the DOS and Windows backup programs have five basic functions: Backup, Compare, Restore, Configure, and Quit. In the DOS version, the dialog box shown in Figure 9.2 con- tains buttons representing each function. In the Windows version, the functions are repre- sented by a series of icons near the top of the screen  see Figure 9.3 .  Figure 9.2 The opening DOS Backup dialog box.  The functions are listed here:    Backup duplicates all or selected files from your hard disk onto floppy disks.   Compare compares the files in a set of backup floppy disks to their source on the hard  disk to verify that the copies are accurate.    Restore copies the files on your backup floppy disks to the hard disk, in either their  original location or a new location, or to another floppy disk in usable form.   Understanding Microsoft Backup  237    Configure enables you to select default settings for the program. In the DOS version,  you can choose the following actions:    Change the number of rows of text shown on the screen   Switch to a display using normal text characters rather than the graphics charac-  ters shown in the illustrations here   Adjust the way your mouse behaves   Change the screen colors    Quit enables you to exit the program.  Figure 9.3 The opening Backup for Windows screen.  Part II Ch 9  The Configure options, which appear in Figure 9.4, are similar to the options found on the DOS Shell’s Options menu. You can also select a different drive or disk capacity for your backups or send your backups to a DOS path—that is, a directory on your hard disk.  ➔ For more information on using DOS Shell, see Chapter 4, “Using the DOS Shell,” p. 57.  Figure 9.4 Changing DOS Backup’s display and mouse options.  Both programs have pull-down menus at the top of the screen. The File menu enables you to load and save setup files—files that contain all the settings you will use for a particular type of backup or restore. The File menu also enables you to print catalog files containing a list of the files that have been backed up. Both backup programs have a Help menu as well,   238  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  which explains techniques and procedures. The Windows Backup program has a third menu, a Catalog menu, which enables you to select catalog files for restoration or compari- son. This menu does not appear in the DOS version; however, you can select catalog files after you have chosen to perform a restore or compare.  Backup Types  Depending on your backup requirements, the following three specific types of backups can be performed using MSBACKUP:    A full backup copies every file on your hard disk. Keep at least two full backup sets so that you can re-create your system if your hard disk is destroyed; you need not make both copies at the same time.    An incremental backup copies only new files or files that have been changed since the last  full or incremental backup was performed. You use an additional set of disks for the incremental backup set. You might complete several backups between full backups, depending on how many files you work with and how large the files are. Each time you perform an incremental backup, you add any files that are new or have been modified since the previous new or incremental backup.    A differential backup copies only files that are new or have been changed since the last  full backup and requires a separate set of disks from the full backups. With a differential backup, however, you reuse the same floppy disks for each backup until you perform your next full backup.  The distinction between incremental and differential backups lies with the archive bit. When you perform a full backup, the backup programs turn off the archive attribute for any file that is backed up. When you modify or create a file, DOS turns on the new or modified file’s archive attribute.  When you perform an incremental backup, the backup programs turn off the archive bit  so that each incremental backup includes only files created or modified since the previous incremental backup. When you perform a differential backup, however, the backup pro- grams do not turn off the archive bit. Therefore, every file modified or created since the previous full backup is copied. The differential backup is appropriate if you work with the same few files daily and do not need several generations of each file.  You can perform a full backup weekly, monthly, or at some other interval. The intervening  incremental or differential  backup intervals reduce your risk of data loss between full back- ups. The time between performing intermediate backups depends on the amount of risk to your data you are willing to take. In a business setting, you might reduce your risk to an acceptable level by performing an intermediate backup every other day. If your PC activity level is high, you might have to perform an incremental backup daily. If your PC activity is minimal, a differential backup once every two weeks might be frequent enough to reduce your risk to a manageable level.   Using Microsoft Backup  239  Part II Ch 9  In addition to these three types of backups, you can create backup sets for special purposes. You can select files to include in, or exclude from, the backup. You can select these files indi- vidually, by directory, according to a wildcard pattern, by date, or by attribute, and save the selections in a setup file. You learn how to select files for backups later in this chapter.  Issuing the MSBACKUP Command  The syntax for the MSBACKUP command is shown in the following line: MSBACKUP filename  video  Both switches are optional. filename is the name of a setup file. If you created setup files for different types of backups, you can load one automatically by specifying the file on the com- mand line. If you do not specify a setup file, MSBACKUP loads DEFAULT.SET and applies the set- tings to the drive specified in that file. If no drive is specified, MSBACKUP applies the settings to the default drive.   video specifies the type of video display to be used. Use  LCD for laptops or other LCD screens,  BW for black and white, or  MDA for monochrome displays, including those attached to Hercules-type adapters. Do not specify a video type for a color display.  By default, MSBACKUP uses the path contained in the MSDOSDATA environment variable to determine where to look for configuration information. If this environment variable does not exist, the program searches the directory from which MSBACKUP was started. If it is not located there, MSBACKUP uses default values and creates a configuration information file in that directory. To add this environment variable, add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file: SET MSDOSDATA=C:\DOS  You can change the path to the right of the equal sign to any other valid directory you want to use for your backup configuration information.  Using Microsoft Backup  Now that you understand how Microsoft Backup  MSBACKUP.EXE  and Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x  MWBACKUP.EXE  work, it is time to see how to use them to perform your backup procedures. The following sections explain how to perform these tasks.  Performing a Full Backup  In this section, you learn how to complete a full backup. First, you learn how to use  MSBACKUP and then Microsoft Backup for Windows.  Performing a Full Backup with MSBACKUP To perform a full backup in DOS, follow these steps:  1. Enter the following command:  MSBACKUP   240  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  The program scans drive C  unless you specified a different drive and saved the infor- mation in the default setup file, DEFAULT.SET , reads its directories, and then presents its opening screen.  2. Choose the Backup button. As shown in Figure 9.5, the default setup file is loaded, and  the selected backup type is Full. To perform a full backup, select the drive to back up from the Backup From list by double-clicking the appropriate drive, or by using the cursor-movement keys to move the highlight to the drive and pressing the spacebar. You might choose more than one drive. Each time you choose a drive, Backup scans  the drive and adds the selected files to the totals.  Figure 9.5 The Backup screen.  As you select files to back up, the Backup screen shows you exactly what is required.  A message similar to this one appears: 1,316 files  with catalog  selected for backup 24 1.44 MB 3.5” floppies needed  maximum  15 min, 50 sec estimated backup time  Backup formats any target disks that are not formatted and compresses the data on the backup disks so that the capacity of the disks required might be less than the amount of data you need to back up.  The Windows Backup program indicates how many bytes of data are selected for backup and compresses the files so that fewer backup disks and less time are required to complete a backup.  3. Choose Start Backup. The program begins by creating a backup catalog, listing the files  to be backed up and the options chosen. The following message appears: Insert diskette 1 in drive A: As the backup progresses, a display similar to Figure 9.6 appears.  4. When the disk is full, the program prompts you to insert the next disk, and so on until  the backup is complete.   Figure 9.6 Viewing the progress of a backup.  Using Microsoft Backup  241  Part II Ch 9  As you remove each disk, label it “Full Backup nn,” in which nn is the number of the disk in the series. Date the label, also. When the backup is complete, the opening screen reap- pears.  Comparing the Backup to the Original Files The first time you use a series of disks for a backup, compare the backups to the originals to verify that the disks are readable and accurate. You don’t want to discover that your backup is unusable when you want to use it to recover a hard disk!  To perform a compare, follow these steps:  1. Choose Compare. A screen similar to the main Backup screen appears. 2. Choose Backup Set Catalog, and select the setup file you used for the backup.  If you  haven’t saved any setup files, it will be DEFAULT.SET.   3. Select the drive or drives from the Compare From list; the number of files to compare  changes from 0 to the number of files you backed up.  4. The program prompts you to insert each disk in turn, and a progress screen keeps you  apprised of events.  At the end of the process, the dialog box indicating that no errors were found or that the errors were corrected will probably appear. If this is not the case, you might want to discard the disks that contain the errors, replace them with new ones, and repeat the backup.  When you quit the program, you might be told that you have not saved your changes in the DEFAULT.SET setup file. In this case, you are asked whether you want to save your changes or discard them. You might find it more helpful to save your settings explicitly to other files that you can load either from within the program or from the command line. To save a backup setup, choose Save As from the File menu, and specify a filename and, optionally, a drive and directory where the setup file should be stored. The program automatically supplies the extension .SET.   242  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  Performing a Full Backup in Windows 3.x The procedure for performing a full backup in Windows is essentially the same as for DOS. The primary difference is the appearance of the screen. When the program loads, you see a message warning you not to use your disk drives while a backup, restore, or compare opera- tion is in progress. You can prevent this message from reappearing each time you load the program by checking the Disable This Message box. Otherwise, you proceed the same way you would in DOS. You can work in other programs while the backup is proceeding. A beep informs you when you must change disks.  Performing Intermediate Backups  Two types of intermediate backups are possible: incremental and differential. The difference depends on the status of the archive bit for selecting files. The incremental backup resets the archive bit after completion, and the differential backup does not reset it.  Performing an Incremental Backup To perform an incremental backup, choose Backup Type and then choose Incremental from the dialog box. The backup proceeds in the same way as the full backup. Mark each disk in the set with the number and date belonging to the increment for this backup.  You might perform an incremental backup every Tuesday and Friday, for example, and run a full backup every two weeks. Under this plan, you accumulate four incremental backup sets before you have to repeat the backup cycle and reuse the disks.  No matter what type of backup you perform, the backup programs erase the target disks; therefore, each incremental backup must start on a new target disk. You cannot add back- up files to disks that have been used as part of a set. By default, the backup programs warn you when the disk you are using is part of an existing backup set and give you the options of overwriting the disk, placing a different disk in the drive, or canceling the backup.  Performing a Differential Backup If you use the differential backup method, you have just one intermediate backup set. The first time you do an intermediate backup in a backup cycle after a full backup, start with disk number 01 in your intermediate backup set. You might need more than one disk to com- plete the backup. Because the differential method does not reset the archive bit, the next intermediate backup set includes all the files included in the first intermediate backup set. Consequently, you can reuse the same backup disks for each intermediate backup set. To perform a differential backup, select Differential from the Backup Type dialog box and pro- ceed as you would with a full backup.  The differential method has the advantage of using fewer backup disks than the incremental method. On the other hand, you retain only one intermediate copy of your files that have been modified or created since the previous full backup. If you think you might need to examine successive iterations of a file, use the incremental method.   Using Microsoft Backup  243  Special-Purpose Backups  You are not limited to full and intermediate backups of entire disks. You can specify any file or group of files to be included in a backup. When you complete a project, for example, you might want to back up all the files associated with that project in a special series for archival purposes. Or you might want to back up such files daily in a series of incremental or differ- ential backups. Both backup programs provide the means to make any number of special- purpose backups.  To select a group of files for a special backup, first make sure that your backup type is Full. Otherwise, you cannot include files that do not have their archive bit set. Next, choose Select Files. The backup program scans the default  or selected  drive to see how many files and directories are on it and displays a screen similar to the DOS Shell, with drives at the top, directories at the left, and files at the right  see Figure 9.7 . The status line displays the following message: Select entire directories with right mouse button or Spacebar  Part II Ch 9  Figure 9.7 Selecting files to back up.  You also see a series of buttons at the bottom of the screen. The Shell-like window and but- tons provide two different  although complementary  ways to select files for backing up. These procedures differ somewhat in the two backup programs.  Selecting Files Manually When you choose Select Files and go to the selection screen, you see that the root directory of the current drive is highlighted. To select an entire directory, move the highlight to it; then double-click, press the spacebar, or click once with the right mouse button. A pointer appears next to the root directory, and check marks appear next to the filenames. To select only some of the files in a directory, select the files individually in the file window, or select the directory containing them and then deselect the files you want to exclude. To select or deselect a file, follow the same procedure you use to select a directory.  When only some of the files in a directory are selected, the pointer next to the directory name changes to the > symbol.   244  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  Press Alt+N to select the Include button and then choose OK. This action selects all the files in all the subdirectories of the root directory—that is, the entire drive. Choose OK; the Backup screen reappears.  You select files and directories for backup in Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x the same way as in MSBACKUP. The main difference is the manner in which selection information is dis- played. A series of symbols lets you know in detail which directories have some or all files selected and whether some or all of the selected files will be backed up.  Files might be selected and not backed up if you have chosen an intermediate type of backup, or if you have given the program explicit instructions not to back up some of the selected files, as described in the next section.  Choosing the Legend button displays the description of the symbols, as shown in Figure 9.8.  Figure 9.8 File selection legend in Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x.  Figure 9.9 The Save Setup File dialog box.  If you want to reuse the selections you have made, be sure to save the selections in a setup file; if you don’t do so, your selections are saved in the DEFAULT.SET file. To save your selec- tions in a setup file, choose Save Setup As from the File menu. The Save Setup File dialog box appears, enabling you to give the backup set a name and description  see Figure 9.9 . You can optionally choose a different drive and directory for the setup file.  The default is C:\DOS.  Figure 9.9 shows the Windows version of the dialog box, but the DOS version is similar.  The next time you want to perform a backup of this type, load the setup file. In the DOS version, you can load the setup file from the command line or by choosing Open Setup from the File menu. In the Windows version, you can load the setup file from within the program using the same command.  The Open Setup File dialog box is similar to the Save   Using Microsoft Backup  245  Part II Ch 9  Setup File dialog box.  Under some mysterious circumstances, you sometimes have to choose the appropriate drive from the Backup From list to activate your selections; usually, however, you do not.  Choosing Files Using Selection Criteria The buttons at the bottom of the file selection screen give you many ways to select files to include in or exclude from a backup. These buttons also control other aspects of the pro- gram:    Include and Exclude enable you to specify a path to include or exclude, and a filename.  The filename might include a wildcard pattern. You can optionally check a box to include all subdirectories of the specified path. In addition to selecting files to include, you might want to exclude the following types of files, even from a full backup:    Configuration files that are regenerated or updated every time you use an applica-  tions program    Backup files created by applications programs  usually having the extension .BAK,  or some other extension including the characters B and K     Temporary files  usually having the extension .TMP or an extension including the   $ sign   select files by date.    Special enables you to exclude read-only, hidden, system, or copy-protected files, or    Display enables you to determine whether the files appear in the file window sorted by name, extension, size, date, or attribute, and whether selected files appear before unse- lected files when the screen is refreshed. The Display button in Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x, in addition to the functions available in MSBACKUP, enables you to determine which of the directory data appears in the file window. You can selectively exclude the file date, file time, file size, and file attributes. You can also rearrange the display so that the directory window appears above the file window rather than to its left.  Microsoft Backup for Windows includes two other buttons:    Legend displays the Backup Selection Legend window  refer to Figure 9.8 .   Print enables you to print a list of the files selected for backup, either to the printer or to a file.  You can print the contents of the setup file from either program by choosing Print from the File menu.   Editing the Include Exclude List in MSBACKUP When you choose Include or Exclude, the dialog box contains a button labeled Edit Include Exclude List. Choosing this button produces the dialog box shown in Figure 9.10. You can select an entry to copy, delete, or edit.   246  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  Figure 9.10 The MSBACKUP Edit Include Exclude List.  To edit a selection, choose Edit. This command displays the Edit dialog box  see Figure 9.11 . In this dialog box, you can specify a drive, path, and filename, including wildcard pat- terns. You can choose whether to include or exclude the specified files and whether to apply the selection to subdirectories of the current directory.  Figure 9.11 Editing file specifica- tions.  To use the Edit dialog box effectively, you first must copy an existing specification in the Edit Include Exclude List dialog box  refer to Figure 9.10 . Then select one of the copies and choose Edit. After you reach the Edit dialog box, you can enter any specifications you want.  In MSBACKUP, you need not include a drive name in a specification for inclusion or exclu- sion. By not specifying a drive name, you can apply the same specifications to any or all drives and select the drives from the Backup From list. In Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x, you must include a drive name. However, you can load a setup file created by MSBACKUP in Microsoft Backup for Windows.  Editing the Include Exclude List in Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x In Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x, a single dialog box contains the list of included and excluded file specifications and the fields for editing specifications  see Figure 9.12 . You do not have to edit existing specifications. You can just enter your criteria  which must include a drive name  and choose Add.   Using Microsoft Backup  247  Part II Ch 9  Figure 9.12 Including and exclud- ing files in Microsoft Backup for Windows.  Figure 9.13 The Backup Options dialog box.  Using Other Backup Options  Both backup programs give you additional options concerning their behavior. To view or change these options, use the Options button on the Backup screen. Figure 9.13 shows the resulting dialog box in Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x, with the default options select- ed. The options—and the defaults—are the same in MSBACKUP.  The Backup Options dialog box contains the following options:    Verify Backup Data forces the backup program to read the file from the backup disk  after it is written and compare it to the original file. This process ensures that the back- up is safe and accurate. When you use this option, however, the backup takes nearly twice as long.    Compress Backup Data causes the program to compress the data before writing it to  the backup disk. Compression results in the backup requiring fewer disks and might reduce the time required.    Prompt Before Overwriting Used Diskettes causes the program to display a warn-  ing before writing backup data on a used disk. You can then choose to overwrite the files on the backup disk or use a different disk.    Always Format Diskettes forces the program to format every backup disk before writ- ing to it so that the backup programs always format an unformatted disk or a badly for- matted disk. Choosing this option increases the time required for a backup.    Use Error Correction adds special coding to each backup disk to make recovering the data easier if the backup disks become damaged or worn out. This option decreases the amount of data you can fit on each backup disk, but the extra margin of safety is worth the loss.   248  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data    Keep Old Backup Catalogs prevents the programs from erasing the previous catalog  when you perform a full backup. If, as suggested, you have two separate full backup series, leave this option selected so that you can use the catalogs to locate files to be restored.    Audible Prompts  Beep  causes the computer to beep every time a prompt appears.   Quit After Backup automatically closes the program when your backup procedure is  complete. This option is useful when you are running MSBACKUP from a batch file or running Microsoft Backup for Windows in the background.    Password Protection enables you to enter a password, which will thereafter be  required to access the backup data or catalog.  Restoring Backup Files  Performing a backup operation is akin to buying an insurance policy. You hope you never have to use it, but if disaster strikes, you have a way to replace the loss. To reinstate lost data onto your hard disk, choose the Restore button in either program.  The DOS backup programs can restore only data backed up with one of these programs  or with one of the Norton backup programs, published by Symantec Corporation. DOS includes an external RESTORE command, which is the only command that can read files copied to a backup set by the BACKUP command from earlier versions of DOS. Consult the “Command Reference” later in this book for details on the use of this command.  The Restore option enables you to restore an individual file, selected files, or an entire hard disk.  Both backup programs provide the same facilities when restoring files, but they’re arranged somewhat differently. When you choose Restore, the program loads the most recent backup set catalog and displays the Restore screen shown in Figure 9.14. The catalog’s name appears in the Backup Set Catalog field. The drive and capacity used for the backup appear in the Restore From field, and Original Locations appears in the Restore To field.  Figure 9.14 The Restore screen.   Using Microsoft Backup  249  Part II Ch 9  To choose another backup set for restore, select Backup Set Catalog and choose one of the other files listed. If the file is not in the default catalog directory  C:\DOS , choose Catalog and then choose Load; then select the drive and directory from the appropriate list before choosing the catalog file.  If your hard disk contains no catalog file for the backup series from which you want to restore, choose Catalog and then Retrieve. The program asks you to place the last disk of the backup series in your drive, and the backup program reads the catalog from the disk. If the program cannot read the catalog, the catalog is missing, or the disk is damaged, choose Catalog and then Rebuild. The program asks you to insert each backup disk from the series beginning with disk 01. The backup program reconstructs the catalog from the data on the backup disks.  The Catalog command appears on a button in MSBACKUP and on the menu bar in Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x.  By default, the programs restore files to their original locations. If the file’s original directo- ry is no longer on the destination disk, the program creates the directory before restoring the file. The programs make directory entries for files that are no longer on the destination disk and allocate the next available space in the FAT for the restored file’s allocation.  You can restore to other drives or other directories. To do so, choose Restore To, and select Other Drives or Other Directories. You might want to use this option to restore an older version of a file without destroying your current version. By default, the programs automati- cally overwrite existing files of the same name in the same location. If you choose either of the alternative locations, you have a chance to enter both a drive name and directory path after you begin the restore.  You can restore all or only some of the files in a backup set. To restore all the files, select the drive or drives in the Restore Files list. This action selects all the files in the backup set that were originally on the selected drive.  To select individual files to restore, choose Select Files. You again see a screen similar to the DOS Shell screen. However, only those drives included in the backup appear on the drive bar, and no filenames appear in the file window if the current directory did not include any files that were backed up. In Microsoft Backup for Windows 3.x, directories that contain no files in the backup set appear in light gray. You select files and directories to restore in the same way you selected files and directories for backup.  When the correct entries appear in all fields of the Restore screen, choose Start Restore. Like the Backup module, the Restore module prompts you for the disks of the backup set.  Restoring a full backup set to a freshly formatted disk eliminates any file fragmentation that might have existed on the disk when you backed up the files. Restoring an incremental backup set, however, might result in fragmented destination files. As you might recall, frag- mentation doesn’t affect the file’s integrity, but it might slow disk performance slightly.   250  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  When you restore files, keep the following guidelines in mind:    The destination disk must already be formatted. The restore operation, unlike the back-  up operation, has no provision to format the destination disk.   Files restored to a freshly formatted disk are not fragmented.  Restoring Files After a Disk Failure This section presents an example of restoring files. Assume that you are using a backup poli- cy that includes a weekly full backup on Friday and an incremental backup each Wednesday. You have two backup sets. The first set from Friday contains all files. The second set con- tains only files modified or created after Friday, but before Thursday.  If you have copy-protected files on your hard disk when you do a backup, they might not restore properly to a destination disk. Ideally, you uninstall copy-protected software using the manufacturer’s suggested procedure before you perform the backup; then you reinstall the copy-protected programs after the restore operation. This practice might not be practi- cal, however. Keep in mind that you might have to reinstall copy-protected software after restoring a complete disk.  Now suppose that you are saving a worksheet file on Thursday morning when a worker begins to use a large drill next door. DOS reports the following message: General Failure on drive C:  You abort the spreadsheet session and run CHKDSK or SCANDISK to ensure that your FAT and directory system are in order.  Chapter 7, “Preparing and Maintaining Disks,” covers the operation of both CHKDSK and SCANDISK.  DOS reports hundreds of lost clusters.  You have had an electrical noise–induced hard disk failure. You have no choice but to refor- mat your hard disk and then fall back to your backup disks. This process requires the steps discussed in the following paragraphs.  You first have to reboot your computer with a DOS startup disk in drive A because the DOS utilities on your hard disk might be corrupt. After you format your hard disk, copy the external DOS commands back to the hard disk from the DOS master disks. You must use MSBACKUP for the restore because you have not yet restored Windows. Use the PATH com- mand to set a search path to the DOS directory so that DOS can locate the MSBACKUP com- mand.  In case of total disk failure, restore your backup sets in chronological order. Restore your latest full backup set first. Locate the disks from your full backup set and put them in their proper order. Then, issue the MSBACKUP command. You probably will have to configure the program all over again. After you have completed this process, choose Restore.  Put the last disk into drive A, and choose Catalog and then Retrieve. Select the appropriate drive or drives in the Restore Files list. Choose Start Restore.   Using Microsoft Backup  251  DOS lists the full path and filenames of the files being restored on the progress screen. When all the files from the first disk are restored to the hard disk, DOS prompts you for the next disk in the backup set. This cycle repeats until you have completed the restore operation.  After restoring the full backup set, you must restore the incremental backup set. Because you want to restore all the files in the incremental backup set, you use the same procedures you used to restore the full backup set. The operation proceeds in the same fashion.  After both backup sets are restored, run CHKDSK or SCANDISK to ensure that the hard disk is  in order. Keep both backup sets intact until you have determined that your hard disk is per- forming correctly. Run CHKDSK or SCANDISK several times during the day. If all is in order, perform a full backup at the end of the day.  Part II Ch 9  Performing a Selective Restore This section discusses how to perform a selective restore operation. Assume that last week you accidentally deleted the database file CLIENT.DB from your INVOICES directory. You dis- covered the error today and have already tried, unsuccessfully, to use the UNDELETE command. Luckily, an up-to-date version of the CLIENT.DB file is on your most recent backup set.  To restore only the \BUSINESS\INVOICES\CLIENT.DB file from the backup set, load the backup program you use, choose Restore, select the appropriate backup set, and choose Select Files.  You again see a tree and file window, as shown in Figure 9.15. Select the file from the file window.  Figure 9.15 Selecting a file to restore.  As in the complete restore example, RESTORE prompts you to insert the first disk. You can insert the first disk, or if you know the disk number that holds the CLIENT.DB file, you  can insert that disk. RESTORE bypasses any files on the source disk that are not included in the destination parameter you gave in the command. When RESTORE encounters the file \BUSINESS\INVOICES\CLIENT.DB, the program lists the filename on the progress screen and copies the file to the destination disk.   252  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  Understanding Computer Viruses  In working with computers, you probably have encountered situations in which the comput- er didn’t do what you wanted it to do. Frustrating as these situations can be, they simply represent a misunderstanding between you and your computer.  Computer viruses are quite different; viruses are supposed to do harm to your computer. Viruses are programs, written by unscrupulous programmers, designed to make copies of themselves and spread from one computer to another, just as a biological virus spreads in people. Usually, viruses also damage your computer by destroying legitimate data and pro- grams. Creating a virus is against the law, but depraved programmers still spread viruses for the same reason that vandals throw bricks through windows—to cause senseless damage.  To protect yourself, you must understand how viruses work. The following sections explain computer viruses in detail.  Understanding How Viruses Spread  Computer viruses come in thousands of variations, each of which works a little differently. How viruses spread from one computer to another, and the damage they do, depends on how the virus is written.  A virus begins in the hands of an experienced but morally corrupt programmer who is either malicious or insensitive to the damage caused. The programmer usually starts with an exist- ing program  anything from a game to a word processing program  and adds a few carefully crafted instructions that modify the workings of the program. This person then distributes the altered program to other users, either on a floppy disk or through an electronic bulletin board.  When the unsuspecting recipient runs the altered software, the program might appear to work correctly, but the added code—the virus—performs some type of operation that the victim doesn’t want. This operation might delete important files or erase the hard disk entirely. The virus also might display a taunting message. The most dangerous viruses, how- ever, do no immediate damage; they might alter the operating system by planting a kind of time bomb. Days, weeks, or months after the original infected program ran, the operating system might suddenly go wild, deleting files and destroying data.  Worse, most viruses are designed to spread to other computers. Between the time when a virus infects a computer and the time when it begins to damage that computer, the virus might copy itself onto every floppy that the victim inserts into the computer. Because the victim is unaware that the computer is infected until the virus begins to do damage, he or she might unwittingly spread hundreds of copies to friends.  Strange as it might seem, more than 10,000 viruses exist today. You should be concerned about computer viruses, and you should be serious about protecting your system. However, you might derive some comfort from knowing that your computer can become infected in only one of two ways:   Understanding Computer Viruses  253    Loading and running infected software. Your chance of infecting your computer  decreases greatly if you get software only from reputable software companies. When you load software from bulletin boards or from an illegal source, your chances of encountering a virus increase.    Booting from an infected floppy disk. Many viruses spread when a computer boots from a floppy disk that carries the virus. Beware of disks that weren’t formatted by you or by someone you trust.  Fighting Viruses with Microsoft Anti-Virus  Your best defense against viruses is a virus-scanning program. Such a program can scan files and disks, looking for telltale sequences of instructions that have been identified as parts of known viruses. Used correctly, a good virus program can protect you against the vast major- ity of known viruses before they damage your computer.  DOS includes two programs—Microsoft Anti-Virus  MSAV  and Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows  MWAV —that can scan your memory and disk for hundreds of known viruses. You can use these programs to detect and destroy viruses.  Part II Ch 9  Windows 9x and the accompanying version of DOS no longer include the Microsoft  Anti-Virus program. I recommend that you purchase a third-party application, such  as Symantec’s Norton Antivirus. You can find more information about it at http:  www.symantec.com .  Although the Microsoft Anti-Virus program is included with DOS 6.22, I highly recommend- ed that you use a new third-party program that has updated signature files for all the new viruses that are cropping up every day.  In its simplest use, you can start MSAV simply by typing MSAV at the DOS prompt. You can select the functions you want to perform from MSAV’s menu. Figure 9.16 shows the main MSAV menu.  Figure 9.16 The Microsoft Anti- Virus main menu.   254  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  The following list describes the options in this menu:    Detect looks for viruses and tells you what it finds, but it does not destroy viruses.   Detect & Clean looks for viruses and destroys any it finds.   Select New Drive enables you to specify the drive on which Detect or Detect & Clean  runs.    Options enables you to configure various options that determine how MSAV works.   Exit terminates MSAV.  The most common operation you will perform is scanning for viruses. To scan the currently logged drive for viruses, select Detect  or press F4 . MSAV scans the current drive for virus- es and reports on how many files it searched and how many viruses it found  none, you hope . Figure 9.17 shows a sample report after MSAV has done its work.  Figure 9.17 Typical MSAV report after a virus scan is completed.  With luck, you will never face the unpleasant prospect of finding a virus on your system. However, if MSAV finds a virus during its scan, it displays a dialog box telling you which virus it found and which file contained the virus, and asking what you want to do. If you select Continue, MSAV keeps looking for more viruses. If you select Clean, MSAV destroys the virus and then continues searching.  If you want to tell MSAV to scan your disk and clean any viruses it finds, select Detect & Clean. MSAV cleans any viruses it finds.  If you want to scan a different drive, choose Select New Drive  or press F2  and select the drive you want to scan.  The complete command-line syntax of the DOS version of Microsoft Anti-Virus is shown here: MSAV drive:  S  C  R  A  L  N  P  F videoswitches  VIDEO  If you specify the drive parameter, MSAV scans the indicated drive; otherwise, it scans the currently logged drive.  The  S switch tells MSAV to immediately invoke the Detect function, causing it to scan the specified drive. However, with this option, MSAV doesn’t remove any viruses it finds. The  C switch tells it to scan and remove the viruses it finds.   Understanding Computer Viruses  255  The  R switch tells MSAV to create a scan report. MSAV creates a file called MSAV.RPT, which lists the number of files MSAV scanned, the number of viruses detected, and the number of viruses removed. MSAV.RPT is always created in the drive’s root directory.  The  A switch causes MSAV to scan all drives except A and B. The  L switch causes MSAV to scan all hard disks on your computer, but not drives on a network.  The  N switch causes MSAV to run without using the graphical user interface. If it detects a virus, it returns a special exit code  86 . This switch is useful when you’re scanning for virus- es within a batch file.  The  P switch runs MSAV with a command-line interface rather than a graphical user inter- face. Normally, MSAV displays filenames as it scans. The  F switch tells MSAV not to dis- play filenames. Use this switch only with the  N or  P switch.  Part II Ch 9  MSAV also recognizes many switches that control how it uses the screen. These switches are shown in Table 9.2. You can use the  VIDEO switch to display all these options.  Table 9.2 MSAV Options for Controlling Display  Meaning Sets the screen to 25 lines  default   Sets the screen to 28 lines  VGA only   Sets the screen to 43 lines  EGA or VGA   Sets the screen to 50 lines  VGA only   Sets the screen to 60 lines  Video 7 display adapters only   Uses the computer’s BIOS for video display  Enables a graphics mouse in Windows  Uses a black-and-white scheme  Uses screen updating that works especially fast on CGA displays  Uses a color scheme  Uses a scheme that works well on LCD screens  Reverses left and right mouse buttons  Uses a monochromatic color scheme  Disables alternative fonts  Uses the default mouse character rather than the graphics mouse pointer  Resets the mouse if the mouse pointer disappears  Understanding Checklists After you have used MSAV to scan a drive, you might notice that each directory contains a file called CHKLIST.MS. This file contains identifying information  called checksums  about the  Switch   25   28   43   50   60   BF   BT   BW   FF   IN   LCD   LE   MONO   NF   NGM   PS2   256  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  files in that directory. Each time MSAV scans the files in that directory again, it can com- pare the current status of the file against information in the CHKLIST.MS file. If a file has become infected since the CHKLIST.MS file was created, the checksums indicate that a change has occurred.  The CHKLIST.MS files don’t require much disk space, but if you want to free some disk space, you can start MSAV and press F7 to tell MSAV to delete all CHKLIST.MS files.  If you don’t want MSAV to create CHKLIST.MS files in the future, start MSAV and select Options  or press F8 , and turn off Create New Checksums.  Listing Viruses If you are interested in learning about the viruses known to MSAV, you can use MSAV’s List feature to access its list of viruses. Start MSAV and press F9 to see MSAV’s virus list.  You can use the scrollbars to scan through the list of known viruses, or you can search for a particular virus by entering its name in the blue box and selecting Find Next.  When you find a virus about which you would like more information, click the virus’s name. MSAV displays information about the virus, such as the sample shown in Figure 9.18.  Figure 9.18 Sample information about a virus.  Figure 9.19 Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows main dialog box.  Using the Windows Version of Microsoft Anti-Virus  The Windows version of Microsoft Anti-Virus, MWAV, is almost identical in its operation to the DOS version. When you invoke MWAV, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 9.19. Select the drive you want to scan, and then click Detect to scan without removing viruses, or Detect and Clean to scan for viruses and remove any viruses found.   Unformatting a Disk  257  By selecting the Scan menu, you can access most of the other options described with MSAV in the preceding section. This menu includes Delete CHKLIST Files, which deletes all the CHKLIST.MS files on your disk, and Virus List, which enables you to access MWAV’s virus list.  Guarding Against Infection  Most users can protect themselves against viruses by following these steps:  1. Before you load any software from floppy disks, scan all the disks with MSAV or  MWAV. Click Select New Drive, select your floppy disk drive, and execute Detect for each disk.  2. After you install new software and before you run it, run MSAV or MWAV on your  3. If you download software from bulletin boards, run MSAV or MWAV on your hard disk  hard disk.  before you run that software.  4. Never boot from a floppy disk that you have not scanned for viruses  with MSAV or  MWAV  or that you did not format yourself.  Part II Ch 9  Unformatting a Disk  Sooner or later, virtually all PC users format a disk accidentally. The UNFORMAT command provides you with your best chance to undo the damage. UNFORMAT is designed to restore the previous format of hard and floppy disks. It also can help you recover from accidental change or damage to a hard disk’s partition table.  UNFORMAT is one of those DOS commands that was originally part of commercial products. Microsoft has licensed the code for the UNFORMAT command from Central Point Software. UNFORMAT came to the DOS package from Central Point’s PC Tools.  UNFORMAT has two primary uses:    To recover files after an accidental format   To rebuild a damaged partition table on your hard disk  Because UNFORMAT completely rebuilds a disk’s FAT, root directory, and boot record, you should use this command only as a last resort. The degree of success you have in recovering all files depends on which version of DOS you used to format the disk, what switches you used, and what you have done to the disk since you reformatted it.  If the disk that you accidentally formatted is a hard disk, do not install DOS on it because the DOS files will overwrite files you want to recover. Do not copy or save files of any kind to the reformatted hard disk. If you have to reboot the computer, use a bootable floppy disk.   258  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  The FORMAT command creates a MIRROR image file during the safe format procedure. The MIRROR image file contains a copy of the disk’s FAT, root directory, and boot record. It saves this information in a normally unused portion of the disk. At the same time, FORMAT creates a hidden file named MIRORSAV.FIL, which contains information required by DOS to locate the MIRROR image file. The MIRORSAV.FIL file is given the hidden attribute, so  it is not “visible” by the DIR command unless you use the  AH switch. If you use the  U switch with FORMAT, however, no MIRROR image file is created, and UNFORMAT does not work.  When you want to use UNFORMAT after an accidental format, use the following syntax: UNFORMAT d:  J  L  P  TEST  U  d: is the drive that contains the disk to be unformatted.   J causes UNFORMAT to verify that the MIRROR image file accurately reflects the current disk information.   L searches a formatted disk and lists the file and directory names found.   P sends all output to a printer.   TEST provides a test run to indicate whether UNFORMAT can unformat a disk successfully.   U attempts to unformat a disk without the benefit of a MIRROR image file.  When you want to use UNFORMAT to rebuild a hard disk partition table, use the following  syntax: UNFORMAT  PARTN  L  P   PARTN causes the command to try to rebuild the hard disk partition tables.   L displays the current partition table.   P sends all output to a printer.  Recovering from an Accidental Format  Suppose that you just accidentally formatted a hard disk  or used the DOS RECOVER com- mand incorrectly—see Appendix F, “Command Reference,” for a discussion of RECOVER . In this case, you need to use UNFORMAT, which uses the information stored in the MIRROR image file to restore the FAT, root directory, and boot record to their preformatting condition.  To unformat a disk that was safe-formatted, type the following command at the DOS prompt: UNFORMAT d:   Remember to replace the d: with the letter of the drive that contains the disk you want to unformat.  UNFORMAT first tells you to insert a disk into the specified drive and press Enter.   Unformatting a Disk  259  Part II Ch 9  When you follow these instructions, the computer beeps and displays a screen similar to this: Restores the system area of your disk with the image file created by MIRROR  WARNING!            WARNING!  This should be used ONLY to recover from the inadvertent use of the DOS FORMAT command or the DOS RECOVER command. Any other use of UNFORMAT may cause you to lose data! Files modified since the MIRROR file was created may be lost.  As you can see, UNFORMAT first tries to scare you by giving you messages such as WARNING! Then, it settles down and searches the disk for the MIRROR file created the last time the disk was formatted. It then displays a message similar to the following: The last time MIRROR was used was at hh:mm on mm-dd-yy.  For the hh:mm and mm-dd-yy information in this message, UNFORMAT substitutes the time and date at which MIRROR.FIL was created. UNFORMAT again causes your computer to beep and then displays the following message, substituting the correct drive letter for d: The MIRROR image file has been validated.  Are you SURE you want to update the SYSTEM area of your drive d  Y N ?  If you choose to use the MIRROR information, UNFORMAT restores the FAT, root directory, and boot record stored in the MIRROR file. Unfortunately, UNFORMAT might have problems fully restoring fragmented files. If UNFORMAT cannot restore a file due to fragmentation, it displays a prompt asking whether you want the file erased or truncated. This incapability to deal with file fragmentation severely limits the usefulness of UNFORMAT. Hard disks begin to frag- ment files from the first day you start using them.  Don’t think of the UNFORMAT command as a magic bullet that will keep you and your disks from peril. Rather, think of it as a last-ditch chance to save you from a mistake that has only a 50 50 chance of being totally successful. Nothing will save you from data losses better than a rigorously applied system of disk backups.  Recovering from an Accidental Format Without a MIRROR Image File  Even if a MIRROR image file is not available for a formatted disk, the UNFORMAT command might be able to recover most of the data. This process takes more time than if a MIRROR image file were available, however, and it does not recover files that were in the disk’s root directory.  To use UNFORMAT to unformat a hard disk on which no current MIRROR image file exists, use the following syntax: UNFORMAT d:  U  L  TEST  P  Replace d: with the letter of the drive that contains the accidentally formatted disk.   260  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  The  U switch stands for “unformat” and tells UNFORMAT that you are not using a MIRROR image file created by FORMAT.  The optional  L parameter causes UNFORMAT to list all files and directories found during the UNFORMAT operation. Similarly,  P causes UNFORMAT to send the entire UNFORMAT process to your printer.  Use the  TEST option to run a simulation of the process so that you can see which files UNFORMAT can recover before any changes are written to the hard disk.  After you execute the command, UNFORMAT displays the following message: CAUTION !!  This attempts to recover all files lost after a FORMAT, assuming you’ve NOT been using MIRROR. This method cannot guarantee complete recovery of your files.  The search-phase is safe: nothing is altered on the disk. You will be prompted again before changes are written to the disk. Using drive d: Are you SURE you want to do this? If so, type Y; to cancel the operation, press any other key.  To continue with the unformat operation, press Y and then press Enter. Press any other key to cancel the process. While searching the disk, UNFORMAT displays the following message: Searching disk pp% searched, mm subdirectories found. Files found in the root: 0 Subdirectories found in the root: mm  UNFORMAT does not find any root-level files, but it substitutes for mm the number of root-level subdirectories it finds.  Refer to Chapter 5, “Understanding Files and Directories,” for a discussion of files and the root directory.  As UNFORMAT searches the disk, the command con- tinually updates the last message, substituting the percentage of the disk read for pp and the number of subdirectories found for mm.  After UNFORMAT completes its search of the disk’s data, the command lists the subdirectories found. Depending on which version of the FORMAT command you used, UNFORMAT might or might not be able to recover the names of subdirectories. If it cannot, UNFORMAT gives each subdirectory a name in the format SUBDIR.nnn, with nnn representing a number ranging from 1 to 512. If UNFORMAT can find the subdirectory names, it displays them and then dis- plays a message similar to this one: Walking the directory tree to locate all files_  Path=D:\ Path=D:\DIRNAME\ Path=D:\   Unformatting a Disk  261  In this message, D is the drive name, and DIRNAME is the subdirectory name. This message is repeated for each subdirectory found. UNFORMAT then lists the number of files found, includ- ing subdirectories, and displays the following warning: Files found: nn Warning!  The next step writes changes to disk. Are you sure you want to do this?  If so, type Y; to cancel the operation, press any other key.  To proceed with the unformat operation, press Y and then Enter. Again, UNFORMAT has prob- lems dealing with fragmented files, so you have to decide whether to truncate or delete frag- mented files.  Part II Ch 9  Rebuilding a Partition Table  UNFORMAT also enables you to recover from a corrupted hard disk partition table. Such an error normally generates this DOS message: Invalid drive specification  To recover from this problem, you first must issue the UNFORMAT command with the  PARTN switch and then use UNFORMAT without this parameter to restore the FAT, root directory, and boot sector.  To recover from a corrupted hard disk partition table, follow these steps:  1. Boot your computer  with a floppy disk, if necessary  and display the DOS prompt. 2. Change to a drive that contains the UNFORMAT file, UNFORMAT.COM. If your only hard disk  is inaccessible because of partition-table corruption, use a copy of DOS on a floppy disk.  You can find UNFORMAT.COM on the startup disk, one of the disks used during DOS installation.   3. Type the following command at the DOS prompt:  UNFORMAT  PARTN UNFORMAT prompts you to insert the disk containing the file PARTNSAV.FIL and to type the name of that disk drive.  4. Insert the disk that contains the copy of the partition table created by MIRROR. 5. Type the letter of this drive and press Enter. MIRROR rebuilds the partition table from the file PARTNSAV.FIL found on the floppy disk. After UNFORMAT rebuilds the partition table, the program prompts you to insert a master DOS disk into drive A and press Enter. To complete this process, you need a bootable backup disk that contains your system files and the UNFORMAT command.  6. Insert a bootable DOS disk into drive A and then press Enter. UNFORMAT causes your  computer to reboot.  7. Use the copy of UNFORMAT on the floppy to restore the FAT, root directory, and boot  record, following the steps described in “Recovering from an Accidental Format” earlier in this chapter.   262  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  Recovering Deleted Files with UNDELETE  Because of the way DOS deletes files, reversing the process is relatively easy, but only if you act promptly. When DOS deletes a file, it changes the first character in the filename record- ed in the directory area of the disk so that the target file no longer is listed. As far as DOS is concerned, the file is gone. DOS does not erase the filename entry completely, or overwrite any data in the file, until it needs the space for another file.  Eventually, as you add new files to the disk, DOS reallocates the disk space assigned to the deleted file, causing new data to overwrite the old data. Soon, the file and its data are gone permanently. But if you use the UNDELETE command before DOS has a chance to overwrite  a deleted file’s data, you can reverse the DELETE operation.  If you discover that you accidentally deleted a file, immediately try to recover it. The longer you wait, the less likely you are to recover the file completely by using the UNDELETE com- mand.  Using UNDELETE from the Command Line  UNDELETE provides three levels of protection against losing accidentally deleted files: delete sentry, delete tracking, and standard. Both the delete sentry and delete tracker options require you to load the memory-resident portion of UNDELETE, which requires just over 13KB of memory.  Delete sentry gives you the highest level of protection by creating a hidden subdirectory called SENTRY. As files are deleted, the memory-resident portion of UNDELETE moves copies of the files into this directory without changing the FAT entry for the file. UNDELETE regulates the amount of disk space that can be taken up by files stored in the SENTRY directory to about 7% of the disk’s total space. As files are deleted and the SENTRY directory fills up, the oldest files in the directory are deleted for real to make room for recent additions.  Delete tracker’s protection is one step down from the sentry. It uses a hidden file named PCTRACKER.DEL to record information about deleted files. When files are deleted, the delete tracker feature releases the file’s FAT entry, making the disk space available to another file. You can undelete the file as long as no other file has been written to that location. Using delete tracker makes undelete operations easier because it stores the file’s original names but does nothing to protect the file’s location on the disk from being overwritten. Delete track- er, however, uses much less disk space.  The standard level of protection depends on a deleted file’s directory entry and disk location remaining intact. If neither location has been overwritten, the standard undelete protection simply restores the directory entry as being no longer deleted. Despite the standard method’s relative lack of protection, most DOS users rely on the standard method because memory is not lost due to loading the memory-resident version of UNDELETE, and disk space is not used to store deleted files or information about deleted files.   Recovering Deleted Files with UNDELETE  263  Part II Ch 9  The UNDELETE command has the following two syntactical forms: UNDELETE FileNameExpression  DS DT DOS  UNDELETE  LIST ALL PURGE[drive] STATUS LOAD UNLOAD  S[drive] Tdrive[-entries]]  The FileNameExpression of the first form specifies the file or files to be undeleted. You can use wildcards to indicate multiple files. By default, if you do not specify a filename, DOS attempts to undelete all deleted files in the current directory. If you do not specify a method using the three switches of the first form, DOS attempts to use delete sentry if available, then tracking if available, and then DOS standard if neither of the other methods is avail- able.  The  DS switch tells DOS to use the delete sentry method, recovering only files stored in the SENTRY directory. You are prompted to confirm undeletion of each file.  The  DT switch instructs DOS to use the delete tracking method of recovering the specified files. You are prompted to confirm undeletion of each file.   DOS causes DOS, in its attempt to undelete files, to rely on the information still stored in the DOS directory instead of using one of the other more protective methods.   LIST displays a list of the files that can be recovered without attempting to recover them.  The  ALL switch attempts to recover all deleted files without a confirmation prompt for each file. When used with this switch, UNDELETE first attempts to use the delete sentry method if available, then tries the delete tracking method, and finally if neither of these methods is available, uses information directly from the DOS directory.   LOAD causes UNDELETE to install itself in memory. If no UNDELETE.INI file is found, it is  created.   UNLOAD removes the memory-resident portion of UNDELETE from your system’s memory,  disabling the delete sentry and delete tracking methods of file recovery.   PURGE deletes the contents of the SENTRY directory on the specified drive. If no drive is specified, UNDELETE searches the current drive for the directory.   STATUS lists the type of delete protection in effect for each of the drives currently protected with sentry or tracking.   S enables delete sentry protection on the specified drives using the information found in UNDELETE.INI. If this file is not found, it is created. Normally, you establish delete sentry protection by adding a line in AUTOEXEC.BAT.   T enables the delete tracking protection on the specified drives using information from UNDELETE.INI. If this file is not found, it is created. The -entries portion of this parameter specifies the maximum number of files that can be tracked. Valid values range between 1 and 999. Normally, you establish delete tracking protection by adding a line in AUTOEXEC.BAT.   264  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  Recovering Files with UNDELETE  To install delete sentry or delete tracking, you ideally put a command line in your  AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load the UNDELETE command with its deletion tracking or delete sentry option. These options load a memory-resident portion of the regular UNDELETE command. You specify which option you want to use by including in the command-line switches that load UNDELETE as a resident program.  Suppose that you want to recover a file and have installed UNDELETE with the delete sentry option. Change to the directory that contains the deleted file and then type the following command: UNDELETE filename.ext  Be sure to substitute the name of the file that you want to recover for filename.ext. When you press Enter, DOS displays a message similar to this one: UNDELETE - A delete protection facility  Copyright  1987-1993 Central Point Software, Inc. All rights reserved.  Directory: C:\SPREADSH\QPRODAT File Specifications: filename.ext  Searching Delete Sentry control file...  Delete Sentry control file contains    1 deleted files.

Of those,       0 files have all clusters available,  0 files have some clusters available, 0 files have no clusters available.  MS-DOS directory contains    0 deleted files. Of those,        0 files may be recovered.  Using the Delete Sentry method.  Searching Delete Sentry control file.... filename.ext  4037   11-29-01    4:58p  ...A Deleted 12-5-01 1:32a  This file can be 100% undeleted. Undelete  Y N ?n  This message indicates, in place of filename.ext, the name of the file you specified. The message then indicates the total number of deleted files by this name listed in the Delete Sentry directory; the total number of files by this name in the deletion tracking file; the number of files by this name that have all clusters available and, therefore, are recoverable; the number of partially recoverable files; and the number of files that are not recoverable.  Next, the DELETE command’s message might indicate that the deleted file still is listed in the MS-DOS directory. Such a file might have been deleted when UNDELETE was not resident in memory as well as when delete tracking was active.  Finally, the UNDELETE message lists the first file matching filename.ext that DOS found in the Delete Sentry directory. If this file is recoverable  that is, if the file’s clusters have not yet   Recovering Deleted Files with UNDELETE  265  been reallocated to another file , DOS asks whether you want to undelete the file. To recov- er the file, press Y. DOS recovers the file and displays the following message: File successfully undeleted.  The UNDELETE message also lists any other files with the same name in the Delete Sentry dir- ectory. The files are listed one by one, starting with the most recently deleted files. For each file, UNDELETE asks whether you want to recover the file. If additional files with the same name are listed in the deletion tracking file, UNDELETE repeats the procedure for each of these files.  If recovering a file creates a duplicate filename in the directory, UNDELETE displays the fol- lowing message: The filename already exists. Enter a different filename.  Press “F5” to bypass this file.  If you want to recover this file, type a unique filename  one that does not already exist in the current directory . Otherwise, press F5 to skip this file.  Part II Ch 9  You might have created and deleted same-named files in a particular directory more than once.  In fact, every time you save a file on which you are working, you delete the preced- ing version and create a new one.  So, don’t be alarmed or confused if UNDELETE asks more than once whether you want to recover a particular file. Normally, you recover the most recently deleted version of the file and discard the others.  Occasionally, by the time you realize that you need to recover an accidentally deleted file, other files might have reused some of the file’s clusters. In such a case, UNDELETE displays the following message: Only some of the clusters for this file are available. Do you want to recover this file with only the available clusters?  Y N   Press Y to recover the available bytes or N to skip the file. If you wait too long before attempting to recover a file, you might not be able to recover the file because other files are using all its clusters. In this case, UNDELETE tells you so and displays this message: Press any key to continue  Sometimes, even though most of a file still is on disk, the clusters in the first part of the file might have been reused by another file. In such a case, UNDELETE loses its “map” to the rest of the file and displays the following message: Starting cluster is unavailable. This file cannot be recovered with the UNDELETE command. Press any key to continue.  If you want to know which deleted files you still can recover, type the following command: UNDELETE  LIST  UNDELETE displays, from the Delete Sentry directory, the deletion tracking file, the DOS directory, and a list of deleted files from the current directory.   266  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  If a deletion tracking list is too long to fit in one screen, you can press Ctrl+S to pause the display. Press any key on the keyboard to resume scrolling. Do not use redirection or the MORE filter; these actions create disk files that might overwrite some or all of the data that you want to recover.  If you delete all the files in a directory and then delete the directory, you cannot recover any of the deleted files from that directory. UNDELETE cannot recover a deleted directory.  The UNDELETE command is a product of Central Point Software, licensed by Microsoft Corporation for distribution as part of DOS.  Using the DOS Directory to Recover a File  If you were not using the UNDELETE command’s resident portion when you accidentally delet- ed the file that you want to recover, you can try to recover the file by using the information stored in the DOS directory. To do so, type the following command: UNDELETE filename.ext  DOS  Substitute for filename.ext the name of the file that you want to recover. UNDELETE displays a message similar to the following one: Directory: C:\SPREADSH\QPRODAT File Specifications: filename.ext  Delete Sentry Control file not found. Deletion-tracking file not found. MS-DOS Directory contains 1 deleted files. Of those,   1 files may be recovered.  Using the MS-DOS Directory.  filename  ext  Undelete  Y N ?  4037   11-29-01    4:58p   ...A  Press Y to recover the file or N to skip the file. After you press Y, UNDELETE displays the fol- lowing prompt: Enter the first character of the filename.  Because the DOS directory no longer has any record of this first character, you must supply the letter. Type the letter that you want UNDELETE to use as the beginning letter of the file- name. UNDELETE recovers the file and displays the following message: File successfully undeleted.   Using the Microsoft Undelete Program for Windows 3.x  267  Using the Microsoft Undelete Program for Windows 3.x  If you use Microsoft Windows 3.x, the DOS Setup program probably installed the Windows utilities in their own program group in the Windows Program Manager. The Windows Tools group includes an Undelete program. When you open this program, Windows dis- plays a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 9.20, listing the deleted files in whatever directory was current when you started Windows. The following sections explain how to set up and use Microsoft Undelete for Windows.  Part II Ch 9  Starting with Windows 95, Microsoft no longer includes the DOS-based UNDELETE pro- gram. Instead, it offers a new feature called the Recycle Bin, which is located on the desk- top and stores the files that are deleted until you empty it.  Because this program is GUI based, if you delete anything from a command prompt, it  is gone forever. It is recommended that any file deletion in Windows 9x be done from Explorer.  Figure 9.20 Using the Windows Undelete program.  Configuring Microsoft Undelete  If you have installed the DOS version of UNDELETE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you do not need to configure Microsoft Undelete. If you have not installed UNDELETE, however, choose Configure Delete Protection from the Options menu. This command displays a dialog box in which you can choose one of the following options:    Delete Sentry   Delete Tracker   Standard  no delete protection    268  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  You already have seen what each of these options does. If you install Delete Protection through Windows, UNDELETE is automatically installed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Selecting Files to Recover  If the default directory does not contain the file that you want to recover, click the Drive Dir button or choose Change Drive Directory from the File menu. A dialog box appears in which you can type the correct directory path in a text box or choose the directo- ry from a list box. When you click OK, the main window shows the deleted file in your cho- sen directory  refer to Figure 9.20 . When you select a file, Windows displays the following information below the directory window:    The date and time when the file was deleted, if known  this information is available  only if Delete Sentry is used     The protection method in use when the file was deleted, if any  if none, Windows dis-  plays the message Protected by: DOS     The current drive and directory   The probability that the file can be recovered  If the directory in which the deleted file was stored is not current, click the Find button or choose Find Deleted File from the File menu. The Find Deleted Files dialog box appears  see Figure 9.21 .  Figure 9.21 The Find Deleted Files dialog box.  In this dialog box, you can type the name of the file that you want to find and also some text from the file; this information helps Undelete locate the correct version of the file. If you want to narrow the search further, click the Groups button to display a list of all the file types whose extensions are associated with a program in Windows. You can narrow the search more by clicking one or more of the listed groups. After you finish specifying what to search for, click OK.  If Undelete finds any matching files, it displays the files in the directory window.   Using the Microsoft Undelete Program for Windows 3.x  269  Recovering Files  When you see the file that you want to recover, select it and then perform one of the fol- lowing actions:    Click the Undelete button.   Choose Undelete from the File menu.   Choose Undelete To from the File menu.  You can select more than one file by clicking each file or by moving the selection bar to each file and pressing the spacebar.  If you use either of the first two methods, Undelete simply recovers the file in its current location. If the prognosis for recovery is not good, however, you might want to use the Undelete To command so that you can recover the file to another drive.  You might have to search the disk to find the data that was in the file. If you’re not success- ful the first time, Undelete To enables you to try again without disturbing the data on the original disk.  If you use the Undelete command and recover the file, the information in the Condition column changes to read Recovered, as shown in Figure 9.22.  Part II Ch 9  Figure 9.22 Successfully undelet- ing files.  If you try to recover a file whose name is being used by another file, the message File already exists appears. Click OK, and you see a dialog box in which you can enter a new name for the file. As you can see in Figure 9.22, both files named BUDGET.WQ1 have been recovered, but one has been renamed.   270  Chapter 9 Protecting Your Data  Using Other Options  Microsoft Undelete includes several other options that are not available when you try to recover a deleted file from the DOS prompt:    Sorting—The Sort By button and the Sort By command  Options menu  enable you to sort the filenames displayed in the Undelete window by name, date, size, directory date and time, deletion date and time, or condition.    Printing—You can group the files in the display by directory and then print them by  clicking the Print button or choosing Print List from the File menu.    Displaying information—You can click the Info button or choose File Info from the File menu to display a box in which all the information about a deleted file is conve- niently grouped in one place.    Selecting files—The Options menu contains two commands that you can use to select  groups of files for recovery. Choose Select by Name to display a dialog box in which you enter a filename. If you include a wildcard pattern in the filename, all matching files are selected. You then can choose the Unselect by Name command to narrow the selection.    Deleting files—If you installed the delete sentry option, you can choose Purge Delete  Sentry File from the File menu to get rid of all the files—or selected files—in the Delete Sentry directory. You might want to use this command if you are running low  on disk space and need to install a new program.  Project: Developing a Backup Policy  Every PC user should develop a backup policy—a defined method of backing up data regu- larly. The policy you develop depends on different factors. As you learned earlier in this chapter, you can choose from three different primary backup types: full, differential, and incremental. The decision to be made here is whether to use only full backups every time, or perform incremental or differential backups between full backups.   Deciding on which backups to perform can depend on many factors, such as the amount of data to be backed up, backup capacity and speed, and time constraints. If you have 2GB of data to back up, for example, and your tape drive can back up only 500MB per hour, the full backup will require four hours. But consider what you would do if you had only three hours to perform a backup during the week and six hours on the weekend. Obviously, in this case, you could not perform a full backup every night.   Incremental and differential backups come into play here. After you decide when you will be performing the full backup, you then need to decide whether to perform incremental or dif- ferential backups in between. The main difference between these two types is that differen- tial backups do not modify the archive setting for files, so every file changed since the last full backup is backed up. An incremental backup backs up only files that have been added or changed since the last full or incremental backup.    Project: Developing a Backup Policy  271  Taking these factors into account, you then need to decide which type of backup works bet- ter for you. Obviously, an incremental backup is going to be faster over multiple nights than a differential backup because it is backing up only files changed since the last full or incre- mental backup. The drawback to this choice is that you must restore the full backup set and then each incremental backup set. If you use differential backups between full backups, you would need to restore only the full backup and then the last differential backup because each differential backup set includes all files changed since the last full backup.    PART  III  Controlling DOS  10 Working with System Information 275  11 Controlling Your Environment 293  12 Using Peripherals 307  13 Controlling Devices 317  14 Understanding the International Features of DOS 339    CHAPTER  10  Working with System Information In this chapter  Changing the Date and Time 276  Displaying the Version Using the VER Command 279  Setting the Version Using the SETVER Command 280  Displaying Memory Statistics 283  Loading a Secondary Command Processor 288   276  Chapter 10 Working with System Information  Changing the Date and Time  In Chapter 5, ”Understanding Files and Directories,” you learned a bit about how DOS stores files using a directory. This directory maintains critical information about each file on your disk, including the filename, its attributes, its size, and where it is stored on the disk. It also contains date and time information that indicates when the file was last updated. This information is often referred to as a date and time stamp. This stamp is updated from the sys- tem date and time whenever you make changes to the file.  Your computer uses a battery-powered clock to maintain the date and time used by your  system. Even when the computer is turned off, power from the battery goes to the chip con- taining the clock, and the date and time remain current.  Setting the date and time becomes increasingly important as you create more files on your computer. Because the DOS file-naming rules limit you to only eight characters in the root filename and three characters in the file extension  which is generally used to indicate the file type , the names of your files might not be very descriptive. In this situation, you might need to rely on the date and time stamp to tell which file is the most recent. On computers without a clock or with a clock that has a dead battery, however, the date and time are set to the same value each time you turn on the computer. This situation makes it difficult for you—or DOS—to tell the difference between an old file and a revised or new file. In addi- tion, some DOS commands work by comparing file dates. If your system time and date are not correct, these commands will have little value to you.  Occasionally checking your computer’s date and time is worthwhile. All batteries eventually fail and need replacing. All clocks in personal computers lose time. How much time your clock loses depends on the programs you run on your computer.  The clock that keeps the date and time in a PC is controlled by an electronic component in the computer—the system timer. This chip is the heartbeat of the computer. Everything the computer does takes a known amount of time. The system timer provides a regular pulse that controls all the functions occurring in the computer.  One of these functions is to update the clock that DOS uses to tell the time  and conse- quently the date . Commands or other programs that cannot afford to be interrupted while they’re working tell DOS not to interrupt them until they finish what they’re doing. A typi- cal example is a communications program that waits for a character to be sent from another computer. If DOS is busy performing other tasks, such as updating the clock, the program might miss the character. Consequently, this type of program disables the interrupts; the program tells DOS to do nothing else for the period that it needs full control. During these times, the clock is not updated. These periods are typically only a fraction of a second, but the effect is cumulative, and eventually the time loss is noticeable.  If you do not have an AUTOEXEC.BAT file  see Chapter 2, “Starting DOS” , DOS displays the current date and time when you start your computer and gives you the opportunity to change them. You should take a moment to check these settings. Make sure that you set the date and time correctly whenever you are prompted because both are used in many DOS operations.   Changing the Date and Time  277  Most people,  however, use an AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This file seldom contains the commands necessary to change the date and time. In these instances, DOS uses its current settings. If you later notice that the date and time are incorrect  for example, a newly created file might contain the wrong date and time , you should change them by using the DATE and TIME com- mands.  Issuing the DATE Command  DATE is an internal command that is simple to use. It has only one possible parameter, as shown in the following syntax: DATE today  If you type DATE at the DOS prompt and then press Enter, DOS shows you the date cur- rently being used by your system and then prompts you for a new date: Current date is Fri 08-17-2001 Enter new date  mm-dd-yy :  The date that is displayed might or might not be correct; you can change it by entering a new date or accept it by pressing Enter. Alternatively, if you don’t want to see what the cur- rent date setting is, you can enter the DATE command followed by the date you want your system to use.  The exact format you should use for entering a date depends on the country code set in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS,” includes a discussion of the country code settings.  The date format can be one of the fol- lowing formats:  Part III Ch 10  Country Code North America  Europe  East Asia  Format  mm-dd-yy mm-dd-yyyy  dd-mm-yy dd-mm-yyyy  yy-mm-dd yyyy-mm-dd  mm is the month, dd is the day, and yy and yyyy are the year. To set the date to December 23, 2001, on a machine configured for North America, for example, you can enter the following line at the DOS prompt: DATE 12-23-2001  If you use two digits instead of four, DOS will assume that the first two digits should be 19. Rather than the hyphen, you can use periods or slashes as separators. Leading zeros are not required. If the month is January, for example, you can use 1  instead of typing 01  for the month.   278  Chapter 10 Working with System Information  Issuing the TIME Command  If you want to change the date, letting DOS prompt you is the best way to use this com- mand because the current date setting appears in the correct format, and you can copy this format rather than remember it. The DOS screen might appear as follows if you let DOS prompt you for the current date: C:\>DATE Current date is Fri 08-17-2001 Enter new date  mm-dd-yy : 12-23-2001  Pressing Enter when DOS prompts you for a new date retains the current setting. If you don’t enter the date correctly or if you select a date that is outside the range supported by DOS, you see the error message Invalid date, after which you can again try to enter a date.  Closely related to the DATE command is the internal TIME command. It also has only one possible parameter: TIME now  As with DATE, if you type only TIME and press Enter at the DOS prompt, DOS shows you the current time setting and prompts you for a new one. You can change the time without being prompted by including the new time on the command line as a parameter.  When you enter a new time setting, you do so using hours, minutes, and seconds. The exact format you should use depends on the country code setting in your CONFIG.SYS file.  You can use either a 12-hour or 24-hour clock. The following line shows the format used for a 24-hour clock: hrs:mins:secs.1 100secs  hrs is the hour, a number from 0 to 23; mins is the minutes, a number from 0 to 59; secs is the seconds, a number from 0 to 59; and 1 100secs is the number of one-hundredth sec- onds, a number from 0 to 99. The 24-hour clock starts with midnight as 00:00.00. You can use a period rather than a colon when separating the hours, minutes, and seconds, or a comma in place of a period when separating the seconds from the hundredths of a second.  If you decide to enter the time using a 12-hour clock, the format is the same as for the 24- hour clock except that hrs is a number from 1 to 12, and you add a or p to signify a.m. or p.m. If you do not add an a or a p, DOS assumes a.m.  Just because DOS enables you to enter time to the nearest 1 100 of a second, you don’t need to. In fact, you don’t need to enter all the parts of the time. DOS sets any missing ele- ments to zero  using the 24-hour clock notation . To set the time to 8:25 p.m., for example, you can enter one of the following lines at the DOS prompt: TIME 20:25  TIME 8:25p   Displaying the Version Using the VER Command  279  Either command sets the time to 8:25 p.m. The seconds and hundredths of a second are set to zero. To set the clock to 12:30 a.m., you can enter the following line: TIME :30  As with the DATE command, letting DOS prompt you for the time is the easiest way to use this command. When DOS displays the current time, all you need to do is enter a new time using the same format. Following is an example of how the DOS screen might appear if you let DOS prompt you for the current time: C:\>TIME Current time is 2:35:07.23p Enter new time: 2:40p  You can use the COUNTRY command to change the format DOS uses to display the time   see Chapter 14 .  Displaying the Version Using the VER Command  DOS includes an internal command that displays the DOS version currently in use. Knowing how to use the VER command is invaluable if you ever work with an unfamiliar computer. Some commands, such as DISKCOMP, FORMAT, and XCOPY, work differently or are not available with different DOS versions. If you do not know which version of DOS a  computer is using, the VER command can tell you.  When you enter the VER command at the DOS prompt, you see a message similar to  this one: MS-DOS Version 6.20  This is the DOS version used to boot your computer. If a computer with a hard disk is booted from a floppy disk, the version of DOS might not be what you expected. Suppose that your hard disk is formatted for DOS 6.2, but you use a DOS 5.0 floppy disk to boot your computer. The Version 6.2 commands on your hard disk might not work while your computer is running a different version of DOS. In this instance, the following message appears when you try to use one of the DOS 6.22 commands: Incorrect DOS Version  Sometimes DOS can be slightly different even within the same version. Some computer manufacturers supply DOS packages specially designed to work with their machines, so  you might see a different message if you use a different product. Compaq Computer Corporation’s version of DOS, for example, includes Compaq’s name with the version num- ber. Because of the differences between these versions, you might be able to track down problems on an unfamiliar computer more easily if you first determine the exact DOS  version number and its manufacturer.  Part III Ch 10   280  Chapter 10 Working with System Information  Setting the Version Using the SETVER Command When a new version of DOS is released, some time passes before software manufacturers can upgrade popular applications programs to take full advantage of DOS’s new features. Many programs ask the operating system to tell them which version of DOS the computer is running. If a program does not recognize the version of DOS in memory, it might refuse to run. One or more of your applications, therefore, might refuse to run because they have not been certified by the manufacturer to run properly with DOS 6.22.  You can get a reluctant program to run under DOS 6.22 in two ways:    Contact the software manufacturer or your dealer to find out whether you need a pro-  gram upgrade.    Use the SETVER command to add the name of the program to DOS 6.2’s version table. The version table is a list of programs with DOS version numbers listed next to them. When a program listed in the version table loads into memory and asks DOS for its version number, DOS reports the version number listed in the version table rather than the actual version number—6.2. The application is fooled into running under DOS 6.2.  The first option is the better choice. By checking with the manufacturer, you can determine whether the software has been tested in DOS 6.22.  If you use SETVER, you run the risk, however slight, that your program might become cor- rupted if it is incompatible with DOS 6.2.  The SETVER command operates as both a device driver and an executable command. Before DOS can use the version table, you must load SETVER.EXE as a device driver. Make sure that the command is included in your CONFIG.SYS file so that it executes every time you start your computer. If SETVER.EXE is not in your CONFIG.SYS file, you need to add it. To do so, use the following syntax: DEVICE=d:path\SETVER.EXE  The parameters d: and path\ are the disk and directory that contain the SETVER.EXE external program file. When you installed DOS, the installation program created a default CONFIG.SYS file for you, which includes the following command: DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE  After the device driver SETVER.EXE is loaded into memory, DOS can use the version table to report different DOS versions to applications programs listed in the version table.  To see whether a particular program is already in the version table, use SETVER from the DOS command line. To do so, type SETVER at the DOS prompt; do not add switches, file- names, or parameters. DOS displays a two-column listing with program names in the first column and the DOS version number the programs will work with in the second column. Microsoft has already tested the programs listed in the initial version table and determined   Setting the Version Using the SETVER Command  281  Part III Ch 10  that they operate properly in DOS 6.22. The version list that appears on your screen should resemble the following list: KERNEL.EXE      5.00 NETX.COM        5.00 NETX.EXE        5.00 NET5.COM        5.00 BNETX.COM       5.00 BNETX.EXE       5.00 EMSNETX.EXE     5.00 EMSNET5.EXE     5.00 XMSNETX.EXE     5.00 XMSNET5.EXE     5.00 DOSOAD.SYS      5.00 REDIR50.EXE     5.00 REDIR5.EXE      5.00 REDIRALL.EXE    5.00 REDIRNP4.EXE    5.00 EDLIN.EXE       5.00 BACKUP.EXE      5.00 ASSIGN.COM      5.00 EXE2BIN.EXE     5.00 JOIN.EXE        5.00 RECOVER.EXE     5.00 GRAFTABL.COM    5.00 LMSETUP.EXE     5.00 STACKER.COM     5.00 NCACHE.EXE      5.00 NCACHE2.EXE     5.00 IBMCACHE.SYS    3.40 XTRADRV.SYS     5.00 2XON.COM        5.00 WINWORD.EXE     4.10 EXCEL.EXE       4.10 LL3.EXE         4.01 REDIR4.EXE      4.00 REDIR40.EXE     4.00 MSREDIR.EXE     4.00 WIN200.BIN      3.40 METRO.EXE       3.31 WIN100.BIN      3.40 HITACHI.SYS     4.00 MSCDEX.EXE      4.00 NET.EXE         4.00 NET.COM         3.30 NETWKSTA.EXE    4.00 DXMA0MOD.SYS    3.30 BAN.EXE         4.00 BAN.COM         4.00 DD.EXE          4.01 DD.BIN          4.01 REDIR.EXE       4.00 SYQ55.SYS       4.00 SSTDRIVE.SYS    4.00 ZDRV.SYS        4.01 ZFMT.SYS        4.01 TOPSRDR.EXE     4.00   282  Chapter 10 Working with System Information  When you run one of the programs listed in the first column of the version table, DOS reports to the program the DOS version number listed in the second column.  If you try to run a program and it displays an error message stating that you are using an incompatible version of DOS, you might want to try adding the program to the version table. Enter the SETVER command using the following syntax: SETVER filespec n.nn  The filespec parameter indicates the full name of the file in question, including a path, a filename, and an extension. The n.nn parameter is a DOS version number that the program will recognize. Consult the program’s documentation to determine with which versions of DOS the program can run.  You also can use SETVER to delete program names. The syntax for using SETVER to delete programs from the version table is shown in the following line: SETVER filespec  DELETE  QUIET  The two switches— DELETE and  QUIET—can be abbreviated as  D and  Q.  For an example of how you use SETVER, assume that you want to run a program called  GOODPROG.EXE, but the program runs only with DOS versions 3.0 to 3.3. To add GOODPROG.EXE to the version table, type the following command at the command prompt  and press Enter: SETVER GOODPROG.EXE 3.30  DOS displays the following series of messages, including an initial warning: WARNING - The application you are adding to the MS-DOS version table may not have been verified by Microsoft on this version of MS-DOS. Please contact your software vendor for information on whether this application will operate properly under this version of MS-DOS. If you execute this application by instructing MS-DOS to report a different MS-DOS version number, you may lose or corrupt data, or cause system instabilities. In that circumstance, Microsoft is not responsible for any loss or damage.  Version table successfully updated  The version change will take effect the next time you restart your system.  To verify that the application has been added to the version table, execute SETVER again without switches or parameters. The added application appears at the end of the list. The modified table takes effect, however, only after you restart or reboot your computer.  If you later decide to delete a program from the version list, use the  D switch and the  filename parameter. To delete GOODPROG.EXE from the version table, for example, type one  of the following commands at the command line and press Enter: SETVER GOODPROG.EXE  DELETE  SETVER GOODPROG.EXE  D  DOS deletes the application name from the version table and displays this message: Version table successfully updated   Displaying Memory Statistics  283  The version change takes effect the next time you start your system.  If you are using a batch file to delete a program name from the version table, you might want to suppress the preceding message. To prevent this message from appearing onscreen, add the  QUIET switch in addition to the  DELETE switch.  Part III Ch 10  Displaying Memory Statistics  One of the handiest DOS commands is MEM. This external command enables you to deter- mine how memory is being used on your system.  For a discussion of the types of memory in your system, see Chapter 1, “DOS and the Personal Computer.”   Issuing the MEM Command  The following line shows the syntax for the MEM command: MEM  DEBUG  CLASSIFY  FREE  MODULE:programname  PAGE  All switches are optional, and you will find it handy to abbreviate each switch by typing only the first letter   D,  C,  F,  M:programname,  P . Each switch is independent, meaning that you cannot use them together. The only exception is the  PAGE switch, which tells DOS to pause at the end of each screen it displays. This switch is handy to use because the output generated by MEM can easily run longer than a single screen.  The  DEBUG switch lists all the loaded programs and device drivers. This listing includes the name, size, position, and type of each item.  The  CLASSIFY switch lists the programs loaded into conventional memory as well as in upper memory—the 384KB area of memory between 640KB and 1MB that is usually reserved for use by certain system devices, such as your monitor.  The  FREE switch lists the free areas of conventional and upper memory. The  MODULE: programname switch shows the way a program module is currently using memory. You must specify the program name after the  MODULE switch. The MEM  MODULE switch lists the areas of memory the program module is using and shows the address and size of each area.  Understanding the Operation of MEM  To see a “short” version of the memory report that indicates the amount of conventional memory, EMS memory, and XMS memory, just enter MEM at the DOS prompt, without any switches. DOS displays a report similar to this one: Memory Type        Total  =   Used  +   Free ---------------   -------   -------   ------- Conventional         640K       79K      562K Upper                 71K       33K       38K Reserved             384K      384K        0K Extended  XMS *    7,097K    2,537K    4,560K   284  Chapter 10 Working with System Information  ---------------   -------   -------   ------- Total memory       8,192K    3,033K    5,159K  Total under 1 MB     711K      112K      599K  Total Expanded  EMS                 7,488K  7,667,712 bytes  Free Expanded  EMS *                4,800K  4,915,200 bytes   * EMM386 is using XMS memory to simulate EMS memory as needed.  Free EMS memory may change as free XMS memory changes.  Largest executable program size       561K  574,752 bytes  Largest free upper memory block        22K   22,016 bytes  MS-DOS is resident in the high memory area.  This report gives you three types of information about every type of memory in your sys- tem, in three columns: the total amount, the amount currently being used, and the memory available for you to use for programs.  The first line describes the conventional memory: the total amount  generally 640KB;  1KB = 1,024 bytes , the amount of memory currently being used, and the amount of free memory. The next line shows you the amount of upper  reserved  memory and adapter RAM ROM in the same format. These two amounts total 384KB, which, in addition to the conventional memory, is the total amount of memory that DOS addresses—1,024KB.  The MEM report then tells you the total amount of extended memory that has been mapped  converted  to XMS memory, the amount currently in use, and the amount available for use. In the example, 4,560KB of XMS memory of the original 7,097KB are available.  The next line shows the total amount of memory under 1MB and the amount available to you for running programs. This amount might be misleading because the figure lumps together the amount of free conventional and free reserved memory. Most programs cannot use both of these types of memory as if they were contiguous.  The first two long lines following the totals show the total amount and free amount of expanded memory in your system. A footnote explains that the EMM386.EXE memory manag- er creates expanded memory from the pool of XMS memory as needed. Finally, MEM indi- cates whether MS-DOS currently is loaded in the high memory area.  Sometimes, MEM’s short report doesn’t provide enough information to meet your needs. MEM therefore provides three switches to produce longer versions of the report. Because these reports don’t fit on a single screen, you can use the  PAGE switch to display one page of the report at a time.  The reports generated by MEM’s  CLASSIFY and  DEBUG switches are highly technical in con- tent. For example, to execute the MEM command with the  DEBUG switch, enter the following line at the DOS prompt: MEM  DEBUG   Displaying Memory Statistics  285  A report similar to this one appears: Conventional Memory Detail:  Segment               Total        Name         Type -------               -----        ----         ----  00000              1,039     1K                Interrupt Vector 00040                271     0K                ROM Communication Area 00050                527     1K                DOS Communication Area 00070              2,752     3K   IO           System Data  CON       System Device Driver AUX       System Device Driver PRN       System Device Driver CLOCK$    System Device Driver A: - D:   System Device Driver COM1      System Device Driver LPT1      System Device Driver LPT2      System Device Driver LPT3      System Device Driver COM2      System Device Driver COM3      System Device Driver COM4      System Device Driver  Part III Ch 10  0011C              5,600     5K   MSDOS        System Data 0027A             49,712    49K   IO           System Data  1,152     1K      XMSXXXX0  Installed Device=HIMEM 3,104     3K      EMMXXXX0  Installed Device=EMM386  37,648    37K      DBLSYSH$  Installed Device=DBLSPACE  1,600     2K                FILES=32  256     0K                FCBS=4 512     1K                BUFFERS=10  2,288     2K                LASTDRIVE=Z 3,008     3K                STACKS=9,256  00E9D                 80     0K   MSDOS        System Program 00EA2              2,656     3K   COMMAND      Program 00F48                 80     0K   MSDOS        -- Free -- 00F4D                528     1K   COMMAND      Environment 00F6E                128     0K   MSDOS        -- Free -- 00F76             17,088    17K   MOUSE        Program 013A2                160     0K   MEM          Environment 013AC             88,992    87K   MEM          Program 02966            485,776   474K   MSDOS        -- Free --  Upper Memory Detail:  Segment  Region       Total        Name         Type -------  ------   ---------------  ----------   --------  0CD4A       1        800     1K   IO           System Data  0CD7C       1      4,224     4K   IO           System Data  4,192     4K      CON       Installed Device=ANSI  768     1K      SETVERXX  Installed Device=SETVER  0CE84       1         48     0K   MSDOS        -- Free -- 0CE87       1     29,024    28K   SMARTDRV     Program 0D59D       1     16,432    16K   MSDOS        -- Free -- 0D9A0       1     22,016    22K   MSDOS        -- Free --   286  Chapter 10 Working with System Information  Memory Summary:  Type of Memory       Total   =    Used    +    Free ----------------  ----------   ----------   ---------- Conventional         655,360       80,384      574,976 Upper                 72,576       34,080       38,496 Reserved             393,216      393,216            0 Extended  XMS *    7,267,456    2,598,016    4,669,440 ----------------  ----------   ----------   ---------- Total memory       8,388,608    3,105,696    5,282,912  Total under 1 MB     727,936      114,464      613,472  Handle      EMS Name      Size ------      --------      ----  0                  060000  Total Expanded  EMS                  7,667,712  7,488K  Free Expanded  EMS *                 4,915,200  4,800K   * EMM386 is using XMS memory to simulate EMS memory as needed.

To see a listing of programs, drivers, and free space in conventional and upper memory, type the following command and press Enter: MEM  C  DOS shows you a report similar to this one: Modules using memory below 1 MB:  Name           Total       =   Conventional   +   Upper Memory --------  ----------------   ----------------   ---------------- MSDOS       18,029    18K      18,029    18K           0     0K  HIMEM        1,168     1K       1,168     1K           0     0K  EMM386       3,120     3K       3,120     3K           0     0K  DBLSPACE    37,664    37K      37,664    37K           0     0K  COMMAND      3,184     3K       3,184     3K           0     0K  MOUSE       17,088    17K      17,088    17K           0     0K    Displaying Memory Statistics  287  Part III Ch 10  SETVER         816     1K           0     0K         816     1K  ANSI         4,240     4K           0     0K       4,240     4K  SMARTDRV    29,024    28K           0     0K      29,024    28K  Free       613,472   599K     574,976   562K      38,496    38K   Memory Summary:  Type of Memory       Total   =    Used    +    Free ----------------  ----------   ----------   ---------- Conventional         655,360       80,384      574,976 Upper                 72,576       34,080       38,496 Reserved             393,216      393,216            0 Extended  XMS *    7,267,456    2,598,016    4,669,440 ----------------  ----------   ----------   ---------- Total memory       8,388,608    3,105,696    5,282,912  Total under 1 MB     727,936      114,464      613,472  Total Expanded  EMS                  7,667,712  7,488K  Free Expanded  EMS *                 4,915,200  4,800K   * EMM386 is using XMS memory to simulate EMS memory as needed.

Because some of the report scrolls off the screen before you can read it, you might want to use the  P switch to tell DOS to pause after each page. To do so, type the following line: MEM  C  P  DOS displays the report one page at a time. Press any key when you are ready to display the next page.  The third and fourth columns of the report, titled Conventional and Upper Memory, show you how much memory is allocated to any particular driver or program. Use the Upper Memory column to determine whether any drivers or programs are loaded in upper memo- ry, and use the Memory Summary at the end of the report to see how much upper memory is still free.  Before attempting to move a driver or program from conventional to upper memory  using DEVICEHIGH or LOADHIGH , compare the driver or program’s size  in the Conventional memo- ry size column  to the available upper memory block  UMB  size shown at the bottom of the memory summary. The available UMB must be at least as big as the driver or program before you can load the driver or program into upper memory.  A quick way to see a listing of free memory space without searching through one of the longer reports is to use the  FREE switch, as shown in the following line: MEM  F   288  Chapter 10 Working with System Information  If you use this switch, MEM lists the free areas of conventional and upper memory. This report shows you the segment address and size of each free area of conventional memory and the largest free block in each region of upper memory. The switch also summarizes your overall memory use. A sample of the report follows: Free Conventional Memory:  Segment         Total -------   ----------------- 00F48           80     0K  00F6E          128     0K  013A2          160     0K  013AC       88,992    87K  02966      485,776   474K   Total Free: 575,136   562K   Free Upper Memory:  Region   Largest Free     Total Free      Total Size ------  --------------  --------------  -------------- 1    22,016   22K    38,496   38K    72,576   71K   After you identify a driver or memory-resident program that appears to be the right size to fit in the available UMB, edit CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT to add DEVICEHIGH or LOADHIGH to the appropriate command or program file. Reboot your computer and issue the MEM  C command again to see whether the driver or program loaded.  To arrive at the best combination of device drivers and memory-resident programs loaded into upper memory, you might have to experiment a little. DOS loads programs into the largest available UMB first, so try loading the largest drivers and programs first by placing their startup commands earliest in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Loading a Secondary Command Processor  The COMMAND command enables you to load a second copy of COMMAND.COM, the system’s com- mand processor. Many programs load this processor automatically when they enable you to go to a DOS command prompt without exiting the program. Although you might not have much need to load another command processor in your everyday use of DOS, you might want to do so from within a batch file so that you can run another program in its own envi- ronment.  Issuing the COMMAND Command  The syntax for COMMAND is shown here: COMMAND d:path\  P  MSG  E:aaaaa  C string  K   For this command, d:path\ is the drive and path position of the COMMAND.COM file you are loading. The other parameters are explained briefly in the list that follows and in more detail in the next section:   Loading a Secondary Command Processor  289  Part III Ch 10  Parameter   P   MSG   E:aaaaa   C string   Y   K  Description Makes the second copy of the command processor permanent Causes DOS to load DOS messages into memory instead of reading the messages from disk every time they are needed Enables you to adjust the number of bytes of memory that the command processor reserves for its environment Enables you to pass a string of characters to the command processor being started Directs COMMAND.COM to step through the batch file specified by the  C or  K switch  Causes the program or named batch file to be run, with  the system prompt that belongs to this second iteration of COMMAND.COM being displayed after the program terminates  Understanding the Operation of COMMAND.COM  COMMAND.COM, your command processor, reserves a small amount of memory called the envi- ronment. It uses this memory space to store variables, such as your PATH, PROMPT, and COMSPEC settings. If you load another copy of COMMAND.COM but omit the d:path\ parameter, the sec- ond command processor inherits the contents of the first command processor’s environ- ment. If you include the d:path\ parameter, the second command processor does not inherit the old environment and keeps only the COMSPEC path specified by d:path\.  After you start a secondary command processor, you exit it and return to the first command processor by using the EXIT command. When you leave the second command processor, the first command processor’s environment remains unchanged, even if you changed the second command processor’s environment while you were working with it.  The optional  P switch makes the second copy of the command processor permanent. The first command processor is no longer available, and DOS runs your AUTOEXEC.BAT file if you have one. Remember, if you use the  P switch, you cannot use the EXIT command to exit the second copy of the command processor and return to the first one. You have to turn off your computer and reboot.  The  MSG switch causes DOS to load DOS messages into memory instead of reading the messages from the disk every time they are needed. Using this switch improves the perfor- mance of DOS, but you lose some memory space.  The  E:aaaaa switch enables you to adjust the number of bytes of memory that the com- mand processor reserves for its environment. The minimum value for aaaaa is 160, and the maximum is 32768. The default is 256 bytes.  The recommended minimum value in a Windows environment is 512 bytes.  Each variable stored in the environment takes up space, and you might find that you run out of room in the environment. If, for example, the   290  Chapter 10 Working with System Information  environment needs to store long settings  such as the long prompt used in the earlier PROMPT command example , you might have to adjust the size of the environment. If you see the message Out of environment space, enlarge the environment.  The  C string option enables you to pass a string of characters to the command processor you are starting. This option generally was used in batch files  see Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files”  in DOS versions before 3.3 but is no longer needed with DOS 3.3 and later versions, in which it has been replaced by the CALL command.  If you are using DOS 6.22, and you use the  C switch to run a batch file under the  new command processor, you also can use the  Y switch to instruct COMMAND.COM to single-step through the batch file. This procedure is similar to the single-stepping of AUTOEXEC.BAT you can do when you first boot DOS. For more information on how  single-stepping works, refer to Chapter 2.  Using EXIT to Leave the Current Copy of the Command Processor  Use the EXIT command to leave the current copy of the command processor and return to the previously loaded copy. The syntax for the EXIT command is as follows: EXIT  No options or switches exist for this command. You cannot use the EXIT command if the second command processor was started by using the  P switch.  Uses for a Secondary Command Processor  Used together, the COMMAND and EXIT commands provide two interesting uses. If you have specified an alternative location with the file COMMAND.COM, you use COMMAND to load the sec- ond processor. If, for example, the DOS command processor is in the root directory and another command processor is loaded in the OTHER subdirectory, you can enter the following command: COMMAND C:\OTHER  E:320  This command loads the second COMMAND.COM and assigns it an environment size of 320 bytes. You can use the second command processor to execute commands using the 320-byte environment. When you are finished using the secondary command processor, type EXIT to return to the primary command processor.  You also can use this command pair when you have set up a complex environment and you want to execute a command with a basic environment without changing the existing envi- ronment. In this case, you can start the second command processor by using the d:path\ option. If necessary, you can change the environment by using the SET command, covered in Chapter 11, “Controlling Your Environment.” Execute the desired commands in the altered environment and then exit the second command processor.   Loading a Secondary Command Processor  291  If the command processor is in the root directory of drive C, enter the following command: COMMAND C:\  This command loads a second copy of the command processor. The new environment includes only a setting for COMSPEC, showing that the command processor is loaded in C:\. The prompt does not have a setting and shows up in the form C>. You then execute any desired commands in the new environment. After you finish issuing the commands, type EXIT to exit the second command processor and return to the first command processor. All the environment settings for the first command processor stay as they were originally.  The principles DOS uses to execute this command are also used by applications programs that enable you to suspend your program temporarily and go to DOS. When you select the DOSSHELL command within your word processor, for example, the program starts a second command processor. All the existing information is kept in memory with the first command processor. You execute DOS commands in the second command processor and type EXIT when the commands are complete. The first command processor is then active, and you return to your application program.  Part III Ch 10    CHAPTER  11  Controlling Your Environment In this chapter  Changing DOS Variables 294  Changing the User Interface 295  Changing Disk Drives 301   294  Chapter 11 Controlling Your Environment  Changing DOS Variables  The SET command enables you to adjust the DOS environment by changing the variables that are available to programs running under DOS. This command shows the current set- tings in the environment, or you can use the command to add or change environment vari- ables.  Issuing the SET Command  The syntax for the SET command is as follows: SET name=string  The variable name= is the name of the environment variable. The most frequently used envi- ronment variables are COMSPEC, PROMPT, and PATH. You can choose your own variable names in addition to these three, however. Many of the programs that you might use set their own environment variables, or require you to do so, before the program runs. These variables control the way the program works.  The parameter string is the value to which you want to set the variable. In the case of PATH, the string can be the list of directories through which you want DOS to search to find pro- gram files. If you use the name= parameter without a value for string, the variable specified is a null value  contains nothing . Using the name= parameter this way effectively removes the environment variable, and DOS no longer keeps track of it.  You also can type SET at the command prompt without any variables. The command then lists all the current settings for environment variables.  Changing Environment Variables with SET  Typically, you use the SET command as part of a batch file to set variables to be used within your system. Most often, SET is part of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, used to set the environment variables before any other programs are run.  If you examine your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you might see some command lines similar to the following: SET COMSPEC=C:\SYS\COMMAND.COM PROMPT=$p$g PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\SYS;  These commands, even though they look a bit different from each other, accomplish the same thing: They assign values to system variables. The first command tells DOS that the command processor, COMMAND.COM, is in the SYS subdirectory of drive C. The second com- mand sets the prompt to include the current path and a greater-than sign. The third com- mand defines the root directory, DOS directory, and SYS directory of drive C as the search path for DOS to use.  Notice that the second and third command lines do not explicitly include the SET command. It’s not included here because neither of these variables requires the SET command, although you can just as easily use these command lines:   Changing the User Interface  295  SET PROMPT=$p$g SET PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\SYS;  Defining Your Own Environmental Variables with SET  You also can use the SET command to set custom variables in the environment. These vari- ables usually are the names of directories or switches that programs use. The programs know to look for particular variables in the environment, take the values assigned to those variables, and use them in the program.  A word processing program, for example, might look for a dictionary file called DICT in the current directory. If you use the SET command, however, a different directory can contain the dictionary file. During installation, the program probably will insert a SET command in the batch file that invokes the program. This command can use the following form: SET DICT=C:\WP\DICT  This command enables the program to look in the WP directory for the dictionary file instead of looking in the current directory. Setting a variable in the environment, however, is useful only to programs that know to look for that variable.  Each variable stored in the environment occupies space. If a program needs large variables set, you might have to increase the area of memory set aside for the environment when DOS boots. You make this change through the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS  see Chapter 19, “Configuring Your Computer” .  Part III Ch 11  Changing the User Interface  User interface is a term that is often overused in computer circles. It does describe an integral part of computers, however—how you  the user  interact with the computer. DOS provides what has come to be known as a text-based user interface, meaning that you communicate with DOS via a command line. In Chapter 4, “Using the DOS Shell,” you learned about the DOS Shell, which provides a different user interface.  If you don’t want to use the DOS Shell, you can still modify how you interact with DOS. Primarily, you do so through two commands: PROMPT and MODE. The PROMPT command enables you to change what the DOS command prompt looks like, and the MODE command enables you to define how your system should work in conjunction with your video display.  Changing the Command Prompt with PROMPT  If you have ever booted a plain-vanillaversion of DOS  one that does not have a CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file , you probably noticed the default command prompt used by DOS. It looks like this: C>   296  Chapter 11 Controlling Your Environment  This default command prompt shows the current drive and a greater-than sign—that’s it. You can, however, create a command prompt that is much more useful. You do so by using the PROMPT command. If you look at your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, for example, you might see a line that looks like this: PROMPT $p$g  This line changes the default command-line prompt to the following: C:\>  Although this prompt might not look immediately more useful, its value becomes apparent if you switch to another directory on your drive. If you use the CD command, for example, to switch to the DOS subdirectory, your command prompt looks like this: C:\>cd\dos C:\DOS>  It now shows the directory where you are located. This display is of great value whenever you are issuing commands at the DOS prompt. If you use a hard disk, this display is the minimum recommended prompt setting because navigating subdirectories can be difficult if you don’t know your current position. For this reason, you will find this use of the PROMPT command in many people’s AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  The PROMPT command has many more settings that you can use to further refine your DOS prompt. Used to its fullest, the PROMPT command requires use of the ANSI.SYS device driver  see Chapter 17, “Understanding ANSI.SYS” . Even without using the ANSI.SYS device driver, however, you can choose from many different command prompts.  Issuing the PROMPT Command The syntax for the PROMPT command is simple: PROMPT string  The string consists of text that defines how you want the command prompt to appear. This text can contain special pairs of characters, called meta-strings, which consist of a dollar sign followed by one of the following characters: b    d    e    g    h    l    n    p    q    t    v    $  The string can contain any text or any number of meta-strings in any order. Table 11.1 lists the meaning of the different meta-strings.  Table 11.1 Meta-Strings for Use with the PROMPT Command  Meta-String  Displayed Information or Result Carriage return line feed  moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line   $_  $b  $d  $e  Vertical bar character     Date  Esc character   Changing the User Interface  297  Table 11.1 Continued  Meta-String $g  Displayed Information or Result Greater-than sign  >   Backspace  moves the cursor one space to the left   $h  $l  $n  $p  $q  $t  $v  $$  Less-than sign  <   Current drive  Current path  Equal sign  =   Time  DOS version  Dollar sign  Part III Ch 11  If you don’t like the current prompt and you want to reset it to the default originally used by DOS, you can enter the PROMPT command without any parameters. This command causes DOS to reset the prompt to the current drive letter and a greater-than sign.   Understanding the Use of Meta-Strings Earlier in this chapter, you saw an example of how to use meta-strings in a PROMPT command: PROMPT $p$g  This is just one possible use, albeit the most often used. You also can use other combina- tions, such as PROMPT Date: $d Time: $t$_$p$g  After you issue this command, your command prompt appears as follows: Date: Thu 03-22-2001 Time: 2:35:07.23 C:\WP\MEMOS>  Notice that this command creates a two-line command prompt which shows the current date and time, as well as the current directory. You can get as exotic as you want with your command prompt; its appearance is entirely up to you.  Changing the command prompt based on certain configurations you might have within  your system is not uncommon. Suppose that you use several different DOS programs, each of which requires its own special setup. You can create a batch file  see Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files”  that sets up the search paths and system variables necessary for properly using the program. If the name of this program is XYZ Spreadsheet, ver- sion 3.7, you might want to add the following line to the batch file that performs the  configuration:   298  Chapter 11 Controlling Your Environment  PROMPT Now using XYZ Spreadsheet, version 3.7$_$p$p  When this batch file executes, the command prompt becomes the following: Now using XYZ Spreadsheet, version 3.7 C:\SSDATA>  Now you can easily remember what configuration is active within your system. When you run another batch file to change the configuration again, a different prompt command that you have set up can indicate which configuration is in effect. Again, how you set up your command prompt is up to you and how you use your system.  Two of the meta-strings might require further explanation. You use the Esc character  $e  in association with the ANSI.SYS driver  see Chapter 17 for more information . In the same way that you use the dollar sign to indicate to DOS that the next character is a meta-string, you use the Esc character to signal ANSI.SYS that the next few characters are an ANSI.SYS com- mand.  You can :use the Backspace character  $h  to remove characters from the prompt. In the ear- lier PROMPT example that displayed the date and time, you might find the seconds and hun- dredths of a second in the displayed prompt are more of a distraction than they are helpful. You can alter the PROMPT command as follows: PROMPT Date: $d Time: $t$h$h$h$h$h$h$_$p$g  The result is the following improved prompt, with everything after the minutes erased: Date: Thu 03-22-2001 Time: 2:35 C:\WP\MEMOS>  Altering the Look of the Screen with MODE  You can use the external MODE command to customize the number of characters per line and the number of lines displayed onscreen. You also can use the MODE command to set the con- figuration of your computer ports  such as your printer port  and for code page switching.  Certain areas of memory in your system store the character tables for your video screen and your keyboard. By switching tables, you can configure DOS to use alternative character sets to suit your national language and customs. These tables are called code pages. For more information about code pages, see Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS.”  You might already know this fact, but it is possible to attach two types of video displays to your computer. You can use a monochrome adapter and display for your word processing, for example, and a color graphics adapter and display for a graphics program. You can switch between the displays by using the MODE command. When you type at the keyboard on a two-display system, you see the keystrokes only on one of the displays—the active display. The keyboard and active display make up the console. As you learned in Chapter 5, “Understanding Files and Directories,” DOS uses CON as the device name for the console.   Changing the User Interface  299  Selecting the Display Type To change display characteristics, you can use two forms of the MODE command  listed in Table 11.2 . The following is the simplest form: MODE dt  The abbreviation dt is the display type and mode. Available options are 40, 80, BW40, BW80, CO40, CO80, or MONO, as detailed in Table 11.2. The 40 and 80 refer to the number of text columns displayed. This setting means that you can choose between 40 and 80 characters per line. BW stands for black and white, CO stands for color, and MONO refers to the mono- chrome display adapter.  Table 11.2  MODE Settings for Display Type  Command  MODE 40  MODE 80  MODE BW40  MODE BW80  MODE CO40  MODE CO80  MODE MONO  Meaning Sets the display to 40 characters per line  Sets the display to 80 characters per line  Selects the color display in black-and-white mode, 40 characters per line  Selects the color display in black-and-white mode, 80 characters per line  Selects the color display, 40 characters per line  Selects the color display, 80 characters per line  Selects the monochrome display  Shifting the Screen on a Color Graphics Adapter The second form of the MODE command is for use on a Color Graphics Adapter  CGA  only. This form, which does not work on an Enhanced Graphics Adapter  EGA  or a Video Graphics Array  VGA , enables you to configure your PC to work with a television instead of a specially designed computer monitor. It moves the horizontal position of the image on your screen. If you cannot see the far-left or far-right character onscreen, the following command corrects the problem: MODE dt,dir,T  The dt parameter is the display type described in the preceding section. The dir parameter can have the value R to move the image to the right or L to move the image to the left. If the display is in 80-column mode, MODE moves the image two characters to the right or left. If in 40-column mode, MODE moves the image one character to the right or left.  The optional T parameter, when used, causes MODE to display a test pattern that you can use to align the display. Say you type the following: MODE CO80,R,T  A line of 80 characters appears across the screen, along with the following prompt: Do you see the leftmost 0?  y n   Part III Ch 11   300  Chapter 11 Controlling Your Environment  If you respond N to the prompt, this image moves two positions to the right of its preceding position. If you respond Y to the prompt, the test is completed and the prompt is erased. Using the L option works in the same manner but moves the image to the left.  If you operate your system after shifting the screen, you have a little less memory available for your use. To display the image in an adjusted position, DOS leaves a small portion of the MODE command in memory, occupying about 1KB of memory. This program intercepts all output, adjusts it, and then sends it to the screen.  Using MODE to Adjust the Number of Columns or Lines Onscreen You also can use MODE to adjust the number of columns or number of lines displayed onscreen. You must install the ANSI.SYS device driver before MODE can adjust your screen, however.  One way you can use MODE to adjust screen size is the following: MODE CON COLS=a LINES=b  COLS= sets the number of columns displayed onscreen to a, and LINES= sets the number of lines displayed onscreen to b. If you omit a setting for the number of columns or number of lines, the current setting is preserved.  Valid numbers for a are 40 or 80. Valid numbers for b on a VGA screen are 25, 43, or 50; valid numbers for b on an EGA screen are 25 or 43.  If ANSI.SYS is loaded via the CONFIG.SYS file, typing the following command gives you a dis- play mode 80 columns wide and 43 lines high on a computer with an EGA or VGA adapter and monitor: MODE CON COLS=80 LINES=43  After you set the display mode, you can start your application program. The display mode remains, unless the application resets it. If you use the preceding MODE command on a com- puter with an EGA screen, for example, you can use WordPerfect in 43-line mode without adjusting any settings in WordPerfect.  Not all applications can “see” that the extra lines are available. Try some MODE CON com- mands to determine whether you can use the extra lines. Using MODE CON to set your screen to 43 or 50 lines makes it easier to view long DIR listings, but the type is very small and can be difficult to read.  Another MODE command option enables you to alter the number of lines displayed without specifying that the screen is the console. This form, which is really a variation on the MODE CON format, is handy when you use an auxiliary console instead of CON. Chapter 13, “Controlling Devices,” introduces the CTTY command, which establishes another device as the standard input-and-output device. The syntax for this form of the MODE command is as follows: MODE dt,b   Changing Disk Drives  301  In this syntax, dt is the display type, and b is the number of lines to be displayed. The acceptable values for dt and b are as previously described, but not all combinations of values for dt and b are possible. For example, you cannot adjust the number of lines on a mono- chrome or CGA monitor. Table 11.3 lists the workable combinations of parameters with the MODE command for setting the display type.

An incorrect command does not damage anything, and DOS provides reasonably clear error messages. If the ANSI.SYS driver is required and not installed, for example, DOS displays the following error message: ANSI.SYS must be installed to perform requested function  Changing Disk Drives  As you configure DOS to the environment you need, you might find times when you need to adjust how DOS treats your disk drives and directories. Three commands enable you to do just that. You use the ASSIGN command to redirect disk requests to different drives, the JOIN command to treat a disk drive as a subdirectory, and the SUBST command to treat a sub- directory as a disk drive.   302  Chapter 11 Controlling Your Environment  The ASSIGN Command  You use the external command ASSIGN to redirect all DOS read-and-write  input-and-out- put  requests from one drive to another. Each drive is a DOS device. When you use the ASSIGN command, DOS can interrogate a different disk from the one actually specified on a command line.  The FORMAT and DISKCOPY commands ignore any drive ASSIGN commands.  The syntax for the ASSIGN command is as follows: ASSIGN d1=d2 ... STATUS  d1 is the drive letter for the original disk drive; d2 is the drive letter for the reassignment. The ellipsis  ...  indicates that you can reassign more than one drive on a single command line.   STATUS, issued with no other parameters, displays a listing of current drive assignments  The JOIN Command  You can use the JOIN command to add a disk drive to the directory structure of another disk. The external command JOIN, for example, enables you to use a floppy disk in such a way that it appears to DOS to be part of a hard disk. You also can use JOIN if you have two hard disks: drive C and drive D. JOIN can attach drive D to a subdirectory on drive C, for instance.  The syntax for JOIN is as follows: JOIN d1: d2:\path  D  The directory structure of disk d1 is added to the directory structure of hard disk d2. d1: is a valid disk drive name that becomes the alias or nickname. d1: might be a nonexistent disk drive. d2:\path is the valid disk drive name and directory path that will be nicknamed d1:. If you use the  D switch, the alias is deleted.  When you use the JOIN command, DOS redirects any access from d2:\path to d1:. Thus, if you use the command JOIN A: C:\SSDATA  any time you access C:\SSDATA, you actually are accessing drive A. This capability is helpful if you have a program that can look only in a specific directory for data and you actually want to keep the data elsewhere.  The SUBST Command  The external command SUBST is the inverse of the JOIN command. Instead of grafting a sec- ond disk onto the tree structure of your hard drive, the SUBST command splits a disk’s direc- tory structure in two. In effect, the SUBST command creates an alias disk drive name for a subdirectory.   Changing Disk Drives  303  Issuing the SUBST Command You can use the SUBST command to perform different functions. To establish an alias, use the following syntax: SUBST d1: d2:\pathname  To delete an alias, use this form: SUBST d1:  D  To see the current aliases, use the following form: SUBST  The SUBST command replaces a pathname for a subdirectory with a drive letter. After a SUBST command is in effect, DOS translates all I O  input output  requests to a particular drive letter back to the correct pathname. The alias drive created by the SUBST command inherits the directory tree structure of the subdirectory reassigned to a drive letter.  As the default, DOS assigns the LASTDRIVE= parameter  used in CONFIG.SYS  a value of E. You can make higher drive designators, however, by inserting a LASTDRIVE= parameter into the CONFIG.SYS file. DOS then establishes as DOS devices each of the drive letters up to and including the specified LASTDRIVE. When you use the SUBST command, DOS understands that you are referring to a device.  Using SUBST to Reference a Path with a Drive Letter SUBST is commonly used in two different situations. If you want to run a program that does not support pathnames, you can use the SUBST command to assign a drive letter to a directo- ry. The program then refers to the drive letter, and DOS translates the request into a path. If, for example, the data for a program is stored in C:\WORDPROC, you can use the following command so that you can refer to this subdirectory as drive E: SUBST E: C:\WORDPROC  After the substitution is made, you can issue the following command: SUBST  The following message appears: E: => C:\WORDPROC  To disconnect the substitution of drive E for the C:\WORDPROC directory, type the following command: SUBST E:  D  The other use for SUBST is to reduce typing long pathnames. When more than one person uses a PC, pathnames can become quite long because each user can use a separate section of the hard disk to store data files and common areas of the disk to store programs. If the paths \USER1\WORDDATA and \USER1\SSDATA exist on drive C, for example, you can reduce the typ- ing required to reach files in the directories by using the following command:  Part III Ch 11   304  Chapter 11 Controlling Your Environment  SUBST E: C:\USER1  Issuing a directory command on drive E produces the following listing: Volume in drive E is HARD DISK C Volume Serial Number is 1573-0241 Directory of  E:\  .                  05-02-92  12:07p ..                 05-02-92  12:07p WORDDATA           05-02-92   1:59p SSDATA           05-22-01   2:08p  4 File s           0 bytes  3477824 bytes free  The volume label given is the label from drive C, but the directory itself contains the con- tents of C:\USER1.  Do not use the following DOS commands in conjunction with drives that you create with the SUBST command: ASSIGN, BACKUP, CHKDSK, DEFRAG, DISKCOMP, DISKCOPY, FDISK, FORMAT, LABEL, MIRROR, RECOVER, RESTORE, SCANFIX, and SYS. Some of these com- mands might refuse to work, and others might provide unwanted results.  As with JOIN and ASSIGN, you can use the SUBST command to fool software that insists on using an otherwise unusable drive. A friend might have written an applications program, for example, that makes direct reference in its code to a directory on drive C. By using SUBST, you can have your friend’s program attach drive D to a subdirectory on your drive C.  Understanding the General Rules for Using SUBST As you are using the SUBST command, you must keep the following rules in mind:    d1: and d2: must be different.   You cannot specify a networked drive as d1: or d2:.   d1: cannot be the current drive.   d1: must have a designator less than the value in the LASTDRIVE statement of  CONFIG.SYS.  See Chapter 19 for more information on CONFIG.SYS.     Do not use SUBST with ASSIGN or JOIN.   Remove all SUBST settings before you run ASSIGN, BACKUP, DEFRAG, DISKCOMP, DISKCOPY,  FDISK, FORMAT, LABEL, MIRROR, PRINT, RECOVER, RESTORE, SCANFIX, or SYS.    Beware of using APPEND, CHDIR, MKDIR, PATH, and RMDIR with any drives reassigned.  Using the COMSPEC Variable  COMSPEC is a reserved system variable name that defines your command processor’s location. Typically, it is set to the complete path and filename for COMMAND.COM. If your command   Changing Disk Drives  305  processor is not in the root directory of the boot drive, you must include an appropriate SHELL directive in CONFIG.SYS to inform DOS of the command processor’s location. This command, in turn, automatically sets the COMSPEC variable correctly. Thus, you don’t need to explicitly set the COMSPEC variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file if you use the SHELL directive. If you do not have the COMSPEC variable set on your system, your system might hang when you boot your computer or when you leave an application program that needs to reload the command processor. This failure occurs because the system cannot find the command processor. Refer to Chapter 19 for information on how to use the SHELL directive in  CONFIG.SYS to tell the system where to find the command processor.  Part III Ch 11    CHAPTER  12  Using Peripherals In this chapter  Understanding Device Drivers 308  Setting Up Device Drivers 312  Troubleshooting Device Drivers 314   308  Chapter 12 Using Peripherals  Understanding Device Drivers  Unlike some operating systems, such as Windows 9x ME, NT 2000, or OS 2, DOS does not include much built-in support for peripheral devices. Instead, most devices require the addi- tion of device drivers to your DOS configuration in order to access the devices in question.  Virtually every DOS-based computer system needs to work with device drivers at some point, unless it’s using an extremely simple hardware configuration. Spending some time familiarizing yourself with this important topic can help you save time when you need to add or manage various device drivers in your system.  DOS contains only rudimentary support for computer hardware. For example, DOS can work with standard VGA video cards, basic IDE hard disks, floppy disk drives, text-mode printers, keyboards, and that’s about it. To use other types of hardware usually requires the installation and configuration of a device driver for the device in question. Device drivers enable the following types of devices to work with DOS:    CD-ROM   Mouse or trackball   Tape backup   Video cards   Sound cards   Network cards   Other nonstandard storage devices, such as Zip and Jaz drives  DOS itself can work with printers in only the simplest possible way: It can send text-only information to a printer that can accept that type of information. This means that, just using DOS, you can print only plain text. Other printer features, such as boldface, underline, or even graphics, require an application that uses an application-specific printer driver that cannot be shared with other applications.  Under DOS, you can direct text output to a printer in several ways. You can press the Print Screen key to send a copy of what’s on the screen to the printer. You can copy a text file to the printer by using the command COPY filename.ext PRN: and then pressing Enter. You can also use DOS redirection to do the same thing, with the command TYPE  filename.ext >PRN:.  For serial printers, see Chapter 13, “Controlling Devices,” on use of the MODE command, which is usually required with serial-port printers.  You might be wondering why you don’t see printers and modems in the preceding list. Note that there are two distinct types of device drivers. The first kind—the kind you usually hear about—enables DOS itself to interact with and manage a particular device, such as a CD- ROM drive. When DOS can access and manage a device through the use of a device driver, applications can then make use of the device, too, through DOS.   Understanding Device Drivers  309  Understanding Hardware Interrupts  The second kind of device driver, an application-specific device driver, supports a specific  application program that needs to work with a device. For example, WordPerfect for DOS includes its own printer device drivers to allow it to work properly with different printers. The printer device drivers that WordPerfect uses are installed in WordPerfect itself and do not benefit or work with any other application. As another example, most communications programs under DOS either include their own modem device drivers, or they allow fine control of a number of settings that enable them to work with different modems.  To understand device drivers and how they are configured, you first need to understand some basics about standard PC architecture and how DOS works with both application  programs and devices to accomplish its work. You also need to understand how the devices themselves interact with the computer because many devices require that you determine and set their hardware interrupt, DMA channel, and memory address manually. The following sections discuss this information.  You have no doubt heard about hardware interrupts, also called IRQs, inside your computer. All PCs are built so that devices that are part of the computer communicate with the proces- sor through the use of these hardware interrupts. A hardware interrupt enables a device, such as your keyboard, to send a signal to the processor indicating that the device requires the processor’s attention. When the processor receives a signal on one of these interrupts, it branches to a region of memory that contains the program that handles the device itself. For example, every time you press a key on your keyboard, an interrupt is generated for your processor. The processor then finds the program that corresponds to the interrupt, which  in turn handles whatever the device needs. In the case of a key being pressed, the program reads which key was pressed from the keyboard and then sends the information to DOS so that DOS or a running application program can display the key on the screen or do whatev- er else was intended.  All PCs have 16 hardware interrupts, and unfortunately this number cannot be expanded. The 16 interrupts are arranged in two banks of 8 interrupts, with the second bank being connected to the first bank through interrupts 2 and 9. Because interrupts 2 and 9 link the two banks together, you generally don’t want to use these interrupts for any devices in the system  although there are rare exceptions to this rule .  Hardware interrupts in most PCs are edge-sensitive, meaning that the system measures sim- ply whether the interrupt signal is on or off. In some systems, particularly those that use either the EISA or MCA  microchannel  buses, interrupts are level-sensitive, meaning that  an individual interrupt signal can be set to one of several different levels. The idea behind level-sensitive interrupts is that, in theory, multiple devices can share an interrupt, with each device using a different level for its communication. However, in practice, this doesn’t work very well, and so most buses stick with edge-sensitive interrupts.  IRQ assignments can be shared between devices but never between devices that will be used at the same time. For example, if a computer has an interrupt set for one of its communica- tion ports connected to a modem, it also might be capable of using the same interrupt  Part III Ch 12   310  Chapter 12 Using Peripherals  assignment for a tape backup device, provided that the tape backup device is never used while the modem is being used. Another way this works is for systems that have multiple serial devices installed in them. For example, imagine that a computer has a serial mouse connected to COM1  IRQ 4  and a modem connected to COM2  IRQ 3 . If another serial device is installed as COM3, it is usually assigned to the same IRQ number as COM1. This also means that the additional device can’t be used at the same time as the mouse  which probably means that it can never be used because most mouse devices are active all the time . Instead, in this type of circumstance, you are better off placing the modem on COM1, the mouse on COM2, and the third device on COM3, with the understanding that the third device cannot be used while the modem is in use.  You need to be familiar with some standard IRQ assignments. Note that some of them might be different in a particular PC, depending on the extra equipment provided from the manufacturer and which IRQ is assigned to each device. However, for most systems, the interrupt assignments listed in Table 12.1 are correct for the basic hardware devices.  Table 12.1  Standard Hardware Interrupt  IRQ  Assignments  IRQ 0  Assignment System timer  Parallel port 2  LPT2   but often used for sound cards because most systems don’t have an installed LPT2: port   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  Keyboard controller  Connected to second bank at IRQ 9  Serial port 2  COM2,4   Serial port 1  COM1,3   Disk drive controller  Parallel port 1  LPT1   Real-time clock  Connected to first bank at IRQ 2  Unused  Unused  can often be used for a network card   Mouse controller  Math coprocessor  Hard disk controller  Unused  can often be used for secondary hard disk controller   What’s a Software Interrupt? Two kinds of interrupts are referred to with PCs and with DOS. You’ve just learned about hardware interrupts, often abbreviated as IRQs  Interrupt Requests . There are also, however, software interrupts, which are used by applications to communicate with DOS and with the computer’s basic input output system  BIOS .   Understanding Device Drivers  311  Software interrupts are used only by software programmers. They provide hundreds of different functions for application programs, from displaying text on the screen to opening a file on a disk drive to getting the current time from the computer’s clock for use in the application.  Software interrupts are usually abbreviated with the letters Int and usually followed by a hexadecimal number. For instance, the main interrupt used by a program to communicate with DOS is called Int 21H.  You don’t need to do anything with software interrupts, but you do need to know what they are so that you don’t get them confused with hardware interrupts.  Virtually every card you install in the computer requires that you set its IRQ. Often, add-on cards come with special software that can do this job for you, and they also help you deter- mine which IRQs might be free for the cards to use. Other cards provide only a bank of switches or jumpers on the cards to set this information, and it’s up to you to determine which IRQ is free for the cards and to make sure that the system and new device work prop- erly with the chosen IRQ.  Understanding Direct Memory Access  DMA  Channels  Many devices need to transfer large amounts of data to or from the computer’s memory. To free the computer’s processor from needing to perform these transfers for devices with large data-transfer needs  such as hard disk controllers, video cards, and network cards , the PC architecture includes a chip called a Direct Memory Access Controller, or DMA Controller. The DMA controller can transfer memory from one place in the computer to another mem- ory address, without using the processor to do the work. The DMA controller is told where the source address of the data to be transferred is, where the destination address is, and how much to transfer. The processor is then relieved from doing the actual work, and the DMA controller takes care of moving the data from one place to another.  It also does so more rapidly than the processor usually can.  The PC has a total of eight DMA channels, and these DMA channels cannot be shared among devices that use them. Moreover, different DMA channels have either 8- or 16-bit transfer capabilities, and devices usually require one or the other. Table 12.2 lists the standard DMA channels in a PC and their usual assign- ments.  Part III Ch 12  Table 12.2  Standard PC DMA Assignments  DMA 0  Assignment Available  Size 8-bit  8-bit  8-bit  8-bit  16-bit  16-bit  16-bit  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  Available  can be used for network cards   Floppy disk controller  Available  can be used for enhanced parallel ports EPP or ECP   Unavailable  used for memory refresh   Available  Available  Available  can be used for hard disk controllers    312  Chapter 12 Using Peripherals  DMA channels are sometimes abbreviated as DRQs.  Four common devices make use of the DMA controller and require that a particular DMA channel be assigned to them. These devices are the floppy disk drive  assigned to DMA channel 2 , the hard disk controller, the video card, and any installed network cards. In the last three cases, the devices might or might not use DMAs; it’s up to the designers of the cards. In newer PCs, these devices do not use DMAs, whereas older computers  80486- based and earlier  often use versions of these devices that do use DMAs.  Most add-on cards that use a DMA channel offer a default setting that works most often. However, if the device isn’t functioning correctly, you might have to try one of the other possible DMA channels available on that particular card.  Understanding Memory Input Output Addresses  Programs cannot send data to or receive data from devices connected to the computer directly. Instead, small portions of memory are set aside into which programs  and DOS  place information destined for a device, and vice versa. These areas of memory are called I O port addresses  I O being short for Input Output . These memory spaces cannot be shared, nor can they overlap each other.  Most devices you install into the computer require an I O port address be assigned to them. Often, the default setting from the manufacturer works, although usually alternative addresses also are provided in case of conflict. Most device drivers also need this informa- tion to properly interact with the device itself.  Setting Up Device Drivers  As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, device drivers are memory-resident programs that enable DOS and application programs to interact with certain devices in the computer. Device drivers are generally set up in DOS through a statement in the system’s CONFIG.SYS file. In rare cases, a device driver might be loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file instead. Most device drivers use the .SYS extension.  Device drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file are loaded through either the DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= statements. The former loads the device driver into conventional memory, whereas the lat- ter attempts to load the device driver into extended memory. Most device drivers function well either way, although in rare cases, a device driver might work properly only in conven- tional memory. Aside from this, though, whether they are located in conventional or extend- ed memory is determined by the overall memory tuning for the system, which is discussed in Chapter 19, “Configuring Your Computer.”  Device drivers loaded in AUTOEXEC.BAT are placed into conventional memory unless you use the LOADHIGH command to start them.   Setting Up Device Drivers  313  Two device drivers that most DOS systems load, regardless of what peripherals they have loaded, are HIMEM and EMM386. They are both loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file, and they provide additional memory management services for DOS  in this case, you might think of the sys- tem’s RAM as a device . Following is an example of how these two lines usually appear in the CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS  DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM  As you can see, the actual device driver files can be located anywhere on the computer sys- tem, and the DEVICE command accepts drive letters and directories so that they can be locat- ed and loaded.  Sometimes you need to set up boot disks for different configurations on a system. For instance, some computer games require that only the minimum possible device drivers be loaded to provide the game with enough conventional memory and reduce potential con- flicts in the system. If you use boot disks to boot DOS with different configurations, you can dramatically improve your boot time by making sure that any needed device drivers are located on the system’s hard disk and that the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files properly reference the device drivers. This way, the system can boot much more quickly than if it had to load the device drivers from the disk itself.  Many device drivers require that the chosen IRQ, DMA, and I O port addresses be set as part of the device driver load command. A good example is the device driver for supporting a Sound Blaster audio card. The following command is used, for example, for a Sound Blaster 16: DEVICE=C:\SB16\DRV\CTSB16.SYS  UNIT=0  BLASTER=A:220 I:5 D:1 H:5  The first part of the DEVICE= statement simply locates and loads the device driver. The next portion of the statement is the  UNIT parameter, which in this case indicates that this is the first installed Sound Blaster. Next comes the  BLASTER parameter, which indicates what resources in the system the card can use. Each resource is identified with a letter, followed by a colon and the chosen setting. The A parameter sets the memory address for the card, and the I parameter sets the IRQ used  often, IRQ 5 is used for sound cards because most systems don’t have an LPT2 port, so that IRQ is available . The D and H parameters set the two DMA channels that the card is to use—1 and 5, respectively  the Sound Blaster 16 uses both an 8- and 16-bit DMA channel .  Unfortunately, every device driver requires different parameters and uses a different syntax to specify any needed options. For each device driver you use, you need to examine the doc- umentation that came with the device for the proper syntax to use when loading the device driver.  Part III Ch 12   314  Chapter 12 Using Peripherals  Troubleshooting Device Drivers  Generally, you might have problems with a device driver when you install it for the first time, although occasional difficulties can emerge over time if it is incompatible with, say,  a new program or an additional device.  If you are having trouble getting a device driver to work initially, you should first suspect a conflict in the device’s IRQ, DMA, or I O memory setting. Depending on the device itself, different conflicts might manifest in different ways. For example, skipping sound coming from a sound card often indicates an IRQ conflict.  If the documentation that came with the device offers no clues on how to determine which resource is conflicting, you will likely have to pursue a trial-and-error approach to changing the settings.  Many versions of DOS come with a program called Microsoft Diagnostics  MSD.EXE  that can help you determine which IRQs are free in your computer. Similarly, some utility pro- grams such as Norton Utilities for DOS also can show you this information, as well as information on what I O port addresses are in use, and sometimes which DMA channels  are in use.  Another route you can take when troubleshooting a new device driver is to disable all other device drivers. You do so by editing the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from which  the system boots. You place the keyword REM  followed by a space  in front of any lines in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT that load device drivers. The keyword REM stands for remark and indicates to DOS that the rest of that particular line is to be ignored. After “remarking out” the other device drivers, you reboot the computer to make the changes take effect. The idea here is to simply see whether you can get the device to function properly with a mini- mal system. If so, you can proceed in a stepwise fashion to re-enable the other device drivers until you find the one that conflicts, and then you will probably have enough information to resolve the conflict.  You re-enable a device by removing the REM from the front of its line in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT and rebooting . If you cannot get a device to work even in a minimal system, even after trying a number of alternative settings, the device might not be working or it might have some kind of hardware incompatibility. In this case, contact the manufacturer of either the device or the computer system for further assistance.  For example, consider the following case: You have a system that contains two COM ports  COM1 and COM2  with a modem on COM1, a mouse on COM2, a sound card, a printer on a parallel port, and a CD-ROM drive. You have just installed a network card into the sys- tem, and the first time you try to initialize it, the mouse on COM2 stops working, and the new network card doesn’t work at all. How do you go about resolving this  unfortunately all-too-common  problem?  You probably suspect some kind of conflict because not only does the network card not function but neither does the mouse. If just the new network card doesn’t work, but every- thing else is fine, you probably suspect a configuration problem of some kind or a broken network card, but not necessarily a conflict with another device. Because you’re dealing with   Troubleshooting Device Drivers  315  a conflict  and assuming that no troubleshooting tools are available for either device to tell you what the problem is , you then proceed to find out whether you can make the network card work if you disable the mouse. To do so, you look in both CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to find the device driver that controls the mouse  it can be in either place  for mouse devices , add REM to the start of its line, and then reboot the computer.  After taking these steps, you discover that the network card starts working. This is good news because you’ve now proven that the card works, and you’ve confirmed that you have a conflict with the mouse. If you have any doubt, you can remove the network card or its dri- vers and see whether the mouse starts working. If so, you’ve pretty much proven that you have a conflict.  Now the question becomes, what is conflicting? Is it an IRQ, DMA channel, or a memory I O port? Here, experience really pays off because over time you develop knowledge of the most likely conflict for any given device. However, as a general rule, you should always sus- pect the IRQ first—that’s where most conflicts occur. Looking at the IRQ table  refer to Table 12.1 , you see that the COM2 port, which the mouse uses, makes use of IRQ 3. Looking through the documentation for the network card, you find that its default IRQ  is also IRQ 3. Eureka!  Always remember that manufacturer Web sites can be invaluable resources to troubleshoot and resolve device problems. Usually, they have notes, FAQs, and updated drivers that might resolve your problem. Also, don’t forget to check the Web site of the company that made the computer because the manufacturer can also have specific fixes for some devices that, for some reason, conflict only on its computers. For example, when I was beta testing Windows NT 4, I never got it to communicate with the serial ports on my main computer. I figured the problem was a bug that would get resolved before NT was released. Well, when I loaded the released version, it had the same problem! Two weeks later, the maker of the computer I was using came up with an update to its BIOS that resolved the problem because Windows NT had changed how it communicated with serial ports in some  basic way.  Part III Ch 12  Now that you’ve guessed that the conflict is on IRQ 3, you can do one of two things:    You can change the network card’s IRQ to another IRQ number.  Most network cards work best on IRQs 10, 11, or 12. If those choices aren’t available, try IRQ 5.    You can’t easily change the IRQs for COM ports, so you can’t change the mouse’s  COM2 IRQ to something else. However, you might consider changing from a serial mouse that requires a COM port to something called a bus mouse that uses its own interface card in the computer  and uses different interrupts from serial mouse devices, too .   316  Chapter 12 Using Peripherals  You use the same process to work through other types of conflicts, but if changing a device’s IRQ doesn’t work, you might have to try changing the I O port address or, if the device uses DMA, its DMA channel.  The following are some general tips for different types of devices that you might have trou- ble with:    Some systems have add-on serial port cards instead of  or in addition to  built-in serial ports. These cards usually enable you to change the IRQs used for those add-on serial ports. However, be reluctant in changing them because many application programs don’t work properly with a COM port that isn’t on a standard COM port IRQ.    Some video cards use an extra IRQ. The features that require it aren’t very important to the functioning of most software, and you can disable a video card’s additional IRQ use.   CD-ROM drives rely on at least two device drivers to function. The first, which is usu- ally part of CONFIG.SYS, initializes the card that connects to the CD-ROM drive.  Often, it is a driver with ASPI in its name, but not always.  Secondarily, a device driver called MSCDEX.EXE  Microsoft CD Extensions  is required in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The driver in CONFIG.SYS probably requires IRQ, I O, and DMA assignments, whereas MSCDEX relies on other settings that tell it the name of the device defined in CONFIG.SYS, the drive letter to use, and some other features that can improve CD-ROM performance. Make sure that the parameters to both the CD-ROM device driver and MSCDEX are cor- rect per the manual that came with the CD-ROM and CD-ROM interface card.    Parallel printers don’t rely on DOS device drivers. It is up to each application to work with the printer properly. However, serial-based printers can require that you run the DOS MODE command to properly set the system’s COM port to work with the printer. You use the MODE command to set the COM port’s baud rate, number of data bits, pari- ty, and number of stop bits, and these settings must correspond to switch-based settings on the printer itself. See Chapter 13 for details on using the MODE command.    Modems also do not rely on device drivers, but they are subject to IRQ conflicts with other devices that probably use device drivers. If a modem isn’t working properly, sus- pect an IRQ conflict with the COM port that the modem uses. Also, check the specific settings in the communications program you are using, making sure that it’s set to use the right COM port and that the baud rate is supported by the modem.  Solving device conflicts can, at times, be a frustrating task, and working through all the pos- sible issues takes patience. However, keep in mind that you need to perform all changes and tests in a controlled, stepwise fashion, and use the information presented in this chapter to help you understand possible sources of trouble and ways of dealing with various device problems that might crop up. If you do so, and remember to involve any appropriate manu- facturers or vendors and take advantage of the help they can give, you can sort out device problems in short order.

This chapter dis- cusses the commands that control the devices connected to your computer. You use these commands to redirect input and output, select alternative keyboards, and print graphics and text files.  DOS supplies many different commands to help you interact with devices. With three com- mands referred to as filters, DOS is responsible for channeling information between devices. You can use these filters—MORE, FIND, and SORT—to modify information as it passes from files to the screen. Table 13.1 lists and explains the functions of the commands and filters discussed in this chapter.  Table 13.1 Device Control Commands and Filters  Function Clears the screen  Prints graphics screens  Prints in the background  Selects a different console; makes the serial port the console  Controls device operations; redirects a parallel port to a serial port; changes the typematic rate  Filter to control the display of text  Filter to find strings of text  Filter to sort information  Table 13.2 lists and explains the functions of the redirection operators you use in conjunc- tion with the device control commands and filters.  Table 13.2 Redirection Operators  Operators  Function Redirects a command’s input  Redirects a command’s output  Redirects a command’s output and appends the output to the target, if one exists  Passes the output from one command to another as input  Command  CLS  GRAPHICS  PRINT  CTTY  MODE  MORE  FIND  SORT  <  >    >>   The GRAPHICS Command  319  The CLS Command  The internal command CLS clears the screen, removing all visible text. CLS then displays the prompt so that you can continue to issue DOS commands. This command clears only the onscreen display. If your system uses two screens, CLS clears only the active display, not both screens.  The CLS command, which has no switches, uses the following syntax: CLS  Clearing the screen does not change the display mode. If, for example, you used the MODE command to change your screen display to 40 columns, the screen is cleared when you issue the CLS command; CLS then redisplays the DOS prompt in 40-column mode. All other attributes that you set previously—for example, if you defined a background color and fore- ground color by using ANSI.SYS escape sequences—are also retained.  You can frequently use the CLS command in batch files. By inserting a CLS command at the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, for instance, you can remove all the messages that memory-resident programs might display as they load into your system.  The GRAPHICS Command  You might have tried to use the Print Screen key  PrtSc on some keyboards  to print the contents of your screen to a printer. If so, you might have discovered that this key works properly only when your screen is in text mode.  If your monitor is a CGA, EGA, or VGA display, the external command GRAPHICS enables you to use the Print Screen key to print graphics screens, also. When you execute GRAPHICS, a portion of the program remains memory-resident. When you next press Print Screen, all ASCII code characters that would otherwise print as text are converted to graphics before the information is sent to the printer.  Issuing the GRAPHICS Command  Use the following syntax for the GRAPHICS command: GRAPHICS printer [drive]:path\filename  R  B  LCD  PRINTBOX:STD  printer is the type of printer you are using. Table 13.3 lists the values you can use for the printer parameter. If your printer is not listed, it might be compatible with one of the other printers on the list. Refer to your printer’s instruction manual for details. If you do not spec- ify a printer, DOS assumes the GRAPHICS printer type.

This file supports the printers of other manufacturers. If your printer doesn’t fit into one of the categories supported by GRAPHICS, you can create a custom printer profile for use with GRAPHICS. The \filename parameter refers to the profile file, which specifies how graphics are translated for various printers. The profile file is an ASCII text file with two types of information for each printer in the file. A profile can include information about how the printer is controlled, such as selecting printer colors or adjusting the darkness of the printed piece. The second section of the pro- file lists the translation from the screen to the printer.   R forces the printer to print a monochrome text screen as you see it—black background and white text. When you use the  R switch with a color screen, the darkest colors  black or blue  print as black, light colors appear as white or light gray, and other colors print as dif- ferent shades of gray on a grayscale for contrast. If you don’t use the  R switch, all onscreen information that is white prints as black, and all black onscreen information  usually the background  prints as white. The paper color in the printer is assumed to be white.   The GRAPHICS Command  321   B prints the background color. Use this switch only if you have a color printer and after you specify COLOR4 or COLOR8 as your printer type. If you try to use the  B switch with a black- and-white printer, DOS displays the following message: The  B switch is invalid with black and white printers.   LCD is a switch designed for use with the IBM PC-Convertible, which comes with a small liquid-crystal display  LCD  screen.  LCD forces the printer to print the screen as it appears, with the size of the screen and characters smaller than on normal monitors. You also can use this switch with any other laptop computer that has an old-style, smaller LCD screen like the IBM PC-Convertible. Most laptops now have a full-sized LCD screen and don’t require the use of this switch.   PRINTBOX:STD sets the printbox size to standard or normal size, as it appears on mono- chrome and VGA monitors of standard size and shape. You use this setting to print the screen when you work with Quattro Pro, Microsoft Word, or other programs in graphics mode. You also use this setting to print the contents of a narrow LCD screen if you want it to appear as if it were on a standard monitor. By typing  PRINTBOX:LCD, you can use this switch to force the printer to print in LCD mode  a longer form of the  LCD switch, shown earlier . You can abbreviate the  PRINTBOX switch to  PB.  Using GRAPHICS to Print a Screen Image  Suppose that you have an IBM ProPrinter printer. If you use a monochrome system and want to print a screen image with the background as black and the text as white, enter the following command at the DOS prompt: GRAPHICS  R  After GRAPHICS loads into memory, you can create the screen of interest and press Print Screen to print to the printer.  To print eight-color images  including the background color  on an IBM PC Color Printer with a CMY ribbon installed, type the following command: GRAPHICS COLOR8  B  On the PC-Convertible with an attached full-sized monitor, you can send the screen image to the IBM PC-Convertible thermal printer by typing the following: GRAPHICS THERMAL  PB:STD  Changing the command to either of the following prints the image as it normally appears on the liquid-crystal display: GRAPHICS THERMAL  PB:LCD  GRAPHICS THERMAL  LCD  You should remember the following guidelines when using the GRAPHICS command:    After you load GRAPHICS, you can press the Print Screen  Shift+PrtSc  key to print  graphics screens on listed graphics printers.  Part III Ch 13   322  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices    If you omit the  PB and  LCD switches, GRAPHICS uses the previous printbox setting.   You can print up to eight colors on a color printer.   You can print up to 19 shades of gray on a black-and-white printer.  The PRINT Command  In Chapter 8, ”Managing Your Files,” you learned that the COPY command can transfer information from one device to another. For example, this command copies the file named LETTER.TXT to the device PRN, the printer: COPY LETTER.TXT PRN  During this copying process, the computer is not available for other use. Copying a large file to the printer can tie up your computer for a great while, depending on the speed of your printer.  You can make better use of your computer if you use the PRINT command. This command enables you to print in the background, thereby freeing up your computer for other tasks while you print a document. Printing occurs during the idle times—while the computer is waiting for you to type at the keyboard, for example. You also can queue files, which means send multiple files to the printer, each of which then prints in turn.  Issuing the PRINT Command  The external PRINT command uses the following syntax: PRINT   filename1  P  T  C filename2  P  T  C...  You can replace   with any of the switches listed in Table 13.4. filename1 is the drive, path, and filename of the first file you want to print, and filename2 is the drive, path, and filename of the next file you want to print. The ellipsis  …  means that you can list more files. You also can use wildcards in the filenames.  Table 13.4  Switches for the PRINT Command  Switch   D:device   Q:qsize   B:size  Meaning Names the serial or parallel port to which your output device is attached. Acceptable values include all DOS output devices and ports, such as LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, PRN, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, or AUX.  Specifies the maximum number of files—from 4 to 32—that can be queued at a time. If you omit the switch, the default queue size is 10 files.  Determines the size of buffer used in the printing process. The data for printing is taken from the disk in chunks the size of the specified buffer. Increasing the buffer size causes the PRINT command to read data from the disk in bigger chunks. The minimum buffer size is 512 bytes; the maximum is 16KB. If you don’t specify the buffer size, the default size is 512 bytes. Remember that the larger you make the buffer, the less RAM you have for running applications programs.   The PRINT Command  323  Table 13.4 Continued  Switch   U:ticks1   M:ticks2   S:ticks3  Meaning Determines how long  in system clock ticks  the PRINT command waits for the printer to be available. In most cases, the PRINT command sends data to the printer faster than the printer can actually print. When the printer cannot accept any more data, it sends a busy signal to the comput- er until it is ready to accept more data. The default setting for  U:ticks1 is 1 clock tick, but you can set it as high as 255. If the printer is busy, PRINT waits the number of clock ticks set by this switch. If the printer is still busy, PRINT immediately transfers control back to DOS for other tasks without using the rest of the clock ticks set aside for it by the  S:ticks3 switch.  Specifies the number of system clock ticks that the PRINT command waits for the printer to print a character. You can set ticks2 to any value between 1 and 255; the default value is 2.  Determines the number of clock ticks allocated to background printing. Too high a value for this switch causes the computer to respond sluggishly to other commands that you execute while you print in the background. A low value slows the printing process. The range of values is 1 to 255; the default value is 8.  Like GRAPHICS, PRINT leaves a portion of itself in memory after you issue the command, and the switches change how the PRINT command works. You can specify the optional switches in Table 13.4 only when you first issue the PRINT command. The other switches  issued after the filenames  can be issued at any time, however:    The  P switch places a file in PRINT’s queue. The preceding file and all subsequent files  on the command line are printed.    The  C switch cancels the printing of some files. The filename issued before the  C and all files after the  C on the same command line are removed from the print queue.  The printer alarm sounds if you cancel the currently printing file with the  C switch.  You must issue the  P switch to add files to the queue again.    The  T switch terminates printing. All files are removed from the queue, including the file being printed. The printer alarm sounds, a file cancellation message prints, and the paper advances to the next page.  If you enter filenames without a  P,  C, or  T switch, DOS uses the  P switch as a default so that all files are placed in the queue for printing. If, at the prompt, you type PRINT with no switches, a list of all files in the queue appears. This list includes the name of the file that is currently printing and the order of files yet to print. This command also displays any error messages. If, for example, you forget to turn on the printer, the following error message appears: Errors on list device indicate that it may be off-line. Please check it.  Part III Ch 13   324  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices  Using PRINT to Print Several Files  You do not have to enter the names of all the files to print at one time. You can issue the PRINT command several times to add or remove files from the print queue. You can specify the parameters that affect the way PRINT operates  those in Table 13.4 , however, only when you first issue the command. After you first issue the PRINT command, you use the command only to enter filenames for printing or to cancel printing.  If you enter the PRINT command for the first time without specifying a device, PRINT prompts you for a device name. The default, PRN, is the first parallel port  LPT1  on your computer. Pressing Enter at the DOS prompt accepts the default.  If you are in no hurry to collect the printed output of files and want to use the computer while the printer prints your files, you can readjust the default installation settings for PRINT. By changing the  M:ticks2 or  S:ticks3 settings, you can give your computer better response time. To alter the default settings, you can type the following when you invoke  the PRINT command for the first time: PRINT  D:PRN  M:1  S:25  If you are unconcerned about the sluggishness of the keyboard, you can improve the speed of the background printing by altering the buffer size, as well as by adjusting  M:ticks2 and  S:ticks3. You might type the following command, for example: PRINT  D:PRN  B:16384  M:1  S:25  Experiment with these variables until you find a setting that is acceptable. A sluggish key- board is not always tolerable. If the response time is too slow, you can make errors; for example, you might assume that a program didn’t accept your keystrokes and try to retype the command, whereas the program was only waiting to regain control.  By using a combination of the  P,  T, and  C switches, you can adjust the order in which the files print. Suppose, for example, that you want to print four files: LETTER1.TXT, MEMO1.TXT, REPORT1.TXT, and REPORT2.TXT. Type the following on the command line: PRINT  D:PRN LETTER1.TXT  P MEMO1.TXT REPORT1.TXT REPORT2.TXT  If you then decide that you want to print REPORT2.TXT before REPORT1.TXT, type the follow- ing command, which removes REPORT1.TXT from the print queue and adds the file to the end of the queue: PRINT REPORT1.TXT  C REPORT1.TXT  P  You can cancel all files to be printed by typing the following command: PRINT  T  General Rules for Using PRINT  As you are using PRINT, you should keep the following guidelines in mind:    You can specify the  D:device,  Q:qsize,  B:size,  S:ticks3,  U:ticks1, and  M:ticks2  optional switches only the first time that you issue the PRINT command.   The CTTY Command  325    If you specify  D:device, you must type this switch first, before all other switches.   If you issue  P, the preceding file and all subsequent files entered on the command line  by the PRINT command print until a  T or  C switch is issued.    If you issue  C, the preceding file and all subsequent files are canceled.   The files print in the order that you enter them at the command line.   A page-eject sequence is sent to the printer at the end of each file.   You cannot use the printer for other purposes while PRINT is in operation. You cannot,  for example, use Print Screen when PRINT is in effect.    The files being printed must be on the same disk drive.   You cannot alter files that are in the print queue or being printed.   Specifying a nonexistent device causes unpredictable behavior by the computer.   Tab characters in the printed file convert to blanks, up to the next 8-column boundary.  GRAPHICS.PRO is the profile file supplied with DOS. If you want to create a custom profile file for your printer, make a copy of the supplied GRAPHICS.PRO file and modify it.  This exercise is also useful if you are interested in DOS programming. Modifying the GRAPHICS.PRO file is not necessary for most printers.  If the onscreen colors don’t have a sharp enough contrast, the GRAPHICS command can “miss” the difference between colors and produce an all-white or all-black printout. If this problem occurs, try altering your screen colors before you print.  The CTTY Command  DOS can take information or data from and send it to different kinds of devices. Any device that you can use to give information to DOS is called an input device, and any device DOS can send information to is an output device. DOS uses your keyboard and screen as the stan- dard input and output devices. Together, these two devices make up the console, known to DOS as the CON device. The internal command CTTY enables you to tell DOS that you want to use a different device for input and later enables you to restore the keyboard and screen as the console.  Use one of these syntax lines for the internal command CTTY: CTTY device  CTTY CON  device is the name of a DOS device that you can use for input. CTTY causes DOS to inter- cept the input output  I O  requests that normally come from the keyboard and go to the screen; the command redirects these calls to the device you specify.  By typing the following command, for example, you designate COM1 as the device that sends and receives standard input and output: CTTY COM1  Part III Ch 13   326  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices  You use this command in association with specialized programs that need input from a  different source from the keyboard. Later, typing the following from the auxiliary device restores the console to the keyboard and display: CTTY CON  You also can use CTTY if the computer is attached to an intelligent bar-code reader that col- lects information from packages. This reader, in association with a specialized program, might not need to use the display or keyboard.  You probably will not need to use the CTTY command. DOS usually can gather information through alternative devices without altering the standard input and output devices. Certain applications programs, however, benefit from your use of CTTY. One example is the DOS external program Interlnk, which requires the CTTY command in order to transfer itself to another computer.   ➔ For more information on the Interlnk program, see Chapter 8, “Managing Your Files.”  If you decide that you need to use CTTY, keep the following rules in mind:    You can use the character-based devices AUX, COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4 as  the alternative console.    The physical device attached to the relevant AUX, COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4  must be able to accept input and provide output.    Programs that do not use DOS function calls cannot make use of the alternative   console.  The MODE Command  MODE is one of the more versatile external commands supplied with DOS. It sets the opera- tional modes of serial and parallel ports and redirects information from parallel ports to seri- al ports. MODE also can set display modes, and you can use MODE with code pages.  ➔ For more information about display modes and code pages, see Chapter 11, “Controlling Your  Environment,” p. 293, and Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS,” p. 339. In this chapter, you learn how you can use the MODE command to control the parallel and serial ports, as well as to change how the keyboard acts. To read about all functions of the MODE command, turn to the “Command Reference” later in this book.  Using MODE to Change Parallel Port Settings  A parallel port transmits data by transferring an entire byte at one time. Because of the way data is transferred, parallel ports are typically used to send information to a printer. To help control your printer, you can use the MODE command to adjust the number of lines per inch and columns per line on your printer and to set the retry feature.   The MODE Command  327  Issuing the MODE Command Use the following syntax for the external MODE command, which changes the parallel printer characteristics: MODE LPTn: cpl,lpi, P  LPTn: is the parallel port name, such as LPT1 or LPT2. cpl is the number of characters per line; the default cpl setting is 80. lpi is the number of lines per inch; the default setting for lpi is 6. P specifies continuous retries on timeout or “busy” errors.  MODE also enables you to use an alternative format, as follows: MODE LPTn: COLS=wid, LINES=lpi, RETRY=action  wid is the number of columns per line, 80 or 132; lpi is the number of lines per inch, 6 or 8; and action is the message you want DOS to return or the action DOS should take when the printer port is busy.  When you use the MODE command to adjust the parallel port settings, this command alters only two items seen on the printout itself: the characters per line and lines per inch. In gen- eral, printing is performed directly from an applications program, which can set many more parameters for a particular printer. The MODE command operates by sending Escape sequences to the printer that can adjust the printed output accordingly.  The RETRY setting is more significant than the other settings. When data is sent to the print- er, the port expects to see return signals from the printer indicating that it received the data. If the port doesn’t receive any signals within a particular period of time, a timeout error occurs. By default, DOS does not try to send information to the printer again and returns an error message to the screen. If you include the P option, DOS continuously tries to send the data; this action prevents the error message from being displayed. Pressing the Ctrl+Break key combination stops the retry process.  If you use the RETRY switch in the alternative MODE format, various retry options are available. If you don’t specify a retry option, DOS doesn’t continue trying to send data when a time- out error occurs. When you use the retry option, you can select from several options. The following list explains the various options:    The B setting returns a busy signal to the device driver when the port is busy. This set-  ting is not available with DOS 6.0.    The R setting causes a ready signal to be returned from the port—even if the port is  busy. Then, when the printer does become ready, the data is ready to send, and an error message does not appear onscreen.    The E option is most commonly used when the printing is done in the background  by  PRINT or a network print queue . The data is not transferred to the printer until the port is not busy.    The N setting indicates that no retry action is taken.   The P option causes DOS to try the printer continuously until the busy state ends.  Part III Ch 13   328  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices  Using MODE to Print a Large File In some cases, you must use the P option to print a file. Consider a large DOS file that you want to copy to the printer. If the file is larger than the storage capacity of the printer, the printer port will be busy at some point during the data transfer. If the printer remains busy for too long, an error message appears onscreen; DOS thinks the printer is defective, and the printing process aborts. This outcome is a particular concern when you are printing large, complex files such as those created by a PostScript program.  Specifying P in DOS 3.3 and earlier or RETRY=B in DOS 4.0 and 5.0 causes DOS to wait until the printer is ready to receive data.  The B option is not available in DOS 6.0, but you can use the P option for this purpose.  Use the following command for LPT1 in DOS 3.3: MODE LPT1:,,P  For DOS 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, and 6.2, use the following command: MODE LPT1 RETRY=B  For DOS 6.0 or 6.2, use the following command: MODE LPT1 RETRY=P  If the file is large and you want to be able to fit more lines of text on a page, you can print the file with a higher number of lines per inch  8 instead of 6 . Also, you can specify 132 columns per line instead of 80. This setting is not a problem for a wide-carriage printer, which accepts wide paper. If you are using a printer that accepts 8 1 2-inch paper, however, you must set the printer to print in a condensed character mode, which can fit 132 columns on a line of 8 1 2-inch paper.  When the printer is attached to LPT2, use the following command to fit as much informa- tion as possible on a page: MODE LPT2:132,8  General Rules for Using MODE to Change Parallel Port Settings When you are using the MODE command to change parallel port settings, you should keep the following rules in mind:    The default values of the port will reset if you reset or initialize the printer.   If you omit a parameter from the command line, the setting for that parameter does not    Do not use any of the retry options when printers are being shared on an IBM PC net-  change.  work.  Using MODE to Change Serial Port Settings  You can use another option of the MODE command to alter the functions of the serial ports. This command works in a way similar to the parallel port adjustments. DOS changes the parameters that are sent to and from the device driver.   The MODE Command  329  The acceptable serial ports are COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4. The serial port can receive and transmit data only one bit at a time. The signaling rate  the number of times per second that data is transmitted  is the baud rate. The amount of data transferred in a second is referred to as the bps  bits per second .  You can use the MODE command to adjust the baud settings and change the amount of data sent in a fixed time. Although it is called a baud setting, the numbers used are actually the number of bits transmitted per second. Acceptable baud settings are 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 19200. You need to use only the first two digits of the number to set the baud rate.  The most common devices attached to a serial port that you need to set from DOS are seri- al printers and plotters. Although modems are serial devices, you usually don’t adjust them from DOS. Communications programs, however, use the DOS functions to make adjust- ments to the serial ports.  Use the following syntax to change the serial port: MODE COMy: baud,parity,databits,stopbits,P  The elements of the commands are as follows:    COMy: is the name of the serial port device.   baud is the baud rate. You must specify the baud rate for the serial port.   parity is the parity. Parity is used in error-correction algorithms.   databits is the number of data bits. The default number of data bits is 7.   stopbits is the number of stop bits. Stop bits mark the end of a character being trans- mitted. The default number of stop bits is 1 for all baud rates except 110, when 2 stop bits are set as the default.    P specifies continuous retries on timeout errors.  You also can use the following syntax: MODE COMy: BAUD=baud PARITY=parity DATA=databits STOP=stopbits RETRY=action  All the variables in this version of the MODE command are the same as in the previous ver- sion. The only new one is action, which is the message you want DOS to return when the port is busy.  With versions of DOS before Version 4.0, the retry feature provided two choices when a timeout error occurred: no retry or continuous retries when you included the P option. When data is sent to the printer, the port expects to see signals from the printer indicating that it received the data. If the port doesn’t receive any signals within a particular period of time, a timeout error occurs. By default, DOS does not try again to send information to the printer and returns an error message to the screen. If you include the P option, DOS contin- uously tries to send the data; this action prevents the error message from being displayed. The Ctrl+Break key combination stops the retry process.  Part III Ch 13   330  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices  With DOS 4.0 and later, more retry options are available. If you do not specify a retry option, DOS doesn’t try again to send data when a timeout error occurs. When you use the retry option, you can select from the following four options:    The R setting causes a ready signal to be returned from the port even if the port is busy. Then, when the printer does become ready, the data is ready to send, and an error mes- sage does not appear onscreen.    The E option is most commonly used when you are printing in the background  using  PRINT or a network print queue . The data is not transferred to the printer until the port is not busy.    The N option specifies no action; this setting is the default.   The P action specifies continuous retry.  Using MODE to Set the Serial Port To set the first serial port to communicate at 2400 bps, with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity, you can type one of the following commands: MODE COM1 2400,N,8,1  MODE COM1 24,N,8,1  If you are using DOS 3.3 or later, you can type the following instead to get the same set- tings: MODE COM1 BAUD=24 DATA=8 STOP=1 PARITY=NONE  The printer or plotter needs to be set to receive data in the same format in which the serial port is sending the data—that is, the same baud rate, parity, and so on.  General Rules for Using MODE with Serial Ports When you are using the MODE command to change serial port settings, you should keep the following rules in mind:    If you set a retry option, a portion of MODE remains resident unless you use the DOS 4.0    The retry option slows the performance of foreground tasks when computers are being  RETRY=none option.  shared on an IBM PC network.    DOS 4.0 and later can include Mark or Space parity settings. All versions of DOS sup-  port none, odd, and even parity settings.  Using MODE to Redirect a Parallel Port to a Serial Port  The final MODE setting you can use with ports is the command to redirect a parallel port to a serial port. Typically, you use this setting if you want to redirect printer output to the serial port for use with a plotter or serial printer.   The MODE Command  331  Issuing the MODE Command to Redirect Ports Use the following syntax for the MODE command that changes the parallel printer to a serial printer: MODE LPTn:=COMy:  LPTn: is the name of the parallel printer port, and COMy: is the name of the serial port.  After you use MODE, DOS channels to the serial port all I O requests that a program sends to the parallel port. The electronics associated with the port handle automatically the conver- sion of data from bytewide to bitwide.  Using MODE to Redirect Ports Some early programs don’t directly support serial printers. To use a serial printer, you can set a serial port and redirect a parallel port to that serial port. This process enables you to print when you use a serial printer and also use a program that doesn’t directly support the printer.  Earlier in this chapter, you learned how to initialize a serial port by using the MODE com- mand. For example, you initialize a serial port with DOS 3.3 by using a command similar  to the following: MODE COM2 2400,E,7,2  With DOS 4.0 and later, you can type the following command instead: MODE COM2 BAUD=24 DATA=7 STOP=2 PARITY=EVEN  You then follow the initialization command by typing the following command: MODE LPT1=COM2  All data that normally goes to LPT1 is transmitted to COM2 at 2400 bps, with 7 data bits, 2 stop bits, and even parity.  General Rules for Using MODE to Redirect Ports When you are using the MODE command to redirect ports, you should keep the following rules in mind:    You can redirect any parallel port to any serial port.   You must initialize the serial port with both speed and data characteristics before the  Part III Ch 13    The initialization of the serial port must include the retry option if the attached device  parallel port is redirected.  is a printer.  Using MODE to Change the Typematic Rate  When you press a key on the PC keyboard, a character appears onscreen. If you continue to hold down the key, the pressed character repeats onscreen. The number of times per second the key repeats is known as the typematic rate.   332  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices  The syntax for the MODE command that changes the typematic rate is as follows: MODE CON RATE=rate DELAY=delay  rate is the number of repetitions per second. The rate parameter can have values in the range 1 through 32. These values represent a repeat rate of from 2 to 30 characters per sec- ond  the higher the value, the faster the repeat rate . The default value is 20 for an IBM AT and 21 for an IBM PS 2, which is equivalent to approximately 10 characters per second.  The delay parameter is the time delay before DOS starts repeating a key. The delay is spec- ified in .25-second intervals. The range for the delay is 1 through 4, making a total possible delay of 1 second.  To set the keyboard so that the delay before the key repeats is 0.75 second and the rate value is 24, type the following: MODE CON RATE=24 DELAY=3  Using Redirection Commands  DOS uses three standard devices: one for input, one for output, and one for errors. The main input output device is the console, which is DOS’s name for your keyboard and screen. The keyboard is the standard input device, and the display is the standard output and error device. In short, you type commands on the keyboard, and the commands and any error messages appear onscreen.  DOS enables you to choose the devices that you use to input and output information; this process is called redirection.  Error messages are always sent to the screen.   Issuing the Redirection Operators  The redirection symbols are the greater-than and less-than signs. If you think about it, these symbols look like arrows  > or <  that show the input’s source and destination. Use the fol- lowing syntax for redirecting a program or command’s input: command < inputdevice  The syntax for redirecting a program or command’s output is shown in the following: command > outputdevice  The syntax for redirecting and appending to an existing file is shown in the following: function command >> outputdevice  In each syntax shown here, inputdevice is the source of the input, outputdevice is the desti- nation of the output, and command can specify almost all applications programs or DOS com- mands. With the redirection command, you can use any DOS output device as an outputdevice, and you can use any DOS input device as an inputdevice.  Normally, redirected input comes from a file. Some devices, however, such as a mouse or bar-code reader, can also be used as a source of input. You can write a file that consists of   Using Redirection Commands  333  the keystrokes used to operate a program, for example, or you can use the output from a mouse as the input for a program.  Most DOS users redirect output more often than they redirect input. The two most com- mon places to redirect output are to the printer or to a disk file. The following command, which redirects the output of a directory to the printer, is a common example of redirection: DIR > PRN  When you issue this command, DOS redirects the output  the directory listing itself  to the PRN device instead of sending the listing to the screen. This command produces a hard-copy listing of the directory.  Another common use is redirecting output to a file. To review the statistics of the MEM  C command, for example, type the following command: MEM  C > CLASSIFY.MEM  When you use redirection commands with pipes and filters, discussed later in this chapter, the command becomes even more powerful.  Take care when you use the > operator to send output to a file. If you use > and refer to an existing file, DOS overwrites the existing file with the new output—without warning.  If you want to redirect to the printer a copy of your disk’s directory structure and a list of the files on your hard disk, type the following: TREE C:\  F >PRN  The TREE command does not supply a directory listing that includes file sizes. If you want to create a full listing of all the directories on your hard disk by using redirection to append the output of the command, you specify that each directory be listed and then specify that the output be appended to a file. You then can print the full list. To perform this task, you type  a command similar to the following for each directory: DIR C:\  S >> FULLIST.DIR  The DIR command lists the files in all the directories on drive C. The  S switch causes the DIR command to display all subdirectories. You can then substitute the names of other drives for C.  If you are testing programs that require a large amount of user input, the following redirec- tion method is useful. For example, you can type the following: PROGRAM < C:TESTPAT  This command results in the file TESTPAT supplying the input to PROGRAM. The redirection process enables you to construct a file that contains the correct keystrokes needed to oper- ate a program. You then can test the program’s basic operation before you include the  error-trapping sequences. These sequences handle the situations when the user presses an incorrect key.  Part III Ch 13   334  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices  General Rules for Using Redirection  The following are some helpful rules to know when using redirection:    Do not use redirection on a DOS batch file command line that includes CALL, FOR,   or IF.  the new output.    Using > and referring to an existing file cause DOS to overwrite the existing file with    Using >> adds the output to an existing file or creates a new file if the file does not exist.  The MORE Filter  DOS uses elements called filters to channel information between devices. You can use these filters to modify information as it passes from files to the screen. Filters, which work only on ASCII text files, are often used with the redirection symbols so that input can come from a source other than the keyboard or be sent to a device other than the screen.  Piping is another feature used with these commands. You use the pipe symbol    to send output information that normally goes to the screen as input to another program. Piping, a form of redirection, diverts information destined for a device but then makes the informa- tion become the input from a device to another program.  The MORE filter buffers information from the input device or file and sends the data to the monitor one screen at a time.  Issuing the MORE Filter  The syntax for the MORE filter, which has no switches, is shown in the following: MORE  MORE is commonly used in the following way, where filename is the input file: MORE < filename  Or, it is used in the following way, where command is any command or program: command  MORE  MORE collects—and saves in a temporary disk file—information that normally goes to the screen. When a screen of input is obtained, MORE sends that information to the standard out- put device all at the same time. The text is channeled through the MORE filter until the end- of-file. Press any key when DOS displays the -- More -- prompt; this action displays the next screen. After all the information is displayed onscreen, DOS erases the temporary file created by MORE.  Using MORE to Pause the Screen  When you use MORE to pause directory listings, the filter serves a function similar to the  P switch that is available with the DIR command.   The FIND Filter  335  The most common use of MORE, however, is to pause the TYPE command. To read the con- tents of a README.DOC file one page at a time, for example, type one of the following: TYPE README.DOC  MORE  MORE <README.DOC  Both syntax forms work identically. To see the contents of a file, you can use the TYPE com- mand. If the output of the file flows off the screen, reissue the command by pressing F3, and add the pipe character    and MORE.  General Rules for Using MORE  The following are some helpful rules to know when using MORE:    Do not use MORE alone. MORE is a filter, which requires input to redirect or pipe.   To view additional screens full of information, press any key when DOS displays the   -- More -- prompt.    Ctrl+Break  and Ctrl+C  terminates the command without displaying any other screens.  The FIND Filter  The FIND filter finds ASCII text in files. This filter often is used in association with redirec- tion and piping.  Issuing the FIND Filter  Use the following syntax for the FIND filter: FIND  C  N  V  I “string” filename...  “string” specifies the ASCII characters for which you want to search, and filename is the full filename of the file to search. The ellipsis  …  indicates that you can specify more than one file to search.   C causes FIND to count all the lines that contain “string”. You use the  C switch to count the number of lines with the ASCII string; the text itself isn’t passed to the screen.   N causes FIND to include line numbers of the lines that contain the “string”. You use the  N switch to locate the line numbers within the text file. The line numbers listed are the line numbers in the original text file, not just sequential numbers. If the third, fifth, and sixth lines in the text file contain the string, for example, the line numbers displayed are 3, 5, and 6—not 1, 2, and 3.   V causes FIND to search only for lines that do not contain the “string”. Only these lines are passed on to the screen.   I makes FIND insensitive to case: Upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same.  Part III Ch 13   336  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices  Using FIND to Find Files on Disk  You can use  C and  V together. The count displayed is the number of lines that do not contain “string”. You also can use  V and  N together. The lines that do not contain “string” are displayed with their appropriate line numbers.  If you use FIND without options, the filter reads each of the files you specify and displays all lines that contain the ASCII string you are looking for. DOS filters the information that normally goes to the output device. All lines that include the ASCII string are displayed onscreen.  Like the other filter commands, FIND is often used with redirection and piping. If you search a text file for lines that include specific information, redirecting the output to a file might be helpful. You then can use the list as a reference while you look at the whole of the original file.  You can use the FIND command to find all files that have a certain extension. To find all files with the extension .LET, for example, type the following command: DIR  S  B  FIND “.LET”  Because the  S switch is used with this DIR command, all files whose names contain LET— either in the root or extension—are listed under the name of the directory containing them. Because the  B switch is used, the filenames are listed in the form FILENAME.EXT, with a peri- od instead of spaces separating the filename and its extension. Therefore, you can search for .LET instead of LET. In this form, each filename is preceded by its directory path.  The DIR command with the  S option lists all the files on a disk. The output for DIR that normally goes to the screen is filtered through the FIND command. The output from FIND then is displayed onscreen.  You also can use the FIND filter with text files as a word-search utility. Suppose, for example, that you forget the name of the memo you sent to your boss, but you know that the file is either MEMO1, MEMO2, or MEMO3. You also know that you always use your boss’s title, Supervisor, in memos. You can find the memo you need by typing the following: FIND “Supervisor” MEMO1 MEMO2 MEMO3  When you issue this command, each line that contains Supervisor is listed. The listing appears in the following form: ---------- MEMO1 ---------- MEMO2 Supervisor of Communications ---------- MEMO3   The SORT Filter  337  General Rules for Using FIND  The following aresome helpful rules to know when using FIND:    Use FIND only on ASCII text files.   The “string” parameter is normally case sensitive; that is, FIND regards the uppercase string LOOK as different from the lowercase string look. In DOS 5.0 and later, you can use the  I switch to perform a search that is not case sensitive.    To cause FIND to search for quotation marks in a string, type two quotation marks  together  “” . FIND then searches for occurrences of “.    If you do not specify a filename, FIND uses the standard input device.   You cannot use wildcards in a filename.  The SORT Filter  The third DOS filter is SORT, which sorts the information from an ASCII file before display- ing the result onscreen. Like FIND and MORE, SORT often is used with redirection and piping.  Issuing the SORT Filter  Use the following syntax for the SORT filter: SORT  R  +n   R reverses the sort order, and n is the offset column for the sorting process.  The SORT filter processes information that normally goes to your screen or to another out- put device. The text from the input is analyzed on a line-by-line basis and sorted according to the ASCII binary values of the characters. This order is alphabetical, but SORT doesn’t dis- criminate between upper- and lowercase letters.  When you use SORT with redirection or piping, more sophisticated sorting occurs. The most common use of SORT is to sort a directory listing into a text file, which you then can print.  The offset—the  +n option—in the command shows the leftmost column to be sorted. With a directory listing, you can sort by date or file size rather than by root name. Table 13.5 lists the offset values for a directory listing.  Part III Ch 13  Table 13.5 Offset Values for SORT  Offset Value 1  10  14  24  34  Sorting By Root name  File extension  File size  File date  File time   338  Chapter 13 Controlling Devices  The sorted output appears onscreen; the original directory listing itself remains unchanged.  This use of SORT is not as vital as it once was. Beginning with DOS 5.0, you can sort a directory listing by using the  O switch. To sort a directory by name, you can use the fol- lowing command: DIR \  ON  Similarly, you can use  OE to sort by extension,  OS to sort by size,  OD to sort by date and time combined, and  OC to sort by compression ratio  for DoubleSpace volumes . You still need to use SORT if you want to sort the directory by time alone.  Using SORT to Sort Subdirectory Listings  You can use redirection and piping, as well as the FIND and SORT filters, in many ways. In DOS 4.0, 4.01, or 5.0, for example, you can create a sorted list of the subdirectories in the root directory by using the process outlined in the next paragraphs.  To create a sorted list of subdirectories in the root directory, follow these steps:  1. Type the following command:  TREE C:\  A  FIND “-”  SORT  +2 >TEMP.LST When issued with the  A switch, the TREE command produces a listing that uses the nongraphics character set. The FIND filter then removes all lines that are not subdirec- tory names. SORT sorts the output from FIND on column 2, and the output is redirected to a temporary file.  2. Use the temporary file as the input to the FIND filter, which removes all directories that  are not in the root, by typing the following command:  FIND  V “” <TEMP.LST  The result is an alphabetical list of all subdirectories in the root directory.  General Rules for Using SORT  The following are some helpful rules to know when using SORT:    If n is not specified, DOS assumes column 1.   Lines are sorted according to their ASCII binary values, with two exceptions. SORT is  not case sensitive; for example, the command sorts A and a as they occur in the source file. Additionally, SORT sorts characters with values greater than 127 in the order deter- mined by the current COUNTRY code setting.  See Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files,” for more information.     The output filename must be different from the input filename when you use redirec-  tion.    The largest file the SORT program can handle is 64KB.   CHAPTER  14  Understanding the International Features of DOS In this chapter  Internationalization 340  Understanding COUNTRY.SYS 340  Understanding KEYB.COM 342  Understanding Code Page Switching 344  International Country Codes 354   340  Chapter 14 Understanding the International Features of DOS  Internationalization  Communication is making the world appear progressively smaller and smaller. Frequent contact among people from many different countries is not unusual. You can use computers to prepare documents and other files to send to all parts of the world.  Anything you work on that has international implications can cause you inconvenience if you do not adapt your computer to handle various languages and national customs. Presumably, most people reading this book and using DOS as their operating system live in the United States and have computers built to operate in the United States. Fortunately, however, Microsoft has built in to DOS the capability to internationalize your computer.  DOS provides three levels of internationalization. These levels involve the use of KEYB.COM and code page switching.  You might consider your standard version of DOS as perfect for most uses. Suppose, howev- er, that you must use a certain national format for expressing the time, the date, and curren- cy symbols. You can learn how to access these formats by reading this chapter and understanding the use of the COUNTRY.SYS configuration driver.  DOS supports 24 national languages or country customs. Each country or language is iden- tified by a country code that corresponds to the country’s international telephone code. The International Country Codes section at the end of this chapter lists the countries and lan- guages supported by DOS and their country codes. These country codes are referenced throughout this chapter.  When you use the country code or code page number, you must use all three digits, includ- ing any leading zeros.  In addition to the American standard version that you can customize for the supported country codes, Microsoft produces special language versions in Arabic, Chinese, Israeli, Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese.  Understanding COUNTRY.SYS  COUNTRY.SYS is a file that you can use to display alternative currency, date, and time formats on your system without using other language characters. This file contains all the conven- tions for the supported countries and national formats. Of course, if you have no need to change the default formats for your version of DOS, you have no need to use COUNTRY.SYS.  When you perform a disk directory command  DIR , the date and time stamps for disk files are displayed in the current national format. In the United States, the system date is normal- ly displayed and stamped on files as MM-DD-YY. You can use alternative methods such as YY-MM-DD  French Canadian  or DD MM YY  United Kingdom .   Understanding COUNTRY.SYS  341  Time formats separate hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of seconds using colons  HH:MM:SS:HS , periods  HH.MM.SS.HS , or colons and a comma  HH:MM:SS,HS .  In addition to the variety of currency symbols, such as $ and £, differing customs dictate whether the decimal characters are periods or commas—likewise for the thousands separa- tor. The placement of the currency symbol also can vary. In the United States, the dollar sign precedes the amount, but some currency symbols are placed after the amount.  COUNTRY.SYS contains information only for the video display, not for keyboards. To pro- vide keyboard support, you must use the KEYB command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or from the DOS prompt. For more information, see the next section, “Understanding KEYB.COM.”  You load COUNTRY.SYS by entering the COUNTRY command in the CONFIG.SYS file. Use EDIT to enter a statement into the file. Then, enter the command in the following format: COUNTRY=xxx,yyy,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS  You must place the three-character numeric country code as the first parameter, as indicated by xxx. You cannot omit this code. The second parameter is the code page number for the country, as represented by yyy. If you omit this code, DOS uses the default code page num- ber for the country specified by the country code.  The inclusion of the code page in the COUNTRY command is optional, even if you install code page switching. Be sure to include the code page, however, if you want an alternative code page—rather than the default code page—to be installed for the indicated country.  If you do not specify the second parameter  yyy , you still must include the second comma when you include the file specification: COUNTRY=xxx,,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS  The default statement for the United States version is shown in either of the following: COUNTRY=001  COUNTRY=001,,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS  Figure 14.1 shows a standard directory listing that uses the United States country code for- mats for the date  MM-DD-YY  and time  12-hour format with a.m. or p.m. indicator .  Part III Ch 14   342  Chapter 14 Understanding the International Features of DOS  Figure 14.1 A directory in the United States country code format.  Figure 14.2 A directory in the country code format for the United Kingdom.  If you want to use the United Kingdom currency, date, and time formats, use the following statement in your CONFIG.SYS file: COUNTRY=044,,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS  After you use EDIT to modify your CONFIG.SYS file to contain this statement, save the file  to disk and exit the Editor. Then, reboot your computer so that your change takes effect. When you next execute the DIR command, a directory listing shows the new format  see Figure 14.2 .  Notice that the date format has changed to DD MM YY, and the time is displayed in  24-hour format.  Understanding KEYB.COM  Whereas the COUNTRY.SYS driver provides nondefault formats on the display screen, KEYB.COM provides compatible keyboard characters for the selected nationality. For a list  of international keyboard codes, refer to the last section in this chapter.  You normally place KEYB.COM in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, although you can type the command at the DOS prompt. You also can load KEYB.COM through the CONFIG.SYS file when you use the INSTALL= command.   Understanding KEYB.COM  343  You can use the KEYB command even if you have not installed any country codes through COUNTRY.SYS.  Make sure your DOS subdirectory  normally C:\DOS  is in your system’s search path. Then, you do not need to specify the location of KEYB.COM unless you install the utility in the  CONFIG.SYS file. The format of this command is as follows: KEYB xx,yyy,C:\DOS\KEYBOARD.SYS  E  ID:nnn  The xx parameter is the two-letter code for the country or language. The yyy parameter is the code page number, if used.  ➔ For country codes and code page numbers, see the “International Country Codes” section at the end of  this chapter.  ➔ For a list of countries with the alternative keyboards and the ID numbers you can use with KEYB, see  the “International Country Codes” section at the end of this chapter. You also can add two options to the KEYB command:  E and  ID. Use  E to tell DOS that you are using an enhanced keyboard  101- or 102-key style  on a computer with an Intel 8086 or compatible processor. The second switch,  ID, tells DOS which keyboard you are using. You can use one of 20 keyboards specially designed for the supported countries. France, Italy, and the United Kingdom each have two keyboard layouts available.  If you set your system to one of these three countries with COUNTRY.SYS and KEYB.COM and you use an alternative keyboard, you might find it useful to add the  ID:nnn switch to the KEYB command line  where nnn is one of the three-digit ID numbers  to make your keyboard work properly.  If you want to specify the code page to be used, you include it in the command line for KEYB. If the KEYBOARD.SYS file is not in the root directory of the boot drive, you must include that file specification together with its path. The path is normally C:\DOS. If you include the location and name of KEYBOARD.SYS, you must include the second comma, as follows, to hold the place for the code page parameter, even if you do not include the code page number: KEYB xx,,C:\DOS\KEYBOARD.SYS  If you enter the KEYB command without any parameters or switches and you have not yet installed the keyboard utility, DOS responds with the following message: KEYB has not been installed Active code page not available from CON device  At the DOS prompt, type KEYB UK and press Enter to load KEYB with the character set used for the United Kingdom. Then, type KEYB and press Enter. DOS displays the following  message: Current keyboard code: UK  code page: 437 Active code page not available from CON device  Part III Ch 14  As you can see, DOS assumes the default code page number for the United Kingdom, 437. Because at this point you are not concerned with code page switching, you can ignore the   344  Chapter 14 Understanding the International Features of DOS  code page message. This subject is discussed later in this chapter  in the section “Understanding Code Page Switching” .  To install KEYB when MS-DOS boots and processes the CONFIG.SYS file, use the following format: INSTALL=C:\DOS\KEYB.COM xx,yyy,C:\DOS\KEYBOARD.SYS  Because your system search path has not yet been set, you must include the location of the utility. You must include also the full name and extension of the program  C:\DOS\KEYB.COM  before continuing with the parameters for KEYB.  ➔ For more information on modifying the CONFIG.SYS file, see Chapter 2, “Starting DOS,” p. 23.  DOS provides a way of switching between your hardware default keyboard layout and the layout you loaded with KEYB.COM. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1  hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys while pressing F1  to switch to the United States keyboard layout. Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to return to the keyboard layout installed with KEYB.  Understanding Code Page Switching  Certain areas of memory in your system store the character tables for your video screen and your keyboard. By switching tables, you can configure MS-DOS to use alternative character tables to suit your national language and customs. These tables are called code pages.  Changing the character set used in your computer to support another language through code page switching does not change the language that DOS uses. All messages are dis- played in the default  English  language in which DOS was written. No translation is made.  You can set your system to use an alternative code page permanently, or you can enable sev- eral code pages in memory and switch between them from the command line. These code pages are software prepared; your system’s hardware is not changed. Your system already has a built-in hardware code page.  In the previous section that discussed COUNTRY.SYS, you learned that each country or area of the world has a unique country code number borrowed from the international telephone convention. Each country or group of countries also has a code page number.  Many coun- tries share a code page number with another country.   Each DOS-supported code page includes support for several languages. This feature might simplify international communications so that documents prepared with the same character table might be processed by people in different countries using different languages, with all characters appearing the same to all concerned.  The international code page, code 850, has some graphic limitations to provide room for additional language characters required by some countries. Only 256 codes are available. If you normally use the United States code page  437 , for example, you might find that boxes under 850 lose their graphic corners and are replaced with other characters.   Understanding Code Page Switching  345  When you install alternative code pages in your computer, the normal keys and their ASCII display characters do not change. Symbol keys are remapped, and by using special key- strokes, you can enter national language characters.  Checking Your Hardware for Code Page Switching  You do need the proper hardware to switch software code pages. All code page information required for loading alternative character sets is contained in disk files with the extension .CPI. Two screen device code page information files are supplied with DOS. EGA.CPI pro- vides support for EGA and VGA displays, and LCD.CPI provides support for LCD screens. You must have an EGA, VGA, or LCD video display. Hercules-type monographic and CGA screens do not support this feature.  The LCD.CPI, 4201.CPI, 4208.CPI, 5202.CPI, and EGA2.CPI files as well as  PRINTER.SYS are no longer automatically supplied as part of DOS. However, these files and others are available from Microsoft on a supplemental disk.   You can download the MS-DOS 6.22 supplemental disks from http:  www. microsoft.com downloads.  If you have an EGA or a VGA display, you can have up to six software code pages. If you have an LCD display, you can have only one software code page. If you have a monochrome or CGA video adapter and monitor, you can use only the built-in hardware code page.  Certain printers, along with others that are 100% compatible with them, also support code page switching. Three code page information files are provided with DOS on the supple- mental disks: 4201.CPI, 4208.CPI, and 5202.CPI. Table 14.1 lists the printers supported by these files. Even if your printer emulates one of these printers, it also must have the capa- bility to accept code page switching.  Some printers provide emulation but not code page support.   Table 14.1 National Code Page Printer Files  Printer IBM Proprinter II, III  IBM Proprinter XL  IBM Proprinter X24E  IBM Proprinter XL24E  IBM QuietWriter III  Code Page File  4201.CPI  4201.CPI  4208.CPI  4208.CPI  5202.CPI  Part III Ch 14   346  Chapter 14 Understanding the International Features of DOS  Installing Code Page Switching  Assuming that you have the appropriate hardware, you must take a number of steps and  load certain programs to enable code page switching, both for your video screen and for your printer.  Use MS-DOS EDIT to make the necessary changes to the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.   To enable code page switching for your video display, you add a statement to the CONFIG.SYS file for the DISPLAY.SYS device driver. To enable code page switching for your printer, you add a statement for the PRINTER.SYS device driver. If you want code page switching enabled for both devices, you simply include both statements.  You also must use the COUNTRY.SYS device driver to handle the screen formats for currency, dates, and times.  Then, to provide the national language support, you add the NLSFUNC.EXE command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  The following sections explain how you set up code page switching on your system, includ- ing how to use NLSFUNC.EXE to enable the feature, how to use MODE PREPARE to load the code page tables, and how to use CHCP and MODE SELECT to switch the code page.  Using DISPLAY.SYS You can use the DISPLAY.SYS device driver to enable code page switching for your video dis- play. The DISPLAY.SYS can be used only if you have an EGA, VGA, or LCD monitor and adapter.  The format of the command is either of the following: DEVICE=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS CON= monitor,hardware,xx   DEVICE=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS CON= monitor,hardware, xx,yy    Unless you move the DISPLAY.SYS file to the root directory of your boot drive, you must specify the location of the file  normally C:\DOS . Enter the monitor type as the first parame- ter for the console device  monitor . EGA is the typical monitor entry and stands for both EGA and VGA monitors. Use LCD for LCD screens. No other values are possible.  The second parameter, hardware, refers to the built-in hardware code page. In the United States, this code page is 437; if you are not certain of your system’s built-in hardware code page, however, do not specify it.  The xx variable refers to the number of code pages you want enabled in your system. This parameter tells DOS to set aside memory for the number of additional character tables to be installed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or at the DOS prompt.  Enter a number for the yy variable to represent the number of subfonts you want. You can specify the number of fonts that DOS is to store in memory. Two subfonts are available for EGA VGA displays, and only one is available for LCD displays. Normally, all are stored; however, you can lower the number stored to reduce the amount of memory used. If you use this variable, you must place a pair of parentheses around the number of code pages and the number of fonts, as shown in the second example.   Understanding Code Page Switching  347  Suppose that you want to enable code page switching for your display for French Canada and also to allow for the use of the international code. To do so, you enter the following statement in your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS CON= EGA,,2   No default hardware code page is declared, and DOS is instructed to set aside memory for two code pages for an EGA or VGA adapter and monitor. Do not omit the commas.  You can specify up to six code page tables to be prepared in memory in addition to the hard- ware code page. Just remember that each code page takes up RAM  about 5,632 bytes for EGA and VGA  and might lower the amount of conventional memory available for your applications. Do not set aside more memory than is required.  ➔ For further information on memory and memory configuration, see p. 11 and p. 441.  Using PRINTER.SYS Use the PRINTER.SYS device driver to enable code page switching for your printer if you have one of the supported printers or a compatible. Supported printers can be attached to any or all of the three allowed parallel printer ports: LPT1, LPT2, and LPT3.  The format of the command is as follows: DEVICE=C:\DOS\PRINTER.SYS LPTx= printer,hardware,yy   Unless you move the PRINTER.SYS file to the root directory of your boot drive, you must specify the location of the file  normally C:\DOS . Replace x with the proper parallel port number: 1, 2, or 3.  Replace printer with 4201, 4208, or 5202, whichever is appropriate for your printer. The next parameter, hardware, refers to the built-in hardware code page. In the United States, this code page is 437, but do not specify it if you are not certain of your printer type.  The variable yy refers to the number of additional code pages that your hardware can sup- port and you want prepared. This parameter tells DOS to set aside memory for the number of additional character tables to be installed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or at the DOS prompt.  To instruct DOS to set aside memory for two code pages for an IBM QuietWriter III or compatible printer attached to LPT1, for example, enter the following statement in your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=C:\DOS\PRINTER.SYS LPT1= 5202,,2   No default hardware code page is declared.  You can specify up to six code page tables to be prepared in memory. The maximum, how- ever, depends on the printer you are using. Do not set aside more memory than is required because these tables consume memory.  Part III Ch 14   348  Chapter 14 Understanding the International Features of DOS  To enable code page switching on your printer, make sure that your printer is turned on and is online when your system is booted. Otherwise, the control signals cannot be down- loaded to the printer.  Using NLSFUNC.EXE After you take care of the required statements in your CONFIG.SYS file for COUNTRY.SYS and DISPLAY.SYS, move your attention to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. As discussed in this chapter’s “Understanding KEYB.COM” section, make sure that your keyboard is specified for the appro- priate national keyboard and code page number. The following command, for example, specifies code page 863 for French Canada: KEYB cf,863,C:\DOS\KEYBOARD.SYS  You then must include NLSFUNC as the next command to provide the National Language Support  NLS  for code page switching. You can type this command at the DOS prompt or place the command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file for automatic loading whenever you boot your computer. To enter the NLSFUNC command in your CONFIG.SYS file, use the following format: INSTALL=C:\DOS\NLSFUNC.EXE  Because a path has not yet been established when the command is in your CONFIG.SYS file, you must specify the location of the NLSFUNC file.  Up to this point, you have specified your country code of choice and have prepared your system to use code page switching. The following sections explain how to use the commands that load the specified code pages into the prepared memory areas.  Loading the Code Page Tables  You include the MODE command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load code page information, specifying the code pages to be prepared and the code page file to use for the tables. Use MODE CON: to load the code page information for your video display  the console . Use MODE LPT1: to load the code page information for your printer and download the information to the printer.  Make sure that your printer is turned on and is online to receive the down- loaded data.   In the command, you can list as many code pages as you specified in the CONFIG.SYS file. Do not specify the hardware default code page number because this table is already built in. The format of the command is shown in the following  the parentheses are required : MODE device CP PREPARE=  xxx,yyy  filename   The device parameter indicates that you want to load a character set into your console, key- board, or parallel printers. The xxx and yyy parameters indicate the code page numbers to be prepared, and filename refers to the CPI file where the table is stored on disk for the device.   Understanding Code Page Switching  349  Consider the following example: MODE CON: CP PREPARE=  863,850  C:\DOS\EGA.CPI   In this command, MODE is used to PREPARE  or PREP  the console  CON:  for code pages  CP , with code pages 863 for French Canada and 850 for International. EGA.CPI is listed as the table file for EGA and VGA monitors. The location of this file is the C:\DOS subdirectory.  For your printer, use the MODE command for each parallel printer port listed in the CONFIG.SYS file’s PRINTER.SYS statement. The following examples prepare the printers at the LPT1 and LPT2 ports: MODE LPT1: CP PREP=  863,850  C:\DOS\5202.CPI   MODE LPT2: CP PREP=  863,850  C:\DOS\4201.CPI   As with the other AUTOEXEC.BAT commands for code page switching, you also can enter the MODE commands at the DOS prompt.  Switching the Code Page  After you complete all the preparation work—specifying the nationality and code page codes to be used, setting aside the memory for the language tables, and loading the character tables—you are ready to use the new code pages.  In the previous examples, you prepared your system to use the French Canadian character set. To have this character set take effect, you must issue the CHCP command, for changing  the code page. Use the CHCP command, along with the code page number, as shown in the  following: CHCP 863  Enter this command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or at the DOS prompt. The CHCP com- mand must be listed in AUTOEXEC.BAT after the settings for code switching. The instruction tells DOS to change the current code page to the new code page specified in  the command on all devices prepared, including the printer if you have included it in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Make certain that the printer is turned on and is online so that the new code page can take effect.  ➔ For more information on modifying the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, see p. 23.  You also can selectively change code pages of individual devices by using the MODE SELECT command and pressing Enter. The full format of the command follows: MODE device CODEPAGE SELECT = xxx  For device, use CON for console or use PRN  which is the same as LPT1 , LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3 for the printer ports. After the equal sign  = , enter the code page number  xxx .  Suppose, for example, that you want to change the code page in your IBM QuietWriter III printer, but you don’t want to affect the monitor display. If your printer is attached to LPT1 and you want to print with the French Canadian character set, issue the following command and press Enter: MODE LPT1 CP SEL=863  Part III Ch 14   350  Chapter 14 Understanding the International Features of DOS  You can abbreviate CODEPAGE as CP and SELECT as SEL.  Exploring More Uses for MODE and CODEPAGE  To ascertain the currently active code page for any device, issue the following command and press Enter: MODE device CODEPAGE  STATUS  This command works the same with or without the  STATUS option. DOS returns the status of the active code page and all prepared code pages for the specified device, including the hardware code page, as shown in Figure 14.3.  Figure 14.3 Viewing the code page status.  C:\>MODE CON CODPAGE  STATUS  Active code page for device CON is 863  Hardware code pages:  code page 437  Prepared code pages:  code page 863  code page 850  MODE status code page function completed  C:\>  To check the code page for the display monitor, for example, type this command at the DOS prompt and press Enter: MODE CON CP  At times, you might need to refresh the code page for a particular device, especially code page printers. The printers do not store the code page fonts when they are turned off and on again. Also, use the following command if the printer was not turned on and online when you enabled code page switching on the printer: MODE device CODEPAGE REFRESH  To refresh the code page for the printer hooked up to LPT1, for example, type the follow- ing command at the DOS prompt and press Enter: MODE LPT1 CP REF  If you issue a code page command for your printer through CHCP, MODE SELECT, or MODE REFRESH, and your printer does not accept code pages or is not turned on and online, an error message appears when you try to print. You might notice a delay before receiving the error message, depending on the length of the timeout period.   Understanding Code Page Switching  351  You can abbreviate REFRESH as REF.  Considering Keyboard Remappings  When you change the default country and keyboard codes on your computer system, you find that certain keys no longer work as labeled. The following information pertains to stan- dard United States keyboards, but changing the country code also might affect systems with national keyboards.  Continuing with the previous examples for COUNTRY.SYS and KEYB.COM, set the country and keyboard codes to 044 and UK for the United Kingdom. Your CONFIG.SYS file should con- tain the following statement: COUNTRY=044,,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS  If necessary, reboot your computer so that this command takes effect. Then, in your  AUTOEXEC.BAT file or at the DOS prompt, type the following command and press Enter: KEYB UK,,C:\DOS\KEYBOARD.SYS  After your system reboots and KEYB is installed, press the backslash key  \ . Notice that instead of displaying the backslash character, your system displays a hash mark   . Pressing Shift+3 produces the British currency symbol  £ . A few other key remappings occur when you use the United Kingdom country and keyboard codes on a standard American keyboard with the American default version of MS-DOS. Table 14.2 lists the remappings for this con- figuration.  Table 14.2 Remappings for the United Kingdom on a United States Keyboard  Standard Character ~  Remapped Character    @      \  “  “  £  ~    @  If you require extensive use of an alternative language keyboard, you can save yourself the problem of remembering the key changes. Print the changed characters on address or disk labels, cut out the characters, and paste them to your keyboard in the remapped positions.  Because you lose the backslash key  \  with this remapping of your keyboard, you might have trouble working with subdirectories. To enter the backslash character, hold down the Alt key and, using the numeric keypad on the right side of your keyboard, press the num- bers 9 and 2. You also can press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to the United States layout and Ctrl+Alt+F2 to return to the country format you installed.  Part III Ch 14   352  Chapter 14 Understanding the International Features of DOS  Using Dead Keys  When you tell DOS to use a different keyboard or character set, your keyboard keys pro- duce different results. In addition to the remapped keyboard, a device called a dead key enables you to enter special language characters.  Normally, when you type an alphabetic character on your keyboard, the letter appears with- out any accents. The use of a dead key enables you to enter an acute accent      , a grave accent      , or a circumflex accent  ^  with certain vowels and other keys. These marks are used in some languages but are not provided on a standard American keyboard.  When you press the dead key, nothing appears on the screen. When you press the next appropriate letter key, the accented character appears. If you press an inappropriate key, DOS beeps and displays nothing.  Table 14.3 lists the keys on the United States keyboard that are remapped when you enable code page 863  for French Canada .  Table 14.3  Language Support for French Canada on United States Keyboard  Standard Character ‘  Remapped Character   ~  @    ^  \       ?    “     ?  <  >  é  É  Table 14.4 lists the dead key keyboard mappings for French Canada.

The four keys you need to test as dead keys are the apostrophe  ’ , question mark  ? , left square bracket  [ , and right square bracket  ] .  As an alternative to using code page switching to access special language-specific characters, you can load the support for the required language table with the KEYB command and then use the Alt+nnn technique. The nnn stands for the ASCII code for the specific character and is typed on the numeric keypad of your keyboard  not on the numbers above the typewriter keys of your keyboard .  ➔ See Appendix E for a listing of ASCII codes.  Part III Ch 14   354  Chapter 14 Understanding the International Features of DOS  Using Foreign-Language Commands  MS-DOS requires a foreign-language version to be installed in order to use foreign- language keyboard commands and other system functions  such as help screens for com- mands . Attempting to load an alternative code page—for example, German—and then attempting to issue German commands does not work without using the German version  of DOS.  By default, the characters in the default code page are United States English for all versions; DOS uses code pages to convert to the native language.  If you have installed the international version of DOS and are still encountering problems using a code page, first check how you are implementing the KEYB command and then check that the country code you are attempting to use matches the version of DOS you have.  International Country Codes  MS-DOS provides support for a number of different international code pages, which are simply character sets that facilitate the needs of a particular language. The lower ASCII characters  0 to 127  always remain the same, but the characters available in the upper ASCII set  128 to 255  are changed to make certain special characters available. The code page information file included with DOS 6  EGA.CPI  includes displayable character sets for the following international code pages:  MS-DOS 6.2 provides an additional file  EGA2.CPI  that supports the following international code pages:  Code Page 437 860 850 863 852 865  Code Page 437 857 850 861 852 869  Country or Language United States Portuguese Multilingual  Latin I  Canadian-French Slavic  Latin II  Nordic  Country or Language United States Turkish Multilingual  Latin I  Icelandic Slavic  Latin II  Greek   International Country Codes  355  In the following table, you can find the countries or languages supported by the internation- al features of MS-DOS 6. The country code and the default and alternate code pages  char- acter sets  are specified for each country. DOS’s international commands—such as COUNTRY=, CHCP, KEYB, and MODE—use country codes, keyboard codes, and code pages:  Country or Language Belgium Brazil Canada  French  Croatia Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Hungary International English Italy Latin America Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Serbia Yugoslavia Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden Switzerland  French  Switzerland  German  United Kingdom United States  Country  Code 032 055 002 038 042 045 358 033 049 036 061 039 003 031 047 048 351 038 042 038 034 046 041 041 044 001  Default Code Page 850 850 863 852 852 850 850 850 850 852 437 850 850 850 850 852 850 852 852 852 850 850 850 850 437 437  Alternate Code Page 437 437 850 850 850 865 437 437 437 850 850 437 437 437 865 850 860 850 850 850 437 437 437 437 850 850  First DOS Version 2.1 5.0 3.3 6.0 6.0 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.1 5.0 2.1 2.1 3.3 2.1 2.1 5.0 3.3 6.0 6.0 6.0 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.1  Special versions of MS-DOS that support the following countries and languages also are available: Arabic, Israel, Japan, Korea, People’s Republic of China, and Taiwan.

It is the perfect tool for creating short text documents and editing text ﬁles. When you try the DOS Editor, you are in for a pleasant surprise. The Editor is so easy and intuitive to use that you will likely become a regular user.  The DOS Editor falls into a class of programs known as text editors. As the name implies, a text editor works with ﬁles that contain pure text  as opposed to binary ﬁles, which contain programming instructions or formatted data .  Uses for the DOS Editor  Following are some of the typical tasks for which the DOS Editor is ideally suited:    Creating, editing, and printing memos  and other text documents    Viewing text ﬁles whose contents are unknown   Creating or modifying various system conﬁguration ﬁles, such as AUTOEXEC.BAT and   CONFIG.SYS    Writing and modifying batch ﬁles  ➔ For more information about batch ﬁles, see Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files,” p. 389.    Writing and saving README ﬁles  Many computer users place a README ﬁle in a hard disk subdirectory, or on a ﬂoppy disk, to explain the contents of other ﬁles in the subdirec- tory or on the disk.     Creating and viewing ﬁles that are uploaded to or downloaded from electronic bulletin    Writing programs for programming language environments that don’t include a resi-  boards, such as CompuServe  dent editor  Be aware that document ﬁles produced by some word processors aren’t pure text ﬁles. The ﬁles can contain special formatting or printer-control characters. Most word proces- sors can import the pure text ﬁles created with the DOS Editor. The Editor, however, might not successfully import word processor document ﬁles that contain certain format- ting characters.  Files Required to Run the DOS Editor  The Editor is provided with DOS. It is invoked by the external command EDIT, which runs the program EDIT.COM. When you run the Editor, EDIT.COM calls on two other ﬁles: QBASIC.EXE and EDIT.HLP. Only QBASIC.EXE is required. EDIT.HLP contains the text of the help messages, but the Editor works without this ﬁle.   Understanding the DOS Editor  363  Using the DOS Editor from a Floppy Disk  Having a bootable ﬂoppy disk with the DOS Editor on it can be very useful for trou- bleshooting computer problems. You can copy the Editor onto a ﬂoppy disk in two different ways, depending on the version of DOS you have.  ➔ To make a ﬂoppy disk bootable, see “Creating a Floppy Boot Disk,” p. 25.  If you are using DOS 6.x, you must copy the EDIT.COM, EDIT.HLP, and QBASIC.EXE ﬁles from the C:\DOS directory to the ﬂoppy.  If you are using Windows 9x, you need to copy just the EDIT.COM and EDIT.HLP ﬁles from the \Windows\Commands directory. You no longer need to copy the QBASIC.EXE ﬁle.  Part IV Ch 15  Starting the DOS Editor  You can start the DOS Editor from the DOS Shell or from the command line. To start it, type the following at the DOS prompt and press Enter: EDIT  A preliminary screen appears  see Figure 15.1 .  Figure 15.1 The preliminary DOS Editor screen appears when you ﬁrst use the EDIT command.  You now must press either Enter or Esc:    Enter activates the Survival Guide.

Now the DOS Editor screen is blank, and you can begin writing a text ﬁle. Your screen should look like the one shown in Figure 15.2.   364  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  Menu bar  Title bar  Editor window  Figure 15.2 The Editor screen, shown with a blank editing area, is ready for you to begin work- ing on a ﬁle.  Status bar  Scrollbars  Getting Acquainted with the Initial Editor Screen  Take a moment to look at your screen  or refer to Figure 15.2 . The screen consists of sev- eral elements:    The menu bar lists the available menus: File, Edit, Search, Options, and Help. The  title bar contains the name of the text ﬁle being edited  it is now Untitled .    The status bar describes the current process and shows certain shortcut key options.   Scrollbars are a vertical strip along the right edge and a horizontal strip just above the status bar. You use the scrollbars with a mouse to move through the ﬁle.  Mouse tech- niques are described in the section “Using a Mouse” later in this chapter.     The Editor window is the large area in which the text of your ﬁle appears. The cursor  is the ﬂashing underscore character that indicates where typed text will appear.  Navigating the DOS Editor  The DOS Editor provides several ways to perform most commands. The Editor has a user- friendly set of menus from which you can choose options. Many of these options require you to enter further information in an onscreen box known as a dialog box, discussed in “Understanding Dialog Boxes” later in the chapter.  The Editor enables you to execute many commands by pressing special shortcut keys. You also can use a mouse to execute commands.  The following sections describe how to use menus, dialog boxes, shortcut keys, and a mouse in the DOS Editor.   Navigating the DOS Editor  365  Part IV Ch 15  Understanding the Menu System  The DOS Editor menu system provides many editing commands. The menu bar contains the following options: File, Edit, Search, Options, and Help. Choosing any of these options displays a pull-down menu. The File option displays a menu that enables you to load, save, and print ﬁles. You use the Edit menu to cut and paste text. You can use the Search menu for ﬁnding and replacing speciﬁed text. The Options menu can be used to reconﬁgure envi- ronment options, and the Help menu provides access to online help.  To activate the menu bar, press Alt. The ﬁrst letter of each menu name is highlighted. To open a menu, press the ﬁrst letter of the menu name. To activate the File menu, for exam- ple, press Alt and then F  Alt+F . Similarly, press Alt+E to display the Edit menu, Alt+S to display the Search menu, Alt+O to display the Options menu, or Alt+H to display the Help menu.  Every time you open a main menu, the ﬁrst command on the menu is highlighted. You can move this highlight to the other commands by pressing the up- or down-arrow key. As you move the highlight, notice that the status bar displays a brief description of the highlighted command.  On a menu, one letter of each command is highlighted. On most systems, the highlighted letter appears in high-intensity white. To execute a command, move the highlight to that command and press Enter, or press the key that corresponds to the highlighted letter.  Depending on which editing commands you have executed previously, some commands in a menu might not be available. In such a case, the menu shows the command name in a dull color  usually gray , and no highlighted letter appears in the name. If you try to execute an unavailable command, the DOS Editor sounds a beep and refuses to execute the command.  The Esc key is the “oops” key. Pressing Esc closes the menu system and returns you to the Editor.  In the pull-down menus, an ellipsis  …  following the name of a command indicates that a dialog box opens when you issue that command.  Sometimes, depending on the circum- stances, a command without an ellipsis also opens a dialog box.   Understanding Dialog Boxes  When you execute a menu command, it can start immediately or, depending on the com- mand and the current context, a dialog box might pop up. A dialog box means that the DOS Editor needs more information before it can carry out the command. If, for example, you execute the command to save a new ﬁle, the Editor ﬁrst needs to know what name to give the ﬁle. A dialog box prompts you for the necessary information.  If you activate the Search menu, for example, and then choose Change, the DOS Editor dis- plays the Change dialog box  see Figure 15.3 .   366  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  Figure 15.3 In the Change dialog box, you indicate what you want to search and replace.  The DOS Editor uses dialog boxes to get a variety of information. Sometimes you must type something, such as a ﬁlename or a search string in a text box. Sometimes you must choose from a list of options. At other times, you select from a series of command buttons.  ➔ For a discussion of dialog boxes, text boxes, option buttons, and command buttons, see Chapter 4,  “Using the DOS Shell,” p. 57. When a DOS Editor dialog box opens, the following three keys have special signiﬁcance:    Tab moves the cursor from one area of the dialog box to the next area. After you spec-  ify information in one area, use Tab to move to the next area.    Esc aborts the menu option and returns you to the Editor. Use Esc when you change  your mind and decide against issuing a particular command.    Enter is the “go ahead” key. Press it when all options in the dialog box are as you want them and you are ready to execute the command. You press Enter only once while you are working inside a dialog box. Use Tab, not Enter, to move the cursor from one area of the dialog box to the next area.  Be careful. Most people tend to press Enter after they type information, such as a ﬁlename. Remember that when you need to specify additional information inside the dialog box, press Tab, not Enter.   In every dialog box, one command button is enclosed in highlighted angle brackets. The highlighted brackets identify the action that takes place when you press Enter.  To highlight the angle brackets of the command button you want, press Tab repeatedly. Be sure not to press Enter until you have speciﬁed everything satisfactorily.  When you are working with a dialog box, Alt is an “express” key. By pressing Alt and a highlighted letter, you activate an option even if the cursor is in another area.  Using Shortcut Keys  For convenience, many commonly used DOS Editor menu commands have an associated shortcut key. Pressing this shortcut key while you are working with the Editor executes the command directly, bypassing the menu system. Table 15.1 provides a complete list of short- cut keys.   Navigating the DOS Editor  367  Table 15.1 DOS Editor Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts  Shortcut Key F1  Effect View help on menu or command  Mouse Click the right button on the desired item  View help on getting started  Click Getting Started  Help menu   View the next help topic  Click Next  status bar   Review the preceding help screen  Click Back  status bar   Shift+Ctrl+F1  View the preceding help topic  None  Part IV Ch 15  Shift+F1  Ctrl+F1  Alt+F1  F3  F6  Shift+F6  Shift+Del  Ctrl+Ins  Shift+Ins  Del  Ctrl+Q, A  Ctrl+Q, F  Esc  Alt  Alt+plus  Alt+minus  Repeat the last Find  Move between help and the  desired window  Make the preceding window active   Cut selected text  Copy selected text  Erase selected text  Change text  Click Repeat Last Find  Search menu   Click in the desired window  Click in the desired window  Click Cut  Edit menu   Click Copy  Edit menu   Click Clear  Edit menu   Click Change  Search menu   Paste text from the Clipboard  Click Paste  Edit menu   Search for a text string  Click Find  Search menu   Terminate the Help System  Click Cancel  status bar   Enter Menu-selection mode  None  Enlarge the active window  Drag the title bar up  Shrink the active window  Drag the title bar down  Using a Mouse  A mouse is an excellent pointing device for computer applications. The DOS Editor sup- ports a mouse. You can execute menu commands and many editing tasks by using a mouse. If your system is mouseless, you can get along ﬁne; if you have a mouse, try it and see what you think.  The DOS Editor works with any Microsoft-compatible mouse and driver. If you have a mouse, you presumably know how to install and activate your mouse driver. Microsoft supplies a generic mouse driver as part of MS-DOS.   368  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  When the mouse is active, you see a special mouse cursor onscreen. The mouse cursor is  a small rectangle, about the size of one text character, which moves as you move the mouse. Notice that the regular blinking cursor remains active. You can continue to use  all the keyboard commands and features. Refer to Table 15.1 for a comprehensive list of mouse techniques.  The following are some additional mouse pointers:    To open a menu, click the menu name in the menu bar.   To execute a menu command, click the command name in the menu.   To set an option in a dialog box, click that option.   To abort a menu, click a location outside the menu.   To move the cursor in the ﬁle, click at the location you want.   To select text, drag the mouse cursor over the text. That is, move the mouse cursor to  one end of the text you want to select; then press and hold down the mouse button while you move the mouse, across the text, to the other end of the text you want to select.    To activate the Editor window while a help screen is visible, click anywhere inside the  Editor window.    To expand or shrink the Editor window while a help screen is visible, drag the title bar  of the Editor window up or down.    To scroll the screen horizontally one character, click the left or right arrow at either end  of the horizontal scrollbar.  the vertical scrollbar.    To scroll the screen vertically one character, click the up or down arrow at either end of    To scroll text vertically to a speciﬁc position, move the mouse cursor to the scroll box   the inverse-video rectangle inside the vertical scrollbar . Then, drag the scroll box along the scrollbar to the desired position.    To scroll text one page at a time, click the vertical scrollbar somewhere between the  scroll box and the top or bottom of the scrollbar.    To scroll horizontally several positions at once, click the horizontal scrollbar somewhere  between the scroll box and the left or right end of the scrollbar.    To execute a dialog box action enclosed in angle brackets, click the name between the  brackets.    To execute any keystroke action enclosed in angle brackets in the status bar, click the  name inside the angle brackets.  Mastering Fundamental Editing Techniques  Editing is a skill—almost an art. Some editing techniques are simple, others more complex. You can perform many editing tasks in more than one way. The following sections discuss the fundamental editing skills, which include moving the cursor, scrolling, and inserting and deleting text.   Mastering Fundamental Editing Techniques  369  Moving the Cursor  When you have text in the DOS Editor window, you can move the cursor around the text in several ways. The Editor provides two alternative cursor-movement interfaces:    Keypad interface—The specialized IBM PC keys—the arrow keys, Ins, Del, and so  on—govern most editing activities. To move the cursor up, for example, you use the up- arrow key.    Control-key interface—Ctrl+key combinations can also be used for most editing  activities. To move the cursor up, for example, you press Ctrl+E. This interface is used in the word processing program WordStar.  Part IV Ch 15  Generally, the DOS Editor accommodates both camps. Most editing techniques are avail- able with both the keypad and Control-key  WordStar-style  sequences. A few techniques, however, can be performed with only one method. This chapter focuses on the keypad style. The Control-key combinations are mentioned only when required by a particular editing technique.  Table 15.2 summarizes the cursor-movement commands.  Table 15.2 Cursor-Movement Commands  Effect Character left  Character right  Word left  Word right  Line up  Line down  First indentation level  Beginning of line  End of line  Top of window  Bottom of window  Beginning of text  End of text  Set marker  Move to marker  Keypad Left arrow  Right arrow  Ctrl+left arrow  Ctrl+right arrow  Up arrow  Down arrow  Home  None  End  None  None  Ctrl+Home  Ctrl+End  None  None  Control-Key Style Ctrl+S  Ctrl+D  Ctrl+A  Ctrl+F  Ctrl+E  Ctrl+X  None  Ctrl+Q, S  Ctrl+Q, D  Ctrl+J  Ctrl+Q, E  Ctrl+Q, X  Ctrl+Q, R  Ctrl+Q, C Ctrl+K, n  n equals 0–3  Ctrl+Q, n  n equals 0–3   Beginning of next line  Ctrl+Enter   370  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  Look at the far-right end of the status bar, in the lower-right corner of the DOS Editor screen. You see two numbers, separated by a colon. The two numbers indicate the cursor’s current location in your ﬁle. The ﬁrst number is the current row; the second, the current column.  Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, and watch the numbers change. Press Num Lock; an uppercase N appears next to the location numbers to indicate that Num Lock is on. Press Num Lock a few more times to toggle the indicator on and off. Press Caps Lock; an uppercase C appears next to the location numbers, left of the N, to indicate that the Caps Lock key is on.  Scrolling  Scrolling is the movement of text inside the Editor window. When you scroll, you bring into view a portion of the ﬁle currently not visible in the Editor window. Scrolling, which can be horizontal as well as vertical, keeps the cursor at the same row and column number but moves the text in the window.  Table 15.3 summarizes the scrolling commands. For large-scale scrolling, you use the PgUp and PgDn keys. Try using these keys by themselves and with the Ctrl key.  Table 15.3  Scrolling Text  One line down  Ctrl+down arrow  Effect One line up  Page up  Page down  One window left  One window right  Keypad Ctrl+up arrow  Control-Key Style Ctrl+W  PgUp  PgDn  Ctrl+PgUp  Ctrl+PgDn  Ctrl+Z  Ctrl+R  Ctrl+C  None  None  Inserting Text into a Line  You can insert text into an existing line. To do so, move the cursor to the position at which you want to insert text; then type the text you want to insert. As you type, text to the right of the cursor moves right to accommodate the inserted text. You can move off the line by using any of the cursor-movement keys. Do not press Enter to move off the line. Pressing Enter splits the line in two. If you want to replace, or overwrite, the text instead of inserting, press the Insert key. See the “Overtyping” section later in this chapter.  Deleting Text from a Line  You can use one of the following two methods to delete a few characters from a line:    Move the cursor to the character you want to delete. Press the Del key. To delete con-  secutive characters, continue pressing Del.    Move the cursor to the character immediately to the right of the character you want to  delete. Press the Backspace key.   Learning Special Editing Techniques  371  Part IV Ch 15  Most people ﬁnd the ﬁrst method more natural. Try both methods and make your own choice.  Splitting and Joining Lines  Sometimes you need to split a line of text into two lines. To do so, move the cursor so that it is positioned under the character with which you want to begin the second line of text; then press Enter. The line splits in two, and the second half moves down to form a new line. Succeeding lines are pushed down to accommodate the new line.  Conversely, you can join two lines to form one line. To do so, position the cursor in the sec- ond line and press Home to move the cursor to the left end of the line. Then, press Backspace. The second line moves up to the right end of the ﬁrst line. Lines beneath the split line move up one line.  Inserting and Deleting an Entire Line  To insert a blank line between two lines, move the cursor to column 1 in the lower of the two lines and then press Ctrl+N or Home  to move the cursor to the left end of the current line , and press Enter. Then, move the cursor up to the new blank line.  To delete an entire line, place the cursor anywhere on the line and press Ctrl+Y.  Overtyping  By default, the DOS Editor operates in Insert mode. If you type new text while the cursor is in the middle of a line, the Editor inserts that new text at the cursor location. If you prefer, you can choose Overtype mode, in which the new text replaces the former text.  To activate Overtype mode, press Insert. The cursor changes from a blinking line to a blink- ing box. The larger cursor signiﬁes Overtype mode, in which any new character you type replaces the character at the cursor location.  Depending on your keyboard, you might have a key marked either Ins or Insert. Both pro- vide the insert function.  To return to standard Insert mode, press Insert again. The Insert key acts as a toggle switch that alternates between Insert and Overtype modes.  Learning Special Editing Techniques  In addition to the basic editing techniques, the DOS Editor provides several special editing features. The following sections describe how to use the automatic indenting, tab, and place marker features.   372  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  Using Automatic Indent  When you type a line and press Enter, the cursor drops down one line but returns to the column where you began the preceding line. This feature is convenient when you want to type a series of indented lines.  For an example, type the following line and press Enter: This line is not indented  The cursor moves to the beginning of the next line. Then press the spacebar three times to move the cursor to column 4 and type the following: But this line is  Press Enter again. Note that the second time you press Enter, the cursor moves to the next row but remains indented at column 4. Now type this message and press Enter: So is this one  The cursor remains indented.  Now press the left-arrow key until the cursor returns to column 1. Type the following and press Enter: Back to no indentation  The short text block you typed looks like the following: This line is not indented  But this line is So is this one  Back to no indentation  Using Tab  By default, tab stops are set every eight spaces. When you press the Tab key, the cursor moves to the right to the next tab stop. All text to the right of the cursor moves right when you press Tab. Additional tabbing techniques follow:    To indent an existing line a full tab position, move the cursor to column 1 of the line    To remove leading spaces and move a line to the left, move the cursor anywhere on the  and press Tab.  line and then press Shift+Tab.    To indent or “unindent” an entire block of lines, select the lines by using one of the Shift keystrokes shown in Table 15.4. Then, press Tab to indent the entire block or press Shift+Tab to “unindent” the entire block.    To change the number of default tab stops, ﬁrst select Display from the Options menu.  In the resulting dialog box, press Tab several times to move the cursor to Tab Stops, type a new value for the number of characters per tab stop, and then press Enter to close the dialog box.   Block Editing  373  Using Place Markers  A place marker designates a speciﬁc location—a row and column—in your text. You can set as many as four place markers. After setting a place marker, you can move the cursor instantly from anywhere in the ﬁle to that marker’s location. The markers are invisible; no character appears in the text to indicate a set marker.  You can set four markers: 0 through 3. To set a place marker, press and release Ctrl+K, and then press a number key from 0 to 3. This action associates the cursor’s current position with the marker having the number whose key you pressed. To move the cursor to a previ- ously set place marker, press and release Ctrl+Q, and then press the number of the marker  0 through 3 .  You don’t turn off markers; they are always set. You can reset them to a different location, but you cannot unset them. They are forgotten when you exit the program.  Part IV Ch 15  Block Editing  You can edit blocks of text as a single unit. Block editing requires that you understand two relevant concepts: selecting text and using the Clipboard, which temporarily stores a block of text in a reserved area of memory.  The following sections describe these techniques:    Selecting text for block operations   Using the Clipboard   Cutting and pasting blocks of text  Selecting Text  A block of selected text is always one contiguous group of characters. The block can be one character, a few characters, a line, several lines, a paragraph, or even an entire ﬁle. Selected text appears in reverse video.  Follow these steps to select a block of text:  1. Move the cursor to one end of the block. 2. While you hold down the Shift key, use the cursor-movement keys to highlight the  block.  Table 15.4 lists the keys used for selecting text. In general, the keys you use to select text are the same as those you use to move the cursor, but you also press Shift when using them to select text.   374  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  Table 15.4  Selecting Text  To Select Character left  Character right  To beginning of line  To end of line  Current line  Line above  Word left  Word right  Screen up  Screen down  To beginning of text  To end of text  Use This Key Combination Shift+left arrow  Shift+right arrow  Shift+Home  Shift+End  Shift+down arrow  Shift+up arrow  Shift+Ctrl+left arrow  Shift+Ctrl+right arrow  Shift+PgUp  Shift+PgDn  Shift+Ctrl+Home  Shift+Ctrl+End  After you select  highlight  a block, you can deselect it by pressing any arrow key.  Do not use Shift, however; Shift expands or shrinks the selection.  The highlighting disappears, indicating that you have deselected the entire block.  Understanding the Clipboard  The Clipboard is a text storage area in memory; it acts as a kind of halfway house for blocks of text. You can place a block of text into the Clipboard and later retrieve the block. The Clipboard has many uses. Its most common use is to cut and paste—to move or copy a block of text from one place in the ﬁle to another.  The Clipboard stores only one block of text at a time. When you place text in the Clipboard, the incoming text completely replaces the previous contents of the Clipboard. Changing the block of text in the Clipboard is always an all-or-nothing affair. You cannot add or subtract incrementally. Similarly, retrieval is all or nothing. You cannot move only part of the Clipboard’s contents into your ﬁle.  Working with Text Blocks  The DOS Editor supports four block-oriented editing techniques  see Table 15.5 . You can access each technique by using the Edit menu or pressing the appropriate shortcut key.  Press Alt+E to activate the Edit menu.    Block Editing  375  Part IV Ch 15  Table 15.5 Block-Editing Techniques  Menu Command Cut  Shortcut Key Shift+Del  Copy  Paste  Clear  Ctrl+Ins  Shift+Ins  Del  Description Deletes selected text from a ﬁle and places that text in the Clipboard.  Places in the Clipboard a copy of selected text from the ﬁle; text in the ﬁle remains selected.  Inserts the contents of the Clipboard into the ﬁle at the cursor location; Clipboard contents remain intact. If the ﬁle currently has selected text, Clipboard text replaces the selected text.  Deletes selected text from the ﬁle; the contents of the Clipboard are not affected.  To select the ﬁrst three lines of text in a ﬁle, for example, press Ctrl+Home to return the cursor to the beginning of the ﬁle. While you’re holding down the Shift key, press the down-arrow key three times to select the ﬁrst three lines of the ﬁle. They now appear in reverse video  highlighted .  After the three lines are selected, you can use one of the block-editing commands. To  activate the Edit menu, press Alt+E. The DOS Editor displays the Edit menu shown in Figure 15.4. You can now use one of the menu commands.  You can use one of the shortcut keys to operate on the selected block, even without dis- playing the Edit menu.  Figure 15.4 The Edit menu enables you to cut, copy, paste, and clear text.  When you perform copy operations, a copy of the selected text moves to the Clipboard but isn’t deleted from the original location. If you perform a cut command, however, the DOS Editor removes the highlighted text from its original location and places it in the Clipboard.   376  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  After text has been copied or cut to the Clipboard, you can use the paste operation to copy the Clipboard’s contents to a new location in the ﬁle. To do so, move the cursor to the desired target location and choose Paste from the Edit menu, or press Shift+Ins  the short- cut key for Paste . The Editor inserts a copy of the Clipboard text at the cursor’s location.  The Clipboard still holds a copy of the pasted text. You can insert additional copies of the Clipboard text at other locations in the ﬁle by using the Edit menu or pressing Ctrl+C.  Pressing Del or choosing the Clear command from the Edit menu permanently deletes the selected text from the ﬁle without placing a copy of it in the Clipboard.  Searching and Replacing  The Search menu offers several options for searching for and replacing text. These capabili- ties are most useful in long ﬁles.  From the Search menu, you can perform the following actions:    Find one or more occurrences of a designated text string   Replace one or more occurrences of a designated text string with a second text string  A text string is a sequence of one or more consecutive text characters. These characters can be letters, digits, punctuation, or special symbols—any characters you can type from the keyboard.  Finding or replacing text always involves a search string, which is simply the text string being searched for. A search string can be a single character or, more likely, a word or sev- eral consecutive characters.  You cannot search for a string that spans two or more lines. The search string is conﬁned to a group of characters on a single line. You can place some conditions on the search string, however. You can specify, for example, that the search not discriminate between upper- and lowercase letters.  The search begins at the cursor’s location and proceeds through the ﬁle. If the end of the ﬁle is reached before the search string is found, the search continues at the top of the ﬁle until the entire ﬁle has been traversed. Table 15.6 summarizes the three commands available from the Search menu.   Searching and Replacing  377  Table 15.6 Search Menu Commands  Command Find  Shortcut Key None  Description Opens a dialog box in which you specify the search string; ﬁnds the search string in your ﬁle  Repeat Last Find  F3  Searches for the text speciﬁed in the last Find command  Change  None  Replaces one text string with another  Part IV Ch 15  Using the Find Command  To use the Find command, ﬁrst activate the Search menu by pressing Alt+S. Your screen looks similar to Figure 15.5.  Figure 15.5 Using the Search menu, you can ﬁnd text, repeat a ﬁnd, and change text.  Figure 15.6 The Find dialog box enables you to search for text.  Choose Find. The Find dialog box opens, with the cursor on the Find What text box  see Figure 15.6 . The word that is at the cursor’s current location in the ﬁle  or the currently selected text  appears in the text box. If you want to search for this word, press Enter. Otherwise, type the correct search string and then press Enter. The DOS Editor locates the ﬁrst occurrence of the search string in your ﬁle and selects  highlights  the text found.  ➔ For more information on using wildcards, see Chapter 5, “Understanding Files and Directories,” p. 99.   378  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  You can press F3 or choose Repeat Last Find from the Search menu. The Editor moves to the next occurrence of the search string  if any .  As you can see in Figure 15.6, you can use the following check boxes in the dialog box to place conditions on the search:    Match Upper Lowercase—If you select this check box, a successful search occurs only  when the upper- and lowercase letters in the text exactly match those in the search string. If this option is not selected, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same.    Whole Word—If you select this option, the search string must exist as an independent  word and cannot be embedded inside a larger word. The character that immediately precedes and immediately follows the search string must be a space, a punctuation char- acter, or one of the special characters  such as <, *, or [ .  Using the Change Command  In addition to just searching for text, you can use the DOS Editor to search for speciﬁc text and then replace it with other text.  You activate the Search menu by pressing Alt+S. Then, choose the Change command. The Editor displays the Change dialog box  see Figure 15.7 .  The ﬁrst text box in the Change dialog box is labeled Find What. Type the text you want the Editor to ﬁnd in this text box  the target text . The second text box is labeled Change To. Type the text you want entered. Figure 15.8 shows a completed Change dialog box.  Figure 15.7 The Change dialog box enables you to search and replace text.  Figure 15.8 The ﬁrst step in per- forming a search-and- replace operation is to ﬁll in the Find What and Change To boxes.   Managing Files  379  Part IV Ch 15  This dialog box contains two check boxes: Match Upper Lowercase and Whole Word. Refer to the preceding section for a discussion of these check boxes.  After you make the appropriate entries in the text boxes and select any desired check boxes, choose from among the following three command buttons:    Find and Verify—Select this button to ﬁnd each occurrence of the target string, one  after another.  You specify the target string in the Find What dialog box.  As each occurrence of the target string is found, a second dialog box opens. This second box gives you the choice of making the substitution, skipping to the next occurrence, or canceling the remaining searches. Find and Verify is the default option, which you auto- matically choose by pressing Enter.    Change All—This button changes all occurrences of the target string to the string  speciﬁed in the Change To box. The changes occur all at once. A dialog box informs you when the substitutions are complete.    Cancel—This button aborts the Change command, closing the dialog box without  making any substitutions. This option is equivalent to pressing Esc.  After the DOS Editor ﬁnishes the search-and-replace operation, it displays a second dialog box, which contains the message Change complete. If no matching text can be found, the box displays the message Match not found. Choose the OK command button to return to the Editor window.  Managing Files  The DOS Editor includes many functions you can use to manage ﬁles. These functions, although primitive by the standards of today’s full-blown word processors, enable you to perform the basics of ﬁle management. The following sections cover, in detail, the ﬁle- management operations you can perform using the DOS Editor.  Introducing the File Menu  The File menu is your command center for loading and saving ﬁles. Six commands are available on the File menu  see Figure 15.9 .  Figure 15.9 The File menu enables you to access the ﬁle-management functions of the DOS Editor.   380  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  The following list explains the File menu commands:    New—Clears the ﬁle currently in the DOS Editor. The result is a clean slate, as though  you had just initialized the Editor. This command does not affect other copies of the ﬁle. If the ﬁle was saved on disk previously, for example, DOS does not erase the disk copy, only the working copy in the Editor.    Open—Loads a ﬁle from disk into the DOS Editor environment. You can use this  command to see a list of ﬁlenames in any directory.    Save—Saves the current ﬁle to disk.   Save As—Saves the current ﬁle to disk after prompting you for the ﬁlename.   Print—Prints all or part of the text in the DOS Editor environment.   Exit—Ends the editing session and returns you to the DOS Shell or the command-line  prompt.  When you are working with ﬁles, keep in mind these maxims:    Until you name a ﬁle, the Editor displays the temporary name Untitled in the   title bar.    When you save a ﬁle, the Editor adds the extension TXT to the ﬁlename if you  don’t specify another extension.     If you try to exit the Editor or open a new ﬁle without ﬁrst saving a working ﬁle in the Editor, a dialog box opens to warn you.  Saving a File  When you save a ﬁle for the ﬁrst time, you should specify two ﬁle attributes: the ﬁle path  the directory or disk on which to save the ﬁle  and the ﬁlename.  The DOS Editor stores ﬁles on disk in ASCII format. Such ﬁles are text ﬁles that most text editors and word processors can manipulate. You can view ASCII ﬁles directly from the DOS command line by using the TYPE command.  Using the Save As Command Follow these steps to save the current Untitled ﬁle with a new ﬁlename:  1. Choose Save As from the File menu. In the dialog box that opens, the current path is  shown below the words File Name  see Figure 15.10 . A list box, below the label Dirs Drives, lists the directories and disk drives available on your system.  2. Type the new ﬁlename in the File Name box. You can specify any ﬁle extension as part  of the ﬁlename. Typical ﬁle extensions for ASCII text ﬁles are TXT and DOC.  3. Press Enter to save the ﬁle.   Figure 15.10 The Save As dialog box appears when you ﬁrst save a ﬁle or when you save a ﬁle under a new name.  Managing Files  381  Part IV Ch 15  The DOS Editor saves the ﬁle to disk in the directory speciﬁed by the current path.  Save As is commonly used for storing a ﬁle the ﬁrst time you create it and for saving a sec- ond version of a ﬁle in a different directory or with a name different from the ﬁrst version. Assume that you are editing a ﬁle named MYWORK.TXT. After making a few changes, you decide to save the new version of the ﬁle under the name MEAGAIN.TXT. To do so, display the File menu and choose Save As. The DOS Editor displays the Save As dialog box.  The File Name text box contains the current ﬁlename, MYWORK.TXT. Type MEAGAIN.TXT and press Enter. The DOS Editor stores the ﬁle on disk as MEAGAIN.TXT, changing the name in the title bar accordingly. The ﬁle MYWORK.TXT remains stored on disk. Remember that if you continue editing the ﬁle onscreen, you are editing MEAGAIN.TXT  as indicated in the title bar , not MYWORK.TXT.  To store a ﬁle in a directory other than that speciﬁed by the current path, type the new directory path as part of the ﬁlename. If you type the ﬁlename \MEMOS\PLAN.BID, for exam- ple, the DOS Editor stores the ﬁle with the name PLAN.BID in the directory \MEMOS. After you save the ﬁle, the name PLAN.BID appears in the title bar. The next time you issue the Save As command, the default directory path is speciﬁed in the dialog box as C:\MEMOS. If you save a new ﬁle without including an explicit path, DOS saves the ﬁle in the C:\MEMOS directory.  You can use this technique to save ﬁles on different disk drives. To save a ﬁle named MYFILE.TXT in the root directory of the disk in drive A, for example, type the ﬁlename as A:\MYFILE.TXT.  Using the Save Command You use Save to store a ﬁle you have already named. No dialog box appears. The current version of the ﬁle in the DOS Editor is saved to disk under the existing ﬁlename. As you edit a ﬁle, use Save periodically to update the ﬁle on disk.   382  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  Using Save on an unnamed  untitled  ﬁle has nearly the same effect as using Save As; the Editor opens a dialog box similar to that shown in Figure 15.10 so that you can enter a ﬁle- name.  Using the Open Command to Load a File  After text ﬁles are stored on disk, you can load a ﬁle into the DOS Editor by using the Open command. Because this command lists ﬁles in any directory, you also can use Open to search your directories for speciﬁc ﬁlenames. When you choose Open, the Open dialog box appears  see Figure 15.11 .  Figure 15.11 The Open dialog box enables you to load an existing disk ﬁle.  The Open dialog box contains a File Name text box. By default, this box contains *.TXT, the wildcard ﬁlename for all ﬁles with the extension TXT. The current directory path  C:\DOS in Figure 15.11  appears below the File Name text box. In the File Name text box, type a ﬁle- name, directory path, or name using the * and ? wildcard characters.  To change the default path, specify a path in the File Name text box and press Enter. Otherwise, the DOS Editor looks in the current directory for ﬁles with the extension TXT.  The Files list box contains the names of all ﬁles that satisfy the current directory, path, and ﬁlename speciﬁcation. In Figure 15.11, the Files box shows all ﬁles that satisfy the path and ﬁlename speciﬁcation C:\DOS\*.TXT.  The Dirs Drives list box lists available directories and disks. You can move the cursor to the Dirs Drives list box by pressing Tab repeatedly. Then, press the up- and down-arrow keys to move the highlight to one of the directories or drives listed in the box. Press Enter to change the default path.  To load a speciﬁc ﬁle into the DOS Editor, you can use the File Name box or Files box. To use the File Name box, type in the box the name of the speciﬁc ﬁle, including a path  or rely on the default path shown below the box . If you don’t specify an extension, the Editor assumes the TXT extension. To load the ﬁle MYFILE.TXT, which is in the current directory, for example, type MYFILE and press Enter.   Managing Files  383  Part IV Ch 15  You also can select a ﬁlename from the Files list box if it contains the ﬁlename you want. First, press Tab to move the cursor to the Files list box. Then, use the arrow keys to high- light the target ﬁlename. Alternatively, you can press the ﬁrst letter of the ﬁlename to move the highlight. When the name you want is highlighted, press Enter. The DOS Editor loads the ﬁle so that you can edit or view it.  Loading a File When You First Start the DOS Editor  You can load a ﬁle when you ﬁrst start the DOS Editor. To do so, use the following syntax: EDIT filename  filename is the name of the ﬁle you want to edit. Include the path if the ﬁle isn’t in the cur- rent directory. To start the Editor with the ﬁle \SALES\MYFILE.TXT loaded, for example, type the following line: EDIT \SALES\MYFILE.TXT  The following notes apply when you load a ﬁle when you start the DOS Editor:    The Editor does not assume the extension TXT or any other extension if you don’t spec-  ify an extension as part of the ﬁlename.    The Editor initializes directly without taking the intermediate step of asking whether  you want to see the help material in the onscreen Survival Guide.    If the Editor cannot locate the speciﬁed ﬁle, it assumes that you want to create a new ﬁle with that name. Accordingly, the Editor initializes with a fresh slate that includes your designated ﬁlename in the title bar. After you enter data into the ﬁle, you can save it directly by using the Save command.  You don’t have to use Save As and specify the ﬁlename a second time.   Using the New Command  Use New when you want to stop work on one ﬁle and create a new ﬁle. If you haven’t saved the old ﬁle, the DOS Editor opens a dialog box for conﬁrmation. Otherwise, the old ﬁle is cleared, and the screen looks as though you had just initiated the Editor. You see a blank editing area with Untitled in the title bar.  Printing a File  Your computer system probably includes a printer. Whether you have a dot-matrix, inkjet, or laser printer, follow these steps to print a copy of the ﬁle currently loaded in the Editor. You can print selected text or the complete ﬁle.  1. Activate the File menu. 2. Choose Print to open the Print dialog box  see Figure 15.12 .   384  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  Figure 15.12 The Print dialog box appears every time you choose the Print command from the File menu.  3. Choose one of the following option buttons:  Selected Text Only—Prints only selected text, which appears in reverse video in the Editor.  Selecting text is explained earlier in this chapter.  This option is the default when a block of text is selected. Complete Document—Prints the entire ﬁle. This option is the default when no text is selected.  4. Press Enter to begin printing. Make sure that your printer is turned on and is online.  Exiting the DOS Editor  After you ﬁnish editing ﬁles, you might want to leave the DOS Editor. Just display the File menu and choose the Exit command. If the ﬁle already has been saved, the Editor returns to the DOS Shell or to the command line, depending on how you started the program.  If you try to quit without ﬁrst saving the document you have been editing, the Editor opens a dialog box to ask whether you want to save the ﬁle. Choose Yes to save the ﬁle and exit the Editor. Choose No to exit from the Editor without saving any changes to the current ﬁle. Choose Cancel to close the dialog box and return to the Editor. To get help informa- tion about the dialog box, choose Help.  Starting the DOS Editor with Optional Switches  When you start the DOS Editor, four special parameter switches are available. These switches are listed in Table 15.7.  Table 15.7 Optional Switches for the EDIT Command  Switch   B   G  Description Displays the DOS Editor in black and white, even when a color graphics adapter is present.  Updates Editor screens as quickly as possible on systems with CGA  Color Graphics Adapter  video.  Note: Some computer systems cannot support this option. If screen ﬂicker occurs when you choose  G, your hardware is not compatible with this option. Also, any system with VGA or better does not need to use this option.    Project: Customizing the DOS Editor Screen  385  Table 15.7 Continued  Switch   H  Description Displays the maximum number of lines possible with your video hardware. EGA  Enhanced Graphics Adapter  and VGA  Video Graphics Array  systems can produce more than the standard number of lines onscreen.   NOHI  Effectively displays the Editor on monitors that do not support high intensity.  To display the maximum number of lines when starting the DOS Editor, for example, use the following command: EDIT  H  You can specify a ﬁlename with one of the command options, as in the following example: EDIT \SALES\MYFILE  H  Use the  B switch if you run the DOS Editor on a computer system with a color video adapter but a black-and-white monitor. At the DOS prompt, activate the Editor as follows: EDIT  B  Project: Customizing the DOS Editor Screen  Colors on the DOS Editor screen are preset. You can customize most of these colors and other attributes from the Options menu by using the Display command. If you have a color system, you might want different colors for the foreground and background text. If you don’t use a mouse with the Editor, you might want to remove the scrollbars.  Changing Colors and Removing Scrollbars  To change screen colors in the DOS Editor, display the Options menu and choose Display. A dialog box similar to the one in Figure 15.13 opens.  Figure 15.13 The Display dialog box enables you to customize how the Editor screen appears.   386  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor  With the cursor on the Foreground box, you can select a new foreground text color by pressing the up- and down-arrow keys. The Foreground box cycles through the colors avail- able with your video hardware. Notice that as you press the arrow keys, the text to the left of the dialog box  Set Colors for the Text Editor Window  shows the current foreground and background colors. Select a new foreground color by moving the highlight to the color you want. Don’t press Enter yet. You have more selections to make before closing this dia- log box.  Press Tab to move the cursor to the Background box. Select a new background color; the process is similar to the one you followed to select a new foreground color. Now press Enter to return to the Editor screen. The new colors should be in use.  If you don’t use a mouse, you might want to consider removing the scrollbars from your screen. Many users think that the screen looks less cluttered without the scrollbars. To see which you prefer, try the following exercise:  1. Reopen the dialog box by displaying the Options menu and choosing Display. 2. Press Tab several times to move the cursor to the Scroll Bars check box. The X inside  the brackets indicates that scrollbars are displayed.  3. Press the spacebar or S to deselect the check box. Removing the X indicates that you  want to deselect the display of scrollbars.  4. Press Enter, and the scrollbars disappear  see Figure 15.14 .  Figure 15.14 The scrollbars have been removed from this Editor screen.  Saving Customized Settings  If you change one or more display options, the DOS Editor creates a ﬁle named QBASIC.INI and stores it in the directory containing the EDIT.COM and QBASIC.EXE ﬁles.  For most sys- tems, this directory is \DOS.  The QBASIC.INI ﬁle contains a record of the new screen conﬁg- uration. When you later restart, the Editor uses QBASIC.INI to restore the screen with your customized settings.   Project: Customizing the DOS Editor Screen  387  Every time you start the Editor, it looks for QBASIC.INI in the default directory or in the directory chain established by the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle. If you restart from a different directory, be sure that the Editor has access to the QBASIC.INI ﬁle.  If you want to start the Editor with the original screen conﬁguration, simply erase the  QBASIC.INI ﬁle.  The DOS Editor “borrows” the programming editor from the QBASIC.EXE ﬁle. Thus, the DOS Editor shares the editing environment found in the QBasic programming language. Similarly, the DOS Editor and QBasic share the initial conﬁguration ﬁle  QBASIC.INI . Whether you run the DOS Editor or QBasic, the initial conﬁguration is saved in the  QBASIC.INI ﬁle.  Using the Help System  The DOS Editor provides online help through the Help menu  see Figure 15.15 . Help screens include information about menus and commands, shortcut keys, dialog boxes, key- board actions, and even about the help system itself.  Figure 15.15 The Help menu helps you learn to use the DOS Editor.  Three categories of information are available from the Help menu:    Getting Started—Provides information about starting the Editor, using the menu and  command system, and requesting help    Keyboard—Explains the different editing keystrokes and shortcuts for moving the cur-  sor around your text ﬁle    About—Shows the Editor version number and copyright information  The following are general notes on using the Help system:    To activate the Help system at any time, press Alt+H.   To move the cursor to the next help topic, press Tab. When the cursor is on the topic  you want, press Enter to view the help screen.   388  Chapter 15 Using the DOS Editor    To activate the Getting Started help menu at any time, press Shift+F1.   To close a help window and exit the help system, press Esc.   A help screen opens in a separate window. The title bar of this window shows the help  topic on display. If you request help on the Save command from the File menu, for example, the title bar of the help window reads HELP: Save command.    The F1 key provides express help. To get help on any menu, command, or dialog box,  press F1 when the cursor or highlight is on the desired item.    For help when an error message occurs, move the cursor to the Help option in the  error message box and press Enter.    Sometime, at your leisure, consider browsing through all the help screens. To browse,  press Shift+F1 and then press Ctrl+F1 repeatedly.    To scroll any particular help screen, press PgUp or PgDn.   When help is active, a separate help window opens in addition to the Editor window.  You can move the cursor between the help and Editor windows by pressing F6  or Shift+F6 .    When a help window and Editor window are open simultaneously, you can enlarge or reduce the size of the active window by pressing Alt+plus or Alt+minus.  Here, plus and minus refer to the + and – keys on the numeric keypad.     To cut and paste text from a help screen into your ﬁle, ﬁrst use the normal editing keys  to select the text on the help screen. Copy the selected lines to the Clipboard. Press  F6 to activate the Editor window and then, using the normal editing keys, paste the help text into your ﬁle. Now reactivate the help screen by pressing F6 again.    When the help system is active, as in all editing contexts, the status bar at the bottom of the screen displays useful keystrokes. If you want to execute a command shown enclosed in angle brackets, press the indicated keystroke or click the mouse when the mouse cur- sor is on the command name in the status bar.    The Editor keeps track of the last 20 help screens you have viewed. To cycle back  through previously viewed screens, press Alt+F1.    When you start the Editor, the initial dialog box gives you the option of seeing the  Survival Guide. If you press Enter to see the Guide, the help system is activated. A help screen displays information about getting started with the Editor and using the help system.    The Editor stores the text of the help screens in a ﬁle named EDIT.HLP. To display any help screen, the Editor must have access to this ﬁle. The Editor searches for EDIT.HLP in the current directory or in directories speciﬁed by the PATH statement of your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle. Normal DOS installation automatically places this ﬁle in the default \DOS directory. If, for some reason, EDIT.HLP is located outside your PATH speciﬁcations, however, you can supply the Editor with the path to EDIT.HLP by choosing the Help Path command from the Options menu.

Your computer can per- form most tasks faster than you can, and it doesn’t make mistakes.  DOS has always enabled you to automate your use of DOS commands by creating batch ﬁles. A batch ﬁle is a text  ASCII  ﬁle containing a series of commands that you want DOS to execute. When you type the batch ﬁlename, DOS executes these commands in the order they occur within the batch ﬁle.  The idea of getting a computer to perform work in convenient, manageable batches pre- dates the personal computer by several years. The earliest computers were large and expen- sive, and they could do only one job at a time. But even these early machines were fast. Making them wait for keyboard input between jobs was inefﬁcient.  Batch processing was developed to make computers more productive. Collections of tasks to be carried out consecutively were put together ofﬂine—that is, without using the computer’s resources. The chunks, or batches, of tasks then were fed to the computer at a rate that kept the computer busy and productive.  Today, computers are less expensive than human resources. Batch processing enables com- puters to carry out a series of tasks automatically so that people don’t have to waste time typing frequently used or complex commands.  A batch ﬁle is a text ﬁle that contains a series of DOS commands. Most commands used in batch ﬁles are familiar to you, having been explained in previous chapters of this book. Other commands, which control the ﬂow of action during batch processing are available for use only in batch ﬁles. DOS executes the commands in a batch ﬁle one line at a time, treat- ing each command as though you issued it individually.  You can use batch ﬁles to automate a DOS process. Using a set of commands in a batch ﬁle, you actually create a new, more powerful command. After a few experiments, you will ﬁnd this DOS feature quite handy.  Recognizing a batch ﬁle in a directory listing is easy; batch ﬁles always have the ﬁlename extension BAT. You can execute a batch ﬁle by typing the ﬁlename at the DOS prompt and then pressing Enter. To execute the batch ﬁle SAFE.BAT, for example, you type the following at the DOS prompt and press Enter: SAFE  COMMAND.COM looks in the current directory for a ﬁle named SAFE.COM, then SAFE.EXE, and ﬁnally SAFE.BAT. After ﬁnding the ﬁle, it reads and executes the DOS commands the ﬁle contains.  Batch ﬁles are useful for issuing frequently used commands whose parameters you have trouble remembering. For example, you can run the Backup program by typing MSBACKUP and then selecting options from the program. But what if you have saved several sets of   Understanding the Contents of Batch Files  391  options in setup ﬁles for different circumstances? You can create batch ﬁles to run MSBACKUP with the proper setup ﬁle when you issue a simple command such as DAILYBAK.  Batch ﬁles can echo  display  messages that you designate. This text-display capability is  useful for presenting instructions or reminders onscreen. You can compose messages that describe how to execute a command or that contain syntax examples and reminders. Batch ﬁles also can use the TYPE command to display text from another ﬁle.  In some ways, batch ﬁles resemble computer programs. DOS has a host of special com- mands that are used primarily in batch ﬁles. Although you can type some of these com- mands at the DOS prompt, their main use is in batch ﬁles. These commands introduce ﬂow-control and simple decision-making capabilities into a batch ﬁle.  Part IV Ch 16  Understanding the Contents of Batch Files  Batch ﬁles consist entirely of ASCII text characters. You can create batch ﬁles in the DOS Editor, in Edlin, and in nearly any other text-editing or word processing program.  If you use a word processing program, you must use a setting that omits the special formatting and control characters that many such programs use for internal purposes.   The easiest way to create a short batch ﬁle, however, is to use the COPY command to redirect input from the keyboard  the CON device  to a ﬁle  see Chapter 8, “Managing Your Files,” for more information .  When you create batch ﬁles, observe the following rules:    Batch ﬁles must be ASCII ﬁles. If you use a word processing program, be sure that the  program saves the ﬁle without formatting characters.    The name of the batch ﬁle, which can be one to eight characters long, must conform to  DOS’s ﬁlename rules. Make batch ﬁlenames meaningful so that they are easier to remember.    The ﬁlename must end with the BAT extension.   The ﬁlename cannot be the same as a program ﬁlename  a ﬁle with an EXE or COM  extension .    The ﬁlename cannot be the same as an internal DOS command  such as COPY or DATE .   The batch ﬁle can contain any valid DOS commands that you can enter at the DOS  command line  for example – AUTOEXEC.BAT .  Typos cause errors.     You can include in the batch ﬁle any program name you usually type at the DOS com- mand line. DOS executes the program as though you had entered its name at the com- mand line.    Use only one command or program name per line in the batch ﬁle. DOS executes batch  ﬁles one line at a time.   392  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  You start a batch ﬁle by typing its ﬁlename  excluding the extension  at the DOS prompt and then pressing Enter. The following list summarizes the rules DOS follows when it exe- cutes a batch ﬁle:    When DOS encounters a syntax error in a batch ﬁle’s command line, DOS displays an error message, skips the incorrect command, and executes the remaining commands in the batch ﬁle.    You can stop a batch ﬁle by pressing Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break. DOS displays the following  prompt: Terminate batch job  Y N ? Type N to skip the current command  the one being carried out  and proceed to the next command in the batch ﬁle. Type Y to abort execution of the batch ﬁle and return to the DOS prompt.  Creating a Simple Batch File  Tasks consisting of the same series of commands are ideal candidates for batch ﬁles. One task that you might perform repetitively is copying and comparing ﬁles.  In this section, you create a simple batch ﬁle, using the COPY command to redirect input from the keyboard  the CON device  to create an ASCII text ﬁle.  Remember that you also can use the DOS Editor, Edlin, or another text-editing or word processing program to cre- ate ASCII text ﬁles.   Suppose that you often work with two spreadsheet ﬁles called SALES.WK1 and CUSTOMER.WK1. You frequently update these ﬁles and store them in the directory \STORE on drive C. After you update the ﬁles, you normally copy them to a disk in drive A and compare the copies on the ﬂoppy disk with the originals on the hard disk.  To begin creating a batch ﬁle that automates this process, type the following line at the DOS prompt and then press Enter: COPY CON COPYCOMP.BAT  This COPY command redirects console  keyboard  input to the ﬁle COPYCOMP.BAT. After you press Enter, DOS drops the cursor to the line below the DOS prompt at the left of the screen and then waits for further instructions. Type the following three lines, pressing Enter after each line: @ECHO OFF COPY C:\STORE A: FC C:\STORE A: L  After you enter the last line in the ﬁle, press F6 or Ctrl+Z  both ways produce the characters ^Z on the screen  to send a signal to DOS that the end of the ﬁle has been reached. Then, press Enter. DOS copies the three lines into a ﬁle named COPYCOMP.BAT and displays the fol- lowing message: 1 file s  copied   Understanding Replaceable Parameters  393  When you use COPY CON to create a text ﬁle, check each line before pressing Enter. You can use Backspace and the DOS command-line editing keys  listed in Chapter 3, “Using DOS Commands”  to edit the current line. After you press Enter, DOS moves the cursor down to the next line, and you cannot correct any errors in previous lines. You can abort the process without saving the ﬁle, however, by pressing Ctrl+C.  The ﬁrst line of the COPYCOMP batch ﬁle, @ECHO OFF, instructs DOS not to display the batch ﬁle’s commands as they are executed. In other words, when you run the batch ﬁle, you do not see the command lines themselves onscreen; you see only the results of their actions. The @ sign, just before the word ECHO, instructs DOS not to display that command line, either. Basically, all you need to remember is that @ stops display of the current line, whereas ECHO OFF stops display of all subsequent lines.  Part IV Ch 16  The second line of COPYCOMP.BAT copies the desired ﬁles from their source location in C:\STORE to the destination root directory of drive A.  The ﬁnal line of the batch ﬁle uses FC.EXE, an external DOS command that compares the copied ﬁles with the originals. Although you can use the  V  verify  switch with COPY, using FC is more thorough.  Now that the COPYCOMP.BAT batch ﬁle is complete, you can run the ﬁle by typing the follow- ing command at the DOS prompt and then pressing Enter: COPYCOMP  DOS ﬁrst copies the two ﬁles from the C:\STORE directory to drive A and then compares the copies with the original ﬁles.  Understanding Replaceable Parameters  The batch ﬁles discussed so far in this chapter carry out exactly the same functions every time you use them. You might want a particular batch ﬁle to operate on different ﬁles each time you use it, even though the commands in the batch ﬁle are ﬁxed. When you use replaceable parameters in a batch ﬁle, you can use the same commands to perform different tasks.  You already know that a parameter is an additional instruction that deﬁnes the task a DOS command will perform. When you type the name of the batch ﬁle at the DOS prompt, you can include up to nine parameters. DOS assigns a variable name to each parameter, starting with 1 and going up to 9.  DOS always assigns the variable name 0 to the name of the batch ﬁle itself.   You can use each variable in your batch ﬁle by preceding the variable name with the per- cent sign  % . This combination of the percent sign and variable name is called a replaceable parameter.   394  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  When used in a batch ﬁle, each replaceable parameter, numbered %0 through %9, holds the place for a parameter in one or more commands of a batch ﬁle so that you can provide the actual value of the parameter at the time you execute the batch ﬁle.  Consider the COPYCOMP.BAT batch ﬁle discussed earlier in this chapter: @ECHO OFF COPY C:\STORE A: FC C:\STORE A: L  Each time you execute this batch ﬁle, it copies all ﬁles from the C:\STORE directory to drive A and then compares the ﬁles. Suppose that you want to make this batch ﬁle more versatile so that you can use it to copy and compare the ﬁles in any directory. To do so, revise  COPYCOMP.BAT as follows: @ECHO OFF COPY %1 %2 FC %1 %2  L  Notice that %1 and %2 replace C:\STORE and A:, respectively. These parameters are the replaceable parameters.  After making these changes in COPYCOMP.BAT, you can use the batch ﬁle to copy and compare the ﬁles from any directory to any disk or directory. To copy and compare the ﬁles in the \SPREADSH\QPRO4DAT directory on drive C with the ﬁles on a disk in drive B, for example, type the following command and then press Enter: COPYCOMP C:\SPREADSH\QPRO4DAT B:  DOS copies all ﬁles from C:\SPREADSH\QPRO4DAT to the disk in drive B and then compares the original ﬁles with the copies to ensure that the copy procedure was effective.  To see how DOS replaces the parameters, create a batch ﬁle called TEST1.BAT that contains the following single line: @ECHO %0 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9  After you create this ﬁle, type TEST1, followed by one space. Then, type your ﬁrst name, last name, street address, city, state, ZIP Code, and age, with each entry separated by spaces. Then, press Enter. Your screen should look similar to the following: C\:>TEST1 DAVID SMITH 1234 PINE STREET ANYTOWN IN 46032 39 TEST1 DAVID SMITH 1234 PINE STREET ANYTOWN IN 46032 39 C\:>  The batch ﬁle command instructs DOS to display the parameters 0 through 9. In the  preceding example, these parameters are the following:  Parameter  %0 %1 %2 %3  Word  TEST1 DAVID SMITH 1234   Understanding Replaceable Parameters  395  Parameter  %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9  Word  PINE STREET ANYTOWN IN 46032 39  Part IV Ch 16  Now try to “shortchange” DOS by not specifying a sufﬁcient number of parameters to ﬁll every variable marker. Run TEST1 again, but this time, type only your ﬁrst name. Your screen should resemble the following example: C>TEST1 DAVID TEST1 DAVID C>  DOS displays the batch ﬁlename and your ﬁrst name. No other information is echoed to the screen. You speciﬁed fewer parameters, and DOS replaced the unﬁlled markers with noth- ing. In this case, the empty markers did no harm.  Some commands you use in a batch ﬁle, however, might require that a replaceable parame- ter contain a value. If you include DEL in a batch ﬁle with a replaceable parameter and the parameter is empty, you see the following error message: Invalid number of parameters  You can use the IF command  discussed later in this chapter  to avert such errors. In the remainder of this section, you learn how to construct a batch ﬁle that takes advantage of replaceable parameters.  Suppose that you use several computers daily, but one of the hard disk systems is your “workhorse,” where you store all the ﬁles you want to keep. You use ﬂoppy disks to move information from computer to computer. After copying a ﬁle back to a hard disk, you usu- ally delete the ﬁle from the ﬂoppy disk. Deleting the ﬁle removes it from the process so that the ﬁle is not accidentally copied to the hard disk again later. You use the following steps to transfer data from a ﬂoppy disk to a hard disk:  1. Copy the ﬁle from the ﬂoppy disk to the hard disk with the verify switch on. 2. Erase the ﬁle from the ﬂoppy disk.  To simplify this process, you can create a batch ﬁle called C&E.BAT  copy and erase . Type the following commands in the ﬁle: COPY A:%1 C:%2  V DEL A:%1  To use the C&E.BAT ﬁle, type the following command at the DOS prompt: C&E oldfilename newfilename   396  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  The ﬁrst parameter, oldfilename, represents the name of the ﬁle you want to copy from the ﬂoppy disk to the hard disk; newfilename is the new name for the copied ﬁle  if you want to change the ﬁlename as the ﬁle is being copied .  Suppose that you put a disk containing the ﬁle NOTES.TXT into drive A and want to copy the ﬁle to the hard disk. Type the following command at the DOS prompt: C&E NOTES.TXT  The screen appears as follows: C>COPY A:NOTES.TXT C:  V 1 file s  copied C>DEL A:NOTES.TXT C>  Notice that even though you didn’t type the parameter newfilename, DOS carried out the batch ﬁle, keeping the same ﬁlename during the copy. DOS copied NOTES.TXT from drive A to drive C and then deleted the ﬁle on the disk in drive A. The %2 parameter was dropped, and the ﬁle did not get a new name during the copy operation.  One beneﬁt of creating a batch ﬁle that copies a ﬁle using parameters is that you can use a pathname as the second parameter. By specifying a pathname, you can copy the ﬁle from the ﬂoppy disk to a different directory on the hard disk. To copy NOTES.TXT to the WORDS direc- tory, for example, type the following command: C&E NOTES.TXT \WORDS  The screen display is as follows: C>COPY A:NOTES.TXT C:\WORDS  V 1 file s  copied C>DEL A:NOTES.TXT C>  Because \WORDS is a directory name, DOS copies the ﬁle NOTES.TXT into the directory \WORDS, following the rules of syntax for the COPY command. The batch ﬁle takes advantage of these syntax rules.  Time to Learn Patience and persistence are important in understanding batch ﬁles. Many PC users who tried to avoid using batch ﬁles ﬁnally experimented with one or two examples; these users picked up the concept rapidly and now produce batch ﬁles that anyone would be proud to have created. Give yourself a chance to learn batch ﬁles by completing the exercises in this chapter. You can use the sample batch ﬁles as templates and apply them to speciﬁc situations. When you learn how to compose batch ﬁles, you have harnessed one of DOS’s most power- ful features.  Even if you don’t regularly create your own batch ﬁles, you can use your knowledge of batch ﬁle principles. Many programs are started by batch ﬁles rather than by the name of the actual program ﬁle. With your knowledge of batch ﬁles, you can use the TYPE command to display the contents of any batch ﬁle so that you can see what the batch operation is doing.   Using Batch File Commands  397  Many software programs use the commands in an installation batch ﬁle to install the main ﬁles. You can understand how an installation proceeds if you read the installation batch ﬁle. Knowing what the batch ﬁle does can help you avert installation conﬂicts. Suppose that you use drive B to install a program supplied on a 5 1 4-inch disk because your drive A is a 3 1 2-inch drive. Many installation batch ﬁles, however, assume that the ﬁles are to be installed from drive A. To prevent this conﬂict, you can modify a version of the installation batch ﬁle by changing all instances of A to B. When you run your modiﬁed installation batch ﬁle, you can install the new software without a hitch.  Working with batch ﬁles also can serve as a meaningful introduction to programming. The batch ﬁle commands covered in this chapter give batch ﬁles the kind of internal ﬂow and decision-making capabilities that programming languages offer. Of course, don’t expect batch ﬁles to equal the versatility of a full-featured programming environment. But batch ﬁles certainly can assume a programming ﬂavor. By using batch ﬁles, you can increase DOS’s usefulness signiﬁcantly.  Part IV Ch 16  Using Batch File Commands  DOS includes special commands that often are used in batch ﬁles. Table 16.1 lists batch ﬁle commands.  Table 16.1 Batch File Commands  Command  Action Suppresses the display of the command line onscreen  Runs another batch ﬁle and returns to the original batch ﬁle  Halts processing until a speciﬁed key is pressed  use the IF ERRORLEVEL com- mand to determine which key was pressed   Turns on or off the display of batch commands as they execute; also can display a message onscreen  FOR..IN..DO  Permits the use of the same batch command for several ﬁles  the execution “loops”   Jumps to the line following the speciﬁed label in a batch ﬁle  Permits conditional execution of a command  Displays a message and halts processing until a key is pressed  Enables you to insert comments into a batch ﬁle that describe the purpose of an operation  Shifts the command-line parameters one parameter to the left  @  CALL  CHOICE  ECHO  GOTO  IF  PAUSE  REM  SHIFT  You can use any of the commands listed in Table 16.1 in a batch ﬁle; you can use some of them at the DOS system level, as well. For example, you can type ECHO with or without an argument at the DOS prompt. DOS displays the string you type after ECHO or, if you provide   398  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  no argument, tells you whether echo is on or off. If you type PAUSE at the DOS prompt, DOS displays the following message and waits for a keystroke: Press any key to continue  Although these two commands are not very useful at the DOS prompt, the FOR..IN..DO command structure can be quite useful at the operating-system level to carry out repetitive commands  see “Using FOR..IN..DO” later in this chapter .  The following sections explain the batch commands and their uses.  Displaying Messages and Inserting Comments  You already have had an introduction to the ECHO command earlier in this chapter. This command does two things: ECHO ON and ECHO OFF turn on and off the display of lines from batch ﬁles as commands are executed, and ECHO also displays messages.  ECHO can display a message up to 122 characters long  the 127-character DOS command- line limit, minus the length of the ECHO command and an additional space .  You can use REM  which stands for remark  in a batch ﬁle to remind you what the batch ﬁle does. When you review a batch ﬁle some time after you create it, you might no longer remember why you used certain commands or why you constructed the batch ﬁle in a par- ticular way. Leave reminders in your batch ﬁle by using REM statements, which don’t appear onscreen when echo is off. The REM comments make the batch ﬁle self-documenting, a fea- ture that you and other users will appreciate later.  The REM function is an important feature to use when you’re writing batch ﬁles. It is a good idea to include remarks with every section in a batch ﬁle explaining what the sec- tion is doing, such as copying a ﬁle from one location to another. These remarks help explain how the batch ﬁle works if others need to modify it.  Another important use of the REM function is to comment out a line in a batch ﬁle with- out actually deleting it. This can prove very useful during troubleshooting problems in a batch ﬁle.  If you want the batch ﬁle to display particular messages, use ECHO. Messages set with ECHO appear onscreen whether or not you set ECHO OFF. To insert a blank line between messages, type a period  but no space  after the ECHO command, as follows: ECHO.  Branching with GOTO  When you run a batch ﬁle, DOS normally processes commands one line at a time, from the beginning of the batch ﬁle to the end. When you use the GOTO command, however, you can change the order in which DOS executes batch commands by instructing DOS to branch to a speciﬁc line in the ﬁle.   Using Batch File Commands  399  The syntax of GOTO is as follows: GOTO label  The GOTO command uses label to specify the place in the ﬁle to which DOS should branch. A batch ﬁle label is a separate line that is not a command, per se. A label consists of a colon followed by one to eight characters. The label name can be longer than eight characters, but DOS reads only the ﬁrst eight characters.  When DOS encounters a GOTO command in the batch ﬁle, it starts at the beginning of the batch ﬁle and searches for a label matching the one speciﬁed by GOTO. DOS then branches to the batch ﬁle line following the label.  Consider the following batch ﬁle, LOOP.BAT. This ﬁle is similar to the TEST.BAT batch ﬁle you created previously, with the addition of the GOTO and PAUSE commands: @ECHO OFF :LOOP  Part IV Ch 16  @ECHO Hello, %1 PAUSE  GOTO LOOP  To test the batch ﬁle, type the following and press Enter: LOOP DAVID  The screen shows the following message: Hello, DAVID Press any key to continue_  The batch ﬁle begins by echoing Hello, DAVID and then waits for you to press a key. After you press a key, DOS again displays the following message: Hello, DAVID Press any key to continue_  When you press a key again, DOS executes the GOTO LOOP command, causing execution of the batch ﬁle to return to the line labeled :LOOP at the beginning of the ﬁle. DOS again dis- plays the message and pauses.  This batch ﬁle is an example of what programmers call an inﬁnite loop. The program never stops on its own. To abort the batch ﬁle, you must press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break.  This simple example illustrates the operation of GOTO. You seldom will create inﬁnite loops on purpose, but you should be able to use the GOTO command to control the order in which DOS executes batch ﬁle commands.  Using the IF Command  The IF command is a “test-and-do” command. When a given condition is true, the IF com- mand executes a stated action. When the given condition is false, IF skips the action. If you are familiar with programming languages, such as BASIC, you should recognize the DOS IF command.   400  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  The IF command tests the following three conditions:    The ERRORLEVEL of a program   Whether a string is equal to another string   Whether a ﬁle exists  The following sections explain these tests.  Using IF to Test ERRORLEVEL The ﬁrst condition that IF can test is ERRORLEVEL. The proper syntax for testing the ERROR- LEVEL is as follows: IF NOT ERRORLEVEL number command  ERRORLEVEL is a code left by a program when it ﬁnishes executing. A better name for this condition might be “exit level.” This form of the IF command determines whether the value of ERRORLEVEL is greater than or equal to a number speciﬁed in the number parameter. Conversely, by adding the optional word NOT, you can determine whether the value of ERRORLEVEL is not greater than or equal to the value of the number parameter. If the speciﬁed condition is true, DOS executes the command speciﬁed in the command parameter. Otherwise, DOS skips to the next line in the batch ﬁle without executing the command.  The only DOS commands that leave an ERRORLEVEL  exit  code are BACKUP, DISKCOMP, DISKCOPY, FORMAT, GRAFTABL, KEYB, REPLACE, RESTORE, and XCOPY. Many other programs gener- ate exit codes, however.  An exit code of zero  0  usually indicates that the command was successful. Any number greater than 0 usually indicates that something went wrong when the program executed. The following exit codes, for example, are generated by the DISKCOPY command:  Code  0  1  2  3  4  Meaning The operation was successful. A read write error that did not terminate the disk-copy operation occurred. The user pressed Ctrl+C. A “fatal” read write error occurred and terminated the copy procedure before it was completed. An initialization error occurred.  An IF command in a batch ﬁle enables you to test for the exit code generated by a DOS command or program to determine whether the command or program worked properly.  When you use ERRORLEVEL to test exit codes, DOS tests whether the code is equal to or greater than the speciﬁed number. If the exit code is equal to or greater than the number, DOS executes the command parameter. If the code does not meet the condition, DOS skips   Using Batch File Commands  401  the command parameter and executes the next command in the batch ﬁle. You can think of this condition as a BASIC-like statement, as follows: IF exit code >= number THEN do command  The IF ERRORLEVEL command is most useful with the CHOICE command  see “Pausing for Input in a Batch File” later in this chapter . When your batch ﬁle uses this utility, the ﬁle can pause for keyboard input. The utility puts a value in ERRORLEVEL related to the key pressed. You then can make your batch ﬁle branch or perform some other task based on the key pressed. A batch ﬁle otherwise does not accept keyboard input except when the input is provided on a batch-ﬁle command line.  Suppose that you want to create a batch ﬁle named DCOPY.BAT that makes disk copies in your drive A, using the DISKCOPY command and the verify switch. If the disk-copy procedure ter- minates before completion, you want the batch ﬁle to inform you of the cause.  ➔ For more information about making copies of disks, see “Copying Entire Disks with DISKCOPY,” p. 210.  Part IV Ch 16  Create a batch ﬁle named DCOPY.BAT that contains the following lines: @ECHO OFF DISKCOPY A: A:  V IF ERRORLEVEL 4 GOTO INIT_ERR IF ERRORLEVEL 3 GOTO FATL_ERR IF ERRORLEVEL 2 GOTO CTRL+C IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO NON_FATL ECHO DISKCOPY successful and verified! GOTO END :INIT_ERR  ECHO Initialization error! GOTO END  ECHO Fatal error! DISKCOPY stopped! GOTO END  ECHO Someone pressed Ctrl+C! GOTO END  :FATL_ERR  :CTRL+C  :NON-FATL  :END  ECHO A non-fatal error occurred. Check data!  To run this batch ﬁle, type DCOPY at the command line and then press Enter. DOS displays the following message: Insert SOURCE diskette in drive A: Press any key to continue_  When you press a key, DOS begins the disk-copy procedure. After the DISKCOPY command in the batch ﬁle executes, the batch ﬁle runs through a series of IF ERRORLEVEL tests. Based on what you already know, these tests are in descending order  4 to 1  because ERRORLEVEL considers any number equal to or greater than the speciﬁed number to be a match. Thus, if you were to check for 1 ﬁrst, 4 would also be a match, and you would never get to the proper test.   402  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  First, the batch ﬁle tests for an initialization error  exit code = 4 . If the exit code equals or is greater than 4, DOS skips to the line labeled :INIT_ERR. If the exit code is 3, execution of the batch ﬁle skips to the :FATL_ERR label. The batch ﬁle branches to the :CTRL_C label if an exit code of 2 is detected, and to the :NON_FATL label when the exit code is 1.  Finally, if no errors are detected by the series of IF ERRORLEVEL commands, the batch ﬁle displays the following message: DISKCOPY successful and verified!  Using IF to Compare Strings The second use for the IF command is to test whether string 1 equals string 2. The syntax of the batch command is as follows: IF NOT string1==string2 command  This form of the IF command determines whether the ﬁrst character string, string1, is the same group of characters as string2. Usually, one string is a replaceable parameter. If the two strings are identical, this condition is true and DOS executes the command speciﬁed in the command parameter. Otherwise, DOS skips to the next line in the batch ﬁle without executing the command. By adding NOT to the IF command, you can test for the condition when the two strings are not the same.  Assume that you want to create a batch ﬁle named DAYBACK.BAT that backs up your hard disk each day of the week. On Fridays, you want the batch ﬁle to perform a complete backup. On Mondays through Thursdays, you want the batch ﬁle to perform an incremental backup. Use the DOS Editor or another text editor to create the following batch ﬁle: @ECHO OFF CLS IF “%1”==”” GOTO TRY_AGAIN IF %1==FRI GOTO FULL IF %1==MON GOTO ADD IF %1==TUE GOTO ADD IF %1==WED GOTO ADD IF %1==THU GOTO ADD :TRY_AGAIN  ECHO Try again! Type DAYBACK and day of week  MON-FRI . GOTO END  :FULL  :ADD  :END  ECHO Insert first disk of backup set. PAUSE C: CD \ BACKUP C: A:  S GOTO END  ECHO Insert last disk of backup set. PAUSE C: CD \ BACKUP C: A:  S M A   Using Batch File Commands  403  To run this batch ﬁle, type DAYBACK, followed by the three-letter abbreviation for the day of the week  MON, TUE, WED, THU, or FRI , and then press Enter.  The ﬁrst IF command in DAYBACK.BAT checks to make sure that you have typed the day of the week. If you don’t provide enough parameters with the IF command, DOS replaces the replaceable parameter with a null value.  In batch ﬁles, null values must be enclosed in quo- tation marks to prevent a syntax error.   The remaining IF commands determine whether you typed FRI or another day of the week. If you type FRI, the batch ﬁle branches to the :FULL label and performs a full backup. If you typed MON through THU, the ﬁle jumps to the :ADD label and performs an additive incremental backup. If you typed anything else, the batch ﬁle instructs you to try again.  Part IV Ch 16  The :END label often is used to mark the end of the batch ﬁle. In the preceding batch ﬁle, execution branches to the :END label after a full backup, after an incremental backup, or after you are instructed to try again. When you use this technique, DOS exe- cutes only a portion of the batch ﬁle each time you run it, skipping the portions of the batch ﬁle that don’t apply. Because the :END label is the last line in the batch ﬁle, the batch ﬁle ends at that point.  In the DAYBACK.BAT example, the replaceable parameter in the ﬁrst IF command is enclosed in quotation marks because programmers commonly use quotation marks to delimit charac- ter strings. Actually, a comparison with any letter, number, or symbol can do the job. One common procedure is to use a single period instead of quotation marks, as shown in the fol- lowing example: IF %1. == . GOTO TRY_AGAIN  If you don’t enter a parameter for %1, DOS interprets the line as follows: IF . == . GOTO TRY_AGAIN  Use the syntax that is easiest for you to remember and understand.  If %1 equals nothing, DOS branches to the line following the label TRY_AGAIN and displays a message. If %1 equals something other than nothing, DOS does not branch to TRY_AGAIN; instead, it executes the second IF command in the batch ﬁle, which tests whether you typed DAYBACK FRI, and so on. Notice that GOTO statements are used to jump around the parts of the batch ﬁle that DOS should not execute.  When you use the IF command, DOS compares strings literally. Uppercase characters are different from lowercase characters. For example, say you run DAYBACK by typing this com- mand: DAYBACK Fri  DOS compares Fri with the uppercase FRI and decides that the two strings are not the same. The IF test fails, and DOS does not perform the backup operation.   404  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  Using IF to Look for Files The third type of IF command tests whether a given ﬁle is on disk. The syntax for this form of the IF command is as follows: IF NOT EXIST filename command  This form of the IF command determines whether the ﬁle speciﬁed in the filename parame- ter exists on your computer’s disk  or doesn’t exist, if you add NOT . If the ﬁle does exist, the IF command executes the command speciﬁed in the command parameter.  You can use IF EXIST when you start a word processing program. Perhaps you use a ﬁle called TEMP.TXT to store temporary ﬁles or write blocks that are to be read into other docu- ments. You can use IF EXIST to test for the existence of the ﬁle and erase the ﬁle if it does exist.  Your batch ﬁle, called WORD.BAT, would look like the following example: @ECHO OFF CLS CD \DOCUMENT IF EXIST TEMP.TXT DEL TEMP.TXT CD WORDS WP CD \  This batch ﬁle turns off ECHO and clears the screen. The current directory changes to  \DOCUMENT—the directory where you store your word processing documents.  Next, the IF command tests for the existence of TEMP.TXT. If the ﬁle does exist, DOS deletes the ﬁle. Finally, DOS starts your word processing program from the \WORDS subdirectory.  Notice the last line of the batch ﬁle: CD \. When your word processing program starts, the batch ﬁle is suspended temporarily. After you quit your word processing program, the batch ﬁle regains control. The batch ﬁle then executes its last line, CD \, which changes back to the root directory. The batch ﬁle ends.  Pausing for Input in a Batch File  Before DOS 6.0, the only way to effect the execution of a batch ﬁle after the ﬁle started was to press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break. These key combinations enabled you to cancel a single com- mand or end the entire operation. Starting with DOS 6.0, you are provided a means of tem- porarily halting the execution of a batch ﬁle and accepting limited user input. You can use this feature to decide whether to process certain commands, to branch to a different part  of a batch ﬁle, or even to present a menu and accept any of a series of choices.  To employ this capability, you use the CHOICE command. The command’s syntax is as  follows: CHOICE  C:choices  N  S  T:c,nn message   Pausing for Input in a Batch File  405  Following are explanations of the components of this command:     C:choices lists the keys that can be pressed. If you don’t specify choices, the default is YN.    N prevents the display of acceptable keys at the end of the prompt.    S instructs CHOICE to pay attention to the case of the key pressed; this feature enables  you to use Y and y for different choices.     T:c,nn causes CHOICE to act as though you pressed the key represented by c if you  don’t make a choice within nn seconds.    message is the optional prompt to display.  You respond to the key pressed by using a series of IF ERRORLEVEL commands. By default, the choices are Y and N. Y has the ERRORLEVEL code 2, and N has the ERRORLEVEL code 1.  Part IV Ch 16  Making a Two-Way Choice  If you don’t specify which keys should be pressed, CHOICE assumes Y and N, and adds [Y,N]? to the end of whatever message you choose to include. This feature is extremely useful if you want to decide whether to load a certain program when your computer starts. For example, you might type the following commands near the end of your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle: CHOICE Back up hard disk IF ERRORLEVEL 2 MSBACKUP  When the AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle reaches the ﬁrst line, DOS displays the following message: Back up hard disk[Y,N]?  If you have not yet backed up your hard disk today, you type Y, which generates the  ERRORLEVEL code 2. DOS then executes the MSBACKUP program. If you have backed up your hard disk, type N. You need not test for this code, however, because it’s the only other alter- native. DOS then executes any commands following these lines in AUTOEXEC.BAT, but MSBACKUP doesn’t run.  Creating a Simple Menu  Because you can specify any keys as choices, you can use CHOICE to create a simple menu, using the  C:choices parameter to specify the keys to be pressed. You might use a command such as the following: CHOICE  c:swd Load Spreadsheet, Word Processor, or Database Manager  DOS displays the following message: Load Spreadsheet, Word Processor, or Database Manager[S,W,D]?  The ERRORLEVEL codes for the speciﬁed keys read from left to right. Thus, pressing D gener- ates a code 3; pressing W, a code 2; and pressing S, a code 1. These exit codes are then processed by batch ﬁle lines such as the following: IF ERRORLEVEL 3 DB IF ERRORLEVEL 2 WP IF ERRORLEVEL 1 SS   406  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  This assumes that your database program is named DB, your word processor is named  WP, and your spreadsheet is named SS. There is a problem with this, however. The IF ERRORLEVEL command automatically assumes that all numbers higher than the one speciﬁed also are true. If you type D, for example, DOS loads your word processing program as soon as you exit from your database manager and your spreadsheet program as soon as you exit from your word processing program.  You can deal with this situation in either of two ways. One way is to add a second command that changes the ﬂow of execution. Your ﬁle would have to resemble the following example: CHOICE  C:swd Load Spreadsheet, Word Processor, or Database Manager IF ERRORLEVEL 3 DB IF ERRORLEVEL 3 GOTO END IF ERRORLEVEL 2 WP IF ERRORLEVEL 2 GOTO END IF ERRORLEVEL 1 SS :END  The second way to deal with the limitation of the ERRORLEVEL directive is to have each test execute a batch ﬁle instead of a program.  After you pass control to a second batch ﬁle, DOS does not return to the original ﬁle unless you use CALL or COMMAND  C.  For this command to work properly, the batch ﬁles must appear either in the current directory or in a directory in the path that precedes the directories containing the programs.  Always give a user a way to get out of a command without choosing any of the proffered alternatives. The user, of course, can break out of the CHOICE command by pressing Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break. But you also can include a third alternative, such as Quit, as shown in the following example: CHOICE  C:YNQ Back up hard disk IF ERRORLEVEL 3  GOTO END IF ERRORLEVEL 2  GOTO END IF ERRORLEVEL 1  MSBACKUP other commands :END  Creating a Simple Display Menu  You can use the other switches provided with CHOICE to create a display menu. You create text to explain the choices and suppress the display of characters at the end of the optional message. You might create a batch ﬁle called MENU.BAT and type the following commands: @ECHO OFF CLS ECHO; ECHO; ECHO Press S to load Spreadsheet ECHO Press W to load Word Processor ECHO Press D to load Database Manager ECHO Press Q to quit ECHO; CHOICE  C:SWDQ  N  T:Q,10 Your choice? IF ERRORLEVEL 4 GOTO END IF ERRORLEVEL 3 GOTO DB   Using FOR..IN..DO  407  Part IV Ch 16  IF ERRORLEVEL 2 GOTO WP  ECHO Loading spreadsheet program_ SS GOTO END  :WP  :DB  :END  ECHO Loading word processing program_ WP GOTO END  ECHO Loading database management program_ DB  Notice that no ERRORLEVEL choice is available for times the user presses S  the ERRORLEVEL would be 1  because there is no need to branch in this case. Instead, execution of the batch ﬁle falls through to the ﬁrst line after the last ERRORLEVEL statement, which is the command for the spreadsheet section.  When you type the MENU command, DOS clears the screen and displays the following message: Press S to load Spreadsheet Press W to load Word Processor Press D to load Database Manager Press Q to quit Your choice?  If no key is pressed within 10 seconds, the CHOICE command issues a Q, and the DOS prompt returns.  You can construct very elaborate menus by using the ASCII box-drawing characters, ANSI Escape sequences  to establish colors , and the CHOICE command.  ➔ For a discussion of the uses of ANSI.SYS, see Chapter 17, “Understanding ANSI.SYS,” p. 415.  Using FOR..IN..DO  FOR..IN..DO is an unusual and extremely powerful batch command. The command’s syntax is as follows: FOR %%variable IN  set  DO command  variable is a one-letter name that takes on the value of each item in set. You can use this command from the DOS prompt as well as within a batch ﬁle. When you use the command at the DOS prompt, however, use only one percent sign  %  instead of two  %%  in front of variable. You must use two percent signs in a batch ﬁle so that DOS does not confuse variable with a replaceable parameter.  The set parameter is the list of items, commands, or disk ﬁles whose value you want vari- able to take. You can use wildcard ﬁlenames with this parameter. You also can use drive names and paths with any ﬁlenames you specify. If you have more than one item in the set, use a space or comma between the names.  The command parameter is any valid DOS command that you want to perform for each item in set.   408  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  Using a FOR..IN..DO Batch File  An interesting example of the use of FOR..IN..DO is a batch ﬁle that compares ﬁlenames found on a disk in drive A with the ﬁlenames found on another disk and then produces a list of the ﬁles on both disks. Create the batch ﬁle CHECKIT.BAT, entering the following lines: @ECHO OFF CLS IF “%1”==”” GOTO END FOR %%a IN  B: C: D: E: b: c: d: e:  DO IF “%%a”==”%1” GOTO COMPARE ECHO Syntax error: You must specify a disk to compare. ECHO Be sure to leave a space before directory. GOTO END :COMPARE  %1 IF “%2”==”” GOTO SKIP CD %2  :SKIP  :END  ECHO The following files are on both disks: FOR %%a IN  *.*  DO IF EXIST A:%%a ECHO %%a  Insert into drive A the disk that you want to compare and then use the following syntax: CHECKIT drive directory  drive is the drive that contains the other disk that you want to compare, and directory is the directory that you want to compare. This batch ﬁle substitutes the drive you specify for %1 in the batch ﬁle commands and substitutes any directory you specify for %2. The direc- tory is optional; if you specify a drive and directory, separate their names with a space. Otherwise, the batch ﬁle treats the drive and directory as one replaceable parameter  %1 . If you don’t specify a directory name, DOS compares the current directory of the drive with the current directory of the disk in drive A.  Suppose that you want to compare the list of ﬁles in drive A with the list of ﬁles in the \GAMES directory in drive B. Type the following command at the command line: CHECKIT B: \GAMES  The batch ﬁle determines which ﬁles in the \GAMES directory of the disk in drive B also are on the current directory of the disk in drive A.  When the CHECKIT batch ﬁle is called, DOS ﬁrst determines whether %1 is empty.  %1 is empty if you typed no drive letter or directory after CHECKIT in the command line.  If %1 is empty, the batch ﬁle displays an error message, branches to the end of the ﬁle, and quits without performing a comparison.  If you specify a disk drive, DOS goes to the third line of the batch ﬁle and determines whether the drive letter is a valid drive letter. In this batch ﬁle, valid drive letters are B, C, D, E, b, c, d, and e. If no valid drive letter is found, or if you don’t include a colon  :  and space after the drive letter, the batch ﬁle displays a message and branches to the end of the batch ﬁle.  If you speciﬁed a valid drive, CHECKIT branches to the :COMPARE section of the program. When executing the ﬁrst line in this section, DOS logs on to the drive you speciﬁed in the   Moving Parameters with SHIFT  409  command line  the drive designation replaces %1 in the batch ﬁle . The batch ﬁle determines whether you included a directory parameter; if you did include this parameter, DOS changes to that directory.  Finally, the batch ﬁle displays a message and then looks at all the ﬁlenames in the current directory to see whether a ﬁle with the same name exists in drive A. For every match found, the batch ﬁle lists the ﬁlename.  Using FOR..IN..DO at the DOS Prompt  You might ﬁnd that you want to issue commands such as the ones in CHECKIT at the DOS prompt. Instead of using the batch ﬁle for the preceding example, you can change subdirec- tories manually and then type the FOR..IN..DO line  the line that does all the work in the batch ﬁle  at the DOS prompt. If you do use FOR..IN..DO outside a batch ﬁle, DOS requires that you enter only one percent sign.  Part IV Ch 16  Using FOR..IN..DO with Other Commands  FOR..IN..DO works as well with commands as with ﬁlenames. Instead of naming a set of ﬁles, you can name a series of commands that you want DOS to carry out. Consider the follow- ing example: FOR %%a IN  COPY DEL  DO %%a C:*.*  In a batch ﬁle, this line ﬁrst copies all the ﬁles on drive C to the current directory and then erases the ﬁles from drive C. Instead of specifying the drive and ﬁle, you can use a replace- able parameter in the line, as follows: FOR %%a IN  COPY DEL  DO %%a %1  To use this batch ﬁle, you ﬁrst must change to the destination directory  for example, D:\BAK . When you invoke this version of the batch ﬁle, you type the names of the ﬁles that you want to copy and remove. If you name the batch ﬁle MOVER.BAT, you can type the fol- lowing command to invoke the ﬁle: MOVER C:\WP  MOVER.BAT copies all the ﬁles in the subdirectory C:\WP to D:\BAK and then erases the ﬁles in C:\WP. This ﬁle works much like the C&E.BAT ﬁle you created earlier in this chapter.  Moving Parameters with SHIFT  The SHIFT command moves the parameters in the command line that invoked the batch ﬁle; each parameter moves one parameter to the left. SHIFT tricks DOS into accepting more than 9 replaceable parameters  10 if you include the batch ﬁlename, which is %0 . The diagram of SHIFT is as follows: %0  ←%1  ←%2  ←%3  ←%4  ←%5... ↓ bit bucket   410  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  In this diagram, parameter 0 is dropped. The old parameter 1 becomes parameter 0. The old parameter 2 becomes parameter 1; parameter 3 becomes 2; parameter 4 becomes 3; and so on. A command-line parameter that previously was 10th in line and not assigned a param- eter number now becomes parameter 9.  The following batch ﬁle, SHIFTIT.BAT, is a simple example of the use of the SHIFT command: @ECHO OFF CLS :START ECHO %0 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 SHIFT PAUSE IF NOT “%0”==”” GOTO START  Suppose that you type the following text: SHIFTIT A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  The screen shows the following message: SHIFTIT A B C D E F G H I Press any key to continue_  Notice that the batch ﬁlename is displayed because %0 holds the name of the batch ﬁle. Press a key to continue; DOS now displays the following message: A B C D E F G H I J Press any key to continue_  In this case, the ﬁlename has been dropped into the bit bucket. %0 now equals A. All the parameters have shifted one to the left. Each time you press a key to continue, SHIFT contin- ues moving down the list of parameters you typed. When the leftmost parameter  %0  is empty, the batch ﬁle ends.  SHIFT has many uses. You can use it to build a new version of the C&E.BAT ﬁle you created earlier in this chapter. The following modiﬁed version of the copy-and-erase batch ﬁle, called MOVE.BAT, shows a use for SHIFT: @ECHO OFF CLS :LOOP COPY %1  V ERASE %1 SHIFT IF NOT “%1” == “” GOTO LOOP  This batch ﬁle copies and erases the speciﬁed ﬁle or ﬁles. The batch ﬁle assumes nothing about the ﬁles to be copied; you can specify a disk drive, path, and ﬁlename. The batch ﬁle copies the ﬁles to the current directory and then erases the ﬁles from the original disk or directory.  The last two lines shift the parameters to the left, determine whether any parameters remain, and then repeat the operation if necessary.   Running Batch Files from Other Batch Files  411  Part IV Ch 16  Running Batch Files from Other Batch Files  On some occasions, you might want to run a batch ﬁle from another batch ﬁle. Running batch ﬁles from within batch ﬁles is particularly useful when you want to create a menu batch ﬁle that can start several different programs.  The following sections discuss three ways to run batch ﬁles from other batch ﬁles. One method is a one-way transfer of control. The other two methods involve running a second batch ﬁle and returning control to the ﬁrst batch ﬁle. These techniques are useful if you want to build menus with batch ﬁles or use one batch ﬁle to set up and start another batch ﬁle.  Shifting Control Permanently to Another Batch File  The ﬁrst method of calling a second batch ﬁle is simple: Include the root name of the sec- ond batch ﬁle as a line in the ﬁrst batch ﬁle. The ﬁrst batch ﬁle runs the second batch ﬁle as though you had typed the second batch ﬁle’s root name at the DOS prompt.  To run BATCH2.BAT, for example, include in BATCH1.BAT the following line: BATCH2  DOS loads and executes BATCH2.BAT. Control passes in only one direction: from the ﬁrst batch ﬁle to the second. When BATCH2.BAT ﬁnishes executing, DOS displays the system prompt. Control goes to the second ﬁle but doesn’t come back to the ﬁrst ﬁle.  Calling a Batch File and Returning Using CALL  After your batch ﬁle is debugged, you can use the CALL statement to run a batch ﬁle and then return to the original one. The syntax of the CALL command is as follows: CALL filename parameters  filename is the root name of the batch ﬁle. When you type the CALL command, you can specify any parameters that you want to pass to the batch ﬁle you are calling. You can place the CALL command anywhere in the ﬁrst batch ﬁle.  When DOS executes a CALL command, DOS temporarily shifts execution to the called batch ﬁle. As soon as the called batch ﬁle is completed, DOS returns to the ﬁrst batch ﬁle and continues execution with the line immediately following the CALL command.  The following three batch ﬁles demonstrate how CALL works:  BATCH1.BAT @ECHO OFF CLS REM This file does the setup work for REM demonstrating the CALL command. ECHO This is the STARTUP batch file ECHO The command parameters are %%0-%0 %%1-%1 CALL batch2 second ECHO MEM from %0 MEM ECHO Done!   412  Chapter 16 Understanding Batch Files  BATCH2.BAT  ECHO This is the SECOND batch file ECHO The command parameters are %%0-%0 %%1-%1 CALL batch3 third ECHO MEM from %0 MEM  BATCH3.BAT   ECHO This is the THIRD batch file  ECHO The command parameters are %%0-%0 %%1-%1 ECHO MEM from %0 MEM  The ﬁrst line of BATCH1.BAT sets ECHO OFF. The second line clears the screen. The next two lines in BATCH1 are remarks intended only to document the purpose of the batch ﬁle.  The two ECHO lines are similar for all three batch ﬁles. The ﬁrst of the two lines identiﬁes the batch ﬁle being used. The second ECHO line shows the %0 parameter  the name by which  the batch ﬁle was invoked  and the ﬁrst parameter  the ﬁrst argument  for the batch ﬁle. Notice that to display the strings %0 and %1, you must use two percent signs  %%0 and %%1 .  If you use a single percent sign, DOS interprets the string as a replaceable parameter and does not display the actual percent symbol.  Each CALL statement in the ﬁrst and second batch ﬁles invokes another batch ﬁle. BATCH1.BAT calls BATCH2.BAT, and BATCH2.BAT in turn calls BATCH3.BAT. In each case, a  single argument passes to the batch ﬁle being called: second to BATCH2.BAT and third to BATCH3.BAT. Each batch ﬁle then displays its name  by using the %0 variable  and runs MEM. When DOS reaches the end of each called batch ﬁle, DOS returns to the calling batch ﬁle.  Check the printout or screen display for the largest executable program size provided by the MEM command  in other words, the largest block of memory available for use by an exe- cutable program . This number grows larger after each batch ﬁle is executed and removed from memory.  Each time you use the CALL command, DOS temporarily uses 80 bytes of RAM until the called batch ﬁle ﬁnishes running. Because DOS uses that much memory for each nested CALL command, you can run out of memory.  A nested CALL command is a CALL command from a called batch ﬁle.  Not many people nest CALL commands deeply in batch ﬁles. The accumulated memory-usage problem does not occur when a single batch ﬁle calls multiple other batch ﬁles. In that case, you can use the CALL command as many times as you want and use only the same 80 bytes of RAM for each call.  Using COMMAND.COM to Execute a Batch File  In all versions of DOS, you can call a second batch ﬁle from the ﬁrst, execute the second batch ﬁle, and return to the ﬁrst batch ﬁle. In DOS 3.0 through 3.2, you use COMMAND  C. In DOS 3.3 and later versions, you use the CALL command, discussed in the following section.  ➔ For more information on COMMAND  C, see “Loading a Secondary Command Processor,” p. 288.   Running Batch Files from Other Batch Files  413  Although it might appear at ﬁrst glance that you no longer need to use the COMMAND.COM method of running a batch ﬁle, beginning with DOS 6.2 there is a compelling new reason. That is, with DOS 6.2, you can use COMMAND.COM’s  Y switch, in conjunction with  C, to  single-step through a batch ﬁle. Suppose you execute the following command line: COMMAND  Y  C NEW.BAT  When you do so, DOS loads a copy of the command processor and executes NEW.BAT. As it executes, each line in the batch ﬁle is displayed, and you are asked whether you want to exe- cute it. You use this same process when you interactively execute the AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle, as described in Chapter 2, “Starting DOS.”  This interactive execution capability is a great debugging tool for complex batch ﬁles. When the entire batch ﬁle is through running, DOS exits the command processor and returns to the original batch ﬁle.  Part IV Ch 16    CHAPTER  17  Understanding ANSI.SYS In this chapter  What Is ANSI.SYS? 416  Installing ANSI.SYS 416  Using ANSI.SYS 416  Controlling Your Screen with ANSI.SYS 419  Customizing Your Keyboard with ANSI.SYS 423  ANSI Control Codes 425   416  Chapter 17 Understanding ANSI.SYS  What Is ANSI.SYS?  The term ANSI refers to the American National Standards Institute. ANSI is one of several sets of computer standards established by the institute to specify the codes that computer manufacturers can use to control video displays and keyboard mapping.  ANSI.SYS is a device driver, which means that it gives DOS additional control of the screen and keyboard devices beyond the control features built into the operating system. You use ANSI.SYS to enhance the functions of your video screen and keyboard. With ANSI.SYS, you can set screen colors, use graphics, and specify other video attributes. You can provide that personal touch to your DOS prompt. You even can change the assignments of keys on your keyboard.  The ANSI.SYS file supplied with MS-DOS contains a subset of the ANSI standards. Third- party suppliers of other ANSI.SYS files might include more features in their versions of this file, but those features are not necessary for most users.  Installing ANSI.SYS  The only way you can install the ANSI.SYS driver is to include it in your CONFIG.SYS file. The format of the line must be one of the following: DEVICE = C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS  X  K  R  DEVICEHIGH = C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS  X  K  R  The  X switch enables you to remap extended keys if you are using a 101-key keyboard. The  K switch treats 101-key keyboards as if they were 84-key keyboards, ignoring extended keys. The  R switch slows screen scrolling for improved readability.  The  X and  K switches are mutually exclusive because you cannot define a 101-key and 84-key keyboard at the same time.  When you install MS-DOS on your computer, DOS places the ANSI.SYS file in the \DOS subdirectory. If ANSI.SYS is located in the root directory of your boot drive, you don’t have to include its drive and directory name in the command line. If you placed the ANSI.SYS file in another directory or on another drive, however, be sure that you specify the exact loca- tion of ANSI.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS statement.  In the following sections, you will learn how to use the ANSI.SYS driver and take advantage of its features.  Using ANSI.SYS  You must place the ANSI.SYS command in the CONFIG.SYS file to load the driver and reboot the system so that the new configuration takes effect, you must issue commands that tell DOS to use the ANSI features.   Using ANSI.SYS  417  Because some software is written to use ANSI codes, one or more of your programs might require that ANSI.SYS be loaded. The installation procedure for this type of software notifies you of this requirement.  The program might even install the command in the CONFIG.SYS file for you.   You can activate ANSI.SYS features also by issuing the ANSI commands yourself. However, you cannot simply type the commands at the DOS prompt; you must enter an Escape sequence. All ANSI.SYS sequences begin with the Escape character  ASCII value 27 , fol- lowed by a left bracket  [ . If you type this sequence at the prompt, DOS understands the Escape character to be a command to cancel the current operation; DOS cancels the opera- tion, displays a backslash  \ , and moves the cursor down to the next line.  If ANSI.SYS codes are not included in a program, you can send these codes to DOS in three ways: by executing a batch file, by typing a text file  that is, by using the DOS TYPE com- mand , or by including the codes in a PROMPT command. When you embed ANSI codes in Escape sequences, the ANSI.SYS device driver intercepts the codes and executes the appro- priate commands, ignoring any characters that are not preceded by the proper codes.  You can create a text file or batch file or set up your PROMPT format in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file by using the MS-DOS editor  EDIT  or another text editor. Whatever utility you use must be capable of entering the Escape character, which is beyond the capability of many word pro- cessing programs and older text editors.  To enter the Escape character while using EDIT, hold down the Ctrl key, press P, and then press Esc.  ➔ For information on using EDIT, see Chapter 15, “Using the DOS Editor,” p. 361.  Some text editors display the Escape character as ^[. Because the ANSI code sequence requires a left bracket after the Escape character, the ANSI sequence might appear as ^[[.  Part IV Ch 17  Issuing ANSI.SYS Codes in Batch Files  The key to using ANSI.SYS is to have the Escape sequences sent to the display screen. This procedure is the only way to ensure that the device driver properly intercepts and executes the commands. Batch files send these sequences to the screen through the ECHO command, which tells DOS to display all commands on the screen.  ➔ For more information on batch files, see Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files,” p. 389.  By default, ECHO is set ON unless you explicitly issue an ECHO OFF command. If you do use ECHO OFF, any ANSI code line you enter thereafter must begin with the ECHO command.  Suppose that you want to use a batch file to set up formatting for a double-density disk  360KB  in a 5 1 4-inch high-density  1.2MB  drive. You use EDIT to create the batch file   418  Chapter 17 Understanding ANSI.SYS  containing the instruction for the special effect, such as changing the color of the screen. Entering the following batch file and giving it the name NEWDISK.BAT do the trick: @ECHO OFF ECHO  [37;41m ECHO THIS FUNCTION FORMATS DOUBLE DENSITY DISKETTES  360K  IN DRIVE A: FORMAT A:  F:360 ECHO  [37;40m  The first line in the batch file tells DOS not to display any of the commands in the batch file unless specifically instructed to do so through the ECHO command. The leading character  @  instructs DOS not to display the ECHO OFF command.  The second line is an ANSI.SYS code sequence that sets the color of the screen  red, with white characters . Replace   with the actual Escape code  ASCII value 27 . The ANSI code 37 produces a white foreground; 41 is the ANSI code for a red background. The char- acter m indicates that screen attribute codes are being issued. The last line of the batch file resets the screen to white on black—the default setting.  Make sure that you use the lower- case character m in the ANSI.SYS Escape sequences.   If you have a monochrome monitor, you can substitute 7m for 37;41m in the second line of the batch file. The code 7 tells ANSI.SYS to set reverse video. If you use 7m instead of 37;41m, substitute 0m for 37;40m in the last line to set the screen back to normal.  To see why you must use the ECHO command in the ANSI Escape sequence, remove the ECHO command from the last line of the batch file, and then run the file again. The ECHO com- mand is required to pass the codes to the display. If it is not available, DOS informs you that it received a bad command or filename, and the screen color does not change to normal.  Issuing ANSI.SYS Codes in Text Files  Issuing ANSI codes in text files is similar to using the codes in batch files, except that you do not use an ECHO command in a text file. Also, for the commands to take effect, you must use the TYPE command to pass the codes to the display for DOS to execute. To look at a sample text file, create a SCREEN.TXT file that contains the following line:  [37;41m  After you create and save this file, you can change the screen to red with white characters by entering the following command at the DOS prompt: TYPE SCREEN.TXT  ANSI.SYS intercepts the characters of the file when being sent to the screen with the TYPE command. The Escape sequence, followed by the bracket, causes the device driver to exe- cute the ANSI commands instead of passing the characters through to DOS. Your screen is now red with white characters.   Controlling Your Screen with ANSI.SYS  419  Part IV Ch 17  You can return your screen to normal as follows. In the same way that you created SCREEN.TXT, create NORMAL.TXT with the following single line:  [37;40M  After you enter this line, save the file. At the DOS prompt, enter the following to return your screen to normal: TYPE NORMAL.TXT  Issuing ANSI.SYS Codes with the PROMPT Command  The third way to issue ANSI.SYS instructions is to include these instructions in a PROMPT command. You learned about the PROMPT command in Chapter 11, “Controlling Your Environment.” In short, the PROMPT command alters the way the DOS prompt appears. The normal syntax of the command is as follows: PROMPT string  The string consists of a set of characters that might or might not include an ANSI Escape sequence. The characters you enter tell DOS how you want the DOS prompt to look. For full information on the characters you can use with the command, refer to Chapter 11. This section focuses on using the ANSI sequences with the PROMPT command.  To add more pizzazz to your DOS prompt, you can add color, as outlined in the following examples. If you have a color monitor, enter the following command, using nine spaces for the nine periods: PROMPT $E[1;37;44mTime: $T$H$H$H$H$H$H.........$E[40m$E[K$_$E[1;44mDate: ➥ $D$E[0;40m$E[K$_[DOS 6.2] $P$G  The display shows the time and date in bright white text on a blue background, returning to normal white on black for the prompt.  If you have a monochrome monitor, enter the following command, using nine spaces for the nine periods: PROMPT $E[7mTime: $T$H$H$H$H$H$H.........$E[0m$E[K$_$E[7mDate: ➥$D$E[0m$E[K$_[DOS 6.2] $P$G  The display now shows the time and date in black characters on a white background, return- ing to normal white on black for the prompt.  As the inclusion of [DOS 6.2] in these two examples indicates, you also can display a mes- sage in the DOS prompt.  The brackets are included for cosmetic purposes only. They are not required.  Be creative. Beam me up, Scotty; The BRAIN; USA Forever; and BOOM! are a few examples of DOS users’ humor and imagination.  Controlling Your Screen with ANSI.SYS  Now that you understand how to issue ANSI.SYS commands in batch files, in text files, and as part of a PROMPT command, you’re ready to use ANSI.SYS commands to control and cus- tomize your screen display.   420  Chapter 17 Understanding ANSI.SYS  All ANSI screen commands begin with the normal Escape code and a left bracket  [  and end with a letter of the alphabet. The letter depends on the type of command you are asking ANSI.SYS to execute. In all instances, the capitalization of the ending letter is important. As you are working through the examples in this chapter, pay strict attention to the capitaliza- tion.  You can use as many ANSI control codes as you require on the same line, as long as the codes are separated by semicolons  ;  and no code contradicts another code. The order of the codes is not important.  The following sections detail the general functions that can be performed with ANSI.SYS.  Cursor Movement  If you end the Escape sequence with the uppercase letter A, ANSI.SYS assumes you want to move the cursor up a given number of lines on the screen. For instance, the following line moves the cursor up four lines on the screen:  [4A  The horizontal position of the cursor is not affected; it only moves up. If the cursor is already at the top of the screen, the Escape code is ignored.  If you end the Escape sequence with a B  instead of an A , the cursor is moved down on the screen. Again, if the cursor is already at the bottom of the screen, the sequence is ignored.  Ending the Escape sequence with a C moves the cursor to the right by the number of indi- cated spaces; a D moves the cursor left. For example, the following line moves the cursor 23 spaces to the right:  [23C  Cursor Positioning  To position the cursor at a given character location on the screen, you can use either the H or f codes. For instance, either of the following moves the cursor to line 10, column 32:  [10;32H   [10;32f  Note that the upper-left corner of the screen is considered position 0,0.  To save the current cursor position  in preparation for moving and later restoring it , you use the s code, as shown here:  [s  There are no other parameters; the cursor position is immediately saved. When you want to restore the cursor to the saved position, use the u code:  [u   Controlling Your Screen with ANSI.SYS  421  Setting the Screen Mode  You can use ANSI.SYS to change the display mode of your system. You do so by providing  a screen code and ending the sequence with the h code. The screen codes are listed in  Table 17.1.  Table 17.1 ANSI Screen Display Codes  Code 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  14  15  16  17  18  19  Screen Type 40×25 characters, monochrome  40×25 characters, color  80×25 characters, monochrome  80×25 characters, color  320×200 pixels, monochrome  320×200 pixels, color  640×200 pixels, monochrome  Turns word wrap on and off  640×200 pixels, color  640×360 pixels, monochrome  640×360 pixels, color  640×480 pixels, monochrome  640×480 pixels, color  320×200 pixels, color  Part IV Ch 17  For example, the following line sets the screen mode to 80×25 color text:  [3h  You can end the sequence also with a lowercase l; the only difference is in how screen code 7 is handled. With the h code, line wrap is turned on; with l, it is turned off. For instance, the following turns on 80×25 monochrome text with screen wrapping disabled:  [2;7l  Setting the Text Attributes  Text attributes include color, bold, or reverse video. To set these attributes, list the desired attribute codes, separated by semicolons, and then terminate the Escape sequence with the m code. Table 17.2 lists the ANSI codes for setting the character attributes.   422  Chapter 17 Understanding ANSI.SYS  Table 17.2  Character Attribute Codes  Code 0  1  4  5  7  8  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  Effect Normal display  the default   High-intensity text  Underlined text  monochrome   Blinking text  Reverse video  black on white   Hidden text  black on black   Black foreground  character  color  Red foreground  character  color  Green foreground  character  color  Yellow foreground  character  color  Blue foreground  character  color  Magenta foreground  character  color  Cyan foreground  character  color  White foreground  character  color  Black background color  Red background color  Green background color  Yellow background color  Blue background color  Magenta background color  Cyan background color  White background color  Some screen effects depend on the hardware. Underlined text, for example, cannot be dis- played on all monitors.  You can use the codes in Table 17.2 to customize your system. You can, for example, use ANSI codes to set the default screen colors to bright green on black:  [1;32;40m   Customizing Your Keyboard with ANSI.SYS  423  Screen Control  Besides the functions discussed so far, ANSI.SYS also provides functions that you can use to control your screen. You can use the following ANSI code to clear the screen. It is the equivalent of the CLS command:  [2J  If you want to erase only to the end of the current line, the following does the trick:  [K  Customizing Your Keyboard with ANSI.SYS  Computers use a set of 256 codes to indicate specific characters. These codes make up the ASCII character set.  ASCII is an acronym for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  A space, for example, is ASCII code 48; the uppercase A is ASCII code 65; and the lowercase a is ASCII code 97. You already know that the Escape code used in an ANSI control sequence has an ASCII value of 27.  See Appendix E, “ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes,” for a list of ASCII codes.   Every time you press a key on your keyboard, the system’s circuits send a code to DOS. This code interprets the keystroke and displays the appropriate character. Not every code in the ASCII set, however, has a corresponding keyboard key. Moreover, some keys represent more than one character.  Keyboards actually send individual codes to DOS for each key or key combination you press on the keyboard. These codes are known as scan codes. Many scan codes correspond to ASCII codes. With the key combinations that involve the Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Num Lock keys, however, more than 256 keystrokes  the ASCII code limit  are possible. This problem is solved by preceding some scan codes with a 0 entry.  When DOS receives a scan code from the keyboard, the program uses a built-in table to ascertain the proper character. When the ANSI.SYS device driver has been loaded through the CONFIG.SYS file, the ANSI driver takes over this chore. The driver also enables you to modify the table and assign different characters to the scan codes.  Suppose that you must prepare documents or data files that include fractions. You can assign ASCII codes for some fractions to keys that you normally don’t use. ASCII code 171, for example, stands for 1 2, and code 172 stands for 1 4.  See Appendix E for a complete list of ASCII codes.  Using ANSI.SYS makes key reassignments easy.  To assign the 1 2 fraction  ASCII 171  to the Shift+6 key combination, which produces the character ^  ASCII 94 , you can use either of the following commands:  [“^”;”1 2”p   [94;171p  Part IV Ch 17   424  Chapter 17 Understanding ANSI.SYS  The ANSI.SYS keyboard-assignment Escape sequence starts with the standard Escape charac- ter, followed by a left bracket  [ . The next character is the ASCII code, scan code, or key representation in quotation marks. Then you specify the new ASCII code or key representa- tion in quotation marks. The two characters are separated by a semicolon. The sequence ends with the lowercase p code. Thus, in the first example, the key representation ^ is entered with quotation marks  “^”  and is changed to “1 2”. In the second example, scan code 171 replaces scan code 94.  Do not use spaces in the ANSI.SYS code sequence. If you use spaces, DOS might not interpret the sequence properly.  Remember that the first specification is for the key to be assigned. To restore the original key assignment, enter the code twice, as in this example:  [94;94p  A key assignment does not need to be a single character. You also can assign a text message to a keystroke. This process is referred to as a macro substitution. If you often need to type the same sequence of characters, you can easily set up a macro substitution that enters those characters for you. Don’t confuse this with the macro capability of DOSKEY, however. Macros that can be created with DOSKEY are much more powerful than those created with ANSI.SYS.  In the following example, the words Heigh-Ho, Silver! are assigned to the F7 key, which has the scan code 0;65:  [0;65;”Heigh-Ho, Silver!”p  After you issue this ANSI.SYS instruction, either in a text file you type or a batch file, DOS  through ANSI.SYS  displays the message Heigh-Ho, Silver! whenever you press F7.  Because no scan code or ASCII code of 0 exists, ANSI.SYS understands that the second num- ber indicates the extended scan code for the F7 key instead of the ASCII code for the upper- case A, which is 65. If you want to add a carriage return  ASCII code 13  after the message, include that code in the Escape sequence as follows:  [0;65;”Heigh-Ho, Silver!”;13p  You can enter many of the ASCII character codes on your keyboard by holding down the Alt key while you type the ASCII code for the character you want to display. If you reassign keys, however, you no longer can enter certain key characters in this manner. Further, reas- signed keys no longer function the same way. If you reassign the backslash key  \ , for exam- ple, you no longer can use the backslash character to access subdirectories.  Reassigning Character Keys  ANSI.SYS reassignmentof normal character keys on your keyboard is not a good idea. Such a reassignment interferes with the normal operation of DOS and with many, if not all, of your software programs.   ANSI Control Codes  425  When you use ANSI.SYS to reassign keys, keep in mind that DOS allows a total of 200 characters. If your key reassignments take more than 200 bytes, you overwrite part of the command processor in memory and your system might lock up.  ANSI Control Codes  All ANSI commands are prefixed by two characters: the Escape character  ASCII 27  and the left square bracket  ASCII 91 . Because the Escape keypress usually is interpreted as a command, inserting it in a text file might require you to enter a special command, such as Ctrl+P, before your text editor will accept it as text.  Uppercase and lowercase are significant in these commands, so you must type them exactly as indicated. In commands that allow a variable number of codes, separate each code with a semicolon.  ANSI Set and Reset Display Mode Control Codes  Set mode codes end in a lowercase h as shown. Reset mode codes substitute a lowercase l for the h. Not all displays support all screen modes, and other modes might be available for your display:  Part IV Ch 17   [=0h   [=1h   [=2h   [=3h   [=4h   [=5h   [=6h   [=13h   [=14h   [=15h   [=16h   [=17h   [=18h   [=19h  Text mode Text mode Text mode Text mode Graphics mode Graphics mode Graphics mode Graphics mode Graphics mode Graphics mode Graphics mode Graphics mode Graphics mode Graphics mode  40×25 40×25 80×25 80×25 320×200 320×200 640×200 320×200 640×200 640×350 640×350 640×480 640×480 320×200  Monochrome Color Monochrome Color 4 color Monochrome Monochrome Color 16 color 2 color 16 color 2 color 16 color 256 color  ANSI Display Color and Attribute Control Codes  Background color, foreground color, and screen attribute codes may be combined in a single command. If any of the choices conflict, the rightmost color or attribute in the command is set. Not all colors or attributes are available on all displays:   426  Chapter 17 Understanding ANSI.SYS   [code;...;codem 0 1 4  Set Display Color Attribute All attributes off Bold or bright characters Underlined characters  monochrome display  adapter only  Blinking characters Reverse video characters Hidden or invisible characters Foreground color: black Foreground color: red Foreground color: green Foreground color: yellow Foreground color: blue Foreground color: magenta Foreground color: cyan Foreground color: white Background color: black Background color: red Background color: green Background color: yellow Background color: blue Background color: magenta Background color: cyan Background color: white  5 7 8 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47  ANSI Cursor Control Codes   [row;colH   [row;colF   [numA   [numB   [numC  Cursor position.

Some software application programs ignore key- board reassignments set this way.  [keycode;keytext;...p  keycode indicates one of the key codes listed in the following table. Some keys use two codes, in which case both must be entered, separated by a semicolon as shown. Keycodes that appear in parentheses might not be available on all keyboards.  Do not include the parentheses.  Also, some keyboards use different codes for certain keys. Check your comput- er’s documentation.  keytext is either the ASCII code for a single character or text enclosed in double quotation marks. For example, both 83 and “S” can be used to represent an uppercase S. “Hello” also is allowed; it returns the full word when the key is pressed.  In the following table, keys indicated as  gray  refer to the gray-colored cursor pad area of the keyboard. Keys indicated as  keypad  refer to the numeric keypad area. Key codes that appear in parentheses are not available on all keyboards, and ANSI.SYS might not interpret them if the  X switch is not specified in the device command that loaded it.

The program also enables you to create new commands, referred to as macros, that can take the place of several DOS commands. Another benefit of DOSKEY is that it occu- pies only about 4KB of memory when loaded. The following sections explain how to load DOSKEY into your computer’s memory and use the program’s capabilities.  Loading DOSKEY  DOSKEY is a memory-resident program that was first available in DOS 5.0. This program enables you to easily edit what you enter at the DOS prompt. DOSKEY also maintains a running history of the commands you have entered. DOSKEY then enables you to reuse those commands without retyping them.  Before you can use DOSKEY’s features, you must load the program into memory. To load DOSKEY, enter the following command at the DOS prompt: DOSKEY  A message appears onscreen, telling you that DOSKEY is installed. After this message appears, all DOSKEY features are available.  The most convenient way to load DOSKEY is to include a command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to start the program. In this way, DOSKEY loads every time you start your computer. It is also easier to take advantage of loading DOSKEY in upper memory.  As is true of most DOS commands, DOSKEY has several available switches. The full syntax of the command to install DOSKEY is as follows: DOSKEY  REINSTALL  BUFSIZE=size  MACROS  HISTORY  INSERT  OVERSTRIKE  Following are explanations of the components of this command:     REINSTALL—Installs another copy of DOSKEY and clears the command-history buffer. This command does not, however, remove existing copies of DOSKEY that already are in memory.     BUFSIZE—Sets the size of the command buffer. The size parameter represents the  number of bytes that the buffer occupies in memory. The default size is 512 bytes; the minimum size is 256 bytes.     MACROS—Displays a list of the currently defined DOSKEY macros.    HISTORY—Displays the contents of the command-history buffer.    INSERT—Instructs DOS to insert new text into the existing text at the cursor position.   You cannot use this switch with  OVERSTRIKE.      OVERSTRIKE—Instructs DOS to insert new text in place of existing text at the cursor  position. This condition is the default.  You cannot use this switch with  INSERT   Using DOSKEY  433  Editing the Command Line  Even before you load DOSKEY, DOS provides some command-line editing capability. Table 18.1 lists the normal DOS command-line editing keys, which are available if DOSKEY is not memory-resident.  Table 18.1 DOS Command-Line Editing Keys  Action Moves the cursor to the following tab stop  Cancels the current line and does not change the buffer  Enables you to insert characters into the preceding command line  Deletes a character from the preceding command line  F1 or right arrow  Copies one character from the preceding command line  Copies all characters from the preceding command line up to, but not including, the next character you type  Copies all remaining characters from the preceding command line  Deletes all characters from the preceding command line up to, but not including, the next character typed  the opposite of F2   Moves the current line into the buffer but prevents DOS from executing the line  Produces an end-of-file marker  ^Z  when you copy from the console to a disk file  Part IV Ch 18  Key Tab  Esc  Ins  Del  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  A primary purpose of DOSKEY is to facilitate editing of DOS commands. If you are a typi- cal PC user, you issue the same or similar commands frequently, and you don’t always type each command correctly the first time. DOSKEY can save you typing by enabling you to edit commands without typing them from scratch every time you notice an error.  Suppose that you want to see a directory listing of all files with the .WQ1 extension in the \SPREADSH\QPRO2DAT directory in drive C. In haste, however, you type the DIR command as follows: DOR C:\SPREADSH\QPRO2DAT\*.WQ1  Before you press Enter, you realize that you mistyped the DIR command, but you don’t want to retype it. When DOSKEY is loaded, you can use the following procedure to correct the mistake:  1. Press the Home key to move the cursor to the left end of the command line. 2. Use the right-arrow key to move the cursor to the O in the word DOR. 3. Type I to correct the error. 4. Press Enter.   434  Chapter 18 Mastering DOSKEY and Macros  DOS displays the directory listing as you requested.  Another quick way to repeat the command is to press the F1 key. Each time it is pressed, it repeats a character of the previous command. Although this technique is more limited, in that it does not enable you to edit a character and then continue repeating, it can be help- ful if DOSKEY was not activated before you typed the command.  The keys listed in Table 18.2 supplement the normal DOSKEY command-line editing keys.  Table 18.2 Additional DOSKEY Command-Line Editing Keys  Action Moves the cursor one character to the left  Moves the cursor one character to the right  Moves the cursor one character to the left; erases the character to the left  Ctrl+left arrow  Moves the cursor one word to the left  Ctrl+right arrow  Moves the cursor one word to the right  Toggles between Replace mode  the default  and Insert mode  Moves the cursor to the left end of the command line  Moves the cursor to the space after the last character in the command line  Erases the command line  Key Left arrow  Right arrow  Backspace  Ins  Home  End  Esc  Reusing Commands  In addition to enhancing DOS’s command-line editing capabilities, DOSKEY adds a capa- bility that was not previously available in DOS: You can redisplay a command that you issued earlier during the current DOS session. You then can execute the command without changing it, or you can use the DOS and DOSKEY editing keys to make modifications before executing the command.  After you load DOSKEY into memory, the program maintains a buffer in memory that con- tains a history of DOS commands issued at the command prompt during the current DOS session. DOSKEY enables you to reuse the commands in this command-history buffer.  Suppose that earlier during the current DOS session, you issued the following COPY command: COPY C:\DATABASE\FOXPRO\MAIL.DBF C:\WORDPRO\WP  Now you want to issue the following similar command without retyping the entire  command: COPY C:\DATABASE\DBASE\MAIL.DBF C:\WORDPRO\WP   Using DOSKEY  435  To edit the earlier command, follow these steps:  1. Press the up-arrow key repeatedly until the original COPY command appears on the  command line.  2. Use the DOS and DOSKEY editing keys to change the command. 3. Press Enter.  In addition to the up-arrow key, DOSKEY provides the keys listed in Table 18.3 for use in retrieving commands from the command-history buffer.  Table 18.3  DOSKEY Command-History Buffer Keys  Key Up arrow  Down arrow  Action Displays] the preceding DOS command.  Alt+F7  Alt+F10  Clears the command-history buffer.  Clears all macro definitions.  Displays the DOS command issued after the one currently displayed, or displays a blank line when you are at the end of the list.  F7  F8  F9  PgDn  PgUp  Displays the contents of the command-history buffer in a numbered list.  Searches for the command that most closely matches the characters typed at the command line. Prompts for a line number, where line number refers to the number displayed next to a command in the command-history listing generated by pressing F7. Type the number to display the corresponding command.  Displays the last command stored in the DOSKEY command buffer.  Displays ]the earliest command issued that still is stored in the DOSKEY com- mand buffer.  Part IV Ch 18  To view the entire list of commands currently stored in the command-history buffer, press F7. DOSKEY lists all commands contained in the buffer, one on each line, with a number at the left end of each line. The oldest command—the command issued earliest in the current DOS session—is number one. Subsequent commands are listed in the order in which you issued them.  DOSKEY provides another way for you to see the entire list of commands in the command- history buffer. Type the following command and then press Enter: DOSKEY  HISTORY  DOSKEY generates the same list of commands as the F7 command, but without line  numbers.  To create a batch file that contains all the commands in the current command-history buffer, use the following command syntax: DOSKEY  HISTORY > filename.BAT   436  Chapter 18 Mastering DOSKEY and Macros  Substitute for filename the name that you want to give the batch file. After you issue this command, the new batch file contains all the commands from the command-history buffer, including the command that created the batch file itself. Use the DOS Editor, Edlin, or some other text editor to delete the last command and any other commands you don’t want to include in the batch file.  You can use the up-arrow key to display previously issued commands. Each time you press the up-arrow key, DOSKEY displays the preceding command. After you display one or more previous commands by pressing the up-arrow key, you can use the down-arrow key to move back down through the commands to the most recent command. Sometimes, however, selecting a command from the list generated by pressing F7 is easier. To use this method, press F9. DOSKEY displays the following message: Line number:  Type the number that corresponds to the desired command in the list of commands generat- ed by pressing F7. DOSKEY displays the selected command in the command line for you to edit or execute.  When you want to move quickly to the first command in the buffer, press PgUp. To go to the last command in the buffer, press PgDn.  If you want to clear the command-history buffer, press Alt+F7. DOSKEY abandons the con- tents of the command-history buffer.  DOSKEY also can help you locate a command quickly. Type the first several characters of the command you need to find and then press F8. Suppose that you want to locate the fol- lowing command: COPY C:\DATABASE\FOXPRO\MAIL.DBF C:\WORDPRO\WP  Type COPY and press F8. Each time you press F8, DOSKEY shows you the next command that contains the COPY command. When the desired command is displayed, you easily can edit and reuse the command with minimal typing.  Creating and Using Macros  In addition to providing command-line editing capabilities and the command-history buffer, DOSKEY enables you to create your own DOS commands, referred to as macros. A DOSKEY macro is similar to a batch file but is contained in memory rather than on disk. Each macro can contain one or more DOS commands, up to a maximum of 127 characters.  DOSKEY macros are similar to batch files in the following ways:    Macros can contain multiple DOS commands.   You invoke macros by typing a name at the DOS prompt.   Macros can use replaceable parameters.   Creating and Using Macros  437  Macros differ from batch files in the following ways:    Macros are stored in memory  RAM ; batch files are stored on disk.   Macros are limited to 127 characters; batch files have unlimited maximum length.   Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break stops a single command in a DOSKEY macro; Ctrl+C or  Ctrl+Break stops an entire batch file.    The GOTO command is not available in macros.   One macro cannot call another macro, and you cannot call a macro from within a batch  file.    Macros can define environment variables but cannot use them.  The following sections explain how to create and run DOSKEY macros.  Creating Macros  DOSKEY enables you to create macros at the command line or through a batch file. The syntax for creating a macro is as follows: DOSKEY macroname=command s   The macroname parameter is the name that you want to give the macro. Use any keyboard characters in the name except  , , or =. Do not include a space in the macro name; use an underscore or hyphen instead if you want the macro name to have the appearance of two words.  The command parameter can include any number of DOS commands, subject to the follow- ing rules:  Part IV Ch 18    The entire command cannot exceed 127 characters  the DOS command-line limit .   Each pair of commands must be separated by $t.   Instead of using the redirection and piping operators  , and , use $l, $g, and $b,  respectively.    The ECHO OFF command is not effective in macros. Commands always appear onscreen.  You can use several special characters when defining your macros. They are shown in  Table 18.4.  Table 18.4  Special Characters for Use in DOSKEY Macros  Character $G or $g  $G$G or $g$g  Meaning Redirects output; used in place of the greater-than sign  >   Redirects and appends output; used in place of the double greater-than  sign  >>   $L or $l  Redirects input; used in place of the less-than sign  <    438  Chapter 18 Mastering DOSKEY and Macros  Table 18.4 Continued  Character $B or $b  Meaning Uses output from one command as input to another; used in place of the ver- tical bar     $T or $t  Separates commands on the DOSKEY command line  Prints the dollar sign character  $1 through $9  Indicates individual replaceable parameters  Indicates all parameters  $$  $*  Notice that when you want to use replaceable parameters in a macro, you use the codes $1 through $9 rather than %1 through %9. Suppose, for example, that you often use the REPLACE command to keep current copies of particular subdirectory files on floppy disks so that you can take the files with you. To do so, however, you must issue the REPLACE command twice for each subdirectory you want to keep current. An easier method is to create the following macro called UPD: DOSKEY UPD=REPLACE \C:$1\$2 A:\$1  U $T REPLACE C:\$1\$2 A:\$1  A  In this example, you also see how the $T  or $t  special characters separate commands on the command line.  DOSKEY has a special type of replaceable parameter that is not available in batch files. The characters $* represent not just one parameter, but all the characters you type in the com- mand line to the right of the macro name. This type of replaceable parameter is useful when you don’t know ahead of time how many parameters or switches you might type when you execute the macro.  Suppose, for example, that you want to create a macro to help format floppy disks in drive A, a 3 1 2-inch, high-density drive. You want to be able to type FA 720 to format a 720KB disk and FA 1.44 to format a 1.44MB disk. Occasionally, however, you might want to use one or more of FORMAT’s switches, such as the  S switch to create a system disk, the  Q Quick Format switch, or the  U unconditional format switch. To create the FA macro, you type the following command: DOSKEY FA=FORMAT A:  F:$*  To confirm that DOSKEY has stored the macros you defined, you type the following com- mand and then press Enter: DOSKEY  MACROS  DOSKEY lists all macros currently stored in the DOSKEY macro buffer. Assuming you defined the UPD and FA macros, the preceding command displays the following lines: UPD=REPLACE \C:$1\$2 A:\$1  U $T REPLACE C:\$1\$2 A:\$1  A FA=FORMAT A:  F:$*   Creating and Using Macros  439  You can easily save a copy of the entire contents of the macro buffer by using redirection. To create a file named MACROS.BAT that contains all the current macros, you type the follow- ing command and press Enter: DOSKEY  MACROS > MACROS.BAT  If you want to use this batch file later to re-create the macros during a future session, edit the file, adding DOSKEY to the beginning of each line.  Because DOSKEY macros reside in memory rather than on disk, all macros are erased when you turn off or reboot the computer. One disadvantage of using DOSKEY macros is that you need to reenter commonly used macros each time you turn on your computer. You can overcome this drawback, however, by using AUTOEXEC.BAT to define the macros that you use most often. To make the UPD and FA macros routinely available, for example, include the fol- lowing commands in AUTOEXEC.BAT: DOSKEY UPD=REPLACE \C:$1\$2 A:\$1  U $T REPLACE C:\$1\$2 A:\$1  A DOSKEY FA=FORMAT A:  F:$*  Every time you turn on or reboot your computer, the preceding commands create the UPD and FA macros in the DOSKEY macro buffer.  The first DOSKEY command in AUTOEXEC.BAT loads the program as memory-resident, even if the command also is defining a macro.  Running Macros  Using a DOSKEY macro is as easy as using any other DOS command. Simply type the macro name at the command line and then press Enter. If the macro has any replaceable parameters, include appropriate values in the command line. Suppose, for example, that  you want to use the UPD macro to maintain current copies of files. To do so, just type the  following: UPD dirname filespec  As with a batch file, dirname is the first replaceable parameter, $1, and filespec is the sec- ond, $2. To keep current all files in C:\PROJECT1, type the following at the DOS prompt: UPD PROJECT1 *.*  Perhaps you want to use the FA macro created in the preceding section to format a 1.44MB disk. You want to use Quick Format, make this disk bootable, and assign the volume label BOOT_DISK. You type the following command at the DOS prompt and then press Enter: FA 1.44  Q  S  V:BOOT_DISK  DOS first displays the command in the following format: FORMAT A:  F:1.44  Q  S  V:BOOT_DISK  Part IV Ch 18   440  Chapter 18 Mastering DOSKEY and Macros  Then DOS prompts you as follows: Insert new diskette for drive A: and press ENTER when ready_  Press Enter to proceed with the formatting operation. DOS displays messages indicating the progress and successful completion of the procedure. Finally, DOS displays the following message: QuickFormat another  Y N ?  Press Y if you want to use the same switch settings to format another disk or press N to return to the DOS prompt.  Deleting Macros  You can remove a macro from memory simply by putting nothing to the right of the equal sign when you define the macro. Assume, for example, that you no longer need the FA macro defined earlier. To remove it from memory—thereby freeing more space for other macros—type the following at the DOS prompt: DOSKEY FA=  If you use a macro name that is the same as an existing DOS command, you effectively replace the DOS command with the macro.

They are based on the same family of computer chips, and they have similar components, such as memory, hard disks, and power supplies. Still, the differences between various makes and models of personal comput- ers are greater today than ever before. DOS gives you the tools to fine-tune the operation of every element of your computer system, an exercise often called configuring your system. You can adjust a bewildering number of settings; how you manipulate these settings greatly affects how efficiently your PC works. Sadly, the people who do not understand how to con- figure their PCs greatly outnumber the people who do. By reading this chapter, you can become one of the latter.  Fortunately, the folks at Microsoft realize that configuring a modern PC can be challenging for most users, and perhaps the most important tool that Microsoft includes with DOS is MemMaker, a tool that performs the hardest part of the configuration automatically. If you want to call yourself a PC guru, you need to understand the configuration process; but if you’re a novice user, the worst part of working with MS-DOS just disappeared.  The default configuration of DOS, which might be adequate for many users, is designed as a “lowest common denominator,” intended to work with the greatest number of systems. As PC technology advances, DOS also must enable users of the most up-to-date systems to take full advantage of their computers’ most powerful features. This chapter describes how to use DOS to create the optimal configuration for your computer system, whether your system is a plain vanilla PC or a banana split with all the toppings.  Whether you use your own computer or a computer owned by your employer, someone has invested a significant sum of money in the system. This chapter helps you discover how to configure your computer to operate most efficiently—how to get the “most bang for the buck.” You generally can improve the performance of software running on your PC in two ways: You can increase the amount of memory available to the software, and you can increase the speed at which your system or its components operate. You can tackle these efficiency-oriented goals in two general ways:    Add or replace hardware   Use software to attain an optimal configuration for your existing hardware resources  DOS fits into the software category. This chapter teaches you how to use DOS to increase the amount of memory available to applications. The chapter also explains how to use spe- cial device drivers and utility programs to enhance the performance of your hard disk, which in turn enhances software performance.   Understanding Device Drivers  443  Understanding Device Drivers  MS-DOS certain features that every DOS user needs. Regardless of the type of computer you use or the software you run, you must be capable of creating directories, accessing files, and printing to your printer. Many other features, however, might not be important to you, depending on the type of computer you have and how you use it. If you plan to use a mouse with DOS, DOS must load the mouse-handling functions when your computer boots. If you don’t plan to use a mouse, loading the mouse-handling functions ties up valuable memory, a sacrifice you don’t want to make.  To give you the flexibility of using only the parts of DOS that you need, DOS consists of a base portion  which contains the features that everybody needs  and a series of what you might think of as “plug-in modules”  pieces of programs that give DOS the instructions it needs to perform certain tasks . Because you can decide which of the optional modules to use, you don’t waste memory-loading features you don’t need.  These plug-in modules are called device drivers because they generally give DOS the infor- mation needed to access various types of hardware devices. In addition to the device drivers that come with DOS, some add-on hardware comes with a device driver that enables your system to recognize and use the hardware. If, for example, you buy a mouse to use with your computer, you also must load the appropriate device driver so that DOS knows how to con- trol the mouse.  Most device drivers are loaded in your CONFIG.SYS file. One of the most important tasks this file performs is to tell DOS which device drivers to load when the computer boots. The DEVICE command tells DOS to load a device driver and uses the following syntax: DEVICE = filespec  switches  filespec is the complete filename  and optional disk and path  for the device driver file, and  switches are any switches the device driver software needs.  If you buy a Microsoft mouse, for example, you also get a device driver called MOUSE.SYS that tells DOS how to use the mouse. If you place MOUSE.SYS in the root directory of your C drive, you can load MOUSE.SYS by adding the following command to CONFIG.SYS: DEVICE = C:\MOUSE.SYS   The spaces around the equal sign in this syntax are optional.   You can load as many device drivers as you need, but you must use a separate DEVICE com- mand for each driver you install.  Most users create a special subdirectory called \DRIVERS or \SYS and put the driver files in this directory so that they are out of the way of daily files. If you put the driver files in a sep- arate subdirectory, you must specify the pathname as part of the name of the device driver, as shown in the following examples: DEVICE = C:\DRIVERS\MOUSE.SYS  DEVICE = C:\SYS\MOUSE.SYS  Part IV Ch 19   444  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  Table 19.1 lists the device driver files included with DOS 6.22  Table 19.1 DOS 6.22 Device Drivers  DISPLAY.SYS  Provides support for code-page switching to the screen.

Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  445  When you install DOS, you might notice that DOS installs two files that appear to be device drivers because they end in the .SYS extension: COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS. Despite their extension, these files are not device drivers; they are used internally by other DOS commands, and you cannot use them in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  In Chapter 1, “DOS and the Personal Computer,” you learned about memory and how it relates to your PC. With that understanding in mind, you are ready to learn how you can make the most of your PC’s memory.  ➔ To learn more about the CONFIG.SYS file and how it works, see “Starting DOS,” p. 23.  Using Extended Memory and HIMEM.SYS  In terms of optimizing your computer, the most significant feature offered by DOS is the capability to load most of the operating system software into extended memory. By doing so, DOS provides more conventional memory for applications, ultimately improving the perfor- mance of your system.  Understanding HIMEM.SYS  Before DOS or applications software can use extended memory, you must add a command to your CONFIG.SYS file to load an Extended Memory Manager—a driver that provides a standard way for applications to address extended memory so that no two programs use the same portion of extended memory at the same time. DOS 4.0 and later versions include the Extended Memory Manager HIMEM.SYS.  HIMEM.SYS manages memory according to the rules set out in the Extended Memory Specification  XMS  Version 2.0. According to this specification, three areas of memory above the conventional 640KB barrier can be made available for programs to use:  Part IV Ch 19    Upper memory area  UMA —This area consists of the 384KB of memory above  640KB up to 1MB and is divided into many different-size blocks, called upper memory blocks  UMBs .    High memory area  HMA —This is a single block of memory essentially consisting of  the first 64KB of extended memory. However, the HMA slightly overlaps the upper memory area; the last 16 bytes of the upper memory area are the first 16 bytes of the high memory area.  Most people are not aware of this slight overlap, and it can be a good way to win bar bets.     Extended memory blocks  XMS memory —This portion of memory includes all  memory above 1,024KB. When extended memory is managed by an Extended Memory Manager, you refer to the memory as XMS memory.   446  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  The terms used to describe DOS memory can be maddening. Try not to confuse high mem- ory with upper memory.  When used on an x86 PC, HIMEM.SYS provides HMA and XMS memory to programs that know how to use it. To access upper memory, however, the PC must have at least an 80386 CPU or higher, and you must include one of the following device driver commands in  CONFIG.SYS after HIMEM.SYS is loaded: DEVICE=EMM386.EXE RAM  DEVICE=EMM386.EXE NOEMS  Refer to the next section for a full discussion of EMM386.EXE.  The syntax for using HIMEM.SYS is shown in the following: DEVICE=d:path\HIMEM.SYS  A20CONTROL:ONOFF  NUMHANDLES=n  EISA  HMAMIN=n INT15=xxxx  MACHINE:xx  SHADOWRAM:ONOFF  CPUCLOCK:ONOFF  QUIET  d: is the disk drive where the HIMEM.SYS resides, and path\ is the directory containing the device driver file. If HIMEM.SYS is contained in the \DOS directory on your C drive, for exam- ple, you include the following command in CONFIG.SYS: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS  In most cases, you need only this command to activate the Extended Memory Manager. In special cases, however, you might need to use one of the available switches described in the following paragraphs. The next section continues the discussion of loading DOS into upper memory.  According to XMS specifications, only one program at a time can use the high memory area. The switch  HMAMIN=n sets the minimum amount of memory that must be requested by an application before the application is permitted to use HMA. If you load DOS into HMA, you can omit this switch, as explained in the section “Loading DOS into High Memory” later in this chapter.  When the Extended Memory Manager assigns memory to a particular program, it assigns one or more extended memory block handles to the program. The  NUMHANDLES=n switch indicates the maximum number of handles available. The number n must be between 1 and 128. The default is 32 handles, usually a sufficient number. Each reserved handle requires an additional 6 bytes of memory. Unless you are running software that complains about not having enough extended memory handles, you probably do not need this option.  Most current versions of commercial software support the XMS specification for addressing extended memory. Some older versions of programs, however, use a different method of addressing extended memory, known as the Interrupt 15h  INT15h  interface. If you work with software that uses the INT15h interface and you want to load DOS into HMA, add the  INT15=xxxx switch. The number xxxx indicates the amount of extended memory you want HIMEM.SYS to assign to the INT15h interface. This number must be from 64 to 65,535  kilo- bytes , and the default is 0. If you assign some of your extended memory to the INT15h interface, that memory is not available to programs that expect the XMS interface.   Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  447  Internally, DOS uses a wire called the A20 memory address line to access the high memory area. What the A20 address line is and how DOS uses it are not important here, but not all brands of PCs handle the A20 line in the same way. Normally, HIMEM.SYS can detect how your computer uses its A20 line, but if it is incorrect, HIMEM.SYS displays the following error message: Unable to control A20  If you see this message, use the  MACHINE:xx switch in the HIMEM.SYS command to specify which type of A20 handler your machine uses. For xx in the  MACHINE switch, insert the code that matches your computer. You can find the text codes in the Code column and the num- ber codes in the Number column in Table 19.2. If you see the error message but your com- puter is not listed in Table 19.2, try the switch  MACHINE:1.

By default, HIMEM.SYS takes control of A20 even though the line is turned on when HIMEM.SYS loads. HIMEM.SYS warns you when this condition occurs by displaying the following message:  Part IV Ch 19   448  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  Warning: The A20 Line was already enabled!  Determine see whether you really intend to have both drivers installed at one time. If so, you can prevent HIMEM.SYS from taking control of A20 by adding the switch  A20CONTROL:OFF  the default setting is  A20CONTROL:ON .  All PCs store some of their basic operating instructions in read-only memory  ROM ; how- ever, computers usually cannot access instructions from ROM as fast as they can access instructions from RAM. If you have plenty of memory and an 80386  or better  computer, you can usually increase the performance of your computer by asking the computer to copy the instructions from ROM into an upper memory block  which is RAM . This technique is known as shadow RAM.  Shadow RAM uses some of your upper memory blocks. If you prefer to increase the amount of upper memory available for device drivers and memory-resident programs, use the  SHAD- OWRAM:OFF switch. As HIMEM.SYS loads, the following message appears: Shadow RAM disabled.  In some cases, DOS cannot turn off shadow RAM. Instead, DOS displays a message telling you that shadow RAM is in use and cannot be disabled.  Check your hardware documenta- tion for other methods of disabling shadow RAM.   The  CPUCLOCK:ON switch ensures that HIMEM.SYS does not slow your computer’s clock speed, the speed at which your computer processes instructions.  Any change in clock speed does not affect your computer’s real-time clock, which keeps time of day.  On the front panel of many PCs is an LED or other indicator that indicates the current clock speed. To prevent the clock speed from slowing, add the  CPUCLOCK:ON switch to the DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS com- mand in CONFIG.SYS.  If you are using a machine that uses an Extended Industry Standard Architecture  EISA  bus with more than 16MB of memory, HIMEM.SYS does not normally allocate all the extended memory. Use the  EISA switch to tell HIMEM.SYS to automatically allocate all available extended memory.  When HIMEM.SYS loads, it usually prints status messages. If you want HIMEM.SYS to load with- out the usual status messages, add the  QUIET switch.  Loading DOS into High Memory  DOS enables you to load most of the operating system into an area of extended memory known as the high memory area  HMA , the first 64KB of extended memory  except the first 16 bytes, which overlap the upper memory area . After the device driver HIMEM.SYS is loaded into the computer’s memory, the command DOS=HIGH in CONFIG.SYS loads DOS into high memory.  The next time you boot the computer, DOS uses about 14KB of space in conventional memory and loads the remainder of the operating system into the HMA. If, however, you don’t use this command in CONFIG.SYS or don’t have extended memory installed in your   Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  449  computer, DOS occupies more than 62KB of memory. By loading the operating system into high memory, DOS 6.2 can free about 47KB of conventional memory.  Using Expanded Memory and EMM386.EXE  Because expanded memory was introduced before extended memory, many PC applications were written to take advantage of expanded memory, not extended memory. Today, however, extended memory is far less expensive and much more common. The DOS device driver EMM386.EXE enables applications to use extended memory as though it were expanded memo- ry, freeing you from the need for the special memory boards and device drivers that expand- ed memory requires. Thus, EMM386.EXE emulates expanded memory by using extended memory.  The device driver HIMEM.SYS, discussed earlier, must be loaded before EMM386.EXE. HIMEM.SYS makes extended memory available, and EMM386.EXE enables you to use some or all extended memory as though it were expanded memory. Do not use EMM386.EXE if you are using another driver from a third-party software vendor as an expanded memory manager.  Some applications today can use either expanded memory or extended memory by accessing whichever is available. If you have a choice, use extended memory, which is faster.  In addition to its role as an expanded memory emulator, EMM386.EXE also is a UMB provider, working with HIMEM.SYS to provide upper memory blocks  UMBs  into which you can load device drivers and memory-resident programs. See the next section, “Loading Device Drivers and TSRs into Upper Memory,” for further discussion of providing UMBs.  The syntax of the command for EMM386.EXE, used as a device driver, is shown in the  following: DEVICE=EMM386.EXE ONOFFAUTO memory W=ONOFF  Part IV Ch 19  MxFRAME=address  Pmmmm Pn=address X=mmmm-nnn I=mmmm-nnn B=address L=minxms A=altregs H=handles D=nnn RAM NOEMS MIN=n  VERBOSE ROM=mmmm-nnnn NOVCPI  WIN=mmmm-nnnn NOMOVEXBDA NOHIGHSCAN ALTBOOT NOHI  In most cases, one of the following commands is sufficient: DEVICE=EMM386.EXE RAM  DEVICE=EMM386.EXE NOEMS  The first command loads the expanded memory emulator and allocates 256KB of extended memory to be used as expanded memory. The RAM switch enables upper memory. The sec- ond command also enables upper memory but tells EMM386 not to allocate extended mem- ory for use as expanded memory.  Sometimes you might need the remaining switches for the EMM386.EXE device driver to cus- tomize your computer for use with particularly demanding software or hardware. You can specify ON, OFF, or AUTO in the EMM386.EXE device driver command to indicate whether your   450  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  computer starts in the EMM386.EXE active, inactive, or automatic mode, respectively. By default, the device driver is active, and EMM386.EXE makes extended memory available. However, some applications might not run properly when EMM386.EXE is active because EMM386.EXE places the computer in a mode known as Virtual 8086 mode. When you use EMM386.EXE as a device driver, the driver loads in memory and remains active  ON  unless you specify otherwise by using the OFF switch.  The OFF switch starts the computer with EMM386.EXE loaded in memory but inactive. The XMS memory allocated as EMS memory is unavailable for any purpose. You can activate the driver by entering the following command at the DOS command prompt: EMM386 ON  The OFF switch is not compatible, however, with the RAM or NOEMS switches, discussed later in this section.  Use AUTO if you want EMM386.EXE to activate only when an application requests EMS memo- ry. This setting provides maximum compatibility with software that might not work proper- ly in Virtual 8086 mode. Like the OFF switch, AUTO is not compatible with the RAM or NOEMS switches.  Even though EMM386.EXE activates when an application requests EMS memory, the driver does not automatically deactivate when the application terminates. To turn off the driver, you must issue the following command at the command prompt: EMM386 OFF  The memory parameter enables you to specify the amount of XMS memory you want EMM386.EXE to allocate as EMS memory. Type the number of kilobytes in the range from 16 to 32,768. EMM386.EXE rounds any number you type down to the nearest multiple of 16. All unallocated memory remains available as XMS memory. The default EMS memory allocat- ed is 256KB.  As a general rule, allocate only as much EMS memory as is required by your applications. Any memory allocated as EMS memory is no longer available as XMS memory. Most of the newer DOS applications, especially games, require the maximum amount of XMS you can make available. If none of your applications need expanded memory, use the NOEMS option so that no memory is allocated as expanded memory.  Use the L=minxms switch, in which minxms is the number of kilobytes, to indicate the mini- mum XMS memory that EMM386.EXE is to allocate. This parameter overrides the memory parameter.  If you installed a Weitek math coprocessor chip—a special computer chip that improves  the performance of computation-intensive software, such as computer-aided design  CAD  software—use the W=ON switch. By default, the device driver does not support this type of   Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  451  coprocessor. You also can turn on or off support for the Weitek coprocessor by entering one of the following commands at the DOS prompt: EMM386 W=ON  EMM386 W=OFF  In some circumstances, you might want to use upper memory for device drivers and memory- resident programs, but you don’t need EMS memory. In this case, use the NOEMS switch with the EMM386.EXE driver to free the maximum amount of upper memory and to provide no EMS memory. You might intend to run Windows 3.1 on your computer, for example. Because Windows can use all your XMS memory, this software doesn’t need EMS memory.  The  VERBOSE switch causes EMM386 to print status and error messages when it loads. Normally, EMM386 suppresses these messages. You can abbreviate  VERBOSE as  V.  EMM386 scans the upper memory area  UMA  for all available free memory. Unusual archi- tectures might confuse EMM386, causing trouble when your computer boots or while you use the computer. The NOHIGHSCAN parameter limits EMM386’s scanning of the UMA. If you expe- rience problems when you use EMM386, adding the NOHIGHSCAN parameter might solve the problem.  EMM386 loads part of itself into the upper memory area. If one of your programs needs extra upper memory blocks, and you’re willing to give up some of your conventional memory, the NOHI parameter causes EMM386 to load all of itself into conventional memory, and does not use any UMA.  The remaining switches available for use with EMM386.EXE are highly technical and beyond the scope of this book. Refer to your DOS User’s Guide or the Technical Reference manual for more information.  Loading Device Drivers and TSRs into Upper Memory  In addition to enabling you to run DOS in high memory, DOS provides the capability of loading memory-resident programs and device drivers into upper memory blocks, freeing more conventional memory for other applications. DOS can access this area of memory in 80386 and 80486 PCs  including SXs  that have 1MB or more of memory.  To load device drivers or memory-resident programs, also called terminate-and-stay-resident  TSR  programs, into upper memory, the following conditions must be met:    Your computer has an 80386 or better CPU.   HIMEM.SYS is loaded as a device driver.   EMM386.EXE is loaded as a device driver with the RAM or NOEMS switch.   The command DOS=UMB appears in the CONFIG.SYS file.  If you also want to use the command DOS=HIGH to load DOS into high memory, you can combine the two commands as shown in the following: DOS=HIGH, UMB  Part IV Ch 19   452  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  You can load two types of programs into upper memory: device drivers and memory- resident programs  TSRs . You already know that device drivers normally are loaded using the DEVICE command. When you want to load a device driver into upper memory, however, you use the DEVICEHIGH command. The syntax for this configuration command is as follows: DEVICEHIGH=filename.ext  switches  The switches in the syntax for the preceding command are any switches you use for the file that you are loading, not for the DEVICEHIGH command itself.  To load into upper memory the screen driver ANSI.SYS, for example, you need the following command in CONFIG.SYS: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS  When you boot the computer, DOS attempts to load ANSI.SYS into the upper memory area.  DEVICEHIGH and LOADHIGH recognize two switches:  L and  S. When you use MemMaker to automatically configure your PC, it might use these switches in the com- mands it generates. These switches are not intended for use by users.  To load a memory-resident program into upper memory, precede the program’s startup command with LOADHIGH.  You can use the abbreviation LH in place of LOADHIGH.  The syntax for the command for LOADHIGH is as follows: LOADHIGH programname  switches  As an example, assume that you want to load DOSKEY  discussed in Chapter 18, “Mastering DOSKEY and Macros”  into upper memory each time you start your computer. To do so, you add the following command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file: LOADHIGH DOSKEY  The next time you reboot the computer, DOS attempts to load DOSKEY into upper mem- ory. DOS does not load a program into upper memory if the program requests that DOS allocate more memory during initialization than is available in the largest available upper memory block. If DOS is not successful when it tries to load device drivers or TSRs into the upper memory area, it loads the program into conventional memory instead.  Use the MEM command to determine whether a driver or program has loaded into upper memory.   Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  453  Displaying the Amount of Free and Used Memory  So that you can make the most efficient use of DOS’s memory management utilities, DOS also enables you to display the amount of free and used memory at any point during a DOS session. Use the MEM command for this purpose.  The syntax for the MEM command is as follows: MEM  CLASSIFY  DEBUG  FREE  MODULE modulename  PAGE  Most of these options   DEBUG,  FREE, and  MODULE  are primarily of interest to programmers. For any option, you can specify just the first letter, such as  C in place of  CLASSIFY, for example.  With no switches, MEM gives a basic report of how the memory on your machine is being used. The following provides a sample of a basic MEM report from a typical computer with 8MB of memory: Memory Type        Total  =   Used  +   Free -------------      ------     -----    ------ Conventional         640K       79K      562K Upper                 71K       33K       38K Reserved             384K      384K        0K Extended  XMS *    7,097K    2,537K    4,560K -------------      ------    ------    ------ Total memory       8,192K    3,033K    5,159K  Total under 1 MB     711K      112K      599K  Total Expanded  EMS                 7,488K  7,667,712 bytes  Free Expanded  EMS *                4,800K  4,915,200 bytes   * EMM386 is using XMS memory to simulate EMS memory as needed.  Free EMS memory may change as free XMS memory changes.  Largest executable program size       561K  574,752 bytes  Largest free upper memory block        22K   22,016 bytes  MS-DOS is resident in the high memory area.  Even this most basic report includes a wealth of information:    This computer has 640KB of conventional memory, of which 79KB is currently in use,  leaving 562KB free.    This computer loaded EMM386, which found 71KB available in upper memory blocks;  33KB of the 71KB is currently in use.    This computer has 7,097KB of extended memory, 2,537KB of which is in use.   The computer has 599KB of memory available below 1MB, representing the memory  available for loading programs and device drivers on this machine.    The largest program you can load into conventional memory is 561KB.   The largest free upper memory block is 22KB. Consequently, you cannot load “high”  any program or device driver that requires more memory than 22KB.  Part IV Ch 19   454  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer    Most of DOS has been loaded into the high memory area because the command  DOS=HIGH appeared in the CONFIG.SYS file.  With the  CLASSIFY switch, MEM lists all DOS programs and device drivers currently loaded. Along with the information shown previously, MEM lists this additional information if you use  CLASSIFY: Modules using memory below 1 MB:  Name           Total       =   Conventional   +   Upper Memory --------   ---------------    ---------------     -------------- MSDOS       18,029    18K      18,029    18K           0     0K  HIMEM        1,168     1K       1,168     1K           0     0K  EMM386       3,120     3K       3,120     3K           0     0K  DBLSPACE    37,664    37K      37,664    37K           0     0K  COMMAND      3,184     3K       3,184     3K           0     0K  MOUSE       17,088    17K      17,088    17K           0     0K  SETVER         816     1K           0     0K         816     1K  ANSI         4,240     4K           0     0K       4,240     4K  SMARTDRV    29,024    28K           0     0K      29,024    28K  Free       613,472   599K     574,976   562K      38,496    38K   This sample report shows the programs and device drivers currently loaded and displays the amount of conventional and upper memory used by each:    MSDOS is the portion of MS-DOS that did not get loaded into the high memory area.   HIMEM is the HIMEM.SYS device driver.   EMM386 is the EMM386.EXE device driver.   DBLSPACE is the DoubleSpace device driver.   COMMAND is the DOS command interpreter.   MOUSE is the mouse device driver.   SETVER is the device driver used to modify how DOS reports version information.   ANSI is the ANSI.SYS device driver, which this computer loads.   SMARTDRV is the device driver for caching information going to and from disk drives.  MEM  C often displays more than a screenful of information. The  P option tells MEM to pause after each screenful of data and wait for you to press a key before continuing.  After you identify a driver or memory-resident program that appears to be the right size to fit in the available UMB, edit CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT to add DEVICEHIGH or LOADHIGH to the appropriate command. Reboot your computer and issue the MEM  C command again to see whether the driver or program loaded.  Arriving at the optimal combination of device drivers and memory-resident programs loaded into upper memory might require some experimentation. DOS loads programs in the largest available UMB first, so try loading the largest drivers and programs first by    Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  455  placing their startup commands earliest in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT. To alleviate some of the trial-and-error necessary in arriving at the optimal memory arrangement, DOS now provides the MemMaker utility, which is described in the following section.  Configuring Memory with MemMaker  Understanding and configuring a PC’s memory is one of the most challenging activities most users face. Because most users usually configure their computer’s memory once, they never really get a chance to build any experience fiddling with the configuration. After sev- eral years of watching users stumble at configuring their PCs, Microsoft finally offered help. DOS includes MemMaker, a utility that analyzes your PC and makes the appropriate changes to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files so that your computer uses its memory most effectively.  Some people use Windows or a particular application so often that they add a command to the end of their AUTOEXEC.BAT file to start the application automatically every time they boot. If you have added such a command that takes you automatically into Windows or any other program, read this warning carefully. If, on the other hand, you find yourself at the DOS prompt when your computer boots, you can skip this warning.  MemMaker does its work in three phases, and between each phase it reboots your com- puter. Each time MemMaker causes your computer to reboot, your AUTOEXEC.BAT file starts your application as usual, preventing MemMaker from continuing its work. You must exit these programs for MemMaker to perform the next phase.  You can take Understanding  two different paths to configure your memory with MemMaker. One is to follow the Express Setup. The other path you can choose is the Custom Setup.  Express Setup is the easier path to choose. You have little interaction with Express Setup, other than pressing Enter when MemMaker prompts you to do so. MemMaker searches through the upper memory area to find open memory addresses. It then sorts device drivers and TSRs that you load in memory to see the optimum loading order. Finally, it updates your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for two reasons. MemMaker ensures that HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE load to manage memory and that the DOS=UMB directive is in CONFIG.SYS to provide the link to upper memory blocks. In addition, MemMaker inserts DEVICEHIGH and LOADHIGH before the device drivers and TSRs that load in upper memory.  Part IV Ch 19  Although MemMaker adds the device drivers HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE and the upper memory block directive HIGH=UMB, it does not ensure that DOS loads into upper memory with the directive DOS=HIGH. Before you use MemMaker, ensure that your system loads DOS in the high memory area by inserting DOS=HIGH in your CONFIG.SYS file and rebooting your computer. After you are running DOS in the high memory area  the MEM command tells you that DOS is in the high memory area , run MemMaker.   456  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  If you start an application such as Windows from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, place the word REM in front of the startup command  in this case, in front of WIN  before using MemMaker. REM causes DOS to ignore the rest of the command so that you don’t have to exit your application during each MemMaker phase. When MemMaker has completed its work, remove REM so that your application again starts automatically each time you boot.  An easy way to run MemMaker is to use the  BATCH switch. From the command line, type MEMMAKER  BATCH. This command runs MemMaker in automatic mode, accepting all the default answers.  Custom Setup is similar to Express Setup in that it scans the upper memory area for open address space, sorts device drivers and TSRs for optimal order, and updates your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. As you might expect, however, you can customize how MemMaker performs these tasks. The following list shows the elements you can customize using Custom Setup:    Specify any TSRs that are not to be included in optimization.   Aggressively scan the upper memory area.   Set aside upper memory for Windows use.   Use an area of upper memory set aside for the Monochrome Display Adapter  MDA  if  you are using only an EGA or VGA display  but not SuperVGA .    Keep any special memory inclusions or exclusions that you specified with EMM386.EXE.   Move the Extended BIOS data area in upper memory blocks.  Now that you understand what MemMaker can do to optimize your computer’s memory, you are ready to use MemMaker. The following two sections explain how to use MemMaker with Express Setup and Custom Setup.  Using Express Setup Follow these steps to run MemMaker using Express Setup:  1. At the DOS prompt, type MEMMAKER and press Enter. 2. MemMaker asks whether you want to continue. Press Enter to continue. 3. MemMaker asks whether you want Express or Custom Setup, as shown in Figure 19.1. For most users, an Express Setup does an excellent job. Unless you are very knowledge- able about PCs and want to guide MemMaker’s every step, press Enter to select an Express Setup.   Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  457  Figure 19.1 From this screen, you select the type of setup to be per- formed.  Figure 19.2 On this screen, you specify use of expand- ed memory in your system.  Figure 19.3 If your system does not reboot automati- cally, you can turn your computer off and then back on.  4. MemMaker asks whether you intend to use EMS  expanded  memory, as shown in  Figure 19.2. Answer Y or N, and press Enter.  If the answer you want is already showing, just press Enter.   5. When you see a screen indicating that MemMaker must reboot the computer, as shown  in Figure 19.3, press Enter to reboot.  If your computer does not start correctly, turn- ing it off and back on reboots it.   Part IV Ch 19  6. When your computer reboots, MemMaker automatically begins the next phase of its work, telling you that it has calculated the optimal configuration for your computer. MemMaker displays another screen, as shown in Figure 19.4, that asks you to press Enter so that MemMaker can reboot again. Press Enter to continue.   458  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  Figure 19.4 After this reboot, your new memory configu- ration is complete.  7. During the reboot, your computer executes the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files that  MemMaker created. Although MemMaker should do an excellent job of configuring your computer for peak performance, there is always a chance that it can make a mis- take. As your computer boots, watch carefully for any errors produced by the device drivers and programs that you load from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. After your computer completes its reboot, MemMaker begins its last phase. MemMaker displays the message shown in Figure 19.5, asking whether you saw any errors during boot. If your computer booted without errors, press Enter.  Figure 19.5 Observe your boot process to see whether it appears normal; if it does, MemMaker is fin- ished.  8. MemMaker displays a table showing how the changes affected your available memory.  A sample is shown in Figure 19.6. This report tells you how much of each type of memory you had available before and after MemMaker made its changes. In this exam- ple, MemMaker adjusts commands in AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS so that several device drivers and TSR programs are loaded into upper memory, freeing up about 114KB of conventional memory. MemMaker also tells you that it has saved your origi- nal AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files as AUTOEXEC.UMB and CONFIG.UMB in case you later discover a problem and want to return to using your original files.  After running MemMaker, if you experience problems with any of your programs that you did not have before, issue the MEMMAKER  UNDO command to remove any changes that MemMaker made.   Optimizing Your Computer’s Memory  459  Figure 19.6 In this summary report from MemMaker, the third column indicates how much conventional memory you have saved.  9. When you finish examining this report, press Enter to exit MemMaker.  Using Custom Setup Follow these steps to run MemMaker using Custom Setup:  1. At the DOS Prompt, type MEMMAKER and press Enter. 2. MemMaker asks whether you want to continue. Press Enter. 3. MemMaker asks whether you want Express or Custom Setup  refer to Figure 19.1 .  Press the spacebar to select Custom Setup and then press Enter to continue.  4. MemMaker asks whether you intend to use EMS memory  refer to Figure 19.2 . Press  the spacebar to choose Yes or No. After you have made the desired selection, press Enter.  5. MemMaker now displays Advanced Options that enable you to customize the settings  used when optimizing memory. Each advanced option requires a Yes or No answer. Use the spacebar to answer. Use the down- and up-arrow keys to move from one option to the next. The following list explains the options that you have to set:        Specify which drivers and TSRs to include in optimization? Answering Yes enables you to leave out of optimization TSRs that must be loaded into memory in a specific sequence or that give MemMaker trouble during optimization. Scan the upper memory area aggressively? If you answer Yes, MemMaker includes the HIGHSCAN parameter in the EMM386.EXE line of CONFIG.SYS. Although EMM386.EXE normally scans the address range C600-EFFF for available upper memory, adding HIGHSCAN instructs EMM386.EXE to scan the address range C600- F7FF.    Optimize upper memory for use with Windows? If you answer Yes,  EMM386.EXE sets aside upper memory for use by Windows. This provides more memory for DOS programs that you run from Windows. If you do not run DOS programs from Windows, choose No.  Part IV Ch 19   460  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer    Use monochrome region  B000-BFFF  for running programs? Answer Yes if you have installed an EGA or VGA display adapter but not a monochrome or SuperVGA display adapter. The address range B000-BFFF can be used as upper memory if you have an EGA or VGA display adapter installed.    Keep current EMM386 memory exclusions and inclusions? If you currently are using EMM386.EXE and have specific addresses specified to include or exclude, answer Yes to this question.    Move Extended BIOS Data Area from conventional to upper memory? Normally, EMM386.EXE moves the Extended Bios Data Area  EBDA  to upper memory. If any unusual problems occur while you’re running MemMaker, how- ever, answer No to this option.  6. After you answer all the Advanced Options correctly, press Enter to continue with  MemMaker.  7. MemMaker searches your hard disk for a copy of Windows. If it finds Windows,  MemMaker displays the directory in which the copy of Windows resides. If this direc- tory is incorrect, type the correct directory. Press Enter to continue.  From this point, MemMaker behaves exactly as in the Express Setup. Refer to the previous section, picking up with step 5.  Providing Memory for Your Applications  One of the most frustrating problems to encounter using DOS is trying to run a program and discovering that you do not have enough memory available.  If you are trying to run a new application and encounter this problem, you can take some steps to try to resolve it:    Your CONFIG.SYS file loads HIMEM.SYS first and then EMM386.EXE. Together, these two dri-  vers allow access to extended memory and upper memory blocks.    Unless you are running applications that need expanded memory, use the NOEMS option  for EMM386.EXE so that all extended memory is available as XMS memory.    Load DOS into the high memory area and make upper memory available to DOS by  entering the command DOS=HIGH,UMB.    Use the DEVICEHIGH command for as many drivers as possible in your CONFIG.SYS file.  You cannot use DEVICEHIGH for HIMEM.SYS or EMM386.EXE, and some other device drivers might not load properly with DEVICEHIGH. Experiment and use MEM C to determine whether the drivers loaded properly.    Use LOADHIGH for any TSRs you load in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Because some TSRs  might not work correctly when loaded high, experiment until you determine what TSR you can load high.   Increasing Hard Disk Performance  461    If you own a 386 computer or better, your CONFIG.SYS file begins with the following:  DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS DOS=HIGH,UMB  Using the MEM command is very important in this case to see how much memory is available for programs. Another point to keep in mind is that you need to avoid loading any drivers that are unnecessary. If the application you are trying to run does not require sound, for example, and you have a sound card, try not loading the sound drivers.  One useful trick is to make multiple start configurations for different uses. If you have a game that requires a lot of memory, for example, and the only way to get it to run is not to load your tape drive driver, make a new startup configuration for it and use the DOS menu function.  To find out more details about creating multiple configurations, refer to Chapter 2,  “Starting DOS.”  Increasing Hard Disk Performance  If your computer is typical, it spends a lot of its time accessing data and programs on hard disk. Speeding up your hard disk is probably the single most significant change you can make to increase the overall speed of your system. Although most later systems have a fast, IDE-based hard drive, you can configure DOS to make the most of it.  The BUFFERS command in CONFIG.SYS tells DOS how much memory to reserve for file transfers. DOS sets aside an area of RAM called a buffer for temporary storage of data being transferred between the disk and an application.  When DOS is asked to retrieve information from a disk, it reads the information in incre- ments of whole sectors  512 bytes . Excess data not required from that sector is left in the buffer. If this data is needed later, DOS does not need to perform another disk access to retrieve the data. Similarly, DOS tries to reduce disk activity when it writes information to the disk. If less than a full sector is to be written to the disk, DOS accumulates the informa- tion in a disk buffer. When the buffer is full, DOS writes the information to the disk. This action is called flushing the buffer. To make sure that all pertinent information is placed into  a file, DOS also flushes the buffers when a program closes a disk file.  Whenever a disk buffer is used, DOS marks it to indicate that it has been used recently. When DOS needs to reuse buffers for new information, it takes the buffer that has not been used for the longest time.  The net effect of DOS’s use of buffers is to reduce the number of disk accesses by reading and writing only full sectors. By reusing the least-recently used buffers, DOS retains infor- mation more likely to be needed next. Your programs and, therefore, DOS run faster.  Part IV Ch 19   462  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  You can control the number of buffers available for DOS to use. Each buffer uses up some of your memory but results in faster disk access. The syntax for the BUFFERS command is shown in the following: BUFFERS = n, m  The n parameter is the number of disk buffers you want DOS to allocate. A single buffer is about 512 bytes long  plus 16 bytes used by DOS . Use a number from 1 to 99. If you do not give the BUFFERS command, DOS uses a default value between 2 and 15, depending on the size of your disk drives, the amount of memory in your system, and the version of DOS you are using. Table 19.3 lists the different default buffer configurations.  Table 19.3 Default Number of Disk Buffers  Buffers 2  3  5  10  15  Hardware 360KB floppy disk drive  Any other hard or floppy disk drive  More than 128KB of RAM  More than 256KB of RAM  More than 512KB of RAM  The m parameter is a number in the range 1 through 8 that specifies the number of sectors DOS reads each time it is instructed to read a file. This feature is sometimes called a sec- ondary cache or a look-ahead buffer. When files most often are read sequentially, this type of buffer increases performance. Do not use this secondary cache feature if you are using or plan to use a disk caching program such as SMARTDRV.SYS., discussed in Chapter 7, “Preparing and Maintaining Disks.”  Increasing the number of buffers generally improves disk performance, up to a point. The recommended number of buffers increases with the size of your hard disk. Consider the sug- gested buffer numbers listed in Table 19.4 when adding a BUFFERS command to CONFIG.EXE. Using a number higher than the recommended number of buffers probably uses more mem- ory without further improving speed.  Table 19.4  Suggested Number of Disk Buffers  Hard Disk Size Less than 40MB  40MB to 79MB  80MB to 119MB  120MB or more  Buffers 20  30  40  50   Fine-Tuning Your Computer with CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT  463  If you have an 85MB hard disk and are not using a hard disk caching program, for example, you might include the following BUFFERS command in CONFIG.SYS: BUFFERS=40,8  Fine-Tuning Your Computer with CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT  In addition to the commands covered earlier in this chapter, you can use many other com- mands in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT to customize your computer configuration. The fol- lowing sections discuss other useful commands: FCBS, FILES, LASTDRIVE, SHELL, INSTALL, REM, and SWITCHES.  Accessing Files through FCBS  The FCBS configuration command enables you to use programs written for DOS 1.1; some DOS users find FCBs indispensable. FCB is an acronym for file control block. FCBs serve as one way a program can access a file. This method of file access was used by DOS 1.1 to communicate with programs. Later versions of DOS borrow a Unix-like method for con- trolling files, called handles  discussed in “Using the FILES Command” in this chapter . Although FCBs can be used with any version of DOS, only DOS 2.0 and higher can use handles.  The syntax for the FCBS command in the CONFIG.SYS file is as follows: FCBS = maxopen  The maxopen parameter is a number between 1 and 255 that sets the maximum number of unique FCBs that programs can open at one time. The default number is four. You don’t need to use this command in CONFIG.SYS unless you have a program that was designed to work with DOS 1.1 and the program cannot open all the required files  a message to this effect appears . In this case, use the FCBS command to increase the number of FCBs that can be open at one time.  Part IV Ch 19  You pay a small price in RAM to use the FCBS command. For each number greater than four that maxopen exceeds, DOS uses about 40 bytes.  Using the FILES Command  FILES is the configuration command used in DOS 2.0 and higher to allow for Unix-like file handling. Unix and later versions of DOS use a file handle  a number corresponding to the filename  instead of file control blocks to access files. You never have to deal with file han- dles directly. Each application program gives the operating system the name of the file or device you want to use. The operating system gives the program a handle, and the program uses that handle to manipulate the file or device.  To include the FILES command in CONFIG.SYS, use the following syntax: FILES = n   464  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  The n parameter is a number  8, which is the default, through 255  that determines the number of files that can be open at one time during a DOS session. Each additional file beyond eight increases the size of DOS by 39 bytes.  If you do not specify the FILES command, DOS starts with eight file handles and immedi- ately takes five handles for the standard devices, leaving only three handles for your pro- grams. This number is almost never large enough for applications you are likely to run. On most systems, increase the number of handles to 20 or 30.  Many installation programs for full-featured applications edit CONFIG.SYS for you and increase the number of files when necessary to run the software efficiently.  Using LASTDRIVE to Change the Number of Disk Drives  The LASTDRIVE configuration command informs DOS of the maximum number of disk drives on your system. Generally, LASTDRIVE is a command used with networked computers or with the pretender commands  such as SUBST .  If you do not use the LASTDRIVE command, DOS assumes that the last disk drive on your system is one more than the number of physical drives and RAM disks you are using. If your LASTDRIVE command specifies a letter corresponding to fewer drives than the number physi- cally attached to your computer or created as RAM disks, DOS ignores the command. The LASTDRIVE command enables you to tell DOS how many disk drives, real or apparent, are on your system, including network drives and directories  if any  and drives created with the SUBST command.  If you want to use the LASTDRIVE command in CONFIG.SYS, use the following syntax: LASTDRIVE = x  The x parameter is the letter for the last disk drive on your system. The letters A through Z in upper- or lowercase are acceptable.  Using the SHELL Command  The SHELL command was originally implemented to enable programmers to replace the DOS command interpreter  COMMAND.COM  with other command interpreters. The SHELL command is more commonly used, however, to perform the following two functions:    Inform DOS that the command interpreter is in another directory, not in the boot  disk’s root directory.    Expand the size of the environment—an area of RAM that stores named variables used by DOS and applications. Commands such as PATH and PROMPT store their current set- tings as environment variables. To display the contents of the environment, type SET at the command prompt and press Enter.   Fine-Tuning Your Computer with CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT  465  SHELL is a tricky command; use it with caution. If used incorrectly, the SHELL command can lock up your system. Keep a bootable floppy disk handy for restarting your computer in case you run into a problem.  The syntax for the SHELL command is as follows: SHELL = filespec parameters  The filespec parameter is the path and filename of the command processor and should be COMMAND.COM if you are using the standard DOS command processor. The SHELL command doesn’t take any other parameters or switches, but you can add command-line parameters or switches available for use with the command processor. The parameters for COMMAND.COM are explained in the next few paragraphs.  When used from the command line, COMMAND loads a copy of the command processor into memory. A common use of COMMAND is as a parameter of the SHELL command. The syntax for COMMAND is as follows: COMMAND d:path\ device  E:size  P  C string  K:filename  MSG  The d:path\ parameter specifies the disk drive and path that contain the command proces- sor if it is not located in the root directory. Always use this parameter when including  COMMAND in the SHELL configuration command. This parameter has the additional effect of setting an environment variable named COMSPEC, which informs DOS and other programs of the location and name of the current command processor.   E:size is an optional switch that sets the environment space. The size parameter is a num- ber between 160 and 32,768 that denotes the amount of memory reserved for the environ- ment.  If you do not specify a multiple of 16, DOS rounds the size parameter up to the next highest multiple of 16.  By default, DOS reserves 256 bytes for the environment.  The  P switch instructs DOS to load the command processor permanently. Without the  P switch, DOS loads COMMAND.COM only temporarily into memory. When you are using COMMAND with the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS, be sure to use the  P switch.  The  C switch and string parameter work together. This combination causes DOS to load the command processor, execute any command represented by string, and then unload the command processor.  The  MSG switch tells DOS to store all its error messages in memory rather than read them from the disk. This feature can speed operation. More importantly, if you are running a sys- tem that has only floppy disks, you sometimes remove the disk that contains COMMAND.COM from the disk drive. Without the  MSG switch, DOS cannot access error messages contained on disk within the COMMAND.COM file itself. Use this switch only if you are running DOS from floppy disks. You also must use the  P switch any time you use the  MSG switch.  The  K parameter tells DOS to run a program or batch file. Use this switch only when you’re running COMMAND from the DOS prompt and not as part of the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS.  Part IV Ch 19   466  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  The DOS Setup program adds the following command to the default CONFIG.SYS file: SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\  P  This configuration command tells DOS that COMMAND.COM is the command interpreter and that it is located in the \DOS directory on the C drive. The  P switch causes the command interpreter to be loaded permanently, not temporarily, in memory.  The preceding SHELL command enables you to place a copy of COMMAND.COM in C:\DOS and delete the copy in the root directory. This practice helps you maintain a clean root directory and protects COMMAND.COM from being replaced by an older version that might be on a floppy disk you are copying. If you accidentally copy the disk to the root directory, you don’t over- write the current version of COMMAND.COM.  Occasionally, you create such a long PATH command in AUTOEXEC.BAT that you fill the avail- able environment space, causing DOS to display the following message: Out of environment space  If this message appears, use COMMAND with the SHELL command and the  E switch to specify a larger environment space. The following command used in CONFIG.SYS, for example, increases the environment to 384 bytes: SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM  E:384  If you already have a SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS, you can add the  E switch. Combining the two preceding SHELL commands, for example, you can include the following command in CONFIG.SYS: SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\  P  E:384  The SHELL command itself doesn’t use any memory, but by increasing the environment space, you can reduce the amount of free conventional memory by an equal amount. In other words, increasing the environment space from 256 bytes to 384 bytes reduces free memory by 128 bytes.  Using the INSTALL Command  The INSTALL configuration command enables you to load memory-resident programs from within CONFIG.SYS. In versions of DOS before 4.0, you had to load these programs from the DOS prompt or through a batch file, such as AUTOEXEC.BAT. You can save several kilobytes of memory by loading a program from CONFIG.SYS with INSTALL rather than from the com- mand line or a batch file as an executable program. DOS 4.0 and later versions support loading any of the following programs by using INSTALL:    FASTOPEN.EXE    KEYB.COM    NLSFUNC.EXE    SHARE.EXE   Fine-Tuning Your Computer with CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT  467  ➔ For more information about these programs, see Appendix F, “Command Reference,” p. 583.  The following is the syntax for using INSTALL in CONFIG.SYS: INSTALL = filespec parameters  The filespec parameter is the path and filename information of the utility you want to load, whereas parameters specifies any parameters or switches required by the utility you want DOS to load.  You might be able to use INSTALL with some memory-resident non-DOS programs. Do not use INSTALL, however, to load a memory-resident program that uses environment variables or shortcut keys or that uses COMMAND.COM. The program you install with this command must have the extension .COM or .EXE.  Using the REM Command  The REM configuration command is equivalent to the REM batch file command. This com- mand enables you to insert remarks into your CONFIG.SYS file. You can leave notes to your- self  or others  explaining what particular lines do. Such documentation in a CONFIG.SYS file is especially helpful if you use non-DOS device drivers for your hardware. You also can tem- porarily remove a CONFIG.SYS statement by prefacing the statement with a REM command. After you test the new configuration, you can return easily to the old configuration by sim- ply removing the REM command.  The syntax for the REM command is as follows: REM remarks  The remarks parameter can be any string of characters that fits on a single line in the  CONFIG.SYS file.  Using the SWITCHES Command  The SWITCHES configuration command enables you to set any of four options that control how four of DOS’s features operate. The syntax of the SWITCHES command is as follows: SWITCHES =  K  W  N  F  You can specify one or more of these four switches in a single SWITCHES command.  The  K switch turns off the enhanced keyboard functions. This command works like the ANSI.SYS  K switch. Some software cannot work with the enhanced keyboard. Use this com- mand to disable the enhanced keyboard so that the software functions properly. If you use the SWITCHES= K command in CONFIG.SYS and also install ANSI.SYS as a device driver, add the  K switch to the DEVICE=ANSI.SYS line as well.  The  W switch specifies that the WINA20.386 file has been moved to a directory other than the root directory. Use this switch if you moved WINA20.386 to another directory and are using Windows in enhanced mode.  Part IV Ch 19   468  Chapter 19 Configuring Your Computer  Normally, you can use the F5 or F8 keys during the first two seconds of booting to bypass some or all the commands in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT. The  N switch tells DOS to ignore F5 or F8 during boot.  Normally, DOS displays this message at the beginning of the boot process and then pauses for two seconds before continuing: Starting MS-DOS  The  F switch tells DOS to skip the two-second pause.  Telling DOS When to Break  As you already know, Ctrl+Break and Ctrl+C are helpful but not foolproof panic buttons you can use to stop commands. The response to a Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C is not instanta- neous. Although only an “Oh, no” second might pass from the time you press the panic but- ton until DOS responds, you still have time to wonder why DOS takes so long to respond. The reason is that DOS is busy doing other things most of the time and looks for Ctrl+Break only at intervals. You can use the BREAK command in CONFIG.SYS to tell DOS when to check for this key sequence. BREAK does not enable or disable the Break key; the BREAK command only controls when DOS checks for the Break key.  The syntax for the BREAK command can be either of the following: BREAK=ON  BREAK=OFF  The default setting for this command is OFF.  If you use the command BREAK=ON in CONFIG.SYS, DOS checks to see whether you pressed Ctrl+Break whenever a program requests some activity from DOS  performs a DOS func- tion call . If you use the command BREAK=OFF, DOS checks for a Ctrl+Break only when DOS is working with the video display, keyboard, printer, or asynchronous serial adapters  the ports at the back of the computer .  If you use programs that do a great deal of disk accessing but little keyboard or screen work, you might want to set BREAK=ON. This setting enables you to break out of the pro- gram quicker when something goes awry or when you simply want to stop DOS.  Using the DOS Pretender Commands  Because DOS manages disks in a logical rather than a strictly physical way, DOS can pre- tend that a disk’s identity is different from the disk’s name. DOS provides the following three commands that pretend that a disk’s identity has changed:    ASSIGN—Redirects disk operations from one disk to another   JOIN—Attaches an entire disk as a subdirectory to the directory structure of another  disk    SUBST—Makes a directory of a disk appear to commands as a separate disk   Fine-Tuning Your Computer with CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT  469  ➔ For detailed information on these commands, see Chapter 11, “Controlling Your Environment,” p. 293.  Using Other Device Control Commands  DOS provides other commands to control devices and report system information, which are briefly discussed in this section.  ➔ These commands are explained in greater detail in Appendix F, “Command Reference,” beginning on   p. 583. The SET command displays the current environment settings and enables you to make new variable assignments.  The PRINT command enables you to print text files on your printer while you continue to do other PC work. This “background” printing can be a great timesaver if your applications don’t have a similar feature.  The MODE command is a multifaceted device-control command. MODE can establish the height and width of your screen’s lines and characters and control the speed of your serial ports. MODE can redirect the output from a parallel printer port to a serial port. You also can use MODE in association with code-page support for international character sets on the PC. You might want to browse through the MODE section of the “Command Reference.  Part IV Ch 19    CHAPTER  20  Networking DOS In this chapter  Common Networks for DOS-Based Computers 472  Learning Preinstallation Items 472  Installing the Novell NetWare Client Software 473  Installing the Microsoft Network Client 478  Using the Network 481  Project: Network Client Setup Tips 482   472  Chapter 20 Networking DOS  Common Networks for DOS-Based Computers You might commonly connect a DOS-based computer to two different networks: Novell NetWare and Microsoft Windows NT Server. Both network operating systems  NOSs  pro- vide client software for DOS that enables you to participate in many of the services offered by both networks, such as file sharing, printer sharing, network security for stored files, and so forth. Installing the client software for each network operating system is relatively straightforward. In this chapter, you learn about installing both the NetWare and Microsoft clients.  Learning Preinstallation Items  Before installing either NOS client, you need to perform a few steps. Primarily, they consist of installing an appropriate network card into the PC and making sure that you have the appropriate DOS driver program for that network card for the NOS client you are installing.  Network cards come in many different varieties. You need to have one that is compatible with the following:    The computer you are installing it in. It should fit in an available slot  ISA, EISA, MCA, or PCI , and should be selectable to an available combination of IRQ, memory port address, and  sometimes  DMA channels. See Chapter 12, “Using Peripherals,” for more information on these subjects.    The network client you are installing. Often, NetWare and Microsoft clients have  separate driver files. To make things trickier, both companies offer different versions of their client software, and the driver must be compatible with the client you are using. For example, Novell has supplied both ODI and VLM clients, whereas Microsoft has supplied both LanManager and Windows NT clients. If in doubt, check the NOS com- pany’s Web site for a list of compatible hardware.    The network type you have. Cards are available for Ethernet, Token Ring, and  ARCnet, and you need one compatible with the type of network you are accessing.    The cabling type you use. All the different network types can use different types of  cabling, and network cards might not have all the available choices built into them. For instance, Ethernet can be cabled with 10BASE-5 cable  Thick Ethernet , 10BASE-2 cable  Thin Ethernet , or Category 3 or 5 twisted-pair cable  10BASE-T and 10BASE- 100 . Although adapters might be available to make a particular card work with a dis- similar network, it is better to have a card that supports the network cabling directly.    What frame type the network uses. For example, Ethernet networks might use  802.2, 802.3, Ethernet SNAP, or Ethernet II frame types.  You also need to know some details about the network server you are connecting to. You need to know answers to the following questions:   Installing the Novell NetWare Client Software  473    What protocol is the server using? Novell networks predominantly use IPX SPX but  sometimes can use TCP IP. Microsoft networks might use NetBEUI, TCP IP, IPX SPX, or any combination thereof.    If you are using TCP IP, you need to know a host of additional information:    The IP address you are to use for the machine   The IP mask you are to use for the machine   At least one DNS server address you can use  two are better, but only one is  required   if one exists  network?

Note that even though both usually work, it’s also true that only one might work on any given network, depending on how it was set up.  After collecting all the preceding information, you can proceed to install the network client software and make your initial network connection.  Installing the Novell NetWare Client Software The latest Novell NetWare client for DOS is amazingly large: about 22MB before being installed. It is available on a CD-ROM that comes with the NOS or can be downloaded from Novell’s Web site  in a self-extracting zip file . When you download the compressed file, you then execute the file to extract all the installation files. You can then run the INSTALL program, as follows, to begin the actual installation of the client software:  1. When you begin the installation, you first see a license screen  see Figure 20.1 . If you  agree to the license, press Enter to continue.  Figure 20.1 The Novell license screen.  Part IV Ch 20   474  Chapter 20 Networking DOS  2. You then see a selection screen in which you choose which client options you want  to install. This selection screen is shown in Figure 20.2. The choices are detailed in Table 20.1.  Figure 20.2 The Novell client option selection screen.  Table 20.1 Novell Client Installation Options  Option Novell Client for DOS  Description Required; specifies the basic network software with the IPX SPX protocol  Novell Client Windows Support  Enables additional Windows 3.x support  Novell Distributed Print Services  Provides better print management with Windows 3.x  IP IPX Gateway  Enables Windows 3.x applications to use a Novell Internet gateway  Workstation Manager 3.x  Adds administrative programs  NetBIOS  Desktop SNMP  NetWare TSA for SMS  TCP IP Protocol Stack  NetWare IP  Enables NetBIOS support  Enables support for Simple Network Management Protocol  Installs centralized backup support for the client  Installs support for TCP IP  Installs support for NetWare IP  For this example, Novell Client for DOS and TCP IP Protocol Stack have been cho- sen. After you select the appropriate check boxes, press F10 to proceed.  3. If you selected TCP IP, you are asked specific information about your TCP IP network  configuration. The first question prompts you about any DHCP, BOOTP, or RARP hosts on the network, as shown in Figure 20.3. For this example, it is assumed that these hosts do not exist.   Installing the Novell NetWare Client Software  475  Figure 20.3 Select a configuration host for TCP IP.  Figure 20.4 Enter manual TCP IP information.  4. Assuming you have chosen to enter your TCP IP information manually, provide the IP  address, router address, subnetwork mask, DNS domain name, and DNS addresses to the configuration. Figure 20.4 shows this screen with some sample values entered.  5. You are then prompted for whether you are using a 16- or 32-bit network interface.  You have to check the driver files available for your network card. If they have the LAN file extension, they support a 32-bit interface, whereas if they have a COM or EXE exten- sion, they support only a 16-bit interface.  6. You are shown a list of drivers that are included with the Novell client software, as shown in Figure 20.5. Choose your adapter from the list and press F10 to continue.  Part IV Ch 20   476  Chapter 20 Networking DOS  Figure 20.5 Choose a LAN board.  7. You now choose some additional configuration information for your network and net-  work card. Complete the requested information  check with your network administrator if you don’t have the answers yet to any of the questions because you must supply the correct answers to all the questions so that the network connection can function . Figure 20.6 shows this additional configuration screen.  Figure 20.6 Provide additional configuration informa- tion to the setup pro- gram.  8. After pressing F10, you see the screen shown in Figure 20.7. Here, you choose whether  the installation program is to modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files  it should , the directory into which the client software is to be installed  accept the default , and you have a chance to confirm the network interface type and card type you plan to use.   Installing the Novell NetWare Client Software  477  Figure 20.7 Check the Installation Configuration Summary screen.  9. After you press F10 a final time, the client software is installed into the computer. As  part of this installation, a number of changes take place on the computer’s C: drive, including adding two lines to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. First, the path to the Novell  client is added. Second, a reference to another batch file, called  typically  C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\STARTNET.BAT, is added. The STARTNET.BAT file contains the fol- lowing lines that actually start the network client when the computer is restarted:  SET NWLANGUAGE=ENGLISH C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\NIOS.EXE LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\NBIC32.NLM LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\LSLC32.NLM LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\CMSM.NLM LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\ETHERTSM.NLM LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\3C5X9.LAN FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2 PORT=200 ISA RXEARLY=NO LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\3C5X9.LAN FRAME=ETHERNET_802.3 PORT=200 ISA RXEARLY=NO LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\3C5X9.LAN FRAME=ETHERNET_II PORT=200 ISA RXEARLY=NO LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\3C5X9.LAN FRAME=ETHERNET_SNAP PORT=200 ISA RXEARLY=NO LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\TCPIP.NLM LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\TRANNTA.NLM LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\IPX.NLM LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\SPX_SKTS.NLM LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\CLIENT32.NLM  For TCP IP installations, a file called RESOLVE.CFG is created in the C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\TCP directory; it contains the information about the domain name and DNS server you plan  to use.  After you restart the computer, the Novell client starts, and you can log in to a Novell serv- er normally. At this point, if any difficulties arise, consult with a network administrator for your network.  Part IV Ch 20   478  Chapter 20 Networking DOS  Installing the Microsoft Network Client  Installing the Microsoft network client for MS-DOS is somewhat easier than installing the NetWare client:  1. After you procure the client software  it is available on the Windows NT Server 4.0  CD-ROM or by download from ftp.microsoft.com , extract the component parts into an installation directory. Then, from that directory, use the SETUP program to begin the installation. The introductory screen to the setup program is shown in Figure 20.8.  Figure 20.8 The introductory screen for Microsoft Client Setup.  Figure 20.9 The master setup screen.  2. Press Enter to be prompted for the directory to which you want to install the Microsoft  client. The default is C:\NET. Accept the default and press Enter to continue.  3. You are now prompted for your username on the network. You should have acquired  this information from your network administrator. Enter the correct username and press Enter.  4. You now see the master setup screen, as shown in Figure 20.9. Here, you can change  your username, change setup options, and set important protocol information.   Installing the Microsoft Network Client  479  5. Choose Change Setup Options to see the screen shown in Figure 20.10. You can then  set the following options:    Change Redir Options—Do you use basic or full redirector? The basic redi-  rector supports most functions and uses less memory than the full redirector but cannot log in to a Windows NT domain. Usually, you have to use the full redi- rector.    Change Startup Options—You can load the redirector, load the redirector and  pop-up, or not load anything. This setting controls which features are started automatically when you boot the computer. Choosing to automatically load the pop-up consumes an additional 29KB of conventional memory but provides you with more network information than otherwise. Usually, you should just choose Load Network Client.    Change Logon Validation—If your network uses a domain security model, you  need to change this option so that you can log in to the domain.    Change Net Pop Hot Key—Allows you to specify which key to use with  Ctrl+Alt to view the pop-up interface.  Figure 20.10 You can modify setup options for the Microsoft Network Client during installa- tion using the Change Setup Options screen.  6. Choose the Change Network Configuration option from the master setup screen; you  see the screen shown in Figure 20.11. The Change Network Configuration screen is complex and has many possible layers, depending on what networking options you need  and rarely do you need just the default options .  Part IV Ch 20   480  Chapter 20 Networking DOS  Figure 20.11 The Change Network Configuration screen allows you to make advanced changes  to how your client accesses the network.  7. The good news is that the installation program detects  if it can  your network card and displays its choice, along with a default protocol selection. If either is incorrect, you can change it by choosing the Change Settings option or the Remove and Add Protocol options. You can also use the Tab key to move between the two boxes and can then choose a different option to change. For example, you can tab to the top box and then choose the IPX SPX protocol to change any options there. When you choose Change Settings for the network card, you see the detailed settings for your network card, as shown in Figure 20.12. You can select the appropriate IRQ, DMA, and other options for your network card.  You might need to run the setup program for the card itself to get some of these values; you need to do so before you install the network client, if  possible.   Figure 20.12 You can modify your network card hard- ware and protocol settings during setup.   Using the Network  481  8. If you want to use TCP IP, use the Add Protocol option and then choose TCP IP from  the following screen. After you return to the Change Network Configuration screen, you can choose the TCP IP protocol from the list and change its settings. Here, you can set your IP address, subnet mask, and other TCP IP options gathered at the begin- ning of this chapter  see Figure 20.13 .  Figure 20.13 You must enter your TCP IP address set- tings to use the TCP IP protocol.  9. After you add the necessary protocols and set all options, choose The Listed Options  Are Correct to return to the master setup screen. From there, choose The Listed Options Are Correct to begin the installation, which proceeds without further input from you.  At the completion of the installation, you need to restart the computer to load the appropri- ate drivers and access the network.  Using the Network  After you have installed the appropriate DOS client software for your network, you can proceed to use the network. Using the network can be a complex topic; it includes a num- ber of different commands and utilities all unique to the network you are using. For Novell networks, peruse the user manuals that came with the NOS. You will use commands such as LOGIN, MAP, NPRINT, and FILER to accomplish many network tasks, although you should be sure to review the complete list because you might find many commands useful.  For Microsoft networks, you can accomplish most tasks by using the NET command, which is a sort of hydra  multiheaded  command that can do many different things, from logging you in to the network to mapping network drives to assigning file permissions to others. Typing NET ? gets you started with these commands  although you need to read the docu- mentation on using the NET command for proper details .  Part IV Ch 20   482  Chapter 20 Networking DOS  Project: Network Client Setup Tips  Setting up a DOS network client can be difficult if you’re not the network administrator and are trying to reinvent the wheel. To make the job go smoothly, make sure you find out any information specific to your network from the network administrator or person who set up the network. If that doesn’t work and you’re having trouble connecting to the network, you can “dissect” another user’s functioning network connection to see what settings might be wrong on your system. Looking at a working computer’s setup can be an invaluable aid in quickly spotting the problem with your own connection.  If, for some reason, the preceding two resources don’t help you find a quick answer to your connection problem, try the following tips:    Make sure that the network interface card  NIC  is functioning. Most NICs come with diagnostic software that can perform basic tests. Often, you also can run more compre- hensive diagnostic software that sends data between the computer being tested and another running the diagnostic software to confirm that it is fully functioning.    If you’re having a problem with the NIC working properly, the problem is almost cer- tainly the result of a conflict with another device. Chapter 12 provides information on resolving device conflicts.    Make sure that you have the correct protocol chosen for your network. For Ethernet networks, make sure you’ve also chosen the correct frame type, which is 802.3, 802.2, Ethernet II, or Ethernet SNAP.    If your network uses TCP IP, make sure that you have the correct addresses for your TCP IP configuration. Also, make sure that you’re using a unique address that is not conflicting with another computer.  You might have to rely on a network administrator to help ensure this address because all networks track these things differently.     For Novell network clients, watch carefully as the different programs that make up the client load on the screen after the computer is booted. Often, you can see an error mes- sage  it might be fleeting  that leads you to the solution.    Try removing the network startup commands from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Boot the sys- tem without them and then issue those same commands manually at the DOS prompt. This approach enables you to see error messages or problems more clearly.  The nice thing about networks is that you usually have to solve problems only once, and you then can apply that knowledge to successive installations of the client software. For this reason, I can’t emphasize strongly enough that your first course of action if a network client installation isn’t working right is to talk to people who have made it work properly and to the administrator of the system who probably will be familiar with whatever problem you are having. In most networks, after the bugs are worked out with a sample client installation or two  or three! , getting the remaining systems up and running then becomes easy.   CHAPTER  21  Connecting to the Internet In this chapter  Internet Connection Options for DOS-Based Computers 484  Connecting to Your ISP 484  Using Internet Tools 485  A Sample FTP Session 489  Project: Common Problems with DOS Internet Tools 491   484  Chapter 21 Connecting to the Internet  Internet Connection Options for DOS-Based Computers  Although you can connect a DOS-based computer directly to the Internet  through an ISP using a PPP connection , this is almost never done. Instead, you can more easily use a ter- minal emulation program to dial in to what is called a shell account with an ISP, such as Netcom. Dialing in this way gives you the appearance of sitting at a Unix-based terminal connected to the Internet. You can use all the Unix tools to perform various tasks on the Internet, such as transferring files from a remote host to your shell account  FTP , opening a terminal session on another computer on the Internet  Telnet , searching for information using Gopher, or getting rudimentary access  text based  to the World Wide Web.  You also need to be aware of another aspect of using DOS with the Internet. Even when you have a Windows-based PC, many of the basic tools for the Internet are text based and work very well in a DOS window. So, you can connect your Windows 9x PC to an ISP; open a DOS window; and run FTP, Telnet, or other DOS-based Internet utilities, for exam- ple. In this chapter, you learn about both these DOS-based Internet access methods.  Connecting to Your ISP  Many ISPs offer a type of account called a shell account. This account enables you to dial in to the ISP’s system using just about any type of computer, provided it has a terminal emula- tion program that is compatible with the terminal emulation of the shell account  most are . After you have connected, the terminal emulation program gives you a window to a Unix host at the ISP  which means that you’ll be using Unix commands , from which you can perform most Internet-related work. Most shell accounts include a certain amount of disk space in which you can store files you’ve retrieved from other systems or have uploaded from your own computer, and often you can even upload Web pages to the disk space and use the WWW services of your ISP to serve those Web pages up to others.  To connect to an ISP with a shell account, you use a terminal emulation program such as Procomm Plus, SmartTerm, or one of many others. Good shareware terminal emulation programs are also available, such as the top-rated Telix, Qmodem, or SlickTerminal, all of which can be downloaded from a number of Internet sites, including www.zdnet.com.  Usually, connecting to the ISP is relatively easy. Using the information provided by the ISP, follow these steps:  1. Set the terminal emulation program’s parameters  COM port, modem type, baud rate,  data bits, stop bits, and parity .  2. Set the phone number for the ISP. 3. Dial the number.  After connecting, you see a prompt and can use the basic Unix commands listed in  Table 21.1.   Using Internet Tools  485  Table 21.1 Basic Unix Commands  Command  Parameters  directory_name  Description Changes directory. If you don’t specify a direc- tory, it displays your current directory.  source_file dest_file  Copies a file.  Optional wildcards  Lists files  very similar to DIR .  source_file dest_file  Moves a file.  cd  cp  ls  mv  Keep in mind that, unlike DOS systems, Unix systems are case sensitive. In Unix, you’re free to have four files called File, file, FILE, and FiLE, all in the same directory. This also means that your commands don’t work correctly unless you match the case of the file you’re operating on exactly.  Another point to keep in mind is that Unix uses the forward slash     for directory separa- tors instead of the DOS backslash  \ .  Using Internet Tools  Whether you are using a shell account or a DOS window on a Windows computer connect- ed to the Internet, you use two key Internet tools. Fortunately, these tools function almost identically either way; Telnet and FTP work similarly under Unix as in a DOS window.  Using the Telnet program is extremely easy. You simply type a command at the shell prompt, followed by the address of the computer to which you want to connect, and press Enter. When you connect to the computer in question, you are prompted for a username and password. After you’ve logged on to the remote system, you proceed just like you’re sit- ting at a terminal connected to that other system. Working this way can get rather confusing after a while because you can use the remote system to telnet to another system, to yet another system, and so forth.  In some cases, you specify not only the remote system’s address, but also a port number. Unix hosts on the Internet can host a number of different services, and often certain services are restricted to certain port numbers. You specify these port numbers after the address, sep- arated by a space.  Telnet usernames and passwords are case sensitive.  Most publicly available Telnet systems might not require a username and password; you might be able to connect immediately, although in these cases, you are usually restricted to limited actions on the remote system. For example, if you use Telnet to access um-weather. sprl.umich.edu:3000  note the port number 3000 being used , you quickly connect to a  Part IV Ch 21   486  Chapter 21 Connecting to the Internet  menu system that gives you up-to-date weather conditions for cities all over the U.S. However, you then cannot use Telnet on that computer to connect to another. Instead, you simply disconnect from that host and open a new host  which is actually what you do all the time anyway; anything else is not very productive .  The abbreviation FTP stands for two different things; it stands for both file transfer protocol as well as file transfer program. In fact, the FTP program uses the FTP protocol to do its work; they were developed at the same time and for the same purpose.  FTP enables you to transfer files to and from an FTP server over the Internet. For example, you might use Microsoft’s FTP server to download a patch for one of its products and use the FTP program to do so. You also might have an FTP server in your organization that you transfer files to and from.  You connect to an FTP server by typing FTP at a command prompt  either DOS window or shell account prompt , followed by the address of the server you want to log in to. You then are prompted for your username and password. Note that many FTP servers are set up to allow anonymous access. For these servers, you type anonymous as the username and your  e-mail address as the password.  After you have connected to an FTP server, all the various FTP commands are available to you. Usually, you can get an onscreen list of these commands by typing either ? or HELP and pressing Enter. Figure 21.1 shows the DOS FTP client included with Windows 98 with its help screen displayed. To get a limited amount of help with any particular command, type either ? or HELP, followed by the name of the command.  The commands in the FTP program are not case sensitive. Keep in mind, however, that the file and directory names that you often work with on Unix are.  Figure 21.1 A sample FTP pro- gram with its help  display.   There are a number of important and regularly used commands in the FTP program. Table 21.2 details these FTP commands.  Using Internet Tools  487  Directory name  Changes directory on the remote system.  Table 21.2  FTP Command Summary  Command  ASCII  Parameters None  BINARY  None  None  None  DELETE  Filename  Directory or wildcard  Filename  Directory name  Directory or wildcard  BYE  CD  CLOSE  DIR  GET  LCD  LS  Description Sets the ASCII file transfer type. Any retrieved or sent files are processed as though they were ASCII files. This is the default mode for FTP but should not be used when you’re transferring binary files.  Sets the binary file transfer type, where any received or sent files are sent exactly as they occur, byte by byte. You almost always should issue this command immediately after starting FTP because most file transfers require it for the resulting file to be usable.  Closes the connection and exits the FTP pro- gram.  Terminates the FTP session with the remote FTP server but leaves the FTP program open and ready to connect to another server.  Deletes a remote file. Note that most FTP servers don’t enable you to delete a remote file unless you have complete ownership of the file in question.  Lists contents of files on remote systems. This command is identical to ls -l.  Retrieves a single file from the remote system. Make sure you choose the right file transfer mode first.  Changes the local directory name. Use this command before you retrieve a file from the remote system if you don’t start FTP from  the directory in which you want to store the received file.  Functions similarly to the DOS DIR com- mand. You also might  on some systems  append different parameters to get different types of listings. For example, try -l and -w. You need not use a directory or wildcard with this command; again, it’s just like DIR in this respect. If you leave off the parameter, all files in the current directory are listed.  Part IV Ch 21  DISCONNECT  None  Same as the CLOSE command.   488  Chapter 21 Connecting to the Internet  Table 21.2 Continued  Command MDELETE  Parameters  Wildcard  MGET  Wildcard  MKDIR  MPUT  OPEN  PROMPT  PUT  PWD  QUIT  RECV  RENAME  RMDIR  SEND  STATUS  !  REMOTEHELP  Directory name  Wildcard  FTP Server Name  None  Filename  None  None  Filename  None  Filename  None  Various  Description Deletes multiple files. You must have permis- sion to delete files on the remote system.  Gets multiple files from a remote system. For example, MGET *.* gets all the files in the current directory.  Creates a directory on the remote system.  Sends multiple files to a remote system. You must have file create privileges for the direc- tory to which you are sending the files.  Opens a connection to the specified FTP server.  Toggles on and off the prompt setting. The default is to prompt you for each file when you use MPUT or MGET. Typing PROMPT before using those commands enables them to pro- ceed much faster, without file-by-file confir- mation from you.  Transfers a file to a remote system. You must have file create privileges on the remote  system.  Displays  prints  the working directory on the remote system.  Closes the FTP connection and exits FTP.  Synonymous with GET; works the same.  Displays commands accepted by the remote system.  Synonymous with PUT.  Displays current connection status.  Placing the exclamation point in front of most of the FTP commands makes them apply to your own computer. For example, !dir lists files in your local directory. Similarly, com- mands such as !cd, !mkdir, and !rmdir per- form those functions on your computer without interrupting your FTP session.  Src_file Dest_file  Renames a file on the remote system.  Directory name  Removes a directory on the remote system.   A Sample FTP Session  489  A Sample FTP Session  Now that you know what FTP does, review this section to see how it actually works. For this example, you see how to start FTP, connect to Microsoft’s FTP server  used as an exam- ple , display and list directories, navigate to a particular directory, and retrieve the files con- tained there.  Start from the directory to which you want to transfer files. Starting from this directory saves time because you don’t have to perform the !cd command within the FTP program when you start it.  In this example, the client networking files for MS-DOS will be retrieved from Microsoft’s FTP server. The files will be placed in the C:\CLIENT directory, so that directory is chosen before starting the FTP program by simply typing FTP and pressing Enter. Follow these steps:  1.  After you start FTP, connect to the site by using the OPEN command, as follows, and  then pressing Enter: open ftp.microsoft.com  2. After connecting, you are prompted for a username and password. Type anonymous for the username and your e-mail address as the password. Figure 21.2 shows the results of completing these steps.  Figure 21.2 Connecting to ftp.microsoft. com.  3. After your password is accepted, you can get your bearings on the remote system by using the ls command. It is preferable to use ls -l because you then can tell the dif- ference between files and directories. Figure 22.3 shows the results of using the ls -l command.  Part IV Ch 21   490  Chapter 21 Connecting to the Internet  Figure 21.3 Using the ls -l command.  Note several important points about the display shown in Figure 21.3. First, the file and directory names are shown at the far right of each line. To their immediate left, you can see the size of the entry. On the extreme left, you can tell whether the entry is a file or directory. If you see the letter d listed in the first column, the entry is a directory; a dash indicates that the entry is a file.  4. Because you’re looking for client software for a server product in this example, you  deduce that it might be found in the bussys subdirectory. Switch to that directory by typing the following command and pressing Enter: cd bussys  5. Repeat the ls -l command to see what’s in the bussys directory. There, you see a  directory called Clients. Switch to it by using cd Clients  note the case sensitivity  and perform another ls -l to see what’s there. Voil[ag]a! You see a directory called MSCLIENT, which is what you are looking for. You can make one last change to that directory by typing cd MSCLIENT and a final ls -l to see what files are available. Figure 21.4 shows the results of these steps.  Figure 21.4 Finding the MSCLIENT directory.   Project: Common Problems with DOS Internet Tools  491  You see that this directory contains two files: DSK3-1.EXE and DSK3-2.EXE. To retrieve them, follow these additional steps:  1. Type BINARY and press Enter to use a binary file transfer mode. Failing to complete this  step renders the files unusable. You see the response Type set to I.  2. Turn off multiple file-prompting by typing PROMPT and pressing Enter. You then see the  response Interactive mode Off.  3. Retrieve both files by typing MGET *.* and pressing Enter. You see each file transfer   this response might take a while if you’re using a slower modem connection .  Figure 21.5 shows the results of these final steps.  Figure 21.5 Retrieving two files from an FTP site.  After you retrieve the files, simply type QUIT or BYE to terminate the connection and exit FTP. That’s it!  Project: Common Problems with DOS Internet Tools  Unfortunately, the full power of the World Wide Web and Internet is not easily available from the world of DOS. However, you still can perform extremely important tasks from DOS on the Internet, including accessing some important information sources with Telnet and transferring files that you might require. In fact, even if you use a Windows-based PC, you might find that you occasionally prefer to open an MS-DOS prompt to use these tools. Not only can they be very productive, but they also can serve to help troubleshoot any Windows-based versions of these tools that you might be using.  If you plan to use a shell account with an ISP, spend some time combing through the ISP’s various help files  most have an extensive library of these files . You also can use the Unix man  short for Manual  command to access detailed information on all the Unix commands   492  Chapter 21 Connecting to the Internet  available to you through a shell account. It wasn’t really very long ago, actually, when shell accounts were the only thing that worked on the Internet, and in fact I used them extensive- ly before the Web was truly born. Although often cryptic and confusing, a shell account can also be incredibly productive in a Unix system, although mastering it does require an invest- ment of your time.  Some common problems might crop up as you use these tools. The following are things to watch out for:    Remember that Unix is case sensitive. Because most PC operating systems  DOS,  Windows, OS 2, and so forth  are not case sensitive, you can easily forget this impor- tant fact.    If you are having trouble connecting to a site using Telnet or FTP, make sure the site exists and is operating. Type the command ping, followed by the name of the site, to perform a basic connectivity test. The ping command reports whether it can connect to the site and can send and receive a small amount of test data. If ping can’t connect to a site, make sure that you have the correct address and that you’re using the right case for the name of the site. You might just need to try again later; sites can often crash and be unavailable until their administrators fix whatever problem they’re having.    Many sites have limits to the number of users they allow at any given time. Sometimes Telnet or FTP reports that there are too many users and that you are being disconnect- ed. The only solution to this problem is to keep trying, perhaps during a time when the site is unlikely to be so busy.    If a site doesn’t allow anonymous access, you need to have a proper username and pass- word to access the site. Some sites require that you send an e-mail to the site’s adminis- trator requesting access or take some other steps to secure an account.    Many sites restrict what commands you can perform on them using Telnet or FTP. For example, some FTP sites enable you to use the command ls –l, whereas others enable you to use only the short form, ls. Other commands might be similarly restricted, such as commands that move or delete files. Sites that employ such restrictions usually post a notice that you see after you have logged in, or they might include a text file that describes these restrictions in their  pub directory.  When you use a shell account and the Unix and Internet tools discussed in this chapter, plan to spend plenty of time learning to use these tools. Most shell account providers have exten- sive libraries of files describing how to use the tools they make available, in addition to the information you can find by using the Unix man command. Also, consider purchasing a basic Unix book, such as Que’s Practical Unix.   CHAPTER  22  Third-Party Utilities In this chapter  Enhancing Your Computer with Utility Programs 494  Understanding Freeware, Shareware, and Demoware 494  PKWare’s PKZIP and PKUNZIP 495  McAfee VirusScan 496  4DOS 497   494  Chapter 22 Third-Party Utilities  Enhancing Your Computer with Utility Programs  Because DOS has been available for so long and has been used on so many computer sys- tems over the years, several utility programs that run under DOS and can accomplish vari- ous useful tasks are available. Many of these utilities are available either free or as shareware programs that you can evaluate free and then pay to license if you decide to keep them.  In this chapter, you learn about several such powerful utility programs for DOS; they can help you accomplish more with a DOS-based computer system or even make better use of the DOS command prompt in Windows and OS 2. The following DOS-based utility pro- grams are covered in this chapter:    PKZIP and PKUNZIP by PKWare   McAfee VirusScan   4DOS by JP Software  Using these programs, you can increase your capability to manage files under DOS; to remain free of computer viruses; to create, manage, and extract compressed file archives; and to make the best use of the DOS command prompt.  Understanding Freeware, Shareware, and Demoware  Programmers write computer programs for many reasons: for fun, for profit, as demonstra- tions, as self-educational projects, or to solve some computing problem that they have noticed. However, not every program has the commercial appeal of, say, an Intuit Quicken or a Microsoft Word.  Sometimes programmers choose to make their programs available to others free. When they do so, it is understood that the programs are available on an as is basis with no warranty and no support from the programmers if some kind of problem occurs. If the program does something useful for you, that’s great. If it doesn’t, at least it didn’t cost you anything. Note that programs distributed free—often called freeware—usually still carry restrictions that you cannot modify the program in any way and that the programmer’s original copyright must be left intact. You are typically also free to give copies to others, although you need to exam- ine each program’s copyright notice for details because they vary from program to program.  Some software programmers often choose to sell their creations using an electronic version of a “word of mouth” sales approach called shareware. In this model, people are free to download and try the software for a limited period of time  usually 30 days or so ; and then, if they choose to keep the software, they pay the programmer a reasonable license fee. Users are encouraged to pass along shareware programs they like to other people, who also must pay to license the software if they want to keep it. The basic idea is to make software avail- able for sale with much lower selling and distribution costs than traditional software, with both the programmer and user benefiting from the more efficient transaction: The  programmer makes more money on each copy sold, and the user pays much less for useful   PKWare’s PKZIP and PKUNZIP  495  software. Shareware programs are typically sold with some sort of warranty, with support from the maker, and often with other benefits such as free upgrades to newer versions that become available. Note that all these benefits usually accrue only to buyers of the software, not to those who are simply evaluating the programs.  Another form of program is sometimes called demoware. With demoware, the software has been modified so that certain key functions do not work. For instance, a demonstration of a program that generates reports might print only one page of its reports or might print all pages with a prominent notice that the software is unlicensed.  Sometimes software like this is uncharitably called crippleware because key functions are deliberately crippled.  Usually, after a user has paid for a license, the crippled functions are restored, or a properly function- ing version of the program is sent to the buyer.  The third-party utilities described in this chapter are, for the most part, shareware. All their functions work properly, although continued use requires that you pay for a copy of the pro- gram. The nice thing is that all these utilities are very powerful and useful, easy to get, and inexpensive to purchase if you want to continue using them.  Part IV Ch 22  As each program is described, its license terms are noted. However, you should read the appropriate notices for each program—or for any others of this type that you download and use—and comply with them.  PKWare’s PKZIP and PKUNZIP  PKZIP and PKUNZIP are programs that can create and read special archive files. These archive files are called Zip files, and they invariably end with the .ZIP file extension. Zip files are special archive files that contain compressed copies of one or more normal files. Because of the compression that takes place for Zip files, Zip files are usually many times smaller than the original files themselves. The PKZIP program creates Zip files, whereas the PKUNZIP program reads files from within a Zip file and places copies on your disk.  Two other programs included as part of the shareware version of PKZIP are described in Table 22.1.  You can find PKWare on the Web at http:  www.pkware.com .  Table 22.1 Programs in PKZIP  Program Name  PKZIP.EXE  PKUNZIP.EXE  PKZIPFIX.EXE  ZIP2EXE.EXE  Description Creates Zip files  Extracts files from within Zip files  Repairs damaged Zip files  Creates self-extracting Zip files   496  Chapter 22 Third-Party Utilities  The PKZIP programs are essential for almost any computer user. They enable you to accomplish many important tasks that you cannot otherwise accomplish with DOS alone, such as the following:    Save space on your hard disk by putting infrequently used files into Zip files.   Save much time transmitting files to or from other people. Provided both parties have PKZIP, you can spend as little as one-tenth the time transmitting Zip files to another person than if you were sending the actual uncompressed files.    Allow large files to fit on a disk when they otherwise do not.   Access the many Zip files available for download over the Internet. Zip files tend to be  the preferred method for distributing sizable documents and program files.  You can view a quick reference of the parameters for PKZIP.EXE and PKUNZIP.EXE by typing the program names at the command prompt with no parameters.  McAfee VirusScan  McAfee VirusScan is one of the most widely distributed shareware programs in existence. McAfee VirusScan can rapidly scan your computer for viruses, even looking inside docu- ments for macro viruses.  What Is a Computer Virus? A computer virus is a self-replicating program that transmits copies of itself through various methods. Such methods include floppy disks, executable program files, certain types of documents, and some e-mail attach- ments. Thousands of different computer viruses are around, and their effects range from being relatively innocuous to very serious, including some that can destroy data on your computer and—in very rare cases—can even damage some hardware components  for instance, some older monitors can be set to operate in a mode that damages them .  Computer viruses are almost never transmitted through commercial software programs. If you use only prepackaged programs and work with documents that you generate yourself, you probably don’t have to worry too much about computer viruses. However, if you occasionally download programs from the Internet or work with documents  such as Word or Excel documents  that other people also access and use, routinely check your system for computer viruses. Computer viruses are unfortunately common these days; it’s better to be safe than sorry.  You can download McAfee VirusScan for DOS or for other operating systems from the McAfee home page at http:  www.mcafee.com.   4DOS  497  Part IV Ch 22  McAfee VirusScan is downloaded as a single Zip file that, when extracted using PKUNZIP, results in a main program file and a number of support files. The main program file is called either SCAN.EXE or SCANPM.EXE, depending on which of two possible DOS versions you are using. In a pure DOS environment, you use SCAN.EXE. SCANPM.EXE, on the other hand, is a DOS version intended for use with protected-mode versions of DOS, such as the DOS built into Windows 98 or OS 2.  To run a simple scan of a disk drive using VirusScan, type the program name  SCAN or SCANPM , followed by the drive letter to be scanned. The scan starts immediately, and any detected viruses are reported to you, along with a prompt asking whether you want to repair or delete the infected file.  Unless you use your computer disconnected from all other computers, using only your own documents and prepackaged software, you need to regularly scan your system for computer viruses. They are unfortunately common these days, and they can sit dormant on your sys- tem for years until the right circumstances trigger them. When triggered, they can wreak havoc on your computer’s programs and data, and can require professional assistance for removal—in addition to possibly causing loss of data. Aside from regularly scanning your system for viruses with a program such as McAfee VirusScan, you also need to make regular backups of your important data, which can help protect you from data loss, regardless of whether it is caused by a computer virus or something else.  4DOS  Quite possibly the best utility program for DOS discussed in this chapter is a program called 4DOS, which actually serves to improve upon DOS in virtually every way conceiv- able. 4DOS is from a company called JP Software, and it replaces DOS’s COMMAND.COM with a much more competent version that contains many powerful features not found in MS-DOS or any other DOS. Versions of 4DOS that can run under Windows 9x ME, Windows NT 2000, and OS 2 also are available.  On the Web, look for JP Software at http:  www.jpsoft.com .  4DOS doesn’t change the behavior of any of the DOS commands you have already learned, but it does add more features to all of them. For instance, the DIR command still works in the same way in 4DOS, but it also accepts a larger number of parameters that enable you to format its output much more flexibly than you can with the DIR command in standard DOS. Furthermore, the TYPE command, which cannot accept wildcards or multiple filenames under DOS, easily does so with 4DOS. Table 22.2 shows the major improvements that 4DOS makes to existing DOS commands.   498  Chapter 22 Third-Party Utilities  Table 22.2  Important Improvements to Existing DOS Commands with 4DOS  Command  DEL  ERASE   CD  CLS  COPY  DIR  MD  MOVE  ON  PAUSE  REN  Improvements Accepts more than two periods to move up more than one directory. For instance, CD .... moves up three directory levels.  Enables you to specify colors to be used when the screen is cleared.  Enables you to copy to or from a Clipboard area with the CLIP: device name.  Accepts multiple filenames  list each one separated by a space ; accepts attribute masking; accepts an  S parameter to include subdirectories  use with caution ; adds wipe capabilities where deleted files are first overwritten with zeros, mak- ing recovery nearly impossible.  Adds new formatting options.  Adds the capability to create multiple subdirectories at once.  Adds new options.  Adds new options.  Allows more flexible processing of ON condition commands.  Enables you to display a specified message as part of the PAUSE command.  In addition to extending the functionality of DOS commands, 4DOS adds new commands not available in DOS. For example, you might have been frustrated by the CD command’s incapability to change disk drives along with directories. 4DOS contains a command called CDD that enables you to do just that. Or perhaps you have wished for a timed pause for batch files instead of DOS’s simple PAUSE command, which waits for a key to be pressed. 4DOS adds a command called DELAY that pauses a batch file for a specified number of seconds. Table 22.3 shows important new commands available in 4DOS that are not generally includ- ed with DOS.  Table 22.3 New Commands with 4DOS  Command  BEEP  CANCEL  CDD  COLOR  DELAY  DESCRIBE  DIRHISTORY  Description Sounds the speaker at a specified frequency for a specified number of seconds  Cancels processing of a batch file; returns a specified error code that can be used by ERRORLEVEL processing  Changes the drive letter and directory with one command  Sets new text colors to be used for text displayed after the command is given, such as in a batch file  Pauses batch file execution for a specified number of seconds  Enables you to store long file descriptions, even for 8.3-character filenames  Displays a list of directories accessed  pressing Ctrl+PgUp displays a list from which you can choose a directory without using this command    4DOS  499  Part IV Ch 22  Table 22.3 Continued  HISTORY  Displays a history of commands used  Provides IF-THEN-ELSE processing  DOS provides only the IF command   Description Draws a box on the screen; useful formatting for batch file displays  Draws a horizontal line at specified coordinates  Draws a vertical line at specified coordinates  Enables you to edit environment variables  Enables you to exclude files from processing; for instance, you can use COPY *.* EXCEPT *.TXT  Searches for specified files  Displays free space totals for disks  Executes a specified command for multiple directories  Provides subroutine processing in a batch file  Prompts you for a single key in a batch file  Prompts you for input in a batch file  Passes keystrokes to an executed program; can often be used to automate pro- cessing in a program that otherwise doesn’t allow automation  Displays a scrollable view of a file; far superior to TYPE  Allows batch files with a .BTM extension to run 2 to 10 times faster than normal .BAT files  Saves a list of used commands to a log file  Displays the status of system memory  Reboots the computer  Displays a message at certain coordinates on the screen  Displays text at certain coordinates in a specified color  Enables you to tag files to be processed by a command  Allows a program to display its output to the screen, simultaneously capturing it to a file  Enables you to build and display a block of text in a batch file  Provides a stopwatch; useful for timing commands or building quick-and-dirty performance tests  Enables you to set the modify and create times and dates for files  Command  DRAWBOX  DRAWHLINE  DRAWVLINE  ESET  EXCEPT  FFIND  FREE  GLOBAL  GOSUB  IFF  INKEY  INPUT  KEYSTACK  LIST  LOADBTM  LOG  MEMORY  REBOOT  SCREEN  SCRPUT  SELECT  TEE  TEXT  TIMER  TOUCH  TREE  UNSET  Displays a tree of directories  Removes an environment variable  VSCRPUT  Displays text vertically on the screen   500  Chapter 22 Third-Party Utilities  You can use the various 4DOS drawing commands, along with the color commands, to make professional-looking batch files. Add use of the INKEY and subroutine processing features, and you can construct a simple menu in 4DOS that beats anything you can do  in DOS.  Another powerful feature of 4DOS is extended batch file capabilities, including a built-in batch file debugger that enables you to step through batch files and more easily solve prob- lems within them. Add to this the capability to use BTM files that run much more quickly than standard BAT files, along with the powerful batch file commands available in 4DOS, and you can see that you can do much, much more with 4DOS batch files than with DOS batch files.  The added batch file capabilities of 4DOS are truly stunning. They almost  but not quite  give DOS batch files the power of a full programming language. The only drawback is that for them to work, any machine using the enhanced batch file must also have 4DOS installed. If you manage a number of machines, you might want to consider a license to use 4DOS on many machines for just this reason.  If you really want to become a DOS wizard, adding 4DOS to your bag of tricks can take you very far, indeed. The nice thing about 4DOS is that you can start using it without knowing much about it because DOS commands still work the same way. As you come across situations in which you wish DOS had some additional feature, you can open the 4DOS help file and see whether it helps you solve a particular problem. Chances are excel- lent that 4DOS can help you accomplish many tasks you want to perform in DOS.

When you bought a new computer, you received the OEM version, which might  or might not  include additional utilities specific to your computer system. Two separate upgrade versions also were available. The Microsoft MS-DOS 6.22 Upgrade package could be installed only on a computer running a previous version of DOS, whereas the StepUp version could be installed only on computers running MS-DOS 6.0 because this version simply made changes to the MS-DOS 6.0 files on your disk. In either case, most of the files remain the same, and the descriptions in this appendix apply to either version.  The list of MS-DOS 6.22 files in the following section is arranged alphabetically, with sup- port files grouped under the associated main file. Each is accompanied by a short descrip- tion of how the file is used.  The files are marked with the following designations where appropriate:  Vital  Keep  Danger!  Remove?  80286  80386  Windows  International  Files that are required to run MS-DOS Files you need to keep handy Dangerous files you might want to move off the path Files few people use or need Files you need only if you use the international features of DOS Files that require an 80286 or higher processor to use Files that require an 80386 or higher processor to use Files that are useful only if you are running Microsoft Windows  If you decide to remove any of these files from your hard disk, play it safe and copy them to a floppy disk first. That way, you can get them back easily if you make a mistake. Setup places most of these files in the subdirectory you choose, normally C:\DOS. Exceptions are noted.  Most of these files are distributed in a compressed form. Microsoft indicates this fact by replacing the last character of the filename extension with an underscore  _ . When Setup installs these files on your system, they are expanded and renamed automatically. If you copy the files from the distribution disks, however, you need to use the Expand utility  located on Setup Disk 1  to make the files usable.

Industry legend has it that the GW in GWBASIC stands for gee whiz.    518  Appendix A Files Supplied with MS-DOS 6.22  **FC and COMP have had a confusing journey through the various DOS versions. IBM originally included COMP with PC DOS 1.0, and then it disappeared in subsequent IBM releases, reappearing officially in MS- DOS 3.3. During this period, many OEMs added utilities to their versions of MS-DOS. A popular add-on was COMP, often under a different name  such as FILCOM, FC, or COMPARE . Even Microsoft’s generic MS- DOS often included some type of file compare utility. Mapping all these variations is overly complicated, so the table just indicates that COMP has been with DOS since the beginning.   APPENDIX  B  DOS Environment Variables In this appendix  Understanding the DOS Environment 520  APPEND 520  COMSPEC 521  CONFIG 521  COPYCMD 522  DIRCMD 522  MSDOSDATA 523  PATH 524  PROMPT 525  TEMP and TMP 525  windir 526  WINPMT 526   520  Appendix B DOS Environment Variables  Understanding the DOS Environment  The environment is a small area in memory that DOS sets aside for storing text variables. Normally, you set the size of the master environment area with a SHELL = statement in your CONFIG.SYS file. The default size of the environment is 256 bytes, but you almost certainly want to increase this size as you begin to use environment variables to automate your daily tasks.  Each variable in the environment consists of two parts: the name of the variable, which DOS stores in uppercase characters, and the contents of the variable, which is the text asso- ciated with the variable. Normally, you view, create, and replace environment variables by using the SET command. The PATH and PROMPT commands store their settings in the environ- ment. MS-DOS automatically creates certain environment variables, such as COMSPEC and CONFIG, when you start up your computer.  Whenever DOS loads a program into memory, it makes a copy of the current environment and passes this copy to the program. This copy is only big enough to include the variables currently defined in the environment, rounded up to an even multiple of 16 bytes. Although this use of memory is efficient, it is inconvenient for people who normally operate from a shell program such as DOS Shell, Norton Commander, or XTree because not much envi- ronment space is available, no matter how large an environment area you set aside. If you get an Out of environment space message while you are running a shell program, quit the shell and try the operation again. If you still receive an error message, you must increase the size of the master environment by using the SHELL= statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  The following sections list the standard environment variables used by MS-DOS. Also noted is the version of DOS in which the variable first appeared, along with the creator of the variable. An MS-DOS label indicates that this variable is created automatically when your computer starts up. A User label indicates that you must create it by using the SET com- mand or, for certain variables, the PATH, PROMPT, or APPEND command. A Windows label indi- cates that the environment variable is created by Microsoft Windows.  APPEND  The APPEND environment variable is created by DOS if you specify the  E parameter when loading APPEND into memory. With the  E parameter, APPEND stores the appended directory search path in the environment instead of internally.  This variable is stored much like the PATH variable. It is a list of subdirectories to be searched, separated by semicolons. If the APPEND environment variable is created with the SET command, it might appear like this: SET APPEND=C:\DOS;C:\WS  When you instruct APPEND to store the appended directory search path in the environment, you can change or replace the search path by using the SET command as well as the APPEND command.   CONFIG  521  Note that APPEND  E does not work if you are launching programs that must search the appended directory search path from a shell program such as DOS Shell, Norton Commander, or XTree. In such cases, APPEND must store the appended directory search path internally.  COMSPEC  The COMSPEC variable points to the active copy of the command interpreter shell loaded with the SHELL= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. All of COMMAND.COM isn’t in memory all the time; when parts of it must be reloaded, the COMSPEC variable is used to find the COMMAND.COM file on disk.  In the following SHELL= command, COMMAND.COM sets the COMSPEC variable using the C:\DOS\ parameter that follows the command interpreter’s name: SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\  E:512  P  DOS executes the SHELL= command at the end of CONFIG.SYS processing. When it does, COMMAND.COM sets the COMSPEC variable in the environment as if it had executed SET COM- SPEC=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM.  Note that COMMAND.COM doesn’t actually use the SET command.   Many programs search the environment for the COMSPEC variable when they must locate  COMMAND.COM. If you have trouble shelling to a DOS prompt from one of your application programs, check the COMSPEC environment variable and make sure that it’s pointing to a valid copy of COMMAND.COM.  App B  CONFIG  When MS-DOS processes a startup menu in CONFIG.SYS, it defines the CONFIG environment variable, setting it equal to the block name of the menu item you selected. You can use the CONFIG environment variable with GOTO and IF in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to continue making choices based on the configuration chosen in the startup menu.  For example, assume that your CONFIG.SYS file includes the following startup menu: [MENU] MENUITEM=WIN, Configure for Windows  default  MENUITEM=DOS, Configure for MS-DOS MENUITEM=MAINT, Configure for file & disk maintenance MENUDEFAULT=WIN, 10  The CONFIG environment variable is set equal to WIN, DOS, or MAINT, depending on which configuration you select when your computer displays the startup menu. In your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you can check this value and process different commands for each config- uration. For example, you might set up separate sections for each startup configuration and label them with the block names you used in your CONFIG.SYS file, which in this case are :WIN, :DOS, and :MAINT.  For more information on block names, see the [blockname] entry in   522  Appendix B DOS Environment Variables  Appendix F, “Command Reference.”  Then, a simple GOTO statement such as the following might be all you need to jump to the correct section of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file: GOTO %CONFIG%  A slightly safer method is to check each value with an IF statement and report an error if an unexpected value for CONFIG is encountered: IF %CONFIG%x==WINx GOTO WIN IF %CONFIG%x==DOSx GOTO DOS IF %CONFIG%x==MAINTx GOTO MAINT GOTO ERROR  The use of x prevents the generation of an error message if the CONFIG environment variable is null or undefined. When you use an IF comparison, always include a character  any char- acter will do  that prevents one side of the equation from being empty.  COPYCMD  Starting with MS-DOS 6.2, COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY all prompt for confirmation before over- writing a file. Because this behavior might wreak havoc with your old batch files, this behav- ior is the default only when these commands are run from the command line. If COPY, MOVE, or XCOPY is run from a batch file, it overwrites files without warning, which is its behavior in previous versions of DOS.  You can change the new default behavior by defining an environment variable named  COPYCMD. To force COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY to prompt you before overwriting a file in all cases, even from a batch file, add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file: SET COPYCMD= -Y  To prevent COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY from prompting before overwriting a file, add the follow- ing line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file: SET COPYCMD= Y  DIRCMD  The DIRCMD environment variable customizes the default options the DIR command uses. When you run the DIR command, the contents of the DIRCMD environment variable—if it exists—are added invisibly to what you type on the command line.  Suppose that you prefer filenames in lowercase letters, sorted by directories and then sorted by date and time. You also want the screen to pause after each page of files is displayed. You can define the DIRCMD variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file as follows: SET DIRCMD= L  O:GD  P  Now you don’t have to enter those options every time you want to use them. To override these options, specify the switch with a hyphen added before the letter. For example, to turn off the pause option in your customized DIR command, enter the following command: DIR  -P   MSDOSDATA  523  Note that overriding options this way is temporary and changes only the behavior of the command in which the override switch appears.  MSDOSDATA  The MSDOSDATA environment variable defines where certain DOS utility programs look for their data files. Defining this variable can make it easier to keep programs and data separate on your hard disk. Defining the variable can make it easier also to run these utility programs from a network using individual configuration files.  The most convenient place to define the MSDOSDATA variable is in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file with a SET command. Here’s an example: SET MSDOSDATA=C:\DOS\DATA  App B  This line sets MSDOSDATA to point to the C:\DOS\DATA subdirectory on your hard drive. Note that this subdirectory has to exist first; the SET command does not create it for you.  Table B.1 provides a list of the MS-DOS programs that create data files as well as the loca- tions where the programs look for the data files.

Locations shown in all caps are environment variables that point to subdirecto- ries. Programs that list both a primary and secondary location search for the data file in the primary location first.  If you set up a separate data subdirectory for MS-DOS, you might need to move some of these data files from your DOS subdirectory to that subdirectory. See the MOVE command in Appendix F, “Command Reference,” for details about how to move a file.  PATH  The PATH command stores its settings in the DOS environment under the PATH variable name.  You can set the path by using either the PATH or SET command.  You probably should set the initial DOS search path in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. DOS does not define a default PATH automatically, although the Setup program for DOS 6 does insert the PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file if you don’t have one there already.  DOS uses the PATH environment variable to find executable files. Whenever a command is executed, DOS searches for the first word on the command line in the following:    The DOSKEY macro list, if DOSKEY is loaded   The COMMAND.COM internal command list   Files with an extension of COM, then EXE, and then BAT in the current directory   Files with an extension of COM, then EXE, and then BAT in the first directory listed in the  PATH variable   TEMP and TMP  525    Files with an extension of COM, then EXE, and then BAT in the second directory listed in  the PATH variable    Files with an extension of COM, then EXE, and then BAT in the next directory listed in the  PATH variable, and so on until the last subdirectory in the PATH variable has been searched  You can modify this order depending on what parts of the full pathname you enter with the command name. If you specify a drive or path with the filename, only that drive and path are searched. If you specify an extension, the other extensions are not searched for. The DOSKEY macro and internal command search are skipped if you include a disk drive or path that includes a backslash in the name of the command, but not if you include only an exten- sion.  App B  Other programs might search the PATH variable as well. Programs that require the addition of their subdirectory to the PATH often use the PATH environment variable to find overlay and help files.  PROMPT  The PROMPT environment variable describes the type of command-line prompt you want DOS to use. It is set by the user with either the PROMPT or SET PROMPT= command. The default command-line prompt that DOS uses if the PROMPT environment variable is unde- fined is the letter of the current drive and >—for example, C>.  If the PROMPT environment variable doesn’t exist, the DOS 6.0, 6.2, and 6.22 versions of  COMMAND.COM create it automatically with a value of $P$G. This prompt shows the current directory as well as the current drive; for example, C:\DOS>. The only way to have the PROMPT environment variable undefined is to delete it.  The PROMPT environment variable uses meta-strings to include system information in the command prompt. For a description of which meta-strings are available and how they can be used, see the entry for PROMPT in the “Command Reference.”  TEMP and TMP  Many programs use the TEMP environment variable as the preferred place to create and delete temporary files. This environment variable evolved somewhat informally, which is why it has two popular spellings: TEMP and TMP. TEMP is the more common variation and is the one DOS uses. Typically, if the TEMP environment variable isn’t defined, the program creates its temporary files in the root directory of the current drive  or sometimes the start- up drive .   526  Appendix B DOS Environment Variables  DOS creates the following types of files in the directory pointed to by the TEMP environment variable:    Files required by the use of redirection     or piping      Swap files created by the DOS Shell Task Swapper   Temporary files created by any full-screen application program, such as MSAV, MSBACKUP,  and QBASIC    Temporary disk data storage for DISKCOPY   Microsoft Windows Print Manager spooling files   Microsoft Windows swapping files  standard mode only   Many programs use the TEMP environment variable if it is defined. Temporary files that escape deletion by their parent program are easier to delete when they are gathered in their own subdirectory. Windows recommends at least 2MB in the subdirectory pointed to by the TEMP environment variable. If you point TEMP to a RAM disk, you never have to worry about deleting leftover temporary files. They all disappear whenever you reboot or turn off your computer.  windir  Microsoft Windowsadds the windir environment variable whenever you open a DOS win- dow. The windir environment variable always points to the main Windows directory, which is normally C:\WINDOWS. If you issue the SET command to view the variables defined in a DOS window launched from Windows, the list might look like the following: COMSPEC=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM PROMPT=$P$G PATH=C:\BAT;C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;C:\UTIL TEMP=C:\TEMP TMP=C:\TEMP windir=C:\WINDOWS  Windows adds the windir variable to the environment in lowercase letters to keep you from modifying or deleting it. If you issue a SET windir= command, SET capitalizes the variable name before searching for it, and a new variable named WINDIR is created.  WINPMT  If the WINPMT variable is defined, Microsoft Windows uses it to format the DOS prompt dis- played in a DOS window. Using a different DOS prompt from Windows can help you remember that Windows is running and that you need to type EXIT and quit Windows by pressing Alt+F4 before shutting off your computer.  To use the WINPMT environment variable, define WINPMT with the SET command  perhaps in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file  before you start Microsoft Windows. Set WINPMT equal to the prompt you want to use from Windows, using the same formatting you use with the PROMPT command.   For example, you can define the Windows prompt as a simple reminder: SET WINPMT=**Windows** $P$G  This results in the following prompt in a DOS window: **Windows** C:\DOS>  Use the following if you prefer a more direct reminder of how to close a DOS window: SET  WINPMT=**Type EXIT to return to Windows** $P$G  This results in the following prompt in a DOS window: **Type EXIT to return to Windows** C:\DOS>  WINPMT  527  App B    APPENDIX  C  DOS Messages In this appendix  General DOS Messages 530  DOS Device Error Messages 537   530  Appendix C DOS Messages  General DOS Messages  DOS messages can be divided into two groups: general error messages and device error messages. The three types of general DOS messages are as follows:    Error messages—These messages indicate that DOS has encountered a problem with a command or with the syntax you used. Execution stops when DOS displays an error message.    Warning messages—These messages tell you that the next action you take might cause  unwanted changes to files or to your system; they often include a prompt, which enables you to select an action.    Information messages—These messages display needed information about your sys-  tem’s operation or your DOS version’s performance. Like warning messages, these mes- sages also often include a prompt.  The messages in this section might appear any time during a work session. Messages that can occur when you start DOS are indicated by  startup . With most startup errors, DOS does not start and you must reboot the system: d contains n non-contiguous blocks  Warning: CHKDSK found noncontiguous blocks on drive d. If you like, you can use a defragmenter to eliminate the fragmentation or use COPY or XCOPY to transfer the frag- mented files to a freshly formatted floppy disk in a sequential form.  A BAD UMB number has been specified  Error: You have attempted to use LOADHIGH  or LH  with the  L parameter referring to a nonexistent UMB area. The best way to correct this problem is to rerun MemMaker.  A program was run that took memory that Backup requires The program must be removed from memory before Backup can continue  Error: You have installed a terminate-and-stay resident program  TSR  that leaves insufficient memory for BACKUP. Examples are PRINT or some forms of MODE. The resi- dent program must be unloaded before you can continue the backup. Use MEM  C to see which TSR was loaded last.  Access denied  Active code page: xxx  Error: You or a program attempted to change or erase a file that is in use or marked as read-only. You can change the read-only attribute by using the ATTRIB command.  Information: You issued CHCP, which displayed the code page currently in use by the system  represented by xxx .  Active code page for device ddd is xxx  Information: You issued MODE, which lists the code page  xxx  currently in use for the device  ddd . To display a single screen at a time, pipe this command into MORE  MODEMORE .   General DOS Messages  531  App C  Active code page not available from CON device  Error: You used KEYB with a code page not supported on the CON device  screen .  Add filename?  Y N   Adding filename  Prompt: You issued REPLACE  P. DOS asks whether you want to add the file to the disk.  Information: REPLACE displays this message while adding filename to your disk.  All available space in the Extended DOS Partition is assigned to logical drives  Error: No room remains for logical drives in the extended partition. Use FDISK to change the size of the extended partition.  All files canceled by operator  Information: You issued PRINT  T, which removes all files from the print queue.  All files in directory will be deleted! Are you sure  Y N ?  Warning: You issued DEL or ERASE with the *.* wildcard. To continue, press Y; to can- cel, press N. Then press the Enter key.  All logical drives deleted in the Extended DOS Partition  Information: While using FDISK, you removed all logical drives associated with the extended DOS partition.  All specified file s  are contiguous  Information: None of the files you specified  to CHKDSK  are fragmented.  Allocation error, size adjusted  Warning: The contents of a file have been truncated because the size indicated in the directory is inconsistent with the amount of data allocated to the file. Use SCANDISK or CHKDSK  F to correct the discrepancy.  An incompatible DOSKey is already installed  Error: The version of DOSKey you are trying to run is incompatible with the one in memory. Make sure you don’t mix the DOSKEY.COM that comes with DOS 6.0 with the version that comes with DOS 6.2 or another vendor’s command-line editor.  ANSI.SYS must be installed to perform requested function  Warning: While using MODE, you requested a screen function that cannot be performed until you load ANSI.SYS.  APPEND already installed  Information: You tried to issue APPEND with  X or  E after previously using APPEND. You can use the  E switch only the first time you type APPEND after starting your system. You can use the  X switch only if it was used during initialization.   532  Appendix C DOS Messages  APPEND ASSIGN conflict  Warning: You cannot use APPEND on an assigned drive. Cancel the drive assignment before using APPEND with this drive.  ATTENTION: A serious disk error has occurred while writing to drive  Error: SMARTDRV has detected a hard disk error when write caching was enabled. Because the application might have already continued with something else, the usual corrections don’t apply. Write caching must be enabled for only reliable media.   B invalid with a black and white printer  Error: You tried to print the background color by using GRAPHICS  B, but you do not have a color printer connected to your computer.  ***Backing up files to drive x:***  Information: This message appears while you back up files to the specified drive.  Bad command or file name  Error: You entered an invalid name for invoking a command, program, or batch file. The most frequent causes are misspelling a name, omitting a required disk drive or pathname, or omitting the command name when giving parameters  for example, omitting the WordStar command, WS, by typing MYFILE instead of WS MYFILE . Check the spelling on the command line and make sure that the command, program, or batch file is in the location specified. Then, try the command again.  Bad or missing command interpreter  Error  startup : DOS does not start because it cannot find COMMAND.COM, the command interpreter. If this message appears during startup, COMMAND.COM is not on the startup disk or a  COMMAND.COM file from a previous version of DOS is on the disk. If you used the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS, the message means that the SHELL command is improperly phrased or that COMMAND.COM is not in the location you specified. With DOS 6.0 or 6.2, you can override CONFIG.SYS by using the F8 or F5 key while booting. This solution works if the correct COMMAND.COM is in the root directory. Otherwise, place another disk that contains the operating system  IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM  in the floppy disk drive and reset the system. After DOS starts, copy COMMAND.COM to the original startup disk so that you can boot DOS in the future. Error: If this message appears while you are running DOS, there are several possibili- ties: COMMAND.COM has been erased from the disk and directory you used when starting DOS, a version of COMMAND.COM from a previous version of DOS has overwritten the good version, or the COMSPEC entry in the environment has been changed. You must restart DOS by resetting the system. If resetting the system does not solve your problem, restart the computer from a copy of your DOS master disk. Copy COMMAND.COM from this disk to the offending disk.   General DOS Messages  533  Bad or missing filename  Warning  startup : The device driver filename was not found, an error occurred when the device driver was loaded, a break address for the device driver was beyond the RAM available to the computer, or DOS detected an error while loading the driver into memory. DOS continues booting without the device driver filename. If DOS loads, check your CONFIG.SYS file for the line DEVICE=filename. Make sure that the line is typed correctly and that the device driver is at the specified location; then reboot the system. If the message reappears, copy the file from its original disk to the boot disk and try starting DOS again. If the error persists, the device driver is bad; contact the dealer or publisher who sold you the driver.  Bad or missing keyboard definition file  Warning: DOS cannot find KEYBOARD.SYS as specified by the KEYB command. Solving this problem might take several steps. First, check to make sure that KEYBOARD.SYS exists and is in the correct path; then retype the KEYB command. If you get the same message, KEYB.COM or KEYBOARD.SYS might be corrupted.  Bad partition table  Batch file missing  Error: While using FORMAT, DOS was unable to find a DOS partition on the fixed disk you specified. Run FDISK and create a DOS partition on this fixed-disk drive.  Error: DOS could not find the batch file it was processing. The batch file might have been erased or renamed. With DOS 3.0 only, the disk containing the batch file might have been changed, causing DOS to abort processing of the batch file. If you are using DOS 3.0 and you changed the disk that contains the batch file, restart the batch file without changing the disk. You might need to edit the batch file so that you do not need to change disks. This procedure applies only to DOS 3.0. If the batch file includes a RENAME command that causes the originating batch filename to change, edit the batch file to prevent renaming when the batch file is processed again. If the file was erased, re-create the batch file from its backup file if possible. Edit the file to ensure that the batch file does not erase itself.  Error: When using MODE COMx commands to set any COM port parameters, you must at least indicate the baud rate.  Baud rate required  BREAK is off  BREAK is on  Information: When you use BREAK by itself, one of these messages displays the current BREAK setting. You can set BREAK at the command line or in CONFIG.SYS.  App C   534  Appendix C DOS Messages  Cannot change BUFSIZE  Error: When DOSKey has been loaded into memory, you cannot change the buffer size.  Cannot CHDIR to path - tree past this point not processed  Error: CHKDSK was unable to go to the specified directory. No subdirectories below this directory are verified. Run SCANDISK or CHKDSK  F to correct this error.  Cannot CHDIR to root  Error: CHKDSK was checking the tree structure of the directory and was unable to return to the root directory. Remaining subdirectories were not checked. Restart DOS. If the message continues to appear, the disk is unusable and must be refor- matted.  Cannot CHKDSK a network drive  Warning: You cannot use CHKDSK to check drives redirected over the network.  Cannot CHKDSK a SUBSTed or ASSIGNed drive  Warning: You cannot use CHKDSK to check substituted or assigned drives.  Cannot create a zero size partition  Error: While using FDISK, you tried to create a partition of 0%  0 megabytes . To cor- rect this error, you must allocate 1%  or a minimum of 1MB  of hard disk space to any partition you create.  Cannot create extended DOS partition without primary DOS partition on disk x  Error: While using FDISK, you tried to create an extended DOS partition before giv- ing your first fixed-disk drive a primary DOS partition. To correct this problem, sim- ply create a DOS partition on your first fixed-disk drive. When this operation is complete, you can create an extended DOS partition if you have room on this disk or if you have a second fixed disk.  Cannot create logical DOS drive without an Extended DOS Partition on the current drive  Error: When using FDISK, you must create an extended DOS partition before you can create a logical drive.  Cannot DISKCOMP to or from a network drive  Error: You cannot compare disks on any disk drive that has been reassigned to a net- work.  Cannot delete Extended DOS Partition while logical drives exist  Error: When using FDISK to delete an extended DOS partition, you first must remove any logical drives.   General DOS Messages  535  Cannot DISKCOPY to or from a network drive  Error: You attempted to copy a floppy disk to a drive that was redirected to a comput- er network. DISKCOPY does not copy disks directly to a networked disk drive. Use COPY to copy the disk.  Cannot do binary reads from a device  Error: You tried to copy from a device by using the  B switch. To complete the copy process, use the ASCII   A  switch to create an ASCII copy. You also can use the COPY command without the  B switch.  Error: EDIT.COM or HELP.COM cannot find the QBASIC.EXE program file. QBASIC must be available to edit a file or access the MS-DOS online help system.  Cannot find file QBASIC.EXE  Cannot find GRAPHICS profile  Cannot find System files  Error: You did not give the path of the GRAPHICS.PRO file; DOS could not find it in the current directory.  App C  Error: While running FORMAT, you specified a drive that did not have the system files in the root directory.  Cannot FORMAT a network drive  Error: You tried to format a disk in a drive being used by a network.  Cannot FORMAT an ASSIGNed or SUBSTed drive  Error: You attempted to format a drive that was mapped to another drive with ASSIGN or SUBST. To perform a successful format, you must run ASSIGN or SUBST again to clear the drive assignments.  Cannot LABEL a JOINed, SUBSTed or ASSIGNed drive  Error: You attempted to label a drive created with JOIN, SUBST, or ASSIGN.  Cannot LABEL a network drive  Error: You cannot use LABEL with drives redirected over the network.  Cannot load COMMAND, system halted  Error: DOS attempted to reload COMMAND.COM, but the area where DOS keeps track of memory was destroyed or the command processor was not found in the directory specified by the COMSPEC= entry. The system halts. This message might indicate that COMMAND.COM was erased from the disk and directory you used when starting DOS, or that the COMSPEC= entry in the environment has been changed. Restart DOS from your usual startup disk. If DOS does not start, the copy of COMMAND.COM has been erased. Restart DOS from the DOS startup or master disk and copy COMMAND.COM to your usual startup disk.   536  Appendix C DOS Messages  Alternatively, an errant program might have corrupted the memory allocation table where DOS tracks available memory. Try running the same program that was in the computer when the system halted. If the problem occurs again, the program is defec- tive. Contact the dealer or publisher who sold you the program.  Cannot loadhigh batch file  Warning: The LOADHIGH  or LH  command is used only for TSR programs. Batch files might not be run this way.  Cannot move multiple files to a single file  Error: When using MOVE with wildcards for the source file specification, you must specify a directory for the destination. The most common cause of this error is a mis- spelled name.  Cannot perform a cyclic copy  Error: When using XCOPY  S, you cannot specify a target that is a subdirectory of the source. You might use a temporary disk or file to bypass this limitation if the directory tree structure allows a temporary disk or file.  Cannot recover ... entry Entry has a bad attribute  or link or size   Error, Warning: The .. entry  the parent directory  is defective and cannot be recov- ered. If you have specified the  F switch, CHKDSK tries to correct the error.  Cannot set up expanded memory  Cannot specify default drive  Error: FASTOPEN cannot correctly access expanded memory  EMS .  Error: You specified the default drive as a SYS destination. Switch to another drive before issuing the SYS command.  Cannot start COMMAND, exiting  Error: You or one of your programs directed DOS to load another copy of COMMAND.COM, but DOS could not load it. Your CONFIG.SYS FILES command is set too low, or you do not have enough free memory for another copy of COMMAND.COM. If your system has 256KB or more and FILES is less than 10, edit the CONFIG.SYS file on your startup disk, using FILES=15 or FILES=20. Then., restart DOS. If the problem recurs, you do not have enough memory in your computer, or you have too many resident or background programs competing for memory space. Restart DOS, loading only the essential programs. If necessary, eliminate unneeded device drivers or RAM disk software. You also can obtain additional RAM for your system.  Cannot SUBST a network drive  Error: You cannot substitute drives redirected over the network.   General DOS Messages  537  Cannot SYS a network drive  Cannot use FASTOPEN for drive x  Error: You cannot transfer system files to drives redirected over the network.  Error: You attempted to use FASTOPEN over a network, with a floppy disk drive, or with more than four disks at one time.  Cannot use PRINT - Use NET PRINT  Error: You tried to use PRINT over the network. Use NET PRINT or consult your system administrator for the correct procedure for printing files over the network.  Cannot XCOPY from a reserved device  Cannot XCOPY to a reserved device  Error: The specified XCOPY source or target is a character device  printer , an asyn- chronous communication device, or NULL. You must specify a file or block device as your source and your target.  CHDIR .. failed, trying alternate method  Warning: CHKDSK was unable to return to a parent directory while checking the tree structure. CHKDSK attempts to return to the parent directory by starting over at the root and repeating the search.  App C  Code page not prepared  Error: While using MODE, you selected a code page not yet prepared for the system or without the correct font to support the current video mode. To correct this error,  prepare a code page using the MODE PREPARE command. If you have installed the  DISPLAY.SYS installable device driver, make sure that the DEVICE command line in your CONFIG.SYS file allows additional subfonts.  Code page xxx  Information: This message displays the code page currently in use by the specified device. If you type MODE CON, for example, the message returns the code page in use for your screen.  Code page xxx not prepared for all devices  Error: While using CHCP, you selected a code page not currently supported by a device. To correct this error, first make sure that your device supports code page switching and that it is online. Then issue the MODE PREPARE command to ready the device for the code page. You are ready to retry CHCP.  Code page xxx not prepared for system  Error: CHCP is unable to select a code page for the system. If NLSFUNC is installed and your CONFIG.SYS file does not install device drivers, you can retry CHCP. If CONFIG.SYS installs device drivers, you must issue the MODE PREPARE command to prepare the spe- cific code page for each device before retrying the CHCP command.   538  Appendix C DOS Messages  Code page operation not supported on this device  Error: While using MODE, you selected a device and code page combination not recog- nized by DOS. Make sure that you specified a valid device and code page and that the code page you selected is supported on the device.  Code page requested  xxx  is not valid for given keyboard code  Error: You selected an incompatible keyboard code and code page combination. Re- enter the KEYB command with a valid keyboard code and code page.  Code page specified has not been prepared  Error: You issued the KEYB command with an unrecognized code page. Prepare the code page for your CON  console screen device  by using the MODE PREPARE command; then retry KEYB.  Code page specified is inconsistent with selected code page  Warning: You used KEYB with an option incompatible with the code page for your con- sole screen device. Specify a compatible option or issue the MODE SELECT command to change the code page for your console screen device.  Code pages cannot be prepared  Error: You attempted to use a duplicate code page for the specified device; or with MODE PREPARE, you specified more code pages than DOS supports for that device. Check CONFIG.SYS to see how many prepared code pages your device command line allows or issue MODE  STATUS at the command line to view the code pages already pre- pared for the device  for example, MODE  STATUS CON .  Compare error at offset xxxxxxxx  Information: The files you are comparing are not the same. The difference occurs xxxxxxxx bytes from the beginning of the file. The number of bytes and the values for the differing bytes are given in hexadecimal format  base 16 .  Compare error on side s, track t  Information: DISKCOMP has located a difference on the disk in the specified drive on side s at track t. Compare process ended  Error: A fatal error occurred during the comparison operation.  Comparing t tracks n sectors per track, s side s   Information: This message confirms the format of the disks you are comparing.  Configuration too large for memory  Error  startup : DOS could not load because you set too many files or buffers in your CONFIG.SYS file or specified too large an environment area   E  with the SHELL com- mand. This problem occurs only on systems with less than 256KB.   General DOS Messages  539  Restart DOS with a different configuration; then edit the CONFIG.SYS file on your boot disk, lowering the number of files, buffers, or both. You also can edit CONFIG.SYS to reduce the size of the environment in addition to or as an alternative to lowering the number of files and buffers. Restart DOS with the edited disk. Another alternative is to increase the RAM in your system.  Content of destination lost before copy  Error: The original contents of the destination file for the COPY  concatenation  opera- tion were overwritten because the destination and one of the source files had the same name. You might be able to recover the file by using UNDELETE; if not, you can restore the destination file from your backup disk.  Copy process ended  Error: The DISKCOPY process ended before completion. Test with SCANDISK or CHKDSK and then copy the remaining files onto the disk with COPY or XCOPY.  Current code page settings:  Information: You issued the MODE command and specified a device with code page sup- port. MODE displays the active code page, the hardware code page, other prepared code pages, and the space available for additional code pages on the lines that follow the message. If you want to see status information for all devices, type MODE without listing a device.  Current CON code page: xxx  Information: This message displays the current keyboard code and code page along with the current code page used by the console screen device  CON .  Current drive is no longer valid  Warning: The system prompt includes the meta-symbol $p, to display the current directory, or $n, to display the current drive. You tried to change the default drive to an invalid drive.  You tried to make a floppy drive current, for example, without a floppy present.  DOS presented the Abort, Retry, Fail? prompt. When you responded by pressing F, DOS temporarily changed the prompt to the Current drive is no longer valid message. The invalid drive error also occurs when a current networked or substituted disk drive is deleted or disconnected. Simply change the current drive to a valid disk drive.  Current keyboard does not support this code page  Error: You selected a code page incompatible with the current keyboard code. First, check the selected code page. If the code page is correct, change the keyboard code by using KEYB.  Device n not prepared  Error: No code page is present for this device.  App C   540  Appendix C DOS Messages  Disk boot failure  Error  startup : An error occurred when DOS tried to load into memory. The disk contained IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS, but one of the two files could not be loaded. Try starting DOS from the disk again. If the error recurs, try starting DOS from a disk you know is good, such as a copy of your DOS startup or master disk. If DOS still fails to boot, you have a disk drive problem. Contact your dealer.  Disk full. Edits lost.  Error: EDLIN cannot save your work to disk because the designated disk is full. Always make sure that you have a disk with plenty of room to save your files.  Disk unsuitable for system disk  Warning: FORMAT detected one or more bad sectors on the floppy disk in the area where DOS normally resides. Because the portion of the disk where DOS must reside is unusable, you cannot boot DOS from this disk. Try reformatting the disk. Some floppy disks format successfully the second time. If FORMAT gives this message again, you cannot boot from the disk.  Divide overflow  Error: DOS aborted a program that attempted to divide by zero. The program was incorrectly entered or contains a logic flaw. If you wrote the program, correct the error and try the program again. If you purchased the program, report the problem  to the dealer or publisher. This message also might appear when you attempt to format a RAM disk with DOS 3.0 or 3.1. Make sure that you are formatting the correct disk and try again.  Do not specify filename s  Command format: DISKCOMP [drive1: [drive2:]] [ 1] [ 8]  Error: You typed an incorrect switch or added one or more filenames with the DISKCOMP command. DISKCOMP syntax does not accept filenames on the command line.  Do not specify filename s  Command Format: DISKCOPY [drive1: [drive2:]] [ 1] [ V]  Error: You added an incorrect switch to the command or placed a filename in the command string. Retype the command and press Enter.  DOS is in HMA  DOS is in low memory  Information: Most of the DOS system can be optionally loaded above the first megabyte in the high memory area  HMA , if you have at least a 286, have some avail- able extended memory, and use the DOS=HIGH parameter in CONFIG.SYS. These mes- sages tell you whether DOS is in HMA.   General DOS Messages  541  DOS memory-arena error  Error: When you are using the DOS editor, this message indicates a serious memory error. If possible, save your work to a different file and reboot your computer.  Drive assignment syntax error  Error: INTERLNK found a syntax error in its command line. Double-check the syntax by entering HELP INTERLNK.  Drive types or diskette types not compatible  Error: When using DISKCOMP or DISKCOPY, you specified two drives of different capaci- ties. You cannot use DISKCOMP or DISKCOPY, for example, from a 1.2MB drive to a 360KB drive. Retype the command using compatible drives.  Duplicate filename or file not found  Error: While using RENAME  or REN , you attempted to change a filename to a name that already exists, or the file to be renamed did not exist in the directory. Check the directory to make sure that the filename exists and that you have spelled it correctly. Then try again.  App C  Enter current volume label for drive d:  Warning: You are attempting to format a hard disk that has a volume label. Enter the exact volume label to proceed with the format; if you do not want to enter a volume label, press Enter and FORMAT will quit.  Error in COUNTRY command  Warning  startup : The COUNTRY command in CONFIG.SYS is improperly phrased or has an incorrect country code or code page number. DOS continues to load but uses the default information for the COUNTRY command. After DOS has started, check the COUNTRY line in your CONFIG.SYS file. Make sure that the command is correctly phrased  with commas between the country code, code page, and COUNTRY.SYS file  and that any given information is correct. If you detect an error in the line, edit the line, save the file, and restart DOS. If you do not find an error, restart DOS. If the same message appears, edit CONFIG.SYS. Re-enter the COUNTRY command and delete the old COUNTRY line. The old line might contain some nonsense characters that DOS can see but that are not appar- ent to your text-editing program.  Error in EXE file  Error: DOS detected an error while attempting to load a program stored in an EXE file. The problem, which is in the relocation information DOS needs to load the pro- gram, might occur if the EXE file has been altered. Restart DOS and try the program again, this time using a backup copy of the pro- gram. If the message appears again, the program is flawed. If you are using a pur- chased program, contact the dealer or publisher. If you wrote the program, issue LINK to produce another copy of the program.   542  Appendix C DOS Messages  Error loading operating system  Error  startup : A disk error occurred when DOS was loading from the hard disk. DOS does not start. Restart the computer. If the error occurs after several tries, restart DOS from the floppy disk drive. If the hard disk does not respond  that is, you cannot run DIR or CHKDSK without getting an error , you have a problem with the hard disk. Contact your dealer. If the hard disk does respond, place another copy of DOS on your hard disk by using SYS. You also might need to copy COMMAND.COM to the hard disk. Increase to 15 or 20 the number of FILES in the CONFIG.SYS file of your startup disk. Restart DOS. If the error recurs, you might have a problem with the disk. Try a back- up copy of the program. If the backup works, copy the backup over the offending file. If an error occurs in the copying process, you have a flawed disk. If the problem is a floppy disk, copy the files from the flawed disk to another disk and reformat or discard the original disk. If the problem is the hard disk, immediately back up your files and run RECOVER on the offending file. If the problem persists, your hard disk might be damaged.  Error reading directory  Error: During a FORMAT procedure, DOS was unable to read the directory; bad sectors might have developed in the file allocation table  FAT  structure. If the message occurs when DOS is reading a floppy disk, the disk is unusable and should be thrown away. If DOS cannot read your hard disk, however, the problem is more serious, and you might have to reformat your disk. Remember to back up your data files regularly to prevent major losses.  Error reading  or writing  partition table  Error: DOS could not read from  or write to  the disk’s partition table during the  FORMAT operation because the partition table is corrupted. Run FDISK on the disk and reformat the disk.  Error writing to file on remote system  Error: INTERSVR has detected that the remote system  the one running INTERLNK  has a write error. The most likely reason is that the remote disk is full.  Extended error  Error: COMMAND.COM has detected an error but cannot tell you the normal error message because the disk containing COMMAND.COM is missing.  This error doesn’t generally occur on a hard disk system.  To avoid these anonymous errors, use the  MSG switch  on the SHELL= line of CONFIG.SYS. File allocation table bad, drive d Abort, Retry, Fail?  Warning: DOS encountered a problem in the file allocation table of the disk in drive d. Press R to retry several times; if the message recurs, press A to abort.   General DOS Messages  543  CHKDSK can’t repair this type of error in the file allocation table. If you have DOS 6.2, SCANDISK might be capable of correcting this problem for you. Commercial third- party utility packages often include tools that can repair this problem as well. Otherwise, you will be forced to back up as many files as you can and then reformat the disk. If FORMAT finds no errors, you can safely go back to using the disk.  File cannot be copied onto itself  Error: You attempted to copy a file to a disk and directory containing the same file- name. This error often occurs when you misspell or omit parts of the source or desti- nation drive, path, or filename. This error might occur also when you are using wildcard characters for filenames or when you use SUBST. Check your spelling and the source and destination names, and then try the command again.  File creation error  Error: A program or DOS failed to add a new file to the directory or to replace an existing file. If the file already exists, issue the ATTRIB command to check whether the file is marked as read-only. If the read-only flag is set and you want to change or erase the file, remove the read-only flag with ATTRIB; then try again. If the problem occurs when the read-only flag is not set, run SCANDISK or CHKDSK without the  F switch to determine whether the directory is full, the disk is full, or some other problem exists with the disk.  App C  File not found  Error: DOS could not find the specified file. The file is not on the current disk or directory, or you specified the disk drive name, pathname, or filename incorrectly. Check these possibilities and try the command again.  Filename device driver cannot be initialized  Warning  startup : In CONFIG.SYS, the parameters in the device driver filename or the syntax of the DEVICE line is incorrect. Check for incorrect parameters and phrasing errors in the DEVICE line. Edit the DEVICE line in the CONFIG.SYS file, save the file, and restart DOS.  FIRST diskette bad or incompatible  SECOND diskette bad or incompatible  Error: One of these messages might appear when you issue DISKCOMP. The messages indicate that the FIRST  source  or the SECOND  target  floppy disk is unreadable or that the disks you are attempting to compare have different format densities.  Format not supported on drive x:  Error: You cannot use the FORMAT command on the specified drive. If you entered device driver parameters that your computer cannot support, DOS displays this mes- sage. Check CONFIG.SYS for bad DEVICE or DRIVPARM commands.   544  Appendix C DOS Messages  Formatting while copying  Illegal device name  Incorrect DOS version  Information: DISKCOPY displays this message as it copies data to an unformatted disk.  Error: DOS does not recognize the device name you entered with the MODE command.  Error: The copy of the file holding the command you just entered is from a different version of DOS. Get a copy of the command from the correct version of DOS  usually from your copy of the DOS startup or master disk  and try the command again. If the disk you are using has been updated to hold new versions of DOS, copy the new versions over the old ones.  Insert disk with batch file and strike any key when ready  Prompt: DOS attempted to execute the next command from a batch file, but the disk holding the batch file is not in the disk drive. This message occurs for DOS 3.1 and later versions. DOS 3.0 gives a fatal error when the disk is changed.  Insert disk with batch file into disk drive, and press a key to continue  Insert disk with \COMMAND.COM in drive d and strike any key when ready  Prompt: DOS needs to reload COMMAND.COM but cannot find it on the startup disk. If you are using floppy disks, the disk in drive d  usually A  has probably been changed. Place a disk with a good copy of COMMAND.COM in drive d and press a key.  Insert diskette for drive x and press any key when ready  Prompt: On a system with one floppy disk drive or a system in which DRIVER.SYS cre- ates more than one logical disk drive from a physical disk drive, you or one of your programs specified a tandem disk drive x  such as A or B  that is different from the current disk drive. If the correct disk is in the disk drive, press a key. Otherwise, insert the correct disk into the floppy disk drive and then press a key.  Insufficient disk space  Warning, Error: The disk does not have enough free space to hold the file being writ- ten. All DOS programs terminate when this problem occurs, but some non-DOS pro- grams continue. If you think that the disk should have enough room to hold the file, run SCANDISK or CHKDSK to determine whether the disk has a problem. When you terminate programs early by pressing Ctrl+Break, DOS might not be capable of doing the necessary cleanup work, leaving some disk space temporarily trapped. SCANDISK or CHKDSK can free these areas. If you have simply run out of disk space, free some disk space or insert a different disk; then try the command again.   General DOS Messages  545  Insufficient memory to store macro. Use the DOSKEY command with the  BUFSIZE switch to increase available memory.  Warning: Your DOSKey macros have filled the total space set aside for them. You must enlarge the memory area for macros  the default is 512 bytes  by using the  BUFSIZE switch before you can enter any new macros.  Intermediate file error during pipe  Error: DOS cannot create or write to one or both of the intermediate files it uses when piping information between programs because the disk is full, the root directory of the current disk is full, or the TEMP environment variable points to an illegal path. The most frequent cause is insufficient disk space. Run DIR on the root directory of the current disk drive to make sure that you have enough room in the root directory for two additional files. If you do not have enough room, make room by deleting or copying and deleting files. You also can copy the necessary files to a different disk that has sufficient room. This error also might occur if a program is deleting files, including the temporary files DOS creates. In this case, correct the program, contact the dealer or program publish- er, or avoid using the program with piping.  App C  Internal stack overflow System halted  Error: Your programs and DOS have exhausted the stack, which is the memory space reserved for temporary use. This problem is usually caused by a rapid succession of hardware devices demanding attention. DOS stops, and the system must be turned off and on again to restart DOS. The circumstances that cause this message are generally infrequent and erratic, and they might not recur. If you want to prevent this error from occurring, add the STACKS command to your CONFIG.SYS file. If the command is already in your CONFIG.SYS file, increase the number of stacks specified.  Invalid  BAUD parameter  Warning: You have selected an illegal baud rate for either INTERLNK or INTERSVR. For example, you have  BAUD:9200 instead of  BAUD:9600.  Invalid characters in volume label  Error: You attempted to enter more than 11 alphanumeric characters, or you entered illegal characters  +, =,  , \ , and , for example  when you typed the disk’s volume label  the disk name . Retype the volume label with valid characters.  Invalid COMMAND.COM in drive d:  Warning: DOS tried to reload COMMAND.COM from the disk in drive d and found that the file was from a different version of DOS. Follow the instructions for inserting a disk with the correct version.   546  Appendix C DOS Messages  If you frequently use the disk that generated this warning message, copy the correct version of COMMAND.COM to that disk.  Invalid COMMAND.COM, system halted  Error: DOS could not find COMMAND.COM on the hard disk. DOS halts and must be restarted. COMMAND.COM might have been erased, or the COMSPEC variable in the environment might have been changed. Restart the computer from the hard disk. If a message indi- cates that COMMAND.COM is missing, the file was erased. Restart DOS from a floppy disk and copy COMMAND.COM to the root directory of the hard disk or to the location your SHELL command indicates, if you have placed this command in your CONFIG.SYS file. If you restart DOS and this message appears later, a program or batch file is erasing COMMAND.COM or altering the COMSPEC variable. If a program is erasing COMMAND.COM, contact the dealer or publisher who sold you the program. If a batch file is erasing COMMAND.COM, edit the batch file. If COMSPEC is being altered, edit the offending batch file or program, or place COMMAND.COM in the subdirectory your program or batch file expects.  Invalid COUNTRY code or code page  Warning  startup : The COUNTRY code number or the code page number given to the COUNTRY command in CONFIG.SYS is incorrect or incompatible. DOS ignores the COUN- TRY command and continues the startup process. Check the COUNTRY command in your CONFIG.SYS file  see Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS”  to determine whether the correct and compatible country code and code page numbers are specified. If you detect an error, edit and save the file. Then restart DOS.  Invalid date  Error: You gave an impossible date or an invalid character to separate the month, day, and year. This message also appears if you enter the date from the keypad when it is not in numeric mode.  Invalid device parameters from device driver  Error: The partition did not fall on a track boundary. You might have set the DEVICE drivers incorrectly in CONFIG.SYS or attempted to format a hard disk formatted with DOS 2.x so that the total number of hidden sectors is not evenly divisible by the num- ber of sectors on a track. Therefore, the partition might not start on a track boundary. To correct the error, run FDISK before formatting or check CONFIG.SYS for a bad DEVICE or DRIVPARM command.  Invalid directory  Error: You specified a directory name that does not exist, you misspelled the directory name, the directory path is on a different disk, you did not give the path character  \  at the beginning of the name, or you did not separate the directory names with the   General DOS Messages  547  path character. Check your directory names to make sure that the directory exists and try the command again.  Invalid disk change Abort, Retry, Fail?  Warning: A floppy disk was changed while a program had open files to be written to the floppy disk. Place the correct disk in the disk drive and press R to retry. Typically, this check is supported on drives larger than 360KB.  Invalid drive in search path  Warning: You specified an invalid disk drive name in the PATH command, or a disk drive you named is nonexistent or hidden temporarily by a SUBST or JOIN command. Use PATH to check the paths you instructed DOS to search. If you gave a nonexistent disk drive name, issue the PATH command again with the correct search paths. If the problem is temporary because of a SUBST or JOIN command, you can run PATH, leaving out or correcting the wrong entry. Or you can just ignore the warning message.  Invalid drive or file name  Error: You gave the name of a nonexistent disk drive, or you mistyped the disk drive or filename. Remember that certain DOS commands  such as SUBST and JOIN  temporarily hide disk drive names while the command is in effect. Check the disk drive name you gave and try the command again.  Invalid drive specification  Error: You entered an invalid or nonexistent disk drive as a parameter to a command; you specified the same disk drive for the source and destination; or by not giving a parameter, you defaulted to the same disk drive for the source and the destination. Remember that some DOS commands  such as SUBST and JOIN  temporarily hide disk drive names while the command is in effect. Check the disk drive names. If the com- mand is objecting to a missing parameter and defaulting to the wrong disk drive, name the correct disk drive explicitly.  Invalid drive specification Specified drive does not exist or is non-removable  Error: You gave the name of a nonexistent disk drive, you named the hard disk drive when using commands for only floppy disks, you did not give a disk drive name and defaulted to the hard disk when using commands for only floppy disks, or you named or defaulted to a RAM disk drive when using commands for a floppy disk. Remember that certain DOS commands  such as SUBST and JOIN  temporarily hide disk drive names while the command is in effect. Check the disk drive name you gave and try the command again.  App C   548  Appendix C DOS Messages  Invalid keyboard code specified  Error: You selected an invalid code. Enter the KEYB command again with the correct keyboard code.  Invalid macro definition  Error: You entered an illegal character or command with DOSKey or attempted to create a DOSKey macro with an illegal definition. This message appears, for example, if you use a GOTO command in a DOSKey macro. Correct any errors and carefully retype the macro.  Invalid media or Track 0 bad - disk unusable  Error: A disk you are trying to format might be damaged. A disk might not format the first time. Try to format again; if the same message appears, the disk is bad and should be discarded. With some versions of FORMAT, this same symptom can be caused by memory boundary problems. If the symptom occurs for multiple floppy disks, try changing the number or sizes of TSRs to see whether the symptoms change.  Invalid number of parameters  Error: You have given too few or too many parameters to a command. One of the fol- lowing occurred: You omitted required information, you omitted a colon immediately after the disk drive name, you inserted an extra space, you omitted a required space, or you omitted a slash     in front of a switch.  Invalid parameter  Error: At least one parameter you entered for the command is not valid. One of the following occurred: You omitted required information, you omitted a colon immedi- ately after the disk drive name, you inserted an extra space, you omitted a required space, you omitted a slash     in front of a switch, or you used a switch the command does not recognize. For more information, check the explanation of this message in the “Command Reference” for the command you issued.  Invalid parameter combination  You typed conflicting parameters with a DOS command. Retype the command with only one of the conflicting switches.  Invalid partition table  Error  startup : DOS has detected a problem in the hard disk’s partition information. Restart DOS from a floppy disk. Back up all files from the hard disk, if possible, and run FDISK to correct the problem. If you change the partition information, you must reformat the hard disk and restore all its files.  Invalid path  Error: The pathname contains illegal characters, the pathname has more than 63 char- acters, or a directory name within the path is misspelled or does not exist.   General DOS Messages  549  Check the spelling of the pathname. If necessary, check the disk directory with DIR to make sure that the directory you have specified exists and that you have specified the correct pathname. Make sure that the pathname contains no more than 63 characters. If necessary, change the current directory to a directory closer to the file to shorten the pathname.  Invalid path or file name  Error: You gave a directory name or filename that does not exist, specified the wrong directory name  a directory not on the path , or mistyped a name. COPY aborts when it encounters an invalid path or filename. If you specified a wildcard for a filename, COPY transfers all valid files before it issues the error message. Check to see which files have been transferred. Determine whether the directory and filenames are spelled correctly and whether the path is correct. Then try again.  Invalid STACK parameters  Warning  startup : One of the following problems exists with the STACKS command in your CONFIG.SYS file. A comma is missing between the number of stacks and the size of the stack, the number of stack frames is not in the range of 8 to 64, the stack size is not in the range of 32 to 512, you have omitted the number of stack frames or the stack size, or the stack frame or the stack size  but not both  is 0. DOS continues to start but ignores the STACKS command. Check the STACKS command in your CONFIG.SYS file. Edit and save the file; then restart DOS.  App C  Invalid time  Invalid volume ID  Error: You gave an impossible time or invalid character to separate the hours, minutes, and seconds. This message also appears if you enter the time from the keypad when it is not in numeric mode.  Error: When formatting a fixed  or hard  disk, you entered an incorrect volume label, and DOS aborted the format attempt. Type VOL at the DOS prompt and press Enter to view the volume label of the disk; then try the command again.  Memory allocation error Cannot load COMMAND, system halted  Error: A program destroyed the area where DOS keeps track of memory. You must restart DOS. If this error occurs again with the same program, the program has a flaw. Try a backup copy of the program. If the problem persists, contact the dealer or pro- gram publisher.  Missing operating system  Error  startup : The DOS hard disk partition entry is marked as bootable  capable of starting DOS , but the DOS partition does not contain a copy of DOS. DOS does not start.   550  Appendix C DOS Messages  Start DOS from a floppy disk. Issue the SYS C: command to place DOS on the hard disk and then copy COMMAND.COM to the disk. If this command fails to solve the prob- lem, you must back up the existing files, if any, from the hard disk; then issue FORMAT  S to place a copy of the operating system on the hard disk. If necessary, restore the files you backed up.  MSBACKUP program files must be located on your hard disk You cannot start MSBACKUP from a floppy disk  Error: MSBACKUP relies on repeated access to its program files during the backup opera- tion. You must start it from a hard disk so that the program files will be available throughout the process. Change the default drive to the hard disk before starting MSBACKUP.  Must enter both  T and  N parameters  Error: On FORMAT, you must specify  T  number of tracks per side  and  N  number of sectors per disk  on the same command line. If you include the one, you must include the other.  Must specify COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4  Error: You must specify COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4 when using this form of the MODE command.  No drive letters redirected  Information: INTERLNK isn’t currently redirecting any drive letters to the remote  system.  No free file handles Cannot start COMMAND, exiting  Error: DOS could not load an additional copy of COMMAND.COM because no file handles were available. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file on your startup disk to increase by five the number of file handles  using the FILES command . Restart DOS and try the com- mand again.  No printer ports redirected  Information: INTERLNK isn’t currently redirecting any printer ports to the remote  system.  No room for system on destination disk  Error: This error isn’t nearly so prevalent in DOS 6.0 or 6.2 as it was in previous ver- sions. SYS rearranges the files as needed to make a system bootable but issues this error if insufficient room is available or if the root directory is full.  No serial ports were found  Error: You specified the  COM switch on INTERSVR, but no serial ports are available. This problem could occur if a TSR program has taken control of the available port  or if the hardware is configured to an invalid address.   General DOS Messages  551  App C  No system on default drive  Error: SYS cannot find the system files. Insert a disk containing the system files, such as the DOS disk, and type the command again. If the system files are available on another drive, issue the other form of the SYS command, indicating the location of the system files.  Non-System disk or disk error Replace and strike any key when ready  Error  startup : Your disk does not contain IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS, or a read error occurred when you started the system. DOS does not start. If you are using a floppy disk system, insert a bootable disk into drive A and press a key. The most frequent cause of this message on hard disk systems is leaving a non- bootable disk in drive A with the door closed. Open the door to disk drive A and press a key. DOS boots from the hard disk.  Not enough memory  Insufficient memory  Error: The computer does not have enough free RAM to execute the program or command. If you loaded a resident program, such as PRINT, GRAPHICS, SideKick, or ProKey, restart DOS and try the command again before loading any resident pro- grams. If this method fails to solve the problem, remove any nonessential device dri- vers or RAM disk software from CONFIG.SYS and restart DOS. If this option also fails, your computer does not have enough memory for this command. You must increase the amount of RAM installed in your computer to run the command.  Out of environment space  Warning: Not enough room is available in the current environment to add  or change  the variables you have specified with the SET, PATH, or PROMPT command. If you are running SET, PATH, or PROMPT from a shell program such as DOS Shell, quit the shell program and try the command again. If the command still fails, you can increase the size of the environment by increasing the  E:size parameter for the SHELL= command in your CONFIG.SYS file and restarting your computer.  Out of memory  Packed file corrupt  Error: The amount of memory is insufficient to perform the operation you requested. This error occurs in the DOS 5.0 Editor.  Error: The program appears to be damaged. A common cause of this symptom is older format-packed executables, which could not load into the first 64KB of conven- tional memory. With older operating system versions, the resident portion of the sys- tem generally used enough memory that this wasn’t a problem. In DOS 5.0, 6.0, and 6.2, the DOS=HIGH, DEVICEHIGH, and LOADHIGH features can reduce memory usage enough that this problem occurs with certain programs. Use the LOADFIX command to use up enough memory temporarily so that the program is loaded at a location it can manage.   552  Appendix C DOS Messages  Parameters not supported  Parameters not supported by drive  Error: You entered parameters that do not exist, that are not supported by the DOS version you are running, or that are incompatible with the specified disk drive. Run VER to determine whether the current DOS version supports the parameters  or switches  you specified.  Parameters not compatible with fixed disk  Error: A device driver for a hard disk does not support generic IOCtl functions.  Parse Error  Path not found  Path too long  Error: COMMAND.COM has detected an error but cannot tell you the normal error message because the floppy disk containing COMMAND.COM is missing.  This error doesn’t gener- ally occur on a hard disk system.  To avoid these “anonymous” errors, use the  MSG switch on the SHELL= line of CONFIG.SYS.  Error: A specified file or directory path does not exist. You might have misspelled the filename or directory name, or you might have omitted a path character  \  between directory names or between the final directory name and the filename. Another possi- bility is that the file or directory does not exist in the place specified. Check these pos- sibilities and try again.  Error: You have given a pathname that exceeds the DOS 64-character limit, or you omitted a space between filename parameters. Check the command line. If the phras- ing is correct, you must change to a directory closer to the file you want and try the command again.  Program too big to fit in memory  Error: The computer does not have enough memory to load the program or com- mand you invoked. If you have any resident programs loaded  such as PRINT, GRAPHICS, or SideKick , restart DOS and try the command again without loading the resident programs. If this message appears again, reduce the number of buffers  BUFFERS  in the CONFIG.SYS file, eliminate nonessential device drivers or RAM disk software, and restart DOS. If the problem persists, your computer does not have enough RAM for the program or command. You must increase the amount of RAM in your computer to run the program.  Required parameter missing  Error: Many DOS commands give this error when you omit part of the parameter list. You might have specified only a single name with the MOVE command, for example.   General DOS Messages  553  Same parameter entered twice  Error: You duplicated a switch when you typed a command. Retype the command using the parameter only once.  Sector size too large in file filename  Error: The device driver filename that you are loading in your CONFIG.SYS file with a DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= command uses a sector size that is too large. You cannot use this device driver.  SOURCE diskette bad or incompatible  Error: The disk you attempted to read during a copy process was damaged or in the wrong format  for example, a high-density disk in a double-density disk drive . DOS cannot read the disk.  Specified COM port number not recognized by BIOS  Error: The port number is legal, but your ROM BIOS doesn’t support it. Generally, this problem can happen with an older BIOS that supports only two COM ports. Either replace the computer’s ROM BIOS or specify COM1 or COM2.  App C  Syntax error  Error: You phrased a command improperly by omitting needed information, giving extraneous information, inserting an extra space into a file or pathname, or using an incorrect switch. Check the command line for these possibilities and try the command again.  Target diskette bad or incompatible  Target diskette may be unusable  Target diskette unusable  Error: A problem exists with the target disk. DOS does not recognize the format of the target disk in the drive, or the disk is defective. Make sure that the target disk is the same density as the source disk, run SCANDISK or CHKDSK on the target disk to determine the problem, or try to reformat the disk before proceeding with the disk copy operation.  Target media has lower capacity than Source Continue anyway  Y N ?  Warning: The target disk can hold fewer bytes of data than the source disk. The most likely cause is bad sectors on the target disk. If you press Y, some data on the source disk might not fit on the target disk. To avoid the possibility of an incomplete transfer of data, press N and insert a disk with the same capacity as the source disk. If you are not copying “hidden” files, you also can issue the COPY *.* command to transfer files.   554  Appendix C DOS Messages  There are no serial ports or parallel ports available for communication  Error: INTRSVR cannot find any serial ports or parallel ports not already in use. Without such a port, INTRSVR cannot communicate with INTRLNK.  There is not enough room to create a restore file You will not be able to use the unformat utility Proceed with Format  Y N ?  Warning: The disk lacks sufficient room to create a restore file. Without this file, you cannot use UNFORMAT to reverse the format you are attempting.  This program requires Microsoft Windows  Error: At the DOS prompt, you tried to run a program that needs Microsoft Windows to execute. If you are already running Windows, press Alt+Tab to switch to the Program Manager and start it from there. If you haven’t started Windows, use WIN to do so.  Too many block devices  Warning  startup : Your CONFIG.SYS file contains too many DEVICE commands. DOS continues to start but does not install additional device drivers. DOS can handle only 26 block devices. The block devices created by the DEVICE com- mands plus the number of block devices automatically created by DOS exceed this number. Remove any unnecessary DEVICE commands from your CONFIG.SYS file and restart DOS.  Too many parallel ports, port ignored  Warning: INTERLNK cannot automatically scan this many parallel ports. The earlier ones will be used.  Too many serial ports, port ignored  Warning: INTERLNK cannot automatically scan this many serial ports. The earlier ones will be used.  Top level process aborted, cannot continue  Error  startup : COMMAND.COM or another DOS command detected a disk error, and you chose the A  abort  option. DOS cannot finish starting itself, and the system halts. Try to start DOS again. If the error recurs, start DOS from a floppy disk  if starting from the hard disk  or from a different floppy disk  if starting from a floppy disk . After DOS has started, issue the SYS command to place another copy of the operating system on the disk and copy COMMAND.COM to the disk. If DOS reports an error while copying, the disk is bad. Reformat or discard the floppy disk or back up and reformat the hard disk.  Trying to recover allocation unit nnn  Information, Warning: A bad allocation unit was found when the FORMAT command executed.   General DOS Messages  555  Unable to create destination  Unable to create directory  Error: MOVE was unable to create the destination file. Possible reasons are that the des- tination drive is full or that the destination is the root directory, which lacks room.  Error: You or a program could not create a directory for one of the following reasons. A directory by the same name already exists; a file by the same name already exists; you are adding a directory to the root directory, and the root directory is full; or the directory name has illegal characters or is a device name. Issue DIR to make sure that no file or directory already exists with the same name. If you are adding the directory to the root directory, remove or move  copy and then erase  any nonessential files or directories. Check the spelling of the directory name and make sure that the command is properly phrased.  Unable to initialize serial port COMn  Error: INTRSVR was unable to initialize the specified serial port. The most common reason is that two devices in the system have the same port address.  Unable to load MS-DOS Shell, Retry  y n ?  App C  Error, Prompt: DOSSHELL.COM could not load DOSSHELL.EXE. Normally, this error is caused by not having enough conventional memory. If you are attempting to run DOSSHELL from another program, quit the program and try again. A less likely cause for this error message is that the DOSSHELL.EXE file is corrupted. If you have plenty of conventional memory available  MEM  FREE , get a fresh copy of DOSSHELL.EXE from a backup disk.  Unable to open source  Unable to read source  Unable to write BOOT  Error: MOVE was unable to open the specified source file. This problem could be the result of an illegal character used in the filename, but the more common cause is try- ing to move a directory to a different place in the disk hierarchy. You can rename a directory by using the MOVE command but not actually move it.  Error: A disk problem occurred while transferring the data from the source file to the destination. Use COPY to copy the file, compare it, and then delete the original.  Error: FORMAT cannot write to the BOOT track or DOS partition of the disk that is being formatted because one of these areas is bad. Discard the bad disk, insert another unformatted disk, and try the FORMAT command again.  Unable to write destination  Error: A disk problem occurred while transferring the data from the source file to the destination. Double-check that the destination disk has sufficient room for the file. If the error still occurs, use COPY.   556  Appendix C DOS Messages  Unrecognized command in CONFIG.SYS  Error in CONFIG.SYS line nnn  Warning  startup : DOS detected an improperly phrased command in CONFIG.SYS. The command is ignored, and DOS continues to start. Examine the indicated line in the CONFIG.SYS file, looking for an improperly phrased or incorrect command. Edit the line, save the file, and restart DOS.  Unrecognized switch  Error: You tried to use a switch that was illegal for the particular internal command. Type the command followed by  ? to find out what options are permitted.  Unrecoverable read error on drive x side n, track n  Error: DOS was unable to read the data at the specified location on the disk. DOS makes four attempts before generating this message. Copy all files on the questionable disk to another disk and try the command again, first with a new disk and then with the backup disk. If the original disk cannot be reformatted, discard it.  Unrecoverable transmission errors, maximum retries exceeded  Error: INTRSVR is getting excessive errors on the communications cable to INTERLNK. Check that the connections are screwed in tightly and that the cable is not routed too close to electrical interference, such as an arc welder. Unrecoverable write error on drive x side n, track n  Error: DOS was unable to write to a disk at the location specified. Try the command again; if the error recurs, the target disk is damaged at that location. If the damaged disk contains important data, copy the files to an empty, freshly formatted disk and try to reformat the damaged disk. If the disk is bad, discard it. WARNING: Unable to use a disk cache on the specified drive  Warning: You specified a drive that SMARTDRV cannot cache, such as a network drive. The version of SMARTDRV distributed with DOS 6.2 can cache CD-ROM drives, but previous versions cannot. SMARTDRV ignores this drive letter.  Write failure, diskette unusable  Error: The disk you are writing to has bad sectors in the boot sector or file allocation table  FAT . Run SCANDISK if you have DOS 6.2 to see whether the error can be cor- rected. If the disk is a floppy, you should probably discard it.  You have started the Interlnk server in a task-switching environment. Task-switching, key combinations, and some disk-writing operations are Disabled. To restore these functions, exit the server.  Warning: INTERLNK cannot permit certain operations to occur while it is in control. One of these is the DOSSHELL capability to switch tasks. If INTERLNK was swapped while communicating with INTERSVR, you might lose data. INTERLNK therefore inhibits these operations until it is complete.   DOS Device Error Messages  557  You must specify the host drive for a DoubleSpace drive  Error: SMARTDRV must be given the host drive letter to cache. The compressed drive also is cached, and the effective cache size is increased because of the compression. You cannot separately cache the compressed drive.  DOS Device Error Messages  When DOS detects an error reading or writing to a disk drive or device, one of the error messages in this section is displayed. Most of these messages are followed by this prompt: Abort, Ignore, Retry, Fail?  You can enter one of the following characters to indicate the action that you want DOS to take:  A  I  R  F  App C  Abort. This option terminates the currently running program and returns you to the DOS prompt. Any unsaved data in an application program is lost. Ignore. This option pretends that the error hasn’t occurred and returns  successfully  to the program that was running. If you are reading from a file, nonsensical data might be returned to your application program. If you are writing to a file, the application doesn’t know that the data hasn’t been written to disk, and this message might reappear many times as it keeps writing more data. In most cases, you should avoid choosing Ignore. For most floppy disk errors, the Ignore option is not displayed. Retry. This is the safest option to choose. If you can correct the prob- lem  by turning on the printer or closing the disk drive door, for exam- ple , do so and then choose Retry. Even if you can’t correct the problem, choose Retry a few times to see whether the error message goes away. Bad sectors can often be read if you choose Retry a few times. Fail. This option fails the operation and returns to the program that was running. Not all programs notice that the operation they requested has failed, in which case Fail has the same problems as Ignore. Use this option in preference to Ignore, but try Retry first. Versions of DOS before 3.3 never display the Fail option.  Many of the error messages have a similar format, as follows: error_type readingwriting drivedevice  error_type indicates the type of disk or device error that has occurred. drive indicates the disk drive where the error occurred. device indicates the device  AUX, CON, PRN, and so on  where the error occurred.   558  Appendix C DOS Messages  Each type of error can occur when either reading or writing to a disk or device. Rather than list all four possibilities for each error message, only the most common ones are shown in the text: Invalid device request reading drive x:  Invalid device request writing drive x:  Error: This error message is uncommon. A software program has issued an invalid or unsupported command to the drive or device indicated. The problem might be with the device driver or software program. If either of them is new to your system, contact the manufacturer of the software to see whether an upgrade is available.  Invalid device request parameters reading drive x:  Invalid device request parameters writing drive x:  Error: This error message is uncommon. A software program has issued a command to the indicated drive or device, but the command contains an invalid request header. The problem is usually with the software program. Contact the manufacturer of the software to see whether an upgrade is available.  Invalid unit reading drive x:  Error: An invalid subunit number was passed to the device driver. This error is dis- played if you try to access one of INTERLNK’s drives when the drive letter isn’t currently redirected to the INTERLNK server. Use the INTERLNK command to link the drive letter to a drive on the server and try again.  Data error reading drive x:  Error: DOS was unable to read some of the data on the disk. When this message appears, choose Retry at least two or three times before giving up. Quit the applica- tion you are using and run SCANDISK or CHKDSK to attempt to locate and correct the problem on the disk.  Not ready reading drive x:  Not ready writing drive x:  Error: An error occurred when DOS tried to read or write to the disk drive. For flop- py disk drives, the drive door might be open, the floppy disk might not be fully insert- ed, or the disk might not be formatted. Correct the situation and choose Retry. For hard disk drives, this error might indicate a hardware problem. If you get this error for a device rather than a disk drive, check to see that the device is turned on and ready to read or write.  FCB unavailable reading drive x:  FCB unavailable writing drive x:  Error: A program using file control blocks  FCBs  attempted to open more file control blocks than were specified with the FCBS= command. Usually, you have to choose the Abort option and terminate the program you are using. Increase the value of the FCBS=   DOS Device Error Messages  559  command in your CONFIG.SYS file by four or five; then reboot the system. If the mes- sage appears again, increase the value again and reboot. This method of opening files dates back to DOS 1 and CP M and should not be used by any current programs that you work with.  General failure reading drive x:  General failure writing drive x:  Error: This message is a catchall for errors not covered elsewhere and can occur with disk drives or other devices. Whenever a device driver is unsure of what to call the error it has just received, it calls the error a general failure. Reading disks formatted for operating systems other than DOS can often result in a general failure message. If you load the file-sharing SHARE.EXE program into memory, you might see this mes- sage more often. SHARE prevents two programs from opening the same file at the same time. Newer programs recognize that SHARE is denying them access, but others might return general failure messages. If you are running Windows and receive this message in a DOS program, don’t panic. It probably means that another application has a file open, and you are being denied access.  App C  Lock violation reading drive x:  Lock violation writing drive x:  Error: With a file-sharing program such as SHARE.EXE or network software loaded, a program attempted to access a locked file. Your best choice is Retry. If you are on a network, get a cup of coffee and choose Retry again to see whether the other user has released the lock yet. If you just can’t seem to get access to the file, choose Fail. The program you are using might notice the failure and ask you what to do about it. The last resort is to choose Abort, but be aware that any unsaved data in memory will be lost when the program is terminated.  Sharing violation reading drive x:  Sharing violation writing drive x:  Error: With a file-sharing program such as SHARE.EXE or network software loaded, a program attempted to access a file that is in use by another program. Your best choice is Retry. If you are on a network, get a cup of coffee and then choose Retry again to see whether the file is available yet. If you can’t get access to the file, choose Fail. The program you are using might notice the failure and ask you what to do about it. The last resort is to choose Abort, but be aware that any unsaved data in memory will be lost when the program is terminated.  Printer out of paper error writing device dev  Error: The printer is out of paper  or not turned on . Check your printer, add paper, make sure the printer is online, and choose Retry. The message DOS displays stays on the screen waiting for you to make a choice, so you could go across town and buy paper if you need to.   560  Appendix C DOS Messages  Invalid media type reading drive x:  Invalid media type writing drive x:  Error: The boot sector or the file allocation table  FAT  of the disk contains invalid information, making the disk unusable. If you come into contact with computers using operating systems other than DOS, you might be trying to read one of their disks. When you are sure that the disk is a DOS disk, run SCANDISK or CHKDSK to see whether it can be repaired. Even if the repair is successful, you should back up all the files on the disk and reformat it. If FORMAT finds no errors, you can safely begin using the disk again.  Not ready reading drive x:  Not ready writing drive x:  Error: This error message is common. It usually means that you’ve left open the door to your floppy disk drive. Other common causes are that the drive is empty or the disk isn’t seated properly. Check the drive or reinsert the disk, and then choose Retry. If you can’t get a floppy disk drive to read any disks that you put in it, you might have a hardware problem.  Read fault error reading drive x:  Error: DOS was unable to read data from the drive. Often this problem is caused by a floppy disk that isn’t seated properly in the drive, or you might have a bad spot on the disk. Reinsert the disk and choose Retry. Usually, the read operation succeeds after you choose Retry a few times. Check the disk by running SCANDISK to make sure that no errors appear on it, or back up any files and reformat the disk. If you begin to get several of these errors, your floppy disk drive might be out of alignment. When this problem occurs, people typically start complaining that they can’t read your disks. If your drive is out of alignment, your only options are to repair or replace the drive.  Sector not found reading drive x:  Sector not found writing drive x:  Error: The disk drive was unable to find the requested sector on the disk. This error  is usually the result of a defective spot on the disk. Choose Retry quite a few times before you give up; often the sector will be found if you’re persistent. Check the disk by running SCANDISK to make sure that no errors appear on it, or back up any files and reformat the disk. Some copy-protection schemes use a defective spot to prevent unauthorized duplica- tion of the disk. If you have reason to believe that the disk you are reading or writing to is copy-protected, do not correct the disk by running SCANDISK. Contact the manu- facturer of the copy-protected software and ask for a replacement disk.  Seek error reading drive x:  Seek error writing drive x:   DOS Device Error Messages  561  Error: The disk drive could not find the proper track on the disk. Seek errors are often the result of failing drive electronics. If, however, the disk is not properly seated in the drive, reseating it corrects the problem. Choose Retry a few times to see whether the problem goes away. If you are having a hardware problem, you will get more of these errors as time goes on and will eventually have to repair or replace your disk drive.  Write fault error writing drive x:  Error: DOS was unable to write data to the drive. Often this problem is caused by a floppy disk that isn’t seated properly in the drive, or you might have a bad spot on the disk. Reinsert the disk and choose Retry. The write operation usually succeeds after you choose Retry a few times. Check the disk by running SCANDISK to make sure that no errors appear on it, or back up any files and reformat the disk. If you begin to get several of these errors, your floppy disk drive might be out of alignment. When this problem occurs, people typically start complaining that they can’t read your disks. If your drive is out of alignment, your only options are repair or replacement.  Write fault error writing device dev  Error: DOS could not write the data to this device. This error typically is caused by not having your printer turned on or online, although the same thing can happen with an external modem. Check the device and choose Retry. If the problem persists, you might have a faulty cable.  Write protect error writing drive x:  Error: DOS attempted to write to a disk that is write-protected. If the disk is a floppy and the write operation is intentional, remove the disk, adjust the write-protect tab, and reinsert the disk. Don’t switch floppy disks at this prompt. To allow the write operation to proceed, make sure that the disk is no longer write-protected and choose Retry. If you don’t want to allow the program to write to the disk, choose Fail or, as a last resort, Abort. Remember that if you choose Abort, any unsaved data in memory will be lost.  Invalid disk change reading drive x:  Invalid disk change writing drive x:  Error: You have removed a disk that DOS needs access to. This message can occur only with removable media, such as floppy disks. Unfortunately, DOS doesn’t tell you what disk it needs; it tells you only the drive. Think back, put the previous disk back in the drive, and choose Retry. Choosing any other option might mean that the disk that was prematurely removed might be damaged or incomplete. Never choose Fail or Abort at this message without first removing all media from the disk drive because DOS could write the wrong file allocation table  FAT  to that disk and destroy all the data on it.

These keys are available only in MS-DOS 6.0 and later:    F5  Clean Boot . MS-DOS performs a minimal startup, ignoring any CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files in the root directory of the startup drive. DBLSPACE.BIN is still loaded into memory if your system uses compressed drives.    Ctrl+F5  Clean Boot . Just like F5, except DBLSPACE.BIN is not loaded into memory.  Any compressed drives are inaccessible.    F8  Interactive Boot . MS-DOS prompts you for every line in your CONFIG.SYS file, enabling you to selectively execute or skip each line. To execute the remaining com- mands without being prompted, press the Esc key. When the CONFIG.SYS file is com- plete, DOS asks whether you want to execute your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Note that DBLSPACE.BIN is still loaded into memory if your system uses compressed drives. With F8  Interactive Boot , you cannot choose whether to load DBLSPACE.BIN into memory. For MS-DOS 6.2, Microsoft has changed the behavior of the F8 key, and you are now prompted for each line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file as well as in your CONFIG.SYS file. To stop being prompted for each line, press the Esc key to execute or press the F5 key to bypass all the remaining lines in your startup files.    Ctrl+F8  Interactive Boot . This is just like the F8 boot, except DBLSPACE.BIN is not  loaded into memory. Any compressed drives are inaccessible.  ROM BIOS Control Keys  ROM BIOS commands are available at all times, although an application program can pre- vent them from working.  All are eliminated or changed when Microsoft Windows is active.  Break and Reboot should be avoided if possible because terminating a program in this way can damage open files, causing lost clusters or data loss. Your computer’s ROM BIOS may provide other key combinations as well, such as commands to change processor speed, enter sleep mode, or access the CMOS Setup screen. Some keyboards provide a single key for these services  listed in Table D.1 .  Table D.1 BIOS Control Keys and Their Functions  Keystroke  Ctrl+Alt+Del  Function Reboot  Ctrl+Break  Break  Description Requests the BIOS to perform a system reset  warm boot . Use only at the DOS prompt or when the com- puter stops responding to normal commands.  Stops  exits  a command or software application pro- gram. Use with caution.   Command-Line Editing Keys Without DOSKEY  565  Table D.1 Continued  Keystroke  Shift+PrtSc  Function Print screen  SysReq  System request  Description Prints the contents of the video display  text only . Check that your printer is turned on before requesting this service.  Requests system services. Does nothing on most PC systems. Not available on older 83-key keyboards.  DOS Control Keys  DOS provides the following functions, listed in Table D.2, although application programs often prevent them from working.  All are eliminated or changed when Microsoft Windows is active.   Table D.2 DOS Control Keys and Their Functions  Keystroke  Ctrl+C  Function Break  Description Stops  exits  a command or software application pro- gram. Very useful for halting DOS commands. This DOS-provided Break command is somewhat safer than the Break command provided by the ROM BIOS.  Ctrl+S  Ctrl+P  Pause  Pauses the system until the next key is pressed. Identical to the ROM BIOS–provided service.  Echo to PRN  Echoes all characters to the printer  LPT1  as well as to the screen. Press Ctrl+P a second time to turn off.  Command-Line Editing Keys Without DOSKEY  The following keys listed in Table D.3 enable you to edit text on the command line when DOSKEY is not loaded. When you press Enter, the command line is placed in a template buffer and then executed by DOS. By pressing certain function keys, you can reuse charac- ters from the template buffer in the next command line.  A cursor  current position  is maintained for both the template buffer offscreen and the command line onscreen. Normally, both cursors track each other, but certain function keys can alter this tracking. All actions are performed on the character at the cursor.  App D   566  Appendix D DOS and DOS Utility Programs’ Keyboard Commands  Table D.3 MS-DOS Command-Line Editing Keys and Their Functions  Function Execute  Cancel  Delete  Copy one  Copy up to  Copy all  Skip one  Skip up to  Add in  Description Executes the current command line and places a copy of it in the template buffer.  Cancels the current command line without changing the template buffer. Resets the template cursor to the beginning of the line.  Moves left and one character from the command line.  Leaves the template buffer unchanged.  Copies one character from the template to the  command line.  Copies all remaining characters from the template up to, but not including, the next character you type.  Copies all remaining characters from the template to the command line.  Skips  deletes  one character in the template buffer.  Complement of F1.   Skips  deletes  all remaining characters from the tem- plate up to, but not including, the next character you type.  Complement of F2.   Toggles insert mode. In insert mode, characters you type at the command line do not cause the template cursor to move. Note that this doesn’t enable you to insert characters on the command line by moving the cursor and typing. It enables you only to type without moving the template cursor at the same time.  Keystroke  Enter  Esc  Backspace or left arrow  F1 or right arrow  F2  F3  Del  F4  Ins  F5  F6  New template  Copies the current command line into the template buffer but doesn’t execute the command line.  EOF  Inserts an end-of-file  EOF  marker  Ctrl+Z  into the command line.  When you use the console like an input file with certain commands  for example, COPY CON filename , some of the previous keystrokes become very useful. Pressing F6 inserts an end- of-file marker  Ctrl+Z  into the file and terminates the copy operation when you press Enter.  Anything you type after the Ctrl+Z is discarded.  Pressing Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C aborts the copy operation.

App D    APPENDIX  E  ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes  ASCII  American Standard Code for Information Interchange  is a widely used standard that deﬁnes numeric values for a common set of alphabetic characters. The ﬁrst 32 charac- ters are reserved for formatting and hardware control codes. Following these codes are 96 “printable” characters. IBM deﬁned symbols for the ﬁnal 128 ASCII values when it released the IBM PC, and referred to the additional characters as Extended ASCII codes. This entire set of 256 characters is often referred to as the PC-8 character set, or code page 437.   574  Appendix E ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes   ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes  575  Part V App E   576  Appendix E ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes   ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes  577  Part V App E   578  Appendix E ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes   ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes  579  Part V App E   580  Appendix E ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes   ASCII and Extended ASCII Codes  581  Part V App E    APPENDIX  F  Command Reference  With every new release, Microsoft has added features to MS-DOS. MS-DOS 6.22 now con- tains more than 100 commands, providing configuration support and utilities for the large variety of computers that run MS-DOS. Many commands help you organize the files and subdirectories on your hard disk or enable you to configure your computer system to run more efficiently. Other commands enable you to automate routine tasks that you perform with your computer every day. DOS now includes commands that provide support for the various characters and conventions used in many countries other than the United States.  This command reference describes all the commands that Microsoft provides in the stan- dard MS-DOS 6.22 package. Each command entry includes a description of the command’s purpose, its syntax, notes and rules on how to use it, examples of its use, error messages and exit codes when applicable, and a “See Also” section that points you to additional informa- tion about using a particular command.  This command reference also describes commands provided in other common DOS ver- sions, including MS-DOS “7”  in Windows 95 , MS-DOS “7.1”  in Windows 98 , Caldera DR DOS, and IBM’s PC-DOS.  DOS Commands by Function  So that you can easily find the command you’re looking for, the following lists group the various DOS commands by their functions and contain short descriptions of each command. Many commands have more than one function, so they may appear in more than one group. When you locate the command you want in these function lists, turn to the reference sec- tion for much more detailed information about a particular command. The reference sec- tion lists the commands in alphabetical order.   584  Appendix F  Command Reference  In the following function lists, the commands are divided into these categories:  Batch File Commands CONFIG.SYS Commands CONFIG.SYS Device Drivers Directory Commands Disk Commands File Commands Full-Screen DOS Applications Help Commands International Commands and Device Drivers Memory and System Performance Commands Miscellaneous Commands Windows Applications  Batch File Commands  Executes a batch file from within another batch file.

Conventions Used in This Command Reference  The following conventions have been used throughout this reference to make the command descriptions clear and accurate:  Bold  Italic  Required literal. Indicates an argument that is required and must be typed as part of the command. For example, the com- mand name always appears in bold because it must be included when you issue the command. Optional placeholder. The placeholder holds the place for the actual name or value that you would type when you issue the command. In other words, you don’t type the word filename, you replace filename with the actual name of a file.   Conventions Used in This Command Reference  591  Bold italic  Monospaced type  Required placeholder. Indicates a placeholder argument that is required. When you issue the command, you must substitute an appropriate value for an argument that appears in bold italic. Optional literal. Indicates an optional argument that, if includ- ed, must be typed as shown. Switches often are optional literal arguments.  The COPY command, for example, uses all four types of arguments in its syntax: COPY source destination  V    COPY is a required literal, so it appears in bold. The command name always has to be  typed exactly as it is shown, although you can add a drive and subdirectory path before the command when necessary.    source is a required placeholder, so it appears in bold italic. In this case, you would  enter the name of the file or files that you wanted to copy.    destination is an optional placeholder, so it appears in regular italic. If you choose to omit this argument, a default value is assumed. As with all placeholders, if you include this argument, you replace the word destination with the filename and path where you want to copy the files.     V is an optional literal, so it appears in regular text. Most switches are optional. If you  want to include one, you must type it exactly as it is shown.  DOS is not usually sensitive to the case of the characters you use. Normally, you can type command lines in any mixture of upper- or lowercase characters. Some third-party utilities and a few DOS commands, however, do use case-sensitive parameters. When upper- or  lowercase is significant in a command’s syntax, it is noted in the text.  Pay particular attention to the punctuation used in syntax lines. DOS is often very picky about punctuation; if a semicolon is shown, a comma rarely will do the trick. Spaces are an exception: Where one space is shown, more than one space or tab usually is acceptable. The order of command arguments is usually somewhat flexible, with switches allowed either before or after filename arguments. Exceptions are noted in the text.  Every command line begins the same way—with the name of the command you want to run. Internal commands are located inside COMMAND.COM and are always available at the DOS prompt. External commands are files with .COM or .EXE extensions that are located on your disk. To run an external command, COMMAND.COM must be able to find the corresponding file on disk. The Setup program for DOS 6 places all the external commands in the C:\DOS sub- directory by default. To help COMMAND.COM find external commands, Setup also adds or edits the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include the C:\DOS subdirectory. As long as the subdirectory in which the command is located is included in your DOS PATH, you can simply type the name of the command at the command line and COMMAND.COM finds the exe- cutable file. If you move any of the files or if you remove the C:\DOS subdirectory from your  App F   592  Appendix F  Command Reference  DOS PATH, you have to specify the location of external commands by including the subdi- rectory in which they are located as part of the name of the command.  Icons Used in This Command Reference  To help you quickly identify the function of a particular command, this command reference uses the following icons:  AVOID  BATCH  FILE  C:\>  CONFIG  SYS  !DANGER  DEVICE =  DISK  SYSTEM  INI  T S R  Windows  9x  PC-DOS  DR-DOS  You should avoid using this command unless absolutely  necessary. This command frequently is used in batch files.  You can issue this command from the DOS prompt.  You can choose to include this command in your CONFIG.SYS file.  This command is dangerous; use it with extreme caution.  This command is used as a device driver and normally is loaded through your CONFIG.SYS file. You use this command to access a full-blown DOS utility.  This command enables you to configure your system for use outside  the U.S. This command is new in MS-DOS 6.2.  This command is included on the MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 Supplemental Disk. You can choose to include this command in your SYSTEM.INI file.  This terminate-and-stay-resident command loads into memory and may be accessed anytime thereafter. You can use this command with Microsoft Windows.  This command is specific to the versions of DOS with Windows 95 and Windows 98. This command is specific to IBM’s PC-DOS.  This command is specific to Caldera’s DR DOS.   Conventions Used in This Command Reference  593  Filenames and Pathnames  Filenames and pathnames for MS-DOS consist of a series of standard parts, and DOS makes certain assumptions when these parts are omitted. A fully qualified pathname consists of the following parts: drive:\path1\path2\ ... \filename.ext  drive:  Represents the disk drive letter.  path1, path2  Represent the subdirectories.  filename  Represents the one- to eight-character name of the file.  .ext  ...  Represents the optional extension to the filename. When included, the extension can be up to three characters in length.  An ellipsis in a syntax line indicates that the preceding argument can be repeated one or more times. The spaces around the ellipsis are added here only for clarity. An actual pathname can never include any spaces.  Note that a disk drive letter, when present, is always followed by a colon. The drive  with colon , all pathnames, and the filename are separated from each other by backslash charac- ters  \ . The filename extension, when present, is always separated from the filename by a period.  If no drive is specified, the current disk drive is assumed. If no path is specified, the current subdirectory of that disk drive is used. Typically, commands that accept wildcard characters in their filename arguments default to “all files” if no filename is specified. Otherwise, no defaults are assumed for the filename portion.  In this command reference, the term filename refers to the one- to eight-character name of a file, either with or without a one- to three-character extension. The term pathname refers to the complete path to a file  the drive, subdirectory path, and filename .  Legal Filename Characters  DOS allows only certain characters to be included in the name of a file or subdirectory. All the letters A to Z, either upper- or lowercase, and the numbers 0 to 9 are allowed. In addi- tion, the following punctuation characters are acceptable: &  ‘  @  ^  _  {  }  $  !  -          %  ‘  ~  App F  No other punctuation or special characters are permissible in a filename.  If you are using a non-USA code page, you may have additional legal filename characters, such as accented characters.   Most of the illegal filename characters have a special meaning on the command line. Spaces, tabs, commas, and semicolons typically are used to separate arguments. The colon  :  indi- cates a disk drive letter, and the backslash  \  separates subdirectories or indicates the root directory. The greater-than  > , less-than  < , and pipe    characters are used for redirection and piping. Although percent signs  %  are legal, you should avoid using them in your    594  Appendix F  Command Reference  filenames because this character indicates replaceable parameters and can lead to some con- fusing errors in batch files.  Consider using an underscore  _  or a hyphen  -  in file or subdirectory names in which you normally would use a space. This naming convention can help make your filenames more readable, as in MY_FILE.TXT.  DOS converts all pathname characters to uppercase before searching for the file, so you  can enter pathnames in any combination of upper- and lowercase letters that suits you. MYFILE.TXT, myfile.txt, and MyFiLe.TxT all refer to the same file as far as DOS is con- cerned.  DOS Reserved Names  Although you are free to name your files anything you would like, a few filenames have spe- cial meaning to MS-DOS. They refer to specific devices attached to your computer system; when you use them on the command line in place of a filename, they always refer to that device, not a file on the disk.  Name NUL  CON  LPTx  PRN COMx AUX  Device That Name Refers To The null device. This is your computer’s equivalent of the Black Hole, which accepts  and ignores  anything written to it. The standard device for input and output. CON normally refers to the keyboard for input and the video display for output. The printer  parallel  ports. The x represents the port number, as in LPT1. The primary printer port, normally the same as LPT1. The serial ports. The x represents the port number, as in COM1. The primary serial port, normally the same as COM1.  In some cases, you are required to enter these names followed by a colon  : , as if you were referring to a disk drive. Normally, however, you just use them as though they refer to a file in the current directory. No matter what drive, path, or extension you include with these reserved names, they always refer to that device and never to a file on your disk.  In other words, you cannot have a file named PRN.TXT on your disk because this name always refers to the printer and not to a disk file.  If, however, you specify a drive or path that doesn’t exist, you do receive an error message.  ?, *  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  1.0 and later—Internal With certain commands, you can use wildcard characters in the filename portion of a path- name argument to specify more than one file at a time. You can use the question mark  ?  to match any single character and the asterisk  *  to match multiple characters. Wildcards are never allowed in the drive or subdirectory portions of a pathname.   ?, *  1.0 and later—Internal  595  Using the ? Wildcard Character in a Filename or Extension  A question mark  ?  can be used to match any single character in a filename or extension. For example, typing MYFILE.T?T matches files named MYFILE.TXT and MYFILE.TOT but not MYFILE.TT or MYFILE.TXB. To match the latter, you have to specify MYFILE.T??. Notice that a question mark placed in the middle of the filename or extension matches any single character in that position, whereas a question mark placed at the end also matches zero characters.  Using the * Wildcard Character in a Filename or Extension  An asterisk  *  matches zero or more characters from the position in which it is placed to the end of the filename or extension. For example, MY*.TXT matches MYFILE.TXT and MYHOUSE.TXT but not MYFILE.DOC or YOURFILE.TXT. Any characters following an asterisk in the filename, or following an asterisk in the extension, are ignored. In other words, typing MY*.TXT or MY*FILE.TXT gives you exactly the same result.  For most commands that accept wildcards, if you enter a filename with no extension, all extensions are matched. For example, MYFILE matches MYFILE, MYFILE.TXT, and MYFILE.DOC, whereas MY* matches MYHOUSE.TXT as well. If you type a period after the filename  for exam- ple, MYFILE. or MY*. , only files with no extension are matched.  Match any filename.  Same as *.* in most cases.  ????????.???  Same as *.*  Examples  *.*  *  *.  *.??  ?.*  *.BAK  MYFILE  MY*.*  M?F*.?XT  Match any filename that has no extension.  Match any file that has a zero- to two-letter extension.  Match any file that has a one-letter filename.  Match all files with a .BAK extension.  Match all files with the filename MYFILE with any  or no  extension.  Match all files that begin with MY.  Match any file that begins with the letter M, has an F as the third char- acter in the filename, and has a three-letter extension that ends in XT.  App F  See Also  “Introducing the DOS File System” in Chapter 5   596  Appendix F  Command Reference  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  > and >>  2.0 and later—Internal You can use the greater-than redirection symbols  > and >>  on the command line to instruct DOS to take any output that normally would be written to the screen and send it some- where else. These symbols are handy for sending the output of a command, such as DIR, to the printer  DIR > PRN  or to a file on disk  DIR > MYFILE.TXT . Using two greater-than signs  >>  tells DOS to append the output to the file specified  if it already exists  instead of over- writing the file as it normally would. For example, DIR  C:\DOS  > DIR_LIST.TXT  creates  or overwrites if it already exists  the file DIR_LIST.TXT in the current directory and fills it with a list of all the files in the C:\DOS subdirectory. However, the command DIR  C:\WIN  >> DIR_LIST.TXT  appends  adds  a list of all the files in the C:\WIN subdirectory to the end of the DIR_LIST.TXT file.  Notice that only the program output normally written to the screen is redirected. For exam- ple, the command COPY  MYFILE.TXT  YOURFILE.TXT  >  COPYMSG.TXT  still copies MYFILE.TXT to YOURFILE.TXT, but the message 1 file s  copied is written to the file COPYMSG.TXT.  In batch files, it is fairly common to redirect messages from commands such as COPY to the NUL device, as in the following: COPY  MYFILE.TXT  YOURFILE.TXT  >  NUL  This technique can keep the onscreen clutter generated by a batch file to a minimum because anything written to the NUL device is essentially thrown away.  See Also  <, , FIND, MORE, and SORT  “Using Redirection Commands” in Chapter 13  <  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  2.0 and later—Internal  Programs normally expect input from the user to come from the keyboard. If you want to provide this input from a file instead of the keyboard, you can use the less-than redirection symbol  <  to redirect that program’s input. DOS includes three commands specifically designed to use with input redirection: MORE, SORT, and FIND.  One common use for input redirection is with the MORE filter program. To display the con- tents of the file README.TXT one screen at a time, you type the following command: MORE  <  README.TXT     2.0 and later—Internal  597  To sort all the lines in a text file, you might use the SORT command like this: SORT     SORTED.TXT  This command sorts all the lines in UNSORTED.TXT into alphabetical order and writes the sorted output to SORTED.TXT. If you did not include the > SORTED.TXT argument, SORT would write the sorted lines to the display  standard output . If you forgot to redirect the input to the SORT command  that is, if you did not include the < UNSORTED.TXT argument , DOS would wait for you to type the input at the keyboard.  Occasionally, you find a use for input redirection when you are automating the input to a program. Many software patches distributed as batch files use this technique to redirect DEBUG’s input to a text file to make changes to a program file.  Indeed, this is just what the SPATCH.BAT file on the DOS 6 distribution disk does.  Just remember that after the input to a program is redirected, control does not return to the keyboard until the program termi- nates. If you forget to put the keystrokes that exit the program at the end of your input file, you have to reboot your computer to regain control.  See Also  > and >>, , FIND, MORE, and SORT  “Using Redirection Commands” in Chapter 13  C:\>    BATCH  FILE  2.0 and later—Internal You can use the pipe character    on the command line to tell DOS to use the screen output from one program as the keyboard input to another.  The term pipe comes from the Unix operating system, which often uses this method to string together several programs to per- form a particular job.  For the pipe character to work, the first program must write output to the screen that the second program expects to get from the keyboard.  In DOS, pipe characters are most often used with the TYPE and MORE commands to display a text file one screen at a time, as in the following: TYPE  README.TXT    MORE  You also can combine MORE with FIND to look at the results of a text search one screen at a time, as in this example: FIND  “Mr. Merryweather”  BIGTEXT.TXT    MORE  App F  DOS actually accomplishes piping by writing the output from the first program to a tempo- rary file and then redirecting the input for the second program from that file. When the second program terminates, DOS deletes the temporary file. So, the preceding command accomplishes the same thing as the following three commands: FIND “Mr. Merryweather” BIGTEXT.TXT > TEMP.TXT MORE < TEMP.TXT DEL TEMP.TXT   598  Appendix F  Command Reference  Using the pipe character saves you from having to type all three of these commands.  See Also  > and >>, <, FIND, MORE, and SORT  “Using Redirection Commands” in Chapter 13  :label  BATCH  FILE  1.0 and later—Internal  In a batch file, you can type a colon  :  in the first column of any line to indicate that the next eight characters on that line should be interpreted as a label. Any additional characters on the line after the label are ignored. Labels are used as the destination for GOTO statements in batch files.  Syntax  :label  Notes  1. To define a label, you must use a colon as the first character on the line. Not even a  space or tab character can precede it.  2. Only the first eight characters of a label are significant, although the label can be as  long as you like. Everything on the line after the eighth character of the label is ignored.  3. Although you can define the same label in more than one place in a batch file, the GOTO  command always jumps to the first occurrence.  4. Labels and filenames share the same legal characters with the exception that labels can-  not include percent signs  %  or hyphens  - . Batch file labels can be typed in any mix- ture of upper- and lowercase characters.  Examples  GOTO SKIP_DEL DEL *.BAK :SKIP_DEL   This text will be ignored  In this example, when DOS executes the line containing the GOTO SKIP_DEL command, DOS searches for the :SKIP_DEL label and continues execution with the line that follows it. The DEL *.BAK command is never executed.  Messages  Label not found  Error: The label specified in a GOTO statement was not found. After displaying this message, the batch file terminates.   %n  1.0 and later—Internal  599  See Also GOTO  “Branching with GOTO” in Chapter 16  %n  BATCH  FILE  1.0 and later—Internal You can use replaceable parameters to represent command-line arguments from within a batch file. DOS replaces these markers with their corresponding command-line arguments when the batch file is executed.  Syntax %n  Notes  1. Ten replaceable parameters are available, %0 through %9. 2. %0 returns the name of the batch file as it was entered on the command line, %1 returns the first argument on the command line, %2 returns the second, and so on. Spaces, tabs, commas, and semicolons all are considered valid argument delimiters. To include a delimiter in a command-line argument, enclose the argument in double quotation marks.  3. DOS can find replaceable parameters almost anywhere in a batch file, including   within double quotation marks and embedded in words. For example, the filename MY%1FILE.TXT is a perfectly legal filename for DOS; in a batch file, however, the %1 embedded in the name is replaced with the first argument to the batch file. This can lead to some strange errors.  4. If you want to include a percent sign in a batch file, write it twice. When DOS is pars-  ing the file, it sees the two percent signs  %%  and replaces them with a single percent sign  % . For example, %1 is replaced with the first argument to the batch file, whereas %%1 simply becomes %1. This rule explains why the variable markers in a FOR loop must be written as %%a in a batch file, but as %a from the command line. In a batch file, DOS removes the doubled %% signs and replaces them with a single % before the FOR command gets to see it. If you forget and use a single percent sign, DOS removes it and leaves only the a, which results in a syntax error.  5. If you require more than nine arguments in your batch file, you can use the SHIFT  command to gain access to them.  6. An empty parameter is replaced with nothing at all. In other words, if you enter  MY%2.TXT in your batch file and then forget to enter a second parameter when you run the batch file, DOS looks for the file MY.TXT.  App F   600  Appendix F  Command Reference  Examples  The following batch file displays a series of files one screen at a time: :START IF “%1”==”” GOTO END IF NOT EXIST %1 GOTO END TYPE %1  MORE SHIFT GOTO START :END  In the first IF statement, the %1 is replaced with the first argument to the batch file. As long as the argument exists, the statement is false and execution continues on the next line. The second IF statement checks to see whether this argument is a valid pathname. If the argu- ment passes this check, execution finally passes to the TYPE command, which types the file to the screen through the MORE filter program. When TYPE finishes, SHIFT moves the arguments down one place, and the next line transfers execution back to the first line in the batch file. The loop continues until the batch file runs out of arguments or finds an invalid pathname.  The preceding example isn’t quite foolproof. If wildcards are included in the first argument to this batch file, it easily could pass both of the tests you perform with the IF commands. TYPE, however, cannot handle wildcards and would display the message Invalid  filename or file not found rather than the files you specified.  See Also  %name%, IF, FOR, and SHIFT  “Understanding Replaceable Parameters” in Chapter 16  %envir%  BATCH  FILE  4.0 and later—Internal With the addition of the %envir% syntax in MS-DOS 4.0, users finally had access to variables in batch files. Before executing a line in a batch file, DOS replaces every occurrence of %envir% with the contents of the corresponding environment variable. When combined with the capability of the SET command to create and destroy environment variables, this feature can be very powerful.  Syntax  %envir%  Notes  1. The name of the environment variable can be entered in upper- or lowercase charac-  ters, but it must be surrounded by percent signs  %  to be recognized by DOS.  2. DOS can find the variable placeholder almost anywhere in a batch file, including  enclosed in double quotation marks or embedded within words. Any pair of percent   %envir%  4.0 and later—Internal  601  signs enclosing characters is assumed to be an environment variable.  If the first charac- ter following the percent sign is a digit, DOS assumes you are referring to a replaceable parameter, not an environment variable.  The string with values between 7% and 15% annually would tell DOS to search for an environment variable named “ and 15”. When DOS failed to find such a variable, it would change the string to read with  values between 7 annually.  3. If you want to include a percent sign in a batch file, write it twice. When DOS is pars-  ing the file, it sees the two percent signs  %%  and replaces them with a single one  % . For example, %PATH% is replaced with the contents of the PATH environment variable, whereas %%PATH%% becomes %PATH%.  4. If no environment variable with that name exists, the %envir% placeholder is replaced  with an empty string.  Examples  To add a subdirectory to your PATH, execute a particular program, and then restore your original PATH, you might use a batch file like this: SET OLDPATH=%PATH% PATH C:\CADD;%PATH% C:\CADD\CADD.EXE %1 PATH %OLDPATH% SET OLDPATH=  The first line saves the current PATH setting in an environment variable named OLDPATH. Next, the subdirectory C:\CADD is added to the PATH. In the third line, the program is execut- ed, and a single command-line argument is passed to it if one exists. Finally, when the pro- gram terminates, PATH is set equal to OLDPATH and the OLDPATH variable is deleted.  You can easily run out of space in the environment while manipulating variables in batch files, especially if you are running them from a Shell program such as DOSSHELL. When this happens, DOS displays the message Out of environment space and then continues execut- ing the batch file. To make the preceding example abort if not enough environment space is available, add an IF statement, as follows, to check whether OLDPATH was successfully created: SET OLDPATH=%PATH% IF “%OLDPATH%”==”” GOTO ERROR PATH C:\CADD;%PATH% C:\CADD\CADD.EXE %1 PATH %OLDPATH% SET OLDPATH= GOTO END :ERROR ECHO Can’t start CADD - not enough environment space :END  Now CADD doesn’t execute if not enough environment space is available to save OLDPATH. To increase the size of the environment, increase the size of the  E:size parameter specified in the SHELL= command in your CONFIG.SYS file.  App F   602  Appendix F  Command Reference  If you are running batch files from within a Shell program such as DOSSHELL, increasing the  E:size parameter may not help. When DOS runs a program, it gives the program access to a copy of the current environment. This copy is only big enough to hold the environment variables that are currently defined and has very little free space in it. When you run a batch file from within a Shell program, a temporary copy of COMMAND.COM is loaded into memory, and a copy of the shrunken environment the Shell program was using is passed to it. With so little available space in the current environment, batch files often run out of environment space.  One technique to avoid Out of environment space error messages when you run batch files from a Shell program is to define a dummy variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file that simply takes up space, as shown in this example: SET DUMMY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  When you need space in the environment, simply delete the DUMMY variable, as follows, before you define any new variables that your batch file needs: SET DUMMY= SET OLDPATH=%PATH%  When your batch file terminates, you return to your Shell program, and the copy of the environment that the batch file was using is discarded. Because the DUMMY variable is being thrown away, there is no reason to restore it before the batch file exits.  If you might run this batch file from the DOS prompt when your Shell program isn’t run- ning, include a SET statement, such as the following, that restores your DUMMY variable after you delete OLDPATH: SET OLDPATH= SET DUMMY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX GOTO END  See Also  %n, IF, SET, and SHELL=  Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files”  @  BATCH  FILE  4.0 and later—Internal Normally, DOS echoes to the screen every line in a batch file before executing it. Although this capability can be handy when you are testing a new batch file, you usually want to use ECHO OFF to turn off the echo feature in a batch file you use every day. With the “at” sign  @ , you can turn echo off for each line individually if you want to.  Syntax  @command_line   ; 6.0 and later—Internal  603  Notes  after it.  1. The @ symbol must be the first character on the line. Don’t insert any spaces before or  2. The most common use of the @ symbol is with the ECHO OFF command that begins most batch files. Because the echo feature is on when this command is executed, the ECHO OFF command is echoed to the screen—unless you precede the ECHO OFF command with an @ symbol.  3. Only the display of the command line that DOS executes is suppressed, not screen out- put generated by a command, which can be rather confusing to some users. To suppress the output generated by a command, you have to redirect the output of the command to the NUL device. For example, @COPY  MYFILE.TXT  YOURFILE.TXT does not echo the command line itself  COPY  MYFILE.TXT, and so on  to the screen, but still displays the message 1 file s  copied that is generated by COPY. If, in addition, you redirect the screen output of the COPY command to the NUL device @COPY  MYFILE.TXT  YOURFILE.TXT  > NUL nothing is displayed on the screen at all.  See Also  > and >>, and ECHO  “Using Batch File Commands” in Chapter 16  ;  CONFIG  SYS  6.0 and later—Internal When DOS encounters a semicolon as the first character on a line in your CONFIG.SYS file, it ignores the contents of the rest of the line. Using a semicolon in this way is exactly the same as using the REM command. Inserting comments into your CONFIG.SYS file can help you remember what each line is for.  ;comment text  Syntax  Notes  App F  1. To mark a line in CONFIG.SYS as a comment, you must add the semicolon  ;  as the first  character on the line. Do not precede it with any spaces.  The configuration lines necessary for many devices are quite complicated, so using a semi- colon to “comment them out” can be a handy way to turn features on and off in  your CONFIG.SYS file.   604  Appendix F  Command Reference  2. Note that this technique for creating a comment line works only in CONFIG.SYS. To insert a comment in a batch file, you either have to use REM or define a dummy label line with a colon.  3. If you find yourself continually commenting and uncommenting DEVICE= lines in your CONFIG.SYS file, consider using the question mark  ?  instead so that you can enable or disable that driver interactively each time you boot up. If you insert a question mark  ?  between the command name and equal sign, DOS asks you before it executes a com- mand in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Examples  Comments can help you keep track of what each line in your CONFIG.SYS file is for, as shown in the following: ; The old SCSI drive requires double buffering. ; Remember to remove this line when the new drive gets installed!!! DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE  DOUBLE_BUFFER  DOS skips over all lines that start with a semicolon and executes only the DEVICE= line that loads SMARTDrive’s double-buffering feature.  ?  CONFIG  SYS  6.0 and later—Internal  In CONFIG.SYS, if you put a question mark  ?  between a command and the equal sign  = , DOS prompts you for confirmation before executing that command. This technique works for all CONFIG.SYS commands that use the command= form, including the SET command.  See Also  ? and REM  Chapter 2, “Starting DOS”  Syntax  command?=settings  Parameters and Switches  command  This parameter can be any CONFIG.SYS command that uses the command= format.  settings The settings used with the command specified  when you allow it to be run .  Notes  1. Use the question mark  ?  for individual features you want to control. If you find your- self using more than one or two question marks in your CONFIG.SYS file, however, you might want to consider setting up a menu instead. You can easily get confused and select the wrong combination of drivers when you’re enabling each line individually.   ? 6.0 and later—Internal  605  2. The question mark  ?  must come between the command and the equal sign, with no  spaces between it and the command name.  3. Each line you have marked for confirmation is displayed followed by [Y,N]?. Enter Y to  execute the line and N to skip it.  4. Pressing the F8 key when DOS displays the Starting MS-DOS... message causes DOS  to prompt you for confirmation of every line in your CONFIG.SYS file, whether or not the line includes a question mark.  5. DOS doesn’t necessarily process the lines in CONFIG.SYS in the order they appear in the  file, which can be confusing when you receive a prompt for a line near the end of the file before being prompted for a line at the beginning. In general, DOS processes com- mands such as DOS=, FILES=, and BUFFERS= before it begins to load any of your device drivers. However, after DOS begins processing the DEVICE=  and DEVICEHIGH=  lines, it loads them in the order they appear in the file.  Examples  Messages  To instruct DOS to prompt you before setting up a 1.4MB RAM disk in extended memory, place a question mark in the line that loads the RAMDRIVE.SYS driver as follows: DEVICEHIGH?=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS  1450  512  224   E  If MemMaker has optimized your CONFIG.SYS file,  L and  S switches may appear on the DEVICEHIGH line. Make sure you place the ? directly after the command name, as shown here, not before the equal sign: DEVICEHIGH?   L:1,1200   S  =C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS  1450  512  224   E  If you place the ? incorrectly in a CONFIG.SYS command, you will receive one of the follow- ing error messages when you reboot: Bad command or parameter - ?= Error in CONFIG.SYS line   Edit your CONFIG.SYS file and make sure that all your question marks  ?  are placed directly after the name of the command, with no intervening spaces.  App F  or Bad or Missing ? Error in CONFIG.SYS line   See Also  ;, [blockname], and MENUITEM=  Chapter 2, “Starting DOS”   606  Appendix F  Command Reference  [blockname]  CONFIG  SYS  6.0 and later—Internal  Defining blocks in CONFIG.SYS is part of the multiple configuration feature in DOS 6. By naming blocks of commands, you can choose which blocks to execute from a menu when you start your computer.  Syntax  [blockname]  Notes  1. The name for a block can be up to 70 characters long and contain any legal filename  characters. You cannot use spaces in block names, so you might want to consider using underscores  _  or hyphens  -  to separate words and make your block names more readable. Upper- and lowercase characters are considered the same. The name must be surrounded by square brackets  [ and ]  and appear on a line by itself. Any commands that follow the block name are considered to be part of that block until the next [blockname] is encountered in the file.  2. Blocks cannot be embedded inside each other. When DOS encounters another block  name in the CONFIG.SYS file, it considers the preceding block to be complete.  3. Any block never referred to by a MENUITEM= line is never executed by DOS. Exceptions  are the predefined block names [MENU] and [COMMON].  4. The [MENU] block defines entries for the main startup menu and should contain the  configuration menu that you want DOS to display when the computer starts up. DOS always executes this block.  5. Commands in a [COMMON] block are always executed by DOS. [COMMON] also is the only  block that you are allowed to define more than once in your CONFIG.SYS file. A [COMMON] block located before the [MENU] block is run before the startup menu is displayed. Similarly, a [COMMON] block located at the end of your CONFIG.SYS file is executed after all other blocks.  6. Any commands that you include in CONFIG.SYS before the first block name are consid- ered to be part of a [COMMON] block. As far as DOS is concerned, CONFIG.SYS files that don’t use multiple configuration features are simply one big [COMMON] block.  7. Microsoft recommends that you include a [COMMON] block command at the end of your  CONFIG.SYS file, even if you don’t need to place any commands in it. Many software installation programs modify your CONFIG.SYS file by adding to the end of the file the settings the software requires. With a [COMMON] block defined at the end, these added commands are run when you start your system; without [COMMONBLOCK], these added commands might never run at all.   [blockname] 6.0 and later—Internal  607  Examples  Suppose that you want to set up a menu that enables you to choose among three basic con- figurations for your computer: Windows, DOS, and Maintenance. Begin by adding a menu block like this at the beginning of your CONFIG.SYS file with the predefined block name [MENU]:  [MENU] MENUITEM=WIN, Configure for Windows  Default  MENUITEM=DOS, Configure for MS-DOS MENUITEM=MAINT, Configure for File & Disk Maintenance  When these lines are included in your CONFIG.SYS file, DOS searches for blocks named [WIN], [DOS], and [MAINT]. You also might want to include a [COMMON] block that contains any commands that you always want executed, as in this example: [COMMON] DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM MIN=0 DOS=HIGH,UMB BREAK=ON FILES=50 DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\  P  E:512  [WIN] BUFFERS=10  [DOS] BUFFERS=10 DEVICE=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS 1450 512 224  E  [MAINT] BUFFERS=30 DEVICE=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS 1450 512 224  E  [COMMON]  Include a [COMMON] block at the end of your CONFIG.SYS file. That way, any commands added to the file by software installation programs are executed, no matter what configuration you choose. Without the final [COMMON] block, any commands that are added to the end of the file are executed only when you choose the maintenance configuration because they are part of the [MAINT] block.  App F  DOS displays a startup menu that looks something like this: MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu =====================  1. Configure for Windows  Default  2. Configure for MS-DOS 3. Configure for File & Disk Maintenance  Enter a choice: 1   608  Appendix F  Command Reference  Entering 1, 2, or 3 at this menu tells DOS to select the [WIN], [DOS], and [MAINT] blocks, respectively. DOS sets the CONFIG environment variable equal to the name of the configura- tion block you selected from the startup menu.  In this example, you might be able to better understand the small differences between these three configurations if you look at a few lines from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file: IF “%CONFIG%”==”MAINT” GOTO SET_TEMP C:\DOS\SMARTDRV  :SET_TEMP SET TEMP=C:\TEMP SET TMP=C:\TEMP  IF NOT “%CONFIG%”==”WIN” GOTO THE_REST MD D:\TEMP SET TEMP=D:\TEMP SET TMP=D:\TEMP  :THE_REST  The SMARTDrive disk cache is loaded if you are using the DOS or Windows configura- tions, which is why so few DOS buffers are needed  BUFFERS=10 . The Maintenance configu- ration does not have a disk cache, so the number of DOS buffers is set to 30.  Similarly, the Windows configuration doesn’t use a RAM drive; therefore, the TEMP  and TMP  environment variables are set pointing to the C:\TEMP subdirectory, instructing programs to create any temporary files they require in that subdirectory. When a RAM drive is present, temporary files are written to the RAM drive instead.  See Also  ? and MENUITEM=  “Creating Multiple Configurations” in Chapter 2  CONFIG  SYS  DEVICE =  ANSI.SYS  device driver  2.0 and later—External ANSI.SYS is a device driver that provides a subset of the commands defined by the American National Standards Institute  ANSI  for controlling video displays and keyboards. ANSI.SYS enables you to control cursor positioning, display colors, video modes, and keyboard map- ping. To use it, you must load ANSI.SYS with a DEVICE= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. ANSI.SYS replaces the default CON driver provided by the MS-DOS kernel.  Syntax  DEVICE=drive:\path\ANSI.SYS  X   K   R  or DEVICEHIGH=drive:\path\ANSI.SYS  X   K   R   ANSI.SYS  device driver   2.0 and later—External  609  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  Indicates the full path to the ANSI.SYS file on your system. Setup places the ANSI.SYS file in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to ANSI.SYS isn’t specified, DOS looks for the file in the root directory of the startup drive.  Enables you to remap extended keys if you are using a 101-key keyboard.  Forces ANSI.SYS to treat a 101-key keyboard as if it were an 84-key keyboard, which is a handy feature with older TSR programs that don’t recognize  the new keycodes properly. Using this switch is the same as specifying SWITCHES= K. If you are using the SWITCHES= K switch already, you also  should include the  K option in the DEVICE= line that loads ANSI.SYS.  Slows down the line scrolling rate so that lines on the display are more read- able. Chances are, you won’t notice any difference when you use this switch because the scrolling rate doesn’t change that much. Microsoft claims this switch can aid screen-reading programs that make computers more accessible to people with disabilities.   X   K   R  Notes  1. You can load ANSI.SYS with either the  X or  R switch, but not both. These two functions  are mutually exclusive.  2. ANSI.SYS occupies about 4KB of memory in your computer and can be loaded into upper  memory with the DEVICEHIGH command.  3. Note that all ANSI commands begin with the Escape character and are case sensitive. After  it is loaded, ANSI.SYS scans all text that is written to the screen, looking for commands.  4. The MODE command requires ANSI.SYS to be loaded in order to change the number of text lines displayed on your screen. MODE can switch between color and monochrome adapters, however, without ANSI.SYS.  5. When it’s loaded, ANSI.SYS resets your screen colors to the default  white on black . If  you’ve set screen colors with the MENUCOLOR= command, they are reset when ANSI.SYS loads into memory. If this is a problem, either insert an ANSI command into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to reset your screen colors or load ANSI.SYS from a [COMMON] block located before your [MENU] block in CONFIG.SYS.  6. All ANSI commands begin with an Escape character  ASCII 27 . When you press the Esc key at the DOS prompt, DOS interprets that as a request to cancel the current command line, so you cannot simply send ANSI commands from the command line by typing them. To get around this problem, people often use PROMPT to send ANSI commands. Another alternative is to place the ANSI commands in a file and then copy the file to the console like this: COPY  ANSI_CMD.TXT  CON  7. Chapter 17, “Understanding ANSI.SYS,” provides a list of all the ANSI commands   supported by ANSI.SYS.  App F   610  Appendix F  Command Reference  Examples  To use the PROMPT command to set your screen colors to blue on white, you would enter the following command: PROMPT  $e[34;47m$p$g  Some people like to create very elaborate DOS prompts with ANSI.SYS. For example, enter- ing the command PROMPT  $e[s$e[H$d$e[0;68H$t$e[u”Good morning Mr. Phelps”$_$p$g  changes the DOS prompt to display the current date in the upper-left corner of the screen and the time in the upper-right corner; it also creates a two-line prompt that starts with Good morning Mr. Phelps and then has the familiar C:\> on the following line. Notice that case is significant in ANSI commands, and the preceding command does not work if, for example, you type E rather than e.  See Also  DEVICE= and PROMPT  Chapter 17, “Understanding ANSI.SYS”   C:\>  BATCH  FILE  DEVICE =  T S R  APPEND  3.3 and later—External You can use the APPEND command to set up a search path that enables DOS to find data files even if they’re not in the current directory. The subdirectories in the APPEND path are appended to the current directory when DOS searches for data files. APPEND was developed so that programs requiring you to make their program directories current can be run from the subdirectory that contains their data files rather than the one that contains their pro- gram files.  Syntax  To load APPEND into memory: APPEND  X:onoff   E  or APPEND path1;path2;...  X:onoff  PATH:onoff  To replace and or set the appended directory search path: APPEND path1;path2;...  X:onoff  PATH:onoff  To clear the appended directory search path:  APPEND ;  APPEND  To display the current appended directory search path:   APPEND  3.3 and later—External  611  Parameters and Switches  path1;path2;... Each path specifies a valid subdirectory that exists on your system. Use full, absolute pathnames that include drive letters for each subdirectory included in your appended directory search path; the current subdirectory and disk drive often change. Separate each subdirectory from the previous one with a semicolon  ; .   E   X:onoff   PATH:onoff  Notes  Stores the appended directory search path in an environment variable named APPEND rather than internally. With this switch specified, you can use SET to view or change the appended directory search path. You can specify this option only when you first load APPEND into memory.  Specifies whether DOS is to search appended directories   X or  X:ON  or not   X:OFF  when executing programs. Directories on the APPEND path are searched before those specified with the PATH command. To use this feature, you must specify it when you load APPEND into memory, after which you can toggle it on   X or  X:ON  and off   X:OFF .  Normally, if you specify a full pathname for a file, DOS searches only that directory.  PATH:ON instructs DOS to search the appended directories even if the full pathname of the file is given.  PATH:OFF turns off this feature.  1. The first time you run APPEND, it loads itself into memory as a TSR program, occupying  about 5KB of memory. APPEND does not remove itself from memory until you restart DOS.  2. After you load APPEND into memory, do not specify the .EXE file extension. At this point,  APPEND is resident in memory and will not load more than once.  3. You can use the  E switches only when you first load APPEND into memory, and you cannot  specify any search paths on the same line. In other words, if you want the APPEND path to be stored in the environment, you have to run the command twice—once with  E and then again to set your appended directory search path.  4. To use the  X switch, you must specify it in the line that loads APPEND into memory. After APPEND is loaded with this feature enabled, you can toggle it on and off by using  X:ON and  X:OFF.  5. Each path you specify in the appended directory search path must be separated by a semi- colon. Don’t include any spaces between paths. The total length of the appended directory search path cannot exceed 127 characters.  6. When DOS looks for a data file, it first searches the current directory and then the  appended directories in the order you specified them. If DOS encounters an invalid path, it skips that path without displaying any error messages.  7. Do not use APPEND when running Microsoft Windows or Windows Setup. 8. APPEND can’t change the environment being used by running applications, so the  E switch does not work with shell programs, such as DOSSHELL, XTree, or Norton Commander. To  App F   612  Appendix F  Command Reference  work with these types of programs, APPEND must store the appended directory search path internally  in other words, don’t specify  E .  9. The DIR command ignores the appended directory search path and never displays files  from appended directories.  10. APPEND ignores any drive assignments made with the ASSIGN command. To use both util- ities, you must load APPEND into memory before using ASSIGN; otherwise, an error mes- sage appears.  11. DOS searches the appended directories when it opens files requested through Interrupt 21h functions 0Fh  Open File , 3Dh  Open File Handle , and 23h  Get File Size . When  X or  X:ON is specified, functions 11h  Find First Entry , 4Eh  Find First File , and 4Bh  Execute Program  search the appended directories as well.  APPEND is intended for locating and reading files, but not for writing them. Any files written to disk are placed in the current subdirectory, no matter what subdirectory they originally were read from. This capability works out well for program overlay and help files, which are rarely written to, but can be very frustrating if APPEND starts scattering data files all over your hard disk.  Examples  The following line loads APPEND into memory, enables searching for executable files in appended directories, and stores the active APPEND path in the environment. This line assumes that the file APPEND.EXE is located in the C:\DOS subdirectory: C:\DOS\APPEND   X   E  To instruct DOS to search the current directory, C:\BIN, and C:\BIN\OVR when opening data files, enter the following command: APPEND  C:\BIN;C:\BIN\OVR  When the program that needed data file path support terminates, disable APPEND by using the following command: APPEND  ;  To reactivate APPEND, simply specify a new APPEND path.  Messages  APPEND ASSIGN conflict  Error: You tried to load APPEND after reassigning disk drives with ASSIGN. Break any disk drive reassignments you may have set, load APPEND, and then reset your ASSIGN settings. APPEND already installed  Warning: You attempted to load APPEND a second time.

File attributes flag files that have to be backed up, control whether a file can be written to, and hide files from view. With ATTRIB, you can view or change the attributes associated with a particular file.  App F   614  Appendix F  Command Reference  Syntax  Use this syntax to display the attributes currently set for a file or group of files: ATTRIB pathname  S  Use this syntax to set or clear attributes for a file or group of files: ATTRIB +- A  +-R  +-S  +-H  pathname  S  Parameters and Switches  +- A  +- R  +- S  +- H  pathname   S  Notes  Sets  +A  or clears  -A  the archive attribute for all files matching the path- name specified. By default, new files always have their archive attribute turned on. DOS sets this attribute each time a file is written to.  Sets  +R  or clears  -R  the read-only attribute for all files matching the pathname specified. Marking a file as read-only can prevent COPY from overwriting it, but many programs can override this flag.  Sets  +S  or clears  -S  the system attribute for all files matching the path- name specified. Few files use this attribute. It flags the hidden MS-DOS system files that are in the root directory of your startup disk drive.  Sets  +H  or clears  -H  the hidden attribute for all files matching the path- name specified. A file with the hidden attribute normally does not show up in a listing of the files in a directory. ATTRIB enables you to set the hidden flag for subdirectories as well as for files.  Indicates the file or files that you want ATTRIB to display information about. Wildcards are allowed in the filename portion. If no pathname is specified, all files  *.*  in the current directory are displayed. If no filename is speci- fied, ATTRIB displays or changes the attributes of that subdirectory. Notice that the root directory has no attributes and therefore cannot be changed.  Searches for files in the specified subdirectory and all subdirectories  below it.  1. If a file has either the hidden or system attribute set, you must clear that attribute  before you can change any other attributes for the file. Otherwise, you are denied access to the file  see the following “Messages” section . If a single file has both the system and hidden attributes set, you must clear both attributes with a single ATTRIB command to avoid being denied access to the file.  2. Normally, ATTRIB only displays or alters the attributes of files. To change the attributes of a subdirectory, you must enter the full pathname for that subdirectory on the com- mand line with ATTRIB. You cannot use wildcards when you are specifying subdirecto- ries.   ATTRIB  3.0 and later—External  615  Commas can make strange things happen with ATTRIB. If you include a comma in an ATTRIB command, as shown here, ATTRIB clears all the attributes for all the files in the current directory: ATTRIB  ,  If you also include the  S switch, as in the following example, ATTRIB clears the attributes of all the files on your hard disk, not just the ones below the current directory: ATTRIB  ,   S  This problem has been confirmed by Microsoft and is present in DOS 5 versions of ATTRIB as well.  Examples  To display the attributes of all the .TXT files in the C:\MYWORK subdirectory, you would enter the following: ATTRIB  C:\MYWORK\*.TXT  If you want to extend the search to include any subdirectories under the subdirectory, you would include the  S switch, as in the following: ATTRIB  C:\MYWORK\*.TXT   S  To set the archive bit on for all the files you found so that MSBACKUP will be sure to back them up the next time you run it, enter the following: ATTRIB  +A C:\MYWORK\*.TXT   S  To clear all the attributes of all the files in the root directory of drive C:, including the  MS-DOS system files, enter the following: ATTRIB  -A  -R  -H  -S  C:\*.*  To hide the C:\SECRET subdirectory so that it no longer shows up in directory listings, enter the following: ATTRIB  +H  C:\SECRET  Messages  Not resetting hidden file Not resetting system file  Error: ATTRIB is unable to set or clear the attributes you’ve requested because the file has either the hidden or system attribute set. To get around this problem, clear the hidden or system attribute for that file first  for example, use ATTRIB  -H -S ; then retry the com- mand.

You could use it to back up files from your hard disk drive to a series of floppy disks. It created a special file on each backup disk, a file that could be read only by the RESTORE utility. RESTORE, however, would often refuse to restore files if anything went wrong with your disks. With MS-DOS 6.0, Microsoft began distributing the new MSBACKUP program. If you still want to use the old BACKUP utility, Microsoft has included it on the DOS 6 Supplemental Disk.  See Also  MSBACKUP and RESTORE  BREAK BREAK=  2.0 and later—Internal 2.0 and later—Internal  When DOS detects a Ctrl+Break  or Ctrl+C , it attempts to stop the program that is cur- rently running. DOS checks for a Ctrl+Break after performing any screen, keyboard, or printer I O operation. Turning BREAK ON or setting BREAK=ON in your CONFIG.SYS file instructs DOS to check for Ctrl+Break after performing disk I O operations as well. This way, you can regain control more quickly when you are trying to stop disk-oriented DOS commands.  Syntax  BREAK=onoff  BREAK onoff  In CONFIG.SYS, to set extended Ctrl+Break checking on or off, use the following format:  To turn extended Ctrl+Break checking on or off from the command line, use the following format:  Parameters and Switches  onoff  Specifies whether you want extended Ctrl+Break checking to be turned on  or off. The only legal values for the onoff parameter are ON and OFF. In the  CONFIG.SYS form of this command, this parameter is required. If you omit the onoff parameter when you run BREAK from the command line, the current state of extended Ctrl+Break checking is displayed.  Notes  1. When DOS starts, it sets extended Ctrl+Break checking off by default. 2. Set BREAK=ON in your CONFIG.SYS file. The speed penalty is negligible, and if this setting  saves just one file from a mistyped COPY command, it is well worthwhile. Most long   BUFFERS=  2.0 and later—Internal  617  operations involve reading or writing to disk. If BREAK is off, you may be unable to stop a lengthy process you would rather not wait for.  3. In most cases, pressing Ctrl+C produces the same effect as pressing Ctrl+Break, but there is a subtle difference. The Ctrl+C key combination is passed through the key- board buffer. If any other key is pressed before Ctrl+C, it is ignored until the program reads the keyboard. For example, DIR stops if you press Ctrl+C, but not if you press the spacebar and then Ctrl+C. Ctrl+Break is passed directly to DOS without buffering and often gets a quicker response.  4. In theory, turning on extended Ctrl+Break checking should slow down your system. In  practice, any slowdown is so insignificant that you probably will never notice it.  5. Programs have complete control over what happens when a Ctrl+Break is detected. The  default action is for the running program to be halted, but applications often disable Ctrl+Break so that you can save your work before exiting. Typically, short command- line utilities respond to Ctrl+Break, whereas most full-screen applications do not.  6. The state of the BREAK flag can be changed by a running program. Programming eti-  quette dictates that when an application finishes running, it should reset all flags to their original states. Still, you may run across applications that forget to reset BREAK. If this causes problems, you can run the application from a batch file that restores the BREAK flag setting when the program terminates.  See Also VERIFY  “Telling DOS When to Break” in Chapter 19  BUFFERS=  CONFIG  SYS  2.0 and later—Internal  DOS stores any information read from or written to disk in memory buffers. With more buffers available, it is more likely that DOS already has in memory the data requested by a program. The BUFFERS= command enables you to fine-tune your system so that DOS can perform disk I O as efficiently as possible. BUFFERS= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  App F  Syntax  BUFFERS=number,read_ahead  Parameters and Switches  number  The number of disk buffers DOS should use, from 1 to 99. The default value varies depending on the amount of memory in your computer. Normally, 15 is used for a computer with at least 512KB of RAM.   618  Appendix F  Command Reference  read_ahead The number of buffers in the secondary, read-ahead cache. For DOS 5.0, this  value could be from 1 to 8, with a default value of 1. In DOS 6.0, you can specify zero secondary cache buffers, and 0 is the default value.  Notes  1. Each disk buffer uses approximately 532 bytes of memory. If DOS is loaded HIGH, it attempts to locate these buffers in the HMA as well. About 48 buffers can fit in the HMA with DOS 6. If you have specified more buffers than can fit in the HMA, DOS loads them all into conventional memory.  Make sure that you explicitly set the number of DOS buffers in your CONFIG.SYS file. If you aren’t using disk-caching software, the default for BUFFERS  usually 15  is too low. You may be slowing down your computer by not requesting more.  2. If you are using disk-caching software, such as SMARTDRV.EXE, you might want to  decrease the number of buffers that DOS uses. A dedicated disk cache is much more efficient at optimizing disk access time than the simple memory buffers that DOS uses, and having several DOS buffers can slow your system. In this situation, set the number of buffers fairly low—using only 15 or 20.  3. Although the perfect setting for buffers can be found only through trial and error, a  good place to start is to use half the size of your hard disk  in megabytes , adjusted to be in the range of 15 to 55. For example, if you have an 80MB drive, a good setting might be 40. With large drives, you may be tempted to specify a higher number of buffers, but under normal circumstances, using a number higher than 50 hurts rather than helps performance.  4. The secondary read-ahead buffer setting can give you a performance boost if you aren’t  running any other caching software. Because many programs read files sequentially, DOS can perform fewer disk accesses by reading in more information than was request- ed. The number of read-ahead buffers you specify is the amount of data that DOS reads from disk in addition to the data requested by a program. Cache software, such as SMARTDRV.EXE, usually includes much more sophisticated read- ahead capabilities than DOS can provide. If you are using any cache software, you should turn off this feature by letting DOS default to zero read-ahead buffers.  See Also  DOS=HIGH, FASTOPEN, FILES, HIMEM.SYS, and SMARTDRV.EXE  Chapter 19, “Configuring Your Computer”   CALL  3.3 and later—Internal  619  CALL  BATCH  FILE  3.3 and later—Internal You can use the CALL command to execute a second batch file and return control to the first batch file. CALL normally is used to replace the awkward COMMAND  C syntax that was required before DOS 3.3. CALL can be used to run any executable file, but there is no reason to use it for .COM or .EXE files because they return control automatically. If you execute a batch file from a batch file without using CALL, control is never returned.  Syntax  CALL  drive:\path\filename parameters  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\ or path is specified, the DOS PATH is searched for filename.  The drive and or path to the batch file you want to execute. If no drive  filename The filename of the batch file you want to execute. This argument is required and wildcards cannot be used. You are not required to enter the .BAT extension, but you can include it if you want to ensure that a batch file, rather than an executable file, is found.  parameters Any parameters that you want passed to the batch file you are executing.  Notes  1. When you use the CALL command to execute a batch file from within a batch file, con-  trol returns to the first batch file when the second one terminates. If you execute a batch file from within a batch file without the CALL command, control never returns to the first batch file.  2. Any parameters specified are passed to the called batch file. You can access these   parameters from within the called batch file by using replaceable parameters  for exam- ple, %1  as usual.  3. Avoid using redirection symbols   , and >>  or the pipe character    in the   parameters you pass to the batch file with the CALL command. DOS ignores any redi- rection operations you specify, which might cause some programs  such as MORE  to lock up or crash.  4. Although the CALL command is very similar to the COMMAND  C command, it has one sig- nificant difference: CALL doesn’t execute a temporary copy of the command interpreter, whereas COMMAND  C does. For this reason, CALL requires less memory to use.  5. If you use CALL to call a program that returns an exit code, that exit code value will be available after CALL returns. Unfortunately, you can’t set the exit code for a batch file,  so CALL can’t return an exit code from a batch file you have executed. To return status information from a batch file executed with the CALL command, create an environment variable and set it equal to your return status. You then can test this environment vari- able in the calling batch file.  App F   620  Appendix F  Command Reference  6. A batch file executed with the CALL command uses the same copy of the command  interpreter that its parent is using; therefore, they share access to the same environment area. Any environment variables you set in the called batch file can be read by the par- ent batch file when it regains control. This is not true when you use COMMAND  C. The environment of a batch file executed with COMMAND  C disappears when the temporary copy of the command interpreter it is running under is removed from memory.  7. If you are going to load any resident software from a called batch file, make sure you use CALL rather than COMMAND  C. When you return from COMMAND  C, the temporary copy of the command interpreter is unloaded from memory. If you load any resident software while this temporary copy is running, the memory occupied by the temporary command interpreter remains unavailable until you reboot your computer. This “mem- ory loss” doesn’t happen with the CALL command because no temporary copy of the command interpreter is loaded.  8. A batch file can call itself, but you must be careful to explicitly terminate the batch file  at some point to avoid an endless loop. A batch file can be terminated by instructing the user to press Ctrl+Break at a PAUSE or by executing another batch file  without CALL  at some point.  9. Although executing a .COM or .EXE file with the CALL command is perfectly legal, there  is little reason to do so. After a .COM or .EXE file is executed, control returns to the batch file with or without using the CALL command. Executing the CALL command from the DOS prompt, although legal, is fairly useless unless it is part of a FOR-IN-DO loop.  Examples  To call a batch file from another batch file, simply include the name of the batch file in a CALL command, as shown in the following: CALL  OTHER.BAT  Note that you can omit the .BAT extension; however, if DOS locates an .EXE or .COM file named OTHER, it executes that program rather than your batch file. DOS searches the current directory as well as any subdirectories listed in your DOS PATH looking for OTHER.BAT. To save time by limiting DOS’s search, you can specify the full pathname of the batch file.  Arguments can be passed to the called batch file. Suppose that you previously wrote a batch file named COPYDOC.BAT, which copied all the .DOC files in a subdirectory  %1  to a flop- py disk  %2 . The project you are working on is stored in five separate subdirectories, and you want to write a batch file, as shown in the following example, that runs COPYDOC once for each subdirectory: @ECHO OFF CALL COPYDOC.BAT C:\PROJECT\WORK B: CALL COPYDOC.BAT C:\PROJECT\LTR B: CALL COPYDOC.BAT C:\PROJECT\EXPN B: CALL COPYDOC.BAT C:\PROJECT\RES B: CALL COPYDOC.BAT C:\PROJECT\OLD B: ECHO *** All Done ***   CD or CHDIR  2.0 and later—Internal  621  Each CALL command executes COPYDOC with different parameters, backing up all five of the C:\PROJECT subdirectories. After all the copy commands are executed, the message *** All Done *** is displayed onscreen. If you execute the COPYDOC.BAT file without using CALL, the batch file is terminated after backing up one subdirectory because control never returns to this batch file from COPYDOC.BAT.  To eliminate the repetition in the preceding example, you can combine all five CALL com- mands into a single FOR-IN-DO loop, as shown in the following: @ECHO OFF FOR %%A IN  WORK LTR EXPN RES OLD  DO CALL COPYDOC.BAT C:\PROJECT\%%A B: ECHO *** All Done ***  Note that you can execute this FOR command from the command line, as long as you remember to substitute single percent signs for the double ones that are required in batch files, like this: FOR %A IN  WORK LTR EXPN RES OLD  DO CALL COPYDOC.BAT C:\PROJECT\%A B:  Messages  Batch file missing  Error: DOS attempted to read the next line from the batch file it was executing and was unable to find the file. This error can happen if you execute a batch file from a floppy disk and change disks before the batch file has finished. The batch file may have renamed or deleted itself, in which case you have to edit it to avoid this behavior.  See Also  COMMAND  “Running Batch Files from Other Batch Files” in Chapter 16  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  CD or CHDIR  2.0 and later—Internal  Each disk drive has one subdirectory that is referred to as the current directory. When a pathname contains no subdirectories, DOS assumes the current directory for that drive is being referenced. The CD  or CHDIR  command enables you to display or change the current directory for a disk drive.  App F  Syntax  CD  drive:\path  or CHDIR drive:\path   622  Appendix F  Command Reference  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path The subdirectory  path  on a particular drive: that you want to make cur- rent. If only a path is specified, it becomes the current directory on the cur- rent drive. If only a drive: is specified, the name of the current subdirectory on that drive is displayed. If this parameter is omitted, the name of the cur- rent directory of the current drive is displayed.  Notes  1. If a backslash  \  is the first  or only  character in a subdirectory path, it is considered  an absolute path and is specified starting from the root directory. If the subdirectory path begins with a subdirectory name, it is considered a relative path, and the current direc- tory is used as the starting point. A drive letter, followed by a colon, can precede either an absolute or relative path.  2. Two periods  ..  represent the parent of the current directory. A common shorthand with the CD command is to switch to the parent directory by using a CD .. command. The “double-dot” can be used in any pathname, but it is more useful in relative path- names than in absolute ones. Notice that the root directory has no parent; attempting to switch to the parent of the root directory  for example, CD \..  causes an error mes- sage to be displayed.  See the first item in the following “Messages” section.   3. Do not specify a filename with the CD  or CHDIR  command; otherwise, DOS interprets  the filename as a subdirectory name and displays an error message.  See the first item in the following “Messages” section.   4. You must include a colon after the drive letter; otherwise, DOS interprets the drive let- ter as a subdirectory name and displays an error message.  See the first item in the fol- lowing “Messages” section.   Examples  To change to the root directory of the current drive, enter CD  or CHDIR  followed by a back- slash: CD  \  To change to the parent or the current directory, enter CD followed by two periods: CD  ..  If the current directory was the root directory, switching to the parent directory with the preceding command causes an Invalid directory message to be displayed  because the root directory has no parent .  See the first item in the following “Messages” section.   For the next set of examples, assume the following directory tree:  C:\  DOS  TEMP   CD or CHDIR  2.0 and later—Internal  623  WIN  WORK  SYSTEM  STEVE  ALICE  Enter the following command to display the current directory on drive C: CD  C:  If you omit the C:, the current directory of the current drive is displayed. Assuming that drive C is the current drive, you enter the following command to change to the C:\WORK\STEVE subdirectory: CD  \WORK\STEVE  Then, if you want to change to the C:\WORK\ALICE subdirectory, you can use either of the following two commands: CD  \WORK\ALICE  or CD  ..\ALICE  The second line uses the “double-dot” directory to specify a relative path to the new subdi- rectory. It is interpreted as “the subdirectory ALICE of the parent of the current directory.”  Relative pathnames can get very convoluted. If C:\WORK\ALICE is the current drive and direc- tory, and you want to change to the C:\WIN\SYSTEM subdirectory, enter one of the following commands: CD  ..\..\WIN\SYSTEM  or CD  ..\STEVE\..\..\DOS\..\WIN\SYSTEM  The preceding examples can help you understand how DOS interprets relative pathnames, but using absolute pathnames is much easier when you want to move to a remote part of the subdirectory structure.  App F  Messages  Invalid directory  Error: You have used the path argument to specify a directory that doesn’t exist.

See “International Country Codes” in Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS,” for a list of the code pages that MS-DOS supports.  Notes  1. Before using CHCP, you must use the COUNTRY command  to specify the location of the  country-information file, normally COUNTRY.SYS , use the NLSFUNC command  to specify  a location that overrides that of the COUNTRY command , or place COUNTRY.SYS in the root directory of the current disk. Otherwise, DOS returns the message Cannot open specified country information file.   CHCP  3.3 and later—Internal  625  2. Before using CHCP, you must use the NLSFUNC command. 3. When you select a code page, the new code page becomes the specified code page.   If you include CONFIG.SYS directives for devices that use code pages, such as DEVICE=DISPLAY.SYS, CHCP loads the correct code pages for the devices.  4. You can access the COUNTRY.SYS file to get country information. If you do not specify  the location of COUNTRY.SYS when you invoke NLSFUNC, COUNTRY.SYS must exist in  the current disk’s root directory. Otherwise, DOS returns the message Cannot open specified country information file.

ScanDisk can identify and fix many more types of errors than CHKDSK. If you use DoubleSpace, ScanDisk can identify and fix any errors it finds on your compressed drives as well.  3. In DOS 4.0 and later, CHKDSK also reports the following information:    Total bytes in each allocation unit   Total allocation units on the disk   Available allocation units on the disk  an allocation unit equates to a cluster   4. CHKDSK checks the directories and the FAT of a disk. The command also checks the  amount of memory in the system and determines how much of that memory is free. If errors are found, CHKDSK reports them onscreen before making a status report.  5. If lost clusters are found, CHKDSK asks whether you want to repair them. You must type Y  or N. If you type Y, CHKDSK shows a report onscreen as though the lost clusters were repaired. This report is only a simulation, however. To actually reclaim the lost clusters, you must issue a second command: CHKDSK  F.  6. The CHKDSK filename checks to see whether the specified files are stored contiguously  on the disk. DOS reports any noncontiguously stored files and how many different sec- tions store the files. If CHKDSK reports many noncontiguous files, you might want to run DEFRAG on the disk.  7.

Warning: directoryname contains so much bad information that the directory no longer is usable. If you type Y, CHKDSK converts the directory into a file so that you can use DEBUG or another tool to repair the directory. If you type N, no action is taken.  The first time you see this message, type N. Try to copy files from this directory to another disk and check the copied files to see whether they are usable.

The blocks are lost clusters, which CHKDSK normally can free if no other error or warning message appears.  If you use the  F switch and type Y, CHKDSK joins each set of lost chains into a file placed in the root directory of the disk. That file is called FILExxxx.CHK, in which xxxx is a consecu- tive number between 0000 and 9999. Examine this file and delete any clusters that contain no useful information.  If you use the  F switch and type N, CHKDSK simply frees the lost chains so that other files can reuse the disk space. No files are created. If you type Y and omit  F, CHKDSK displays the actions that you can take but takes no action itself.

MemMaker requires this driver only while optimizing your system; it’s not needed at any other time. You should not attempt to use this device driver yourself.  Very few details about CHKSTATE.SYS’s operation are documented. It’s loaded into memory  by MemMaker with a DEVICE= line in your CONFIG.SYS file during the optimization process. Presumably, CHKSTATE.SYS communicates with MEMMAKER about the state of your computer, verifying that system integrity is not violated as different combinations of drivers are loaded. When optimization is complete, MemMaker removes this driver from the CONFIG.SYS file.

C:YN, for example, produces the prompt [Y,N]?  2. CHOICE returns different exit code values to the batch file, depending on which of the keys in  C:keys is pressed in response to the prompt. Pressing the first key returns 1, pressing the second returns 2, and so on.  3. If the user presses Ctrl+Break and then does not terminate the batch job, a value of 0 is  returned. If DOS detects an error, a value of 255 is returned.  4. If the user presses a key that is not one of the keys in  C:keys, the computer beeps.

Multiple configurations are identified and handled without user intervention.  COMMAND  BATCH  FILE  2.0 and later—External COMMAND invokes another copy of COMMAND.COM, the command processor. If you write compli- cated batch files, this command may be useful. Normally, a user gets involved with this com- mand when setting up the SHELL= line in the CONFIG.SYS file.  Notes  Syntax  COMMAND path\  cttydevice  E:size  K filename  P   MSG   C string  In your CONFIG.SYS file, use the following format: SHELL=drive:\path\COMMAND.COM path\  condevice  E:size  P   MSG  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  Indicates the DOS drive and path to the copy of COMMAND.COM that the SHELL= command should load.  Indicates the drive and directory location of COMMAND.COM. This path is assigned to the COMSPEC environment variable.  Indicates the device used for input and output. The default is CON:. The colon is optional. This parameter rarely is used.  Sets the size of the environment. size is a decimal number from 160 to 32,768 bytes, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 16  refer to the SHELL command . The default is 256.   K filename  Runs filename  a program or batch file  and then displays the DOS command prompt.  Keeps this copy permanently in memory  until the next system reset . Generally used only as part of the SHELL command. Do not use the  P parameter from a batch file.  Loads all error messages into memory. Must be used with  P. Generally useful only if you are running DOS from floppy disks.  Passes the command and parameters represented by string to the new copy of COMMAND.COM and returns to the primary command processor.  App F  path\  condevice   E:size   P   MSG   C string   636  Appendix F  Command Reference  Rules  Notes  1. The string in the  C option is interpreted by the additional copy of COMMAND.COM, just as  though you typed the string at the system level.  C must be the last switch used in the line. Do not use the form COMMAND C string  P.  2. You can exit from the second copy of the command processor by issuing the command  EXIT, unless you used the  P option  permanent .  3. If you issue the  P and  C switches together,  P is ignored. 4. Do not use the  K switch in the SHELL command line in your CONFIG.SYS file. This  switch can cause problems with applications and installation programs that alter your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  1. COMMAND often is used with the SHELL directive to enable COMMAND.COM to reside in a sub-  directory rather than in the root directory.  2. You can use COMMAND with all versions of DOS to call a second batch file from an origi-  nating batch file. Suppose that a batch file named BATCH1.BAT contains the following line: COMMAND   C  BATCH2 BATCH1 calls BATCH2.BAT. BATCH2.BAT executes and, after completing the last line of the batch file, returns to BATCH1 to complete the originating batch file. This method of call- ing a batch file is similar to the CALL batch subcommand available in DOS version 3.3 and later.  3. If you use DOS 5.0 or 6.0 with a floppy-disk–only system, you can specify the  MSG switch in the SHELL directive of CONFIG.SYS. This switch loads all error messages in memory. If an error occurs, you do not need a disk with COMMAND.COM in the drive.  The switch uses an additional 1KB of RAM.   4. You can use the  K filename switch to specify that the DOS prompt in Microsoft  Windows should use a startup file other than AUTOEXEC.BAT. Open the DOSPRMPT.PIF file  using the PIF Editor  and type  K filename in the Optional Parameters box.  See Also  CALL and SHELL=  COMP  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  DISK  AVOID  “Loading a Secondary Command Processor” in Chapter 10  You can use COMP to compare two sets of disk files of the same name and length. The FC command, which is discussed later in this command reference, provides many of the same capabilities as COMP. COMP is included on the DOS 6 Supplemental Disk, not in the standard DOS 6.0 package.  1.0 to 5.0—External   COMP  1.0 to 5.0—External  637  Syntax  COMP pathname1  pathname2   D   A   L   N=x  C  Parameters and Switches  pathname1  pathname2   D   A   L   C   N=x  Notes  Indicates the drive, path, and filename for the primary set of files. Wildcards are allowed. If no filename is specified, all files  *.*  are assumed.  Indicates the drive, path, and filename for the secondary set of files. Wildcards are allowed. If no filename is specified, all files  *.*  are assumed.  Displays differences in hexadecimal format.  Displays differences as alphanumeric characters.  Displays the line number in which the difference occurred.  Compares the first x number of lines of a file.  Performs a non–case-sensitive comparison of files.  1. If you do not enter a filename, all files for that set, whether primary or secondary, are  compared  which is the same as typing *.* . However, only the files in the secondary set with names that match filenames in the primary set are compared.  2. If you do not enter a drive, path, or filename, COMP prompts you for the primary and  secondary file sets to compare. Otherwise, the correct disks must be in the correct drive if you are comparing files on disks. COMP does not wait for you to insert disks if you use both primary and secondary filenames.  3. After 10 mismatches  unequal comparisons  between the contents of two compared  files, COMP ends the comparison and aborts.  4. A more versatile utility for file comparison is FC, discussed later in this command refer-  ence. COMP no longer is distributed with the standard DOS package.  Messages  Compare error at offset xxxxxxxx  Information: The files that you are comparing are not the same. The difference occurs at xxxxxxxx bytes from the start of the file. The number provided is in hexadecimal format, base 16. The values of the differing bytes in the files also are displayed in hexadecimal  format. Files are different sizes  App F   638  Appendix F  Command Reference  Warning: You asked COMP to compare two files of different lengths. Because COMP compares only files of the same size, COMP skips the comparison. 10 Mismatches - ending compare  Warning: COMP found 10 mismatches between the two files you compared. COMP, therefore, assumes that no reason exists to continue, and the comparison is aborted.  See Also  FC  CONFIG  Syntax  CONFIG re-creates the STACKER.INI file.

COPY  1.0 and later—Internal  639  You can use the COPY command to copy files between disk drives or between drives and devices. COPY enables you to keep or change the filenames and also enables you to combine  concatenate  files.  1.0 and later—Internal  COPY  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  Syntax  The syntax used to copy files from one place to another is very simple: COPY source destination   V   Y   Y-  You can tell DOS what kinds of files you are copying by using the  A  ASCII  and  B  BINARY  parameters: COPY   A   B source  A   B destination   A   B   V   Y   Y-  By adding plus signs, you can specify more than one source file and have them all combined  concatenated  into one destination file: COPY  A   B source  A   B +source2  A   B +...  A   B destination  A   B   V   Y   Y-  Parameters and Switches  source  Specifies the file or files that you want to copy. A full pathname  for example, drive:\path\ ... \filename.ext  can be specified, and wildcards are allowed. This parameter is required and must include a filename  *.* is not assumed . To combine files, specify more than one source pathname and separate them with plus  signs  + .  Specifies the location and optionally the filename you want to copy to. A full pathname can be specified, although normally only a drive and or path is included. Wildcards are allowed when a file- name is specified. If this parameter is omitted, the current drive and subdirectory are used as the destination.  Verifies that the copy was recorded correctly. Similar to setting VERIFY ON for this COPY operation.  Specifies that you want COPY to overwrite files without prompting you for confirmation. Including this parameter overrides any set- ting specified with the COPYCMD environment variable.  Specifies that you want COPY to prompt you for confirmation before overwriting any files, even if the command is run from with- in a batch file. Including this parameter overrides any setting speci- fied with the COPYCMD environment variable.  App F  destination   V   Y   -Y  The  A and  B switches create different effects on the source and destination files. Normally, you don’t have to specify these switches because DOS’s default assumptions are correct.   640  Appendix F  Command Reference  For the source file:   A   B   A   B  Rules  For the destination file:  Treats the file as an ASCII  text  file. The command copies all the information in the file up to, but not including, the end-of-file marker  Ctrl+Z . Data after the end-of-file marker is ignored. This is the default for copy operations that combine multiple files.  Copies the entire file  based on size, as listed in the directory  as though the file were a program file  binary1 . All end-of-file mark- ers  Ctrl+Z  are treated as normal characters, and EOF characters are copied. This is the default for copy operations that do not combine multiple files.  Adds an end-of-file marker  Ctrl+Z  to the end of the ASCII text file at the conclusion of the copying process. This is the default for copy operations that combine multiple files.  Does not add the end-of-file marker to this binary file. This is the default for copy operations that do not combine multiple files.  Adhere to the following rules when you are copying files for which both the source and the destination are given:  1. These rules apply to the filename:    You must provide either a pathname or a filename. Wildcards are allowed in the source filename. If you do not provide a filename but provide a pathname for the source, DOS assumes *.*.    If you do not provide a destination filename, the copied file has the same name,  creation date, and creation time as the source file.  2. You can substitute a device name for the complete source or destination name. 3. When you copy between disk drives, COPY assumes that binary files are copied  as  though you used the  B switch .  4. When you copy to or from a device other than a disk drive, COPY assumes that ASCII  files are copied  as though you used the  A switch .  5. An  A or  B switch overrides the default settings for COPY.  Adhere to the following rules when you are copying files and only one file is specified:  1. The file specification you use  d1:path1\filename1.ext1  is the source. This specifica-  tion must have one or both of these items:   COPY  1.0 and later—Internal  641    A valid filename. Wildcards are allowed.   A drive name, pathname, or both. If you provide only one name, that name must  differ from the current drive name or pathname. If you provide both names, at least one name must differ from the current drive name or pathname.  2. The source cannot be a device name. 3. The destination is the current drive and current directory. 4. The copied files use the same names as the source files. 5. COPY assumes that binary files are copied  as though you used the  B switch .  Adhere to these rules when you concatenate files:  1. The destination file is the last file in the list unless you add a plus sign  +  before that filename. If you do not specify a destination filename, the first source name becomes the destination name.  2. If you do not provide a drive name, DOS uses the current drive. 3. If you do not provide a path, DOS uses the current directory. 4. These rules apply to source files:    You must provide a valid filename. Wildcards are allowed, but using them can be dangerous. If you do not provide a destination filename, DOS uses the first file- name as the destination filename.    After the first filename, any additional source file specifications must be preceded  by a plus sign  + .  5. These rules apply to the destination file:    You can use only one destination file specification. If you provide a destination without wildcards, DOS uses that name for the destination file. If you provide a destination filename with wildcards, DOS uses the first source filename for the destination file.    If you do not provide a destination, DOS uses the first source file as the destina- tion. The first file that matches the wildcard filename is used as the destination file if you used a wildcard as part of the first source filename, and the files to be joined are appended to the first source file.  App F  Notes  1. The COPY command, when run from the command line, now prompts you for confirma-  tion before overwriting files. However, to avoid forcing you to rewrite all your batch files, COPY does not prompt you before overwriting a file when it is run from a batch file. If you don’t like the way COPY now behaves, you can change it by defining an environ- ment variable named COPYCMD. Setting COPYCMD equal to  Y forces COPY to act as it has in all previous versions of DOS, never prompting for confirmation before overwriting a file. If you set COPYCMD equal to  -Y, COPY always prompts for confirmation—even when it is run from within a batch file.   642  Appendix F  Command Reference  2. The meanings of the  A and  B switches depend on their positions in the line. The  A or   B switch affects the file that immediately precedes the switch and all files that follow the switch until DOS encounters another  A or  B switch. When you use one of these switches before a filename, the switch affects all following files until DOS encounters another  A or  B switch that contradicts the earlier switch.  3. Use XCOPY to copy zero-length files and all of a directory’s files and subdirectories. 4. To change the time and date of a file to the current time and date, enter the following  command: COPY   B  filename.ext+,,  5. You can create a text file by copying what you type to a file. To do so, use the following  format: COPY CON filename.ext Everything you type is then copied to filename.ext until you press Ctrl+Z or F6.  Messages  Cannot do binary reads from a device  Error: If you specify a device name such as CON or COM1 as the source in a COPY command, you cannot include the  B switch. These devices operate in character mode only. Try the command again without specifying the  B switch. Content of destination lost before copy  Error: You may see this message when you are combining files with the COPY command. If the destination file has the same name as any of the source files  except the first  that you’ve specified, COPY overwrites that source file before it has a chance to read it. When this mes- sage appears, at least one of your source files has been overwritten, and the file is gone for good. Be very careful combining files with the COPY command, especially if you are using wildcards in the source or destination parameters. File cannot be copied onto itself  Error: COPY tried to copy a file onto itself. The destination file must have a different filename or be in a different subdirectory than the source file. Change the destination parameter you specified and try the COPY command again.

So that transitions from one set of conventions to another can be as painless for the user as possible, application programs are encouraged to use this country-specific infor- mation. You can use COUNTRY= only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  COUNTRY=country_code,code_page,path\filename  Parameters and Switches  country_code  code_ page  A three-digit number that indicates the country whose conventions you want to use. Typically, the number is the international long-distance tele- phone code for that country.  See Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS.”   The code page  character set  to use for the country that you are specify- ing. If no code page is specified, the default code page for that country is used. You can switch between the default and alternative code pages by using MODE or CHCP.  path\filename The full path and filename of the file that contains country-specific infor-  mation; it is usually COUNTRY.SYS. If no filename is specified, COUNTRY= looks for COUNTRY.SYS in the root directory of the startup drive.  Notes  1. COUNTRY= affects the following items:    Date and time formats, both for display and input. DOS commands that use the  country setting for date and time include DATE, TIME, RESTORE, DIR, PROMPT, and XCOPY.    The thousands separator and decimal character used in numbers. In the U.S.,  they are a comma and period, respectively  for example, 1,024.45 .    The location and symbol used for currency.   Upper- to lowercase conversions. For each character set  code page , a table of  case conversions is maintained by DOS.    Alphabetical sorting order for characters in the set. This allows accented charac-  ters to sort into their proper places.  Always include the full path to the COUNTRY.SYS file when you use the COUNTRY= com- mand. In this way, you can keep the COUNTRY.SYS file in a more logical place, such as in your C:\DOS directory  which is the place Setup puts it, anyway .  App F  2. The default country code is 001  United States , code page 437, for versions of   MS-DOS sold in the U.S.   644  Appendix F  Command Reference  3. Not all application programs are written to support the international features of DOS,  and many ignore the COUNTRY= settings.  4. The MS-DOS distribution disks include a special version of COUNTRY.SYS named   COUNTRY.ICE  COUNTRY.IC_ in its compressed form  that contains information supporting an Icelandic keyboard and character set. For details, see the README.TXT file distributed with DOS 6.  5. Microsoft has special versions of MS-DOS available for other languages and countries not listed in the country codes table, such as Arabic, Israel, Japan, Korea, the People’s Republic of China, and Taiwan.  6. It is often best to leave out the code page argument in the COUNTRY= line and let DOS  use the default code page. To do so, just type two commas before you enter the location and name of the COUNTRY.SYS file.  See the first example that follows.   Examples  To set the country to France, insert the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file: COUNTRY=033,,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS  Notice that two commas are used so that DOS selects the default code page, which in this case is code page 850. Later, you could change to code page 437 by using the CHCP com- mand.  The following line sets the country to the United States with code page 437 active: COUNTRY=001,437,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS  In the U.S., this example is almost the same as not using the COUNTRY= command at all, except that you now have the ability to switch to code page 850 if you want to.  See Also  MODE device CP, CHCP, NLSFUNC, and KEYB  Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS”  COUNTRY.SYS  see COUNTRY=   Despite the .SYS extension, COUNTRY.SYS is not a device driver. It is a file that contains coun- try information—such as code page symbol sets—used by the COUNTRY= command. A similar file, containing information needed for an Icelandic configuration, is located in the file COUNTRY.ICE on the MS-DOS 6 distribution disks.  For details on setting up an Icelandic configuration, see the README.TXT file distributed with DOS 6.   Do not attempt to load COUNTRY.SYS into memory by placing it in a DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. Your computer will lock up, and you will have to reboot from a floppy disk.

Typing a colon  :  after the device name is optional. If you don’t include a device in the  command line for CTTY, an Invalid device message is displayed.  3. CTTY does not affect any other form of redirected I O or piping. For example, the <   redirect input symbol , >  redirect output symbol , and   pipe-between-programs char- acter  work as usual.  4. The CTTY command is designed so that you can use a terminal or teleprinter—rather  than the normal keyboard and video display—for console input and output. This versa- tility has little effect on most PC users.  5. To return control to the standard console, type CTTY CON on the auxiliary console. If the auxiliary console isn’t working or you don’t have one connected to your computer, you must reboot to re-enable the standard console.  6. The CTTY command does not affect programs that input and output directly to hard-  ware. Most major software applications fall into this category, so the CTTY command is rarely useful with them.  7. COMMAND also can be used to change the device that DOS uses for standard input and  output.   8. Do not attempt to reconfigure Windows with the CTTY command. Windows can be  configured to use devices other than the keyboard and video display, but not with the CTTY command.  CVT.EXE  651  See Also  COMMAND  “The CTTY Command” in Chapter 13  DR-DOS  CURSOR.EXE  Syntax  CURSOR  Snn  C OFF  H  Parameters and Switches  CURSOR.EXE makes a large cursor that is easier to see on LCD screens. You can even change the blink rate.   Snn  Sets the cursor blink interval to nn 20th of a second, where nn can be from 1 to 20.   C  OFF   H  Ensures compatibility with some CGA screens.  Returns to using the built-in hardware cursor.  Displays abbreviated help.  CVT.EXE  Windows  9x  !DANGER  In Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98, CVT.EXE converts a drive from FAT16 format to FAT32. The minimum drive size to convert to FAT32 is 512MB.  Syntax  CVT driveletter:  cvt32  Parameters and Switches  driveletter  The letter of the drive to be converted.   cvt32  As a safety measure, this parameter must be included to convert a drive.  It helps prevent unintentional conversions.  Notes  When a drive has been converted to FAT32, Windows and DOS cannot convert it back. Some third-party utilities, such as PartitionMagic, can convert from FAT32 to FAT16. In DOS, the only way to do so is to reformat the drive, destroying all the data in the process.  App F   652  Appendix F  Command Reference  If you use this drive with other operating systems that are not FAT32-compatible, they can- not read the converted drive.  PC-DOS  DATAMON  DATAMON provides protection against accidental file deletion. You can choose from two options to track deleted files: Delete Tracker or Delete Sentry. Delete Tracker saves the name of each deleted file and a list of the cluster numbers it occupied in a hidden file called PCTRACKR.DEL. Delete Sentry saves each deleted file in a hidden directory called \SENTRY.  Syntax  DATAMON  load  low  u  s  sentry+  sentry-  tracker+  tracker-  ?  Parameters and Switches   load   low   u   s  Loads the Data Monitor program using the options in the DATAMON.INI file.  Loads the Data Monitor program into conventional memory even if upper memory is available.  Removes the Data Monitor program from the computer’s memory.  Indicates which tracking option is active in the Data Monitor program.   sentry+   sentry-  Activates the Delete Sentry option.  Deactivates the Delete Sentry option.   tracker+  Activates the Delete Tracker option.   tracker-  Deactivates the Delete Tracker option.   ?  Displays the abbreviated online help.  Notes  Either the Delete Sentry or Delete Tracker option can be used at a time. DATAMON has to be added with one of the options to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  To disable the option temporarily, use the following commands: datamon  sentry-  datamon  tracker-  DATAMON should be turned off before starting the Stacker compression program and before running Stacker uncompression.   DATE  1.0 and later—Internal  653  DATE  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  1.0 and later—Internal The DATE command can display and set the current date for your computer. Normally, DOS and your computer’s hardware keep the date set properly for you. If you don’t have an AUTOEXEC.BAT file, DOS prompts you to enter the current date each time your computer reboots.  Syntax  DATE mon-day-year  Parameters and Switches  mon-day-year  Notes  The current date in a format consistent with the COUNTRY= setting in your CONFIG.SYS file. mon can be any number from 1 to 12. day can be any number from 1 to 31. year can be any number from 80 to 99 or from 1980 to 2099. In the United States, legal delimiters are the hyphen, period, or slash    . If this parameter is omitted, the current date is displayed, and you are prompted to enter a new date.  1. The date entry and display correspond to the COUNTRY setting in your CONFIG.SYS file.  If you are unsure of what format to use for the date, enter the DATE command with no parameters. DOS displays the current date in an appropriate format, and you can use it as a guide when entering a new date at the prompt.  2. When you boot the computer, DOS issues the DATE and TIME commands to set the sys- tem clock. If you placed an AUTOEXEC.BAT file on the boot disk, DOS does not display  a prompt for the date or time. You can include the DATE or TIME commands in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to have these functions set when DOS boots.  3. Most computers contain a real-time clock running on a battery. The date should stay  set properly as you turn your computer on and off, but it’s a good idea to check the date occasionally.  4. When you create or update a file, DOS updates the directory using the current date in the computer. This date shows which copy is the latest revision of the file. Several DOS commands  such as XCOPY  can use the date in selecting files.  5. The day-of-year calendar uses the time-of-day clock. If you leave your system on overnight, the day advances by one at midnight. DOS makes appropriate calendar adjustments for leap years.  App F  See Also  COUNTRY= and TIME  “Changing the Date and Time” in Chapter 10   654  Appendix F  Command Reference  DBLSPACE  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  6.0 and later—External  DBLSPACE starts the full-screen interface to the DoubleSpace disk-compression utility. DoubleSpace automatically compresses information on hard disks or floppy disks and con- figures many aspects of the compression process. Compression enables you to put more pro- grams and information on a disk.  With switches and parameters, you can control each aspect of DoubleSpace from the DOS command line. The many combinations are covered in the sections that deal with specific DoubleSpace commands.  MS-DOS 6.2 brought a number of new features to DoubleSpace. DoubleSpace can now share the HMA with MS-DOS, thereby decreasing DoubleSpace’s size in memory from 43KB to 33KB  or 37KB if the new automount feature is enabled . A DoubleGuard feature verifies the integrity of your data before writing it to disk. Also added is the Uncompress command, which enables you to uncompress a DoubleSpace drive easily. Finally, removable disks can now be automounted, enabling you to work with compressed floppy and cartridge disks from Windows.  Syntax  DBLSPACE  Notes  1. The first time you use the DBLSPACE command, DoubleSpace Setup starts. The setup  program enables you to compress one or more hard disks and loads DBLSPACE.BIN into memory.  DBLSPACE.BIN is the device driver that provides access to compressed drives.  Subsequent uses of the DBLSPACE command start the full-screen interface. The full- screen interface and the DBLSPACE switches and parameters give you control of all DoubleSpace operations.  2. DoubleSpace creates a large hidden file, called a compressed volume file  CVF , on one of  your drives, called the host drive, and presents that drive as a new drive, called a com- pressed drive. For example, you might make a CVF on your drive D that results in a compressed drive E; you and your programs then can use the files on the compressed drive without taking any special action.  3. CVF names use the format DBLSPACE.xxx, where xxx is a number  such as 000 or 001 . 4. Normally, after you have started using DoubleSpace on your computer, it automatically loads into memory every time you start your computer. To start your computer without loading DoubleSpace into memory, press Ctrl+F5  Clean  or Ctrl+F8  Interactive  when the Starting MS-DOS... message appears on your screen. Because DBLSPACE.BIN will not be loaded, you may not be able to access any of your compressed drives. For more information, see Appendix D, “DOS and DOS Utility Programs’ Keyboard Commands.”   DBLSPACE AUTOMOUNT 6.2—External  655  See Also  “Understanding DoubleSpace” in Chapter 6  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  DBLSPACE AUTOMOUNT  6.2—External The DBLSPACE  AUTOMOUNT command enables or disables automatic mounting of removable drives such as floppy and cartridge disks. This command changes the automount settings saved in the DBLSPACE.INI file. The default setting is for DoubleSpace to automatically mount removable drives.  Automounting makes it possible for you to change compressed floppy and cartridge disks from Microsoft Windows. You cannot use the DBLSPACE  AUTOMOUNT command while Windows is running.  Syntax  DBLSPACE   AUTOMOUNT=drives  Parameters and Switches  The removable drives that you want DoubleSpace to automatically mount.  drives Enter each drive letter—without a colon—and with no spaces in between. You also can spec- ify 0 to disable automatic mounting or 1 to automatically mount all removable drives. The default setting is 1.  1. For the automount setting to take effect, you must restart your computer. 2. Specifying 0 decreases the size of DoubleSpace in memory by approximately 4KB. 3. The parameters you specify are written to the AUTOMOUNT= line of the DBLSPACE.INI file.  Notes  Examples  To enable automounting of only two floppy drives A and B, enter the following command: DBLSPACE   AUTOMOUNT=AB  To disable automounting of all removable drives  and save a little memory , enter the fol- lowing command: DBLSPACE   AUTOMOUNT=0  App F  See Also  “Understanding DoubleSpace” in Chapter 6   656  Appendix F  Command Reference  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  DBLSPACE CHKDSK  6.0 only—External DBLSPACE  CHKDSK checks the structure of a compressed drive.

Syntax  DBLSPACE   COMPRESS  drive:  NEWDRIVE=host:   RESERVE=size   F  or DBLSPACE   COM  drive:  NEW=host:   RES=size   F  Parameters and Switches   NEWDRIVE=host:  drive:  The uncompressed  host  drive that you want to compress.  The uncompressed  host  drive after compression. This parameter can be abbreviated to  NEW=host:. If you omit the  NEWDRIVE=host: parameter, DoubleSpace uses the next available drive letter. Enter DBLSPACE  LIST to see a list of drive assignments.   DBLSPACE CREATE 6.0 and later—External  657   RESERVE=size  [ic:C9] F  The amount of space  in megabytes  to be left uncompressed on the host drive. This parameter can be abbreviated to  RES=size. The default is 2MB for hard disks and 0 for floppy disks.  DoubleSpace doesn’t display the compression statistics screen when compression is complete but simply returns to the DOS command prompt. Use this switch when you are running DBLSPACE  COMPRESS from a batch file.  1. A drive must contain some free space before DoubleSpace can compress it. If you want  to compress your boot drive, for example, it must have at least 1.2MB of free space. Other hard disks and floppy disks must have at least 1.1MB of free space  650KB for DOS 6.0 .  2. DoubleSpace cannot compress 360KB floppy disks because they do not have enough  free space.  3. A compressed floppy disk must be mounted before you can use it.  For more informa-  tion, see the DBLSPACE  MOUNT command.   4. If you want to read a compressed floppy disk on another computer, that computer must  be running DoubleSpace as well.  5. Your system probably needs some uncompressed disk space because some files  such as  Windows permanent swap files  do not work properly if you store them on a com- pressed drive.  To compress drive D so that the compressed part is known as D and the uncompressed  host  part is known as E, and contains 3MB of uncompressed free space, use the following: DBLSPACE   COMPRESS  D:   NEWDRIVE=E:   RESERVE=3  Notes  Examples  See Also  DBLSPACE  CREATE, DBLSPACE  LIST, and DBLSPACE  MOUNT  “Understanding DoubleSpace” in Chapter 6  App F  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  DBLSPACE CREATE  6.0 and later—External DBLSPACE  CREATE creates a new compressed drive by using free space on an uncompressed drive. DBLSPACE  CREATE can be used only on nonremovable media, such as a hard drive.   658  Appendix F  Command Reference  Syntax  DBLSPACE   CREATE  drive:  NEWDRIVE=host:  RESERVE=size   SIZE=size  or DBLSPACE   CR  drive:  N=host:  RE=size  SI=size  Parameters and Switches  drive:  The uncompressed  host  drive that contains the free space from which the new compressed drive will be created.   NEWDRIVE=host:  The new compressed drive. The default is the next available drive let- ter. This parameter can be abbreviated to  N=host:.   RESERVE=size   SIZE=size  The amount of space  in megabytes  to be left uncompressed on the host drive. This parameter can be abbreviated to  RE=size. To make the compressed drive as large as possible, specify a size of 0. If you omit both the  RESERVE and  SIZE parameters, DoubleSpace reserves 1MB of uncompressed space on your disk. You cannot specify  RESERVE if you specify  SIZE.  The size  in megabytes  of the compressed volume file  CVF  that will be created on the host drive. This parameter can be abbreviated to  SI=size. Depending on how well your files compress, the CVF can hold approximately twice as much information as you specify for size. You cannot specify  SIZE if you specify  RESERVE.  Notes  1. The DBLSPACE  CREATE command creates a compressed volume file  CVF  with the  name DBLSPACE.001 on the drive specified with the drive: parameter. If this file already exists, the 002 extension is added, and then the 003 extension is added, and so on.  2. When you use the DBLSPACE  CREATE command, unlike the DBLSPACE  COMPRESS com-  mand, the letter with which you refer to the host drive does not change.  3. You can use the DBLSPACE  CREATE command to create additional CVF files on the host drive of a disk compressed with the DBLSPACE  COMPRESS command. However, after you have created a CVF on a disk drive with the DBLSPACE  CREATE command, you cannot use the DBLSPACE  COMPRESS command on that drive without first deleting the existing CVF files. DBLSPACE  COMPRESS reassigns the drive letter you will use when accessing the host drive; it cannot do so if the host drive contains compressed drives.  4. You cannot use DBLSPACE  CREATE on removable media such as floppy disk drives or car-  tridge hard drives. To compress a floppy disk or cartridge hard disk, use the DBLSPACE  COMPRESS command.  5. Microsoft recommends that you use DBLSPACE  CREATE rather than DBLSPACE  COMPRESS  to create a compressed drive on a RAM disk.   DBLSPACE DEFRAGMENT 6.0 and later—External  659  6. Your system probably needs some uncompressed disk space because some files  such as Windows permanent swap files  do not work properly when you store them on a com- pressed drive.  Examples  To create a compressed drive that has the next available drive letter as its name and uses all the available free space on the uncompressed drive D, use the following: DBLSPACE   CREATE  D:   RESERVE=0  To create a new compressed drive F that uses 20MB of free space on the uncompressed drive D, enter this command: DBLSPACE   CREATE  D:   NEWDRIVE=F:   SIZE=20  See Also  DBLSPACE  COMPRESS, DBLSPACE  LIST, and DBLSPACE  MOUNT  “Understanding DoubleSpace” in Chapter 6  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  DBLSPACE DEFRAGMENT  6.0 and later—External DBLSPACE  DEFRAGMENT defragments a compressed drive by moving all the drive’s free space to the end of the drive. This command enables you to get the maximum reduction in the size of the drive when you issue the DBLSPACE  SIZE command.  Syntax  DBLSPACE   DEFRAGMENT drive:  F  or DBLSPACE   DEF drive:  F  Parameters and Switches  drive:  Specifies the compressed drive that you want to defragment. The default is the current drive.   F  Specifies that you would like the DoubleSpace drive defragmented more fully.  App F  Notes  1. Unlike defragmenting an uncompressed hard disk, defragmenting a DoubleSpace disk does not improve the disk’s performance. Defragmenting only moves the free space to the end of the compressed drive so that DBLSPACE  SIZE can be most effective.  2. You cannot tell how badly fragmented a compressed drive is before you decide to  defragment it.   660  Appendix F  Command Reference  3. How long defragmenting takes depends on many factors, including the speed of your  computer, the size of your compressed drive, and the speed of your disk drive. The process can take a long time—perhaps several hours.  4. You can stop the defragmentation process at any time by pressing Esc. 5. To thoroughly defragment a compressed drive, perform the following steps. First, cor- rect any errors on the host and compressed drives by using the ScanDisk utility. Next, defragment the host drive by using the DEFRAG command. Then, defragment the com- pressed drive by using the DBLSPACE  DEFRAGMENT  F command. Finally, collect all the free space at the end of the compressed drive by entering the DBLSPACE  DEFRAGMENT command.  Don’t specify the  F switch.   See Also  CHKDSK and SCANDISK  “Understanding DoubleSpace” in Chapter 6  DBLSPACE DELETE  6.0 and later—External The DBLSPACE  DELETE command unmounts a compressed drive and deletes its compressed volume file  CVF  from the host drive. If you simply want to delete all the files on a com- pressed drive, use the DBLSPACE  FORMAT command.  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  !DANGER  DBLSPACE   DELETE  drive:  DBLSPACE   DEL  drive:  Parameters and Switches  Syntax  or  Notes  drive:  The compressed drive that you want to delete. Note that you should specify the compressed drive, not the host drive.  1. Deleting a compressed drive deletes all the files in that drive. 2. If you accidentally delete a compressed drive, you may be able to restore it by using UNDELETE because a compressed drive is a file on one of your uncompressed disks  its host drive . The files corresponding to compressed drives are hidden and have names in the format DBLSPACE.xxx, where xxx is a number such as 000 or 001. If you can undelete the associated file, you can remount it by entering DBLSPACE  MOUNT.  3. DoubleSpace does not allow you to delete a compressed drive C.

UNFORMAT cannot restore the files deleted with this command, so be careful when you use it. To delete the drive as well, use the DBLSPACE  DELETE command.   662  Appendix F  Command Reference  DBLSPACE  FORMAT is a dangerous command. Formatting a compressed drive is a quick operation, and after you have given DoubleSpace the go-ahead, you cannot turn back. You cannot use the UNFORMAT command to recover a formatted compressed drive. Make absolutely sure you don’t need anything on the drive before formatting it.

After you have resolved all the duplicate root directory filenames by renam- ing, moving, or deleting the files listed in DBLSPACE.LOG, you can try to uncompress the drive again.  4. After the last compressed drive in your system has been uncompressed, DoubleSpace  removes DBLSPACE.BIN from memory. Removing this file can free 40KB to 50KB  of memory in your system.

See Also  DBLSPACE  MOUNT  “Understanding DoubleSpace” in Chapter 6  DBLSPACE.SYS  device driver   6.0 and later— External  CONFIG  SYS  DEVICE =  To allow DoubleSpace to perform its compression magic, DOS loads the DBLSPACE.BIN file into memory early in the boot process. Initially, DBLSPACE.BIN is placed at the top of conven- tional memory. The DBLSPACE.SYS device driver enables you to move DBLSPACE.BIN to its final location in conventional or upper memory. Moving DBLSPACE.BIN to upper memory can save as much as 43KB of conventional memory for your DOS programs to use. To move DBLSPACE.BIN, DBLSPACE.SYS must be loaded in a DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  In MS-DOS 6.2, DoubleSpace can share the high memory area  HMA  with DOS, decreas- ing the size of DoubleSpace in upper or lower memory to 33KB or to 37KB if the auto- mounting feature is enabled.  Syntax  To relocate the DBLSPACE.BIN driver to the bottom of conventional memory, load the  DBLSPACE.SYS device driver by using the DEVICE= command as follows: DEVICE=drive:\path\DBLSPACE.SYS   MOVE  NOHMA  To relocate the DBLSPACE.BIN driver into upper memory, load the DBLSPACE.SYS device driver by using the DEVICEHIGH= command like this: DEVICEHIGH=drive:\path\DBLSPACE.SYS   MOVE  NOHMA  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  Specifies the full path to the DBLSPACE.SYS file on your system. Setup places the DBLSPACE.SYS file in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to DBLSPACE.SYS isn’t specified, DOS looks for the file in the root directory of the startup drive.  Makes DBLSPACE.SYS move the DBLSPACE.BIN driver in memory. This parameter is required.  Prevents DoubleSpace from locating a portion of itself in the HMA  with DOS.   MOVE   NOHMA   DBLSPACE.SYS  device driver  6.0 and later—External  669  Notes  1. When DBLSPACE.BIN is first loaded into memory, it locates itself at the top of conven-  tional memory. If you let DBLSPACE.BIN remain in that position, a device driver that requires access to this area in memory may overwrite it, crashing your computer. If you are using DoubleSpace, you should always use the DBLSPACE.SYS device driver to relo- cate DBLSPACE.BIN to a more permanent, safe location.  2. To relocate DBLSPACE.BIN to the bottom of conventional memory, load DBLSPACE.SYS by  using the DEVICE= command. To relocate DBLSPACE.BIN to upper memory, load  DBLSPACE.SYS by using the DEVICEHIGH= command. Note that you must specify the  MOVE parameter either way. If you do not load the DBLSPACE.SYS driver, DBLSPACE.BIN is moved to the bottom of conventional memory after all other CONFIG.SYS processing  is complete.  3. Moving DBLSPACE.BIN to upper memory by using DEVICEHIGH= frees approximately 43KB of conventional memory. If not enough room is available in upper memory,  DBLSPACE.BIN is moved to the bottom of conventional memory instead.  DOS 6.2 only  DoubleSpace can share the HMA with DOS, thereby decreasing the amount of upper or lower memory it requires to 33KB or to 37KB if the automounting feature is enabled. You can prevent DoubleSpace from loading into the HMA by using the  NOHMA parameter.  4.  5. If DOS and DoubleSpace are sharing space in the HMA and you are using a disk cache   for example, SMARTDrive , you might want to decrease the BUFFERS= setting to 10. With DoubleSpace in the HMA, there is room for about 10 buffers, so specifying more than this number may cause DOS to locate all its buffers in conventional memory instead.  6. MemMaker optimizes the placement of DBLSPACE.BIN in memory if it finds the   DBLSPACE.SYS driver being loaded in CONFIG.SYS. Specifying the  L and  S options  with DEVICEHIGH= causes DBLSPACE.SYS to move DBLSPACE.BIN to the specified region s . Therefore, to MemMaker, optimization for this device driver works just like any other. 7. Unlike most device drivers, DBLSPACE.SYS doesn’t remain in memory. After it has moved  DBLSPACE.BIN into upper or lower memory, it unloads itself. Therefore, you can install DBLSPACE.SYS more than once in your CONFIG.SYS file without wasting memory. DoubleSpace may insert more than one DEVICE=DBLSPACE.SYS statement in your  CONFIG.SYS file to avoid certain problems with network device drivers.  8. You should load DBLSPACE.SYS before loading INTERLNK.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS file. If you load INTERLNK.EXE first, you might not be able to access all the drives on the client computer. In general, INTERLNK.EXE should be the last block device driver loaded in CONFIG.SYS.  9. If DBLSPACE.BIN is relocated after certain network drivers are loaded in memory, your  system may begin rebooting when certain DBLSPACE commands are run. If this happens, make sure that the device line for DBLSPACE.SYS comes before all network drivers loaded from CONFIG.SYS.  App F   670  Appendix F  Command Reference  10. The placement of the DEVICE=DBLSPACE.SYS line in your CONFIG.SYS file may affect the drive letters used in your system. In general, to allow device drivers to allocate letters that follow the physical drives in the system, load them before the DBLSPACE.SYS driver. After DBLSPACE.BIN has been moved, it allocates extra drive letters for host drives. Any device drivers loaded after this are assigned drive letters that follow DoubleSpace’s drive letters.  Having drive letters change simply because you added a device driver to your CONFIG.SYS file can result in time-consuming chores. Batch files often have to be edited to reflect the new drive letters. All references to drives that have changed must be corrected in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Microsoft Windows is sensitive to drive let- ter changes, and some Windows applications will fail if they are suddenly located on a dif- ferent drive.  Before you add or rearrange DEVICE= lines in your CONFIG.SYS file, think through the changes you may be making to drive letter assignments. You often can accomplish what you need without changing drive letter assignments.  Examples  The following lines install a RAM disk and relocate the DBLSPACE.BIN driver in upper mem- ory if enough space is available: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS  1450  512  224   E  DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS   MOVE  Because the RAM drive was loaded before DBLSPACE.BIN was moved, RAMDRIVE.SYS allocates drive letters before DoubleSpace. In a typical system with one or two floppy drives and a hard disk  with a CVF , the RAM drive would be D, and DoubleSpace, which normally saves four letters for later use, would use I as the host drive for C.  In the next example, the order is reversed, and the DEVICE= command is used to relocate DBLSPACE.BIN to the bottom of conventional memory instead of upper memory: DEVICE=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS   MOVE  DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS  1450  512  224   E  This time, DoubleSpace uses H for the host drive, and the RAM drive will become drive I.

See Also ATTRIB  DEBUG  !DANGER  1.0 and later—External  App F  The DEBUG utility tests and edits programs. You can use DEBUG to view and change the state of your computer at the hardware level. Be very careful when using DEBUG because, with just a few keystrokes, you can wipe out your hard drive, destroy files, disable your mouse, lock up the keyboard, and cause all sorts of nasty problems. However, you can also learn a lot about your computer by poking around with DEBUG. This program is a programmer’s tool and is rarely used by anyone else.  Syntax  DEBUG pathname  parameters   672  Appendix F Command Reference  Parameters and Switches  pathname  parameters  The program file that you would like DEBUG to load into memory. If this parameter is omitted, DEBUG starts with no file loaded.  Any parameters that you want to pass to the program file you specified with the pathname parameter. You cannot specify parameters if you do not specify pathname. This parameter is useful only if you are loading program files that accept arguments on their command line.  Notes  1. The DEBUG utility enables you to load a program into memory and then edit, test, and  save the edited program back to the disk. You also can use DEBUG to create small assem- bly language programs.  2. Most people come in contact with DEBUG only when they are given explicit instructions  on patching a particular file. In most cases, this involves creating a text file and then redirecting the input to DEBUG. The SPATCH.BAT file on the DOS 6 distribution disks uses this technique to patch  change  the Windows SWAPFILE.EXE program.  3. Details on using the DEBUG program are beyond the scope of this book. If you want   to learn about using DEBUG, check the MS-DOS online help system or the DOS 6 Technical Reference manual.  Examples  To start DEBUG, simply enter the following: DEBUG  To start DEBUG and load PROGRAM.EXE from C:\UTILS for editing, enter this: DEBUG  C:\UTILS\PROGRAM.EXE  After you start the DEBUG program, it displays its prompt  the hyphen  and waits for you to enter commands. To quit DEBUG, enter the Q  quit  command.  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  DEFRAG  6.0 and later—External Files become fragmented because of the way MS-DOS stores them on the disk. If parts of a single file are scattered over the disk, your disk drive requires more time to find and load all the pieces into memory. DEFRAG rearranges the files on your disk so that each is located in a series of contiguous clusters. Rearranging the files this way makes file access more efficient.

If this parameter is omitted, DEFRAG assumes that you want to defragment the current drive.  Performs the full optimization method, which provides the best optimization but takes the most time. It defragments all your files, moves them to the front of the disk, and puts all the empty space at the end of the disk. You can- not specify the  U or  Q parameters with  F.   Undocumented  Performs the quick optimization method. This method moves all your files to the beginning of the disk and maximizes the amount of contiguous free space on the disk, but your files are still fragmented. You can- not specify the  F,  U, or  S parameters with  Q. This parameter is not docu- mented by Microsoft and may not be available in all versions.  Performs the unfragment-only optimization method. This method defrag- ments all your files but does not rearrange them on the disk. The empty space is left spread over the disk. You cannot specify the  F,  Q, or  S parame- ters with  U.   S:order  Controls the order of files in their directories. If you omit this switch, the current order of files on your disk is unchanged. The colon  :  is optional. Use any combination of the following values for order, without separating them with spaces:  N  N-  E  E-  D  D-  S  S-  Sorts in alphabetical order by name  A to Z   Sorts in reverse alphabetical order by name  Z to A   Sorts in alphabetical order by extension  A to Z   Sorts in reverse alphabetical order by extension  Z to A   Sorts by date and time  newest to oldest   Sorts by date and time  oldest to newest   Sorts by size  smallest to largest   Sorts by size  largest to smallest   Restarts  reboots  your computer after the files have been reorganized. Make sure you use this switch if you use the FASTOPEN utility.  Allows DEFRAG to move a file even if it has the hidden attribute set.  Normally, DEFRAG does not move files with hidden attributes.  Note that even when  H is specified, DEFRAG still does not move files with the system attribute.   SKIPHIGH  Normally, DEFRAG uses upper memory if it is available. Specifying the  SKIPHIGH switch forces DEFRAG not to use any upper memory.  App F   674  Appendix F Command Reference   LCD   BW   G0  Uses screen colors suited to a liquid crystal display.

By default, DEFRAG is loaded into upper memory if enough memory is free. 4. Do not use DEFRAG to optimize network drives or drives created with INTERLNK. 5. If you are using FASTOPEN when you defragment, specify DEFRAG  B so that out-of-date  buffers kept by FASTOPEN are not used after the defragmenting operation.  6. Do not run DEFRAG when any other program is running, including Microsoft Windows.  If you have any programs resident in memory that might try to access the disk being defragmented, you should disable or remove them from memory before running DEFRAG. An exception is the SMARTDRV disk cache.  You don’t have to remove it because DEFRAG disables it for you automatically.  If a program accesses a disk while it is being defragmented, data may be lost.  7. It is a good idea to run a utility such as CHKDSK or SCANDISK before running DEFRAG to  correct any logical errors on the drive before defragmenting its files.

DOS prompts you before deleting each file. This can make it easier to delete a group of files that are difficult to specify with wildcards.  1. If you provide a drive name, pathname, or both, and specify either *.* or no name for the filename, the DEL command prepares to delete all the files in the specified directory. Before it deletes them, DOS displays the following message: All files in directory will be deleted. Are you sure  Y N ? If you type Y, DOS erases all files in the specified directory  but not in the subdirecto- ries . If you type N, no files are erased.  2. If you specify the  P parameter, DEL prompts you before deleting each file by displaying  a line such as the following: MYFILE.TXT     Delete  Y N ? If you type Y, DOS erases the file. If you type N, the file is skipped.  3. You may be able to recover an erased file by using the special DOS 5.0 and 6.0  UNDELETE utility program. Use UNDELETE immediately after accidentally erasing a file.  4. The DOS RECOVER utility does not recover erased files.

Through the use of installable device drivers, DOS can be expanded to support many features and devices that aren’t supported in the DOS kernel.

Some device drivers use case-sensitive or position- sensitive parameters. See the instructions provided with the device driver for details.  filename  parameters  Notes  1. If MS-DOS cannot find the specified device driver file, it displays a Bad or missing filename message and continues processing CONFIG.SYS.  See the first message in the “Messages” section for the DEVICE= command.   2. Device drivers are often sensitive to the order in which they are loaded. DOS executes each DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= command in the order in which it appears in CONFIG.SYS.  3. The following device drivers are provided with MS-DOS:  ANSI.SYS CHKSTATE.SYS* DBLSPACE.SYS DISPLAY.SYS DRIVER.SYS EGA.SYS EMM386.EXE HIMEM.SYS INTERLNK.EXE POWER.EXE PRINTER.SYS** RAMDRIVE.SYS SETVER.EXE SMARTDRV.EXE SMARTDRV.SYS*** * CHKSTATE.SYS is used by MemMaker and shouldn’t be installed in your CONFIG.SYS file. ** PRINTER.SYS is not distributed with DOS 6 but is available on the supplemental disk.   DEVICE= 2.0 and later—Internal  681  *** SMARTDRV.SYS was replaced by SMARTDRV.EXE in MS-DOS version 6. All the device drivers in this list can be installed with the DEVICE= command.  DOS 6 includes two files with the SYS extension that are not device drivers: COUNTRY. SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS. If you attempt to load these files by using the DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= commands, your computer may lock up, forcing you to reboot. COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS are data files used by COUNTRY= and KEYB, respectively.  4. You cannot load normal executable files into memory by using the DEVICE= command. Entering CHKDSK.EXE or even DOSKEY.COM on a DEVICE= line generates an error message  see the first message in the “Messages” section  or lock up your computer. Device dri- vers are in a special format, and only files conforming to that format can be successfully loaded with the DEVICE= command. If an executable program can be loaded during the processing of the CONFIG.SYS file  not all can , it can be placed in memory by the INSTALL= command. External commands that load in a DEVICE= command line and run from the DOS prompt as well  such as EMM386, INTERLNK, POWER, and SETVER  are hybrid files that con- form to both formats. When loaded from a DEVICE= command in CONFIG.SYS, the device driver portion of the file is loaded into memory. Executing the same command from the DOS prompt runs the executable portion of the file, which typically sets operating parameters or displays the status of the device driver already in memory.  Examples  Normally, the following two DEVICE= lines appear in CONFIG.SYS somewhere near the begin- ning of the file: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE  RAM  MIN=0 DOS=HIGH,UMB  The DEVICE= lines load HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE into memory, and provide the services necessary for DOS to load into the HMA with the DOS=HIGH,UMB command. Note that the DEVICE= line for HIMEM.SYS must appear before the line for EMM386.EXE because EMM386 requires memory provided by HIMEM to operate.  App F  Messages  Bad or missing filename  Error in CONFIG.SYS line number  Warning: DOS displays this message if it can’t find the file you specified in the DEVICE=, DEVICEHIGH=, or INSTALL= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. filename is the name of the file that DOS was looking for, and number is the line in CONFIG.SYS where the command is locat- ed.

See Also  DEVICEHIGH= and INSTALL=  Chapter 19, “Configuring Your Computer”  DEVICEHIGH=  CONFIG  SYS  5.0 and later—Internal  With the DEVICEHIGH= command, DOS can load device drivers into upper memory space, saving conventional memory for your application programs. To do so, DOS must have a UMB provider, such as EMM386, available. Also, the driver must be small enough to fit into the available UMB space. If DOS cannot load a driver specified with the DEVICEHIGH= com- mand into upper memory, it loads the driver into conventional memory instead. Not all device drivers can run in upper memory. DEVICEHIGH= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Before you begin inserting DEVICEHIGH= commands in CONFIG.SYS, you should have a bootable floppy disk available. That way, you can always start DOS from a floppy disk if changes you make in CONFIG.SYS prevent DOS from booting. Alternatively, with DOS 6, you can press the F5  Clean boot  key to bypass CONFIG.SYS completely or F8  Interactive  to choose which lines in CONFIG.SYS to execute when problems arise.  Syntax  In its simplest form, which follows, the DEVICEHIGH= command works just like the DEVICE= command: DEVICEHIGH=drive:\path\filename parameters   DOS 6 only  DEVICEHIGH= has two additional switches that MemMaker uses to specify the placement and size of the device driver in memory: DEVICE  L:region,min;region,min;...

You can speci- fy more than one region by separating each region from the previous one with a semicolon. For instance,  L:1;2 gives the driver access to UMB regions 1 and 2.  L:1,4096;2,512 further specifies that the minimum size of regions 1 and 2 should be 4,096 bytes and 512 bytes, respectively. This parameter must precede the device driver filename. MemMaker sets these values for you.   DOS 6 only  If the  L parameter is specified with a minimum size,  S instructs DOS to shrink the UMB to the specified size and create a new UMB from the remainder.  S must precede the device driver filename. This switch is best left to MemMaker’s use.   DOS 5  The minimum size block, in hexadecimal notation, into which DOS should attempt to load the driver.  MEM  D can provide the hexadec- imal value needed for this syntax.  This parameter must precede the device driver filename.  Notes  1. Before using the DEVICEHIGH= command, you must install a UMB provider and then execute a DOS=UMB command. Typically, this means that you must load HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE with UMB support enabled and then specify DOS=UMB  or DOS=HIGH,UMB  before using the DEVICEHIGH= command.  App F  You must install a UMB provider and add the DOS=UMB command before using the DEVICEHIGH= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. That way, you can always start DOS from a floppy disk if changes you make in CONFIG.SYS prevent DOS from booting. Alternatively, with DOS 6, you can press the F5  Clean  and F8  Interactive  boot keys to bypass completely or choose which lines in CONFIG.SYS to execute when problems arise.   684  Appendix F Command Reference  If you use other memory managers, such as 386MAX, BLUEMAX, QEMM, or CEMM, use their versions of DEVICEHIGH= and LOADHIGH may be better than using the ones DOS pro- vides. Sometimes, simply specifying DOS=UMB is a mistake. Follow the instructions and  recommendations that came with the product you purchased.  2. If DOS is unable to load the device driver into upper memory, it loads the driver into conventional memory instead. No error messages are displayed when this happens. To see what device drivers have been loaded into upper memory, use the MEM  C command.  3. If MS-DOS cannot find the specified device driver file, it displays a Bad or missing filename message and continues processing CONFIG.SYS.  See the first message in the DEVICEHIGH= command’s “Messages” section.   4. Device drivers are often sensitive to the order in which they are loaded. DOS executes each DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= command in the order in which it appears in CONFIG.SYS.  5. The following device drivers provided with MS-DOS can be loaded into UMB space  with the DEVICEHIGH= command:  ANSI.SYS DBLSPACE.SYS DISPLAY.SYS DRIVER.SYS EGA.SYS PRINTER.SYS* RAMDRIVE.SYS SETVER.EXE *PRINTER.SYS is not distributed with DOS 6 but is available on the supplemental disk. INTERLNK.EXE, POWER.EXE, and SMARTDRV.EXE all use UMB space automatically if it is available, so you don’t need to load them with a DEVICEHIGH= command. CHKSTATE.SYS is best left for MemMaker to handle. HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE minimize their use of conventional memory when they load.  DOS 6 includes two files with the .SYS extension that are not device drivers: COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS. If you attempt to load these files with the DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= command, your computer may lock up, forcing you to reboot. COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS are data files used by COUNTRY= and KEYB, respectively.  6. MemMaker can optimize your CONFIG.SYS file for you, inserting DEVICEHIGH= and   LOADHIGH commands as needed to load as many device drivers and resident programs into upper memory space as possible. MemMaker also takes care of specifying the cor- rect parameters for EMM386.EXE, ensuring that you have the maximum amount of UMB space available. This can be a big timesaver.  7. Before you start optimizing memory in your system, look at the resident software  you’re loading to see whether you need it all. For instance, the setup program for DOS   DEVICEHIGH= 5.0 and later—Internal  685  6 installs SETVER.EXE whether or not you use any software that needs to be fooled into working with DOS 6. The cardinal rule is Less is More. Fewer drivers and TSRs mean fewer complicated interactions and fewer problems with load orders and “RAM cram.” Look for the balance of features and free memory that enables you to use your system efficiently. Trim your system to the essentials and then let MemMaker optimize it.  8. By default, DOS loads a driver into the largest free UMB and makes the other UMBs available to that driver. The  L switch can be used to fine-tune your configuration by forcing small drivers to be loaded into small UMBs. However, loading a driver with the  L switch gives the driver access to only the UMB specified. Therefore, if the driver requires more than one UMB, you must specify multiple regions by using the  L switch  for example,  L:1;2 . To see how a driver uses memory and get a better idea of what values to use with the  L switch, use the MEM  M driver_name command.  9. MEM can be an enormous help when you’re trying to understand memory usage in your  computer. If you redirect the output of MEM to a file with the line  C  >  MEM_USE.TXT and then load that file into EDIT, you can page back and forth through MEM’s report. With the information MEM supplies, you can easily see how your computer’s memory  has been divided and which drivers and TSRs are responsible for your “RAM cram” problems.  10. DOS doesn’t load a driver in a UMB if the UMB is smaller than the driver’s load size.  Usually, the device driver’s file size is equal to its load size.  If the driver requires more memory to run, you must specify one or more min parameters, which are the sizes of the UMBs that the driver requires when it runs. This procedure forces DOS to load the driver into a larger than normal UMB. Specify min in bytes after the corresponding region parameter, with a comma between  for example,  L:1,4096;2,512 .  DR-DOS  11. In DR DOS, HIDEVICE is an alternative command that functions the same as  DEVICEHIGH.  Examples  Before you can use the DEVICEHIGH= command to load device drivers into upper memory, UMB space must be available to DOS. The following lines set the stage for using  DEVICEHIGH= on a typical 80386 or 80486 computer system: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE  RAM DOS=HIGH,UMB  App F  First, the DEVICE= lines load HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE into memory. These drivers provide the services necessary for the DOS=HIGH,UMB command, which comes next. Without these three lines at the beginning of your CONFIG.SYS file, the DEVICEHIGH= and LOADHIGH com- mands cannot access upper memory, so they use conventional memory instead. Note that the DEVICE= line for HIMEM.SYS must come before the line for EMM386.EXE because EMM386 requires memory provided by HIMEM. Neither of these device drivers can be loaded with the   686  Appendix F Command Reference  DEVICEHIGH= command, but both drivers do attempt to minimize their impact on conven- tional memory when they load.  Now that everything is ready, use the DEVICEHIGH= command to load device drivers into upper memory just as you would use the DEVICE= command to load them into conventional memory. For instance, the following lines load the ANSI.SYS and SETVER.EXE device drivers into UMBs: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS  DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE  When MemMaker optimizes your CONFIG.SYS file for you, the DEVICEHIGH= command lines start looking more complicated with the inclusion of the  L and  S switches: DEVICEHIGH   L:1,4096   S=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS  DEVICEHIGH   L:1,1024   S=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE  At this point, if you want DOS to prompt you before loading ANSI.SYS and SETVER.EXE, add question marks directly after DEVICEHIGH on each command line: DEVICEHIGH?   L:1,4096   S=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS  DEVICEHIGH?   L:1,1024   S=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE  Note that making these drivers optional defeats the purpose of optimizing their placement in memory, but it does clearly show that the question mark must be placed directly after the command name, not with the equal sign.

DIR  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  1.0 and later—Internal The DIR command displays information about files on your disks. It is one of the most com- monly used DOS commands.

This parameter cannot be combined with the  C parameter.   CH  Notes  1. DIR now displays numbers with embedded commas, making them much easier to read. 2. By default, the list displayed by the DIR command includes the following information:  Volume label and serial number One directory or filename per line File size  in bytes  Date and time of the last modification Number of files listed Total bytes listed Number of available bytes remaining on the disk  3. When more than one sortorder value is specified, the filenames are sorted from the left  value to the right value.  4. You cannot use the DIR command for a drive in which you used the ASSIGN or JOIN  command. You must break the assignment before you view the directory for a drive in which you used ASSIGN. You cannot use the DIR command on the guest disk drive involved in a JOIN command.  5. DIR does not report statistics for disk drives in which you used the ASSIGN or JOIN com-  mand. For disk drives in which you used JOIN, DIR reports the free space of the host disk drive  the disk drive to which the second disk drive is joined  but does not report the total of the two disk drives. You can remove ASSIGN or JOIN from the drive to find its amount of free space.  6. In DOS 5.0 or 6.0, you can use SET DIRCMD to set DIR switches in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Do not use DISKCOMP for a network drive or a drive in which you used the ASSIGN, JOIN,  or SUBST command.  5. Two disks containing the same files do not compare the same with DISKCOMP if the  information in the files is arranged differently. For that reason, DISKCOMP is useful only when you’re comparing floppy disks that were duplicated with the DISKCOPY command.

If drive x is the disk that holds the desti- nation  copied  disk, the copy probably is bad.  The disk has a hard, or unrecoverable, read error.  If drive x holds the original disk, a flaw existed when the disk was formatted, or a flaw developed during use.  Run CHKDSK on the original disk and look for the line bytes in bad sectors. Even if this line is displayed, the original disk and copy may be good.  The bad sectors may not be used by any of the files on the disk.  When you format a disk, FORMAT detects bad sectors and “hides” them. DISKCOMP, however, does not check for bad sectors; it tries to compare the tracks, even if bad sectors exist. For safety’s sake, retire the original disk soon. Invalid drive specification Specified drive does not exist or is non-removable  Error: One  or both  of the specified drives does not exist or is a hard disk. This error can result if you specify only one drive to DISKCOMP and the current drive is a hard disk.

DISKCOPY now uses the directory that the TEMP environment variable points to if it runs  out of memory while reading the source disk. Therefore, if you make single drive copies  for example, DISKCOPY A: A: , you no longer have to swap disks two or three times to make those copies. As long as your hard drive has enough space, DISKCOPY reads the entire source disk before asking for the destination disk.  2. The source and destination disk drives must be floppy disk drives—not hard or net- worked disk drives, RAM disks, or disk drives in which you used the JOIN or SUBST command. Defaulting to or specifying a nonreal source or destination disk drive causes DOS to return an error message and abort the copy operation.   DISKCOPY  1.0 and later—External  693  3. If you do not provide a source disk drive name, DISKCOPY uses the default disk drive. If  you provide an improper source disk drive, DISKCOPY issues an error message and aborts. 4. If your system has a single floppy disk drive and you provide only one valid floppy disk  drive name, DOS uses that drive as both the source and destination disk drive for the copy. If your system uses two floppy disk drives and you provide only one valid disk drive name, DOS displays the Invalid drive specification error message.  5. DISKCOPY destroys any information recorded on the destination disk. Do not use as the  destination disk one that contains information you want to keep. 6. To ensure that the copy is correct, run DISKCOMP on the two disks. 7. DISKCOPY ignores the effects of an ASSIGN command. 8. DISKCOPY recognizes unformatted destination disks and automatically formats them as  part of the copying process.  9. Write-protecting the source disk is important when you use only one floppy disk drive to make a copy of a disk. DOS periodically prompts you to change the disk. You cannot damage a write-protected source disk if you inadvertently insert that disk when DOS asks for the destination disk.  10. When you use DISKCOPY, DOS reads into memory as much information as possible from the source disk. DOS then copies this information to the destination disk and reads the next batch of information from the source disk. The more free memory is available, the less time you need to copy a disk.  11. DISKCOPY copies whatever level of file fragmentation is on the source disk to the destina-  tion disk. To avert this problem, you might want to run DEFRAG on the source disk before copying it or use FORMAT on the destination disk and then use XCOPY to copy files to it.  Messages  Drive types or diskette types not compatible  Error: The drive types or disk capacities that you tried to use are different and cannot han- dle the operation, or the destination disk is the wrong capacity.

Setup places the DISPLAY.SYS file in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to DISPLAY.SYS isn’t specified, DOS looks for the file in the root directory of the startup drive.  Specifies that the CON device is being described. The colon is optional, but the parameter itself is required.  Indicates the type of display being used. It must be one of the type codes from the following display type table. This parameter must be enclosed in parentheses.  Display Type Color Graphics Adapter Monochrome Display Adapter EGA, VGA, or Super VGA IBM PC Convertible LCD  type  CGA  MONO  EGA  LCD  num_cp 0 0 0 to 6 0 to 1  subfonts 0 0 2 1  Note that although CGA and MONO display types are allowed, neither of these displays supports code page switching. Loading DISPLAY.SYS for a CGA or MDA display is a waste of memory.  Specifies the hardware code page built into the display, normally 437 in the United States. As long as you specify this parameter, you can always switch back to the default hardware code page built into your display adapter. See Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS,” for a list of the code pages that MS-DOS supports.  Specifies the number of software code pages to allow space for in mem- ory. Valid values for num_cp are shown in the previous display type table.  If this parameter is omitted, a default value of 1 is used. Specifying 0 reserves no memory for display code pages, which effectively disables code page switching.  Indicates the number of subfonts that your display hardware supports for each code page. The default values for this parameter are shown in the previous display type table. If subfonts is specified, it and the num_cp parameter must be enclosed in a second set of parentheses.   DISPLAY.SYS  device driver   3.3 and later—External  697  Notes  1. Load the DISPLAY.SYS driver after any other device drivers that affect the DOS console  device. For instance, you should load DISPLAY.SYS after you load ANSI.SYS in your  CONFIG.SYS file. Otherwise, the other console driver is likely to disable DISPLAY.SYS.  2. When DISPLAY.SYS is loaded, it reserves memory for itself and for num_cp code pages. DISPLAY.SYS itself uses about 5KB of memory, the first code page adds 13KB, and each additional code page requires about another 10KB. In total, DISPLAY.SYS needs 18KB of RAM for one code page, 28KB of RAM for two code pages, and so on.  3. If you do not specify the hardware code page that the display supports, you cannot  switch back to it after you activate an alternative software code page. For this reason, you should always specify a value for hard_cp.  4. Although you are allowed to specify num_cp equal to zero, doing so defeats the purpose of loading DISPLAY.SYS. With no additional code pages in memory, you can’t switch to a different one, which is the only reason for using DISPLAY.SYS in the first place. CGA and MDA displays do not support code page switching, so the maximum num_cp you can specify for these displays is zero, which once again is a pointless configuration.  5. To display a software code page, you need to perform a number of additional steps. You use the MODE command to prepare and load the code page information into the memory set aside by DISPLAY.SYS. Then, you can use MODE to select the display code page, or you can load NLSFUNC and use the CHCP command to change the active code page for all your devices at once. Additionally, you might want to add the COUNTRY= command to your CONFIG.SYS file to make case conversion and sort order information available.  6. The KEYB utility provides code page support for the input side of the DOS console  device. By using KEYB, you can remap your keyboard to conform with various interna- tional conventions.  7. PRINTER.SYS performs a similar function for certain IBM printers that support code  page switching. It is available on the DOS 6 Supplemental disk.  Examples  The following line enables an EGA or a VGA display, which uses hardware code page 437, to load and switch to an alternative code page: DEVICE=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS  CON:= EGA,437,1   If you want to load DISPLAY.SYS into upper memory with room for two code pages, use the following line: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS  CON= EGA,437,2   Notice that you can use the CON= or the CON:= format. Two subfonts are available in both of these examples because a display type of EGA defaults to two subfonts.  App F   698  Appendix F Command Reference  If you have an IBM Convertible LCD display that uses hardware code page 865  Nordic  and you want to enable code page switching on it, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS  CON= LCD,865,1   Only one subfont is available because that is the default  and maximum  for LCD displays.  See Also  CHCP, COUNTRY=, MODE device CP, NLSFUNC, and PRINTER.SYS  Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS”  DOS=  CONFIG  SYS  5.0 and later—Internal  The DOS= command offers two options that enable you to adjust the way DOS loads and uses upper memory. If you specify DOS=HIGH, DOS attempts to load itself into the high memory area  HMA . The DOS=UMB command enables DOS to load resident programs into upper memory blocks  UMBs  with the DEVICEHIGH= and LOADHIGH commands. DOS= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  DOS=high_low,umb_noumb  Parameters and Switches  high_low  Specifies whether DOS should attempt to load itself in the high memory area  DOS=HIGH  or in conventional memory  DOS=LOW . To load HIGH, DOS requires an extended memory  XMS  manager such as HIMEM.SYS. The default value  is LOW.  umb_noumb  Specifies whether DOS should manage upper memory blocks created by a UMB provider such as EMM386.EXE  DOS=UMB  or not  DOS=NOUMB . The default value is NOUMB.  Notes  1. If you include a DOS= command in your CONFIG.SYS file, you must include at least one parameter with it. To include more than one parameter, separate them with commas  for example, DOS=HIGH,UMB .  Always specify DOS=HIGH in CONFIG.SYS if your computer supports it. Few programs use the HMA, and loading DOS high can easily free 45KB to 55KB of conventional memory. This is a rare opportunity to get something valuable without losing anything.   DOS=  5.0 and later—Internal  699  2. Although you can enter more than one DOS= line in your CONFIG.SYS file, it’s better not  to do so. In general, if the combination of parameters specified with more than one DOS= line would be legal on the first DOS= line in the file, you are okay. Sometimes you can specify DOS=UMB after using the DEVICEHIGH= command, but you should avoid doing so when possible. All the load order interactions are too confusing and aren’t guaran- teed to remain the same from one version of DOS to the next. Use one DOS= line, locat- ed directly after the line that loads your memory manager software.  3. You must load HIMEM.SYS  or another extended memory manager  before specifying  DOS=HIGH in your CONFIG.SYS file. DOS loads itself into the HMA after all other CON- FIG.SYS processing is complete. If the HMA is unavailable or in use at that time, DOS displays an error message  see the first message in the “Messages” section  and loads itself into conventional memory. The HMA is not available on 8088 and 8086 proces- sors, but is available on 80286 computers with A20 line support and at least 1MB  of RAM.  4. To allow DOS to load resident programs into upper memory blocks, you must load a UMB provider  such as EMM386.EXE  and specify DOS=UMB in your CONFIG.SYS file. No error message is displayed if DOS is unable to access the upper memory blocks.  Examples  A typical entry for DOS= in your CONFIG.SYS file follows: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE  RAM DOS=HIGH,UMB  This entry loads DOS into the HMA and enables the use of the LOADHIGH and DEVICEHIGH= commands. Note that HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE must be loaded before the DOS=HIGH,UMB command. The following series of commands uses an alternative syntax to do the same thing: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE  RAM DOS=HIGH DOS=UMB  Because you can split the DOS=HIGH and DOS=UMB commands, you may be tempted to add other commands between them. The following series of commands is legal, but you should avoid chaotic arrangements like this in your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DOS=HIGH FILES=50 BUFFERS=20 DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE  RAM LASTDRIVE=Z SWITCHES= W DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS DOS=UMB  App F   700  Appendix F Command Reference  The use of DEVICEHIGH= before the DOS=UMB command is misleading. Also, if a future version of DOS executes the UMB portion of the DOS= command with the first DOS=HIGH line, UMB support may not be present yet, and the command could fail without displaying an error message. Although this particular series of commands seems to work, other arrangements and commands may cause problems. Because you gain nothing from this type of arrange- ment, avoid it. Use one DOS= line in your CONFIG.SYS file, located directly after the lines that load HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, and insert blank lines to make logical groups of commands stand out, as shown here: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE  RAM DOS=HIGH,UMB  BUFFERS=20 FILES=50 LASTDRIVE=Z SWITCHES= W  DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS  You probably will agree that this example is much easier to read and understand than the one before it.  Messages  HMA not available: Loading DOS low  Warning: You specified DOS=HIGH, but DOS was unable to load into the HMA. Typically, it cannot load into this area because the DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS line in your CONFIG.SYS file is not present or is after the DOS=HIGH line. Less likely causes are that the HMA is already in use or that HIMEM was unable to gain control of the A20 line.  See Also  DEVICEHIGH=, EMM386.EXE, HIMEM.SYS, and LH  or LOADHIGH   Chapter 19, “Configuring Your Computer”  DOSBOOK starts the full-screen help utility and online documentation for DR DOS. Normally, you would just enter DOSBOOK at the command line and choose from topics in the menu sys- tem. However, you can jump directly to topics using the following syntax.

Syntax  DOSDATA=umbnoumb  Parameters and Switches  umbnoumb  Specifies whether the system tables are loaded into upper memory or conven- tional memory. The umb parameter loads the system tables  FILES, FCBS, BUFFERS, LASTDRIVE, STACKS  into upper memory if available. The noumb para- meter loads the system tables into conventional memory. The default setting is noumb.  PC-DOS  DOSDOCK  DOSDOCK enables mobile computer users to use hot or warm docking. The command speci- fied must be any DOS executable format  for example, .EXE, .COM, or .BAT files .  DOSDOCK loads and remains resident waiting for a DOCK or UNDOCK event. You can set the DOCK or UNDOCK environment variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file by using the SET command. DOSDOCK can run the SET DOCK= or SET UNDOCK= command only when no other applications, including Windows, are running.  Syntax  DOSDOCK  ?  Parameters and Switches   ?  Displays the abbreviated online help.  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  DOSKEY  5.0 and later—External DOSKEY enhances the usability of the DOS command line. It adds standard editing capabili- ties and the capability to recall recently used command lines. It also has fairly extensive macro capabilities, with which you can create command aliases or fast batch files. When DOSKEY is first run, it loads itself into memory and remains there until you reboot your com- puter.  App F  Syntax  DOSKEY   REINSTALL   BUFSIZE=size  MACROS   HISTORY   INSERT   OVERSTRIKE macroname=text ...  or DOSKEY  REINSTALL   BUFSIZE=size  M   H   INSERT   OVERSTRIKE macroname=text ...   702  Appendix F Command Reference  Parameters and Switches   REINSTALL  Installs a new copy of DOSKEY even if a copy already is installed. This is the only way to resize the DOSKEY buffer without restarting your computer, but the memory used by the previous copy of DOSKEY will be wasted. This clears the DOSKEY buffer.  Indicates the size of the buffer, in bytes, that DOSKEY uses to store macros and command lines. The default is 512, and the minimum is 256. Increasing or decreasing the buffer size affects how much memory DOSKEY requires when loaded.  Displays a list of the DOSKEY macros you have defined. You can redirect output by using the redirection symbol, >. This switch can be abbreviated as  M.  Displays a list of all commands currently stored by DOSKEY. You can redi- rect output by using the redirection symbol, >. This switch can be abbrevi- ated as  H.  Inserts new text into the command line  insert mode on . The default is  OVERSTRIKE. Pressing the Insert key toggles between insert and overstrike modes.  Makes new text overwrite old text on the command line  overstrike mode on . This is the default setting. Pressing the Insert key toggles between insert and overstrike modes.  Specifies the commands that you want DOS to execute when you type macroname at a DOS command prompt. If text is null, the definition of macroname is deleted.  Indicates that you can enter as many macroname=text definitions as will fit into the current command line.  DOS is limited to 127 characters in a sin- gle command line.    BUFSIZE=size   MACROS   HISTORY   INSERT   OVERSTRIKE  text  ...  Notes  macroname  Specifies the name of the macro that you want to define.  1. Ordinarily, DOS remembers the last command you typed at the command line. With DOSKEY, however, DOS can store a history of commands in memory. The number of commands retained in memory depends on the size of the buffer  normally 512 bytes . When the buffer is full, DOSKEY eliminates the oldest command to make room for the new command. The buffer contains macros and the history of commands.  2. You can press several keys to recall a command in the history. In addition, you can use many keys and key combinations to edit a command on the command line. These keys and their functions are listed in Appendix D, “DOS and DOS Utility Programs’ Keyboard Commands.”   DOSKEY 5.0 and later—External  703  3. DOSKEY enables you to create macros. A macro, like a batch file, performs one or more DOS commands assigned to a specific name. After you type the name of a macro and press Enter, the macro executes the commands assigned to the macro name. When you create a macro, you can use the following special symbols:  Code $g or $G $g$g or $G$G $l or $L $b or $B $t or $T $$ $1 through $9 $*  Description Redirects output; use instead of > Adds to an output file; use instead of >> Redirects input; use instead of < Indicates piping; use instead of  Separates macro commands Places the dollar sign in the command line Replaceable parameters; same as %1 through %9 in a batch file Replaceable parameter that represents everything typed in the command line after the macro name  When you create a macro, you can include any valid DOS command, including the name of a batch file. You can start a batch file from a macro, but you cannot start a macro from a batch file.  Examples  With DOSKEY installed, you can easily turn the last few DOS commands that you typed into a batch file. Simply ask DOSKEY to display the contents of the command-line history buffer and redirect the output to a file as follows: DOSKEY  HISTORY > MYHIST.BAT  Next, load MYHIST.BAT into an ASCII editor such as EDIT and remove any command lines that you don’t need.  To define a macro, enter the name of the macro followed by the commands you want exe- cuted. Separate the macro name from the commands with an equal sign. For example, the following creates a macro named CDD that changes the current drive and current directory: DOSKEY CDD=$1: $T CD $2  After the CDD macro is defined, you could enter the following command at the DOS prompt to make drive D the current drive and \MYSTUFF the current directory on drive D: C:\>CDD D \MYSTUFF  When the preceding command is executed, the CDD macro runs and executes the following DOS commands: C:\>D:  App F  D:\>CD \MYSTUFF  D:\MYSTUFF>   704  Appendix F Command Reference  Messages  Cannot change BUFSIZE  Error: You cannot change the DOSKEY buffer unless you also use the  REINSTALL switch, which clears the buffer. Insufficient memory to store macro. Use the DOSKEY command with the  BUFSIZE switch to increase available memory.  Warning: Your DOSKEY macros have filled the total space set aside for them. You must enlarge the memory area for macros  the default is 512 bytes  by using the BUFSIZE switch  and the  REINSTALL switch  before you can enter any new macros. Using REINSTALL clears the buffer. Invalid macro definition  Error: You entered an illegal character or command with DOSKEY or attempted to create a DOSKEY macro with an illegal definition. This message appears, for example, if you use a GOTO command in a DOSKEY macro. Correct any errors and carefully retype the macro.  See Also  Chapter 18, “Mastering DOSKEY and Macros” and Appendix D, “DOS and DOS Utility Programs’ Keyboard Commands”  DISK  DOSSHELL  4.0 to 6.0—External The DOSSHELL command starts the DOS Shell program, which is a full-screen graphical shell program that provides an alternative to using the traditional DOS command line. DOSSHELL is not included in the standard DOS 6.22 package but is available on the DOS 6.22 Supplemental disk.  Syntax  DOSSHELL  B   T:screen  G:screen  Parameters and Switches   B  Starts the DOS Shell in black-and-white mode rather than in color.

When you start the DOS Shell without parameters, it uses the display and color set- tings from the last time DOSSHELL was run. To use a different display mode, specify a  T:screen or  G:screen parameter when you start the program. DOS Shell records these settings in the DOSSHELL.INI file.  2. At least 384KB of free conventional memory are required to start the DOS Shell. 3. Each time you start the DOS Shell, it searches the disk for directories and files to dis-  play up-to-date listings in file and tree windows. If you have a large hard disk or a com- plicated directory structure, this search may take a few seconds.  4. Do not start Microsoft Windows from the DOS Shell. If you need to run both pro- grams, start Microsoft Windows first and then run the DOS Shell from Windows.  5. Your DOSSHELL settings are preserved in your DOSSHELL.INI file. The DOS 6.0 installa- tion does not overwrite or modify this file if it exists, which may produce inconsisten- cies on your system  references to BACKUP rather than to MSBACKUP, for example . You can avoid these inconsistencies by renaming DOSSHELL.INI before you install DOS 6.0 and then manually editing changes from the renamed DOSSHELL.INI into the new DOSSHELL.INI. When the DOS 6.0 Setup program installs DOSSHELL, it expands one of three files  CGA.IN_ for CGA monitors, EGA.IN_ for EGA and VGA monitors, or MONO.IN_ for monochrome monitors  from the DOS 6.0 distribution disks and renames it DOSSHELL.INI. To restore your DOS Shell configuration to its defaults, you can expand one of these three files  by using EXPAND  and replace your present copy of DOSSHELL.INI with it.  6. By defining an environment variable named DOSSHELL, you can specify where you would  like DOSSHELL.INI to be located. For instance, to store the DOSSHELL.INI file in the C:\DOS\MSDOSDATA subdirectory, you could add the following SET command to your  App F   706  Appendix F Command Reference  AUTOEXEC.BAT file. SET DOSSHELL=C:\DOS\MSDOSDATA If no environment variable named DOSSHELL is defined, DOS Shell searches for its set- tings file in the directory that contains DOSSHELL.EXE. If DOSSHELL.INI cannot be found, a new one is created.  7. DOS Shell creates any temporary files, including task swapping files, in the subdirecto-  ry pointed to by the TEMP environment variable if it is defined. If TEMP isn’t defined, temporary files are created in the subdirectory that contains DOSSHELL.EXE.  8. If you are running POWER, the clock displayed in the DOS Shell program may slow down  or stop completely. DOS Shell uses a timer to update the onscreen clock, and POWER slows down the timer. Note that only the onscreen clock displayed by DOS Shell is affected. The MS-DOS system clock continues to reflect the correct time.  9. In DOS 4.0, DOS Shell was started by a batch file that recorded all the configuration information needed to run DOS Shell on your system. This version of the DOS Shell was very different from later versions, and most of the information presented here doesn’t apply to it.  Examples  To start the DOS Shell in the default screen mode, enter the following: DOSSHELL  To start the DOS Shell in black-and-white mode, enter the following: DOSSHELL   B  Use this command if you have a black-and-white monitor or a laptop or notebook computer with an LCD screen.  Messages  Not enough memory to run DOSSHELL  Error: Not enough conventional memory is available to start DOSSHELL. The DOS Shell pro- gram requires 384KB of free conventional RAM to load into memory. You may have too many resident programs  TSRs  loaded into memory, in which case you should attempt to remove any that you don’t need. You may be trying to start DOSSHELL from a secondary copy of the command processor launched from another program, in which case you should type EXIT to return to your program, quit the program, and then run DOSSHELL. Not enough free conventional memory to run program  or Not enough free extended memory to run program  Either of these messages can appear when you try to start a program from the DOS Shell without sufficient available memory.

See Also  Chapter 4, “Using the DOS Shell”  DR-DOS  DPMI  DPMI temporarily loads or unloads DOS Protected Mode Interface support for the EMM memory manager. DPMI is normally handled through a switch on the EMM386 drive in the CONFIG.SYS file. This enables you to unload or load it from the command line.  Syntax  DPMI ONOFF  H  Parameters and Switches  ONOFF  ON loads DPMI support; OFF unloads it.   H  Displays abbreviated help.  PC-DOS  DPMS.EXE  DPMS.EXE allows most of the Stacker driver to be stored in extended memory, freeing con- ventional and upper memory for other programs.  App F  Syntax  DEVICE=c:\stacker\dpms.exe  ?   708  Appendix F Command Reference  Parameters and Switches   ?  Displays the abbreviated online help.  Notes  DPMS requires at least a 386 computer with more than 1MB of RAM and a memory manager that provides Virtual Control Program Interface  VCPI  services.  DPMS does not work unless the DPMS.EXE file is stored on the hard disk and referenced by a DEVICE= line in the CONFIG.SYS file.  Examining the CONFIG.SYS file and messages shown when the computer is started helps determine whether DPMS is used.  Stacker Setup automatically uses DPMS when possible. However, if STACKER.INI contains an  EMS,  UM, or  -DPMS switch, Stacker does not use DPMS. Stacker Setup adds the EMS switch only if DPMS cannot be used and if a large drive  more than 400MB  is compressed.  To use EMS, delete any switches that enable DPMS. Using expanded memory  EMS  requires a special memory manager, such as EMM386.  DRIVER.SYS  device driver   3.2 and later— External  The DRIVER.SYS device driver can be used to create an additional drive letter for a floppy disk drive or set the characteristics of a floppy disk drive. For instance, if an external floppy drive is attached to your computer, you can use DRIVER.SYS  or DRIVPARM=  to tell DOS  to assign a drive letter to the drive. A more common use is to create a new drive letter— perhaps one with different characteristics—for a drive.  CONFIG  SYS  DEVICE =  Syntax  DEVICE=drive:\path\DRIVER.SYS   D:num  C   F:type   H:heads   S:sectors  T:tracks  or DEVICEHIGH=drive:\path\DRIVER.SYS   D:num  C   F:type   H:heads  S:sectors  T:tracks  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  Specifies the full path to the DRIVER.SYS file on your system. Setup places the DRIVER.SYS file in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to DRIVER.SYS isn’t specified, DOS looks for the file in the root directory of the startup drive.  Specifies the physical drive number  num . Valid numbers are 0 to 127. DOS assigns floppy drive numbers sequentially, with the first floppy drive as 0, the second as 1, the third as 2, and so on. Note that if you   D:num   DRIVER.SYS  device driver   3.2 and later External  709   C   F:type  have only one floppy disk drive installed, DOS assigns it both letters A and B, but it is still drive 0, not drive 1. This parameter is required, and must be the first parameter specified after the name and location of the DRIVER.SYS file.  Specifies that the drive has change line support. This means that the drive can signal DOS that the medium in it may have been changed. Most newer floppy disk drives have change line support built in. Specifying the  C parameter can speed up access to your floppy drive.  Indicates the type of drive that is being accessed, where type is one of the values in the following table. If you omit this value, a default value  of 2  720KB 3 1 2-inch  is assumed.  Heads  Sides  2  Sectors per Track 9  Tracks per Head  Side  40  type 0  1  2  7  9  Floppy Drive Specifications Double-density 360KB  5 1 4-inch floppy disk drive; includes 160KB, 180KB, 320KB, and 360KB formatted media sizes High-density 1.2MB  5 1 4-inch floppy disk drive Double-density 720KB 3 1 2-inch floppy disk drive High-density 1.44MB 3 1 2-inch floppy disk drive Super high-density 2.88MB 3 1 2-inch floppy disk drive  2  2  2  2  15  9  18  36  80  80  80  80   H:heads   S:sectors   T:tracks  Specifies the number of read write heads  sides  that the drive has. Valid values are 1 to 99. The default value is 2.  Specifies the number of sectors per track for the drive’s media. Valid val- ues are 1 to 99. The default value depends on the  F:type setting or is 9 if  F:type is omitted. See the preceding table.  Specifies the number of tracks per side  head  for the drive’s media. Valid values are 1 to 999. The default value depends on the  F:type setting or is 80 if  F:type is omitted. See the preceding table.  App F   710  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  1. DOS assigns drive letters in a specific order. A and B always refer to the first one or two  floppy drives in the system. If the system has a hard disk, the primary partition is assigned the letter C. Next, any remaining hard disk partitions are assigned letters. After that, each DOS-accessible block device driver listed in CONFIG.SYS is assigned a letter on a first-come, first-served basis.  If DoubleSpace is loaded, it modifies this assignment order by skipping four letters and then working backward. See DBLSPACE for more information.  For instance, if you have two floppy drives and one hard disk  with a single partition  and you include a single DRIVER.SYS line in your CONFIG.SYS file, the letter D would be assigned. DRIVER.SYS displays a message informing you of the letter assigned when it is installed.  See the first message in the “Messages” section.   2. Most newer floppy disk drives can signal the computer when their drive door has been  opened. Because opening the door implies that the disk in the drive may have been changed, this feature is referred to as change line support. Unless you are installing a 360KB 5 1 4-inch disk drive, the chances are good that your new floppy drive has change line support built in. Specifying the  C parameter can speed up DOS access to the drive.  3. MS-DOS 6 seems to have problems recognizing that the medium in a drive has  changed when the medium does not have a volume serial number. Disks most likely to not have serial numbers are ones formatted by DOS versions before 4.0, preformatted disks, and disks formatted with some third-party utilities. This is a good reason to make sure that the hardware change line is working for your disk drive. If DOS is unaware that you have changed the disk in a floppy disk drive, it may write the wrong file allocation table  FAT  to the disk, destroying any data that was previously stored on it.  4. If you specify the  F:type parameter, you can omit the  H:heads,  S:sectors, and   T:tracks parameters, and vice versa. You can use any combination of these parameters; the last ones entered have precedence.  5. Many times, the DRIVER.SYS device driver is simpler and more flexible to use than   DRIVPARM=, although both often achieve the same results. They can both configure logi- cal drives, but only DRIVER.SYS can create a new one. DRIVPARM=, however, uses no addi- tional memory in your system.  6. You cannot use DRIVER.SYS to reconfigure an existing drive to support a format it was not made for. For instance, DRIVER.SYS cannot be used to allow an older 360KB 5 1 2- inch disk drive to read the newer 1.2MB disks. DRIVER.SYS can instruct DOS to make use of only the capabilities that both DOS and the drive support.   DRIVPARM=  3.2 and later—Internal  711  Examples  Suppose that your system has two 5 1 4-inch disk drives and a hard disk. To configure an external 1.44MB 3 1 2-inch floppy disk drive that you have attached to your system, enter a line such as the following in your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=C:\DOS\DRIVER.SYS   D:2   F:7  After loading, DRIVER.SYS displays the following message: Loaded External Disk Driver for Drive D.  Or, if your system has a single 1.44MB 3 1 2-inch floppy and a hard drive, you might want to create an alias for the floppy drive so that you can format 720KB disks without specifying any switches for FORMAT. To create a 720KB alias for it, you might enter the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DRIVER.SYS   D:0   F:2  As far as DOS is concerned, drive D refers to a 720KB 3 1 2-inch floppy drive. Drives A and B are unchanged and refer to a 1.44MB 3 1 2-inch floppy drive. All three drive letters refer to the same physical drive, but D has different characteristics from A and B.  Messages  Loaded External Disk Driver for Drive letter  Information: After installing DRIVER.SYS, DOS displays this message to tell you which drive letter has been assigned.  See Also  DRIVPARM=  DRIVPARM=  CONFIG  SYS  3.2 and later—Internal  DRIVPARM is an advanced command that defines the characteristics of an existing block device, such as a disk drive, and associates a drive letter with it. Normally, you use this com- mand only when instructed to do so by the manufacturer of the drive you are installing. DRIVPARM= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  DRIVPARM= D:num  C   F:type  H:heads  I   N   S:sectors   T:tracks  Parameters and Switches   D:num  Specifies the physical drive number  num . Valid numbers are 0 to 255, where drive A is 0, drive B is 1, drive C is 2, and so on. This parameter is required and must be the first parameter on the command line.  App F   712  Appendix F Command Reference   C   F:type  Specifies that the drive has change line support. This means that the drive can signal DOS that the medium in it may have been changed.

Valid val- ues are 1 to 99. The default value depends on the  F:type setting.  Specifies the number of tracks per side  head  for the drive’s media. Valid values are 1 to 999. The default value depends on the  F:type setting.  Notes  1. In many cases, the DRIVER.SYS device driver is simpler and more flexible to use than  DRIVPARM=, although both often achieve the same results. They can both configure logi- cal drives, but only DRIVER.SYS can create a new one. However, DRIVPARM= uses no addi- tional memory in your system.   DRIVPARM=  3.2 and later—Internal  713  2. In most cases, the DRIVPARM= line should come immediately after the line that loads the device driver for the drive you are configuring. Normally, the instructions for installing the drive’s device driver tell you which parameters to use with DRIVPARM=. An exception occurs when you are adding support for a 3 1 2-inch floppy drive attached to a standard floppy controller, which requires no device driver.  3. Most newer floppy disk drives can signal the computer when their drive door has been  opened. Because opening the door implies that the disk in the drive may have been changed, this feature is referred to as change line support. Unless you are installing a 360KB 5 1 4-inch disk drive, the chances are good that your new floppy drive has change line support built in. Specifying the  C parameter can speed up DOS access to the drive.  4. MS-DOS 6 seems to have problems recognizing that the medium in a drive has  changed when the medium does not have a volume serial number. Disks most likely to not have serial numbers are ones formatted by DOS versions before 4.0, preformatted disks, and disks formatted with some third-party utilities. This is a good reason to make sure that the hardware change line is working for your disk drive. If DOS is unaware that you have changed the disk in a floppy disk drive, it may write the wrong file alloca- tion table  FAT  to the disk, destroying any data that was previously stored on it.  5. Do not use DRIVPARM= unless the installation instructions for the hardware or software you are installing in your system tells you to do so. Normally, DRIVPARM= can be used only to support additions to your system rather than reconfigure existing hardware or software.  6. You cannot use DRIVER.SYS to reconfigure an existing drive to support a format it was not made for. For instance, DRIVER.SYS cannot be used to allow an older 360KB 5 1 2- inch disk drive to read the newer 1.2MB disks. DRIVER.SYS can instruct DOS to make use of only the capabilities that both DOS and the drive support.  Examples  Probably the most common use of the DRIVPARM= command is to create a drive letter for a  3 1 2-inch floppy disk drive that is not supported by the ROM BIOS in that computer. The following line defines the 3 1 2-inch 1.44MB floppy disk drive as drive D  3 , using the default values for heads, sectors, and tracks: DRIVPARM= D:3   F:7   I  If the floppy disk drive were the second one in your system and supported only 720KB media, you would use the following line: DRIVPARM= D:1   I  Note that you can omit the  F:2 because, in this case, the default value is correct. If you run the preceding command on a system in which the second floppy drive is a 1.44MB 3 1 2- inch drive, you can read only 720KB disks; you cannot read 1.44MB disks.

You type them on the same line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file as follows: SET E= s  dm  80  The ECHO command has two functions. First, you can use it to display messages onscreen from a batch file. Second, you can use ECHO to control whether DOS displays onscreen each command line from the batch file before executing the command line.  2.0 and later—Internal  To display a message, use the following format:  ECHO message   ECHO 2.0 and later—Internal  717  To turn on or off the display of commands and other batch-command messages, use the  following format:  To see the status of ECHO, use the following format:  Parameters and Switches  message  Specifies the text of the message to be displayed onscreen.  Specifies whether or not each command line in the batch file is displayed before being executed. ECHO ON turns on the display of command lines. ECHO OFF turns off the display of command lines. Note that this setting has no effect on the out- put generated by a command, only on the display of the command line that DOS is about to execute.  ECHO onoff  ECHO  onoff  Notes  1. Setting ECHO ON or OFF controls only the display of command lines from the batch file  before they are executed. It has no effect on the output generated by a DOS command. The message generated by the PAUSE command, Press any key to continue..., and the message generated by the COPY command, 1 file s  copied, are examples of out- put generated by a command. They are not suppressed by ECHO OFF.  2. When ECHO is ON, DOS displays each command line before executing it. This capability can be handy when you are debugging a batch file. After the batch file is working cor- rectly, you generally want to include an ECHO OFF command at the beginning of the batch file to suppress echoing command lines. Using ECHO OFF can speed up the batch file a little as well.  3. You can suppress the display of a single batch file line by typing @ as the first character in the line. The command itself is executed, but the command line is not displayed. For example, when you type the line @ECHO OFF, the command line ECHO OFF is not dis- played, but the ECHO flag is set to OFF.  4. To display a blank line onscreen, enter the command ECHO followed by a period  with no  intervening spaces  in your batch file. This is a special use for the ECHO command and can make your batch file screen output more attractive and readable.  5. You cannot display pipe characters    or redirection symbols     in an ECHO mes-  sage. Redirection symbols are intercepted by the parser and are acted on.  6. DOS starts every batch file with ECHO ON. The ECHO setting  ON or OFF  remains in effect  until DOS completes batch processing or encounters another ECHO ON or ECHO OFF command. If one batch file invokes another, the ECHO setting from the first batch file remains in effect. When DOS returns control to the command line, ECHO is restored to the ON state.  App F   718  Appendix F Command Reference  7. If you issue an ECHO OFF command at the DOS prompt, the DOS prompt is not dis-  played. You can still see the commands you are entering, however. To restore the DOS prompt, enter ECHO ON.  8. You can use ECHO to send ANSI commands to your screen. If ANSI.SYS is active in mem-  ory and the message displayed by ECHO contains legal ANSI commands, they are acted on rather than displayed. You can use this technique to display very complex, multicol- ored screens from a batch file. To enter ANSI commands into your batch file, you need an editor that enables you to enter Escape characters  ASCII 27  into the text.  9. To suppress the output of a command, use I O redirection to the null device  NUL . For example, to suppress the 1 file s  copied message generated by the COPY com- mand, use the following format: COPY  file1.ext file2.ext >  NUL The command output is sent to the null device instead of to the console, so it is not dis- played onscreen.  If you redirect the output of a program that is going to remain resident in memory  TSR , you may waste one of the file handles that DOS has available for programs to use. When you redirect the output of a program to the NUL device, the NUL device is assigned a file handle that isn’t released until the program terminates. In the case of resident programs, this file handle often remains unavailable until you restart DOS. This can cause problems if you are in the habit of suppressing the output of resident programs loaded in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Examples  Batch files commonly begin with the following line: @ECHO  OFF  This command turns ECHO OFF at the beginning of the batch file, and the at sign  @  tells DOS not to display the ECHO OFF command itself. If you start a batch file with this com- mand, no unnecessary screen output is displayed.  Another very common use for ECHO is to explain the inclusion of a PAUSE command in a batch file. For example, to instruct the user to insert a particular floppy disk in drive B, include the following lines in a batch file: ECHO Insert the Working Backup disk in drive B: ECHO. ECHO Press Ctrl-Break to abort the backup, or PAUSE  Assuming that ECHO is OFF when these commands are executed, the following messages are displayed: Insert the Working Backup disk in drive B:  Press Ctrl-Break to abort the backup, or Press any key to continue...   EDIT 5.0 and later—External  719  Note that the PAUSE message is anticipated in the ECHO messages. If you use the CHOICE com- mand instead, you can control all the text that is displayed onscreen.  To display a menu, you can use ECHO to display a screenful of messages. Then, you can let the user pick an item from the list by using the CHOICE command, as the following lines demonstrate: @ECHO OFF CLS ECHO. ECHO F  First action ECHO S  Second action ECHO T  Third action ECHO. CHOICE  C:FST “Choose an action “  The CLS command is often used with ECHO to control the amount of distracting information that is left behind on the screen by other commands. Note that the ECHO.  ECHO period  command is used to display blank lines.  Blank lines included in a batch file are ignored by DOS and are not displayed onscreen.   See Also  @, ANSI.SYS, CHOICE, CLS, and PAUSE  Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files”  EDIT  5.0 and later—External The EDIT command activates the DOS full-screen ASCII text-file editor. EDIT is very handy for writing batch files or making changes to your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file. Although limited to working on one file at a time, EDIT offers block copy and move operations as well as search and replace features. EDIT uses the editor built into QBASIC.EXE; so to use EDIT, QBASIC.EXE must be in one of the subdirectories listed in your PATH variable.  Syntax  EDIT pathname   B   G   H   NOHI  Parameters and Switches  pathname  Specifies the file you want EDIT to load. If no drive is specified, the current drive is assumed. If no subdirectory path is specified, the current directory is assumed. Wildcards are not allowed.  Specifies that EDIT should use colors more appropriate for a black-and-white  monochrome  or LCD display.  Specifies that EDIT should use the fastest screen-updating method for a CGA monitor. Don’t specify the  G switch if you see “snow” on your monitor.   B   G  App F   720  Appendix F Command Reference   H  Specifies that EDIT should display 43 lines on an EGA monitor or 50 lines on a VGA monitor.   NOHI  Specifies that EDIT should limit itself to 8 colors rather than 16.  See Also  Chapter 15, “Using the DOS Editor”  DISK  AVOID  EDLIN  1.0 to 5.0—External EDLIN is an old-fashioned, line-oriented text editor that is much more awkward to use than EDIT. If you have anything else to use for editing ASCII text files, you probably should avoid using EDLIN. The only good thing about EDLIN is that the program file is small. EDLIN is no longer dis- tributed with the standard DOS package but is available on the DOS 6 Supplemental Disk. Instructions for using EDLIN are in the COMMANDS.TXT file included on the Supplemental Disk.  See Also EDIT  CONFIG  SYS  DEVICE =  EGA.SYS  device driver   5.0 and later—External Because of the way EGA display adapters are made, they present certain problems for task- switching software. EGA.SYS attempts to solve these problems. If you have an EGA display and use the task-switching functions of the DOS Shell program, you need to load EGA.SYS. You must load EGA.SYS in either a DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.

Setup places the EGA.SYS file in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to EGA.SYS isn’t specified, DOS looks for the file in the root directory of the startup drive.  Notes  1. You can use EGA.SYS only if your system uses an EGA display. With any other type of  display, EGA.SYS does not load into memory.   EMM386 5.0 and later—External  721  2. In addition to being required by the task swapper in DOS Shell, EGA.SYS may be  required by Microsoft Windows. Third-party task-switching software often requires the assistance of EGA.SYS or a similar driver that it provides. You can have  and need  only one EGA.SYS type driver loaded at a time.  3. If you have an EGA display and you use the Microsoft Mouse driver, you may be able  to save some memory by loading EGA.SYS before loading your mouse driver into memo- ry. Many of the functions in EGA.SYS are duplicated in the Microsoft Mouse driver, and if it finds EGA support already in place, the mouse driver doesn’t load those functions.  Examples  To load the EGA.SYS device driver into upper memory, you might add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\EGA.SYS  See Also  DOSSHELL and MOUSE  PC-DOS  EJECT  Syntax  EJECT drive:  ?

Your computer may stop responding if you use this switch.   DOS 6.0 and later  Directs EMM386.EXE to display status and error mes- sages when DOS boots. This switch can be abbreviated as V.  You can also get status and error messages by holding down the Alt key while DOS boots.    DOS 6.0 and later  Reserves the specified memory address range for Microsoft Windows and prevents EMM386.EXE from using that area of memory. mmmm and nnnn can have values ranging from A000H through FFFFH and are rounded down to the nearest 4KB boundary. The X switch overrides the WIN switch if their ranges overlap. The WIN switch overrides the RAM, ROM, and I switches if their ranges overlap.   DOS 6.0 and later  Prevents EMM386.EXE from loading any part of itself into upper memory. Normally, EMM386.EXE uses about 5KB of upper memory for itself. Specifying this switch makes more UMB space avail- able but increases the size of EMM386.EXE in conventional memory.   DOS 6.0 and later  Specifies a range of memory for shadow RAM, which is read-only memory  ROM  copied into faster RAM. mmmm and nnnn can have values ranging from A000H through FFFFH and are rounded down to the nearest 4KB boundary.   DOS 6.0 and later  Prevents EMM386.EXE from moving the extended BIOS data from conventional memory to upper memory.

Syntax  EXE2BIN exe_file binary_file  Parameters and Switches  exe_file  binary_file  Notes  The .EXE file to be converted into a memory-image file. If no drive is spec- ified, the current drive is assumed. If no subdirectory path is specified, the current subdirectory is assumed. A filename is required, but if you don’t specify an extension, .EXE is assumed. Wildcards are not allowed.  The name of the memory-image file to be created. If no drive is specified, the current drive is assumed. If no subdirectory path is specified, the cur- rent subdirectory is assumed. If no filename is specified, the filename desig- nated in exe_file is used. If no extension is specified, a .BIN extension is added.  1. EXE2BIN is a programming utility that converts .EXE  executable  program files to .COM  or .BIN  memory-image  files. The resulting program consumes less disk space and loads slightly faster. Unless you use a compiler-based programming language, you prob- ably will never use this command.  2. Before EXE2BIN converts an .EXE file to memory-image format, a number of require-  ments have to be met. In most cases, a program has to be written with this transforma- tion in mind. You cannot convert the typical .EXE program file by using EXE2BIN.  C:\>  EXIT  2.0 and later—Internal You can use EXIT to remove a temporary copy of COMMAND.COM from memory. Typically, you use this command to return to an application program that gives you access to the DOS prompt while it’s running. EXIT can remove only temporary copies of COMMAND.COM; it cannot accidentally remove the permanent copy that is loaded when your computer starts up.  App F  Syntax  EXIT   728  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  1. EXIT has no effect on a copy of COMMAND.COM loaded with the  P switch. Normally, you load COMMAND.COM with the  P switch only in the SHELL= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. Any additional copies that you run  from a batch file, for example  can be removed from memory with the EXIT command.  2. EXIT is used to close a DOS window in Microsoft Windows. It terminates the tempo-  rary copy of COMMAND.COM that Windows launched to create the DOS window.  See Also  COMMAND  “Using EXIT to Leave the Current Copy of the Command Processor” in Chapter 10  EXPAND  5.0 and later—External You can use the EXPAND command to copy a compressed, unusable file from the DOS distri- bution disks to an uncompressed, usable form.  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  Syntax  EXPAND source1  source2  ...  destination  Parameters and Switches  source1  source2  destination  The name of the compressed source file. If no drive is provided, the current drive is assumed. If no subdirectory path is provided, the current subdirec- tory is assumed. If this parameter is omitted, you are prompted for the source and destination. Wildcards are not allowed.  Additional compressed source files. You can designate as many as can fit in the 127-character limit for a DOS command line. You cannot specify addi- tional source parameters without also specifying a destination parameter.  If only one source file is specified, destination can be the full name and location of the destination file, with normal default assumptions. If more than one source file is specified, only a drive and or path can be specified for the destination. If destination is omitted, DOS prompts you for the name and location to use for expanded files.  Rules  1. You can use EXPAND to decompress files from the DOS distribution disks only. 2. If you specify more than one compressed file, you can specify only a destination drive  or path  not a filename .   EXPAND 5.0 and later—External  729  3. If you don’t specify a compressed file or a destination, EXPAND prompts you for the miss-  ing information.  4. If you use EXPAND on a file that is not compressed, an error message appears  see the first item in the following “Messages” section . Despite the error message, the file is still copied to the destination; it just isn’t expanded.  1. Files stored on the original DOS 5.0 and 6.0 disks are compressed files. This compres-  sion enables more data to be stored on fewer disks. Before you can use a file on these disks, however, you must decompress the file.  2. When you use SETUP to install DOS, the files are decompressed as they are transferred  to the subdirectory you chose to install DOS into. If you delete a file accidentally or if a file becomes corrupted, you must retrieve the file again from the original DOS disk. EXPAND transfers the file and decompresses it in the process. Consider EXPAND to be a kind of “one-way” COPY command.  3. Refer to the file PACKING.LST for a list of which files are included on each of the DOS distribution disks. Microsoft marks the compressed files by replacing the last letter of the extension with an underscore  _ . Setup copies the PACKING.LST file into your DOS subdirectory when it installs MS-DOS 6.  To expand MOVE.EXE from DOS distribution disk 1 to the C:\DOS subdirectory, enter the following line: EXPAND  A:MOVE.EX_  C:\DOS\MOVE.EXE  Input file ‘filename’ already in expanded format  Error: You attempted to expand an uncompressed file. Verify that you specified the correct compressed file. Error in compressed input file format: filename  Error: The compressed file was corrupted. Use a different copy of the compressed file.

FASTOPEN remains in memory  TSR , so be careful not to run it more than once. If you use FASTOPEN, you should add it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  AVOID  Syntax  FASTOPEN  drive:=num ...   X  Parameters and Switches  Specifies the name of the drive for which directory information should be held in memory.  Specifies the number of directory entries to be held in memory  10 to 999 . The default is 48. The equal sign is optional.  Specifies the number of additional drive:=num parameters you need.  Tells DOS to use expanded memory to store the information buffered by FASTOPEN.  1. You must specify the name of at least one drive for which entries are to be kept in  memory. The drive cannot be a floppy drive.  2. You can use FASTOPEN for up to 24 nonfloppy drives, for a total of 999 files. In the com-  mand line, simply type the additional drive names, separated by spaces.  3. Do not use FASTOPEN from the DOS Shell or when you are running Windows or a disk  defragmentation program, such as DEFRAG.  4. If you provide nnn, the value must be between 10 and 999, inclusive. The minimum  value for FASTOPEN is 10, or the maximum level of your deepest directory plus 1— whichever is greater.  App F   732  Appendix F Command Reference  5. You cannot run more than one copy of FASTOPEN. If you want to change FASTOPEN set-  tings, you must reboot your computer.  6. Each FASTOPEN entry you specify increases the size of FASTOPEN by approximately 48 bytes.  Notes  1. FASTOPEN works by keeping directory information in memory. Because disk buffers  already hold FAT information, FASTOPEN enables DOS to search memory for a file or subdirectory entry, to locate the corresponding FAT entry quickly, and to open the file. If you have many files and use FASTOPEN effectively, you can increase DOS’s performance.  2. As is true of BUFFERS, no predetermined best number exists. The default value of 48  works well in many installations. If your subdirectories run many levels deep or if you use many files, specifying a larger number can improve performance. Using too large a value for nnn  greater than 200 , however, slows the system. DOS spends more time examining in-memory directory entries than rereading the entries from the disk.  3. Alternatively, FASTOPEN can be loaded from your CONFIG.SYS file with the INSTALL= com-  mand rather than in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. With DOS 6, there is no advantage to either placement. Just make sure that you do not attempt to load FASTOPEN from both your CONFIG.SYS and your AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  4. In most cases, you should use the SMARTDRV disk cache instead of FASTOPEN. SMARTDRV has  fewer dangerous interactions with other programs and can speed up your computer even more than FASTOPEN. If you don’t have enough memory to use SMARTDRV effectively, consider using the BUFFERS= command to optimize disk-access time.  See Also  BUFFERS= and SMARTDRV  “Using FASTOPEN” in Chapter 7  The FC command enables you to compare files for differences. Using the FC switches, you can configure it to do a strict byte-for-byte comparison  as COMP does  or to attempt to resynchronize after differences are detected.  3.3 and later—External  FC  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  Syntax  For ASCII text files, use the following syntax: FC  pathname1  pathname2  A   C   L   LBbuffer  N   T   W   resync  For binary files, use the following syntax: FC pathname1  pathname2  B   FC 3.3 and later—External  733  Parameters and Switches  pathname1  pathname2  Specifies a file or group of files to compare. Normal drive and subdirectory defaults apply, and wildcards are permitted. This parameter must match at least one existing file.  Specifies the file or group of files that should be compared to pathname1. Normal drive and subdirectory defaults apply, and wildcards are permitted. Wildcards used with FC are interpreted the same way they are with COPY and REN:. Missing characters in the filename are replaced with the corresponding characters in pathname1. If this file isn’t found, FC moves on to the next set of files.  Abbreviates the display of an ASCII comparison to the first and last lines of each group of differences.  Forces a binary file comparison, which involves a byte-by-byte comparison with no synchronization after a mismatch. This switch is the default for files with .EXE, .COM, .SYS, .OBJ, .LIB, and .BIN extensions.  Causes DOS to ignore the case of letters.  Compares files in ASCII mode, which involves a line-by-line comparison with resynchronization attempted after a mismatch. This switch is the default for files without .EXE, .COM, .SYS, .OBJ, .LIB, and .BIN extensions.   LBbuffer  Sets the internal buffer to the number of lines specified by buffer. A com- parison is terminated if the files have more than this number of consecutive differing lines.  Displays line numbers for ASCII comparisons.  Suppresses expansion of tabs to spaces.  Compresses tabs and spaces to a single space and causes tabs and spaces to be ignored if those characters are at the beginning or end of a line.   resync  Sets the number of lines  1 through 9  that must match before the files are considered to be resynchronized. The default is 2.  1. A difference in a binary file comparison is displayed as follows:  aaaaaaaa: xx yy aaaaaaaa represents the hexadecimal address of a mismatching pair of bytes, xx is the mismatching hexadecimal byte from the first file, and yy is the mismatching hexadeci- mal byte from the second file.  2. If you use a wildcard in the first filename, DOS compares all the specified files with the  second filename. If you use a wildcard in the second filename, DOS uses the corre- sponding value from the first filename in the second filename.

Most programs written since that time use file handles, not file control blocks  FCBs , to open files. The FCBS= command sets the maximum num- ber of open files a program using DOS 1.0 FCBs can have. With newer programs, you usu- ally don’t need this command. FCBS= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  FCBS=maxopen  Parameters and Switches  Notes  maxopen  The maximum number of open FCBs that a program can use. Any value in the range of 1 to 255 is allowed. The default value is 4.  1. Not many programs use FCBs anymore. Include the FCBS= command in your  CONFIG.SYS file only if a program asks you to, or if an old utility starts mysteriously fail- ing. Otherwise, accept DOS’s default setting of four FCBs. If you set maxopen to 1, you might find that certain small command-line utilities begin to fail.  2. Be aware that FCBs are ancient history. If you depend on any programs that require  them, you are living on borrowed time, and you should start looking for replacements. If you receive a new program that asks you to use the FCBS= command, complain  loud- ly  to the manufacturer. Microsoft has carried this legacy from CP M for several years   FDISK 2.0 and later—External  735  now, and with every release of DOS comes the chance that FCBs will no longer be sup- ported.  3.

DOS 5 and 6 have no need for the neverclose argument and will ignore it.  See Also FILES=  “Accessing Files through FCBS” in Chapter 19  !DANGER  FDISK  2.0 and later—External FDISK is a full-screen program that prepares a hard disk to accept an operating system, such as DOS. It sets up partitions on a hard disk as well as designates which partitions are used to start up the computer if no floppy disk is in drive A. On a new hard drive, you must run FDISK before you can use the FORMAT command on the drive.  FDISK is an extremely dangerous command. Making any changes with FDISK effectively deletes all the information on your hard drive. MS-DOS 6 does not include any utilities with which you can recover information lost through the use of FDISK.  Syntax  FDISK  STATUS  Parameters and Switches  Rules   STATUS   DOS 6.0 and later  Displays some partition information without starting FDISK.  App F  1. You must use FDISK to create a partition on a hard disk before you can use FORMAT to  format the hard disk.  2. You can change the size of a partition only by deleting existing partitions and creating  new ones. This procedure deletes all data in the partitions.   736  Appendix F Command Reference  3. FDISK does not work with SUBST aliases, Interlnk drives, network drives, CD-ROM  drives, or removable drives of any kind. FDISK works only with hard drives that are sup- ported by the ROM BIOS in your computer. FDISK does not work with hard drives that require you to load a device driver in your CONFIG.SYS file to operate.  Notes  1. Although Setup places FDISK in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default, consider copying FDISK.EXE to a floppy disk and deleting it from your hard drive. If FDISK.EXE isn’t on your hard disk, no one can run it, thus avoiding the possible data loss that could result from someone’s curiosity.  2. If you need to use FDISK, back up your hard disk; make sure that you have a bootable floppy disk with at least the FORMAT command and your backup software on it. After FDISK has finished with your hard drive, you cannot boot from it  or even read it  until you have reformatted the drive.  3. The MIRROR command can save partition information into a file, which can be used by the UNFORMAT command to restore a damaged partition table. Although this capability is still a part of UNFORMAT, the MIRROR command is no longer distributed with DOS and is available only on the Supplemental Disk. Before you use FDISK, you might want to get a copy of MIRROR and save your partition information so that you can restore it if you have problems.  4. Starting with DOS 3.3, you can use FDISK to create multiple logical partitions on a sin- gle drive. In DOS 4.0, FDISK and DOS were upgraded to handle partitions larger than 32MB. The maximum size of a single partition for the DOS 6 version of FDISK is 2GB.  5. If you plan to use more than one operating system, use FDISK to partition part of the hard disk for DOS and another part of the hard disk for the other operating system.  See Also  MIRROR, UNDELETE, and UNFORMAT  “Dividing a Hard Disk with FDISK” in Chapter 7  DR-DOS  FILELINK  FILELINK is a utility to transfer files between two computers via a serial or parallel port con- nection. The FILELINK command with no parameters starts the FILELINK utility in full- screen mode. This command has so many command-line parameters that it is highly recommended you run it without any parameters to start the full-screen utility rather than use it via the command line.   FILES= 2.0 and later—Internal  737  FILES=  CONFIG  SYS  2.0 and later—Internal  When a program tries to open a file, DOS assigns that file a handle, which is just a fancy name for an ID number. The FILES= command sets the maximum number of file handles that DOS has available for programs to use. FILES= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  FILES=maxopen  Parameters and Switches  Notes  maxopen  The maximum number of open file handles that DOS allows. Any value in the range of 8 to 255 is allowed. The default value is 8.  1. Always specify a value for FILES= in your CONFIG.SYS file. DOS’s default value of 8 is much too low for today’s software programs. You typically need around 30 to 40 file handles, perhaps more if you are running programs such as Microsoft Windows. A good minimum setting is 20.  2. If a program attempts to open a file when DOS has no more file handles available, it is  denied access to the file. DOS does not close open file handles, unlike FCBs, while a program is running.  If you are in the habit of redirecting the output to the NUL device when you load resident software in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you may be wasting file handles. Each such redirec- tion unnecessarily ties up one file handle until you restart your computer.  3. Each file handle available to programs increases the size of DOS by approximately 60  bytes.  4. Most programs display a meaningful message if they run out of file handles. If this hap- pens, increase the FILES= setting in your CONFIG.SYS file by 5 and restart your computer.  5. Many software installation programs inspect the setting you are using for FILES= and  may even increase it without telling you. Always look through your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files after installing new software, and make sure that any modifications they’ve made are acceptable to you.  App F  Examples  The following line sets the maximum number of open file handles to 30: FILES=30   738  Appendix F Command Reference  “Using the FILES Command” in Chapter 19  See Also FCBS=  PC-DOS  FILEUP  Syntax  FILEUP  ?

DISK  BATCH  FILE  FIND  2.0 and later—External The FIND command displays all the lines of the designated files that match  or do not match, depending on the switches used  the specified string.  Syntax  FIND  V   C   N   I  “string” pathname  ...  Parameters and Switches  “string”  pathname  ...   C  Represents the characters you want to find. The characters must be enclosed in quotation marks.  Indicates the file that you want to search. All the normal drive and subdirec- tory defaults apply, but you cannot use wildcards. If you omit pathname, FIND acts as a filter, searching input that has been redirected to it.  Indicates that you can enter as many pathname parameters as necessary.  Displays a count of the total number of lines that contain “string”.   FIND  2.0 and later—External  739  Specifies that the search is not case sensitive  DOS 5.0 and later versions .  Displays lines that contain “string”, preceded by the file line number.  Displays lines that do not contain “string”.  Exit Codes  ERRORLEVEL Value  Meaning  FIND completed successfully and found at least one match.  FIND completed successfully but found no matches.  FIND aborted due to an error and cannot report whether any matches were found.  1. You can use more than one file specification. All file specifications must appear after the  string and must be separated by spaces.  2. If you do not provide any file specifications, FIND expects information from the key-  board  standard input .  3. If you use switches with FIND, you must place them between FIND and the string. Most  DOS commands require that you place switches at the end of the command line.  4. You must enclose the string in double quotation marks. To use the double–quotation  mark character itself in the string, use two double quotation marks in a row.  5. Wildcards are not allowed in file specifications. You can get the effect of wildcards by  using FIND in a FOR command.   I   N   V  0  1  2  Rules  Notes  1. FIND is one of several filters provided with DOS 3.0 and later versions. The command  can find lines that contain strings and those that do not. FIND also can number and count lines of text, instead of simply displaying them.  2. This filter is useful when it is combined with DOS I O redirection. You can redirect the FIND command’s output to a file by using the > redirection symbol. Because FIND accepts a sequence of files to search, you do not have to redirect the input to FIND.  App F  Examples  To search README.TXT for “Microsoft”, use the following command: FIND  “Microsoft”  C:\DOS\README.TXT  To search all batch files in the current directory for “default”, use the following command: FOR  %%A  IN   *.BAT   DO  FIND  “default”  %%A   740  Appendix F Command Reference  To determine the path and filenames for all batch files on the current disk, use this com- mand: DIR  \   S   B    FIND  “.BAT”  See Also  MORE and SORT  “The FIND Filter” in Chapter 13  FOR  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  2.0 and later—Internal You can use the FOR command to repeat a single command, executing it once for each mem- ber of a list or group of files. Unlike most of the other batch commands, FOR can be very useful from both the command line as well as in a batch file.  Syntax  When used in a batch file, the syntax is as follows:  FOR  %%variable IN   set   DO  command parameters  When used on the DOS command line, the syntax is as follows: FOR %variable IN   set   DO  command parameters  Parameters and Switches  variable  Specifies a single character DOS uses to represent the current value of set. You can use any character for variable except the digits 0 through 9, the redirection symbols   , and  , and the slash    . In a batch file, variable must be preceded by two percent signs  %% , but on the DOS command line only one is used.  Specifies one or more words or pathnames separated by spaces or commas. Wildcards are allowed in the filename.ext portion of any pathname speci- fied. None of the members of set can include embedded spaces. The enclos- ing parentheses are required.  Represents the DOS command to be executed for each word or file in the set. Almost all DOS internal or external commands can be used, with the notable exception of the FOR command itself.  set  command  parameters  Represents any parameters you would like to pass to the command being exe- cuted. Normally, one or more occurrences of variable are used in the com- mand parameters to pass the current value of set to the command.   Notes  FOR 2.0 and later—Internal  741  1. You can use more than one word or file pathname in the set. Use spaces or commas to separate each word or file pathname from the next. Any or all parts of a pathname may be used, but wildcards are allowed only in the filename and extension portions.  2. No member of the set can include embedded spaces. In other words, you can’t use  variable to replace more than a single “word.”  3. You must precede every occurrence of variable with two percent signs in a batch file and one percent sign at the DOS prompt. The reason for this difference is that each line in a batch file is passed through a routine called a parser, which fills in any replace- able parameters before DOS executes each command. The parser removes any single percent signs it finds; if two percent signs in a row are encountered, however, one will remain after the parser is finished. By the time DOS executes the command, only one of the two percent signs you typed remains. When you execute the FOR command from the DOS prompt, the line isn’t parsed, and no percent signs are removed.  4. variable becomes each literal word or filename in set. If wildcards are used, each file matched becomes a member of the set. The DO command executes once for each value in the set.  5. variable can be used in the command portion of the FOR command as well as in the   parameters portion. This capability can be useful if you want to execute a series of com- mands. You can use the variable as many times as you need to after the DO keyword. It will be replaced with the current member of set every time it appears.  6. You cannot nest FOR..IN..DO commands. That is, you cannot use FOR as the command executed in the DO portion of a FOR..IN..DO loop. All other DOS internal and external commands are legal.  7. If you execute a batch file directly in the DO portion of the FOR loop, batch file process- ing ends when that batch file terminates, and control never is returned to the FOR loop. To avoid this situation, use the CALL or COMMAND  C commands to execute batch files in FOR..IN..DO loops.  8. If you use a variable name that is more than one character long or if you omit IN, the  parentheses around set, or DO, DOS displays a syntax error message.  9. Avoid using redirection symbols   , and   with the FOR command. In general, DOS  ignores output redirection, and most redirected input will fail.  10. Do not attempt to use the “at” sign  @  to suppress the display of the command in the  DO loop. DOS does not interpret the @ correctly and searches for an executable file that begins with an “at” sign. To accomplish the same thing, use ECHO OFF before executing the FOR command.  11. Although doing so is legal, you can’t use the GOTO command to jump to a series of labels  in a batch file from the DO portion of a FOR command. The GOTO command works just fine, but there is no mechanism available that enables you to return to the FOR loop when the section of the batch file that you jumped to is finished. To accomplish this task, you have to use the CALL command to call separate batch files instead of jumping to sections in the same batch file.  App F   742  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  12. Be very careful if you are using destructive commands such as DEL or DELTREE in a FOR loop. Although you are debugging the FOR command, you might want to substitute the DIR command, which does not do any harm if anything goes wrong. Make sure that you think through every possible situation. Also, make sure that the wrong files won’t be deleted before putting any batch file with a destructive FOR loop into use.  Suppose that you want to back up all settings files that Windows uses from a batch file. By combining the COPY command with FOR, you could accomplish this with the following line in your batch file: FOR  %%A  IN   INI  GRP  PAR  DAT   DO  COPY  C:\WINDOWS\*.%%A  A:\  Assuming that you had previously prompted to insert the backup disk in drive A, the FOR command would execute the COPY command once for each type of file  .INI, .GRP, .PAR, and .DAT  in which Windows typically saves configuration information.  To execute the same command from the DOS prompt, use single percent signs rather than double ones, as shown here: FOR  %A  IN   INI  GRP  PAR  DAT   DO  COPY  C:\WINDOWS\*.%A  A:\  You can use the FOR command to execute a command a specific number of times. For exam- ple, to display five blank lines from a batch file, you could include the following command: FOR  %%A  IN   1  2  3  4  5   DO  ECHO.  After all, there is no rule that says you have to use the %%A variable in the DO portion of the command. The preceding FOR loop repeats the ECHO.  ECHO period  command once for each member in the set, displaying five blank lines onscreen.  You can use FOR to enable a command that doesn’t support wildcards to process a pathname specified with wildcards. A classic example of this technique involves the TYPE command. To display multiple files with TYPE, you could enter the following command in a batch file: FOR  %%A  IN   %1   DO  TYPE  %%A  If you specified a pathname that included wildcards as the first parameter to the batch file, TYPE would be executed once for each file that matched the pathname. The only thing wrong with this is that TYPE would display all the files without pausing; so, to see a particular file, you would have to hover over the pause key. Despite this drawback, this example illus- trates how you can use the FOR command to overcome this limitation in a command.

In DOS 5.0 and later versions, if you do not specify  U, FORMAT performs a “safe” for- mat. DOS creates a file containing file information and saves the file to a safe place on disk where the UNFORMAT command can find it if you need to unformat the disk. FORMAT then clears the FAT and root directory of the disk but does not erase any data. Therefore, the UNFORMAT command enables you to restore a disk if you did not intend to format it.   FORMAT 1.0 and later—External  745  5. If you are formatting a hard disk, FORMAT displays the following message:  WARNING, ALL DATA ON NON-REMOVABLE DISK DRIVE d: WILL BE LOST! Proceed with Format  Y N ?  Type Y to format the hard disk or N to abort the formatting operation.  Notes  read.  1. FORMAT now displays numbers with embedded commas, making them much easier to  2. Do not try to format any type of virtual disk; a disk that is part of an ASSIGN, SUBST, or  JOIN command; or a networked or Interlnk disk.  3. Never try to format a RAM disk. Under some circumstances, FORMAT acts erratically  when you use it to format a RAM disk, particularly RAMDRIVE  the DOS RAM disk pro- gram . The responses can range from a Divide overflow message to a lockup of your computer. If the computer locks up, turn off the system and then turn it on again. Obviously, you lose the RAM disk’s contents, but no hard or floppy disks are damaged.  4. In pre-5.0 versions of DOS, FORMAT destroys the information recorded on a floppy or  hard disk. Do not use the command on any disk—floppy or hard—that contains useful information.  5. In DOS 5.0 and later versions, FORMAT performs a safe format. When you use the com-  mand to format a previously formatted disk, DOS copies the FAT and root directory before clearing them and then checks the disk. The existing data is not cleared. If you accidentally format a safely formatted disk, you can unformat the disk. To erase all data from a previously used floppy disk, use the  U switch. An unconditional format takes about 27 percent longer than the default safe format.  6. The  Q switch, another feature of DOS 5.0 and later, enables you to format a disk  quickly. The  Q switch clears the FAT and root directory but does not check the disk for bad sectors. To reuse a disk that you know is good, use the  Q switch. The quick format is nearly 80 percent faster than the default safe format.  7. The 160KB and 180KB disks are known as single-sided, double-density, 5 1 4-inch  disks. The 320KB and 360KB disks are known as double-sided, double-density, 5 1 4-inch disks. The 1.2MB disks are known as double-sided, quadruple or high-density, 5 1 4-inch disks.

GOTO is an unconditional jump and always transfers con- trol whenever the command is encountered.  Syntax  GOTO label  Parameters and Switches  Notes  label  The label that DOS should jump to. label transfers execution to the batch file line following label.  1. To define a label, enter it at the beginning of a line, preceded by a colon  : . Only the first eight characters of a label are significant, although you can enter as many charac- ters as you want without generating an error. All characters on a line past the eighth character of a label are ignored. Spaces are not allowed in labels.  2. When the command GOTO label is executed, DOS jumps to the line following the label and continues executing the batch file. The label can be placed before or after the GOTO statement in the batch file.  3. If a batch file does not contain the label specified by GOTO, the batch file stops and DOS  displays a Label not found error message.  4. Adding a colon as the first character of a line in a batch file effectively “comments out” the line by causing DOS to treat it as a label rather than as a line to be executed. DOS interprets it as a label, however, so using REM is safer.  5. Although GOTO doesn’t generate an error message when you use it from the DOS com- mand line, neither does it serve any purpose. Labels have no meaning on the command line, so the GOTO command has no place to jump to.  “Branching with GOTO” in Chapter 16  See Also  :label and REM  GRAFTABL  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  DISK  Syntax  GRAFTABL codepage   STATUS  GRAFTABL loads into memory the tables of additional character sets to be displayed on the Color Graphics Adapter  CGA .

HIMEM.SYS  device driver   4.0 and later— External  If your computer has more than 1MB of RAM installed, you should load HIMEM.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file. HIMEM.SYS is an XMS v3.0-compatible extended memory manager. Its ser- vices are required in order for DOS to use the extended memory your computer has installed. HIMEM.SYS should be one of the first device drivers loaded with the DEVICE= com- mand in your CONFIG.SYS file.  CONFIG  SYS  DEVICE =  Syntax  For most people, the DEVICE= line that loads HIMEM.SYS can be very simple:  DEVICE=drive:\path\HIMEM.SYS  The full syntax for HIMEM.SYS can seem intimidating, but all the optional parameters have appropriate defaults: DEVICE=drive:\path\HIMEM.SYS   A20CONTROL:onoff   CPUCLOCK:onoff   EISA  HMAMIN=min   INT15=size   NOTEST   NUMHANDLES=num   MACHINE:machcode  SHADOWRAM:onoff   VERBOSE   V  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\   A20CONTROL:onoff  The full path to the HIMEM.SYS file on your system. Setup places the HIMEM.SYS file in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to HIMEM.SYS isn’t specified, DOS looks for the file in the root direc- tory of the startup drive.  The A20 line is the address line that controls access to extended memory, including the high memory area  HMA . Specifying  A20CONTROL:OFF instructs HIMEM.SYS to take control of the A20 line only if it’s off when HIMEM.SYS loads into memory. The default value is  A20CONTROL:ON, which allows HIMEM.SYS to take control of the A20 address line no matter what state it is in. As long as HIMEM.SYS is the first program to access extended memory when you reboot your computer, you should never need this parameter.   HIMEM.SYS  device driver   4.0 and later—External  753   CPUCLOCK:onoff   EISA  On certain computers, HIMEM.SYS may change the CPU clock speed when it loads. If this happens to you, specify the  CPUCLOCK:ON para- meter to prevent HIMEM.SYS from changing the CPU clock speed. The default value is  CPUCLOCK:OFF, which allows HIMEM.SYS to load  a little faster on most computers.  You need to include this parameter only if you have an EISA  Extended Industry Standard Architecture  computer with more than 16MB of RAM installed. Including this parameter allows HIMEM.SYS to control all the available extended memory in such a system.  HIMEM.SYS versions 3.07 through 3.09  v3.09 is distributed with DOS 6  may fail to recog- nize more than 64MB of memory on an EISA computer even with the  EISA parameter specified. If you have this problem, contact Microsoft and ask for document number Q98111 as well as any other available material that can help you get around this limitation.   HMAMIN=min   INT15=size   NOTEST  Only one application can use the HMA at a time. The  HMAMIN=min parameter specifies the minimum amount of RAM  in kilobytes  that an application must request to be granted access to the HMA. Valid values for min are in the range 0 through 63. If this parameter is omitted, a value of 0 is assumed, and the HMA is granted to the first program that requests it.  Normally, you want to load DOS into the HMA to save 43KB of con- ventional memory. However, DOS does not allocate the HMA until after all other device drivers and programs in your CONFIG.SYS file are loaded. To prevent them from allocating the HMA before DOS can get to it, try specifying  HMAMIN=40 in the line that loads HIMEM.SYS.  Certain older applications use the Interrupt 15h interface to allocate extended memory. If you are using a program that requires this type of memory, you can set some aside for it by using the  INT15=size parameter. size is specified in kilobytes and can be any value in the range 64 to 65,535, or the amount of extended memory you have in your system—whichever is lower. Note that you should specify 64KB more than your application requires because the HMA is allo- cated from this memory as well. Any memory you set aside with the  INT15 parameter is unavailable to programs using the standard XMS interface. If you do not specify the  INT15 parameter, no mem- ory is set aside  except the HMA .  This parameter specifies that you do not want HIMEM.SYS to scan extended memory when it loads. Normally, HIMEM.SYS attempts to identify weak and unreliable RAM chips by scanning all extended memory.  App F   754  Appendix F Command Reference   NUMHANDLES=num   MACHINE:machcode  When programs request extended memory, they are given a handle to an extended memory block by HIMEM.SYS. The  NUMHANDLES=num parameter specifies how many handles HIMEM.SYS should have avail- able. num can be any value in the range 1 to 128. If this parameter is omitted, 32 handles will be available. Each handle increases the size of HIMEM in memory by approximately 6 bytes. If the  VERBOSE  or  V  parameter is specified, HIMEM.SYS displays the number of handles available when it finishes loading into memory.  See the message num extended memory handles available in the following “Messages” section.   This parameter is required only if HIMEM.SYS is unable to gain con- trol of the A20 address line for your computer. When this happens, HIMEM.SYS stops loading and displays an error message.  See the mes- sage ERROR: Unable to control A20 line! in the following “Messages” section.  To enable HIMEM.SYS to work with your com- puter, you might have to specify one of the machine codes from the following table. The default value for this parameter is  MACHINE:1 or  MACHINE:AT.  machcode can be the number in the Code column or the abbreviation shown, whichever you find easier to type and remember. Note that more than one computer type can use the same code number.

FASTHP IBM7552 BULLMICRAL DELL  You might have to specify 1 or AT as the machine type for your computer, despite the fact that 1 is the default value for the  MACHINE parameter. HIMEM.SYS tries to determine what type of computer you have when it loads into memory; if it gets confused, it may select the wrong method for controlling the A20 line. In these cases, you might have to explicitly set the machine type to 1.  For the version of HIMEM.SYS that is distributed with DOS 6  v3.09 , the only systems that should require the use of the  MACHINE parame- ter to operate are the Acer 1100  code 6 , the Wyse 12.5MHz 286  code 8 , and the IBM 7552 Industrial Computer  code 15 . Systems that have the same code value as these systems are likely to require this parameter as well.  This parameter is useful only on computer systems with less than 2MB of RAM. On such systems, if HIMEM.SYS detects that the ROM BIOS is running from shadow RAM, it attempts to reclaim that memory and turn it into available XMS memory. If you don’t want HIMEM.SYS to do this, specify the  SHADOWRAM:ON parameter.  Note that specifying  SHADOWRAM:ON allows only the ROM BIOS to continue to run from RAM. HIMEM.SYS cannot set up shadow RAM on a system that doesn’t already have it.  This parameter specifies that HIMEM.SYS should display status mes- sages while it loads. By default, HIMEM.SYS doesn’t display any mes- sages unless an error occurs. You also can turn on the display of messages while HIMEM.SYS is loading by pressing the Alt key.  App F   SHADOWRAM:onoff   VERBOSE   V  This switch is an abbreviated form of the  VERBOSE parameter.   756  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  1. HIMEM.SYS now automatically performs a memory scan to identify RAM chips that are becoming unreliable. An unreliable RAM chip can halt your computer in the middle of a critical operation and could lead to a serious loss of data. If you don’t want HIMEM.SYS to perform this memory scan, include the new  NOTEST switch.  2. HIMEM.SYS requires at least an 80286-based computer with more than 1MB of RAM installed in order to run. Computers with less than 1MB of RAM have no extended memory to manage.  3. You cannot load HIMEM.SYS with a DEVICEHIGH= command. HIMEM.SYS is one of the pro-  grams that enables you to load other device drivers or programs into upper memory with the DEVICEHIGH= or LOADHIGH commands. HIMEM.SYS does attempt to minimize its use of conventional memory; after HIMEM.SYS is loaded, it uses only about 1KB of con- ventional memory.  4. The line that loads HIMEM.SYS should be one of the very first DEVICE= lines in your   CONFIG.SYS file. If any other driver using extended memory is loaded before HIMEM.SYS, the chances are very good that HIMEM.SYS will refuse to load.  5. The DOS 6 Setup program inserts the DEVICE= line, which loads SETVER.EXE before the  line for HIMEM.SYS. This doesn’t cause any problems, but it does prevent you from loading SETVER.EXE into upper memory with the DEVICEHIGH= command. To gain a little conven- tional memory, move the DEVICE= line for SETVER.EXE after the lines that load HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE and change the DEVICE= command into a DEVICEHIGH= command.  6. HIMEM.SYS  or another XMS-compatible memory manager  must be loaded before you  can use any of the following commands or drivers in your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICEHIGH= DOS=HIGH DOS=UMB EMM386.EXE  The DOS=UMB and DEVICEHIGH= commands actually depend on a UMB provider such as EMM386.EXE. Because most UMB providers require the use of XMS memory, however, they all indirectly depend on HIMEM.SYS.  7. If HIMEM.SYS is unable to gain control of the A20 address line, it aborts with an error  message.  See the message ERROR: Unable to control A20 line! in the following “Messages” section.  Unless your computer’s hardware is incompatible, HIMEM.SYS should be able to gain control; its failure to do so usually means that another program is preventing HIMEM.SYS from doing its job. Two programs cannot share control of extend- ed memory, so you have to remove one of them from your CONFIG.SYS file. Check to see whether you are loading any third-party memory managers before the line that loads HIMEM.SYS.  If HIMEM.SYS were loading first, your third-party memory manager would be the one displaying the error message, probably telling you to remove HIMEM.SYS.  If no other memory managers are loading before HIMEM.SYS, it might be baffled by the method used to control the A20 address line in your computer. In these cases, you have to specify a  MACHINE:machcode parameter to tell HIMEM how to control the A20 address   HIMEM.SYS  device driver   4.0 and later—External  757  line. Look for your computer in the table of machine codes.  See the table of machine codes in the preceding “Parameters and Switches” section.  If you find your computer listed, add a  MACHINE:machcode parameter to the line that loads HIMEM.SYS in your  CONFIG.SYS file.  Examples  The first few lines in most people’s CONFIG.SYS files look something like this: DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM MIN=0 DOS=HIGH,UMB  First, HIMEM.SYS is loaded into memory to provide access to the HMA and XMS-compatible memory. Then, EMM386.EXE is loaded, which provides upper memory block  UMB  support for DOS as well as EMS-compatible memory for those programs that use it.  The RAM switch enables UMB and EMS support, and MIN=0 lets EMM386.EXE release back into the memory pool EMS memory that’s not in use.  Finally, DOS is instructed to load itself into the high memory area  HMA  provided by HIMEM.SYS and to establish connections with the UMBs provided by EMM386.EXE.

You can test for three types of conditions with the IF command: the value of an exit code returned by a program, the equivalence of two alphanumeric strings, and the exis- tence of a file or subdirectory.  IF  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  Syntax  To test the exit code returned by a program, use the following form of the IF command: IF NOT  ERRORLEVEL number  command parameters  To compare two alphanumeric strings, use the following form of the IF command: IF NOT  string1==string2  command parameters  To check for the existence of a file or files, use the following form of the IF command: IF NOT  EXIST pathname  command parameters  Parameters and Switches  NOT  Tests for the opposite of the condition. In other words, IF NOT exe- cutes the command if the condition is false.  ERRORLEVEL number Tests the exit code  0 to 255  that a program returns when it termi-  nates. If the exit code is greater than or equal to the number, the condi- tion is true.  string1==string2  Compares two alphanumeric strings to determine whether they are identical. This comparison is case sensitive, so upper- and lowercase  App F   762  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  EXIST pathname  command  characters are not considered equal. The strings can include literals, batch file replaceable parameters  such as %1 , environment variables  such as %COMSPEC% , or any combination of the three.  Tests whether the file specified by pathname exists. If no drive or path is included in pathname, the current drive or directory is assumed. The filename portion is required. Wildcards are allowed in the filename and extension portions of pathname.  Represents the DOS command that is executed if the condition is true  or false if NOT is specified . If you want to run a batch file, use the CALL or COMMAND  C command instead of executing the batch file directly.  parameters  Represents any parameters you want to pass to the command being exe- cuted.  1. For the IF command, if the condition is true, the command is executed. If the condition is  false, DOS skips the command and immediately executes the next line of the batch file. 2. For the IF NOT subcommand, if the condition is false, the command is executed. If the  condition is true, DOS skips the command and immediately executes the next line of the batch file.  3. If you want to run a batch file from the command portion of an IF command, use the CALL or COMMAND  C command instead of executing it directly. Without CALL or COMMAND  C, control never returns to your batch file.  4. IF commands can be nested. That is, you can use the IF command in the command por- tion of an IF command. This can be a handy way to test for a range of exit code values, freeing you from the tyranny of descending order IF ERRORLEVEL statements.  See the following “Examples” section.   5. Do not attempt to use the “at” sign  @  to suppress the display of the command specified in the command portion of an IF command. DOS will not interpret the @ correctly and will search for an executable file that begins with an “at” sign. To accomplish the same thing, enter ECHO OFF before executing the IF statement.  6. IF ERRORLEVEL number returns true if the number you specified is less than or equal to the exit code returned by the previous program. For this reason, IF ERRORLEVEL com- mands usually have to be arranged in descending order to get the desired results. You must test for this value immediately after the program terminates. Executing any other command, even if it doesn’t return an exit code, may clear the previous exit code from memory.  7. Not all programs return exit codes. If a program doesn’t return an exit code, an IF  ERRORLEVEL 0 command evaluates to true, but any other number causes the IF state- ment to be false. Presently, no DOS internal commands return exit codes, and,    unfortunately, you can’t set the exit code for a batch file either. The following DOS external commands return exit codes:  IF 2.0 and later—Internal  763  BACKUP CHKDSK CHOICE DEFRAG DELTREE DISKCOMP  DISKCOPY FIND FORMAT GRAFTABL KEYB MOVE  MSAV REPLACE RESTORE SCANDISK SETVER XCOPY  8. If you use CALL to call a program that returns an exit code, that exit code value is avail-  able after CALL returns. Unfortunately, you can’t set the exit code for a batch file, so CALL can’t return an exit code from a batch file you have executed. To return status information from a batch file executed with the CALL command, create an environment variable and set it equal to your return status. Then, you can test this environment vari- able in the calling batch file.  9. For string1==string2, DOS makes a literal, character-by-character comparison of the two strings. Neither string can contain embedded spaces or equal signs. If you want to include a percent sign  %  in either string, include it twice if this IF command is execut- ed from a batch file. The comparison IF performs is case sensitive; that is, uppercase and lowercase characters are considered to be different.  10. When you include environment variables  such as %COMSPEC%  or replaceable parameters  such as %0 through %9  in either string argument in a batch file, they are replaced with the value of the environment variable or replaceable parameter when DOS parses the line. DOS does not parse commands you enter at the DOS prompt, so you can’t include either type of variable in a command that you execute from the DOS prompt.  11. When IF is performing string1==string2 comparisons, each string must have at least one character in it; otherwise, a syntax error will result, and DOS will abort the batch file. In DOS 6 and later, string2 can be empty without causing an error. This problem often happens in IF statements that test replaceable parameters or environment vari- ables and typically is solved by adding dummy characters to both strings. For instance, test %1x==ERNIEx or “%1”==”ERNIE” instead of %1==ERNIE.  12. Including only one equal sign in an IF string comparison results in a syntax error.  Interestingly enough, you can use more than two equal signs without causing an error. 13. The EXIST pathname form of the IF command returns true if at least one file matches the pathname specified. If an invalid subdirectory or drive is specified, the condition is false. DOS does not search the DOS PATH for pathname; DOS searches only the drive and subdirectory specified. If pathname is omitted, DOS searches the current drive and directory.  14. Although the EXIST pathname form of the IF command is intended to test for the exis- tence of files, you can use it to test for the existence of a subdirectory by specifying the NUL device as the filename. The NUL device  or any other valid DOS device  exists in every subdirectory; so if the specified subdirectory exists, the IF EXIST path\NUL com- mand is true.  App F   764  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  Notice that because of the way the IF ERRORLEVEL command works—testing whether an exit code is greater than or equal to the number specified—the following statement always exe- cutes the GOTO statement: IF  ERRORLEVEL  0  GOTO  ALWAYS_JUMP  When you’re testing an ERRORLEVEL number, be sure to test for the highest possible number first. Consider the following example: IF  ERRORLEVEL  1  GOTO  ONE_OR_GREATER  IF  ERRORLEVEL  2  GOTO  TWO_OR_GREATER  The preceding example always goes to ONE_OR_GREATER, even if an ERRORLEVEL of 2 is returned because 2 is greater than or equal to 1. Make sure that when you use IF  ERRORLEVEL commands, you include them in descending order.  You can get around the limitation just noted by nesting IF ERRORLEVEL commands, checking for ranges of values with upper and lower bounds. Test for the lowest value; then test for NOT the highest value plus one in an embedded IF command. For example, consider the follow- ing IF commands: IF  ERRORLEVEL  1  IF  NOT  ERRORLEVEL  4  GOTO  ONE_TO_THREE  In English, if the exit code returned by the program is greater than or equal to the first value  1  and less than the second value  not greater than or equal to 4 , execute the com- mand. Notice that this form of the IF ERRORLEVEL command executes the proper GOTO com- mand, no matter what order they are executed in. To test for a single value, simply embed a negative test for one more than the value you want, like this: IF  ERRORLEVEL  2  IF  NOT  ERRORLEVEL  3  GOTO  ONLY_TWO  IF string comparisons are often used to make sure that at least one parameter is specified when the batch file is executed, as shown in these examples: IF  “%1”==””  GOTO  HELP_MESSAGE  IF  “%1”==” ?”  GOTO  HELP_MESSAGE  If no parameters to the batch file are specified, the first IF condition is true, and the GOTO command jumps to a section of the batch file where you can display a help message. The second IF statement tests for the  ? help switch, enabling this batch file to honor a request for help from the user as well.  Sometimes this technique is combined with the SHIFT command to enable a batch file to loop through a variable number of parameters, as shown in the following: :LOOP IF  “%1”==””  GOTO  END TYPE  %1    MORE SHIFT GOTO  LOOP  :END   INCLUDE= 6.0 and later—Internal  765  You could specify as many text files as you wanted to when executing this batch file, and the TYPE command would display each one in turn. After the last file had been displayed, the IF command would execute the GOTO END command, and the batch file would terminate. When you combine IF and GOTO in this way, you can create a multiline loop in a batch file.  To jump around part of a batch file if the network menu choice was not chosen from a DOS 6.0 startup menu, use the following line: IF  NOT  “%CONFIG%”==”NETWORK”  GOTO  FINISH  Notice that in all the preceding examples, quotation marks are used to ensure that the string comparisons never try to evaluate a null string. For example, in the preceding command, if the CONFIG environment variable turns out to be undefined, DOS evaluates the following statement after the parser makes substitutions: IF NOT “”==”NETWORK” GOTO FINISH  Without the quotation marks, one side of the comparison would be empty, and the batch file would be aborted with a syntax error message. With the quotation marks included, DOS simply finds “” not equal to “NETWORK”.  Suppose that you want to copy all the .DOC files in your C:\WORK subdirectory to a backup disk. You could use the IF EXIST command, as follows, to make sure that at least one .DOC file existed before executing the COPY command: IF  EXIST  C:\WORK\*.DOC  COPY  C:\WORK\*.DOC  A:  The IF EXIST command can be used to check for the existence of a subdirectory if you spec- ify the NUL device as the filename. You can use this technique to create a subdirectory if it doesn’t already exist: IF  NOT  EXIST  C:\WORK\NUL  MD  C:\WORK  By nesting IF EXIST commands, you also can check to make sure that a file doesn’t exist: IF  EXIST  C:\WORK\NUL  IF  NOT  EXIST  C:\WORK\MYFILE.TXT  GOTO  NOFILE  Notice that simply checking for the file with IF NOT EXIST can return true if the subdirecto- ry or drive is invalid, which might lead to errors later in your batch file. By testing for the existence of the path and then checking that the file doesn’t exist, you can be sure that creat- ing MYFILE.TXT in the C:\WORK subdirectory will succeed without overwriting another file.  See Also  :label, %envir%, %n, and GOTO  “Using the IF Command” in Chapter 16  CONFIG  SYS  INCLUDE=  6.0 and later—Internal After you set up a startup menu, you might find that in certain configuration blocks, you are entering the same commands over and over. Instead of retyping them, you can gather them all together in a block of their own and use the INCLUDE= command to include that block  App F   766  Appendix F Command Reference  within the others. The [COMMON] block performs a similar function for commands that you want to include in all your configuration blocks. INCLUDE= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  INCLUDE=blockname  Parameters and Switches  blockname  Notes  The name of the configuration block that you want to include when the active configuration block is processed. blockname must match a configura- tion block you have defined elsewhere in your CONFIG.SYS file, and it also can contain INCLUDE= commands. This argument is required.  1. The INCLUDE= command can appear only inside configuration blocks in CONFIG.SYS and can refer only to another configuration block. You cannot use INCLUDE= to include the selections from one menu block within another.  2. CONFIG.SYS allows two types of blocks: menu blocks and configuration blocks. Each block begins with a [blockname] and includes all the lines that follow up to the next [blockname]. Menu blocks, which are blocks named [MENU] or defined with a SUBMENU= command, can include only menu-related commands. All other CONFIG.SYS commands belong in configuration blocks. The [COMMON] block is a special kind of configuration block, and certain special rules apply to it. It is the only block name that you can have more than once in your  CONFIG.SYS file. All commands included in a [COMMON] block are always executed. Any commands in CONFIG.SYS that are not included in any block  that is, they appear before the first [blockname]  are assumed to be in a [COMMON] block. [COMMON] blocks are an alternative to using the INCLUDE= command. If you are using INCLUDE= to include a single block of commands in all your configuration blocks, con- sider using a [COMMON] block instead.  3. You are allowed to nest INCLUDE= commands. That is, a block included with the  INCLUDE= command can have another INCLUDE= command within it. Although there is no clear limit to how deep this nesting can go, for the sake of clarity, you should limit yourself to no more than one or two levels of INCLUDE= commands.  Because nesting is allowed, there is the possibility of creating an endless loop. Make sure that an included block never includes any block that included it  that is, A includes B, which includes A .   INCLUDE= 6.0 and later—Internal  767  4. The INCLUDE command is meant to help you eliminate repetition in your CONFIG.SYS file. Its use, however, often makes your CONFIG.SYS file harder to understand. Weigh these factors carefully when you decide whether to use an INCLUDE block. When soft- ware you are installing makes a mess of your menu system, a clear, simple CONFIG.SYS file is easier to repair than a complicated one.  Examples  The following sample CONFIG.SYS file illustrates the use of INCLUDE= blocks and [COMMON] blocks: [MENU] MENUITEM=MINIMUM, Minimal Configuration MENUITEM=NORMAL, Normal Configuration  Default  MENUITEM=NORM_EMS, Normal Configuration with EMS Available MENUITEM=MAXIMUM, All the Bells and Whistles MENUDEFAULT=NORMAL, 30  [COMMON] DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS DOS=HIGH BREAK=ON NUMLOCK=OFF  [MINIMUM] BUFFERS=30 LASTDRIVE=H STACKS=9,256  [NORMAL] INCLUDE=MINIMUM DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS DOS=UMB  [NORM_EMS] INCLUDE=MINIMUM DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM DOS=UMB  [MAXIMUM] INCLUDE=NORM_EMS DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS 1450 512 224  E DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS  [COMMON] SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\  P  E:512  App F  Notice that the MAXIMUM configuration includes the NORM_EMS configuration, which in turn includes the MINIMUM configuration. All the configuration choices automatically “include” the commands in the two COMMON blocks. As you can see, this kind of nesting can quickly become confusing. Don’t use this example as a model for your own CONFIG.SYS file; it is only meant to illustrate the use of the INCLUDE= command and is much more complicated than it needs to be.   768  Appendix F Command Reference  As it turns out, all the commands in the MINIMUM block could be placed in the COMMON block preceding it, leaving the MINIMUM block empty.  No matter what configuration you choose, the MINIMUM block is included.  However, if you removed the MINIMUM block completely, the corresponding menu line would not be displayed, and you would need to remove the INCLUDE=MINIMUM commands from the other blocks as well.  See Also  [blockname] and MENUITEM=  “Creating Multiple Configurations” in Chapter 2  INSTALL=  CONFIG  SYS  4.0 and later—Internal  INSTALL= can load resident software  TSRs  from your CONFIG.SYS file into conventional memory. Programs loaded with INSTALL= are executed after all other CONFIG.SYS lines have been processed and just before the command-line interpreter  COMMAND.COM  is loaded into memory. INSTALL= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  INSTALL=drive:\path\filename parameters  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  Although this parameter is optional, you should always include the full drive and path to the resident program file. If they are omitted, the file is assumed to be in the root directory of the startup drive.  The full filename, with extension, of the resident program to be loaded. No extension is assumed, and wildcards are not allowed. This parameter is required.  Any parameters that the resident program requires are included after its name. DOS passes these parameters directly to the program when it’s loaded into memory. For more information, see the instructions for load- ing the resident program.  filename  parameters  Notes  1. If MS-DOS cannot find the program file you have specified, it displays a Bad or   missing filename message and continues processing CONFIG.SYS.  See the first item  in the following “Messages” section.   2. Resident programs included with DOS that can be safely loaded with the INSTALL=  command include FASTOPEN.EXE, KEYB.COM, NLSFUNC.EXE, and SHARE.EXE.  3. In versions of DOS earlier than DOS 6, many resident programs could not be loaded with INSTALL= because no environment was available to them. Starting with DOS 6, an environment is available to installed programs, and most resident software can now be successfully loaded this way.   INSTALLHIGH  see HIINSTALL   769  4. With DOS 6, there is little reason to use INSTALL= anymore. In the past, one of the  main reasons to use INSTALL= was to save the small amount of memory wasted on envi- ronments for resident software. But with DOS 6, you save little or nothing. Also, INSTALL= is limited to loading software into conventional memory, and you can’t include LOADHIGH in an INSTALL= command to get around this limitation. All in all, you usually are better off avoiding INSTALL= entirely; instead, load your resident software from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  5. DOS executes all other lines in CONFIG.SYS, including any SET commands, before exe- cuting any INSTALL= lines. When all the INSTALL= lines have been processed, the com- mand interpreter  COMMAND.COM  is loaded and begins to process your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 6. Only resident software should be loaded with an INSTALL= command. DOS waits until  the program terminates before continuing, and if a normal program is run, neither  COMMAND.COM nor your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is loaded until you quit the program. Although this setup might be interesting, it could make your system very unstable and should be avoided.  Examples  To load SHARE.EXE from your CONFIG.SYS file, you would include the following line: INCLUDE=C:\DOS\SHARE.EXE   L:50  This line assumes that SHARE.EXE is located in the C:\DOS subdirectory and sets the number of file locks to 50. For DOS to find SHARE.EXE, the file extension must always be included with the filename because no default extensions are assumed with INSTALL=.  Messages  Bad or missing filename Error in CONFIG.SYS line number  Warning: DOS displays this message if it can’t find the file you specified in a DEVICE=, DEVICEHIGH=, or INSTALL= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. filename is the name of the file that DOS was looking for, and number is the line in CONFIG.SYS where the command is locat- ed. Edit the line so that the path and filename are correct and then restart your computer.

If the connection to the server hasn’t been established, INTERLNK attempts  to connect with the server, using the parameters you specified when you loaded the INTERLNK.EXE device driver. Before you can run INTERLNK from the DOS command line, you must load the INTERLNK.EXE device driver into memory by adding a DEVICE= statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  INTERLNK client:=server:  ...  Parameters and Switches  client:  server:  The client drive letter that you want to use to access a disk drive on the Interlnk server. client: must be one of the drive letters that the INTERLNK.EXE device dri- ver reserved when it loaded into memory. The trailing colon is optional.  The server drive that you want client: to refer to. server: must be a drive on the Interlnk server that is available for redirection. The trailing colon is option- al. If this parameter is omitted, the client: drive letter is disconnected from the Interlnk server.  Notes  1. The INTERLNK.EXE device driver must be installed before you can run INTERLNK from the  command line. If you try to run INTERLNK without installing the device driver, an error message is displayed.  See the following “Messages” section.   2. INTERLNK.EXE actually is two files: a device driver and an executable program. The  device driver portion does all the real work and has to be loaded into memory with a DEVICE= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. After this device driver has been loaded into memory, the executable portion of the file communicates with the device driver to reas- sign drive letters and display status information.  3. To display Interlnk’s status, type INTERLNK at the DOS prompt. Interlnk displays a list of client drive letters on the left, with the server drives they are connected to on the right. If any of the server drives have volume labels, they are displayed as well.  4. You can include as many client:=server: parameters as you need in a single INTERLNK  command. Separate each client:=server: assignment with spaces.  5. To disconnect an Interlnk drive, specify the client:= parameter but omit the server: drive letter. A disconnected client: drive letter is immediately available for use con- necting to another server drive. You can perform a mixture of drive assignments and disconnections in a single INTERLNK command by separating each one with spaces.   INTERLNK 6.0 and later—External  771  6. The drives that INTERLNK.EXE reserves when it loads into memory are private; they can’t  be used by other programs even if Interlnk isn’t using them. For example, you cannot use an inactive Interlnk drive letter as a network drive or a SUBST alias. INTERLNK.EXE displays the drive letters it has reserved when it is loading into memory.  7. To use a printer on an Interlnk server from within Windows, you first have to access  the Printer dialog box in Control Panel. Next, click the Connect button. In the Connect dialog box, either clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box, or specify the port as LPT1.DOS or LPT2.DOS rather than LPT1 or LPT2. Normally, Windows prints directly to the hardware and bypasses Interlnk’s printer redirection. However, when you disable Fast Printing or print to a filename rather than the port name, Windows prints through DOS, and Interlnk can redirect the data to the server’s printer port.  8. All disk drives redirected by Interlnk are considered removable drives because the con- nection to them can be lost at any time. DoubleSpace refers to Interlnk drives as nor- mal, removable local drives. MSD reports that Interlnk drives are floppy drives with one cylinder. SMARTDrive defaults to read-caching Interlnk drives, as it does with local floppy disk drives. Windows File Manager represents Interlnk drives with a “flop- py icon.”  9. An Interlnk client cannot access CD-ROM drives on the server. Interlnk can recognize only standard DOS drives, not network drives. CD-ROM drives use the network inter- face, so Interlnk cannot be used to give the client computer access to CD-ROM drives on the server.  10. Redirected Interlnk drives do not support disk-level operations, and the following DOS  commands should not be used on redirected drives:  CHKDSK DEFRAG DEBUG DISKCOMP DISKCOPY FDISK  FORMAT MIRROR SCANDISK SYS UNDELETE UNFORMAT  Third-party utilities that require low-level disk access also should be avoided.  11. To be able to run, INTERLNK requires DOS 3.0 or later. You can run different versions of DOS on the client and server computers, although the limitations of each version must be respected. For example, disk partitions greater than 32MB on an Interlnk server are not accessible on an Interlnk client running DOS 3.0.  The Microsoft MS-DOS 6 license agreement requires at least one of the two computers involved to be running a licensed copy of MS-DOS 6.   12. An appropriate cable is required to connect two computers with Interlnk. If you are  using serial ports for the Interlnk connection, a 3-wire or 7-wire null-modem serial cable is required. If you are using parallel ports, an 11-wire parallel cable is required. These cables often are referred to as LapLink cables, in honor of the product that popularized this simple type of network. Check the two computers to see what type of connectors  App F   772  Appendix F Command Reference  you need. Microsoft includes detailed wiring charts for these cables in the entry for INTERLNK in the DOS 6 online help system  that is, type HELP INTERLNK at the DOS prompt and click the Notes entry .  Examples  Assuming that Interlnk is running and you have successfully connected with the server, redi- rect the client drive letter D: to access drive C: on the server by entering the following com- mand. INTERLNK  D=C  Notice that you are not required to enter colons with the drive letters, although colons are acceptable.  To break the relationship  cancel the redirection  between the client’s D drive and the server drive, enter this command: INTERLNK  D=  You can make more than one assignment in a single command by separating them with spaces like this: INTERLNK  D=A  E=B  F=C  This command would connect you to three server drives. Drive D on the client computer would refer to drive A on the server, drive E to drive B on the server, and drive F to drive C on the server.  If you ever get lost and want to see what assignments you have, type the INTERLNK command with no parameters as follows: INTERLNK  INTERLNK displays a status screen that looks something like this: This Computer        Other Computer   Client                Server   ------------   -----------------------  D:    equals    A: E:    equals    B: F:    equals    C:  120Mb   CONNER 120 LPT2: equals    LPT1:  This screen reflects the assignments made earlier with the INTERLNK D=A E=B F=C command. You can’t control the assignment of printer ports from the command line, but the display does show you what drive assignments Interlnk has made. To print to the server’s printer, you would print to LPT2 on the client computer.  Interlnk shows the size of any server hard drives in parentheses after the drive letter in the right column. Notice that if any of the server drives have volume labels, they’re displayed as well  CONNER 120 is the volume label for the server’s C: drive in the example . Volume labels can make a confusing assignment display a bit easier to understand.

Before you try to establish this connection from the client computer, make sure that the cable is connected at both ends and that INTERSVR is running on the server computer. Drive assignment syntax error.  Error: You have made a syntax error while attempting to assign drive letters to remote drives on the Interlnk server. This message is often caused by trying to assign drive letters that weren’t reserved by INTERLNK.EXE. The only drive letters you can use to access drives on the Interlnk server are the ones that INTERLNK.EXE displays when it is loaded into memory from your CONFIG.SYS file. Driver NOT installed To install Interlnk, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file and reboot:  DEVICE=drive:\path\INTERLNK.EXE  Information: You have attempted to run the INTERLNK program without first installing the INTERLNK.EXE device driver. drive:\path\ in the preceding message reflects the current loca- tion of INTERLNK.EXE on your system. You can run INTERLNK from the command line only when the client device driver is in memory, so you must load INTERLNK.EXE from your CON- FIG.SYS file before you can access the executable portion of the program. Invalid unit reading drive drive Abort, Retry, Fail  Error: You’ve tried to access an Interlnk drive that isn’t assigned to a drive on the Interlnk server. Press A to abort, R to Retry, and F to Fail. The safest choice is to fail the operation by pressing F. In most cases, Retry simply redisplays the error message. After you clear the error message, you can assign this drive letter to a server drive by using the INTERLNK client:=server: command. Not ready reading drive drive Abort, Retry, Fail  Error: You have tried to access an Interlnk drive  or another reserved drive letter , but the connection to the Interlnk server hasn’t been made yet.

Somehow, you have ended up with two different copies of INTERLNK.EXE on your disk. Locate the newer copy of INTERLNK.EXE and make sure that you are loading that copy in your CONFIG.SYS file. You might want to remove the old copy of INTERLNK.EXE from your disk so that you do not run it by accident.   774  Appendix F Command Reference  See Also  INTERLNK.EXE and INTERSVR  “Using Interlnk to Share Another Computer’s Resources” in Chapter 8  CONFIG  SYS  DEVICE =  INTERLNK.EXE  device driver   6.0 and later— External  The INTERLNK.EXE device driver establishes a link by way of a serial or parallel cable with another computer that is running the INTERSVR program. INTERLNK.EXE provides the client side of this relationship and usually is installed on a laptop computer  the client  from which you want to access files or printers on a desktop computer  the server . INTERLNK.EXE must be loaded in a DEVICE= statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  DEVICE=drive:\path\INTERLNK.EXE  DRIVES:num  NOPRINTER   COM  COM:num  COM:addr  LPT   LPT:num  LPT:addr  AUTO   NOSCAN   LOW  BAUD:rate  V  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  The full path to the INTERLNK.EXE file on your system. Setup places the INTERLNK.EXE file in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to INTERLNK.EXE isn’t specified, DOS looks for the file in the root directory of the startup drive.  The number of drive letters to reserve for redirected drives on the client computer. Num can be any value from 0 to the number of drive letters still available when INTERLNK.EXE is loaded.  DOS can allocate 26 drive letters, from A to Z.  If this parameter is omitted, 3 drive letters are reserved. Specifying  DRIVES:0 disables drive redirection, and only printers are redi- rected.  This parameter specifies that no printers should be redirected. Normally, Interlnk redirects all available printers. Specifying this parameter can reduce the size of INTERLNK.EXE in memory.  This parameter specifies that Interlnk should scan all serial ports when it’s looking for a connection with the server. This is the default setting. If you have a serial mouse, you might want to use a  COM:num or  LPT:num para- meter to specify the port that Interlnk should use.  The serial port  by DOS number  that Interlnk should use to connect with the server. This parameter can be entered as  COM:1 or as  COM1; the colon is optional. Typical values are  COM1,  COM2,  COM3, and  COM4.   DRIVES:num   NOPRINTER   COM   COM:num   INTERLNK.EXE  device driver  6.0 and later—External  775   COM:addr   LPT   LPT:num   LPT:addr   AUTO   NOSCAN   LOW   BAUD:rate   V  The serial port  by hexadecimal port address  that Interlnk should use to connect with the server. Typical addresses for serial ports are 3F8 and 2F8. Unless you have a particular reason to specify the serial port by address, you should use the more familiar port numbers.  This parameter specifies that Interlnk should scan all parallel ports when it’s looking for a connection with the server. This is the default setting.  The parallel port  by DOS number  that Interlnk should use to connect with the server. This parameter can be entered as  LPT:1 or as  LPT1; the colon is optional. Typical values are  LPT1,  LPT2, and  LPT3. This para- meter has nothing to do with redirected printers. It specifies the port being used to connect the two computers together.  The parallel port  by hexadecimal port address  that Interlnk should use to connect with the server. Typical addresses for parallel ports are 3BC, 378, and 278. Unless you have a particular reason to specify the parallel port by address, you should use the more familiar port numbers instead.  Specifying this parameter instructs INTERLNK.EXE not to remain in memo- ry if the server is unavailable. By using this parameter, you can leave in your CONFIG.SYS file the DEVICE= line that loads INTERLNK.EXE. With  AUTO specified, Interlnk loads into memory only if you are connected to a serv- er when you start up your computer.  Specifying this parameter stops INTERLNK.EXE from trying to establish a connection with the server when INTERLNK.EXE loads into memory. You have to establish the connection later by running INTERLNK from the DOS command line.  If upper memory is available, INTERLNK.EXE normally tries to load itself high. If you want to make sure that INTERLNK.EXE loads into conventional memory instead, specify the  LOW parameter.  The maximum baud rate you want Interlnk to use for serial communica- tions. rate can be one of the following values: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200. If no maximum rate is specified, 115200 is assumed.  Note that rate limits only the maximum data transfer rate that can be used between the client and server for a serial connection. If you are using a parallel connection, the  BAUD:rate parameter has no effect.  If either the client or the server computer freezes while accessing Interlnk drives, try specifying the  V parameter on one or both computers. This parameter attempts to correct problems that arise from conflicts with the system timers on connected computers.  App F   776  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  1. The INTERLNK.EXE device driver must be installed before you can run INTERLNK from the  command line. If you try to run INTERLNK without installing the device driver, an error message is displayed.  See the first item in the following “Messages” section.   When Interlnk scans serial ports looking for a server connection, it interferes with the operation of any mouse drivers that are servicing those ports. If your mouse is attached to a serial port, be sure to use a  COM:num or  LPT:num parameter to specify the port that Interlnk should use.  2. INTERLNK.EXE actually is two files: a device driver and an executable program. The  device driver portion does all the real work and has to be loaded into memory with a DEVICE= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. After this device driver is loaded into mem- ory, the executable portion of the file communicates with the device driver to reassign drive letters and display status information.  3. If you regularly use Interlnk to connect your laptop to a desktop computer, make sure  that you specify the  AUTO parameter. Then, when you’re on the road, INTERLNK.EXE will fail to find the server and not waste memory by loading anyway. Whenever you want to use Interlnk, simply connect the cable to a server and reboot the laptop.  4. INTERLNK.EXE automatically loads into upper memory if it’s available. You don’t need to  use the DEVICEHIGH= command with INTERLNK.EXE.  5. By default, all the client’s serial ports and then all the client’s parallel ports are scanned  when Interlnk looks for a connection with the server. As soon as the server is found, scanning stops. If  COM is specified without  LPT, only the client’s serial ports are scanned. Similarly, if  LPT is specified without  COM, only the client’s parallel ports are scanned. Interlnk’s default behavior is equivalent to specifying both the  COM and  LPT parameters.  6. Under normal circumstances, INTERLNK.EXE requires about 15KB of memory. You  can decrease this amount by specifying certain parameters. When you specify the  NOPRINTER parameter, Interlnk does not load the routines required to redirect printer output. If you specify the  DRIVES:0 parameter, Interlnk does not load the routines required to redirect disk drives. If you specify either the  COM or  LPT parameter  but not both , Interlnk does not load the routines required to access the type of port you are not using. Depending on what combination of Interlnk services you need, you might be able to slim Interlnk’s memory use significantly.  7. The drives that INTERLNK.EXE reserves when it loads into memory are private and can’t be claimed by other programs even if Interlnk isn’t using them. For example, you can- not use an inactive Interlnk drive letter as a network drive or a SUBST alias.  8. If INTERLNK.EXE fails to connect with a server when it loads or the  NOSCAN parameter  prevents it from connecting, the drives it reserves will be empty. To establish a connec- tion with the server, you have to run INTERLNK from the command line and redirect the server drives manually.   INTERLNK.EXE  device driver  6.0 and later—External  777  9. Because INTERLNK.EXE allocates drive letters, you should be very careful about where you locate it in your CONFIG.SYS file. In most cases, you will want to load INTERLNK.EXE last so that any drives it allocates leave other drive assignments in CONFIG.SYS unchanged.  Having your drive letters change simply because you added a device driver to your  CONFIG.SYS file can be painful. Often, you have to edit batch files to reflect the new drive letters. All references to drives that have changed have to be corrected in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Microsoft Windows is very sensitive to drive- letter changes, and some Windows’ applications fail if they are suddenly located on a different drive.  Before you add or rearrange DEVICE= lines in your CONFIG.SYS file, think through the changes you may be making to drive-letter assignments and the impact the changes will have on your system. If you are careful, you can often accomplish your task without changing any drive-letter assignments, or at least keep the changes to a minimum. Doing so can save you a great deal of work.  10. If you use DoubleSpace, always load the DBLSPACE.SYS driver before you load  INTERLNK.EXE. If you load INTERLNK.EXE first, the DoubleSpace host  uncompressed  drives may become unavailable on the client computer.  11. To use a printer on an Interlnk server from within Windows, you first have to access  the Printer dialog box in Control Panel. Next, click the Connect button. In the Connect dialog box, either clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box, or specify the port as LPT1.DOS or LPT2.DOS rather than LPT1 or LPT2. Normally, Windows prints directly to the hardware and bypasses Interlnk’s printer redirection. However, when you disable Fast Printing or print to a filename instead of the port name, Windows prints through DOS, and Interlnk can redirect the data to the server’s printer port.  12. All disk drives redirected by Interlnk are considered removable drives because the con-  nection to them can be lost at any time. DoubleSpace refers to Interlnk drives as normal, removable local drives. MSD reports that Interlnk drives are floppy drives with one cylin- der. SMARTDrive defaults to read-caching Interlnk drives, as it does with local floppy disk drives. Windows File Manager represents Interlnk drives with a “floppy icon.”  13. An Interlnk client cannot access CD-ROM drives on the server. Interlnk can recognize  only standard DOS drives, not network drives. Because CD-ROM drives use the net- work interface, Interlnk cannot be used to give the client computer access to CD-ROM drives on the server.  14. Redirected Interlnk drives do not support disk-level operations, and the following DOS  commands should not be used on redirected drives:  App F  CHKDSK DEFRAG DEBUG DISKCOMP DISKCOPY FDISK  FORMAT MIRROR SCANDISK SYS UNDELETE UNFORMAT  Third-party utilities that require low-level disk access also should be avoided.   778  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  15. INTERLNK.EXE requires DOS 3.0 or later to run. You can run different versions of DOS  on the client and server computers, although the limitations of each version must be respected. For example, disk partitions greater than 32MB on an Interlnk server are not accessible on an Interlnk client running DOS 3.0.  The Microsoft MS-DOS 6 license agreement requires at least one of the two computers involved to be running a licensed copy of MS-DOS 6.   16. An appropriate cable is required to connect two computers with Interlnk. If you are using serial ports for the Interlnk connection, a 3-wire or 7-wire null-modem serial cable is required. If you are using parallel ports, an 11-wire parallel cable is required. These cables often are referred to as LapLink cables, in honor of the product that pop- ularized this simple type of network. Check the two computers to see what type of con- nectors you need. Microsoft includes detailed wiring charts for these cables in the entry for INTERLNK in the DOS 6 online help system  that is, type HELP INTERLNK at the DOS prompt and click the Notes entry .  A typical line that loads INTERLNK.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS file of your Laptop computer might look like this: DEVICE=C:\DOS\INTERLNK.EXE   COM2   AUTO  As long as the connection with the Interlnk server is established  on COM2 , the Interlnk client device driver will load into memory and reserve three drive letters  the default is three  with which it can access drives on the server. Any printers attached to the server will be available on the client computer as well. Because of the  AUTO parameter, if INTERSVR isn’t running on the server when this DEVICE= line is executed, INTERLNK.EXE won’t load into memory.  If memory is tight, and you don’t need access to more than one disk drive or any printers on the Interlnk server, you could add the  NOPRINTER parameter, like this: DEVICE=C:\DOS\INTERLNK.EXE   COM2   AUTO   DRIVES:1   NOPRINTER  Note that in both of the preceding examples, INTERLNK.EXE loads into upper memory if it’s available. To force INTERLNK.EXE to load into conventional memory, specify the  LOW para- meter, as in the following: DEVICE=C:\DOS\INTERLNK.EXE   COM2   AUTO   LOW  If you used a parallel cable to connect the two computers instead of a serial cable, you would specify a parallel port rather than a serial port: DEVICE=C:\DOS\INTERLNK.EXE   LPT1   AUTO  Note that you must use the same type of port on both computers. You can’t use a serial port on one computer and a parallel port on the other. The cables you need aren’t interchange- able, either.  After INTERLNK.EXE has successfully established a connection with the Interlnk server, it automatically assigns the drive letters it has reserved to disk drives on the Interlnk server. To see what assignments have been made, run INTERLNK from the DOS command line.

By default, all drives are available for redirection.  Specifies the letter of a drive that will not be redirected. The ellipsis  ...  indicates that more than one drive can be excluded by a single INTERSVR command. By default, no drives are excluded.  Specifies that INTERSVR should scan all serial ports when it’s looking for a connection with the client. This is the default setting. If you have a seri- al mouse, you might want to use a  COM:num or  LPT:num parameter to specify the port Interlnk should use.  Indicates the serial port  by DOS number  that INTERSVR should use to connect with the client. This parameter can be entered as  COM:1 or as  COM1; the colon is optional. Typical values are  COM1,  COM2,  COM3, and  COM4.  Indicates the serial port  by hexadecimal port address  that INTERSVR should use to connect with the client. Typical addresses for serial ports are 3F8 and 2F8. Unless you have a particular reason to specify the seri- al port by address, you should use the more familiar port numbers instead.

Note that this parameter has nothing to do with redirected printers; it specifies the port being used to connect the two computers together.  Indicates the parallel port  by hexadecimal port address  that INTERSVR should use to connect with the client. Typical addresses for parallel ports are 3BC, 378, and 278. Unless you have a particular reason to specify the parallel port by address, you should use the more familiar port num- bers instead.  Indicates the maximum baud rate you want Interlnk to use for serial communications. rate can be one of the following values: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200. If no maximum rate is specified, 115200 is assumed.  rate limits only the maximum data transfer rate that can be used between the client and server for a serial connection. If you are using  a parallel connection, the  BAUD:rate parameter has no effect.  If either the client or server computer freezes while accessing Interlnk drives, try specifying the  V parameter on one or both computers. This parameter attempts to correct problems that arise from conflicts with the system timers on connected computers.  Forces the use of a color scheme appropriate for a black-and-white  monochrome  monitor or LCD display.  Copies the Interlnk files INTERLNK.EXE and INTERSVR.EXE to another computer. If your laptop computer doesn’t have a floppy disk drive, use this parameter to set up an Interlnk connection. The two computers must be connected by a 7-wire, null-modem serial cable  sometimes referred to as a LapLink cable . The MODE command must be available on the target computer for this transfer to work. You can’t specify any other parameters when you’re using the  RCOPY feature.  Notes  1. When INTERSVR scans serial ports looking for a client connection, it interferes with the operation of any mouse drivers that are servicing those ports. If your mouse is attached to a serial port, be sure to use a  COM:num or  LPT:num parameter to specify the port that Interlnk should use.   INTERSVR 6.0 and later—External  783  2. By default, all the server’s serial ports and then all the server’s parallel ports are scanned when Interlnk searches for a connection with the client computer. As soon as the client is found, scanning stops. If  COM is specified without  LPT, only the server’s serial ports are scanned. Similarly, if  LPT is specified without  COM, only the server’s parallel ports are scanned. INTERSVR’s default behavior is equivalent to specifying both the  COM and  LPT parameters.  3. INTERSVR is unable to make network or CD-ROM drives available to the client comput- er. Network and CD-ROM drives are not considered local drives because DOS uses the network redirector interface to access them.  4. While INTERSVR is running, it displays a list of redirected drives and printers onscreen.  The left column lists the disk drives and printers on the server that are being shared, and the right column lists the letters and or ports that are being used on the client computer to access the server drives. To exit INTERSVR and disconnect the Interlnk net- work, press Alt+F4.  5. You can’t use the computer for anything else while INTERSVR is running. If you start INTERSVR in a task-switching environment such as Windows, it doesn’t allow you to switch to another task without first exiting the INTERSVR program. Don’t try to access any memory-resident programs; serious data loss could result. To be safe, you might want to disable or remove memory-resident programs before running INTERSVR.  6. Redirected Interlnk drives do not support disk-level operations, and the following DOS  commands should not be used on redirected drives:  CHKDSK DEFRAG DEBUG DISKCOMP DISKCOPY FDISK  FORMAT MIRROR SCANDISK SYS UNDELETE UNFORMAT  Third-party utilities that require low-level disk access also should be avoided.  7. INTERSVR.EXE requires DOS 3.0 or later to run. You can run different versions of DOS  on the client and server computers, although the limitations of each version must be respected. For example, disk partitions greater than 32MB on an Interlnk server are accessible on an Interlnk client running DOS 3.0.  The Microsoft MS-DOS 6 license agreement requires at least one of the two computers involved to be running a licensed copy of MS-DOS 6.   8. An appropriate cable is required to connect two computers with Interlnk. If you’re using serial ports for the Interlnk connection, a 3-wire or 7-wire null-modem serial cable is required. If you are using parallel ports, an 11-wire parallel cable is required. These cables often are referred to as LapLink cables in honor of the product that popu- larized this simple type of network. Check the two computers to see what type of con- nectors you need. Microsoft includes detailed wiring charts for these cables in the entry for INTERLNK in the DOS 6 online help system  that is, type HELP INTERLNK at the DOS prompt and click the Notes entry .  App F   784  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  Before you start the Interlnk server program, connect the two computers you want to link by using an appropriate serial or parallel cable. You also might want to remove or disable any resident programs you are running. You don’t have to quit Windows or the DOS Shell, but you cannot switch to another task while the Interlnk server program is running.  To start the Interlnk server program, type the following command: INTERSVR  INTERSVR scans your ports looking for an Interlnk connection. After it finds one, INTERSVR makes all local drives and printers on the server computer available to the Interlnk client.  If you are using a serial mouse, you should specify the port Interlnk should use. For exam- ple, if your mouse is attached to COM1 and you want to use COM2 on the server for the Interlnk connection, add the  COM2 parameter as follows: INTERSVR   COM2  If you don’t need access to either of the server’s floppy disk drives  A: and B:, in this exam- ple  from the client computer, you can exclude them by adding an  X=drive: parameter like this: INTERSVR   COM2   X=A:  B:  If either computer stops responding when you access a remote drive or printer, you might have to specify the  V parameter for INTERSVR as follows: INTERSVR   COM2   V  To use the remote copy feature, you must first connect the two computers with a 7-wire null- modem serial cable.  These cables often are referred to as LapLink cables, in honor of the company that made this sort of connection popular.  You cannot use parallel ports for this operation. Next, make sure that the computer which is to receive the Interlnk files is running DOS 3.0 or later and that the MODE command is available. Finally, on the computer contain- ing the Interlnk files, start the Interlnk server by using the  RCOPY parameter as follows: INTERSVR   RCOPY  INTERSVR leads you through the copy operation, prompting you at each step. After the files INTERLNK.EXE and INTERSVR.EXE have been successfully transferred, you can start up the Inter- lnk network by running INTERSVR on the server computer, adding the INTERLNK.EXE device dri- ver to the CONFIG.SYS file on the client computer, and rebooting the client computer.

JOIN is included on the DOS 6.0 Supplemental Disk, not in the stan- dard DOS 6.0 package.  AVOID  Syntax  To connect disk drives, use the following format:  JOIN drive: drive2:\dirname  To disconnect disk drives, use the following format:  JOIN drive:  D  To show currently connected drives, use the following format:  Parameters and Switches  JOIN  drive:  drive2:  Specifies the drive that you want to refer to as a subdirectory on another drive. DOS calls drive: the guest disk drive.  Specifies the drive to which drive: is to be connected. DOS calls drive2: the host disk drive. If drive2: isn’t specified, the current drive is assumed.   JOIN  3.1 to 5.0—External  787  \dirname  Specifies a subdirectory on drive2:  the host drive . DOS calls \dirname the host subdirectory. \dirname holds the connection to drive:  the guest drive , and should be empty. If \dirname doesn’t exist, DOS creates it.   D  Disconnects the specified guest drive from the host drive.  Rules  1. You must specify the guest drive when you make or change assignments. 2. If you do not name a host drive, DOS uses the current drive. 3. You must specify the host subdirectory. The host subdirectory cannot be the root direc-  tory of any drive.  4. The host and guest drives must not be network or CD-ROM drives. 5. The host and guest drives must not be part of a SUBST or ASSIGN command. 6. You cannot use the current drive as the guest drive. 7. If the host subdirectory does not exist, JOIN creates one. The subdirectory, if it exists,  must be empty  DIR must show only the . and .. entries .  8. When the drives are joined, the guest drive’s root directory and entire directory tree are  added to the host subdirectory. All subdirectories of the guest’s root directory become subdirectories of the host subdirectory.  9. A guest drive, when joined to the host drive, appears to be part of the host subdirectory.  You can access this drive only through the host drive and subdirectory.  10. To break the connection, specify the guest drive’s normal name with the  D switch. You  can use the guest drive’s normal name only when you disconnect the drives.  11. To see all the current drive connections, type JOIN with no parameters. If no connec-  tions exist, JOIN does not display any message, and the system prompt appears.  12. Do not use the BACKUP, CHKDSK, DISKCOMP, DISKCOPY, FDISK, RESTORE, or FORMAT command  13. When JOIN is in effect, the DIR command works normally but reports the bytes free  in the guest or host drive.  only for the host drive.  14. While JOIN is in effect, CHKDSK processes the host drive but does not process or report information on the guest portion of the drive. To run CHKDSK on the guest drive, you first must disconnect the guest drive from the host drive.  App F  Notes  1. You can use JOIN to connect a RAM disk to a real disk so that you can use the RAM  disk as though it were part of a floppy disk or hard disk drive. You also can use JOIN to connect two hard drives.  2. Some programs allow only one drive to hold data or certain parts of the program.  Programs written for DOS 2.0 and later, however, enable you to specify subdirectory   788  Appendix F Command Reference  names. If you use such a program, you can invoke the JOIN command to trick the pro- gram into using multiple drives as though the drives were one large drive.  3. JOIN does not affect the guest drive. Rather, JOIN affects only the way you access the  files in that drive. You cannot exceed the maximum number of files in the guest drive’s root directory. In the host subdirectory, a file’s size cannot exceed the guest drive’s size.  Messages  Directory not empty  Error: You tried to use a host subdirectory that is not empty; the subdirectory contains files other than the . and .. entries. Perform any one of the following actions before you try the command again:    Delete all files in the host subdirectory.   Specify an empty subdirectory.   Create a new subdirectory.   Name a nonexistent host subdirectory.

If a program fails to read the keyboard before the 17th character arrives, characters are lost. If you’re a fast typist, you might want to increase the size of the keyboard buffer with KBDBUF.SYS to avoid losing keystrokes. KBDBUF.SYS isn’t distributed with the standard DOS 6 package but is available from Microsoft on the MS-DOS 6 Supplemental Disk. You must load KBDBUF.SYS in a DEVICE= statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  DEVICE=drive:\path\KBDBUF.SYS bufsize  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  The full path to the KBDBUF.SYS file on your system. KBDBUF.SYS is avail- able on the DOS 6.22 Supplemental Disk. If you do not specify the full path to KBDBUF.SYS, DOS looks for the file in the root directory of the startup drive.  bufsize  The new keyboard buffer size, in bytes. Acceptable values are in the range of 16 to 1024. This parameter is required.   KBDBUF.SYS  device driver   External  789  1. Some programs read keystrokes directly from the keyboard, bypassing the keyboard buffer that the ROM BIOS maintains. KBDBUF.SYS does not affect programs that read the keyboard directly.  2. Do not attempt to load KBDBUF.SYS into upper memory by using the DEVICEHIGH= com-  mand. The ROM BIOS can’t use a keyboard buffer located in upper memory.  3. You should load the KBDBUF.SYS device driver as early as you can in CONFIG.SYS to avoid  troublesome interactions with other device drivers and resident programs.  4. Requesting a very large keyboard buffer is not normally a very good idea. If you have  increased it to 50 or 100 characters and your software is still losing keystrokes, the pro- gram is probably not using the keyboard buffer at all. A large keyboard buffer might be useful when you are injecting keystrokes into it from another source that can’t wait when the buffer is full.  To increase the size of the keyboard buffer to 32 characters, enter the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=C:\DOS\KBDBUF.SYS  32  This line assumes that you have copied the KBDBUF.SYS file from the DOS 6 Supplemental Disk to your C:\DOS subdirectory.  Part of the new keyboard buffer is beyond the range of the ROM BIOS data segment. Load this driver earlier in CONFIG.SYS, do not load it into high memory, or decrease the size of the buffer.  Error: KBDBUF.SYS couldn’t create the keyboard buffer you requested, usually because you tried to load it with the DEVICEHIGH= command. Use the DEVICE= command to load KBDBUF.SYS into conventional memory instead. Requested buffer size is too large.  Error: You have specified a keyboard buffer size larger than 1,024 characters, which is the maximum size allowed by KBDBUF.SYS. Requested buffer size is too small.  App F  Error: You have specified a keyboard buffer size under 16 characters, which is the minimum size allowed by KBDBUF.SYS.

The default code page is established by the COUNTRY directive in CONFIG.SYS or by the DOS default code page if the COUNTRY directive is not used.  3. You must specify a code page that is compatible with your keyboard code selection. 4. If you do not specify the keyboard definition file, it defaults to KEYBOARD.SYS. DOS  looks for this file in the current disk’s root directory. Otherwise, DOS uses the full file- name to search for the file. If you do not specify a disk drive, DOS searches the current disk drive.

The colon is required.   volume_label The disk’s new volume label.  App F  Rules  1. A valid volume label immediately becomes the volume label for the specified drive. 2. If you do not specify a volume label, DOS prompts you to enter a new one. You can  perform one of the following actions:    Type a valid volume name and then press Enter. DOS makes this name the new volume label. If a volume label already exists, DOS replaces the old volume label with the new.   794  Appendix F Command Reference    Press Enter to delete the current label without specifying a replacement label.  DOS asks you to confirm the deletion.  3. If you enter an invalid volume label, DOS responds with a warning message and asks  again for the new volume label.  4. Do not use LABEL in a networked disk drive  one that belongs to another computer .  If you try to label a networked drive, DOS displays an error message and ignores the command.  5. Do not use LABEL on a disk in any drive that is affected by the SUBST, JOIN, or ASSIGN  commands because DOS labels the “real” disk in the drive instead. Suppose that you use the command ASSIGN A=C. If you then enter the command LABEL A:, DOS actually changes the volume label of the disk in drive C.  6. A label consists of up to 11 printing characters and may include spaces but not tabs or  any of the following characters: *  ?     \    .  ,  ;  :  +  =  [  ]        &  ^    Lowercase ASCII characters are mapped to uppercase.  Notes  1. When you format a disk in DOS 4.0 and later versions, DOS prompts you to enter a volume label. Whether or not you assign a label, DOS gives the disk a serial number. The serial number is not part of the volume label. Remember that a space is a valid character in a volume label.  2. Spaces and underscores can increase the readability of a volume label. DOS 3.0 and 3.1, however, reject a space in a volume name when the name is typed in the command line  for example, LABEL MY DISK . To put a space in a volume label, type LABEL, press the spacebar, type the drive name  if needed , and then press Enter. Do not type a volume label in the command line. When LABEL asks for a new volume label, you can type the label with spaces.  Messages  Delete current volume label  Y N ?  Information and Warning: You did not enter a volume label when DOS prompted you. DOS is asking whether to delete the current label or to leave it unaltered. To delete the current label, press Y; to keep the label intact, press N.  See Also  FORMAT and VOL  “Naming Disks with LABEL” in Chapter 7   LASTDRIVE=  3.0 and later—Internal  795  LASTDRIVE=  CONFIG  SYS  3.0 and later—Internal  If you’re connected to a network, running MSCDEX for access to a CD-ROM drive, or using the SUBST command to create drive aliases, you might need the LASTDRIVE= command to tell DOS to save space for the additional drive letters you’ll need. You can use LASTDRIVE= only in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Syntax  LASTDRIVE=drive  Parameters and Switches  drive  Notes  The letter of the last disk drive that you want to have available. Note that drive is entered without a trailing colon. Valid letters are A to Z. The default value is either E or the last drive letter allocated during the processing of your CONFIG.SYS file, whichever is higher.  1. If you specify a letter lower than the number of letters needed for your system, DOS  overrides it and allocates space for the drives your system has. For instance, if you have one floppy and one hard drive and you specify LASTDRIVE=A, DOS allocates space in  the current directory data structure for drives A, B, and C  as if you had specified  LASTDRIVE=C . DOS does not display an error message if it overrides your LASTDRIVE= parameter. Notice that DOS allocates two floppy drive letters  A and B  even if you have only one floppy disk drive installed in the system.  2. Each additional drive letter  above E  you have available increases the size of DOS in  memory. If you aren’t attached to a network, running a CD-ROM drive, or using SUBST drive aliases, you have little reason to waste memory on extra drive letters.  3. You never need LASTDRIVE= for a device that is assigned a drive letter when its driver is  loaded in CONFIG.SYS. This includes drives assigned by DoubleSpace, RAMDRIVE.SYS, INTERLNK.EXE, or DRIVER.SYS. LASTDRIVE= is needed only to reserve space for drive let- ters created after the processing of your CONFIG.SYS file is complete.  Examples  If you are attached to a network, you usually want the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file: LASTDRIVE=Z  This line allows room for the maximum number of drive letters, leaving plenty of room to attach network drives. On the other hand, if you have two floppy drives  A and B , a hard disk with two partitions  C and D , a RAM disk  E , and have run DBLSPACE to compress both partitions  hosts assigned to I and J , your highest drive letter is J. To leave room for two additional drives after J, you can enter the following command: LASTDRIVE=L  App F   796  Appendix F Command Reference  Notice that in the preceding example, drive letters F, G, H, K, and L would be available for network, CD-ROM, or SUBST drives. If you had included no LASTDRIVE= command, drive letters F, G, and H would still be available.  Bad command or parameters Error in CONFIG.SYS line number  Warning: If you specify an invalid parameter for LASTDRIVE=, you get this error message. A very common mistake is to enter a colon after the drive letter in the LASTDRIVE= command.

This parameter is required.  parameters  Speciﬁes any parameters you want passed to program when it’s loaded into memory.   LOADHIGH or LH  5.0 and later—Internal  799   L:region,min   DOS 6  Speciﬁes the region in upper memory, and optionally the mini- mum size in bytes, into which the program should be loaded. You can spec- ify more than one region by separating each region from the preceding one with a semicolon. For instance,  L:1;2 allows the program access to UMB regions 1 and 2, and  L:1,4096;2,512 further speciﬁes that the minimum size of regions 1 and 2 should be 4,096 and 512 bytes, respectively. This parameter must precede the program’s ﬁlename on the line. MemMaker sets these values for you.   DOS 6  If you specify the  L parameter with a minimum size,  S instructs DOS to shrink the UMB to the speciﬁed size and create a new UMB from the remainder.  S must precede the program’s ﬁlename on the line. This switch is best left to MemMaker’s use.  In DR DOS, HILOAD is an alternative to the LOADHIGH command that performs the same function.   S  Notes  DR-DOS  Rules  1. You must use an upper memory manager. For a computer equipped with an 80386SX or  higher microprocessor and at least 1MB of RAM, DOS provides EMM386.EXE.  2. Your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle must contain at least the following statements  or the equivalent  third-party memory-management routines : DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=EMM386.EXE  RAM   or NOEMS  DOS=UMB  3. If not enough upper memory is available to accommodate a program, DOS loads the  program into conventional memory without warning.  4. When a program is loaded by default into the largest free UMB, that program automat- ically gains access to all other UMBs. If you use  L, you have to explicitly grant the pro- gram access to other upper memory regions by specifying other  L parameters.  5.  S normally is used only by MemMaker, which analyzes a program’s memory usage to  determine whether  S is safe.  6. You can use  S only when you also include an  L switch that speciﬁes a minimum size. 7. Use min when a program is larger when it runs than when it loads. 8. Use MEM  F to determine the size of free regions.  App F  Examples  To load the driver into upper memory regions 1 and 3, use the following format: LOADHIGH   L:1;3  C:\BIN\MYDRV.COM   800  Appendix F Command Reference  See Also  DEVICEHIGH=, MEM, and MEMMAKER  “Loading Device Drivers and TSRs into Upper Memory” in Chapter 19  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  MD or MKDIR  2.0 and later—Internal  The MD  or MKDIR  command can create new subdirectories on your disks. Storing ﬁles in various subdirectories helps you to keep them organized, and with MD, you can create as many as you need.  Syntax  MD drive:\path  MKDIR  drive:\path  Parameters and Switches  drive:  path  The drive: on which you want to create a new subdirectory. If you omit drive:, DOS assumes the current drive.  The subdirectory on drive: that you want to create. path can be either absolute or relative—that is, speciﬁed from the root directory or speciﬁed from the cur- rent directory  see Note 7 in the following section . If you specify only the name, DOS creates the new subdirectory in the current directory. You cannot create a subdirectory with the same name as a ﬁle in its parent directory.  Notes  1. Separate each subdirectory in path with a backslash  \  character. The last subdirectory  name in path is the subdirectory created.  2. You must specify the new subdirectory name  1 to 8 characters ; specifying an extension  is optional. The name must conform to the rules for creating directory names.  Avoid using extensions with subdirectory names. Although doing so is perfectly legal, having them “extensionless” makes them easier to pick out from the ﬁlenames in a directory listing. This practice has become so pervasive that certain programs have difﬁ- culties using subdirectories with extensions because they are rather uncommon and rarely tested for in new software.  Keep your subdirectory names as short as you can. Doing so can help with DOS’s 63-character pathname limit and 127-character command-line limit, and it saves typing as well.   MD or MKDIR  2.0 and later—Internal  801  3. You cannot use a directory name that is identical to a ﬁlename in the parent directory. If  you have a ﬁle named MYFILE in the current directory, for example, you cannot create the subdirectory MYFILE in this directory. If the ﬁle is named MYFILE.TXT, however, the names do not conﬂict, and you can create the MYFILE subdirectory.  4. The maximum length of a path  from the root directory to the ﬁnal directory  is 63  characters, including the backslashes.  5. You are not restricted to creating subdirectories in the current directory. If you add a  pathname, DOS establishes a new subdirectory in the directory that you specify.  6. You must put a colon after the drive letter if it is included. If you don’t include the  colon, DOS interprets the drive letter as a subdirectory name, which is probably not what you wanted.  7. If a backslash  \  is the ﬁrst  or only  character in a subdirectory path, it’s considered  absolute and speciﬁed starting from the root directory. If the subdirectory path begins with a subdirectory name, it’s considered relative, and the current directory is used as its starting point. A drive letter, followed by a colon, can precede either an absolute or a relative path.

MEM displays the status of extended memory only if you have more than 1MB of memory  in your computer. If you have only 1MB or less, you don’t have any extended memory.  3.

Runs MemMaker in batch  unattended  mode. When you use this switch, DOS takes only the default actions and, if an error occurs, restores  your CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and  if necessary  Microsoft Windows SYSTEM.INI ﬁles. You can determine what was done by looking in the MEMMAKER.STS ﬁle.  Used only by MemMaker during its optimization process. Do not specify this parameter.  Speciﬁes your boot drive’s original disk letter, the one that refers to the drive when your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle begins. You need this switch only in rare cases  for example, when disk-compression software, such as Stacker 1.0, swaps drive letters . Unless MemMaker knows your boot disk drive, it cannot ﬁnd your startup ﬁles. You do not need this switch if you are using DoubleSpace, Stacker 2.0 or later, or SuperStor.  Disables IBM Token Ring detection. Use this switch only if you are con- nected to a Token Ring network and have trouble running MemMaker.

Use this switch if your system does not work after you run MemMaker or if you are dissatisﬁed with the new conﬁguration.  Speciﬁes how much upper memory  in kilobytes  to reserve for Microsoft Windows translation buffers. Windows needs two such buffers in either upper or conventional memory. size1 is the size of the ﬁrst, and size2 is the size of the second. You might need to increase these values if Windows begins to run slowly after optimizing with MemMaker. The default is  W:0,0; MemMaker reserves no upper memory for Windows translation buffers.

CONFIG  SYS  MENUCOLOR=  6.0 and later—Internal Normally, DOS displays a startup menu in white text on a black background. When you use the MENUCOLOR= command, you can choose the screen colors that DOS uses. This command affects all text that DOS displays onscreen, not just the startup menu. You can use  MENUCOLOR= only inside a menu block in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Syntax  MENUCOLOR=textcolor,background  Parameters and Switches  textcolor  background  The color to use for foreground text. Legal values are 0 through 15  see the following table of color values . This parameter is required.  The color to use for the background. Legal values are 0 through 15  see the following table of color numbers . On some displays, using background colors with values higher than 7 causes the screen to blink. Do not include a space after the comma, or DOS ignores the entire MENUCOLOR= command. If no value is entered, DOS assumes Black  0 .  App F  Value 0 1  Color Black Blue  Value 8 9  Color Gray Bright Blue   806  Appendix F Command Reference  Value 2 3 4 5 6 7  Color Green Cyan Red Magenta Brown White  Value 10 11 12 13 14 15  Color Bright Green Bright Cyan Bright Red Bright Magenta Yellow Bright White  Notes  1. The MENUCOLOR= command can appear only once inside each menu block in CONFIG.SYS. 2. CONFIG.SYS allows two types of blocks: menu blocks and conﬁguration blocks. Each block  begins with a [blockname] and includes all the lines that follow, up to the next  [blockname]. Menu blocks, which are blocks named [MENU] or deﬁned with a SUBMENU= command, can include only menu-related commands. All other CONFIG.SYS commands belong in conﬁguration blocks.  3. If you do not specify a MENUCOLOR= command, the menu is displayed in white  7  on  black  0 . If only a foreground text color is speciﬁed, the background remains black  0 . You cannot set the background color without also setting the foreground text color.  4. Color choices set with this command remain in effect until another command or pro- gram resets them. Running CLS or loading the ANSI.SYS device driver resets the screen to its default colors.  Unlike many other commands, the MENUCOLOR= command does not allow a space  after the comma between its parameters. If you include a space, DOS ignores the  MENUCOLOR= command and does not set your color choices.  5. If you select a bright background color  values higher than 7 , some displays set the  blink attribute for the foreground text, and all the text onscreen starts to blink. Although blinking text may be annoying, it does no harm, and you can turn it off by using the CLS or MODE CO80 command. To ﬁx the problem, choose a background color between 0 and 7, and restart your computer.  6. A really nasty mistake is to set the foreground color the same as the background color.  Because you can’t read any of the prompts when the colors are the same, you might need to reboot and use the F5 Clean key to bypass your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. Alternatively, you can select a menu choice blind  press 1 and then press Enter , wait for all the drive activity to stop, and then type CLS and press Enter.   MENUDEFAULT= 6.0 and later—Internal  807  Examples  Suppose that you want to set up a menu that enables you to choose from three basic conﬁg- urations for your computer: Windows, DOS, and Maintenance. To jazz it up a bit, you want to set the screen colors to bright blue text on a white background. To do so, add the follow- ing lines to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: [MENU] MENUITEM=WIN, Configure for Windows  Default  MENUITEM=DOS, Configure for MS-DOS MENUITEM=MAINT, Configure for File & Disk Maintenance MENUDEFAULT=WIN, 30 MENUCOLOR=9,7  The MENUCOLOR= command sets the foreground color to bright blue  9  and the background color to white  7 . These colors remain in effect until another program resets them.  See Also  [blockname], MENUDEFAULT=, MENUITEM=, and SUBMENU=  “Creating Multiple Conﬁgurations” in Chapter 2  MENUDEFAULT=  CONFIG  SYS  6.0 and later—Internal  Using the MENUDEFAULT= command, you can select which startup conﬁguration DOS exe- cutes if no keys are pressed within the timeout period you specify. Without this command, DOS chooses menu item 1 and waits for you to press the Enter key. If you specify a default conﬁguration and timeout period, DOS can continue booting without you. You can use MENUDEFAULT= only inside a menu block in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Syntax  MENUDEFAULT=blockname, timeout  Parameters and Switches  blockname  The menu line that DOS should highlight when the menu is displayed. If you specify a timeout value, DOS executes this conﬁguration block automati- cally after timeout seconds. blockname must match the corresponding entry in a MENUITEM= or SUBMENU= command. This argument is required.  App F  timeout  The number of seconds, from 0 to 90, that DOS should wait before execut- ing the blockname conﬁguration block. If you do not specify a timeout value, DOS waits until you press the Enter key before executing the selected con- ﬁguration. A timeout value of 0 executes the blockname conﬁguration block without displaying the menu onscreen at all.   808  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  CONFIG.SYS.  1. The MENUDEFAULT= command can appear only once inside each menu block in  2. CONFIG.SYS allows two types of blocks: menu blocks and conﬁguration blocks. Each block  begins with a [blockname] and includes all the lines that follow, up to the next  [blockname]. Menu blocks, which are blocks named [MENU] or deﬁned with a SUBMENU= command, can include only menu-related commands. All other CONFIG.SYS commands belong in conﬁguration blocks.  3. The menu item selected with the MENUDEFAULT= command displays highlighted  onscreen. You can move the highlight with the arrow keys or type the line number to select a different menu line. The Enter a Choice: prompt displays the number of the selected menu item.  4. When you specify a timeout value, DOS displays a countdown onscreen as it waits for you to override the default choice. If you press any key before the timeout period has elapsed, the timer stops, and DOS waits for you to make a menu selection and press the Enter key.  If the timeout parameter contains an illegal value, DOS assigns a timeout of zero, and the menu isn’t displayed at all. Not having a menu display can be troublesome when you are debugging a new menu. To determine whether an incorrectly set timeout value is causing the problem, press the F8 Interactive key when the Starting MS-DOS... message appears onscreen. If the menu appears, the timeout value is defaulting to zero. If the menu still doesn’t appear, look for undeﬁned or misspelled blocknames.  Examples  Suppose that you want to set up a menu that enables you to choose from three basic conﬁg- urations for your computer: Windows, DOS, and Maintenance. Because you normally work with Windows programs, you want the default choice to be the WIN conﬁguration. To do so, add the following lines to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: [MENU] MENUITEM=WIN, Configure for Windows  Default  MENUITEM=DOS, Configure for MS-DOS MENUITEM=MAINT, Configure for File & Disk Maintenance MENUDEFAULT=WIN, 30  When you include these lines in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, DOS searches for blocks named [WIN], [DOS], and [MAINT]. As long as those blocks exist in the ﬁle, the menu that DOS  displays looks something like this: MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu =====================  1. Configure for Windows  Default  2. Configure for MS-DOS   MENUITEM= 6.0 and later—Internal  809  3. Configure for File & Disk Maintenance  Enter a choice: 1  Entering 1, 2, or 3 at this menu instructs DOS to select the [WIN], [DOS], or [MAINT] block, respectively. If you don’t make an entry within about 30 seconds, DOS chooses the [WIN] conﬁguration by default.  See Also  [blockname], MENUCOLOR=, MENUITEM=, and SUBMENU=  “Creating Multiple Conﬁgurations” in Chapter 2  MENUITEM=  CONFIG  SYS  6.0 and later—Internal New with DOS 6 is the capability to deﬁne a startup menu from which you can choose the group of CONFIG.SYS commands to process when you reboot. You use the MENUITEM= com- mand to deﬁne the text of a menu line, as well as the conﬁguration block that DOS should process when that menu line is chosen. You can use MENUITEM= only inside a menu block in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Syntax  MENUITEM=blockname, menutext  Parameters and Switches  blockname  The name of the conﬁguration block that you want to execute when this menu item is chosen. blockname can be up to 70 characters long, but it can’t contain any spaces or the following special characters:  \     ,  ;  =  [  ]   For more details, see [blockname] in this command reference.  The CONFIG environment variable is set to the value of the blockname selected. This argu- ment is required.  menutext  The text you want DOS to display for this menu line. menutext can be up to 70 characters long and contain any text you want, including spaces. Separate menutext from blockname with a comma. If you do not provide menutext, DOS displays the blockname in the menu.  App F  Notes  1. The MENUITEM= command can appear only inside menu blocks in CONFIG.SYS. 2. CONFIG.SYS allows two types of blocks: menu blocks and conﬁguration blocks. Each block  begins with a [blockname], and includes all the lines that follow, up to the next   810  Appendix F Command Reference  [blockname]. Menu blocks, which are blocks named [MENU] or deﬁned with a SUBMENU= command, can include only menu-related commands. All other CONFIG.SYS commands belong in conﬁguration blocks.  3. The top-level  ﬁrst  menu block must be named [MENU] so that DOS can recognize it.  You can name additional menu blocks that you deﬁne with the SUBMENU= command any- thing you like.  4. Up to nine choices can be displayed in a menu, so you are limited to nine MENUITEM=  and or SUBMENU= commands in a menu block. The menu items are displayed onscreen in the order that they appear in the menu block, numbered from 1 to 9.  5. If DOS cannot ﬁnd the block referred to by a MENUITEM= command in your CONFIG.SYS  ﬁle, it doesn’t display that choice in the menu. To get around this limitation, add a [blockname] line to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, but don’t include any commands in it.  6. DOS sets the CONFIG environment variable equal to the name of the conﬁguration block  selected from the startup menu. You can use the CONFIG variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle to continue customizing your system’s conﬁguration based on the choice you made at the startup menu.  If you intend to use the CONFIG variable in GOTO statements in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle, try to keep your blocknames short. Only the ﬁrst eight characters in a batch ﬁle label are signiﬁcant, so if any of your blocknames start with the same eight characters, one or more of the GOTO labels you set up will never be reached. You can get around this limitation by using the IF command to make comparisons or by simply using shorter blocknames.  Examples  Suppose that you want to set up a menu that enables you choose from three basic conﬁgura- tions for your computer: Windows, DOS, and Maintenance. To do so, add the following lines to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: [MENU] MENUITEM=WIN, Configure for Windows  Default  MENUITEM=DOS, Configure for MS-DOS MENUITEM=MAINT, Configure for File & Disk Maintenance MENUDEFAULT=WIN, 30  When you include these lines in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, DOS searches for blocks named [WIN], [DOS], and [MAINT]. As long as those blocks exist in the ﬁle, the menu that DOS dis- plays looks something like this: MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu =====================  1. Configure for Windows  Default  2. Configure for MS-DOS   MIRROR 5.0—External  811  3. Configure for File & Disk Maintenance  Enter a choice: 1  Entering 1, 2, or 3 at this menu instructs DOS to select the [WIN], [DOS], or [MAINT] block, respectively.

MIRROR also can save partition table information to a ﬁle that UNFORMAT can use if your partition table becomes corrupted.  MIRROR is included on the DOS 6.0 Supplemental Disk, but not in the standard DOS 6 pack- age. For information about similar capabilities in DOS 6, see the section on the UNDELETE command later in this command reference.  Syntax  MIRROR drive: ...  Tdrive-entries   1  To save information about a drive partition, use the following format:  To quit tracking deleted ﬁles, use the following format:  Parameters and Switches  MIRROR   PARTN  MIRROR   U  drive: ...   Tdrive-entries  Speciﬁes the drive s  for which you want MIRROR to record FAT and root directory information. You can specify as many drive letters  with colons  as you want; just separate each one from the others with a space.  App F  Loads a memory-resident tracking program that records information about deleted ﬁles. The drive speciﬁes the drive where MIRROR saves information about deleted ﬁles. -entries is an optional value  ranging from 1 to 999  that speciﬁes the maximum number of deleted ﬁles to be tracked. Default values are listed in the table in following the Notes section.   812  Appendix F Command Reference  Keeps MIRROR from creating a backup of the mirror ﬁle when the FAT and root directory information are updated.   PARTN  Makes a copy of the drive’s partition table.  Removes the deleted-ﬁle tracking program from memory. You might not be able to unload MIRROR if you’ve loaded other resident software into memory after MIRROR.  1. Do not use the  T switch with drives that use JOIN or SUBST. 2. If you use ASSIGN, you must place this command before the MIRROR command. If possi- ble, don’t use any “pretender” programs while Mirror’s deleted-ﬁle tracking program is active.  3. DOS saves information about deleted ﬁles in the ﬁle PCTRACKR.DEL. The UNDELETE com-  mand uses this ﬁle. With DOS 6, UNDELETE has Delete Tracker and Delete Sentry options of its own, and you should use them in preference to Mirror’s deleted-ﬁle track- ing features.  4. DOS saves system information, the FAT, and the root directory in the ﬁle MIRROR.FIL.  The UNFORMAT command uses this ﬁle. FORMAT saves information for UNFORMAT as well. 5. DOS saves information about the hard drive partition in the ﬁle PARTNSAV.FIL. The  UNFORMAT command uses this ﬁle. In DOS 6, no utility in the standard package can save this information for UNFORMAT to use.   1   U  Rules  Notes  The MIRROR and UNFORMAT commands are not replacements for proper backups of your hard disk. Although the information that MIRROR saves can be very handy, full and regular backups are a much safer and more reliable means of ensuring that you do not lose data.  1. When you track deleted ﬁles, you can specify how many ﬁles are contained in the PCTRACKR.DEL ﬁle  1 to 999  by using the  Tdrive-entries parameter. The default  values, however, probably are satisfactory. Those values are as follows:  Size of Disk 360KB 720KB 1.2MB 1.44MB 20MB 32MB Larger than 32MB  Entries Stored 25 50 75 101 202 303   MODE 1.1 and later—External  813  2. Using the  PARTN switch with MIRROR creates the ﬁle PARTNSAV.FIL, which contains  information from the drive’s partition table. The partition initially is created with FDISK. You are instructed to place a ﬂoppy disk in drive A rather than save PARTNSAV.FIL on the hard disk. The ﬁle is saved on the disk. Label and store the disk in a safe place.  3. UNFORMAT, a companion command to MIRROR, uses these ﬁles. If you lose information, if you accidentally format a disk, or if the partition table is damaged, you can recover the lost information by using UNFORMAT if you previously used MIRROR.

Display Device Status Information  To display the status of any or all the devices that MODE can control, use the following com- mand format: MODE  device   STATUS  Parameters and Switches  device  The DOS device for which you want to see status information. device can be any one of the following:  Device Name COM1 through COM4 CON  LPT1 through LPT3 PRN  Description Serial communication ports The console, which is your keyboard and  display Parallel printer ports The primary printer port, normally LPT1  If you omit this parameter, MODE displays information about the status of all the devices attached to your system.  Including this parameter requests the status of any redirected parallel ports you may have set without canceling the redirection. If you omit the  STATUS parameter and you are redirecting any parallel ports, the redirection is can- celed when the information about that port is displayed. You can abbreviate  STATUS as  STA.   STATUS  Notes  1. If you ask for the status of the PRN device  for example, MODE PRN , MODE displays infor- mation about the code page status of the primary printer port. If you ask for the status of LPT1, however, it reports on the retry setting currently in effect.  2. You can include a colon after the device name or leave it off; its use is optional. 3. The AUX device, which is normally the same as COM1, is not recognized by the MODE  command.  4. Status information has been available from the MODE command since DOS 4.0.

Many programs initialize the ports themselves, but in case they don’t, DOS provides this functionality in the MODE COM command. The INTERSVR  RCOPY remote copy operation depends on the services of MODE COM to make the remote copy operation succeed, for instance.  Syntax  The old syntax, which is simple but not very intuitive, is as follows:  MODE COM: baud, parity, databits, stopbits, retry  If you are running DOS 4.0 or later, you can use the following format: MODE COM:  BAUD=baud  PARITY=parity  DATA=databits  STOP=stopbits  RETRY=retry  Parameters and Switches  :  baud  Speciﬁes the serial port that you want to initialize. DOS supports COM ports 1, 2, 3, and 4, but they may not all be installed in your computer. The colon after the number is optional.  Speciﬁes the baud rate to use. Legal values for baud are 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, or 19200. You need to enter only the ﬁrst two  digits—for instance, 24 instead of 2400.  Baud equals bits per second for rates higher than 300.  Not all computers can support 19200-baud serial transmis- sions.  App F  parity  Indicates the parity checking setting. Legal values are N for None, O for Odd, E for Even, M for Mark, or S for Space. Not all computers support the Mark and Space parity settings. The default setting is E.  databits  Speciﬁes the number of data bits. Legal values are 5 through 8. The default value is 7. Not all computers support 5 and 6 data bits.   816  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  stopbits  retry  Speciﬁes the number of stop bits. Legal values are 1, 1.5, and 2. If baud is 110, the default is 2; otherwise, the default is 1. Not all computers support 1.5 stop bits.  Instructs DOS about how to handle timeout errors. Using this parameter causes part of MODE to remain resident in memory. You can choose one of the following options:  retry  B  E  P  R N or NONE  Action Return busy when the port is busy Return error when the port is busy Retry until output is accepted Return ready when the port is busy  inﬁnite retry  Take no action  the default   1. For DOS versions before 5.0, you must enter the adapter’s number, followed by a space and baud rate. If you type the optional colon, you must type the adapter number imme- diately before the colon. All other parameters are optional.  2. Note that with the older, unlabeled syntax, MODE interprets each parameter by position  alone, and you must enter them in the order shown. If you do not want to enter a value for a particular parameter, enter a comma for that value, or use the newer syntax where relative position on the command line is unimportant.  3. If you enter an invalid parameter, DOS responds with an invalid-parameter message  and takes no further action.  4. You can abbreviate the baud rate parameter by using only the ﬁrst two digits of the  baud rate. For example, you can specify 11 for 110 baud, or 96 for 9600 baud.  5. If you want continuous retries after a timeout, you must enter RETRY=B  or P for versions  of DOS before 5.0  every time you use the MODE COM: command. Other settings remain in effect if you do not specify new values for them.  6. If the adapter is set for continuous retries  RETRY=B  and the device is not ready, the  computer may appear to hang up when it’s really just waiting for the port. You can abort this loop by pressing Ctrl+Break.  7. If you use a networked printer, do not specify any of the RETRY values. 8. To display the current status of a serial port, enter the MODE COM command without any  parameters. To display the status of all the DOS devices attached to your computer, enter the MODE command alone.

For the keyboard, MODE can set the keyboard repeat rate and delay. For the monitor, MODE can, with the help of the ANSI.SYS device driver, control the number of lines and columns displayed in text mode.  Syntax  To conﬁgure the keyboard, use the following format:  MODE  CON:  RATE=rate DELAY=delay  To conﬁgure the monitor, use the following format: MODE  CON:  COLS=columns LINES=lines  Parameters and Switches  Speciﬁes the console device. The colon is optional.  CON:  rate  delay  columns  lines  Notes  Speciﬁes the rate at which a character repeats when you hold down a key. Legal values are in the range of 1 to 32, which represents approximately 2 to 30 char- acters per second. The default is 20 for most keyboards and 21 for IBM PS 2 keyboards. To set the rate, you also must set the delay.  Speciﬁes the length of the delay between the initial pressing of the key and the start of automatic character repetition. This value can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, which represent delays of 1 4 second, 1 2 second, 3 4 second, and one full second, respectively. The default is 2. To set the delay, you also must set the rate.  Indicates the number of columns to display onscreen. Legal values are 40 and 80. Most computers start up in an 80-column screen mode. If you omit this parameter, the display keeps its present column setting.  Indicates the number of lines to display onscreen. Legal values are different for different types of monitors. CGA and MDA monitors support 25-line text modes only. EGA monitors support 25- and 43-line text modes. VGA monitors support 25-, 43-, and 50-line text modes. Most computers start up in a 25-line screen mode. If you omit this parameter, the display keeps its present lines setting.  App F  1. To set the keyboard repeat rate, you must specify both rate and delay settings. You  cannot use these parameters individually.  2. The CapsLock, ScrollLock, NumLock, and Insert keys never repeat, no matter how  long you hold them down.  3. Only enhanced keyboards support having their repeat rate changed. The original   84-key keyboards supplied with the IBM PC use a ﬁxed repeat rate and ignore the MODE CON command.   818  Appendix F Command Reference  4. Using the MODE CON command to change the number of lines and columns displayed on  your screen requires the assistance of the ANSI.SYS device driver. If ANSI.SYS isn’t in mem- ory when the command executes, an error message is displayed, and the requested screen mode change does not take place.  See the ﬁrst message in the “Messages” section.   Examples  To set the keyboard to repeat as quickly as possible but increase the delay before repeating to 3 4 of a second, you enter the following command: MODE  COM  RATE=32  DELAY=3  To reset the keyboard to its default values, you enter the following command: MODE  COM  RATE=20  DELAY=2  To set an EGA or VGA monitor to a 43-line text mode, you enter the following command: MODE  CON  LINES=43  Messages  ANSI.SYS must be installed to perform requested function  Error: MODE requires the assistance of the ANSI.SYS device driver to perform the requested operation, but it isn’t loaded. To use this MODE command, you have to add a DEVICE= line loading the ANSI.SYS device driver to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle and restart your computer. Rate and delay must be specified together  Error: MODE CON requires that you specify both the rate and delay settings in order to change the keyboard settings for these parameters. Make sure that you speciﬁed both para- meters on the command line.

You must prepare a code page before you can use it with the CHCP or the MODE device CODEPAGE SELECT commands. CODEPAGE can be abbre- viated as CP, and PREPARE can be abbreviated as PREP.  App F  Switches the current code page to the onespeciﬁed. The code page you  switch to must have been previously loaded with the MODE device CODEPAGE  PREPARE command, or be permanently available from the hardware. CODEPAGE can be abbreviated as CP, and SELECT can be abbreviated as SEL.  Reloads the current code page. You need to use this command if your printer  loses the code page information loaded into it by being turned off.

CODEPAGE PREPARE or CP PREP  CODEPAGE SELECT or  CP SEL  CODEPAGE  REFRESH or CP REF   820  Appendix F Command Reference  codepage  cpi_file  Speciﬁes the code page  character set  that you want to prepare or select. You can enter more than one codepage in the PREPARE command. For a list of the code pages supported by MS-DOS, see Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS.”  Speciﬁes the name and location of the ﬁle that contains code page informa- tion for the speciﬁed device. If you don’t specify a drive, DOS assumes the current drive. If you don’t specify a subdirectory path, DOS assumes the cur- rent directory. The ﬁlename is required.

STATUS  Displays the number of code pages prepared or selected for the speciﬁed device. You can include this parameter or leave it out; it makes no difference. Microsoft states that you can abbreviate it as  STA, but because you can abbreviate it to nothing, it hardly matters.  Notes  1. You must specify a valid device. The options are CON:, PRN:, LPT1:, LPT2:, and  LPT3:. The colon after the device name is optional.  2. MODE device CODEPAGE PREPARE prepares code pages  character sets  for the console  keyboard and display  and printers. Issue this subcommand before issuing the MODE device CODEPAGE SELECT subcommand, unless you use the IBM Quietwriter III printer, whose font information is contained in cartridges. If the code page that you need is in a cartridge, you do not need to use the PREPARE command.   MODE display 2.0 and later—External  821  3. For the PREPARE command, you must specify one or more code pages. You can use com-  mas or spaces to separate the numbers if you specify more than one. You must enclose the entire list of code pages in parentheses.  4. When you add or replace code pages by using a PREPARE command, enter a comma for  any code page that you do not want to change.  5. For the SELECT command, you must specify a single code page. The code page must be  either part of a MODE device CODEPAGE PREPARE command for the device or the hard- ware code page speciﬁed to the appropriate device driver.  6. MODE device CODEPAGE SELECT activates a currently prepared code page or reactivates   a hardware code page. You can use MODE device CODEPAGE SELECT only on these two types of code pages.  7. MODE device CODEPAGE SELECT usually downloads any software font to the device,  except for the Quietwriter III printer, which uses cartridges.  8. MODE device CODEPAGE SELECT activates code pages for individual devices. You can use  the CHCP command to activate the code pages for all available devices.  9. MODE device CODEPAGE REFRESH downloads, if necessary, and reactivates the currently selected code page on a device.

CGA and MDA monitors support  25-line text modes only. EGA monitors support 25- and 43-line text modes. VGA monitors support 25-, 43-, and 50-line text modes. Most computers start up in a 25-line screen mode. If you omit this parameter, the display keeps its current lines setting.   CGA displays only  Enables you to shift the onscreen image left or right. Legal values are L to shift left and R to shift right. In an 80-column mode, the screen shifts two characters at a time, and in a 40-column mode, one character at a time.   MODE display 2.0 and later—External  823   CGA displays only  Displays a test pattern. This parameter can help you when you are using the left and right shift parameter to get the screen centered.  T  Notes  1. The MODE CO80 command can be very handy for resetting your screen when it’s left in  an unknown state by an inconsiderate program. It also restores the cursor to its normal size and position. If your screen goes black when you exit a graphics utility program, for example, try typing in this command, even if you can’t see what you’re typing.  2. For the ﬁrst form of the command, you must enter the display_mode. All other parame-  ters are optional.  3. The second form of this command is legal to use only with displays that use a Color  Graphics Adapter  CGA . On any other type of display, this form of the command does nothing. To adjust a CGA display, you must enter the shift parameter  L or R , but you can avoid resetting the display_mode by typing a comma before the shift parame- ter. Depending on whether you are in a 40- or an 80-column screen mode, the screen shifts one or two characters to the right or left. Including the T parameter displays a test pattern onscreen and prompts you to type Y if the screen is centered or N to shift the display further left or right.  4. Using the MODE CON command to change the number of lines displayed on your screen requires the assistance of the ANSI.SYS device driver.  You can change the display_mode without ANSI.SYS, however.  If ANSI.SYS isn’t in memory when the command executes, an error message is displayed, and the requested screen mode change does not take place.  See the ﬁrst message in the “Messages” section.   Examples  If you have a CGA, EGA, or VGA display and you want to reset the screen to normal, including the shape of the cursor, enter the following command: MODE  CO80  MODE CO80 can be a lifesaver when a program leaves your screen in limbo.

You can set the lines and columns only for IBM- and Epson-compatible printers.  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  Syntax  MODE  LPT: columns, lines, retry  or MODE  LPT: COLS=columns  LINES=lines  RETRY=retry  To force DOS to print to a serial printer instead of a parallel printer, use the following for- mat:  MODE  LPT:=COM  Parameters and Switches  LPT:  COM:  columns  lines  retry  Speciﬁes the parallel printer port you want to conﬁgure. DOS supports LPT ports 1, 2, and 3, but they may not all be installed in your computer. The colon after the number is optional.  Speciﬁes the serial port to which you want to redirect printer output. DOS sup- ports COM ports 1, 2, 3, and 4, but they may not all be installed in your com- puter. The colon after the number is optional.   IBM- and Epson-compatible printers only  Indicates the number of characters per line to print on the printer. Legal values are 80 and 132. Most printers start up in an 80-column mode. If you omit this parameter, the printer keeps its cur- rent characters-per-line setting.   IBM- and Epson-compatible printers only  Speciﬁes the number of lines per inch to print on the printer. Legal values are 6 and 8. Most printers start up in a 6-line-per-inch mode. If you omit this parameter, the printer keeps its current lines-per-inch setting.  Instructs DOS about how to handle timeout errors. Using this parameter causes part of MODE to remain resident in memory. You can choose one of the following options:  retry  B  E  Action Return busy when the port is busy Return error when the port is busy   MODE LPT 3.2 and later—External  825  retry  P  R N or NONE  Action Retry until output is accepted Return ready when the port is busy  inﬁnite retry  Take no action  the default   Rules  meter.  1. When conﬁguring a parallel port, you must specify a printer number, but all other para-  meters are optional, including the colon after the printer number.  2. If you do not want to change a conﬁguration parameter, enter a comma for that para-  3. The MODE LPT:=COM: command cancels the effect of the MODE LPT: command. 4. A parameter does not change if you skip that parameter or use an invalid parameter.  The printer number, however, must be entered correctly.  5. In DOS 3.3 and earlier versions, if you specify P for continuous retries, you can cancel P only by reentering the MODE command without P. In later versions of DOS, the RETRY=B option has the same effect as the P option of previous DOS versions.  6. If you use a networked printer, do not use any of the RETRY values. 7. The characters-per-line and lines-per-inch portions of the command affect only IBM printers, Epson printers, and other printers that use Epson-compatible control codes.  8. When you are redirecting printer output, the ports you specify for both the parallel  printer port and serial printer port must be valid. In other words, you cannot redirect printer output to a serial printer if you don’t have a parallel port, and you can’t use a nonexistent parallel port to get around this problem.  9. After you issue the redirection command, all printing that normally goes to the parallel  printer goes to the designated serial printer. Programs that write directly to the hard- ware, such as Microsoft Windows, are not affected by this redirection. For such pro- grams, try printing to a ﬁle named LPT1.TXT, substituting whatever parallel port you’ve redirected.  10. If you are using a serial printer, you usually have to use the MODE COM command to set the parameters on your serial port to match the printer. Check your printer’s documen- tation to ﬁnd out the correct settings to use.  11. You can cancel or undo the redirection command by issuing the MODE LPT: command.  App F  Notes  This command controls IBM dot-matrix and graphics printers, all Epson printers, and Epson-compatible printers. The command may work partially or not at all on other printers.  When you change the column width, MODE sends the special printer-control code that speci- ﬁes the normal font  80  or the condensed font  132 . When you change the lines-per-inch setting, MODE sends the correct printer-control code for printing 6 or 8 lines per inch. MODE   826  Appendix F Command Reference  also sets the printer to 88 lines per page for an 8-lines-per-inch setting and to 66 lines per page for a 6-lines-per-inch setting.  If you use the P option of DOS 3.3 or earlier versions or the B retry option of later versions of DOS and attempt to print on a deselected printer, the computer does not issue a timeout error. Rather, the computer internally loops until the printer is ready  turned on, connected to the PC, and selected . For about a minute, the computer appears to be locked up. To abort the continuous retry, press Ctrl+Break.  The redirection capabilities of MODE are useful for systems that are connected to a serial printer. When you type the following command, the serial printer receives all the output that usually is sent to the system printer  assuming that the serial printer is connected to the ﬁrst Asynchronous Communications Adapter : MODE LPT1: = COM1:  This output includes the print-screen  Shift+PrtSc  function. Before you issue the MODE LPT=COMy command, use the MODE COMn: command to set up the serial adapter used for the serial printer.

There are a few good reasons why you might not want to use the monochrome region  as upper memory space on a VGA system.

If you omit parts of this parameter, DOS assumes the current drive and subdirectory as necessary.  old_dirname  Indicates the name of the subdirectory that you want to rename. You can include a disk drive and subdirectory path if you want. If old_dirname refers to a ﬁle, DOS moves the ﬁle instead.   MOVE 6.0 and later—External  829  new_dirname   Y   -Y  Indicates the new name that you want to give the old_dirname subdirectory. If new_dirname isn’t in the current directory, you must specify the same drive and or path you speciﬁed with old_dirname; otherwise, DOS thinks you are trying to move the subdirectory, which isn’t allowed.  Speciﬁes that you want MOVE to overwrite ﬁles without prompting you for conﬁrmation. Including this parameter overrides any setting speciﬁed with the COPYCMD environment variable.  Speciﬁes that you want MOVE to prompt you for conﬁrmation before over- writing any ﬁles, even if the command is run from within a batch ﬁle. Including this parameter overrides any setting speciﬁed with the COPYCMD environment variable.  Exit Codes  Notes  ERRORLEVEL Value 0 1  Meaning Files were moved successfully. Files weren’t moved due to errors or user abort.  1. Starting with DOS 6.2, the MOVE command, when run from the command line, prompts you for conﬁrmation before overwriting ﬁles. However, to avoid forcing you to rewrite all of your batch ﬁles, when you run MOVE from a batch ﬁle, it does not prompt you before overwriting a ﬁle. If you don’t like MOVE’s new behavior, you can change it by deﬁning an environment variable named COPYCMD. Setting COPYCMD equal to  Y forces MOVE to act as it did in all previous versions of DOS, never prompting for conﬁrmation before overwriting a ﬁle. If you set COPYCMD equal to  -Y, MOVE always prompts for conﬁrmation, even when it’s run from within a batch ﬁle.  2. If you move a ﬁle to a directory that already includes a ﬁle with that name, DOS over-  writes the ﬁle in the destination directory without warning.  3. You cannot rename a directory that you are moving to a different disk or to a different  relative position on a disk. The drive and path in front of both old_dirname and new_dirname have to be the same.  App F  4. If the destination directory does not exist, DOS can create it automatically. 5. If you specify several ﬁles to be moved and a ﬁlename rather than a directory as the des-  tination, DOS displays the message Cannot move multiple files to a single file. 6. If a MOVE operation is successful, DOS returns an ERRORLEVEL of 0. If an error occurs,  DOS returns a value of 1.   830  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  To move the ﬁle README.TXT in the current directory and the ﬁle C:\BIN\SETUP.EXE to the directory C:\TEMP  the ﬁles are not renamed , enter the following: MOVE  README.TXT, C:\BIN\SETUP.EXE  C:\TEMP  To change the name of the ﬁle README.TXT in the current directory to README.1ST, enter the following: MOVE  README.TXT  README.1ST  To move and rename C:\INFO\README.TXT to C:\TEMP\README.BAK, enter the following: MOVE  C:\INFO\README.TXT  C:\TEMP\README.BAK  To change the name of the directory C:\BIN to C:\OLDBIN, enter the following: MOVE  C:\BIN  C:\OLDBIN  See Also  COPY, REN or RENAME, and XCOPY  “Using the MOVE Command” in Chapter 8  Microsoft Anti-Virus  MSAV  is a full-screen program that can help you to detect and clean any computer viruses found in your system.

Speciﬁes that you want MSAV to remove  clean  any viruses it ﬁnds. Using this switch causes MSAV to start scanning immediately.  Speciﬁes that MSAV should record the results of each scan in a ﬁle  MSAV.RPT  that is created in the root directory of each drive scanned.  Causes MSAV to scan all your drives, including network and CD-ROM drives, but not ﬂoppy disk drives. If you have a CD-ROM drive or are connected to a network, you should probably avoid this switch.  Causes MSAV to scan all your local drives, including any ﬂoppy disk drives, but not network and CD-ROM drives.  Speciﬁes that MSAV should not display anything at all while it’s working. It displays the contents of the MSAV.TXT ﬁle if it exists in the same subdirectory as MSAV.EXE  normally C:\DOS . If a virus is found, an exit code of 86 is returned instead of a warning message. When the speciﬁed scanning opera- tion is completed, MSAV terminates automatically, making it suitable for use in a batch ﬁle. You cannot specify both the  P and  N switches.  Activates MSAV’s command-line interface instead of the full-screen interface it normally uses. When the speciﬁed scanning operation is completed, MSAV ter- minates automatically, making it suitable for use in a batch ﬁle. You cannot specify both the  P and  N switches.  Speciﬁes that you do not want MSAV to display a list of the ﬁles it’s scanning. You can use this switch only with the  N or  P switch.  App F   video  MSAV provides quite a few video-related options.

MSBACKUP 6.0 and later—External  833  See Also  MWAV and VSAFE  “Understanding Computer Viruses” in Chapter 9  MSBACKUP  6.0 and later—External Microsoft Backup  MSBACKUP  is a full-screen program that can back up the contents of your hard disk to a series of ﬂoppy disks  or another DOS-accessible drive . You can deﬁne setup ﬁles that record your preferences and enable you to quickly perform different backup chores. No matter how careful you are, you should periodically back up the contents of your hard disk.  Syntax  MSBACKUP  setupfile   BW   LCD   MDA  Parameters and Switches  setupfile  Speciﬁes the ﬁle that holds your saved settings, the names of the ﬁles to be backed up, and the type of backup you want. This ﬁle must have an .SET extension. The default is DEFAULT.SET. DOS searches for this ﬁle in the sub- directory pointed to by the MSDOSDATA environment variable if you do not specify drive or subdirectory information in the pathname.  Speciﬁes that MSBACKUP should use colors appropriate for a black-and-white display.  Speciﬁes that MSBACKUP should use colors appropriate for a liquid-crystal dis- play.  Speciﬁes that MSBACKUP should use colors appropriate for a monochrome dis- play adapter.   BW   LCD   MDA  Rules  1. You do not explicitly create a setup ﬁle. MSBACKUP creates a setup ﬁle  or updates it, if  you speciﬁed one in the MSBACKUP command line  when you save your program settings and ﬁle selections.  App F  2. You cannot start MSBACKUP from a ﬂoppy disk. This utility and its other program ﬁles  must be on your hard disk.  3. When looking for its conﬁguration information, backup sets, and catalogs, MSBACKUP  ﬁrst looks in the directory speciﬁed by the MSDOSDATA environment variable, then in the directory from which it was started, and then in the current directory. You can use MSDOSDATA to point to your own conﬁguration if you share MSBACKUP with other people.  4. DOS 6.0 includes a Microsoft Windows version of MSBACKUP.   834  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  1. When it performs a backup, MSBACKUP creates a catalog ﬁle that contains information  about the ﬁles that it backs up. When you need to restore a ﬁle, you can search the cat- alog ﬁles to determine which one contains the ﬁles you want. Catalog ﬁles encode information in their names. Decoding CD10401A.FUL, for example, yields the following characters:  Character C D  3 04 01 A  FUL  Meaning The ﬁrst drive backed up in this set. The last drive backed up in this set.  Had C been the only drive, the catalog ﬁle’s name would have been CC10401A.FUL.  The last digit of the year of the backup  here, 2001 . The month of the backup  here, April . The day of the backup  here, the ﬁrst . The ID of the backup on that day. If more than one backup of the same drive s  is performed on the same day and the Keep Old Backup Catalogs options is set, MSBACKUP assigns a letter, from A through Z, to indicate the order in which the otherwise identically named catalog ﬁles were created. A is the ﬁrst, B is the second, and so on. If the Keep Old Backup Catalogs option is not set, the ID alternates between A and B. The backup type  here, FULL . The other possibilities are INC  incre- mental  and DIF  differential .  2. When you perform a full backup, MSBACKUP creates a master catalog ﬁle, which keeps  track of all the backup catalogs that are made during a backup cycle. When you need to restore a ﬁle, loading the master catalog automatically merges all the catalogs of the backup cycle, so you can select the latest version of a ﬁle easily  although you can choose to restore an earlier version . MSBACKUP puts one copy of the backup catalog on your hard disk and a second copy on the disk or network drive that contains your backup set.  3. If DOS displays the message Insufficient memory while you are using MSBACKUP, follow  these steps:  a. Make sure that your computer has at least 512KB of conventional memory. b. Quit MSBACKUP, remove all memory-resident programs  TSRs  from memory, and  c. In MSBACKUP, turn off the Compress Backup Data option  in the Disk Backup  try again.  Options dialog box .  See Also  MWBACKUP  “Understanding Microsoft Backup” in Chapter 9   MSCDEX 6.0 and later—External  835  6.0 and later—External  MSCDEX provides DOS access to CD-ROM drives. CD-ROM drives usually have their own device drivers, but these drivers aren’t directly accessible to DOS. MSCDEX uses the network redirector interface to assign a drive letter to a CD-ROM drive. To be able to use MSCDEX, you must have one or more drive letters available and often have to include the LASTDRIVE= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle to set them aside.  MSCDEX  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  Syntax  MSCDEX   D:driversig ...  E   K   S   V   L:letter   M:number  Parameters and Switches   D:driversig ...   E   K   S   V   L:letter   M:number  For each CD-ROM drive to which you want to assign a drive letter, you need to specify the driver signature  driversig  that you assigned to its device driver with the  D switch when you loaded it in your  CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. You must specify at least one driver signature.  Enables the CD-ROM driver to use available expanded memory to store its sector buffers, thus conserving conventional memory for application programs.  Enables recognition of Kanji  Japanese  CD-ROM labels. Normally, MSCDEX cannot recognize Japanese CD-ROM disks.  Enables sharing of CD-ROM drives on an MS-NET or Windows for Workgroups network server.  Displays memory statistics when MSCDEX starts  Verbose .  Speciﬁes the drive letter to be assigned to the ﬁrst CD-ROM. Additional CD-ROMs are assigned letters in sequence. These drive letters must be available for use. The default is to use the next avail- able drive letter s .  Speciﬁes the number of sector buffers MSCDEX should use to buffer CD-ROM reads. More buffers can increase the speed of your  CD-ROM drive, but they also use more memory. You can put these buffers in expanded memory by using the  E switch.  App F  Notes  1. Your CD-ROM’s device driver must be loaded by your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. It should in-  clude a  D parameter to assign a driver signature  also called a driver name  to the driver.  2. Your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle must include a LASTDRIVE command that provides enough device  letters for your network, SUBST, and MSCDEX needs.  3. MSCDEX can be invoked by your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle or from the DOS command line. 4. You need to invoke MSCDEX before you start Microsoft Windows.   836  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  Following is a typical CONFIG.SYS line that loads a device driver to access a CD-ROM drive. Notice that the driver signature is assigned with the  D switch: DEVICE=C:\DEVICES\CDROMDRV.SYS   D:MSCD000  The following line would most likely be included in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle and would enable the MSCD000 CD-ROM drive as drive E: C:\DOS\MSCDEX   D:MSCD000   L:E  See Also  LASTDRIVE=  MSD  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  Syntax  6.0 and later—External  MSD, which stands for Microsoft System Diagnostics, is a handy tool for checking what is going on in a computer system. Via certain command-line options, you can instruct MSD to generate text ﬁles that record the state of your computer. These reports can be very useful when you are troubleshooting.  To use MSD interactively with a full-screen display, use the following format: MSD  B   I  To use MSD to generate a report to a ﬁle, use the following format: MSD   I   Fpathname   Ppathname   Spathname  Parameters and Switches   B   I   Fpathname   Ppathname  Forces the display to black and white for monochrome or LCD displays.  Prevents MSD from detecting hardware when it starts. Use this switch if MSD does not start or run properly on your computer.  Speciﬁes that you want a full report generated. MSD prompts you for certain information  your name, company, address, country, telephone number, and comments  and then incorporates that information into a report that it writes to the speciﬁed ﬁle. You can specify a full pathname with drive and or path information, but wildcards are not allowed. If you do not include pathname, MSD writes the report to the screen.  Speciﬁes that you want a partial report generated. A partial report contains all the detailed system information but none of the identifying information that  F prompts you for. You can specify a full pathname with drive and or path information, but wildcards are not allowed. If you do not include  pathname, MSD writes the report to the screen.   MSHERC 5.0—External  837   Spathname  Speciﬁes that you want a summary report generated. A summary report  provides a shorter listing that highlights the key features of your computer’s conﬁguration. You can specify a full pathname with drive and or path infor- mation, but wildcards are not allowed. If you do not include pathname, MSD writes the report to the screen.  MSD provides information about your computer  for example, its manufacturer, bus type, and ROM BIOS manufacturer  and about its upper memory use, video display, network, operat- ing system, mouse, other adapters, disk drives, LPT ports, COM ports, IRQ stations, TSR programs, and device drivers. This information can be valuable when you are correcting problems or installing new hardware.  Notes  See Also  MEM  MSHERC  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  DISK  5.0—External  Because the Hercules Monochrome Graphics Adapter had no support built into the ROM BIOS of the computer, to use the display, programmers had to write their own drivers. The MSHERC program, when run, installs itself in memory and provides BIOS-like services for a Hercules Graphics Adapter. Certain QBasic programs require the use of this program to run. If you do not use a Hercules Graphics Adapter, you will have no use for this command. MSHERC is not distributed in the standard DOS 6 package but is available on the DOS 6 Supplemental Disk.  Syntax  MSHERC  HALF  Parameters and Switches   HALF  Specifying this parameter enables you to use a Hercules Graphics Adapter and a Color Graphics Adapter  CGA  in the same system. It limits the driver to using only the memory on the Hercules card, which does not conﬂict with standard CGA memory space.  App F  Notes  Hercules has stopped making these graphics cards for sale. If you need to set up a two- monitor system and need both monitors to be graphics capable, look into setting up two VGA monitors or a VGA monitor with an 8514 display.   838  Appendix F Command Reference  MWAV  6.0 and later—Windows Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows  MWAV  is a Windows program that can help you to detect and clean any computer viruses found in your system. This program is the Windows coun- terpart 0201620 to the MSAV program.  You cannot run MWAV from the DOS command line; you need to start it from within Windows, for example, by opening Program Manager’s File menu and choosing the Run command. For instruction on using the program, run MWAV and press F1, or choose Help from the menu.  MWAV keeps its settings information in a separate ﬁle from MSAV, so the settings you make in one program are not honored in the other program. MWAV stores its settings in the MWAV.INI ﬁle, which it creates in the main Windows directory. MSAV stores its settings in the MSAV.INI ﬁle, which it creates in either the subdirectory that contains MSAV.EXE or the one pointed to by the MSDOSDATA environment variable.  See Also  MSAV, MWAVTSR, and VSAFE  “Using the Windows Version of Microsoft Anti-Virus” in Chapter 9  MWAVTSR  6.0 and later—Windows  When Windows is running, VSAFE cannot display its messages when a forbidden system activity arises. MWAVTSR provides a channel through which VSAFE can contact you if it needs your attention while Windows is running. If you are using both Windows and VSAFE, you should add MWAVTSR to your startup group or include it in the LOAD= line in WIN.INI so that it starts up automatically every time you start Windows.  You cannot run MWAVTSR from the DOS command line; you need to start it from within Windows, for example, by opening the Program Manager’s File menu and choosing the Run command.

You can deﬁne setup ﬁles that record your preferences and enable you to quickly perform different backup chores. No matter how careful you are, you should periodically back up the contents of your hard disk. This program is the Windows counterpart to the MSBACKUP program.   MWUNDEL 6.0 and later—Windows  839  You cannot run MWBACKUP from the DOS command line; you need to start it from within Windows, for example, by opening Program Manager’s File menu and choosing the Run command. For instruction on using the program, run MWBACKUP and press F1 or choose Help from the menu.  MWBACKUP keeps its settings information in a separate ﬁle from MSBACKUP, so the settings you make in one program are not honored in the other program. MWBACKUP stores its settings in the MWBACKUP.INI ﬁle, which it creates in the main Windows directory. MSBACKUP stores its settings in the MSBACKUP.INI ﬁle, which it creates in either the subdirectory that contains MSBACKUP.EXE or the one pointed to by the MSDOSDATA environment variable.  MWBACKUP and MSBACKUP can share catalog ﬁles and backup set ﬁles. If the MSDOSDATA environ- ment variable is deﬁned, both programs look for these ﬁles in the subdirectory it points to. If MSDOSDATA is not deﬁned, they create and look for these ﬁles in the subdirectory where the corresponding executable ﬁle is located.  See Also  MSBACKUP  MWUNDEL  “Understanding Microsoft Backup” in Chapter 9  6.0 and later—Windows  Microsoft Undelete for Windows  MWUNDEL  is a Windows program that enables you to recover ﬁles that you have deleted accidentally. This program is the Windows counterpart to the UNDELETE program. If you are running Windows, you should use this program in pref- erence to the DOS version. You can control various aspects of the “tracking” and “sentry” options of UNDELETE from within Windows by using MWUNDEL, but the resident portions of UNDELETE need to be loaded into memory before you start Windows.  You cannot run MWUNDEL from the DOS command line; you need to start it from within Windows, for example, by opening Program Manager’s File menu and then choosing the Run command. For instruction on using the program, run MWUNDEL and press F1 or choose Help from the menu.  MWUNDEL shares its settings ﬁle with UNDELETE. Both programs look for the UNDELETE.INI ﬁle in the subdirectory pointed to by the MSDOSDATA environment variable. If MSDOSDATA is not deﬁned, they create and look for UNDELETE.INI in the subdirectory where their executable ﬁles are located, which is C:\DOS by default.  App F  See Also  UNDELETE  “Using the Microsoft Undelete Program for Windows” in Chapter 9   840  Appendix F Command Reference  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  NLSFUNC  3.3 and later—External  NLSFUNC is a resident program that provides support for code page switching on your com- puter. If you use code pages, you usually have to load NLSFUNC. You can load NLSFUNC from your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle by adding the INSTALL= command. Do not attempt to load NLSFUNC if Windows is running on your computer.  Syntax  NLSFUNC drive:\path\COUNTRY.SYS  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\COUNTRY.SYS  The name and location of the country information ﬁle you want to use. It normally is COUNTRY.SYS, which Setup places in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. You don’t have to include this parameter if you have included the full path- name of the country ﬁle in the COUNTRY= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. If you don’t specify this parameter, either here or in the COUNTRY= command, DOS searches for  COUNTRY.SYS in the root directory of the startup drive.  Notes  ﬁle  usually COUNTRY.SYS .  tory of the current disk.  1. If you provide a drive or pathname, you also must provide the name of the information  2. If you omit the full ﬁlename, DOS searches for the ﬁle COUNTRY.SYS in the root direc-  3. After NLSFUNC is loaded, it remains active until you restart DOS. 4. You can load NLSFUNC into upper memory by using the LOADHIGH command if you have  upper memory available on your computer.  5. You can load NLSFUNC from your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle by adding the INSTALL= command. If you use INSTALL=, remember that you must include the full pathname  with the exten- sion  of the NLSFUNC.EXE ﬁle on your system. Setup places the NLSFUNC.EXE ﬁle in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default.  See Also  CHCP, COUNTRY=, DISPLAY.SYS, KEYB, MODE device CP, and PRINTER.SYS  Chapter 14, “Understanding the International Features of DOS”  NUMLOCK=  CONFIG  SYS  6.0 and later—Internal  NUMLOCK= was introduced with DOS 6. It enables you to choose the state of the NumLock key  ON or OFF  when the system starts up. If your computer toggles the NumLock key the   NUMLOCK= 6.0 and later—Internal  841  “wrong” way when you reboot, the NUMLOCK= command is just what you need. NUMLOCK= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  To have NumLock turned on  numbers on the keypad active  when you reboot your com- puter, include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle:  To have NumLock turned off  cursor keys on the keypad active  when you reboot your computer, include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle:  Syntax  NUMLOCK=ON  NUMLOCK=OFF  Notes  1. Although you may read information to the contrary, you can use NUMLOCK= anywhere in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. You don’t have to set up menus in CONFIG.SYS to use the NUMLOCK= command. In its documentation, Microsoft erroneously implied that NUMLOCK= could be used only in a menu block, and this mistake has been duplicated in virtually every description of this command since then.  2. The CMOS Setup program in certain computers has a setting for controlling the state  of NumLock as well. If your computer has such a setting, you can either use it to set NumLock or use the NUMLOCK= command. If the settings disagree, no harm is done, but the setting in CONFIG.SYS overrides the CMOS Setup because it is executed after the ROM BIOS startup routines are complete.  3. If you are using an older computer, you might ﬁnd that using the NUMLOCK= command  causes the NumLock light on your keyboard to get out of sync with the state the key is in. In the design of the original IBM PC, there was no way for the computer to tell the keyboard to toggle the lights. IBM ﬁxed this problem when it introduced the enhanced 101-key keyboard with the IBM AT. If your computer still uses the old-style interface, however, you might have to either ignore the light or avoid using the NUMLOCK= com- mand.  Examples  If your computer normally sets the NumLock key on at startup, and you want it turned off, include the following line anywhere in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: NUMLOCK=OFF  If you want DOS to ask you whether to turn off the NumLock key at startup, insert a ? into the NUMLOCK= command, like this: NUMLOCK?=OFF  When DOS processes your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, it prompts you with NUMLOCK=OFF  [Y,N]? before executing the NUMLOCK= command. Type Y to turn off the NumLock key or N to leave it on.  App F   842  Appendix F Command Reference  DR-DOS  NWCACHE  NWCACHE is a disk-caching program to speed up disk performance.

When DOS cannot ﬁnd an executable program in the current directory, it searches through each directory listed in the PATH environment variable. Executable programs are ﬁles that end in .COM, .EXE, or .BAT, and DOS searches each directory on the search path, in that order, for each type. By specifying a PATH, you can save yourself from having to enter the full path- name for each command you want to execute. The Setup program for DOS 6 places a PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle that places the C:\DOS subdirectory  or whatever install directory you speciﬁed  on your search path.  App F  Syntax  To specify an executable ﬁle search path, use the following format:  PATH  path1;path2;path3;...   846  Appendix F Command Reference  To display the current PATH, use the following format:  To clear the current PATH, use the following format:  PATH  PATH ;  Parameters and Switches  path1;path2;path3;...  Each path listed must specify a valid subdirectory that exists on your system. The current subdirectory often changes, so it is a good idea to use full, absolute pathnames—including drive letters—for each subdirectory included in your PATH statement. Separate each subdirectory from the previous one by adding a semicolon  ; .  Notes  1. If you specify more than one set of paths, the following rules apply:    The path sets must be separated by semicolons.   The order in which you list the path sets is the order DOS looks for the programs  or batch ﬁles. First, DOS searches the current directory; then DOS searches the ﬁrst path speciﬁed, then the second path speciﬁed, and so on, until the command or batch ﬁle is found.  2. The maximum length of PATH is 127 characters. This is one of the most compelling rea-  sons to use short subdirectory names whenever you can.  3. The PATH command establishes the value of an environment variable named PATH. You  can view, set, or delete the PATH by using the SET command, as well as the PATH com- mand. The PATH command is simply shorthand for SET PATH=.  4. When you type the name of a program or batch ﬁle, DOS searches the current direc- tory. If the program or batch ﬁle is not found, DOS searches each path in sequence. If the program or batch ﬁle is not found in any of the paths, DOS displays the error mes- sage Bad command or filename.  5. You can shorten PATH by using the SUBST command to substitute drive letters for deeply  nested paths. Another technique is to remove a path that is included only to start one program. Then, you can make a batch ﬁle that uses CD to change directory to that path and invokes the program, and place the batch ﬁle in a directory that is still included in PATH.  Messages  Invalid drive in search path  Warning: You speciﬁed a nonexistent drive name in one of the paths. This message appears when DOS searches for a program or batch ﬁle, not when you give the PATH command.   PAUSE 1.0 and later—Internal  847  Use PATH or SET to see the current path. If the drive temporarily is invalid because of a  JOIN or SUBST command, you can ignore this message. If you speciﬁed the wrong disk drive, issue the PATH command again and provide the complete set of directory paths that you want to use.  “Helping DOS Find Files with PATH” in Chapter 5  1.0 and later—Internal  The PAUSE command displays a Press any key to continue... message and waits for the user before continuing to execute the batch ﬁle. This command is useful if you want the user to be able to abort a batch ﬁle, using Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break, before some action is taken. You also can use PAUSE to give the user time to read a screen of messages displayed with the ECHO command.  See Also  SET  PAUSE  BATCH  FILE  Syntax  PAUSE  Notes  1. The PAUSE command simply displays the Press any key to continue... message when  it is executed. The next key you press  except Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break; see Note 2  releases the pause, and execution of the batch ﬁle continues.  2. Pressing Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break in response to the Press any key to continue... mes- sage displays the Terminate batch job  Y N ? message. Pressing Y aborts the batch ﬁle, returning you to the DOS prompt. Pressing N skips the line that was executing and con- tinues with the next line in the batch ﬁle.  3. If you are running the batch ﬁle from within a Shell program, such as DOS Shell, the  Terminate batch job  Y N ? message is not displayed. When you press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break in these circumstances, the batch ﬁle is always aborted.  4. If you want to wait for a keypress but don’t want PAUSE to display the Press any key to  continue... message, you can redirect the output of the PAUSE command to the NUL device. DOS still waits for a keypress, but no message is displayed.  5. The CHOICE command included with DOS 6 gives you much more ﬂexibility in choos- ing allowable keys and making decisions than PAUSE. If you are using DOS 6, consider using CHOICE instead of PAUSE in your batch ﬁles.  App F   848  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  One very common use for PAUSE is to give the user time to do something. For example, if you want to make certain that a ﬂoppy disk had been placed in drive B, you might include the following lines in a batch ﬁle: ECHO Insert the Working Backup disk in drive B: ECHO. ECHO Press Ctrl+Break to abort the backup, or PAUSE  When these commands are executed, the following messages are displayed: Insert the Working Backup disk in drive B:  Press Ctrl+Break to abort the backup, or Press any key to continue...  Note that the PAUSE message is anticipated in the ECHO messages. If you redirect the output from PAUSE to the NUL device, you can control all the text displayed onscreen, as shown in the following: ECHO  Insert the Working Backup disk in drive B: ECHO. ECHO  Press Ctrl+Break to abort the backup, or any ECHO  other key to update the Working Backup disk. PAUSE  >  NUL  When these commands are executed, the following messages are displayed: Insert the Working Backup disk in drive B:  Press Ctrl+Break to abort the backup, or any other key to update the Working Backup disk.  If you press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break at the pause, the following message is displayed  as long as you aren’t running this batch ﬁle from within a Shell program : Terminate batch job  Y N ?  Type Y to abort the batch ﬁle; type N to continue with the next line.  Messages  Press any key to continue...  Prompt: PAUSE displays this message any time it is executed. DOS waits for a key to be pressed before continuing execution of the batch ﬁle. Entering Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break when this message is displayed enables you to terminate the batch ﬁle rather than continuing. Terminate Batch Job  Y N ?  Prompt: When you press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break while a batch ﬁle is running, DOS displays this message. Typing Y aborts the batch ﬁle, returning you to the DOS prompt. Typing N skips the line that was executing and continues with the next line in the batch ﬁle. Note that if you run the batch ﬁle from within a Shell program, such as DOS Shell, this message isn’t displayed, and the batch ﬁle is aborted.

Disables the power-management features. You might want to use this setting  or STD  when you are running communica- tions software.  Notes  1. You must install the POWER.EXE device driver before you can run POWER from the com-  mand line. If you try to run POWER without installing the device driver, an error message appears.  See the following “Messages” section.   2. POWER.EXE is actually two ﬁles: a device driver and an executable program. The device  driver portion does all the real work. You have to load it into memory by adding a   POWER 6.0 and later—External  853  DEVICE= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle for the DOS power-management features to be enabled. After this device driver has been loaded into memory, the executable por- tion of POWER.EXE communicates with the device driver to adjust settings and display status information.  3. If you enter the POWER command without specifying a new setting, you see a status  report that summarizes the active settings and current power use in your system. On non–APM-compliant systems, POWER displays the following report: Power Management Status ----------------------- Setting = ADV:REG CPU: idle 75% of the time  If your system supports the APM speciﬁcation, a more detailed report, like the follow- ing, is displayed: Power Management Status ----------------------- Setting = ADV:REG CPU: idle 75% of time AC Line Status : OFFLINE Battery status : High Battery life  %  : 90  The computer’s ROM BIOS provides the additional information in this report. This information is not displayed on non–APM-compliant computers.  4. When you are running communications software, CPU-intensive applications, or other  applications that don’t access your hard disk very often, you might want to turn off power-management features. With an ADV:MAX setting, POWER may think your computer was idle when it was actually busy handling serial communications or recalculating a large spreadsheet. To minimize the possibility of false idle-time detection but still keep power-management features active, use a setting of ADV:MIN. To disable APM features and regain maximum performance from your computer, use a setting of OFF or STD. 5. POWER.EXE detects idle time with a variety of methods. It monitors hard disk activity, video functions, and MS-DOS service requests to determine whether your system is busy. In addition, POWER.EXE monitors the keyboard polling and application-idle inter- rupts to sense idle time in active programs. When idle time is detected, a CPU HALT instruction is executed, causing the CPU to sleep until the next hardware interrupt arrives.  The timer interrupt occurs 18.2 times per second, so the CPU sleeps for only 55 milliseconds or less.  If a busy program routinely polls the keyboard, such as communication programs often do, POWER.EXE may think your computer is idle when it isn’t. False idle detection can interfere with a program’s operation, unnecessarily slowing it down. The ADV:MAX, REG, and MIN settings control the level of keyboard polling detection that POWER.EXE uses. If you are having performance problems with an application, try turning down keyboard polling detection by using an ADV:REG setting or disabling it by using ADV:MIN.  6. Even if your system doesn’t support the APM speciﬁcation, you still may get some ben-  eﬁt from POWER.EXE. Microsoft’s testing indicates that, on the average, a 5% reduction  App F   854  Appendix F Command Reference  in power consumption can be realized by using POWER.EXE on non–APM-compliant computers. Of course, the power-management features built into your laptop might surpass this savings, in which case you are better off not using POWER.EXE at all.  Examples  Assuming the POWER.EXE device driver has been loaded from your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, entering the following command requests maximum power savings: POWER  ADV:MAX  If you want to fax some work back to the ofﬁce, you might want to turn down your power- management features to avoid interfering with your communications software.

POWER.EXE is fully compatible with Windows. If you are running Windows 3.1 on a sys-  tem with an APM-compliant ROM BIOS, you should select MS-DOS System with APM in Windows’s Setup as the type of computer you are using. When you do so, Windows can cooperate and control the power-management features supplied by POWER.EXE. On non–APM-compliant computer systems, you can use POWER.EXE without selecting a spe- cial computer type.  Examples  To load the POWER.EXE device driver and enable the ADV:REG  default  level of power manage- ment, you could add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: DEVICE=C:\DOS\POWER.EXE  If you want to enable the maximum level of power management, specify the ADV:MAX setting instead of using the default, as shown in the following line: DEVICE=C:\DOS\POWER.EXE  ADV:MAX   PRINT 2.0 and later—External  857  As long as enough upper memory is available, POWER.EXE loads high without using the DEVICEHIGH= command.

Parameters and Switches  When you ﬁrst use the PRINT command after turning on or rebooting your computer, you can specify any of the following switches:   B:bufsiz   D:device   M:maxticks  The size  in bytes  of the memory buffer to be used while the ﬁles are printing. bufsiz can be any number from 512 to 16,384. The default is 512 bytes. You don’t have to increase this value unless you have a very fast printer.  The device to be used for printing. Legal values are PRN, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4. The default is PRN. This parameter must precede any textfile included on the command line.  The maximum amount of time  in clock ticks  that PRINT uses to send characters to the printer every time PRINT gets a turn. maxtick can be any number from 1 to 255. The default is 2.  App F   858  Appendix F Command Reference   Q:maxfiles   S:timeslice   U:busyticks  The number of ﬁles that can be held in the queue for printing. maxfiles can be any number from 4 to 32. The default is 10.  The number of clock ticks allocated for PRINT. timeslice can be a number from 1 to 255. The default is 8. Increasing timeslice speeds printing and slows other tasks.  The maximum amount of time  in clock ticks  PRINT should wait for a busy or unavailable printer before releasing its timeslice. PRINT tries again the next time it gets control. busytick can be any number from 1 to 255. The default is 1.

See item 3 in the following “Notes” section.   Terminates the background printing of all ﬁles, including any ﬁle that cur- rently is printing  clears the queue .   C   P   T  Rules  1. If you do not provide a ﬁlename, DOS displays the background printing status. 2. You can specify the switches  B,  D,  M,  Q,  S, and  U only when you ﬁrst use PRINT.   If you use the  D switch, you must type this switch ﬁrst in the line. You can list the remaining ﬁve switches in any order before you specify a ﬁlename.  3. The  D switch speciﬁes the print device that you want to use  LPT1, LPT2, LPT3,  COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4 . If you omit  D the ﬁrst time you use PRINT, DOS displays the following prompt: Name of list device [PRN]: You can respond in either of two ways:    Press Enter to send the ﬁles to PRN  normally LPT1: . If LPT1: is redirected   refer to the MODE command entry earlier in this command reference , the ﬁles are rerouted.    Enter a valid DOS device name. Printing is directed to this device. If you enter a device that is not connected to your system, PRINT accepts ﬁles in the queue. The ﬁles are not processed, however, and you lose processing speed.  After you choose the print device that you want PRINT to use, you cannot change it without restarting DOS.  4. If you name a ﬁle with no switch, DOS assumes that you want to use the  P  print   switch.  5. Files print in the order in which you list their names. If you use wildcards, ﬁles are  printed in the order in which they are listed in the directory.   PRINT 2.0 and later—External  859  6. The command PRINT  C has no effect if you do not specify a ﬁlename. 7. The ﬁrst time you invoke PRINT, DOS increases in size by approximately 5,500 bytes. When you increase or decrease certain default settings, you proportionally change the size of DOS. To regain this memory space, however, you must restart DOS.  8. If you use PRINT to print ﬁles to a serial printer, you might need to conﬁgure the serial  port by using the MODE COM command.  9. PRINT expands tab characters in the ﬁles it prints the same way the TYPE command does. Also, PRINT stops printing a ﬁle when it encounters an end-of-ﬁle marker  Ctrl+Z . For these two reasons, you should print only straight ASCII ﬁles with PRINT. Any other type of ﬁle is likely to be garbled by tab expansion and truncated when it encounters a Ctrl+Z character and terminates prematurely.  Notes  1. The  B switch acts like a disk buffer. PRINT reads into memory a portion of the docu- ment to be printed. As you increase the value of bufsiz, you decrease the number of times PRINT must read the ﬁle from the disk, thereby increasing printing speed. Always use a multiple of 512  1,024, 2,048, and so on  as the value of bufsiz. The default size  512 bytes  is adequate for most printers.  2. When the default values are assumed, PRINT gets 22 percent of the computer’s time. 3. The positions of the  P,  C, and  T switches in the command line are important. Each  switch affects the ﬁle immediately preceding it in the command line, and all subsequent ﬁles, until DOS encounters another switch. The following command, for example, uses the  P switch to place the ﬁles LETTER.TXT and PROGRAM.DOC in the queue to be printed. The  C switch cancels the background printing of MYFILE.TXT and TEST.DOC: PRINT  LETTER.TXT   P  PROGRAM.DOC  MYFILE.TXT   C TEST.DOC In this example, the  P switch affects the preceding ﬁle  LETTER.TXT  and the following ﬁle  PROGRAM.DOC . Similarly, the  C switch affects the preceding ﬁle  MYFILE.TXT  and the following ﬁle  TEXT.DOC .  4. If you use the  T switch, background printing is canceled for all ﬁles in the queue,  including the ﬁle that is currently printing, and any ﬁles listed in the command line. 5. If a disk error occurs during background printing, DOS cancels the current print job  and places a disk-error message on the printout. The printer then performs a form feed, the bell rings, and DOS prints all remaining ﬁles in the queue.  App F  Messages  filename is currently being printed filename is in queue  Information: This message tells you which ﬁle is printing and names the ﬁles that are in line to be printed.

When combined with the other international utilities DOS provides, PRINTER.SYS enables you to use various international character sets with your printer. You must load PRINTER.SYS by using a DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= statement in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. Microsoft no longer distributes PRINTER.SYS with MS-DOS, but it is avail- able on the MS-DOS 6 Supplemental Disk.

Three printer code page information ﬁles are included as well: 4201.CPI, 4208.CPI, and 5202.CPI. The MODE command requires these ﬁles when it is preparing to download code page information to your printer. 2. When PRINTER.SYS is loaded, it uses about 11KB of memory. 3. Although you can have up to three printers attached to your computer, PRINTER.SYS can  support international code pages on only one of them at a time. To change to a differ- ent printer or printer port, you have to edit the DEVICE= line for PRINTER.SYS and reboot your computer.  4. You should always specify a value for hard_cp. IBM printers often use a hardware code  page of 850, but you should check your printer manual to be sure.  5. Even if you don’t own one of the printers listed in the table, your printer may be com-  patible with one of them. To ﬁnd out whether you can use PRINTER.SYS, check your printer’s documentation or call the manufacturer.  6. To print with a software code page, you must perform a number of additional steps. You use the MODE command to prepare and download code page information to your printer. After you do so, you can use MODE to select the downloaded code page, or you can load NLSFUNC and use the CHCP command to change the active code page for all your devices at once. Additionally, you might want to add the COUNTRY= command to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle to make case conversion and sort order information available.  7. DISPLAY.SYS performs a similar function for EGA, VGA, Super VGA, and LCD screens.  App F   862  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  You can add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle to set up an IBM Proprinter X24E, attached to LPT1, for use with two additional code pages.

PROMPT, like PATH, saves its settings in the DOS environment. People often use ANSI control codes in their prompt strings, in which case ANSI.SYS has to be loaded into memory from the CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Syntax  PROMPT promptstring  Parameters and Switches  promptstring  Notes  The text of the DOS command-line prompt. It can include any of the meta-strings deﬁned for use in the PROMPT command  see the following table .  1. If you do not enter the promptstring, the standard system prompt, which is equivalent  to PROMPT $N$G  C> , reappears.  2. A very popular prompt string, and the one that the Setup program for MS-DOS 6  inserts into your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle, is PROMPT $P$G  C:\DOS> . Beginning with DOS 6.0, COMMAND.COM inserts the value $P$G in PROMPT if it ﬁnds the PROMPT environment variable undeﬁned when the system starts up.  3. The new system prompt stays in effect until you restart DOS or reissue the PROMPT  command.  4. The PROMPT command establishes the value of an environment variable named PROMPT. You  can view, set, or delete the PROMPT environment variable by using the SET command, as well as the PROMPT command. The PROMPT command is simply shorthand for SET PROMPT=.   PROMPT 2.0 and later—Internal  863  5. Any text you type for promptstring becomes the new system prompt. You can include  special characters by using the meta-strings. A meta-string is a group of characters transformed into another character or group of characters. All meta-strings begin with the dollar-sign symbol  $  and have two charac- ters, including the $. The case of the characters isn’t signiﬁcant in a prompt meta- string, but it is signiﬁcant in ANSI commands. The following table contains the meta-string characters and their meanings:  Meta-String  $$  $B  $D  $G  $L  $N  $P  $Q  $T  $V  $E  $H  Example $  Tue 09-11-2001 > < C C:\DOS  = 12:19:12.45  Description Dollar sign Vertical bar  pipe  character The current date Greater-than symbol Less-than symbol The current drive letter The current drive and path, including the current directory Equal sign The current time  Note that the time is not updated as the time changes, only when a new prompt line is displayed.

When you open a DOS window within Windows, the prompt is changed to the value of the WINPMT environment variable if it has been deﬁned. If you want to have a differ- ent prompt under Windows, use the SET command to deﬁne an environment variable named WINPMT and set it equal to the prompt you want to use. For example, the line SET WINPMT=**Windows** $P$G gives you the following prompt in a DOS window within Windows: **Windows** C:\DOS> This is a handy prompt to remind you that Windows is running.  Examples  To use the current drive and path as the prompt, followed by >, use this command: PROMPT  $P$G  Assuming that your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle loads ANSI.SYS and that you have white text  fore- ground  on a blue background, the following command changes the prompt to a blinking red HI, followed by >: PROMPT  &E[5; 3 mHI$E[0; 37; 44m$G  See Also  ANSI.SYS and SET  “Changing the Command Prompt with PROMPT” in Chapter 11.  QBASIC  5.0 and later—External  QBasic is the Microsoft QuickBasic programming environment, a full-screen, interactive programming tool for writing programs in BASIC. Traditionally, all operating system soft- ware came with a simple set of programming tools. Few microcomputer users have an inter- est in these programs anymore, but it is nice that Microsoft keeps providing them free for those who want them. QBasic also is the “behind the scenes” program that EDIT and HELP require; so whether or not you actually write any BASIC programs, it’s likely that you will be running QBasic on your computer.  Syntax  QBASIC   RUN pathname   EDITOR pathname   B   G   H   NOHI   MBF  Parameters and Switches   RUN pathname  Speciﬁes the BASIC ﬁle that you want QBASIC to load into memory and run.

You cannot specify the  EDITOR parameter with the  RUN parameter.    EDITOR pathname  QCONFIG  865  Speciﬁes the ASCII ﬁle that you want QBASIC to load into the full- screen text editor  EDIT . If no drive is speciﬁed, the current drive is assumed. If no subdirectory path is speciﬁed, the current directory is assumed. Wildcards are not allowed. If you don’t specify a pathname, the editor starts without a ﬁle. You cannot specify the  RUN parameter with the  EDITOR parameter.  Speciﬁes that QBASIC should use colors more appropriate for a black- and-white  monochrome  or LCD screen.  Speciﬁes that QBASIC should use the fastest screen-updating method for a CGA monitor.

The RAMBOOST.INI ﬁle is an ASCII text ﬁle that can be edited.  RAMDRIVE.SYS  device driver   3.2 and later— External  A RAM disk is a simulated drive that uses RAM, rather than a magnetic disk, to store ﬁles. Because it has no moving parts, a RAM disk is much faster than a hard drive or ﬂoppy disk. Unfortunately, whenever you shut down or restart your computer, the contents of a RAM disk are lost. Using RAMDRIVE.SYS, you can create a RAM disk in extended, expanded, or conventional memory. You must load RAMDRIVE.SYS by adding a DEVICE= or DEVICEHIGH= statement in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  App F  Notes  CONFIG  SYS  DEVICE =  Syntax  DEVICE=drive:\path\RAMDRIVE.SYS  disksize  sectorsize  dir_entries   E  A  To load the RAMDRIVE.SYS device driver into upper memory, use the DEVICEHIGH= command to specify the placement in memory of the driver, not the RAM disk: DEVICEHIGH=drive:\path\RAMDRIVE.SYS  disksize  sectorsize  dir_entries   E   A   868  Appendix F Command Reference  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  Speciﬁes the full path to the RAMDRIVE.SYS ﬁle on your system. Setup places the RAMDRIVE.SYS ﬁle in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to RAMDRIVE.SYS isn’t speciﬁed, DOS looks for the ﬁle in the root directory of the startup drive.  Indicates the size, in kilobytes, of the RAM disk you want to create.  disksize can be from 4KB to 32,767KB.  For DOS 5, the limits were 16KB to 4,096KB.  If no disksize is speciﬁed, a 64KB RAM disk is created.  Indicates the sector size the RAM disk should use. sectorsize can be 128, 256, or 512. If this parameter is omitted, a sectorsize of 512 is assumed.  You should have a very good reason before setting sectorsize to a differ- ent value. All DOS disks use a sector size of 512, and many disk utilities fail if a different sector size is used.  To specify sectorsize, you also must specify disksize.  Speciﬁes the maximum number of root directory entries that the RAM disk can hold  in other words, the size of the root directory . dir_entries can be in the range 2 to 1024 and are rounded up to the nearest multiple that ﬁts evenly in sectorsize. Each directory entry takes 32 bytes of disk space. If this parameter is omitted, a root directory with room for 64 entries is created  four 512-byte sectors in size . To specify dir_entries, you also must specify disksize and sectorsize.  dir_entries limits only the size of the root directory, not any subdirecto- ries you create on the RAM disk. Subdirectories grow as needed to accommodate an unlimited number of directory entries.  Creates the RAM disk in extended memory. An XMS-compatible memory manager, such as HIMEM.SYS, must be available.  Creates the RAM disk in expanded memory. A LIM EMS-compatible memory manager, such as EMM386.EXE, must be available.  disksize  sectorsize  dir_entries   E   A  Notes  1. DEVICEHIGH= loads the RAMDRIVE.SYS device driver into upper memory, but the RAM  disk still is created in the memory area you have speciﬁed with the command’s parame- ters. RAMDRIVE.SYS uses about 1KB of memory for the device driver.  2. If not enough room is available in memory for the RAM disk you have speciﬁed,   RAMDRIVE.SYS decreases the size of the root directory to 16 entries and tries again. If  the RAM disk still doesn’t ﬁt, the driver aborts with an error message.  See the third item in the following “Messages” section.   3. A RAM disk runs more efﬁciently from extended memory than from the simulated  expanded memory provided by EMM386.EXE. Unless you have a hardware EMS board in your computer, always create RAM disks in extended memory.   RAMDRIVE.SYS  device driver   3.2 and later—External  869  4. Normally, you don’t want to create RAM disks in conventional memory. Although they  run efﬁciently there, they also use up memory that is required to run your application programs. This memory trade-off might be worthwhile only when you are working on a ﬂoppy-disk–only system. The increased speed from a RAM disk could be worth the loss of memory for certain operations.  5. Although RAM disks are very fast, SMARTDrive can provide similar speed increases for all your programs—not just those that use the RAM disk. For many people, com- mitting memory into a disk cache such as SMARTDRV.EXE makes more sense than creating a RAM drive. Of course, if you have a lot of RAM that you don’t use, you can always do both.  If you use a RAM disk to store data ﬁles, remember to copy them to your hard drive before shutting off your system or rebooting. Whenever you restart your computer, everything on a RAM disk is lost.  6. One popular use of a RAM disk is to store temporary ﬁles generated by programs.  When you set the TEMP and TMP environment variables to point to a RAM disk, many programs create their temporary ﬁles on the RAM disk.  See Appendix B, “DOS Environment Variables,” for a description of the DOS programs that use the TEMP envi- ronment variable.  Not only can this technique speed up your applications, but it also can eliminate the need to periodically delete temporary ﬁles that, for one reason or another, have escaped automatic deletion by their parent programs.  7. If you run Windows and set the TEMP variable to point to a RAM disk, Microsoft advises  that the RAM disk be at least 2MB  2,048KB  in size to avoid possible printing prob- lems.  8. You can load RAMDRIVE.SYS as many times as memory allows from CONFIG.SYS. Each  time you load it, another RAM disk is created. When created, a RAM disk is assigned the next available drive letter by DOS.  9. If RAMDRIVE.SYS is loaded after DBLSPACE.SYS, it receives a drive letter that follows the letters allocated by DoubleSpace. To avoid having your RAM disk drive letter change  as you create and destroy DoubleSpace drives, always place the DEVICE= line for  RAMDRIVE.SYS before the line for DBLSPACE.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  10. You can use DoubleSpace to compress a RAM disk, but the compressed volume ﬁle   CVF  that DoubleSpace creates is lost each time you reboot your computer. To keep from having to create a new CVF ﬁle each time you start up, you could clear its attrib- utes with the ATTRIB command and copy it from the RAM disk to your hard disk. Your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle could then copy the CVF ﬁle back to the RAM disk; restore the sys- tem, hidden, and read-only attributes; and mount it for you each time you reboot.  App F   870  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  Messages  For the following examples, assume that the computer you are using has 8MB of RAM, HIMEM.SYS loaded, EMM386.EXE loaded, and UMB support enabled. To create a 64KB RAM disk in conventional memory, you can load RAMDRIVE.SYS with no parameters, as shown here: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS  The DEVICEHIGH= command locates the RAMDRIVE.SYS driver in upper memory, but the RAM disk itself still is created in conventional memory. To increase the size of the RAM disk to 1MB  1,024KB  and place it in extended memory, you add the disksize and  E parameters, as the following line shows: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS  1024   E  Because other values are not speciﬁed, the sector size is 512, and the root directory has room for 64 directory entries. If you want to create a RAM disk that is about the same size as a 1.44MB 3 1 2-inch ﬂoppy disk, you can use the following line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS  1450  512  224   E  To increase the number of root directory entries to 224, you have to specify a sector size of 512, despite the fact that 512 is the default value for sector size.

RAMDrive: Insufficient memory  Error: Not enough memory was available to create the RAM drive you speciﬁed. Typically, this problem is caused by forgetting to specify the  E or  A switch, in which case RAMDRIVE.SYS attempts to create the RAM disk in conventional memory.

RECOVER is supposed to help you in these situations, but at times it is a case of a little help being worse than no help at   874  Appendix F Command Reference  all. With DOS 6, Microsoft stopped distributing RECOVER, and it’s not even available on the Supplemental Disk. If you have a copy of RECOVER on your disk, you might want to delete it to keep from running it accidentally.  Situations like the ones that RECOVER was supposed to address do arise. DOS 6.22 includes the ScanDisk utility, which can repair many of the problems that can arise on your disks. If ScanDisk can’t ﬁx the problem, or if you aren’t running DOS 6.22 when disaster strikes, reach for a good third-party utility package. The Norton Utilities, PC Tools, and the Mace Utilities are just a few of the packages that offer excellent tools to help you recover dam- aged ﬁles and disks. Any one of these packages will pay for itself many times over the ﬁrst time you lose access to your hard disk due to a runaway program overwriting your root directory.  See Also  SCANDISK  “Analyzing a Disk with SCANDISK” in Chapter 7  REM  BATCH  FILE  CONFIG  SYS  1.0 and later—Internal  You can use the REM command to insert comments into batch ﬁles or your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. Any text on the line after REM  with a few exceptions in batch ﬁles  is ignored when DOS is processing that line in the ﬁle. Using this command can be extremely handy for document- ing or temporarily “commenting out” lines in the ﬁle.  Syntax  REM comment  Parameters and Switches  comment  Notes  Can be any text. DOS truncates any line longer than 127 characters, but this usually doesn’t matter in a comment line. In batch ﬁles, comments are read by the parser, so the pipe character    and redirection symbols     should be avoided.  1. REM should be placed at the beginning of a line, with only spaces or tabs preceding it. A legal delimiter of some sort  for example, a space  needs to follow the REM so that DOS can recognize it.  2. In batch ﬁles, the pipe    and redirection symbols     should be avoided in com-  ments because the parser may see and act on them. Including a greater-than sign in a comment line may cause an empty ﬁle to be created with the next eight characters as its name.   REMOVDRV  875  3. DOS has a maximum line length of 127 characters; any line longer than that is trun- cated. Still, as long as you are not depending on the comment line being displayed, it really doesn’t matter whether DOS cuts it off. Comments are for you to read when you are working on the ﬁle, and the length of the line is really limited by your editing soft- ware, not DOS.  4. In CONFIG.SYS, you can use a semicolon rather than REM as an easier and somewhat  cleaner way to mark comments. The semicolon comment isn’t valid in batch ﬁles or versions of DOS before MS-DOS 6.  5. Blank lines can make your batch ﬁles and CONFIG.SYS ﬁle much easier to understand. DOS ignores any blank lines in these ﬁles, so you don’t need to mark them as com- ments with REM.  6. Although REM is legal at the DOS prompt, it serves no purpose. REM is useful only for  inserting comments in batch ﬁles and CONFIG.SYS.  Examples  If you want to document why a particular environment variable is being created in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle, you might include something like this: REM  I set DIRCMD here to avoid always telling DIR that I prefer my REM  filenames in lowercase letters with screen pauses. SET   DIRCMD= L  P  Or perhaps you want to “comment out” the line that loads the driver for your tape drive until the replacement driver arrives in the mail: REM  DEVICE=C:\DOS\TAPE\SQ55.SYS  You also could use a semicolon to comment out the preceding line, like this: ;DEVICE=C:\DOS\TAPE\SQ55.SYS  Chapter 16, “Understanding Batch Files,” and Chapter 19, “Conﬁguring Your Computer”  App F  REMOVDRV deletes the Stacker stacvol ﬁle and all the data from the speciﬁed Stacker drive.

Wildcards are allowed; if they are used, they are ﬁlled in with the corresponding charac- ters from old_name. This parameter is required.  Notes  1. REN  or the long form, RENAME  changes the name of a ﬁle on the disk. The command  does not rename directories. You can use the MOVE command to rename a directory. 2. Because you are renaming an established disk ﬁle, the ﬁle’s drive or path designation  goes with the old name so that DOS knows which ﬁle to rename. 3. Wildcard characters are acceptable in either the old or new name.

You must provide the name of the drive that holds the backup ﬁles. If the current disk is  to receive the restored ﬁles, you do not have to specify the destination drive.  2. If you do not name a path, RESTORE uses the current directory of the receiving disk. 3. If you do not provide a ﬁlename, RESTORE restores all backup ﬁles from the directory.  Omitting the ﬁlename is the same as using *.*.  4. RESTORE prompts you to insert the backup disks in order. If you insert a disk out of  order, RESTORE prompts you to insert the correct disk.  5. Do not combine the  B,  A, and  N switches in the same RESTORE command. 6. Be cautious when you restore ﬁles that were backed up while an ASSIGN, SUBST, or JOIN  command was in effect. When you use RESTORE, clear any existing APPEND, ASSIGN, SUBST, or JOIN commands. Do not use RESTORE  M or RESTORE  N while APPEND  X is in effect. RESTORE attempts to search the directories for modiﬁed or missing ﬁles. APPEND tricks RESTORE into ﬁnding ﬁles in the paths speciﬁed to the APPEND command. RESTORE may then restore ﬁles that should not be restored, and not restore ﬁles that should be restored. To disable APPEND, issue the APPEND ; command.  7. RESTORE cannot restore DOS system ﬁles  for example, IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS  to the  appropriate positions in the ﬁle structure so that the disk is bootable.  Notes  BACKUP and RESTORE in DOS 3.3 and later are radically different from the corresponding commands in previous versions. These commands place all backed-up ﬁles in one larger ﬁle and maintain a separate information ﬁle on the same disk. In DOS 3.3 and later, RESTORE handles the new and old backup-ﬁle formats, which means that these newer versions of RESTORE can restore backups created by any version of BACKUP.

Speciﬁes the disk drive containing the undo disk that ScanDisk previously created. The colon following the drive letter is optional.  Requests that ScanDisk check all local disk drives. If you specify this switch, you should not include any drive: parameters.  Requests that ScanDisk check the drive for errors but not repair any errors it ﬁnds. You must specify this parameter if you want to run ScanDisk while other programs are running, such as Windows. You can’t combine this parameter with the  AUTOFIX,  NOSAVE, or  CUSTOM parameters.  Requests that ScanDisk ﬁx any errors it ﬁnds without prompting you ﬁrst. Any lost clusters that are found are saved as ﬁles in the root directory of the drive. If you specify the  NOSAVE parameter with  AUTOFIX, any lost clusters are deleted. You can’t combine this parameter with the  CHECKONLY or  CUSTOM parameters.  Requests that ScanDisk delete any lost clusters it ﬁnds on the disk. You can use this parameter only if you also specify the  AUTOFIX parameter.  Requests that ScanDisk follow the settings in the [CUSTOM] section of the SCANDISK.INI ﬁle. If you intend to run ScanDisk from a batch ﬁle, you might want to use this parameter. For information about setting options in the SCANDISK.INI ﬁle, read the comments included in the ﬁle itself. You can’t combine this parameter with the  AUTOFIX,  NOSAVE, or  CHECKONLY parameters.  Requests that ScanDisk automatically perform a surface scan after checking the disk for errors. Surface scans can take time, but they do verify that all the data on your disk is error free and readable.  Conﬁgures ScanDisk to use display colors more appropriate for a mono- chrome monitor or LCD screen.  Prevents ScanDisk from displaying a full-screen summary after scanning each drive.  App F  Requests that ScanDisk check all ﬁles speciﬁed with the pathname parame- ter to see how fragmented they are. You can’t specify any other parameters except pathname when you are requesting a fragmentation report.  Requests that ScanDisk reverse the changes it made to your disk. The drive speciﬁed with this parameter must be the drive containing the undo disk that ScanDisk created. Note that you should not undo the changes ScanDisk made if you have made any changes to the disk since ﬁxing the errors.   886  Appendix F Command Reference  Exit Codes  ERRORLEVEL Value 0 1 2 3 4 254 255  Meaning ScanDisk found no errors Command-line syntax error Terminated due to an internal error or lack of memory ScanDisk halted by user during integrity checks ScanDisk halted by user during surface scan ScanDisk found errors, but they were all corrected ScanDisk found errors, and they were not all corrected  Notes  1. If you enter SCANDISK with no parameters, ScanDisk scans the current drive. 2. Normally, if any errors are found, a dialog box appears with information explaining  what the error is. You can choose to have ScanDisk ﬁx the error or leave it alone. If you have speciﬁed the  AUTOFIX parameter, these dialog boxes are skipped.  3. After the disk has been checked for errors in its logical structure, ScanDisk asks  whether you want to perform a surface scan. If you have speciﬁed the  SURFACE parame- ter, the surface scan takes place automatically. If you have speciﬁed the  CHECKONLY para- meter, no surface scan is done.  4. ScanDisk can ﬁnd and repair errors on most hard disk drives, ﬂoppy disk drives,  DoubleSpace drives, RAM disk drives, and memory card drives.  5. ScanDisk can check only local disk drives. Do not attempt to run ScanDisk on any net-  work, CD-ROM, or Interlnk drives attached to your system. You also shouldn’t run ScanDisk on any alias drives created by the ASSIGN, JOIN, or SUBST commands.  6. If you try to run ScanDisk when other programs are running, ScanDisk refuses to ﬁx any problems it encounters because the other programs might try to access the disk while ScanDisk is working, and more serious problems could be created. If Windows is running and you try to start ScanDisk, you see the message shown in the third item in the following “Messages” section. If you run ScanDisk with the  CHECKONLY parameter, it checks your disks for errors while other software, such as Windows, is running. If ScanDisk ﬁnds any errors, quit all your active programs, including Windows, and run ScanDisk again. In multitasking sit- uations, ScanDisk might ﬁnd errors when none really exist. By running ScanDisk again with no outside interference, you can ﬁnd out for sure.  7. If you ask ScanDisk to check a mounted or unmounted DoubleSpace drive, it asks  whether it should ﬁrst check the host drive for errors. Normally, you should answer Yes. It is best to ﬁx the host drive and then the DoubleSpace volume if errors exist in either of them. Answer No only if you have just ﬁnished checking the host drive and are sure that no errors exist.   SCANDISK 6.22—External  887  8. After ScanDisk repairs errors on a drive, it asks whether you want to create an undo  disk. It is usually a good idea to make an undo disk. You must have a blank, formatted ﬂoppy disk that you can place in drive A or B for the undo information to be written to. After you have exited ScanDisk, try not to write anything to the disk until you are sure that you don’t want to undo the changes ScanDisk has made. Do not undo changes after writing to the disk; otherwise, serious damage could result.  9. ScanDisk can ﬁnd and repair the following types of problems on your drives:    Bad sectors on the disk   Boot sector errors   Crosslinked ﬁles   Directory tree structural errors   DoubleSpace compression structure errors   DoubleSpace volume ﬁle allocation errors   DoubleSpace volume header structure errors   DoubleSpace volume signature errors   File allocation table  FAT  errors   Lost clusters  10. You can customize many of ScanDisk’s settings by editing the SCANDISK.INI ﬁle. Setup  places this ﬁle in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. By setting the features you want to use in SCANDISK.INI and using the  CUSTOM parameter, you can automate a ScanDisk ses- sion and run it all from a batch ﬁle. For instructions on editing the SCANDISK.INI ﬁle, see the comments included in the SCANDISK.INI ﬁle itself.  Examples  To scan drives C and D for errors, you enter the following command: SCANDISK  C:  D:  If you want to perform a surface scan as well, and not be prompted about ﬁxing errors, you include the  SURFACE and  AUTOFIX options as follows: SCANDISK  C:  D:   AUTOFIX   SURFACE  If Windows is running, you have to do the surface scan later and for now specify the  CHECKONLY parameter, as in the following: SCANDISK  C:  D:   CHECKONLY  To ﬁnd out if it is time to run DEFRAG, you can check on the fragmentation level of the ﬁles in your correspondence subdirectory, like this: SCANDISK  C:\LETTERS\*.*   FRAGMENT  App F   888  Appendix F Command Reference  Messages  Invalid switch: parameter  Error: The parameter you speciﬁed is unknown to ScanDisk.

Starting with DOS 6.0, you can use the SET command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. MS-DOS uses several environment variables to control different aspects  of its operation.  2.0 and later—Internal  To display all the variables deﬁned in the environment, use the following format:  To add or replace an environment variable, use the following format: SET name=string  Parameters and Switches  name  string  The string that you want to add to the environment. DOS converts these char- acters to uppercase before storing the variable in the environment.  The text that you want associated with name. string is stored in the environment exactly as you enter it—with upper- and lowercase characters and including any spaces you specify.  1. The environment is an area of memory that DOS sets aside to store a series of text strings in the form name=string. The name portion is converted to uppercase before being stored in memory, but the string portion is stored as is.   SET 2.0 and later—Internal  895  2. If SET is executed with no parameters, the current contents of the DOS environment are displayed.  Don’t use this form of the SET command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  To display the value of a single environment variable, pipe the output from SET through the FIND ﬁlter.  See the following “Examples” section.   3. Entering SET with the name of the variable and an equal sign but no string deletes the speciﬁed variable from the environment. Note that if no variable with the name you’ve speciﬁed is found, nothing happens, and no error message is displayed.  4. When SET is executed with both name and string parameters, DOS searches the current  environment looking for a variable that matches name. If a match is found, DOS replaces the variable with the new value speciﬁed in string. If no match is found, a new variable is deﬁned in the current environment.  5. The total length of an environment variable, including the name and equal sign, cannot  exceed the DOS 127-character limit. When you use SET to create environment vari- ables, the limit is actually 123 because the SET command itself uses 3 characters and a space.  6. Spaces are legal in both the name and string portion of an environment variable. In  fact, spaces are not ignored when searching for environment variables; so any trailing spaces you include after the name, but before the equal sign, become a signiﬁcant por- tion of that variable’s name. Keep this point in mind when you deﬁne new environment variables.  7. Avoid using redirection symbols   , and   and equal signs  =  in environment vari-  ables. Although you can use them in some cases, they can cause strange, hard-to-predict side effects when you use these variables in a batch ﬁle.  8. The DOS environment is limited to the size speciﬁed by the  E:size parameter speci- ﬁed in the SHELL= statement that names the command interpreter  usually COMMAND.COM  in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. If you haven’t speciﬁed an  E:size parameter, it defaults to 256 characters. When a program is run, it is passed a copy of the current environment that has been shrunk to the smallest multiple of 16, which is big enough to hold all the vari- ables currently deﬁned. One annoying side effect of this behavior is that, if you normally run DOS from a Shell program, you will never have much environment space available—no matter how big you make it in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. To avoid the Out of environment space error mes- sages, you might have to deﬁne a DUMMY variable that you can delete from a batch ﬁle whenever you need more environment space.  See the following “Examples” section.  9. Several DOS commands use the environment to store their current values. PATH and  PROMPT both store their settings in the environment. If you are running APPEND with the  E parameter, it stores its settings in the environment as well.  10. DOS deﬁnes a number of environment variables when you start up your computer, and  certain commands modify their behavior if certain variables are deﬁned. For more information about the environment variables DOS uses, refer to Appendix B, “DOS Environment Variables.”  App F   896  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  To display the contents of the current DOS environment, enter SET with no parameters, as shown here: SET  A series of deﬁnitions similar to the following is then displayed on your screen: CONFIG=WIN COMSPEC=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM MOUSE=C:\DOS TEMP=C:\TEMP TMP=C:\TEMP DIRCMD= L PATH=C:\BAT;C:\NORTON;C:\DOS;C:\UTIL PROMPT=*Windows* $p$g windir=d:\win  You can tell many interesting things from this list. First of all, the computer uses a startup menu, and the conﬁguration that was chosen is named WIN  CONFIG=WIN . Also, notice that the WINDIR environment variable is shown in lowercase. Microsoft Windows inserts this vari- able into the environment as a ﬂag to indicate that it is active. Inserting it in lowercase is a trick that prevents you from changing or deleting it with the SET command.  If you want to see how a particular environment variable is deﬁned, pipe the output of the SET command through the FIND ﬁlter, like this: SET    FIND  “COMSPEC”  Only the lines that contain “COMSPEC” are displayed. Note that FIND is case sensitive by default, so make sure that you enter the name of the variable you are looking for in all uppercase  or specify the  I switch .  To change the defaults for the DIR command to lowercase ﬁlenames   L  ﬁve columns wide   W , sorted by date with directories ﬁrst   OGD , you can deﬁne  or replace  the DIRCMD envi- ronment variable by using the following SET command: SET  DIRCMD= L   W   OGD  Note that you can’t include any spaces before the equal sign; otherwise, a new variable  DIRCMD   that the DIR command does not recognize is deﬁned. To delete the DIRCMD variable entirely and let DIR use its built-in defaults, use the following command. SET  DIRCMD=  If you want to make sure that an environment variable you deﬁne in a batch ﬁle was success- fully created, add an IF command after the SET command that deﬁnes the new variable: SET  NEWVAR=Do we have space for this? IF  “%NEWVAR%”==””  GOTO  OUT_OF_SPACE  One technique to help you avoid Out of environment space error messages when you run batch ﬁles from a Shell program is to deﬁne a DUMMY variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle to simply take up space: SET  DUMMY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   SETUP  Stacker   897  When you need space in the environment, simply delete the DUMMY variable, as follows, before you deﬁne any new variables that your batch ﬁle needs: SET  DUMMY= SET  NEWVAR=Now we have space for this  When your batch ﬁle terminates, returning you to your Shell program, the copy of the envi- ronment that the batch ﬁle was using is discarded. Because it is being thrown away, there is no reason to restore the DUMMY variable before the batch ﬁle ends.  If you might run this batch ﬁle when your Shell program is not running, you should reset the DUMMY variable and delete the NEWVAR variable before exiting the batch ﬁle like this: SET  NEWVAR= SET  DUMMY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  Otherwise, the next time you need the DUMMY variable, it might not be there.  Messages  Out of environment space  Error: You see this message if the environment is not large enough to hold the string you want to add with the PATH, PROMPT, or SET command. To increase the size of the environ- ment, use the  E:size parameter in the SHELL= statement in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. Syntax error  Error: SET displays a syntax error message if you forget to include the equal sign. This error most often happens after you have been using the PATH and PROMPT commands, which get you out of the habit of including an equal sign between the variable name and its value.

App F   898  Appendix F Command Reference  SETVER  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  5.0 and later—External When programmers write software, they often add code to check the version of DOS that is running. To be on the safe side, they may prevent their program from running if the prelim- inary check reveals the presence of a version of DOS that they didn’t test. In many cases, this paranoia is unnecessary, and lying to the program about which version of DOS is run- ning enables the software to operate safely. The SETVER.EXE device driver maintains in mem- ory a version table that tells it exactly which programs to lie to and what version of DOS to tell the program it is running. When you run SETVER from the command line, you can view, add, change, or delete entries in SETVER.EXE’s version table. These changes take effect the next time SETVER.EXE is loaded into memory.  Syntax  SETVER  drive:\path filename n.nn  SETVER  drive:\path filename  DELETE   D   QUIET  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path  filename  n.nn   DELETE   D   QUIET  Speciﬁes the drive and path to the SETVER.EXE ﬁle. Setup places the SETVER.EXE ﬁle in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If drive:\path is not speciﬁed, SETVER searches the current directory and along the DOS PATH to ﬁnd the SETVER.EXE ﬁle. You usually can omit this parameter.  Speciﬁes the full name of the program you want SETVER to locate in the ver- sion table. Include the ﬁlename and extension, but do not include any path information. No default extensions are assumed, and wildcards are not allowed. If you include this parameter, you also must include either an n.nn,  DELETE, or  D parameter.  Speciﬁes the DOS version number that SETVER.EXE reports to the program speciﬁed by the filename parameter. Valid entries are in the range 2.11 to 9.99. You are required to enter the period delimiting the major and minor version numbers, and you should always enter the value with two decimal places  that is, 2.00, not 2.0 or 2 . If you specify this parameter, you cannot specify the  DELETE,  D, or  QUIET parameters.  Deletes the version table entry for the program ﬁle speciﬁed by filename. If you specify  DELETE, you cannot specify the n.nn parameter.  Same as  DELETE.  Suppresses the two-line successful update message that appears after an entry is deleted from the version table.

If you enter SETVER without any parameters, DOS displays all entries it comes across  from the version table contained in the ﬁrst copy of SETVER.EXE. DOS searches the cur- rent directory for the SETVER.EXE ﬁle, followed by all the subdirectories speciﬁed in your DOS PATH. If you enter SETVER drive:\path, the entries in the version table con- tained in the drive:\path\SETVER.EXE ﬁle are displayed. In this case, no other directo- ries are searched if SETVER.EXE isn’t found in the drive:\path subdirectory.  2. Microsoft ships SETVER.EXE with a version table that lists programs known to work  safely with MS-DOS 6, but which have to be fooled in order to run.

If you look through the version table provided by Microsoft, you see that WINWORD.EXE and EXCEL.EXE are listed as requiring DOS version 4.10. However, Word for Windows 2.0 and Excel 4.0 can run under DOS 6.22 without SETVER. These entries are for older versions of these programs. If your Windows software is up to date, you don’t have to worry about using SETVER to fool these two programs.  In the version table, you also see entries for the DOS utilities that were not distributed with DOS 6. When you use the DOS 5 versions of these utilities, they have to be included in the version table for SETVER; otherwise, they do not run. Instead, an Incorrect DOS version message is displayed. If you install updated versions of these utilities with the DOS 6 Supplemental Disk Setup program, their version table entries are deleted.  3. Do not specify the DOS version number with the ﬁlename if you are trying to delete an entry in the version table. Doing so causes this error message to be displayed: Too many command line parameters.  Read more about this message in the following “Messages” section.   4. Don’t add a program to the SETVER.EXE version table unless you are sure that it can run  safely with DOS 6. There is a chance that an incompatible program might appear to run and still cause system instabilities or data loss. This is the reason Microsoft displays the WARNING paragraph whenever you add or update an entry in the version table.  Read more about this message in the following “Messages” section.  To be safe, contact the manufacturer of the software program in question to ﬁnd out whether the version you have can be run safely under DOS 6.  5. Any changes you make to the version table with SETVER are written to the SETVER.EXE ﬁle on disk, not to the device driver in memory. These changes do not take effect until you reload the SETVER.EXE device driver into memory by restarting your computer.   SETVER 5.0 and later—External  901  6. Specify the drive and path to the SETVER.EXE ﬁle you want to update and not the drive and path to the program you are looking for in the version table. If you don’t specify the drive and path correctly, SETVER usually fails to ﬁnd SETVER.EXE, and an error mes- sage is displayed  see the second item in the following “Messages” section . Normally, SETVER.EXE is located on your DOS PATH, and you can omit the drive:\path parameter to avoid this confusing syntax.  7. Remember to specify only the ﬁlename  with extension  of the program ﬁle you want to  add, update, or delete from the SETVER version table. No path information is stored in the table, so only the ﬁlename is needed to locate the entry. The extension is included in the table, so you must specify it as well. No default extensions are assumed, and wild- cards are not allowed.  8. Device drivers, as well as executable programs, can be included in the version table. If SETVER.EXE is already in memory when the device driver loads in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, SETVER.EXE can lie to it about the version of DOS that is running.  Examples  To display the contents of the version table in the SETVER.EXE ﬁle located on your DOS PATH, enter SETVER on the command line as follows: SETVER  You don’t use the METRO.EXE program, and you want to delete the entry from the version table. To do so, enter the following command: SETVER  METRO.EXE   DELETE  You can abbreviate the  DELETE switch as  D if you want to. To add METRO.EXE back into the version table and restore its setting to DOS 3.31, you enter the following command: SETVER  METRO.EXE  3.31  If all goes well, you see the WARNING paragraph.

Setup places the SETVER.EXE ﬁle in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to SETVER.EXE isn’t speciﬁed, DOS looks for the ﬁle in the root directory of the startup drive.  1. Microsoft ships SETVER.EXE with a version table that lists programs known to work  safely with MS-DOS 6, but which need to be fooled in order to run. You can add or subtract programs from the version table by running SETVER from the command line.  To activate any changes you make, you must reboot your computer.

If you look through the version table provided by Microsoft, you see that WINWORD.EXE and EXCEL.EXE are listed as requiring DOS version 4.10. However, Word for Windows 2.0 and Excel 4.0 can run under DOS 6.22 without SETVER. These entries are for older versions of these programs. If your Windows software is up-to-date, you don’t have to worry about using SETVER to fool these two programs.  In the version table, you also see entries for the DOS utilities that were not distributed with DOS 6. When you use the DOS 5 versions of these utilities, they have to be included in the version table for SETVER; otherwise, they do not run. Instead, an Incorrect DOS version message is displayed. If you install updated versions of these utilities with the DOS 6 Supplemental Disk Setup program, their version table entries are deleted.  2. If upper memory is available on your computer, SETVER.EXE can be loaded there with the DEVICEHIGH= command. SETVER.EXE requires about 500 bytes of memory with its original version table.  3. The Setup program for DOS 6 automatically includes a DEVICE= line loading  SETVER.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. You might want to look over the contents of  the version table to see whether you are using any of the programs listed in it. If you are not using any of the programs and the rest of your software is happy running under DOS 6, you can safely delete the SETVER.EXE device driver from your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  4. Besides lying to programs, SETVER.EXE can also lie to device drivers. Just make sure that  SETVER.EXE is loaded before the device driver loads and that the name of that device driver is included in the version table.  App F   906  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  To load the DOS version table driver into memory, include the following line in your CON- FIG.SYS ﬁle: DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE  This line assumes that the SETVER.EXE ﬁle is in the C:\DOS subdirectory. If your computer has upper memory available, you might want to load SETVER.EXE into upper memory by using the following command: DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE  Messages  Version table is corrupt  Error: The version table stored within SETVER.EXE has become damaged. You must delete the damaged ﬁle and replace it with a fresh copy from your MS-DOS 6 distribution disks. SETVER.EXE is compressed on the distribution disks, so you must use the EXPAND command to expand it before you can use it.  See Also  DEVICE=, DEVICEHIGH=, and SETVER  “Setting the Version with SETVER” in Chapter 10  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  SHARE  3.0 and later—External The SHARE program enables DOS support for ﬁle and record locking. When you run SHARE, it remains resident in memory, becoming a part of DOS. If you use any multitasking soft- ware, such as Microsoft Windows, you should run SHARE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle. You can load SHARE into upper memory by using the LOADHIGH command on systems that have upper memory available.  Syntax  SHARE  F:name_space   L:numlocks  Parameters and Switches   F:name_space   L:numlocks  The amount of memory space in bytes to use for ﬁle sharing. The default is 2,048.  The maximum number of ﬁle record locks that are available to pro- grams. The default is 20.  Rules  and written.  1. When SHARE is loaded, DOS checks for ﬁle and record locks as each ﬁle is opened, read,   SHELL= 2.0 and later—Internal  907  2. SHARE normally enlarges DOS by approximately 6,192 bytes in DOS 5.0 and approxi-  mately 5,248 bytes in DOS 6.0. If the number of locks   L switch  or memory space   F switch  increases or decreases, DOS also increases or decreases proportionately. You can load SHARE into upper memory by using the LOADHIGH command.  3. The only way to remove SHARE is to restart DOS. 4. In DOS 4.0, use SHARE if your hard disk is formatted with partitions larger than 32MB.  SHARE is not required to use large partitions in DOS 5.0 and later versions.  5. You can load SHARE by using INSTALL= in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle  DOS 4.0 and later ver-  sions .  6. You should be running SHARE if you use any multitasking software on your computer. In  a multitasking environment, two programs might attempt to update the same ﬁle. If that happens, data can be lost. Examples of multitasking environments include the DOS Shell’s Task Swapper, Microsoft Windows, and DESQview.  Notes  1. Use SHARE when two or more programs or processes share a computer’s ﬁles. After  SHARE is loaded, DOS checks each ﬁle for locks whenever the ﬁle is opened, read, or written. If a ﬁle is open for exclusive use, an error message results from subsequent attempts to open the ﬁle. If one program locks a portion of a ﬁle, an error message results if another program tries to read or write the locked portion.  2. SHARE is most effective when all ﬁle-sharing programs can handle the DOS functions for  locking ﬁles and records  DOS 3.0 and later versions . SHARE is either partially or com- pletely ineffective with programs that do not use the DOS ﬁle- and record-locking fea- tures.  3. SHARE affects two or more programs running on the same computer, not two or more computers using the same ﬁle  networked computers . For networks, record- and ﬁle- locking are made possible by software provided with the network.  4. You must use SHARE if you use DOS 4.0 or 4.01 and if your hard disk is formatted larger  than 32MB. For convenience, you can use INSTALL= in the CONFIG.SYS ﬁle to activate SHARE. In the CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, for example, the following command activates SHARE if SHARE.EXE is located in the \DOS subdirectory of drive C: INSTALL=C:\DOS\SHARE.EXE  App F  See Also  INSTALL= and LOADHIGH  SHELL=  CONFIG  SYS  2.0 and later—Internal You use SHELL= to specify the name and location of the command interpreter that MS-DOS should use. Normally, you use COMMAND.COM, but other third-party shells, such as 4DOS and NDOS, can use SHELL= to gain control of the command line. Another common use of the   908  Appendix F Command Reference  SHELL= command is to change the size of the environment. SHELL= can be used only in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Syntax  SHELL=drive:\path\filename parameters  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  The drive and path to the command interpreter must be speciﬁed here if the command interpreter isn’t located in the root directory of the startup drive.

For the parameters and switches that COMMAND.COM uses, see the description for COMMAND earlier in this command reference.   filename  parameters  Notes  1. Be careful when you experiment with the SHELL= command and be sure that you have a bootable ﬂoppy disk handy. If you set something incorrectly, chances are you either will have to reboot from a ﬂoppy disk or perform a “clean boot” by pressing F5.  2. If no SHELL= command exists in CONFIG.SYS, DOS attempts to load COMMAND.COM from  the root directory of the startup drive. If COMMAND.COM cannot be found or is from a dif- ferent version of DOS, an error message is displayed  see the following “Messages” sec- tion . When you receive this error message, you must either enter the full pathname of a valid copy of COMMAND.COM or reboot the computer from a bootable ﬂoppy disk.  3. Do not confuse the SHELL= command with the DOSSHELL program. SHELL= is a  CONFIG.SYS command that designates the program to be used as the command-line interface to MS-DOS. DOSSHELL is a program that provides a graphical interface from which you can operate your computer if you choose. The DOSSHELL program and SHELL= command have nothing to do with each other.  4. MemMaker “comments out” the SHELL= line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle if the SHELL= line speciﬁes a command interpreter other than COMMAND.COM. If you are using a third-party shell program, be sure that COMMAND.COM is in the root directory of the startup drive before you run MemMaker. After MemMaker is done, you must manually “uncom- ment” the SHELL= line that loads your command-line interpreter to restore the use of your third-party shell.  5. Many third-party shell programs do not require the  P switch to tell them that they should install themselves permanently in memory. Instead, they look for a valid envi- ronment. If one is present, they assume that they have already been run, do not install   SHELL= 2.0 and later—Internal  909  themselves permanently, and do not execute the AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle. In DOS 6, an envi- ronment already may be present when the shell programs are loaded from the SHELL= line in CONFIG.SYS, which can lead to problems. If you ﬁnd yourself in the situation just described, try including the  P switch on the SHELL= line that loads your command-line interpreter. Also, you should contact the manufacturer of your shell program to see whether an upgrade that is more compatible with MS-DOS 6 is available.  Examples  The setup program for DOS 6 may insert a SHELL= line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle that looks something like this: SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM  C:\DOS\   E:512   P  It sets the command interpreter to COMMAND.COM, located in the C:\DOS subdirectory, with a reload path of C:\DOS and an environment size of 512 bytes. The ﬁnal  P switch tells COM- MAND.COM to remain in memory permanently. Never specify the  P switch for COMMAND.COM except in the SHELL= line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Messages  Bad or missing Command Interpreter Enter correct name of Command Interpreter  eg, C:\COMMAND.COM   Error: If the SHELL= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle does not point to a valid command interpreter, and the copy of COMMAND.COM in the root directory of your startup drive is miss- ing or invalid, this message is displayed. To continue, you have to enter the full path to a valid  DOS 6  copy of COMMAND.COM so that DOS can load it into memory. DOS has already checked the copy of COMMAND.COM in your root directory, so entering C:\COMMAND.COM as sug- gested in the error message usually does not work. You can try entering C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM because Setup places a copy of COMMAND.COM in the subdirectory in which DOS was installed. If a valid copy of COMMAND.COM can’t be found, you must reboot from a ﬂoppy disk.  Even if you locate a valid copy of COMMAND.COM and load it into memory, this copy of  COMMAND.COM is only temporary; so typing EXIT brings this error message right back onscreen. Also, your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle is not executed by temporary copies of COMMAND.COM, so none of the settings or resident software you typically use will be available. Use the COPY command to transfer a new copy of COMMAND.COM to the root directory of your startup disk  usually C:\  and reboot by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del to set things back to the way they should be.  App F  See Also  COMMAND  “Using the SHELL Command” in Chapter 19   910  Appendix F Command Reference  SHIFT  BATCH  FILE  2.0 and later—Internal The SHIFT command shifts a batch ﬁle’s command-line parameters one position to the left. You have to use the SHIFT command if your batch ﬁle requires more than nine parameters. SHIFT also is handy for batch ﬁles that repeat an operation for each command-line parame- ter. SHIFT is useful only when used in a batch ﬁle.  Syntax  SHIFT  Notes  See Also  SIZER  1. When you use SHIFT, DOS moves the command-line parameters one position to the left. That is, the parameter %1 becomes %0, %2 becomes %1, %3 becomes %2, and so on. 2. DOS discards the former ﬁrst parameter  %0 . Any parameter shifted off the left end is  gone for good.  3. DOS shifts parameter 10, if it exists, into %9, parameter 11 into parameter 10, and so on. Using SHIFT is the only way to access more than nine command-line parameters from within a batch ﬁle.  “Moving Parameters with SHIFT” in Chapter 16   see MEMMAKER   MemMaker uses the SIZER program to help it optimize memory use on your computer. MemMaker requires this program while optimizing your system, but it is not necessary at any other time. You cannot use this program yourself. SIZER aborts if MemMaker  and pos- sibly CHKSTATE.SYS  is not in control when it is run, displaying the following message: SIZER.EXE is used by MemMaker during the memory-optimization process and is not intended to be started from the command prompt.  Very few details about SIZER’s operation are documented. When MemMaker is optimizing, it adds a SIZER.EXE command to the beginning of every command that loads device drivers or resident programs in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁles. Load size information about these drivers and programs is written to the MEMMAKER.STS ﬁle by SIZER. When opti- mization is complete, MemMaker removes all references to the SIZER program from your startup ﬁles.  See Also  CHKSTATE.SYS and MEMMAKER   SMARTDRV 6.0 and later—External  911  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  SMARTDRV  6.0 and later—External  When used from the command line, SMARTDRV loads or conﬁgures SMARTDrive, a disk- caching utility that can speed disk operations signiﬁcantly. The ﬁrst time you run SMARTDRV, it loads itself into memory  upper memory if space is available  and establishes the disk cache. To unload SMARTDRV from memory, you have to reboot your computer.  Syntax  To start SMARTDrive from your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle or from a command prompt, use the fol- lowing format: SMARTDRV  X  drive ± ... initsize  winsize   U   C   R   F   N   V   Q   S  L   E:esize   B:bsize  After SMARTDrive is running, use the following format: SMARTDRV drive +- ...  C   R   Q   S  With DOS version 6.22, you also can use the  X,  F, and  N parameters after SMARTDrive is running: SMARTDRV  X  drive +- ...

You can then enable or disable individual drives by using the drive ± parameter.  Speciﬁes one or more drives for which you want to enable or disable disk caching. drive enables read caching and disables write caching. drive+ enables read and write caching. drive- disables caching.  If you start SMARTDrive but do not specify a drive, ﬂoppy and Interlnk drives are read cached only; hard drives are read and write cached; and CD-ROM, network, compressed, and Microsoft Flash memory card drives are not cached.  CD-ROM drives are read cached by default.  initsize  Speciﬁes the size  in kilobytes  of the cache when SMARTDrive starts. The following table shows the default values for this parameter:  App F  Extended Memory Up to 1MB Up to 2MB Up to 4MB Up to 6MB More than 6MB  initsize All 1024KB 1024KB 2048KB 2048KB  winsize 0  no caching  256KB 512KB 1024KB 2048KB   912  Appendix F Command Reference  winsize  Speciﬁes the size  in kilobytes  by which SMARTDrive reduces its cache when Microsoft Windows starts, freeing that memory for Windows to use. When you quit Windows, that memory is returned to SMARTDrive and defaults to the values listed in the preceding table. If winsize is larger than initsize, SMARTDrive acts as though the two parameters were the same.  Speciﬁes that you do not want SMARTDrive to load the CD-ROM caching module. If you specify this switch, SMARTDrive cannot cache any CD-ROM drives. If you don’t specify  U, you can enable or disable CD-ROM caching at any time by using the drive ± parameter.  Clears SMARTDrive by writing all write buffers to disk.  Resets SMARTDrive by clearing all caches and restarting SMARTDrive.  Writes cached data to the disk after each command ﬁnishes, before the DOS command prompt reappears. This is the default behavior.  Writes cached data to the disk whenever the system is idle. To ensure that all data is written to disk, use the  C  Clear  switch.   Not DOS 6.22  Forces “verbose” mode, so status messages appear when SMARTDrive starts.

Before you turn off or reset your computer, you must perform a SMARTDRV  C operation to guarantee that no data is lost from SMARTDrive’s write buffers. SMARTDrive per- forms the operation automatically if you press Ctrl+Alt+Del. SMARTDrive now ﬂushes all write buffers to disk before allowing COMMAND.COM to dis- play the DOS command-line prompt. As long as you haven’t turned off this option, you can safely turn off your computer as soon as you see the DOS prompt.  2. For SMARTDrive to use extended memory, you must load HIMEM.SYS or some other  3. By default, SMARTDRV.EXE tries to load into upper memory. You do not need to use the  extended memory manager.  LOADHIGH command.  4. If you are using double buffering and your system runs slowly, try loading  SMARTDrive with the  L switch.  5. Double buffering is required only by some ESDI and SCSI hard disk interfaces. 6. If you have a compressed disk drive, use SMARTDrive on the underlying uncom-  pressed  host  drive.  7. If you want SMARTDrive to cache a CD-ROM drive, you have to load MSCDEX into memory before SMARTDrive. MSCDEX creates the link that DOS needs to access a  CD-ROM drive. If SMARTDrive is loaded before the drive letter is allocated, it will never know that the drive exists. You can enable or disable CD-ROM read caching by using the drive ± parameter, or you can disable it completely by using the  U switch. Using the  U switch decreases SMARTDrive’s memory use a little.  8. If you are using a third-party CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle manager, that utility  needs to be set up to perform a SMARTDRV  C operation before it reboots your computer. 9. DOS 6.0 comes with SMARTMON.EXE, a Windows program for monitoring and adjusting  SMARTDrive.  Examples  To start SMARTDrive with all the defaults  a good ﬁt for most systems , use the following command: C:\DOS\SMARTDRV  To enable read caching for drive C, read and write caching for drive D, and using a 4MB cache for DOS that can get no smaller than 2MB when Microsoft Windows is running, issue the following command: C:\DOS\SMARTDRV  C  D+ 4096 2048  App F  See Also  BUFFERS=, EMM386.EXE, HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and SMARTMON  “Using a Disk Cache  SMARTDrive ” in Chapter 7   914  Appendix F Command Reference  CONFIG  SYS  DEVICE =  SMARTDRV.EXE  device driver   6.0 and later— External  When used as a device driver, SMARTDRV.EXE enables double buffering, which is required by certain types of hard disk controllers that cannot work with the memory provided by EMM386.EXE.  Syntax  DEVICE=drive:\path\SMARTDRV.EXE   DOUBLE_BUFFER  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\   DOUBLE_BUFFER  Speciﬁes the full path to the SMARTDRV.EXE ﬁle on your system. Setup places the SMARTDRV.EXE ﬁle in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default. If the full path to SMARTDRV.EXE isn’t speciﬁed, DOS looks for the ﬁle in the root directory of the startup drive.  Enables double buffering. Inserting this switch into your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle does not hurt if your system does not need it, but it does take up memory. You can remove the switch if all the entries in the buffering column of the SMARTDRV  S display are no.  It may take a while for - entries to turn into no entries.   1. Double buffering is required only by some ESDI and SCSI hard disk interfaces when  used on a computer that provides upper memory blocks for DOS to use. 2. If you are using double buffering and your system runs slowly, try loading  SMARTDrive with the  L switch.  Notes  Examples  To load the SMARTDrive double-buffering feature, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE   DOUBLE_BUFFER  See Also  DEVICE= and SMARTDRV  “Using a Disk Cache  SMARTDrive ” in Chapter 7  SMARTMON  6.0 and later—Windows The SMARTDrive Monitor  SMARTMON  is a Windows program that can display the status of the SMARTDrive disk cache and adjust its settings.

For SMARTMON to be useful, you must be running the SMARTDrive disk cache on your computer.  SMARTMON cannot be run from the DOS command line. You can start SMARTMON from within Windows, for example, by opening the Program Manager’s File menu and choosing the Run command. For instructions on using the program, run SMARTMON and press F1 or choose Help from the menu.  See Also  SMARTDRV  SORT  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  2.0 and later—External  SORT is a program that reads lines from the standard input device, performs an ASCII sort on those lines, and then writes them to the standard output device. The sort can be in ascending or descending order and can start at any column in the line.

Starts sorting with the characters in column number column. column needs to be a positive integer. The default is 1.  Sorts in descending order. Thus, the letter Z comes ﬁrst and the letter A comes last, followed by the numbers 9 to 0. The default sort order is ascending.  App F   916  Appendix F Command Reference  Notes  1. If you do not redirect the input or output, all input is from the keyboard  standard  input , and all output is to the video display  standard output . If you redirect input and output, use different names for the input and output ﬁles.  2. SORT can handle a maximum ﬁle size of 64KB  65,535 characters . 3. SORT sorts text ﬁles and discards any information after, and including, the end-of-ﬁle  4. SORT uses the collating sequence appropriate to your country code and code-page set-  marker  Ctrl+Z .  tings if you are using them.  5. SORT is not case sensitive; that is, the command treats b and B alike. 6. You cannot set the maximum column that SORT can use to resolve equalities. SORT starts  at the  +column speciﬁed and continues the comparison until the lines are proven unequal or the end of the line is reached. Because of this sorting method, you cannot use SORT to perform a multikey sort by sorting the ﬁle more than once.  Examples  To sort the lines in the ﬁle WORDS.TXT and display the sorted lines onscreen, use the follow- ing command: SORT  <  WORDS.TXT  To sort, in reverse order, the lines in the ﬁle WORDS.TXT and display the lines onscreen, use this command: SORT  <  WORDS.TXT   R  To start sorting at the eighth character of each line in WORDS.TXT and display the output onscreen, use this command: SORT   +8  < WORDS.TXT  To display directory information, sorted by ﬁle size, use the following command: DIR    SORT   +14   The ﬁle size starts in the 14th column.  Unfortunately, other lines, such as the volume label, also are sorted, starting in the 14th column. DIR  O provides a more direct and elabo- rate way of sorting directory information.

Before switch- ing to the appropriate interrupt service routine, DOS stores the information it needs to resume the interrupted task in an area called a stack. You can use the STACKS= command to determine how many stacks DOS sets aside for this purpose and how big each stack is. You can use STACKS= only in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Syntax  STACKS=numstacks,size  Parameters and Switches  numstacks  The number of stacks to set aside for hardware interrupts. Legal values are 0 and 8 through 64. The default value is 0 for 8088- and 8086-based comput- ers and 9 for all others.  size  The size of each stack in bytes. Legal values are 0  only if you specify 0 stacks as well  and 32 through 512. The default value is 0 for 8088- and 8086-based computers and 128 for all others.   STACKS= 3.2 and later—Internal  919  Notes  1. Both parameters for the STACKS= command are required. Note that a size of 0 is  allowed only if you are using 0 numstacks as well.  2. There is considerable controversy over whether separate hardware stacks are needed for the average computer system, but in general, using at least MS-DOS’s default values is a good idea. This uses some memory, but if it saves you from losing your work, it’s worthwhile. Almost all the devices attached to your computer generate interrupts and if they all want attention at once, they can quickly exhaust a low STACKS= setting. When the internal DOS stacks overﬂow, an error message appears  see the ﬁrst item, Internal Stack Overflow, in the following “Messages” section , and the system halts. MemMaker often increases the STACKS= setting to 9,256. STACKS=0,0 forces DOS to use the active program’s stack space when servicing hardware interrupts. Many people run their computers with this setting and never experience any problems. But be warned that STACKS=0,0 may work for months and then, without warning, overﬂow a program’s stack space, crashing your computer. If you are using this setting and see a Stack Overflow error message, increase the STACKS= setting to at least 9,128 or 9,256.  3. If you are not using the STACKS=0,0 setting, try to limit your choices for the size para- meter to 128, 256, or 512. Using these settings isn’t required, but specifying a size that is an even power of two makes the stacks easier for DOS to manage. Also, except when you’re using the STACKS=0,0 setting, avoid size values less than 128. A small stack is much more likely to overﬂow, and you are just asking for trouble if you set the size of DOS’s hardware stacks to anything less than 128.  Examples  To use the default number of stacks but increase their size to 256 bytes each, use the follow- ing line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  This setting has virtually become the standard for people who are not disabling internal stacks in their computers.  STACKS=9,256  To instruct DOS not to set up any internal stacks, and use the active program’s stack space for servicing interrupts, include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: STACKS=0,0  App F  Messages  Internal stack overflow System halted  Error: The stack that MS-DOS was using to service interrupts has overﬂowed, and the sys- tem has been halted. You need to restart your computer. If you have this problem, increase the numstacks and or size setting for the STACKS= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.   920  Appendix F Command Reference  Exception Error 12  Error: Same as the preceding message, except that this message is displayed when you are running in protected mode  for example, under Windows . Invalid STACK parameters  Warning: You have speciﬁed an invalid parameter on the STACKS= line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. Check the entry to make sure that you have speciﬁed values for both numstacks and size and that these values are within the legal range for the STACKS= command.  SUBMENU=  CONFIG  SYS  6.0 and later—Internal  SUBMENU= is one of the new CONFIG.SYS menu commands. With it, you can create a multi- level menu from which to choose your startup conﬁguration. You can use SUBMENU= only inside a menu block in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Syntax  SUBMENU=blockname, menutext  Parameters and Switches  blockname  menutext  Notes  The name of the menu block that you want to display when this menu item is chosen. blockname can be up to 70 characters long, but it can’t contain any spaces or the following special characters:  \     ,  ;  =  [  ]   For more details, see the entry for [blockname] in this command refer- ence.  This argument is required.  The text you want DOS to display for this menu line. menutext can  be up to 70 characters long and contain any text you want, including spaces. Separate menutext from blockname with a comma. If no  menutext is provided, DOS displays the blockname in the menu.  1. The SUBMENU= command can appear only inside menu blocks in CONFIG.SYS.  CONFIG.SYS allows two types of blocks: menu blocks and conﬁguration blocks. Each block begins with a [blockname], and includes all the lines that follow, up to the next [blockname]. Menu blocks, which are blocks named [MENU] or deﬁned with a  SUBMENU= command, can include only menu-related commands. All other CONFIG.SYS commands belong in conﬁguration blocks.   SUBMENU= 6.0 and later—Internal  921  2. Up to nine choices can be displayed in a menu, so you are limited to nine MENUITEM=  and SUBMENU= commands in each menu block. Each menu item appears onscreen in the order that it appears in the menu block, numbered from 1 to 9.  Before you construct an extensive menu system in CONFIG.SYS, remember that you will have to wade through it each time you reboot your computer. A simple startup menu, with a handful of options and perhaps one submenu, works best.  3. If DOS cannot ﬁnd the block referred to by a SUBMENU= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, it doesn’t display that choice in the menu. Your startup menu may fail if SUBMENU= doesn’t refer to a valid menu block.  4. In a multiconﬁguration submenu, you can return to the previous menu by pressing the  Backspace key.  Examples  Suppose that you’re using a main menu that enables you to choose from three basic conﬁg- urations for your computer: Windows, DOS, and Maintenance. For the DOS conﬁguration, you want to add a submenu with two variations: One conﬁgures memory for normal DOS programs, and the other provides your CADD program with the special memory interface it requires. To do so, add the following lines to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: [MENU] MENUITEM=WIN, Configure for Windows  Default  SUBMENU=DOS, Configure for MS-DOS MENUITEM=MAINT, Configure for File & Disk Maintenance MENUDEFAULT=WIN, 30 [DOS] MENUITEM=NORMAL, Configure for Normal MS-DOS Programs MENUITEM=CADD, Configure for CADD with INT15 Interface MENUDEFAULT=NORMAL, 30  When you include these lines in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, DOS searches for blocks named [WIN], [DOS], and [MAINT]. If those blocks exist in the ﬁle, the main menu that DOS displays looks something like the following: MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu =====================  App F  1. Configure for Windows  Default  2. Configure for MS-DOS 3. Configure for File & Disk Maintenance  Enter a choice: 1  Entering 1, 2, or 3 at this menu instructs DOS to execute the [WIN], [DOS], or [MAINT] block, respectively. If no entry is made within about 30 seconds, DOS chooses the [WIN]   922  Appendix F Command Reference  conﬁguration by default. As long as the [NORMAL] and [CADD] blocks exist in CONFIG.SYS, choosing 2 brings up the following submenu. MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu =====================  1. Configure for Normal MS-DOS Programs 2. Configure for CADD with INT15 Interface  Enter a choice: 1  Entering 1 or 2 at this menu instructs DOS to execute the [NORMAL] or [CADD] conﬁguration block, respectively. If you do not make an entry within about 30 seconds, DOS chooses the [NORMAL] conﬁguration by default. To return to the ﬁrst menu, press the Backspace key.  See Also  SUBST  AVOID  BATCH  FILE  C:\>  [blockname], MENUCOLOR=, MENUDEFAULT=, and MENUITEM=  “Creating Multiple Conﬁgurations” in Chapter 2  3.1 and later—External  SUBST is one of the pretender commands. It can create a drive alias for a subdirectory and fool many  but not all  programs. You might need to use SUBST to get older programs that don’t understand subdirectories to run. Unless you have a speciﬁc use for SUBST, however, avoid it. You can easily make a mistake and lose data when you are pretending.  Syntax  SUBST alias:  drive:path  D  Parameters and Switches  alias:  Speciﬁes a valid drive name that becomes the alias, or nickname. alias: may be a nonexistent drive, but it must be available for use and less than or equal to the value speciﬁed by the LASTDRIVE= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  drive:path  Speciﬁes the drive name and directory path to be nicknamed alias:. The default for drive: is the current drive. You cannot specify the  D parameter when you create an alias by using drive:path.  Deletes the alias drive. Do not specify a drive:path parameter when you are deleting an alias drive.  1. Entering SUBST with no parameters displays a list of all the drive substitutions currently   D  Notes  deﬁned.   SUBST 3.1 and later—External  923  2. The drive letter you use as the alias drive must be available and within the range speci- ﬁed with the LASTDRIVE= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. You cannot use drive letters reserved by Interlnk as SUBST drive aliases. If a drive letter is already in use as a SUBST drive alias, you must delete the previous assignment before assigning that drive letter to another drive:path.  3. You cannot create SUBST alias drives that refer to subdirectories on a drive that is not  local to your computer. Network, CD-ROM, and Interlnk drives are all redirected drives and cannot be used with SUBST.  4. When you delete an alias drive created by the SUBST command, include the drive letter of the alias drive, not the subdirectory that the alias refers to. For example, to delete the alias drive E, enter the following line at the DOS prompt: SUBST  E:   D  5. You can’t use any of the following DOS commands on an alias drive created by the  SUBST command:  ASSIGN BACKUP CHKDSK DEFRAG DISKCOMP DISKCOPY FDISK  FORMAT JOIN LABEL MIRROR RECOVER RESTORE SYS  The preceding commands refuse to work on an alias drive created by SUBST, so if you do try to use them, no harm will be done.  6. Do not create or delete any SUBST alias drives while Microsoft Windows is running. If you create the SUBST aliases before starting Microsoft Windows, you can use the alias drives from within a DOS session in Windows.  Messages  Cannot SUBST a network drive  Error: You tried to use a nonlocal drive as the alias drive. You cannot use network, Interlnk, or CD-ROM drives with SUBST. Drive already SUBSTed  Error: You are trying to create a new SUBST drive alias using a drive letter that already is a SUBST drive alias. Delete the previous assignment by entering SUBST drive:  D and try again. Invalid parameter  Error: The value that you speciﬁed for the alias drive  alias:  is invalid. You might need to increase the value speciﬁed by the LASTDRIVE= command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. This mes- sage is also displayed if you try to create an alias for a subdirectory on an alias drive. The drive:path parameter for the SUBST command must refer to a real local disk drive.  App F   924  Appendix F Command Reference  See Also  ASSIGN and JOIN  “The SUBST Command” in Chapter 11  DR-DOS  SWITCH  Syntax  SWITCH label1, label2, ...  Parameters and Switches  label1, label2, ...  CONFIG  SYS  You can use the SWITCH command to enable several different optional subroutines in a  CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  The names of up to nine subroutines in the CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. The subroutine names are preceded by a colon  :  at the beginning of the line in the CONFIG.SYS ﬁle and subroutine blocks end with RETURN.  SWITCHES=  CONFIG  SYS  5.0 and later—Internal The SWITCHES= command is a collection of options that conﬁgure DOS for certain circum- stances. Options enable you to move the WINA20.386 ﬁle out of the root directory, cause an enhanced keyboard to behave like a standard keyboard, and disable DOS 6’s new startup keys. You can use SWITCHES= only in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  Syntax  SWITCHES= K   F   N   W  Parameters and Switches   K   F   N   W  Forces an enhanced keyboard to behave as though it were an older, standard key- board.   DOS 6 only  Eliminates the two-second pause that occurs when the Starting  MS-DOS... message appears onscreen.   DOS 6 only  Disables the F5 Clean and F8 Interactive boot keys.  Enables you to move the WINA20.386 ﬁle out of the root directory of your startup drive.  Notes  1. The SWITCHES= command can be located anywhere in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle. DOS scans  the ﬁle looking for it before displaying the Starting MS-DOS... message.   SWITCHES= 5.0 and later—Internal  925  2. If you are having problems with an older application incorrectly interpreting your  enhanced keyboard, the  K switch might solve your problems. Enhanced keyboards nor- mally generate certain key codes that were not available on the older 84-key keyboards. Specifying  K forces DOS to translate these new key codes into their equivalent 84-key keyboard codes. The  K switch affects only programs that get their keyboard input from DOS. Many programs bypass DOS, getting keyboard input from the BIOS or, in some cases, directly from the keyboard. For these programs, the  K switch has no effect.  3. If you are using both the  K switch and ANSI.SYS device driver, make sure to include a   K switch on the line that loads ANSI.SYS as well.  4. By disabling DOS 6.22’s F5 Clean and F8 Interactive boot keys with the  N switch, you force your computer to always start up with the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁles that are present in your root directory. If security is a concern, and you load security features in these ﬁles, you might want to specify this switch. To truly secure your computer, however, you might need to lock your ﬂoppy drives, protect your startup ﬁles, and take other precautions as well. This switch is only a minor obstacle to a determined user and is meant as a simple means to perhaps “user-proof” a menu system.  Before you specify the  N switch, be sure that you have a bootable ﬂoppy disk that starts up your system in a usable condition.  You need access to your hard drive and at least a text editor such as EDIT to ﬁx your startup ﬁles.  Never specify this switch until you have completely debugged your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁles.  5. The  F switch is intended to be used with the  N switch. After you have disabled the F5 and F8 keys, you don’t need a two-second pause at startup so that you can press them.  6. Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode requires the WINA20.386 driver ﬁle to be available  before it loads.  See the ﬁrst message in the following “Messages” section.  If you want to move the WINA20.386 ﬁle out of your root directory, you need to specify the  W switch in CONFIG.SYS and add the following line to the [386Enh] section of your  SYSTEM.INI ﬁle: DEVICE=drive:\path\WINA20.386 You should specify the full drive and path to WINA20.386 in the device line in SYSTEM.INI.  App F  Windows 3.1 can load successfully in enhanced mode without access to the WINA20.386 driver, but any version 3.0 drivers that you’re using may still require the services of the WINA20.386 driver. If they do and that driver is unavailable, Windows may become unstable or crash. Because enhanced-mode drivers for Windows are dis- tributed with many software packages, most people are running Windows 3.1 with Windows 3.0 drivers without knowing it. To be safe, be sure that the WINA20.386 dri- ver is available, either in the root directory or through the  W switch and a device line in SYSTEM.INI.   926  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  You depend on an older application that doesn’t respond to the right-side Shift and Ctrl keys properly. To force your enhanced keyboard to return the same keycodes for both the left and right Shift and Ctrl keys, you include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: SWITCHES= K  If you use ANSI.SYS, remember to add the  K switch to the DEVICE= line that loads ANSI.SYS as well.  Perhaps you have set up a menu system that you want everyone who uses your computer to use. To avoid having people bypass it, you might want to disable the new DOS 6 interactive startup features by adding the following line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: SWITCHES= F  N  Although you use Windows 3.1, you’re not sure whether all your Windows enhanced-mode drivers have been updated yet and want to make sure that the WINA20.386 driver is available, just in case. Because you’ve moved the WINA20.386 ﬁle into the C:\DOS subdirectory with your other DOS 6.x ﬁles, you need to include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: SWITCHES= W  Now that DOS knows you’ve moved WINA20.386, you need to tell Windows where you put it. To do so, add the following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI ﬁle, which is located in your main Windows subdirectory: DEVICE=C:\DOS\WINA20.386  Messages  You must have the file WINA20.386 in the root directory of your boot drive to run Windows in Enhanced Mode  Error: This message is displayed only if you are running Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode and the WINA20.386 ﬁle is not present in your root directory. To enable Windows 3.0 to run in enhanced mode with the WINA20.386 driver located somewhere else, specify the SWITCHES= W command in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle and enter a DEVICE=drive:\path\WINA20.386 line in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI.

C:\>  BATCH  FILE  TIME  1.0 and later—Internal The TIME command can display and set the current time for your computer. Normally, DOS and your computer’s hardware attempt to keep the time set properly. If you don’t have an AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle, DOS prompts you to enter the current date each time your computer reboots.  To display the time and have DOS prompt you to enter a new time, use the following  format:  Syntax  TIME  hh:mm:ss.xx  AP  Parameters and Switches  The one- or two-digit number that represents hours  0 to 23 . To set the time, this parameter is required.  The one- or two-digit number that represents minutes  0 to 59 . This param eter is optional.  The one- or two-digit number that represents seconds  0 to 59 . This parameter is optional.  The one- or two-digit number that represents hundredths of a second  0 to 99 . This parameter is optional.  Entering an A or a P can designate a.m. or p.m., respectively. You can use upper- or lowercase letters. If you do not use A or P, you must enter the time in  24-hour  military  format.  TIME  hh  mm  ss  xx  AP  Notes  1. Depending on the country code setting in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle, a comma may be the  separator between seconds and hundredths of seconds.  Refer to the section on the COUNTRY command earlier in this command reference.   2. The TIME command sets the computer’s internal 24-hour clock. The time and date are recorded in the directory when you create or change a ﬁle. This information can help you ﬁnd the most recent version of a ﬁle when you check your directory.  3. Most PCs use an internal clock, backed up by a battery, that is accurate to about one  minute a month, so you rarely have to set the time after you set it initially. If your sys- tem does not retain the time after you turn off your computer, however, put TIME and   DATE commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁle so that DOS does not default to a nonsense time and date when you turn on your computer.  4. If you press Enter after the time prompt, DOS does not change the current time.

TREE  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  The TREE command displays a visual representation of the subdirectory structure on your disk, which is often referred to as the directory tree. TREE can be useful for printing a map of your hard drive if you redirect its output to your printer.  2.0 and later—External  Syntax  TREE drive:path   F   A  Parameters and Switches  drive:  path   F   A  Speciﬁes the drive that holds the disk for which you want to display the direc- tory structure. If you omit drive:, DOS assumes the current drive.  Speciﬁes the subdirectory in which you want the examination to start. If you omit path, DOS displays a directory tree that starts with the current directory.  Displays all ﬁles in each directory. Using the  F switch can make the output gen- erated by TREE rather lengthy.  Uses ASCII characters rather than the default graphics characters to display the connection of subdirectories. If you are redirecting the output of TREE to your printer, you might want to use this switch. Not all printers can print the block graphics characters that TREE uses in its display.

TYPE  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  1.0 and later—Internal The TYPE command displays the contents of a ﬁle onscreen. If the ﬁle is an ASCII text ﬁle, you are able to read it. If it’s a binary ﬁle, however, the screen may seem to ﬁll up with gib- berish while beeping, and you may think you’ve broken your computer. No harm has been done, but displaying binary ﬁles onscreen is a fairly useless operation. The CLS command cleans up the mess for you.  Syntax  TYPE  pathname  Parameters and Switches  pathname The ﬁle that you want TYPE to display. If you do not specify a drive, DOS assumes the current drive. If you do not specify a subdirectory path, DOS assumes the current directory. The ﬁlename portion of this parameter is required. Wildcards are not allowed.  Notes  contents.  1. The TYPE command displays a ﬁle’s characters onscreen. You can use TYPE to see a ﬁle’s  2. Strange characters appear onscreen when you use TYPE for some data ﬁles and most  program ﬁles because TYPE tries to display the machine-language instructions as ASCII characters.  3. As you can with most other DOS commands, you can redirect the output of TYPE to the printer by adding > PRN to the command line or by pressing Ctrl+PrtSc. Don’t forget to press Ctrl+PrtSc again to turn off the printing instruction.  4. To keep the contents of a long ﬁle from scrolling off the screen before you can read  them, you can pipe the output of TYPE through MORE. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+S to stop the display and Ctrl+Q to restart it.

C:\>  BATCH  FILE  T S R  UNDELETE  5.0 and later—External UNDELETE recovers ﬁles that were deleted with the DEL command. In DOS 5.0, UNDELETE uses MIRROR’s delete tracking ﬁle  if available  to restore a deleted ﬁle. In DOS 6, UNDELETE uses a delete sentry ﬁle or a delete tracking ﬁle  if either exists  to restore a deleted ﬁle. Either ver- sion may be able to restore a deleted ﬁle without any special ﬁles if the ﬁle was deleted recently and little disk activity has occurred since the deletion.  Syntax  In DOS 5.0, use the following format: UNDELETE pathname  LIST   DT   DOS   ALL  In DOS 6, to load the memory-resident program that UNDELETE uses for delete sentry and delete tracking protection, use the following format: UNDELETE   LOAD   Sdrive   Tdrive-entries  In DOS 6, to manipulate UNDELETE, use the following format: UNDELETE   LIST   ALL   PURGEdrive   STATUS   UNLOAD  In DOS 6, to undelete one or more ﬁles, use the following format: UNDELETE  pathname   DT   DS   DOS   LIST   ALL  Parameters and Switches  pathname  Speciﬁes the ﬁle or ﬁles that you want to undelete. If you do not specify a drive, DOS assumes the current drive. If you do not specify a subdi- rectory path, DOS assumes the current directory. Wildcards are allowed. If you omit this parameter, DOS undeletes all deleted ﬁles in the current directory.   UNDELETE 5.0 and later—External  937  Restores ﬁles without prompting. The Delete Sentry method is used if it is available. Otherwise, the Delete Tracker method is used, if it is available. If neither method is available, the normal DOS directory method is used  see the “Notes” section for this command . You can use  ALL with any of the other switches.  Restores ﬁles that DOS lists as deleted. UNDELETE prompts you before each ﬁle is restored.  Recovers only the ﬁles listed in the SENTRY directory. UNDELETE prompts you before each ﬁle is restored.  Restores only the ﬁles listed in the delete tracking ﬁle. UNDELETE prompts you before each ﬁle is restored.  Provides a list of deleted ﬁles but does not undelete them. The type of list produced varies with the use of the  DT,  DS, and  DOS switches.  Loads the Undelete memory-resident program into conventional mem- ory, using the UNDELETE.INI ﬁle. If that ﬁle does not exist, UNDELETE cre- ates a default UNDELETE.INI ﬁle.  Deletes the contents of the SENTRY directory created by Delete Sentry protection. drive defaults to the current drive.

UNDELETE is unable to release the memory it was using if any other memory-resident software has been loaded after it.  1. UNDELETE cannot restore deleted subdirectories. 2. UNDELETE cannot restore a ﬁle if you deleted the subdirectory that contained the ﬁle. 3. Do not use Delete Tracker for any drive that has been redirected with JOIN or SUBST.  1. UNDELETE restores deleted ﬁles, using the delete tracking or delete sentry ﬁle  if either  exists , or the standard DOS directory.  2. Delete Sentry provides the highest level of protection by saving deleted ﬁles in a SENTRY directory. The size of the SENTRY directory  including the ﬁles that it contains  is limited to approximately 7 percent of your disk. DOS purges old ﬁles to make room for new ones.  3. Delete Tracker provides an intermediate level of protection by maintaining a hidden ﬁle  called PCTRACKR.DEL that records the locations of a ﬁle’s allocation units  clusters . You can recover a deleted ﬁle until its freed allocation units are allocated to a new ﬁle. Delete Tracker takes the same amount of memory as Delete Sentry.  4. When you delete a ﬁle, DOS removes the ﬁrst character in the ﬁlename. If you use  UNDELETE with the  DOS switch, you are prompted for a character to replace the missing ﬁrst character. If you use the  ALL switch, and if a delete tracking or delete sentry ﬁle does not exist, UNDELETE restores each deleted ﬁle without prompts, using the character  as the ﬁrst character of the ﬁlename. A deleted ﬁle named BETTER.TXT, for example, is undeleted as ETTER.TXT. If BETTER.TXT and LETTER.TXT are deleted, DOS restores BETTER.TXT as ETTER.TXT and LETTER.TXT as %ETTER.TXT. UNDELETE tries the following replacement characters for the ﬁrst letter of the ﬁlename, in the order shown, until a unique ﬁlename is found:  The pound sign    The percentage sign  %  The ampersand  &  The digits 0 through 9 The characters A through Z  5. Although UNDELETE enables you to recover ﬁles that you deleted accidentally, do not use this command as a substitute for backing up data. Be sure to keep up to date backups of your data.   UNFORMAT 5.0 and later—External  939  Examples  For the following examples, assume that the DOS commands are stored in a directory that is in your PATH.  To restore all deleted ﬁles in the root directory of drive C without prompting for conﬁrma- tion on each ﬁle, use this command: C:\UNDELETE   ALL  To provide a list of all currently deleted ﬁles, use the following command: UNDELETE   LIST  To create C:\PCTRACKR.DEL to track up to 200 deleted ﬁles on drive C and load the memory- resident portion of UNDELETE, use this command: UNDELETE   TC-200  See Also  MWUNDEL and UNFORMAT  “Recovering Deleted Files with UNDELETE” in Chapter 9  C:\>  UNFORMAT  5.0 and later—External  The UNFORMAT utility can recover a disk that was inadvertently reformatted. In DOS 5.0, UNFORMAT uses the ﬁles produced by the MIRROR command  if those ﬁles are available  to restore the disk to its condition before reformatting. In DOS 5.0 and 6, you probably can unformat disks if they were not formatted with FORMAT  U. The UNFORMAT command works on both hard disks and ﬂoppy disks.  Syntax  UNFORMAT  drive:  J   L   P   U   TEST   PARTN  Parameters and Switches  drive:  Speciﬁes the drive where the deleted ﬁle resides. This parameter is required.   J   L   P  Conﬁrms that the MIRROR command contains the necessary information to restore the disk. This switch does not unformat the disk.  Lists all ﬁles and directory names found. If used with the  PARTN switch,  L dis- plays current partition tables. The default  no  L  is to list only subdirectories and fragmented ﬁles.  Directs all output to the printer connected to LPT1.   PARTN  Restores the partition table of a hard disk. You must use the PARTNSAV.FIL ﬁle created by the MIRROR  PARTN command.  App F   940  Appendix F Command Reference   TEST  Shows how UNFORMAT will re-create the information on the disk. Like the  J switch, this switch does not actually unformat the disk.   U  Unformats without using the mirror ﬁles.  1. To unformat your hard disk, you ﬁrst must reboot from drive A, using a specially pre-  pared ﬂoppy disk  see the “Notes” section for this command .  2. If you format a ﬂoppy disk by using the FORMAT  U switch, UNFORMAT cannot restore the  3. UNFORMAT works only on disks that use sector sizes of 512, 1024, or 2048 bytes. 4.

They are included in the FASTHELP that you display by entering UNDELETE  ? at the DOS command prompt.  Rules  disk.  Notes  1. UNFORMAT attempts to recover a formatted disk by using the MIRROR.FIL and  MIRORSAV.FIL ﬁles created by the MIRROR command or by using information in the disk’s root directory and ﬁle allocation table. The second process is slower and less reliable than the ﬁrst.  2. To prepare for the eventuality that you may need to use UNFORMAT, format a ﬂoppy disk  using the  S switch to make the disk bootable  and then transfer the UNFORMAT.EXE ﬁle to that disk. Also, transfer the CONFIG.SYS ﬁles, the AUTOEXEC.BAT ﬁles, and any device drivers needed for the computer’s operation. Thereafter, if you accidentally format the hard disk, you can boot from the ﬂoppy disk and perform an UNFORMAT operation. Before you use UNFORMAT to recover the disk, use the command with the  J or  TEST switches to determine whether your mirror ﬁles are up to date or whether the UNFORMAT command can recover ﬁles in the way that you want.  3. In DOS 6, UNFORMAT cannot recover fragmented ﬁles. DOS asks you whether you want  to recover such ﬁles by truncating them at the end of their contiguous sectors.  See Also  MIRROR and UNDELETE  “Unformatting a Disk” in Chapter 9  DR-DOS  UNINSTALL  If you install DR DOS on a system that already contains an operating system, UNINSTALL removes DR DOS and restores the previous operating system if you saved the OS during   DR DOS setup. UNINSTALL also is used to delete the saved old OS ﬁles if you determine that you no longer need them. When you do that, you cannot uninstall DR DOS and restore the old OS by using this command.

Displays the unstack screen on a monochrome monitor.  Displays abbreviated help.  VER is a simple command that displays the version number of MS-DOS onscreen. If you ever wonder what version of DOS is running on the computer you are using, type VER at the DOS command prompt.  2.0 and later—Internal  1. The VER command displays a one-digit DOS version number, followed by a two-digit  revision number, reminding you which DOS version the computer is using.  2. If a computer is running a customized OEM version of MS-DOS, the name of that  company is normally included in the line that VER displays. For instance, Compaq com- puters usually display the name COMPAQ along with the DOS version number. IBM ver- sions normally display PC DOS instead of MS-DOS.  3. VER is unaffected by the SETVER program. VER always displays the actual version of DOS  that the computer is running.  Examples  To display the version of MS-DOS that’s running on a computer, enter the VER command at the DOS prompt as follows: VER  For MS-DOS 6.22, the following line is displayed onscreen: MS-DOS Version 6.22   VERIFY 2.0 and later—Internal  943  See Also  “Displaying the Version with VER” in Chapter 10  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  VERIFY  2.0 and later—Internal Normally, when DOS writes information to a disk, it trusts the disk hardware to make sure that the data was stored safely. If you want to be absolutely sure, you can enter VERIFY ON; DOS then reads back all the data written to disk and compares it to make sure that it was stored safely. Using VERIFY ON, however, slows down disk-write operations substantially, so this additional level of protection doesn’t come without a price.  Syntax  VERIFY onoff  Parameters and Switches  Notes  onoff  Speciﬁes whether you want to turn on  VERIFY ON  or off  VERIFY OFF  this command. If you omit this parameter, the current state of the verify ﬂag is dis- played.  1. By default, when DOS starts up, VERIFY is OFF. 2. VERIFY accepts only the parameters ON and OFF. 3. VERIFY works by instructing the disk controller to read back all data written to disk, cal-  culate a new CRC  error checking  value from the data read, and compare it to the CRC value stored on the disk.  The disk controller normally does this every time data is read from the disk, which is how DOS discovers bad sectors when copying ﬁles.  Any differences between the two CRC values indicates that an error has occurred. Setting VERIFY ON doesn’t compare the data on disk to the data that DOS was requested to write; it only makes sure that the data written to the disk is readable.  4. If VERIFY is set ON, you have more assurance that your data is being safely stored on disk. If VERIFY is set OFF, writing data to disk takes less time. When deciding which setting to use, you have to choose between data integrity and speed.  5. Specifying the  V parameter for COPY, DISKCOPY, or XCOPY sets VERIFY ON for the dura-  tion of the command. When the copy operation is ﬁnished, these commands set VERIFY back to the state it was in before the command executed.  6. The VERIFY state can be changed by a running program. Programming etiquette dic- tates that, when done, an application should reset any ﬂag, such as VERIFY, to the state in which it was found. Still, you might run across applications that forget to reset  VERIFY. If this causes problems, run the application from a batch ﬁle to restore the  VERIFY state when the program terminates.  App F   944  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  If you are about to update your company’s accounts receivables, you might want to turn on the verify ﬂag, as follows, before starting your accounting software: VERIFY  ON  After you are ﬁnished, you might set the verify ﬂag off again, as follows, so that your routine computer tasks aren’t unnecessarily slowed down: VERIFY  OFF  If you ever want to know whether the verify ﬂag is off or on, enter the VERIFY command with no parameters at the DOS prompt like this: VERIFY  Messages  Must specify ON or OFF  or VERIFY is off  Error: The only parameters that the VERIFY command accepts are ON or OFF. Entering any- thing else displays the preceding error message. VERIFY is on  Information: If you enter VERIFY with no parameters, one of the preceding messages is dis- played, informing you of the current state of the verify ﬂag.  VFINTD.386  6.0 and later—Windows  DISK  Setup installs the VFINTD.386 device driver in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI to allow Microsoft Backup for Windows access to your ﬂoppy disk drives. If you have any other Windows backup software installed, this driver often conﬂicts with the drivers installed for that software.  Syntax  To use Microsoft Backup for Windows, you must include the following line in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI ﬁle:  DEVICE=drive:\path\VFINTD.386  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  The full path to the VFINTD.386 ﬁle on your system. The setup pro- gram for DOS 6 places this ﬁle in the C:\DOS subdirectory by default.   VIEW  945  Notes  1. Almost all backup software for Windows adds a device driver to SYSTEM.INI that allows access to your tape drives and ﬂoppy disk drives. Unfortunately, few of these drivers can get along with each other, and you’re usually forced to remove all but one driver before any of them will work. The following list includes some of the more common third- party drivers to look for in SYSTEM.INI:  Driver Filename  VFINTD.386  CMSDTAPE.386  MYABU.386  FASTBACK.386  VFD.386  CPBVXD.386  Backup Program Microsoft Backup for Windows  with DOS 6  and Norton Backup for Windows Colorado Tape Backup My Advanced Backup Fastback for Windows Central Point Backup for Windows Central Point Backup for Windows  2. Microsoft suggests that you disable any third-party drivers you ﬁnd in SYSTEM.INI by  adding a semicolon to the front of the DEVICE= line that loads them. Be aware that doing so may cause your other backup software to stop working.  3. If your computer fails the compatibility test that Microsoft Backup for Windows runs, you are probably having a driver conﬂict in SYSTEM.INI. If this happens, quit Windows, “comment out” any lines in SYSTEM.INI that load third-party backup drivers  see the pre- ceding Driver table , restart Windows, and try the test again. As long as you comment out the driver lines  by placing a semicolon at the beginning of the line  instead of delet- ing them, you can easily restore them when you want to use your other backup software. 4. Be aware that Windows does not recognize any changes you make in SYSTEM.INI until  you quit Windows completely and restart it from the DOS prompt.  Examples  Setup for DOS 6 adds the following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI ﬁle when it installs Microsoft Backup for Windows on your computer: DEVICE=C:\DOS\VFINTD.386  Setup does not, however, comment out third-party drivers in SYSTEM.INI that are known to cause conﬂicts with the VFINTD.386 driver.  App F  PC-DOS  VIEW  Syntax  You can use VIEW to view an online document.  VIEW drive:\path\filename.inf  ?   Speciﬁes the location and name of the ﬁle to view.

VOL displays the volume label and serial number of a disk if they exist. The volume label is simply a name that you can assign when you format a disk or later when you use the LABEL command. DOS began adding serial numbers to disks with DOS 4.0.  2.0 and later—Internal  946  Appendix F Command Reference  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\filename.inf   ?  VOL  C:\>  BATCH  FILE  Notes  Syntax  VOL drive:  Parameters and Switches  drive:  The drive whose label and serial number you want to display. If you omit this parameter, DOS assumes the current drive.  1. You can add a label to a disk when you format it by using the FORMAT  V command or  later by using the LABEL command.  2. The serial number is a unique identiﬁer assigned to the disk when it’s formatted. DOS uses the serial number to verify that a disk hasn’t been changed in disk drives that don’t have change line support. Preformatted disks often do not have serial numbers on them, and some third-party formatting utilities neglect to add them, as well. DOS may be unable to tell whether you have changed a ﬂoppy disk if it has no serial number and your drive doesn’t have change line support.  3. DOS can assign serial numbers to a disk only with the FORMAT command. You can’t add  or change the serial number of a disk without reformatting it.  Examples  To display the volume label of a ﬂoppy disk in drive B:, enter the following command at the DOS prompt: VOL  B:  If you omit the drive: parameter  B: , DOS assumes the current disk.   VSAFE 6.0 and later—External  947  VOL displays the following messages if the disk speciﬁed has both a volume label and a serial number: Volume in drive B: is NEW WORK Volume Serial Number is 4EF7-9C30  If the disk has no serial number, the second line is omitted.

Setup for MS-DOS 6 places this driver in the root directory if it ﬁnds Windows installed on your system. If you move the WINA20.386 ﬁle to another subdirectory, you need to tell Windows where it is and add a SWITCHES= W line to your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle.  To tell Windows where you have located the WINA20.386 driver, include the following line in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI: DEVICE=drive:\path\WINA20.386  Parameters and Switches  drive:\path\  The full path to the WINA20.386 ﬁle on your system. The setup pro- gram for DOS 6 places this ﬁle in the root directory of the startup drive by default.  Syntax  Notes  Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode requires the WINA20.386 driver ﬁle to be available before it can load.  See the ﬁrst message in the following “Messages” section.  If you want to move the WINA20.386 ﬁle out of your root directory, you need to specify the  W switch in CONFIG.SYS and add a DEVICE=drive:\path\WINA20.386 line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI ﬁle. You should specify the full drive and path to WINA20.386 in the device line in SYSTEM.INI.  Windows 3.1 will load successfully in enhanced mode without access to the WINA20.386 driver, but any version 3.0 drivers that you’re using may still require the services of the WINA20.386 driver. If they do and that driver is unavailable, Windows may become unstable or crash. Because enhanced-mode drivers for Windows are dis- tributed with many software packages, most people are running Windows 3.1 with Windows 3.0 drivers without knowing it. To be safe, be sure that the WINA20.386 dri- ver is available, either in the root directory or through the  W switch and a device line in SYSTEM.INI.  App F   950  Appendix F Command Reference  Examples  Although you use Windows version 3.1, you’re not sure whether all your Windows enhanced-mode drivers have been updated yet and want to make sure that the WINA20.386 driver is available, just in case. Because you’ve moved the WINA20.386 ﬁle into the C:\DOS subdirectory with your other DOS 6 ﬁles, you need to include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS ﬁle: SWITCHES= W  Now that DOS knows you’ve moved WINA20.386, you need to tell Windows where you put it.

Copies only ﬁles that were changed or created on or after the date you specify. The date’s form depends on the setting of the COUNTRY= command in CONFIG.SYS.  Creates parallel subdirectories on the destination disk, even if the original subdirectory is empty.  Copies only ﬁles whose archive attribute is on  modiﬁed ﬁles  and turns  off the archive attribute.  M is similar to  A, except  M resets the archive attribute.  Causes XCOPY to prompt you for approval before copying each ﬁle.  Copies all directories and subdirectories below source that contain ﬁles.  Veriﬁes that the copy was written correctly.  Causes XCOPY to prompt you and wait for your response before starting the copy operation. You can use this switch to give yourself time to insert the source ﬂoppy disk, for example.  Speciﬁes that you want XCOPY to overwrite ﬁles without prompting you for conﬁrmation. Including this parameter overrides any setting speciﬁed with the COPYCMD environment variable.  Speciﬁes that you want XCOPY to prompt you for conﬁrmation before over- writing any ﬁles, even if the command is run from within a batch ﬁle. Including this parameter overrides any setting speciﬁed with the COPYCMD environment variable.  ERRORLEVEL Value 0 1 2 4  5  Meaning Extended copy operation successful No ﬁles found to copy Halted by user  Ctrl+C  Copy operation failed—Invalid drive letter, invalid switches or parameters, not enough memory, or not enough disk space Halted by fatal error writing to disk  App F   952  Appendix F Command Reference  Rules  1. You must specify the source drive, path, and ﬁlename ﬁrst, and then the destination  2. Do not use a device name other than a drive for source or destination. For example,  drive, path, and ﬁlename.  you cannot use LPT1: or COM1:.  3. The source ﬁle speciﬁed must include one or both of the following:    A valid ﬁlename. Wildcards are permitted.   A drive name, a pathname, or both.  4. If you do not specify the source drive name, DOS uses the current drive. 5. If you do not specify the source path, DOS uses the drive’s current directory. 6. If you specify a drive or path for the source but do not specify a source ﬁlename, DOS  7. If you omit a new name for the destination ﬁle, the copied ﬁle has the same name as the  8. If you do not specify a destination parameter, the source parameter must include one  assumes all ﬁles  *.* .  source ﬁle.  or both of the following:    A drive name other than the current drive.   A pathname other than the current disk’s current directory.  9. XCOPY sets the archive bit on for the ﬁles it creates.  Notes  1. Starting with DOS 6.22, the XCOPY command, when run from the command line,  prompts you for conﬁrmation before overwriting ﬁles. However, to avoid forcing you to rewrite all your batch ﬁles, XCOPY does not prompt you before overwriting a ﬁle when run from a batch ﬁle. If you don’t like XCOPY’s new behavior, you can change it by deﬁning an environment variable named COPYCMD. Setting COPYCMD equal to  Y forces XCOPY to act as it did in all previous versions of DOS, never prompting for conﬁrmation before overwriting a ﬁle. If you set COPYCMD equal to  -Y, XCOPY always prompts for conﬁrmation, even when it’s run from within a batch ﬁle.  2. To use XCOPY to copy more ﬁles than ﬁt on one destination disk, make sure that the ﬁles’ archive attribute is on. You can use the ATTRIB command to perform this step. Then use the XCOPY command repeatedly with the  M or  M  S switches. When the destination ﬂoppy disk is full, change ﬂoppy disks and reissue the command. The ﬁles that were copied now have their archive attribute turned off, so XCOPY skips these ﬁles. XCOPY copies the ﬁles not already copied—those ﬁles that have the archive attribute turned on.   XCOPY 3.2 and later—External  953  3. XCOPY and APPEND  X are a troublesome combination. To use XCOPY on a disk that is   involved in an APPEND command, disconnect APPEND before you execute the XCOPY com- mand.  4. Use XCOPY, rather than DISKCOPY, to copy ﬁles to a device that is not the same format as  the source.  Messages  Cannot perform a cyclic copy  Error: You used the  S switch, and at least one of the destination directories is a subdirectory of the source directories. When you use  S, XCOPY cannot copy ﬁles to destination directo- ries that are part of the source directories. If you must copy ﬁles from more than one direc- tory, issue individual XCOPY commands to copy the directories one at a time. Cannot XCOPY from a reserved device  Error: You speciﬁed one of DOS’s reserved device names  for example, LPT1  as the source of the ﬁles to be copied. Reissue XCOPY, using a disk path and directory. Does pathname specify a filename or directory name on the target  F = file, D = directory ?  Information: You speciﬁed a destination ﬁlename in which the ﬁnal name does not exist as a directory. XCOPY does not know whether the ﬁnal name in the destination is a ﬁlename or a directory.  If the destination name is a directory name, press D. XCOPY creates the needed directory and begins copying ﬁles. If the destination name is a ﬁlename, press F. XCOPY copies ﬁles to this ﬁle. nnn File s  copied  Information: XCOPY copied nnn ﬁles to the destination disk. This message appears regardless of any errors that occur. Insufficient disk space  Error: The destination disk ran out of space. The ﬁle that you were copying when the error occurred was erased from the destination. Delete any unneeded ﬁles from the destination disk, or use a different disk and then retry the command. Reading source file s ...  App F  Information: XCOPY is reading the source directories for ﬁlenames. Unable to create directory  Error: XCOPY cannot create a subdirectory on the destination disk for one of the following reasons:    Part of the destination pathname is wrong or misspelled.   The disk’s root directory is full.   954  Appendix F Command Reference    The disk is full.   A ﬁle with the same name as the created directory already exists.   You used a directory name that actually is a device name.  Be sure that the destination name is correct. Use the DIR command to check the destination disk. If the disk or the root directory is full, erase ﬁles or use another destination disk. If a ﬁle that uses the same name as the intended directory already exists, rename the ﬁle or change the directory’s name when you reissue the XCOPY command.  See Also  COPY and REPLACE  “Management with XCOPY” in Chapter 8  Windows  9x  XCOPY32  XCOPY32 is functionally equal to XCOPY, but it is the 32-bit version for use with long ﬁle- names and 32-bit Windows 95 and Windows 98. All the syntax and parameters used with XCOPY are also used with XCOPY32. The following additional parameters also are available with XCOPY32:  Forces XCOPY32 to continue copying even if errors occur.
