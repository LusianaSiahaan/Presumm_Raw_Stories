What	To	Do	When	Your	MacBook	Breaks	Down	On	A	Tropical	Island About	The	Author   The	App	Maker’s	Handbook   Growth	Hacking	Strategies	for	Indie	App	Developers	and Marketers	With	A	Splash	Of	Paradise   Reinder	de	Vries   2015   Introduction  By	Reinder	de	Vries The	App	Maker’s	Handbook	will	give	you	an	effective	framework	for	building	your	own apps.	It’ll	combine	two	distinct	disciplines:  Programming,	building,	coding:	utilizing	technology	to	solve	problems. Marketing,	selling,	growing:	winning	hearts	by	providing	solutions.  These	 two	 disciplines	 are	 usually	 regarded	 as	 different	 from	 one	 another.	 In	 this	 book, you’ll	 disregard	 the	 difference	 between	 them:	 technology	 sells,	 and	 marketing	 means utilizing	smart	technology. As	 an	 indie	 developer,	 you	 often	 wear	 double	 hats:	 debugging	 your	 app,	 using	 your programming	skill.	Then,	you	switch	to	your	marketer	hat	and	talking	to	your	customers. With	 The	 App	 Maker’s	 Handbook	 you’ll	 go	 akimbo:	 dual-wielding	 technology	 and salesmanship,	to	be	leveraged	for	exponential	output. The	structure	of	this	book	is	split	in	two:  First,	you	dive	into	the	framework	that	will	get	you	from	idea	to	App	Store. Second,	you	leverage	your	app’s	users	and	its	initial	traction	to	grow	exponentially.  Each	chapter	comes	with	a	story.	I	accumulated	a	great	number	of	stories	over	the	years I’ve	been	in	the	app	industry.	Stories	put	information	in	perspective;	they	make	the	theory approachable	with	practice.	Running	your	own	app	business	is	awesome.	I	hope	to	inspire you	with	a	splash	of	paradise;	a	few	tales	from	the	playing	field. Ready?	Let’s	go.   The	App	Maker’s	Framework  The	App	Maker’s	Framework	is	a	system	that	will	structure	your	App	Store	endeavours. It’s	 designed	 to	 get	 you	 from	 idea	 to	 App	 Store	 as	 quickly	 as	 possible,	 with	 the	 least overhead	and	risk. Building	an	app	is	risky;	it	takes	time,	and	therefore	resources.	Even	if	you’re	working	on the	 side	  with	 a	 paid	 job ,	 you	 don’t	 want	 to	 spend	 your	 time	 on	 a	 project	 that’s	 never going	to	work.	In	this	sense,	time	is	money. In	the	App	Store	business,	we	know	of	2	different	economic	systems:  1.	 Raising	venture	capital	This	is	what	you	hear	about	in	the	news:	a	kid,	or	a	bigger company,	raised	money	for	app	X.	These	apps	are	mostly	in	gaming,	social	media,	or high	user	volume	platforms.	Valuation	is	based	on	access	to	users	on	the	platform,	i.e. you	have	a	lot	of	users	who’re	willing	to	buy	from	you,	in	one	place.  2.	 Getting	 paying	 customers	 You	 hear	 less	 about	 apps	 who’re	 busy	 getting	 paying customers,	because	they’re	busy	getting	customers!	Instead	of	worrying	about	an	exit, they’ve	watched	what	people	want	to	buy,	from	day	1.	You’ll	leverage	this	system, because	 it’s	 the	 most	 sustainable	 way	 you	 can	 run	 a	 profitable	 business:	 getting paying	customers,	while	building	the	product.  User-growth	businesses	are	running	on	advertising	money;	the	companies	need	to	get	their products	 in	 front	 of	 users	 by	 throwing	 ads	 and	 commercials	 in	 their	 faces.	 It’s	 a consumer’s	perspective	on	the	world:	the	amount	of	interaction	 “engagement” 	you	have with	a	platform	determines	the	income	in	advertising	revenue	for	the	company	that	runs the	platform.	It’s	in	their	interest	to	make	the	platform	as	valuable	for	you	as	possible. Customer-growth	businesses	are	running	on	the	direct	money-for-a-solution;	the	customer rewards	the	business	by	paying	for	a	solution	they	need.	You	call	it	a	monopoly	if	this	user can’t	 get	 this	 solution	 somewhere	 else.	 You	 will	 want	 to	 focus	 on	 a	 customer-growth business,	 because	 those	 businesses	 are	 sustainable;	 it’s	 income	 is	 directly	 tied	 to	 the usability	of	the	solution	that	the	business	sells. In	simpler	words,	you	will	want	to	build	a	business	that	sells	a	solution	to	your	customers. Use	The	App	Maker’s	Framework.	It’s	simple:  1.	 Come	up	with	a	great	idea. 2.	 Validate	your	app	idea. 3.	 Build	a	mockup	of	the	product. 4.	 Graphically	design	it,	and	build	it. 5.	 Listen	to	your	customers,	then	repeat	from	1.   Your	Life	Is	Awesome:	Running	An	App	Store	Business  Can	you	run	a	business,	while	sipping	iced	lattes,	looking	over	a	light	blue	ocean	and	pearl white	beaches?	Yes	you	can.	Let	me	tell	you	about	your	awesome	life. My	 name’s	 Reinder	 and	 I’m	 an	 app	 maker.	 Basically,	 I	 convert	 coffee	 into	 code.	 I’m Dutch,	travel	for	a	few	months	each	year,	and	mostly	spend	time	back	home	in	Norway. If	you’re	anything	like	me	you	own	multiple	successful	businesses.	Your	code	is	used	by millions	of	smartphone	users	around	the	world	and	you’ve	worked	for	a	few	of	the	world’s biggest	brands.	Your	businesses	make	you	a	great	living	and	you’re	still	in	your	twenties. Not	surprisingly,	you’ve	never	had	a	real	job. You	look	up	to	the	likes	of	Steve	Jobs,	Richard	Branson	and	Elon	Musk.	You	regularly zone	out	with	an	ebook	about	crushing	it	online,	your	mindset,	or	managing	your	remote team.	You	make	money	in	US	dollars,	put	them	in	a	European	bank	account,	then	spend your	 cash	 in	 Thai	 baht.	 Not	 to	 mention	 you	 got	 one	 or	 two	 Bitcoins	 stored	 safely	 in	 a digital	wallet,	ready	for	daytrading. You	don’t	have	a	car,	an	office,	and	you	don’t	own	a	house.	Instead,	you	travel	around	the world	with	a	carry-on	daypack	that	contains	less	items	than	the	average	toiletry	kit.	Good WiFi	or	4G LTE	is	your	lifeblood,	and	so	is	strong	espresso.	Your	workforce	is	virtual:	a VA	you	hired	with	Upwork,	a	coder	you	hired	via	Freelancer.com,	and	an	accountant	who is	most	likely	specialized	in	offshore	taxing. Am	I	making	this	stuff	up?	No.	This	is	my	life,	and	it’s	awesome. In	 recent	 years	 I’ve	 traveled	 to	 New	 York,	 Prague,	 Berlin,	 Paris,	 Barcelona,	 Lisbon, Budapest,	Copenhagen,	Oslo,	London,	Bangkok,	Hong	Kong,	Chiang	Mai	and	Saigon	on multiple	occasions.	For	what?	Work	and	play,	of	course! Namedropping	doesn’t	mean	much,	so	what	about	all	the	cultural	goodness	I	picked	up?	If you’re	anything	like	me	…  …	you	know	the	difference	between	Houston	and	Houston	Street. …	you	know	you’re	not	supposed	to	point	your	fingers	to	the	sky	in	Thailand. …	you	know	that	you	don’t	say	“How	much?”	to	a	Songtaew	driver. …	you	know	how	to	get	into	Barcelona’s	exclusive	Opium	nightclub	in	a	t-shirt	and on	flipflops. …	you	know	the	universal	sign	for	“I	want	to	pay	my	check	now”. …	you	know	how	to	get	around	when	you’re	new	in	town,	tired,	hungry,	low	on	cash, don’t	 have	 a	 map,	 don’t	 speak	 the	 language	 and	 your	 bank	 decided	 to	 block	 your creditcard	for	“suspicious	behaviour”. …	you	try	to	blend	in,	but	still	stand	out	like	a	sore	thumb	because	you’re	1.92m	  6′3″	and	the	whitest	European	alive	 thanks,	Holland . …	you	know	to	dress	up	for	Norwegian	Constitution	Day. …	 you	 can	 tell	 the	 difference	 between	 Norwegian,	 Swedish,	 Danish,	 Dutch	 and German. …	you	aren’t	surprised	when	the	power	goes	out	for	3	hours.   Alright,	enough	with	the	bragging.	Here’s	a	picture	of	my	“office”:  My	Office   1.	Ideation  Finding	A	Problem  Where	are	you	now? Are	there	people	around	you?	Look	around. If	you’re	in	a	cafe	or	bar,	perfect.	If	you’re	in	an	informal	business	meeting,	conference, meet-up	or	networking	event,	even	better!	It	doesn’t	really	matter	where	you	are:	as	long as	you’re	with	people.  You’re	in	a	cafe,	bar,	or	any	other	public	place	where	it	is	appropriate	to	talk	to	others informally. You’re	attending	an	event	or	conference	of	sorts,	for	networking	or	meeting	people.  The	key	to	your	situation	is	that	you’ll	want	to	cause	as	much	trouble	as	you	can. Go	to	Meetup.com,	create	an	account	and	look	for	business	or	technology	focused	meet- ups	in	your	area.	Focus	on	those	that	have	an	after-talks	hour	of	meeting	and	networking.  Networking	For	Problem-Solvers  The	following	is	something	you’re	going	to	do,	during	the	above	situations.  1.	 Think	of	an	item	of	clothing	that	people	might	have	on	this	event,	like	red	socks	or	a  tie.	Perhaps	blonde	hair,	or	standing	with	their	hands	in	their	pockets.  2.	 The	first	person	you	see	with	this	clothing	item,	so	the	first	person	with	red	socks,  you’ll	approach.  3.	 Engage	in	a	bit	of	small	talk.	Ask	how	they’re	doing,	what	they’re	looking	to	get	out of	 the	 networking	 event,	 and	 ask	 what	 the	 latest	 thing	 is	 they’ve	 worked	 on passionately.	Try	to	get	someone	talking.	If	you	find	it	hard	to	do	that,	tell	them	3 things	about	yourself:	your	opinion	on	an	actual	matter,	something	you’re	passionate about,	and	something	personal	you’ve	recently	experienced.  4.	 Now	you’re	talking.	Here’s	the	kicker:	ask	what	problem	your	conversation	partner has	had	recently.	It	doesn’t	matter	what	it	is,	as	long	as	the	person	is	able	to	explain what	the	problem	is.	The	key	is	to	understand	what	the	root	cause	of	the	problem	is. Your	 conversation	 partner	 will	 have	 a	 vivid	 understanding	 of	 what	 caused	 their problem,	but	often	they’re	wrong.	As	an	outsider,	you	can	look	more	clearly	at	the issue.	See	if	you	can	put	your	Sherlock	Holmes	hat	on,	get	your	magnifying	glass	out and	 inspect	 what’s	 going	 on.	 Don’t	 forget:	 you’re	 trying	 to	 find	 a	 problem,	 not	 a solution	 yet .  5.	 Time	to	make	a	deal.	Ask	this:	“Would	you	be	willing	to	pay	me	if	I	can	solve	this problem	for	you?”	Listen	to	the	answer.	Most	likely,	someone	will	say:	“Yes,	but	it depends	on	the	price.”	Don’t	fall	for	it,	the	price	of	a	solution	is	determined	by	the value	 it	 holds	 for	 the	 one	 with	 the	 problem.	 It’s	 not	 determined	 by	 the	 cost	 of	 the product	 itself!	 Instead,	 ask	 this:	 “What	 would	 you	 require	 of	 the	 solution	 for	 your   problem?”	 Your	 convo	 partner	 hopefully	 will	 spec	 out	 a	 few	 requirements,	 which you	 can	 use	 later	 on.	 Most	 of	 us	 solve	 our	 problems	 just	 fine,	 it’s	 just	 that	 we’ve never	thought	of	a	better	and	cheaper	way.  6.	 Most	conversations	come	to	a	natural	end.	Politely	thank	them	for	the	nice	talk	you had,	and	move	on	to	your	next	target.	Ideally,	get	a	business	card	that	you’ll	put	into your	CRM	or	follow-up	contact	app.  Why	should	you	do	this	exercise?	Well,	for	these	reasons:  1.	 You	 need	 to	 get	 used	 to	 talking	 with	 your	 prospect	 customers.	 Get	 in	 their	 heads,  make	yourself	familiar	with	their	contexts	and	vocabulary.  2.	 You	need	to	unsmart	yourself.	You’re	always	assuming	the	world	works	fine	as	it	is, but	 often	 existing	 solutions	 to	 problems	 are	 awful	 at	 best.	 Rewire	 your	 brain	 by assuming	everyone’s	lives	suck,	and	you’ll	see	plenty	of	opportunities	to	make	the world	a	better	place.  3.	 All	problems	start	with	people.	You	can’t	envision	a	grand	solution	to	a	world-class  problem	from	a	cubicle.	Get	out	there!  The	Chicken	And	The	Egg  You’re	 thinking	 “I’m	 not	 an	 App	 Maker,	 I	 have	 never	 built	 an	 app	 and	 I	 feel	 like	 an imposter.” If	you	don’t	believe	in	yourself	and	don’t	believe	that	you	can	ultimately	make	an	app, you’re	not	going	to	be	an	App	Maker.	Your	focus	determines	your	reality.	If	you	want	to be	an	App	Maker,	you	will	be. It’s	incredibly	easy	to	pick	up	any	skill,	thanks	to	online	education.	You	may	not	be	able	to become	a	astrophysicist	specialized	in	quantum	mechanics,	but	you	can	start	with	Physics 101! All	you	need	to	do	from	there,	is	add	1	building	block	to	your	skill:	Physics	102,	103,	and so	on.	You	don’t	need	to	be	a	math	prodigy	before	you	can	code	apps,	and	you	don’t	have to	sell	sand	to	a	camel	before	you	can	be	a	marketer. Start	at	square	zero,	and	work	your	way	up.	It’ll	be	easier,	quicker,	and	you’ll	perform better	that	way. And	you	should	know	that	there	are	plenty	of	camels	living	on	grassy	patches	that	long	for wide	warm	sands.	Never	assume	you	can’t	sell	snow	to	penguins.  Watch	Out	for	The	Genius	App	Idea	People  The	Genius	App	Idea	People	are	unfortunately	not	a	music	band,	and	if	they	were	they’d make	horrible	music.	The	Genius	App	Idea	People	are	those	who	approach	you	once	they hear	you’re	an	App	Maker	with	a	presumably	genius	idea	of	theirs. You’ll	know	‘em	when	you	see	‘em. If	someone	wants	you	to	sign	a	Non-Disclosure	Agreement	before	they	tell	you	an	idea,   run	away.	Unless	it’s	a	multi-million	dollar	industry	they	work	for,	run	away. What	if	someone	actually	has	a	good	idea?	Ask	them	the	following	3	questions,	and	hope for	good	answers.  “Is	it	already	in	the	App	Store?”	The	good	answer	is:	“I	have	looked	that	up	and made	a	marketing	plan	accordingly.”	Just	a	plain	yes	or	no	is	wrong,	because	your to-be	partner	didn’t	do	his	or	her	homework. “What	 is	 your	 added	 value	 for	 me?”	 The	 good	 answer	 is:	 “I’m	 working	 on	 the development,	or	on	the	design.”	The	absolute	super	wrong	answer	is:	“I	invented	it.” Why?	 A	 good	 idea	 is	 worth	 nothing	 if	 it’s	 not	 executed	 properly.	 You	 need	 a workforce,	not	a	feel-good	inventor. “What	 do	 you	 need	 me	 for,	 or	 what	 is	 my	 value	 to	 you?”	 The	 good	 answer	 is:	 “I provide	the	design	and	I	need	you	for	programming;	we	have	a	team	of	a	designer and	a	programmer	and	I	need	you	for	your	marketing	expertise.”  Idea	Sex  Problem-solving	is	something	different,	really.	It’s	hard	to	describe:	how	do	you	solve	a problem? You	just…	solve	it,	right? It	gets	to	you	in	the	weirdest	of	places:	on	the	toilet,	in	the	shower,	before	you	go	to	sleep, in	rush	hour,	on	your	way	to	the	supermarket,	etcetera. Solutions	 to	 problems	 have	 a	 way	 of	 creeping	 after	 us,	 hiding	 in	 plain	 sight,	 and	 then jumping	in	view	saying	“ALAKAZAM!	You	didn’t	see	me	coming,	did	you?” Any	system	that	produces	output	needs	input.	It’s	the	same	for	the	brain,	your	problem- solving	machine.	You	put	stuff	in,	and	solutions	come	out. What	do	you	put	in?	Ideas,	of	course! In	your	head,	the	ideas	then	have	sex	with	each	other.	No	other	word	for	it	is	as	striking	as idea	sex.	You	create	diamonds	that	way:	raw	materials	go	in,	you	compress	them,	and	out come	the	most	beautiful	structures	you	have	ever	seen:	ideas.	One	thought	collides	with another,	and	KABOOM	a	new	idea	is	formed. You	are	perfectly	capable	of	conceiving	great	ideas.	Let’s	look	at	a	few	ideation	methods. You’re	stuck	for	ideas,	caught	in	the	thick-of-thin	and	possibly	tired	of	planning	today’s activities.	Say	you	get	a	glass	of	water,	go	sit	on	the	couch	and	switch	on	the	TV. Wait…	switch	on	the	TV.	How? With	the	remote	control	of	course!	Thanks	to	the	infrared	LED	in	the	remote	control,	the TV	knows	what	button	you	pushed	and	switches	to	the	right	channel. Imagine	a	world	without	TV	remotes.	How	would	you	switch	on	the	TV,	and	pick	the	right channel?	We	know	how	this	happened,	so	the	answer	is	easy:	you’d	walk	over	to	the	TV and	push	a	few	buttons	to	get	it	on	the	right	channel.	It	works	OK,	right? Then	why	did	we	ever	invent	the	remote	control?	Because	its	inventor	 Nikola	Tesla,	to	be   precise 	asked	three	simple	questions:  How	do	we	usually	switch	on	our	TVs? Why	do	we	do	it	like	that? Is	there	a	simpler,	better,	more	productive	way?   For	 the	 sake	 of	 history,	 there	 were	 no	 TVs	 when	 Tesla	 lived.	 He	 pioneered	 the	 radio control	though,	in	a	demonstration	of	a	radio-controlled	boat.	The	first	battery-operated radio-controlled	FM AM	radio	was	available	to	consumers	around	1939.  Those	three	questions	form	the	cornerstone	of	critical	thinking	and	hold	all	the	potential for	generating	ideas.	As	a	thought	experiment,	try	to	ask	yourself	those	3	questions	in	the coming	days. First,	 define	 the	 workflow	  i.e.	 “switching	 TV	 channels” 	 of	 an	 existing	 problem.	 Can’t recall	any	issues,	problems	or	challenges?	Feed	your	thoughts	with	these	questions:  What	frustrated	me	today?	 I.e.	the	copier,	your	spouse,	the	lawnmower.  What	activity	today	went	completely	well,	without	a	hitch? What	 mistakes	 did	 I	 make	 today,	 and	 what	 kind	 of	 prior	 knowledge	 or	 tool	 could have	avoided	it?  Then,	when	you’ve	identified	the	task	or	workflow	that’s	at	fault,	ask	the	3	Nikola	Tesla questions	 How?	Why?	Simpler,	better,	more	productive?  Still	 stuck	 for	 ideas?	 The	 key	 of	 this	 exercise	 is	 to	 think	 outside	 the	 box,	 to	 lose	 your reference	 frame	 for	 a	 bit	 and	 literally	 wonder	 about.	 If	 you’re	 having	 trouble	 escaping reality,	try	this:  Get	to	a	place	you	frequent	everyday,	and	look	up.	What	do	you	see? Push	a	button	you’re	not	supposed	to	push.	 Try	not	to	harm	anyone	or	anything . When	walking,	stop	in	your	tracks,	turn	around	and	look	at	what	was	behind	you. Count	all	the	red	 or	green,	blue,	yellow 	things	you	can	see	and	name	them.	Seeing something	out	of	the	ordinary?  Try	the	above	exercises	for	a	couple	of	days,	and	write	down	any	realizations	you	have. Could	you	identify	a	problem	somewhere,	something	that’s	not	going	as	well	as	it	should? Awesome!	You’ve	just	identified	a	problem	and	thought	about	a	possible	solution	for	it.  What’s	A	Great	App	Idea?  Now	 that	 you’ve	 generated	 a	 couple	 ideas,	 it’s	 time	 to	 identify	 the	 good	 and	 the	 great ones.	In	general	we	can	say	that,	based	on	the	previous	paragraph,	any	idea	that’s	good	is one	that	solves	a	problem.	But	what	makes	a	great	idea? See	if	you	can	categorize	your	idea	into	one	of	the	following	categories:  The	“X-for-Y”.	It’s	applying	one	concept	you	already	know	to	a	problem	or	situation in	which	this	concept	is	unknown.	Examples:	transporting	passengers	for	non-taxi’s    Uber ,	 mass	 organization	 for	 discount	 coupons	  Groupon ,	 super-fast	 filtering	 of potential	dates	for	single	people	 Tinder . The	 “Wouldn’t	 it	 be	 cool	 if	 we	 had	 …”.	 These	 are	 ideas	 that	 don’t	 fit	 in	 any category,	 but	 are	 categories	 on	 their	 own.	 They’re	 new,	 far-out	 and	 often technologically	impossible.	Of	course,	nothing	is	impossible.	Examples:	commercial spaceflight	  SpaceX ,	 ubiquitous	 electricity	  Edison ,	 self-aware	 and	 thinking computers	 not	available,	so	far . The	 “Significant	 Improvement”.	 It’s	 finding	 one	 little	 gear	 in	 a	 system	 that’s underperforming,	and	changing	it	to	increase	the	output	of	that	system	by	a	1000%	or more.	Examples:	the	remote	control	 Nikola	Tesla ,	electric	cars	 Elon	Musk Tesla , TV	dinner	 Swanson	&	Sons .  Of	course,	there	are	many	more	categories	of	ideas.	Let’s	just	stick	with	these	for	a	while. In	the	above	examples,	did	you	notice	none	those	ideas	were	truly	unique	at	the	time	of invention?  TV	dinner	is	just	prepackaged	microwaveable	food. Electricity	and	even	the	light	bulb	were	invented	before	Edison	started	building	his power	generators	and	distributors. Man	sent	stuff	to	the	moon	way	before	Elon	Musk	was	born.  In	essence,	the	word	“idea”	can	be	interchanged	freely	with	the	word	“solution”.	In	that sense,	there	are	no	good	ideas	and	no	bad	ones:	there	are	only	solutions	to	problems.	But then,	what’s	a	good	solution?	In	a	business	sense,	or	in	the	app	industry,	a	good	solution	is one	that	people	are	willing	to	pay	money	for,	an	exchange	of	currency	for	value. A	 good	 idea	 doesn’t	 need	 to	 be	 unique	 and	 uniqueness	 often	 doesn’t	 add	 anything	 in value.	In	business	you	sometimes	want	to	be	the	“first	mover”	 i.e.	the	one	who	came	up with	 a	 unique	 solution	 first ,	 but	 being	 and	 not	 being	 a	 first	 mover	 has	 advantages	 and disadvantages	that	do	not	make	one	greater	than	the	other.  Resources  Contextual	Design	by	Hugh	Beyer	and	Karen	Holtzblatt	It’s	almost	a	classic.

A	 lot	 of	 app	 entrepreneurs	 go	 from	 idea	 straight	 to	 implementation.	 They	 think	 their solution	to	a	problem	is	the	bees	knees	and	in	all	the	excitement	forget	to	validate	it	first. What’s	validation?	It’s	simple:	validation	means	you	verify	that	there’s	actual	customers willing	to	pay	for	your	product. Don’t	mistake	validation	for	asking	for	feedback	and	getting	a	positive	response.	When you	ask	someone	what	they	think	of	your	idea,	many	people	will	tell	you	that	they	think it’s	a	great	idea.	That’s	not	because	the	idea	is	in	fact	good,	but	just	because	it’s	our	social norm	to	applaud	and	praise	entrepreneurship,	initiative,	and	creativity. Also,	 in	 a	 problem-solution	 situation	 many	 people	 will	 simply	 tell	 you	 your	 solution	 is good	 because	 they	 can	 logically	 see	 that	 it	 solves	 the	 problem.	 Solving	 problems	 alone isn’t	going	to	bring	in	money;	you	need	paying	customers	to	let	your	business	thrive.  Why	Didn’t	You	Validate?  Your	excuses	for	not	validating:  1.	 I	know	the	market,	I	know	what	sells	and	what	doesn’t 2.	 I’m	just	the	developer,	it’s	X’s	responsibility 3.	 I	started	building	immediately,	and	now	it’s	too	late	to	validate 4.	 Everyone	I	talk	to	tells	me	it’s	a	great	idea,	so	it	must	be! 5.	 I	tried	X	and	Y	before,	so	now	I’m	doing	the	opposite	because	that	works 6.	 The	idea	is	unique	and	technologically	advanced,	people	will	want	this 7.	 I	see	developers	become	App	Store	millionaires	every	day,	I’ll	just	publish	the	app  and	see	the	money	pour	in  Unfortunately,	all	this	is	wrong!	You’re	mistaking	validation	for	a	great	many	things,	but don’t	see	it	for	what	it	is:	getting	rid	of	assumptions,	and	testing	the	real-world	market. Knowing	what	sells	and	what	doesn’t	may	give	you	a	hunch	in	which	direction	to	build your	business.	There’s	no	point	in	selling	non-sticky	glue,	carrying	water	to	the	sea,	or trying	to	build	a	ladder	to	the	moon.	Business	sense	will	direct	your	ideas,	but	it	cannot substitute	proper	validation. Saying	it’s	someone	elses	responsibility	is	dangerous.	Make	sure	your	co-founders	know that	they’re	in	charge	of	validating	the	business,	because	otherwise	you’re	all	just	pointing at	each	other.	If	you’re	close	to	the	end-users	of	your	business,	you	should	take	part	in validation.	Often,	the	developer	of	an	app	also	builds	the	UX	and	UI.	In	that	case,	you need	to	be	on	the	validation	team,	because	your	design	decisions	impact	the	end	user. It’s	never	fun	to	admit	your	mistakes,	especially	when	it	involves	time	and	resources	you could	have	spent	elsewhere.	When	you’re	working	on	a	project	and	you	realize	it’s	not working,	 verify	 that	 you’re	 right.	 Maybe	 you’re	 one	 day	 away	 from	 a	 breakthrough,	 or   maybe	 you’re	 completely	 on	 the	 wrong	 track.	 Either	 way:	 validate	 before	 making	 a decision.	And	don’t	be	afraid	of	a	“sunk	cost”.	The	fact	that	you	started	doesn’t	mean	you must	go	on. Friends	 and	 family	 will	 often	 tell	 you	 your	 idea	 is	 great.	 Depending	 on	 your	 cultural background,	people	around	you	either	praise	your	entrepreneurship	and	proactivity,	or	tell you	 to	 “just	 be	 ordinary”.	 No	 response	 is	 a	 good	 representation	 of	 business,	 because	 a person’s	 response	 is	 subjective	 and	 personal.	 It’s	 a	 validation	 of	 social	 norms,	 current context	and	a	product	of	your	interpersonal	relationships.	We	all	want	to	hear	we’re	on	the right	track,	but	the	people	around	us	 those	who	aren’t	customers 	have	no	significant	say in	the	success	of	an	app. When	you’ve	been	in	business	before,	you	pick	up	skills	and	knowledge	naturally.	Often, future	 businesses	 rely	 on	 expertise	 you’re	 gathering	 today.	 Sometimes	 this	 makes	 you oblivious	to	change,	be	it	intentionally	or	not.	The	world	around	you	changes,	and	what was	true	a	year	or	10	ago,	isn’t	true	anymore.	Being	an	educated	expert	doesn’t	mean	you know	a	lot,	it	means	you	can	admit	that	you	don’t	know	anything. Uniqueness	 of	 an	 idea	 doesn’t	 matter.	 In	 business,	 uniqueness	 just	 makes	 you	 a	 “first- mover”.	 That	 has	 advantages	 and	 disadvantages,	 but	 it	 doesn’t	 say	 anything	 about profitability	or	future	success.	Your	idea	being	remarkable	will	go	a	long	way,	but	cannot serve	as	a	substitute	for	a	business	funded	with	validation.	The	same	goes	for	technology; building	something	cool	will	only	get	you	so	far.	Often,	a	uniqueness	and	coolness	distract from	the	factors	that	make	an	idea	successful.	If	you	don’t	pick	up	on	those	factors,	you can’t	repeat	your	success. Yes,	 people	 become	 millionaires	 every	 day.	 It	 appears	 as	 if	 they	 have	 reached	 success overnight.	What	you	don’t	see	is	the	iceberg	below	the	water	surface:	the	years	of	hard work	that	led	to	this	breakthrough.	We	can’t	say	with	confidence	that	we	can	predict	the path	 of	 success	 before	 it	 happens,	 and	 likewise	 you	 can’t	 reverse-predict	 success	 from hearing	a	story.	We	think	that	what	we	see	is	success,	when	in	fact	it’s	careful	planning, smart	 and	 hard	 work,	 and	 an	 awful	 lot	 of	 determination.	 Don’t	 try	 to	 cheat	 success	 by assuming	someone,	or	something,	will	do	the	magic	for	you.  Assuming	Is	A	Form	Of	Laziness  Remember	this:	assuming	is	a	form	of	laziness.	Why?	Because	if	you	assume,	you	don’t verify.	You	forget	one	step	because	you’re	too	lazy,	stubborn	or	arrogant	to	validate	your ideas. But	 what	 if	 you’re	 a	 go-getter,	 a	 risk-taker,	 a	 ninja	 or	 rockstar	 developer?	 Yes, unfortunately	the	rules	of	gravity	apply	to	you	too.	Nothing	beats	good	validation. When	talking	about	“risk”,	you	can	also	talk	about	fear.	When	you	fear	something,	you risk	something	too.	See,	a	spider	could	bite	you.	That’s	fear	and	risk	right	there.	Likewise, air	travel	with	a	plane	scares	many	people	too.	Then,	heart	disease	kills	many	more	people than	air	travel.	It’s	safer	to	jump	out	of	an	airplane,	than	to	eat	a	hamburger. Humans,	 even	 statisticians,	 are	 awfully	 bad	 at	 making	 well-informed	 chance	 decisions based	on	stories	 or	“narratives” .	We	see	the	logic	in	a	story	 an	airplane	crash	kills 	and   overestimate	the	chances	of	it	occuring	to	us. In	general,	we	know	two	kinds	of	risk:  Immediate	risk,	often	associated	with	“rational	fear”,	portrayed	by	consequence	that follows	 the	 risky	 action	 immediately:	 jumping	 of	 a	 cliff	  fear	 of	 height 	 or	 fleeing from	a	tiger	 fear	of	injury . Deferred	risk,	often	associated	with	“irrational	fear”,	portrayed	by	consequence	that doesn’t	 follow	 the	 risky	 action	 immediately:	 flying	 on	 an	 airplane,	 unemployment, terrorism	and	diseases.  We	can	assess	the	risk	and	consequence	of	immediate	actions,	but	often	fail	at	ascertaining the	risk	of	low-chance	consequences.	We’re	too	afraid	of	things	that	will	never	happen, and	not	afraid	of	things	that	will	happen	a	long	time	from	now. What	does	this	have	to	do	with	apps? You	 should	 be	 afraid	 of	 not	 validating	 your	 business,	 in	 the	 same	 way	 you’re	 afraid	 of heights	 when	 jumping	 out	 of	 an	 airplane	  when	 skydiving .	 Unfortunately,	 you’re hardwired	 to	 think	 that	 your	 business	 won’t	 go	 bankrupt.	 It’s	 just	 too	 far	 away,	 out	 of sight,	and	it	takes	a	long	time	to	get	to	bankruptcy. Unfortunately,	when	you	base	your	business	on	wrong	assumptions,	bankruptcy	is	right around	the	corner.	It’s	inevitable,	it	just	takes	a	long	time	to	get	there. In	 essence,	 by	 validation	 you	 pull	 failure	 nearer	 to	 yourself.	 You	 replace	 long-term bankruptcy	by	short-term	and	temporary	failure.	The	former	is	worse	than	the	latter.	When people	say	“Fail,	fail	again,	fail	better”	they	really	mean:	“fail	soon,	fail	often”.	Only	by testing	your	assumptions	can	you	replace	deferred	consequences	with	calculated	risk. Business	involves	a	fair	share	of	risk.	Many	successful	entrepreneurs	are	famous	because they	took	risks,	and	did	not	shy	away	from	it.	What	most	people	don’t	know	is	that	these entrepreneurs	never	really	took	the	risk,	because	they	calculated	their	chance	of	occuring. They	protected	the	downside,	gave	space	to	the	upside,	and	stayed	true	to	their	course. Assuming	is	a	form	of	laziness!  Do	The	Work:	Researching	Ideas  As	an	App	Maker,	you	can’t	objectively	determine	the	impact	of	an	idea.	You	have	no	idea how	the	market	behaves,	and	where	the	customer	is.	Researching	is	a	good	way	to	answer questions	 before	 spending	 time	 on	 validation.	 Don’t	 mistake	 proper	 research	 with validation!	Research	filters	out	the	bad	ideas,	but	it	doesn’t	mean	what’s	left	are	the	good and	successful	ideas. OK,	let’s	say	you	have	three	ideas:  1.	 An	 app	 that	 tracks	 your	 fitness	 workout	 progress.	 You	 can	 select	 an	 exercise,	 and input	 the	 number	 of	 sets	 and	 repetitions	 you	 did.	 The	 app	 then	 shows	 you	 your progression	over	time,	graphically.  2.	 An	app	that	counts	impacts.	Based	on	sound	data	it	counts	and	records	impacts,	for   instance	on	a	fighting	bag	 used	in	kickboxing,	sharpshooting,	anything	that	needs counting	of	sound	impact .	The	app	shows	you	how	fast	your	combos	are,	or	how	fast you	reload	a	firearm.  3.	 An	app	with	inspirational	quotes.	It’s	fancy,	hipster-y	and	shows	you	a	famous	quote  every	day,	meant	to	inspire	you.  Discovery	And	Keywords  These	days,	clever	mechanisms	are	present	in	the	tools	we	use	to	discover	new	products. In	the	App	Store,	an	algorithm	determines	which	apps	show	up	when	a	user	searches	for	it with	 the	 search	 function.	 Likewise,	 Google	 Search	 determines	 your	 interest	 based	 on previous	searches,	and	Spotify	and	Netflix	suggest	new	titles	based	on	metadata	between purchases. In	general,	these	tools	use	three	kinds	of	data	to	come	up	with	relevant	results:  Search	keywords	 i.e.	words	that	the	user	puts	in  Metadata,	often	tags,	that	connect	products	internally	 i.e.	movie	genre  Behavioural	 data,	 such	 as	 conversions	 and	 interactions	  i.e.	 the	 movies	 that	 you watched,	as	opposed	to	the	suggested-but-not-watched   When	 researching	 app	 ideas,	 you	 should	 pay	 close	 attention	 to	 keywords.	 They’re	 the direct	input	for	app	discovery	and	it’s	the	no.	1	metric	you	use	to	rank	your	app. Using	keywords	you	can	get	insight	into	the	viability	of	an	idea,	and	at	the	same	time	look into	the	minds	of	potential	customers. With	a	tool	like	Long	Tail	Pro,	you	can	gather	actual	search	data	from	search	engines	like Google	 Search.	 Although	 Google	 Search	 doesn’t	 immediately	 influence	 App	 Store rankings	and	doesn’t	tap	into	search	data	from	the	App	Store,	it	gives	good	insight	into how	people	search	for	your	product. In	Long	Tail	Pro	you	enter	a	few	seed	search	terms.	For	the	fitness	app	you	would	enter “fitness	app”	and	“fitness	tracker”.	The	tool	thencomes	up	with	the	a	bunch	of	keyword ideas. When	you	sort	the	results	on	local	and	global	search	volume,	you	can	ascertain	the	market. With	many	tools,	you	can	even	check	the	amount	competition.	This	is	based	on	Google Search	advertising	of	course,	but	it	does	give	an	idea	about	the	size	of	the	market	and	the amount	of	competition	 a	lot	of	competition	isn’t	always	bad . The	metrics	for	a	bad	business	or	idea,	are:  No	search	results A	small	market	size Too	much	competition	on	specific	terms	 as	opposed	to	broad	terms  Keywords	that	appear	to	be	non-sensical	or	irrelevant  OK,	now	let’s	tap	these	new	keywords	into	a	tool	that	does	 work	 with	 App	 Store	 data: AppAnnie.   Create	 an	 account	 on	 AppAnnie.com	 and	 go	 to	 the	 https:  www.appannie.com apps all- stores keyword-top 	page. On	this	page,	you	can	enter	a	keyword	and	see	the	search	results	that	would	have	come	up had	you	searched	the	App	Store.	Essentially,	it	mimics	the	search	results	of	the	App	Store for	the	search	terms	you	enter. With	it,	you	can	find	out:  A	great	deal	about	your	competition:	how	many	there	are,	what	their	features	are,	and how	they	rank. The	kind	of	words	users	use	to	search,	just	like	Long	Tail	Pro.	It’s	a	little	bit	more hidden,	but	all	top	apps	include	well-ranking	keywords	in	their	app	titles. How	 well	 top	 ranking	 apps	 do,	 in	 terms	 of	 pretty	 design,	 features,	 amount	 of downloads,	reviews,	etc.	Ascertaining	whether	a	successful	app	can	be	beaten	is	the most	important	step	in	creating	an	app	that	already	exists.  When	 a	 search	 returns	 no	 results,	 it	 either	 means	 no	 one	 searches	 for	 it,	 or	 AppAnnie simply	has	no	data	on	it. It’s	easy	to	see	that	none	of	our	three	apps	are	significantly	great	ideas:  1.	 The	fitness	app	has	killer	competition.	There	are	a	lot	of	downloads	in	the	Top	10, and	even	the	Top	100	holds	apps	by	big	players.	They	appear	to	all	rank	on	3-6	of	the same	keywords,	not	leaving	much	space	for	new	entrants.  2.	 The	“impact	app”	doesn’t	have	any	direct	searches,	but	searching	for	adjacent	terms like	“muay	thai”	or	“boxing”	shows	a	number	of	apps	that	include	timers.	None	of them	 use	 automated	 counting	 of	 impacts.	 Searching	 Google	 reveals	 that	 there	 are expensive	hardware	tools	that	can	count	gunshot	sounds,	so	an	app	might	be	a	good cross-over	between	the	two.  3.	 The	quotes	app	has	a	lot	of	competition	too.	There	are	plenty	of	them	that	include	the  words	“quote”	and	“inspiration”.  Is	that	all?	No,	this	is	where	the	fun	starts! See,	it	may	seem	that	all	of	these	app	ideas	are	bad.	In	their	current	form	they	are,	so	that’s why	we’re	going	to	pivot	the	ideas.	In	general,	after	doing	a	keyword	analysis	of	an	idea, you	have	three	options:  Refining	Your	Ideas  1.	 Advance	the	idea 2.	 Abandon	the	idea 3.	 Pivot	the	idea  Advancing	 simply	 means	 you’ll	 continue	 researching,	 but	 your	 general	 idea	 is	 sound. Abandoning	 of	 course	 means	 you’ll	 stop	 with	 the	 idea,	 and	 won’t	 attempt	 any	 further research	or	development.	Pivoting	means	your	idea	is	sound,	but	it	needs	refining.   Refining	can	be	done	in	a	couple	of	ways:  Niching	 down.	 You	 may	 have	 heard	 about	 a	 “niche”;	 it’s	 a	 specific	 market	 that	 is interested	 in	 a	 particular	 topic	 or	 product.	 You	 have	 niches	 of	 all	 kinds	 and	 sizes, from	specialty	coffee	beans	to	music	genres	no	one	has	ever	heard	of.	Often,	you	can apply	a	general	big	size	idea	to	a	niche.	Like	“financial	planning”	for	“startups”.	You can’t	take	on	either	of	those	big	terms,	but	by	combining	you	have	a	shot	at	serving	a bigger	 portion	 of	 a	 smaller	 market	  instead	 of	 an	 insignificant	 share	 of	 a	 huge market . Applying	 one	 principle	 or	 paradigm	 to	 a	 new	 market.	 Often,	 products	 exist	 in	 one market	but	are	unknown	in	another.	By	adapting	the	product	to	a	new	market,	simply re-fitting	 it,	 you	 can	 transmute	 a	 successful	 business	 idea	 from	 one	 market	 to	 the next.  When	you’ve	pivoted	or	changed	your	idea,	you	research	the	options	again.  Defining	Your	Target	Audience  OK,	now	that	we	have	an	initial	idea	that’s	properly	researched	we	can	move	on	to	the next	step.	It’s	simple:	you	need	to	get	to	know	your	customers.	Before	you	can	do	that, you	need	to	know	who	they	are. Let’s	start	with	one	of	the	ideas	we	had	before:  The	Fitness	Tracker The	Impact	Counter The	Quotes	App  Then,	ask	yourself	this	question:	“Why	would	people	use	or	buy	my	app?” Well…	because	they’re	into	workouts,	right? No,	 wrong	 answer.	 Because	 they’re	 bored	 by	 always	 writing	 down	 their	 sets	 and repetitions? Yes,	good	one.	Bored,	or	maybe	they	don’t	have	the	time	and	attention	to	do	it?	OK.	That points	to:	time	saving,	not	forgetting,	ease	of	mind,	etc. Now,	ask	again.	Why	do	they	use	your	app	for	saving	time? Hmm…	because	the	app	is	cool,	easy	to	use,	pretty,	fast,	available	for	all	platforms.	NO! WRONG!	You’re	just	listing	features,	not	benefits.	Features,	or	the	characteristics	of	the app	won’t	sell	it.	They’re	important;	ease	of	use	is	as	important	as	air,	but	it’s	not	a	selling point. OK,	OK.	Why? They	buy	the	app	because	it’s	sold	to	them	in	the	right	context.	For	instance	when	they	are working	out	or	they	are	thinking	about	working	out. Yes,	now	we’re	getting	somewhere.	But	why…	?   If	you	use	this	method	you	can	quickly	move	down	into	different	paths	of	your	business. By	 continuously	 asking	 “Why?”	 you’re	 looking	 into	 what	 motivates	 a	 user	 to	 buy	 and install	your	app. Go	where	your	customers	are	already	looking.	That’s	good	marketing	advice,	but	it’s	also great	for	finding	your	target	audience.	Ask	yourself:	“How	is	the	problem	I’m	trying	to solve	currently	being	solved?”	If	you	can	answer	that	question	with	a	place,	you’re	on	the right	track	for	finding	your	target	audience. Go	to	this	place,	and	observe	the	people.	Use	these	questions:  How	are	my	prospect	customers	solving	their	problem? What	do	they	look	like,	where	are	they	from,	to	which	demographic	do	they	belong? What’s	the	easiest	way	I	can	reach	them? What’s	the	cheapest	way	I	can	reach	them? What’s	the	most	scalable	way	I	can	reach	them?  Answering	these	questions	will	give	you	a	picture	of	your	target	audience,	and	will	most likely	help	you	define	your	audience	better.  Now	that	we’ve	properly	deepened	the	understanding	of	our	ideas,	we	can	look	into	the actual	validation	itself.	Let’s	look	at	three	different	methods.  Validation	Techniques  Pay	It	Before	You	Get	It  Pay	It	Before	You	Get	It	is	exactly	what	it	says	it	is:	you	pay	for	a	product	before	you	get it.	It’s	well	known	as	crowd	funding,	or	pitching	an	idea	to	a	crowd	and	asking	them	to pledge	money	for	the	realization	of	the	idea. While	true	crowd	funding	is	a	business	model	on	its	own,	using	it	on	a	smaller	scale	is extremely	viable	for	validating	a	business	idea. This	is	what	you	do:  1.	 Create	a	sales	page	for	your	solution,	explaining	how	it	works	and	how	it	benefits	a potential	customer.	Sell	it	if	you	were	selling	the	real	thing,	including	videos	of	actual use	and	screenshots	of	the	app.  2.	 Publish	the	page	online,	so	potential	customers	can	see	it.	You	can	use	LeadPages,  Strikingly	or	WordPress	to	quickly	setup	a	web	page.  3.	 Include	a	call-to-action	on	the	page,	like	“Buy	Now”	or	“Sign	Up”.	When	they	click on	the	button,	they	won’t	see	a	product	checkout	page	but	instead	have	the	option	to leave	their	email	address	to	get	notified	when	the	product	is	ready.  Based	on	the	people	that	leave	their	email	address,	you	can	measure	if	there’s	a	potential market	for	your	solution.	You	can	even	get	in	touch	with	them	and	refine	your	offering. Keep	those	potential	customers	in	the	loop	about	the	development	of	your	app,	and	try	to   turn	them	into	ambassadors.	Someone	who’s	excited	about	your	business	can	bring	in	new customers.  Create	A	Low-Tech	Product  Let’s	say	we’re	going	to	build	a	product	for	fitness	gym	visitors.	Often,	when	people	go	to the	gym,	they	take	a	notepad	with	them	that	says	what	exercises	they	have	to	do.	They mark	their	sets	and	repetitions	on	the	notepad	to	track	their	progress	over	time.	What	if there	was	an	app	for	that? Instead	of	building	the	entire	app,	let’s	make	a	minimum	viable	product	instead.	You	may have	heard	the	term.	An	MVP	is	the	bare-bones	version	of	your	app,	the	most	minimal version	that	still	does	what	it’s	supposed	to	do:	solve	a	problem. Often,	 app	 publishers	 mistake	 MVP	 for	 minimum	 product.	 They	 still	 build	 the	 app	 but leave	 out	 all	 the	 features,	 making	 it	 a	 very	 shallow	 product.	 The	 key	 point	 in	 MVP	 is viable.	Make	a	product	that	still	works	and	solves	a	problem.	A	low-input	high-output	way of	making	an	MVP	is	stripping	away	all	technology.	You	just	want	to	know	if	someone’s willing	to	pay	for	it,	right? In	case	of	the	fitness	app,	you’d	do	this:  1.	 Go	to	the	gym	with	a	friend. 2.	 Pitch	your	friend	your	product.	Tell	him	you’ll	track	his	progress	for	him	and	that	he doesn’t	have	to	count	his	sets	and	reps	on	his	own.	Tell	your	friend	it’s	going	to	cost him	$	3	and	it’s	OK	if	he	doesn’t	want	it.  3.	 If	he	agrees,	do	the	exercises	with	your	friend.	Count	his	sets	and	reps	and	mark	them  on	the	notepad.  4.	 When	done,	give	the	notepad	back	and	get	your	money.  You’ve	just	validated	the	business!	Repeat	the	process	with	a	couple	of	more	friends,	or even	with	a	random	stranger	at	the	gym.	Get	the	gym’s	consent	first,	though. The	cool	thing	about	the	low-tech	product	is	that	by	taking	away	the	technology	you	get creative.	 Technology	 in	 a	 product	 often	 lives	 a	 life	 of	 its	 own,	 and	 you	 start	 making technological	solutions	to	problems	that	weren’t	even	there. Consider	these	pivots	that	you	can	try	out	in	10	minutes:  Instead	 of	 helping	 your	 friend,	 help	 the	 fitness	 instructor.	 He’s	 got	 one	 of	 those notepads	too,	and	you	can	save	him	or	her	time	and	trouble	by	noting	the	sets	and reps	of	students. Ask	your	friend	for	feedback	after	the	purchase.	What	did	they	like?	What	didn’t	they like?	You	can’t	talk	to	an	app,	but	you	can	talk	to	a	friend. Don’t	 charge	 anything,	 but	 survey	 your	 customer	 after	 the	 purchase.	 How	 much would	they	have	paid	for	the	service?  Start	A	Joint-Venture   If	you	need	to	position	each	of	the	three	methods	for	validating	a	business	 Pay	Before, MVP	 and	 Joint-Venture 	 on	 a	 scale	 between	 idea	 and	 actual	 product,	 a	 joint-venture	 is closest	to	the	actual	product	and	Pay	Before	You	Get	It	is	farthest	away.	Starting	a	joint- venture	may	seem	like	the	quickest	path	from	idea	to	product,	but	if	your	idea	is	full	of holes	it’s	actually	the	most	effective	to	fire	up	a	sales	page	and	get	customer	feedback. Still,	if	you’re	sure	your	idea	is	going	to	hit	it	out	of	the	park:	start	a	joint-venture! A	joint-venture	is	nothing	more	than	getting	a	partner	in	the	business	and	dividing	costs and	 revenue	 between	 you	 and	 the	 partner.	 It	 could	 be	 that	 they	 take	 on	 all	 the	 costs	 of developments	and	pay	out	an	inventor’s	fee	to	you,	or	that	you	split	50-50	and	both	reap the	profits. Starting	a	joint-venture,	in	simple	steps,	means	this:  1.	 Set	 up	 a	 pitch	 for	 your	 product,	 through	 a	 speaker	 deck,	 a	 brochure	 or	 an	 entire business	 plan.	 Make	 it	 compelling,	 outlining	 the	 costs	 and	 benefits,	 the	 risks	 and rewards,	and	the	role	you	expect	your	partner	to	take.  2.	 Find	a	potential	business	partner.	It	may	be	someone	you	know,	or	someone	you	can  meet	through	an	introduction	of	a	mutual	friend	or	associate.  3.	 Pitch	the	product.	If	the	partner	is	interested,	you	can	work	out	the	details	from	there.  If	he	or	she	isn’t	interested,	go	on	and	find	someone	who	is.  Depending	 on	 the	 sensitivity	 of	 the	 invention,	 you	 may	 want	 to	 work	 with	 a	 Non- Disclosure	Agreement	or	file	a	patent	yourself.	You	can’t	patent	apps,	though. The	potential	upside	of	working	with	a	JV	is	that	your	partner	has	access	to	a	network	of their	own.	Together,	you	can	bring	your	invention	to	a	wider	audience	by	leveraging	the extended	reach	of	the	partner.

About	Building	A	Network	And	The	Hilarity	That	Ensued  Back	in	2011	I	signed	up	for	an	incubator	in	Utrecht,	The	Netherlands.	For	half	a	year	I got	coached	as	an	entrepreneur,	working	on	one	of	my	app	businesses.	One	of	the	things	I learned,	is	this:	get	out	there	and	rely	on	your	network	to	make	your	business	thrive.	This story	is	a	personal	account	of	how	I	came	to	that	realization. It’s	the	quickest	road	towards	failure:	not	asking	for	feedback.	Many	entrepreneurs,	me included,	sit	in	their	ivory	tower	and	think	they	can	change	the	world.	An	idea,	an	app,	a business,	they	all	need	shaping	and	refining.	You	can’t	do	that	on	your	own,	you	have	to ask	others	for	their	opinions	on	your	masterpiece. Often,	the	people	you	ask	for	feedback	come	up	with	great	additions.	You	hadn’t	thought of	them,	because	you’re	so	deep	into	the	ideation	of	your	product,	making	you	oblivious	to obvious	thought. In	 the	 past	 years	 as	 an	 entrepreneur,	 I’ve	 gotten	 into	 quite	 a	 few	 hilarious	 and	 odd situations.	Let’s	say	I	made	these	mistakes,	so	you	don’t	have	to:  Got	 invited	 to	 a	 fancy	 dinner	 as	 a	 +1	 with	 one	 of	 my	 clients.	 There	 were	 lots	 of courses,	tuxedos	and	“important”	people.	We	switched	places	every	course	to	keep the	conversation	going.	One	time,	I	sat	across	a	man	I	didn’t	know.	So,	I	ask:	“And what	 do	 you	 do?”	 Turns	 out	 he’s	 the	 CEO	 of	 the	 company	 that	 threw	 the	 dinner. Oops! Another	time,	I	had	a	meeting	at	a	prospect	buyer.	The	meet	was	just	across	town,	so I	got	on	my	bike	and	cycled	over.	While	cycling,	it	poured	down	from	the	heavens like	crazy.	When	I	got	to	the	prospect’s	building,	I	was	soaked,	there	was	literally	no dry	 spot	 on	 me	 left.	 When	 I	 entered	 the	 building,	 the	 security	 guard	 burst	 out	 in laughter	and	handed	me	a	towel.	“Can’t	let	you	in	like	that”,	he	said.	Fortunately,	the prospect	could	laugh	about	it	too. I	once	met	a	future	client	at	a	summer	festival.	We	both	smelled	of	beer	and	campsite, hadn’t	 showered	 for	 days,	 but	 had	 the	 best	 time	 of	 our	 lives.	 I	 later	 found	 out	 he worked	for	a	famous	fashion	brand	and	was	looking	for	an	app	developer.	Not	long after,	I	went	to	work	for	the	company.  The	 first	 step	 in	 building	 a	 business,	 is	 building	 a	 network.	 A	 network	 is	 nothing	 more than	 a	 bunch	 of	 people	 you	 know	 and	 can	 rely	 on.	 You	 can	 ask	 them	 for	 feedback, introductions,	recommendations,	or	have	a	chat	every	now	and	then. There’s	 no	 easier	 way	 than	 to	 build	 a	 network	 by	 providing	 value	 for	 others.	 It’s	 a common	 mistake	 to	 assume	 you	 “consume”	 this	 network	 by	 asking	 favors.	 It’s	 not	 like that;	people	simply	want	to	see	you	succeed.	Asking	for	a	favor	opens	the	door	for	more favors.	Based	on	the	concept	of	reciprocity	you	yourself	are	likely	to	help	in	return	too. It’s	hard	to	get	started	with	building	a	network.	To	get	you	going:  Go	to	Meetup.com	and	look	for	networking	events	in	your	area.	Pick	a	topic	you’re interested	in,	put	on	some	nice	shoes	and	start	talking	to	people.	It’s	often	fun,	you get	to	meet	new	people	and	with	the	right	attitude,	you’ll	know	when	an	interesting   opportunity	 presents	 itself.	 Remember:	 providing	 value	 is	 key	 to	 a	 healthy relationship. Look	 at	 your	 closest	 friends.	 They	 say	 you’re	 5	 to	 7	 “hops”	 away	 from	 a	 famous person,	5	links	between	you	and	Barack	Obama	or	Bill	Gates.	There’s	gotta	be	some interesting	people,	and	companies,	between	you	and	those	famous	people.	Create	a map	of	your	friends,	relatives,	colleagues	and	find	out	how	beneficial	your	network can	be. In	 marketing,	 they	 always	 say:	 “Go	 where	 your	 customers	 already	 are.”	 For networking,	 it’s	 no	 different.	 Find	 groups	 of	 people,	 online	 and	 offline,	 who	 are already	 centered	 around	 a	 topic	 of	 interest.	 Join	 the	 group,	 provide	 value	 and	 let organic	networking	do	the	rest.  During	my	time	at	the	incubator,	working	on	the	app	business,	I	met	with	a	few	dozen people	to	talk	about	the	app.	Usually,	I	would	get	an	introduction	through	my	network	to interesting	companies.	I’d	pitch	the	app	idea	to	the	company	to	get	invaluable	feedback about	the	product	I	was	building. Initially,	it	didn’t	go	too	well.	When	meeting	the	person	I	was	discussing	the	idea	with would	criticize	the	idea,	shoot	it	down,	and	downright	reject	it	as	a	potentially	profitable business.	I	found	that	very	demotivating,	but	still	wanted	to	get	valuable	feedback	out	of it.	Thanks	to	the	frustration,	I	often	dismissed	the	criticism,	throwing	away	anything	good that	might	have	come	from	it. How	did	I	resolve	this	pattern?  When	meeting,	I’d	first	pitch	the	rough	30-second	version	of	the	product.	Usually,	I’d get	negative	unconstructive	feedback	rightaway.	I	would	listen	closely,	writing	down sensible	points.	Unconstructive	feedback	would	go	into	my	right	ear,	and	then	out	the left. When	the	negative	feedback	cleared,	I’d	start	firing	questions.	I	would	involve	them in	 the	 creation	 of	 the	 product,	 benefiting	 from	 what	 they	 know	 about	 the	 market, business,	design,	and	development. Ultimately,	I’d	recap	what	we	had	talked	about,	reinforcing	the	most	important	parts of	the	conversation.  What	 changed?	 I	 found	 out	 that	 people	 who	 give	 you	 negative	 feedback	 think	 they’re helping	you,	but	it’s	you	who	experiences	the	feedback	as	negative	or	unconstructive.	By listening,	a	person	feels	heard	and	accepted;	you’re	accepting	the	feedback	and	the	help. This	makes	room	for	more	active	and	constructive	thought,	clearing	away	the	negative	air. Being	proactive	instead	of	reactive	means	you’re	being	more	directive.	By	asking	specific questions,	instead	of	general	feedback,	you	can	make	someone	think	before	speaking.	It’s easy	to	say:	“This	idea	sucks”,	it’s	much	harder	to	come	up	with	a	creative	addition	to	a problem.	By	directing	and	guiding	the	ideas,	thoughts	and	solutions,	you	can	bring	out	the best	of	a	conversation. By	 learning	 how	 to	 handle	 feedback,	 I	 could	 make	 my	 business	 thrive.	 I	 made	 many mutually	beneficial	connections	with	people	in	the	industry,	many	of	which	I	still	keep	in touch	with	to	this	day.   I	realized	the	CEO	at	the	dinner	must	have	gotten	tired	of	everyone	knowing	who	he	is, before	 he’d	 even	 met	 them.	 We	 had	 an	 interesting	 conversation	 about	 apps	 and	 he	 was thrilled	to	see	such	a	young	person	talk	about	technology	passionately.	Although	I	can’t know	for	sure,	I’ve	must	have	made	a	better	impression	than	most	of	the	dinner	guests. See?	Networking	isn’t	as	boring	as	it	sounds.	And	it	sure	makes	a	good	story,	and	money in	the	bank!   3.	Making	Mockups  Now	that	you	have	an	app	problem	and	solution,	you	can	continue	with	the	next	step	of the	process:	making	mockups.	It’s	not	hard.	In	fact,	the	hardest	part	of	making	a	mockup	is not	overdoing	it. It’s	easy	to	cram	your	app	full	of	features,	but	all	of	those	features	take	away	the	essence of	what	you	app	does:	solve	a	problem. Start	your	making-mockups	with	a	single	line	of	text:	your	app’s	description.	Examples:  Indie	 Runway	 helps	 startup	 founders	 plan	 their	 financial	 runway,	 and	 tracks	 their growth	goals	for	them. Match	Around	brings	potential	dates	together,	by	matching	their	Facebook	likes	and checking	GPS	proximity. Sporous	 facilitates	 easy	 idea	 sharing	 in	 creative	 sessions	 through	 real-time moodboard	editing.  Then,	 highlight	 the	 verbs	 in	 those	 sentences:	 planning,	 tracking,	 dating,	 matching, facilitating,	editing,	etcetera.	Verbs	tell	the	stuff	we	do,	and	your	app	is	no	different:	these verbs	explain	the	actions	that	the	user	can	take	in	your	app.  Creating	A	Functional	Specification  Example:	social	media	sharing.	It’s	the	ability	of	a	user	to	take	a	piece	of	content	from	the app	and	put	it	on	Facebook	or	any	other	social	media.	You	want	to	build	this	into	your app,	so	you	have	to	mockup	it. Two	factors	are	important	here:	which	content,	and	which	social	media?	Are	there	videos and	photos	in	the	app,	or	is	it	just	text?	And	to	which	networks	do	you	want	to	share? Another	 example:	 login	 functionality.	 You	 want	 your	 users	 to	 connect	 to	 a	 service	 they already	have,	like	OpenID	or	Facebook	Logins.	Users	that	open	the	app	should	log	in	with their	email	address	and	password. You’re	already	using	Facebook	for	sharing,	and	you	could	also	use	Facebook	for	logging in.	It’s	up	to	you	whether	this	is	a	good	idea,	but	logging	in	with	Facebook	is	a	simple	step for	the	user	and	keeps	them	from	remembering	yet	another	password.	In	the	backend,	if needed,	your	client	could	match	Facebook	email	addresses	with	email	addresses	from	their own	database. We	 now	 have	 two	 features:	 Log	 In	 &	 Sharing.	 You’ll	 explain	 what	 these	 do	 in	 your Functional	Specifications	document.	Write	it	out,	like	this: Log	In	Users	can	log	in	with	Facebook.	At	the	start	of	the	app,	the	user	sees	a	screen	with a	button	that	says	“Log	In	with	Facebook”.	When	they	click	it,	it	takes	them	to	Facebook where	 they	 log	 in,	 and	 after	 that	 they	 return	 to	 the	 app.	 Behind	 the	 curtains,	 the	 app receives	 the	 user’s	 email	 address	 and	 sends	 that	 to	 your	 client’s	 backend	 service	 for matching.   Sharing	 On	 each	 individual	 content	 screen	  video,	 photo	 and	 text 	 there	 is	 a	 Sharing button.	 When	 you	 click	 that,	 a	 Facebook-style	 popup	 appears.	 Users	 can	 type	 a	 short message	 and	 click	 the	 “Send”	 button.	 The	 app	 shares	 this	 piece	 of	 content	 on	 their Facebook	page. As	you	can	see,	you	just	described	what	the	app	does.	If	possible,	include	technical	details like	API	versions	or	webservice	endpoints. Do	this	for	all	the	functions	you	want	in	your	app.	See	if	a	feature	is	either	good	as	is,	or unnecessary.	You	now	have	a	document	with	a	list	of	described	functionalities.	These	are the	essentials	that	form	the	core	of	your	app.  Building	The	Mockups  Download	and	fire	up	Balsamiq	Mockups	and	create	the	mockup	from	the	list	of	described functionalities.	 A	 mockup	 is	 like	 a	 rough	 sketch	 of	 an	 interface.	 Just	 drag-and-drop elements	onto	the	screen	until	it	looks	about	right. Now	 you’re	 going	 to	 annotate	 the	 mockup.	 Go	 to	 the	 Markup	 tab	 inside	 Balsamiq	 and click-and-drag	a	Callout	to	the	iPhone.	Position	it	alongside	a	focus	area.	Make	sure	the text	says	“1”. Now	go	to	your	Functional	Specifications	document,	find	the	paragraph	that	describes	the log	 in	 functionality	 and	 place	 a	 “1”	 somewhere.	 It’s	 a	 note	 for	 the	 reader,	 so	 consider making	a	footnote	that	says:	“Look	up	callout	1	in	Mockups.pdf”.	Now	you’ve	connected the	functionality	you	described	with	the	mockup	you	made. Note	 that	 in	 Balsamiq,	 in	 the	 Markup	 tab,	 there’s	 some	 more	 useful	 symbols.	 Use	 the arrow	to	point	out	what	the	order	of	screens	is	and	which	screens	follow	upon	each	other. That’s	the	“flow”	of	the	app. As	you	can	imagine,	you	must	follow	this	little	procedure	for	each	single	screen	in	your app.	To	summarize:  1.	 Consolidate	your	app’s	features	into	one	single	functionality	description. 2.	 Write	a	narrative	for	the	description,	literally	walking	the	reader	through	whatever	it  does.	You	write	this	in	the	Functional	Specification	document.  3.	 Create	 the	 mockup,	 showing	 the	 functionality.	 Add	 buttons,	 screens,	 texts, placeholders	—	anything	that	needs	to	be	on	the	screen,	add	it.	Connect	screens	with arrows.  4.	 Make	a	connection	between	the	mockup	and	the	Functional	Specification	document  by	adding	callouts	with	numbers,	and	references	to	those	callouts.  5.	 Repeat	for	each	feature.  Now,	what	have	we	got?	We	have	a	text	that	describes	the	app,	and	a	mockup	that	points	it all	out.	It’s	the	rough	outline	of	the	app. As	an	exercise,	print	out	the	mockup	and	cut	out	all	of	the	individual	screens. Start	with	the	first	screen,	put	it	on	a	table	and	“click”	on	the	imaginary	functioning	Log In	 with	 Facebook	 button.	 What	 happens	 now?	 Find	 the	 screen	 that	 follows	 the	 startup   screen	 perhaps	the	content	screen? 	and	put	that	on	the	table. Now	click	on	another	button,	or	have	some	interaction	with	it.	“Play	out”	the	app	like	this, to	get	a	feel	for	how	it’s	working.	You	can	do	this	with	your	client	as	well,	and	you	might even	find	out	interaction	mistakes,	because	you’ve	just	tested	your	app.  Resources  Balsamiq	 Mockups	 The	 no.	 1	 mockup	 tool:	 Balsamiq.

Design	And	Build  Now	 that	 you	 have	 your	 functional	 specification,	 you	 think	 you	 can	 start	 working	 on developing	the	app.	Don’t	do	that!	It’s	a	common	pitfall	for	beginner	App	Makers. Look	in	the	App	Store.	Most	top	selling	apps	aren’t	only	well	thought	out.	They	also	have a	great	graphical	design.	Your	app	is	going	to	be	just	like	that. Development	 is	 a	 large	 part	 of	 app	 making;	 it’s	 that	 what	 makes	 the	 app	 work.	 Design makes	 it	 look	 good,	 look	 sexy,	 and	 will	 make	 sure	 whatever	 you	 and	 your	 client envisioned	is	going	to	happen.  Working	With	A	Designer  You	can	do	the	graphic	design	yourself,	or	hire	a	professional	freelance	designer.	While you	do	that,	keep	in	mind	the	following	tips	and	tricks. If	you’re	designing	for	iOS,	you	could	make	an	app	for	both	iPhone	and	iPad.	Please	do make	two	designs,	not	one	that	you’ll	blow	up	or	reduce	to	fit	the	screen	sizes.	Look	up the	screen	resolutions	of	the	devices	you’re	making	the	app	for,	and	create	an	entire	fresh document	for	each	of	those	devices.	At	the	end	of	this	chapter,	there	are	several	resources that	will	greatly	help	you. You’ll	quickly	find	that	there’s	no	one	resolution	for	iPhone	or	iPad.	Just	use	the	highest resolution,	which	is	the	iPhone	6+.	Then	downsize	the	pixels,	or	rework	the	UI	elements horizontally	and	vertically,	like	a	responsive	website. If	 you’re	 making	 two	 Photoshop	 documents	 for	 both	 iPhone	 and	 iPad,	 copy	 just	 the interaction.	Scale	all	the	parts	of	the	interface	proportionally	and	move	areas	that	won’t	fit to	another	part	of	the	screen. Take	 for	 instance	 an	 interface	 for	 iPad	 that’s	 divided	 in	 1 3	 and	 2 3	 horizontally	 for	 an iPad	in	Landscape	mode.	The	left	1 3	part	is	a	vertical	list,	the	2 3	part	is	a	textual	content area. That	won’t	work	on	iPhone,	because	the	screen	is	way	too	small.	Interaction	with	both	the areas	is	deprioritized,	because	the	size	of	the	screen	is	more	important	than	fitting	both areas	on	the	screen	at	the	same	time.	The	solution	here	is	simple:	fit	them	both	on	top	of each	other,	where	you’ll	interact	with	the	list	first	and	then	move	to	the	textual	content area.	It’s	a	navigation	principle	that	you	first	see	the	list,	tap	on	an	item,	and	then	see	a detailed	view	of	that	item. You,	and	your	designer	have	to	be	very	clear	about	the	inner	workings	and	interactions	of the	app.	It’s	important	that	your	designer	understands	how	it	works. Try	not	to	work	with	a	designer	that’s	worked	in	copy	and	layouts	before.	Basically	that means	you	need	to	work	with	someone	that	has	worked	with	computer	screens	before.	A webdesigner	 is	 perfect,	 but	 a	 brochure	 maker	 isn’t	 a	 good	 fit.	 Also	 make	 sure	 that	 the design	is	made	in	pixel-based	Photoshop	or	Sketch,	not	vector-based	Illustrator.	A	vector file	is	fine	of	course,	as	long	as	it	has	a	static	scale	factor	and	can	be	rasterized.   Let	the	designer	get	to	work.	If	you’ve	managed	well,	he	or	she	has	now	taken	ownership of	the	design	product.	Ask	for	periodical	updates,	or	see	if	you	can	work	together	in	the same	room	for	a	few	days. Remember	that	you’re	not	a	designer	and	that	you	hired	someone	to	do	that	for	you,	so don’t	put	your	nose	in	their	business	all	the	time.	A	good	designer	comes	with	additional ideas	about	the	app,	from	a	graphical	perspective. Some	designers	know	about	interaction	and	experience	design	and	might	even	pinpoint	a few	optimizations	in	the	flow	of	the	app.  Mockup	2.0  The	design	of	the	app	made	by	your	designer	is	going	to	be	the	definitive	graphical	look	of the	app.	Let’s	be	clear	here:	whatever	the	Photoshop	files	look	like,	this	is	what	the	app	is going	to	look	like! There	is	however	a	very	cool	cross-over	between	the	design	and	making	mockups.	Give Google	a	spin	with	searching	for	“teehan	lax	gui	psd”	and	look	at	the	PSD	files	that	come up. These	 guys	 have	 taken	 iOS	 interfaces	 apart	 and	 released	 that	 work	 as	 a	 pre-fabricated Photoshop	grid	of	commonly	used	interface	elements.	Compare	that	to	the	list	of	elements inside	 Balsamiq’s	 Mockup	 program,	 and	 you’ll	 quickly	 see	 that	 it’s	 about	 the	 same elements,	but	then	graphically	rendered	as	if	they	come	directly	from	iOS. You	can	make	a	mockup	out	of	Teehan+Lax’s	GUI	PSD,	but	then	it’ll	look	almost	exactly like	the	actual	app.	You	could	skip	the	entire	process	with	your	graphic	designer	and	do the	design	yourself!  Building	The	App  Now	that	the	design	is	in	order,	it’s	time	to	start	the	development	part	of	the	process.	It’s getting	technical	now,	because	this	is	the	chapter	with	the	programming	and	coding. Rest	assured,	this	part	of	the	framework	is	similar	to	designing	the	app,	but	then	focussed on	programming.	So	what’s	the	difference	then? You’re	going	to	do	the	programming	yourself.	The	best	way	to	become	an	App	Maker	is to	 do	 the	 heavy	 lifting	 yourself.	 Not	 because	 it’s	 the	 largest	 part	 of	 the	 process	 and therefore	cheaper	if	you	do	it	yourself,	and	not	just	because	programming	is	a	sought-after and	marketable	skill. The	reason	you’re	going	to	do	the	programming	yourself,	is	because	if	you	can	program an	 app,	 you	 understand	 the	 inner	 workings	 of	 an	 app.	 You	 know	 what’s	 possible	 and what’s	not,	and	you	know	what	tools	and	solutions	are	available	to	any	problem	you	might want	to	solve	in	the	future. Some	of	the	most	succesful	entrepreneurs	and	visionaries	are	coders.	Think	of	it	like	this: there’s	 nothing	 more	 marketable	 than	 talking	 about	 a	 problem	 of	 a	 prospect	 customer, devising	a	solution	on	the	spot	and	then	selling	that	solution	to	your	customer.	You	know   how	it	works,	you	know	it	will	work	and	you	know	how	much	time	 and	money 	is	going to	be	involved. Programming	and	its	systematic,	process-driven	and	problem-solution	way	of	thinking	is	a great	asset	for	an	App	Maker.	Once	you’ve	gained	critical	mass	in	app	development,	you can	 switch	 back	 to	 an	 overview	 approach	 of	 course.	 Never	 stop	 learning	 and	 thinking though. An	app	is	just	a	piece	of	computer	software	running	on	a	smartphone.	It’s	written	by	a programmer,	and	put	together	with	graphic	assets	created	by	a	designer.	Apps	for	iPhone are	 made	 with	 a	 Mac	 application	 called	 Xcode,	 and	 programmed	 in	 either	 Swift	 or Objective-C.	Many	apps	are	connected	to	the	internet,	which	means	that	they	have	a	back- end	that	allows	storage	of	data	in	the	cloud	or	functionality	that	interconnects	users. Xcode	is	the	only	application	you	can	use	for	making	native	iPhone	apps,	and	it’s	only available	 for	 Mac	 OS	 X.	 It	 includes	 Interface	 Builder,	 a	 tool	 to	 visually	 create	 the graphical	foundation	of	your	app.	It’s	a	scaffolding	tool:	you	can’t	make	a	functional	app with	it,	but	you	can	lay	down	the	groundwork	for	the	GUIs	of	your	app.	Xcode	has	many useful	features,	such	as	Auto	Layout	for	making	your	interface	work	on	multiple	screen resolutions	and	an	iPhone	Simulator	for	testing	your	app	without	an	actual	iPhone. In	order	to	publish	apps	in	the	App	Store	you	need	a	developer	account	from	Apple.	It’s available	 for	 $	 99	 USD	 a	 year,	 and	 needs	 to	 be	 renewed	 each	 year.	 Apple	 has	 a comprehensive	 online	 toolset	 available	 for	 managing	 new	 and	 published	 apps,	 called iTunes	 Connect,	 as	 well	 as	 an	 extensive	 set	 of	 documentation.	 Additionally,	 iTunes Connect	now	features	a	beta	distribution	tool	called	TestFlight.	It	can	be	used	to	distribute your	app	to	beta	testers.  What	Do	You	Need	To	Build	An	App?  In	order	to	make	an	app	for	iPhone	or	iPad,	you	will	need	at	least	the	following	things:  A	Mac	with	OS	X.	If	you	don’t	have	one,	find	a	second-hand	MacBook	or	Mac	Mini to	work	on.	Those	are	the	cheapest,	but	don’t	get	one	from	before	2012. Xcode.	It’s	the	free	software	program	made	by	Apple,	and	can	be	downloaded	from the	Mac	App	Store.	It	comes	with	an	iPhone	and	iPad	Simulator	to	try	out	your	apps.  If	you	get	more	serious	about	App	Making,	you’ll	also	need	the	following:  Actual	devices.	Start	with	an	iPhone	4	or	iPhone	4S,	but	you	might	want	an	iPhone	6 or	future	devices	too.	Get	an	iPad	if	you’re	designing	specifically	for	that	platform. The	key	point	here	is	that	you	can	try	your	app	on	the	Simulator,	but	there’s	nothing quite	like	testing	an	app	on	a	physical	device.	Also	note	that	the	Simulator	doesn’t emulate	iPhone	processing	speeds,	and	cannot	take	in	account	reception	errors	while using	an	app	on	the	streets	for	example. A	paid	account	at	the	iOS	Developer	Portal.	That’s	a	yearly	subscription	of	under	$ 99	USD	and	it’ll	allow	you	to	publish	your	app	on	the	iOS	App	Store.	It’s	needed	if you	want	people	to	download	your	app	from	the	store.	The	process	for	signing	up	can be	difficult	and	takes	around	one	month	to	complete.   If	you’re	code	illiterate	and	want	to	keep	it	that	way,	go	to	Elance	or	ODesk	 also	known as	 Upwork 	 and	 get	 yourself	 a	 freelancer.	 There’s	 a	 lot	 of	 options,	 so	 be	 careful	 with picking	a	freelancer	for	your	first	project. Remember	 that	 you’ll	 need	 to	 code	 an	 app	 to	 understand	 how	 it	 works,	 and	 that	 your inability	to	do	so	will	put	you	behind	those	who	know	their	coding.	When	looking	for	a freelancer,	take	into	account	what	you	learned	during	the	Design	step. Some	 developers	 are	 more	 accustomed	 to	 the	 Western	 way	 of	 working,	 compared	 to people	from	other	countries.	Also	look	for	reviews	and	pick	someone	with	a	proven	track record. Modern	 process	 management	 often	 work	 with	 iterations	 on	 a	 micro	 and	 macro	 level. When	you’re	making	a	new	feature,	you	always	design	it	first,	then	code	it,	then	test	it, and	then	push	it	live.	Whether	it’s	a	small	component	or	an	entire	new	part	of	the	app, follow	this	process.  Swift	and	Objective-C  iPhone	 apps	 are	 all	 written	 in	 Swift	 or	 Objective-C.	 Swift	 is	 the	 new	 programming language	 invented	 by	 Apple	 and	 it	 was	 announced	 on	 June	 2,	 2014,	 and	 subsequently released	as	a	stable	1.0	version	on	September	9,	2014.	It’s	a	fairly	new	language	and	apps entirely	 written	 in	 Swift	 are	 just	 now	 hitting	 the	 App	 Store.	 Swift	 is	 gaining	 rapidly	 in popularity	 and	 its	 features	 are	 highly	 acclaimed	 by	 both	 beginner	 and	 advanced programmers. The	great	thing	about	Swift	is	that	it’s	interchangeable	with	Objective-C.	This	helps	the adoption	 of	 Swift	 by	 programmers,	 because	 they	 don’t	 have	 to	 rewrite	 their	 entire codebase	to	be	compatible	with	the	new	language.	Swift’s	popularity	rose	from	place	68  June	 2014 	 to	 place	 22	  January	 2015 	 according	 to	 the	 Redmonk	 Programming Language	 Rankings.	 The	 rank	 is	 measured	 by	 StackOverflow	 and	 GitHub	 activity,	 a popular	programming	Q&A	site	and	a	code	repository	service	respectively. Which	is	better,	Swift	or	Objective-C?	For	beginners,	Swift	is	clearly	the	best	option.	It’s easier	 compared	 to	 Objective-C	 and	 removes	 overhead	 from	 the	 development	 process, making	 the	 barrier-to-entry	 for	 beginners	 considerably	 lower.	 Objective-C	 is	 still	 the standard	 in	 many	 firms	 around	 the	 globe,	 so	 legacy	 code	 will	 be	 Objective-C	 for	 the coming	years.	As	an	employed	iOS	developer,	you’ll	see	more	Objective-C	than	Swift.  Middleware:	Build	Once	And	Run	On	Multiple	Platforms  Middleware	 or	cross-platform 	like	Cordova	or	PhoneGap,	 is	 a	 popular	 choice	 for	 app developers,	because	it	enables	them	to	write	code	once	and	deploy	it	to	both	Android	and iOS.	Apps	for	Android	are	written	in	Java	and	they’re	not	compatible	with	iOS	apps.	If you	 want	 to	 make	 an	 app	 for	 both	 platforms,	 but	 don’t	 want	 to	 program	 the	 same	 app twice,	middleware	is	a	time-saving	option. Many	of	these	cross-platform	tools	are	based	on	web	technology,	such	as	HTML5,	CSS and	 JavaScript.	 PhoneGap	 is	 the	 most	 widely	 adopted;	 it’s	 being	 used	 by	 400.000	 app   developers.	PhoneGap	has	it’s	own	build	tools	and	technically	it	exports	an	app	that	can	be ran	 and	 built	 inside	 Xcode,	 making	 it	 a	 hybrid	 app:	 native	 components	 combined	 with HTML5.	 PhoneGap	 now	 features	 PhoneGap	Build,	 which	 replaces	 the	 Xcode	 compiler with	a	cloud-based	solution.	PhoneGap	is	free	and	released	under	the	open-source	Apache Public	License	v2. Alternatives	 to	 PhoneGap	 are	 Cordova	  open-source ,	 Sencha	 Touch	  open-source	 and commercial ,	 and	 RhoMobile	 Suite	  open-source .	 PhoneGap	 outperforms	 these alternatives	 by	 supported	 devices	  iOS,	 Android,	 Windows	 Phone,	 BlackBerry	 OS, Ubuntu	and	Firefox	OS 	and	supported	hardware	 accelerometer,	camera,	etc. . Using	middleware	such	as	PhoneGap	has	two	major	downsides.	Since	such	tools	are	all based	 on	 web	 technology,	 they’re	 unable	 to	 make	 use	 of	 hardware-accelerated	 native components.	Animations,	transitions	and	high-resolution	graphics	don’t	work	as	well	as	in a	native	app,	which	makes	it	impossible	to	use	for	games	or	visually	intense	apps.	Also, using	middleware	requires	good	knowledge	of	compilers	and	build	tools,	which	makes	it an	inconvenient	option	for	beginner	developers.  Back-End:	How	To	Internet-Enable	Your	App?  Is	 your	 app	 connected	 to	 the	 internet?	 Creating	 a	 custom	 back-end	 with	 server-side languages	like	NodeJS,	Ruby	or	PHP	can	take	lots	of	time,	money	and	effort.	It’s	easier	to use	a	Platform-as-a-Service	tool,	such	as	Parse. Parse	is	a	cloud-based	solution	for	storing	data	offline	and	online	in	your	app.	Say	you’re making	a	social	app	with	a	stream	of	pictures	and	status	updates.	You	could	use	Parse	to store	that	data	in	the	cloud	and	use	their	SDK	to	get	it	from	and	to	your	users.	Using	a	tool such	 as	 Parse	 completely	 removes	 the	 need	 to	 build	 a	 custom	 back-end.	 Parse’s	 basic usage	tier	is	free,	while	subsequent	tiers	start	at	$	100	USD	a	month. Alternatives	 to	 Parse	 are	 Appcelerator	  middleware	 +	 PaaS,	 commercial 	 and	 App42  PaaS	+	analytics,	free	tier .  Learning:	How	Much	Time	And	Effort	Is	Involved?  How	much	time	is	it	going	to	cost	to	learn	all	of	this?	App	development	involves	a	lot	of components,	and	when	you’re	new	it	can	be	quite	a	challenge	to	get	acquainted	with	all the	tools. Fear	 not!	 You	 can	 make	 your	 first	 app	 in	 a	 day	 at	 max,	 with	 no	 prior	 programming experience.	 The	 only	 thing	 you	 need	 is	 a	 good	 resource	 that	 shows	 you	 the	 ropes	 and focuses	on	one	toolset	at	once.	There’s	plenty	of	beginner	tutorials	on	the	internet,	as	well as	premium	courses.  10	Frequently	Asked	Questions	About	Creating	Your	First	App  How	much	does	an	app	cost?	The	cost	of	developing	an	app	can	really	differ	from	one contracting	company	to	the	other.	Outsourced	freelancers,	as	found	on	Upwork	 formerly Odesk Elance ,	 can	 create	 a	 simple	 app	 for	 $	 3.000	 USD	 to	 $	 10.000	 USD.	 Bigger   companies	 can	 ask	 from	 $	 25.000	 USD	 to	 $	 100.000	 USD	 for	 a	 complex	 application, including	 graphic	 design	 and	 back-end	 programming.	 Companies	 like	 Tinder,	 Pinterest, Facebook,	etc.	can	spend	hundreds	of	thousands	to	millions	on	developing	and	marketing one	app.	It’s	just	like	anything	else:	you	get	what	you	pay	for. I’m	stuck	with	a	programming	bug.	How	do	I	get	help?	A	lot	of	beginner	programming questions	 have	 been	 asked	 already	 on	 sites	 such	 as	 StackOverflow.com.	 Search	 for	 the error	message	or	bug	you	found,	and	you’ll	most	likely	find	a	solution.	When	asking	a question	 yourself,	 always	 search	 first,	 and	 make	 sure	 you	 explain	 your	 problem thoroughly	 and	 describe	 the	 steps	 you’ve	 already	 taken	 to	 solve	 it.	 Quora	 is	 a	 good medium	for	asking	non-technical	questions,	such	as	about	business	and	UX UI	topics. I	have	a	brilliant	idea	for	an	app.	Where	do	I	start?	If	you’re	serious	about	creating	a business	based	on	an	app,	don’t	start	with	programming	immediately.	First,	validate	your business	idea	by	pitching	to	your	target	audience.	Get	in	touch	with	potential	customers and	survey	them,	asking	for	feedback.	Keep	in	mind	that	most	successful	apps	solve	an immediate	 problem,	 in	 such	 a	 way	 that	 customers	 want	 to	 pay	 for	 it.	 When	 you’ve validated	 your	 idea,	 and	 created	 a	 relationship	 with	 your	 first	 customers,	 proceed	 with design	and	development	of	the	actual	app. Do	I	need	an	iPhone	to	create	apps?	No,	but	it’s	recommended.	Xcode	has	an	iPhone Simulator	that	runs	your	apps	just	like	a	physical	iPhone	would.	Holding	a	real	iPhone with	 your	 app	 in	 your	 hands	 is	 different	 from	 seeing	 it	 on	 your	 computers	 monitor,	 so testing	your	app	on	an	actual	device	is	recommended.	Keep	in	mind	that	Xcode	only	runs on	Mac	OS	X. I’m	not	good	at	math.	Do	I	need	it	for	programming?	Yes	and	no.	It’s	an	urban	myth that	to	be	able	to	code	you	must	be	good	at	math.	A	lot	of	programming	principles	find their	roots	in	mathematics,	but	they’re	not	required	for	a	basic	understanding	of	how	to make	apps.	When	you	dive	deeper	and	become	more	proficient	at	programming,	you’ll find	that	you	have	picked	up	some	math	skills	along	the	way. I	work	for	a	company.	Do	I	pursue	my	app	idea	with	the	company,	or	in	my	own time?	 It	 depends	 on	 the	 company	 and	 your	 position.	 Are	 you	 an	 engineer	 and	 is	 your company’s	core	business	online,	digital	or	closely	related	to	apps?	Then	you	might	want	to build	 a	 prototype	 and	 convince	 your	 supervisor	 or	 employer	 to	 pursue	 the	 idea.	 If	 you think	your	employer	won’t	see	the	value,	you	can	pursue	the	app	idea	in	your	own	time. Be	mindful	of	your	contract	with	your	employer.	Inventions	made	during	your	time	with the	 company	 could	 be	 regarded	 as	 the	 company’s	 intellectual	 property,	 and	 not	 yours. Also,	 confidential	 information	 that	 leads	 you	 to	 your	 invention	 can	 be	 protected	 and claimed	by	your	employer. My	app	idea	already	exists	in	the	App	Store.	What	do	I	do	now?	The	fact	that	it	exists doesn’t	mean	it’s	a	good	app.	You	can	always	create	a	competing	app	and	make	it	better than	what’s	already	out	there.	Likewise,	the	fact	that	an	app	doesn’t	exist	yet	doesn’t	make it	a	good	idea	to	create	it.	It	could	well	be	that	an	app	has	been	published	multiple	times, but	was	pulled	from	the	App	Store	because	there	was	no	need	for	it.	Always	validate	your app	idea	by	the	problem	it	is	solving	and	the	value	it	has	for	its	users. Why	is	the	iPhone	sometimes	called	iOS?	There’s	a	slight	difference:	iPhone	is	the	name   for	the	actual	hardware	smartphone	and	iOS	stands	for	“i	Operating	System”.	Going	back into	Apple’s	history,	the	iMac	computer	was	the	first	product	to	have	the	prefix	“i”.	Later on,	they	followed	this	style	and	created	more	products:	iTunes,	iPod,	iPad	and	iPhone.	It’s only	natural	to	call	the	operating	system	that	runs	on	the	iPhone,	iOS. How	do	you	effectively	market	an	iPhone	app?	Entire	books	have	been	written	about this	question!	It’s	a	hard	one,	but	not	impossible	to	answer.	All	successful	apps	solve	one problem	 in	 such	 a	 way	 that	 people	 want	 to	 pay	 for	 it.	 You	 can	 either	 come	 up	 with	 a problem	and	find	people	that	need	your	solution,	or	find	an	audience	and	survey	them	for problems	you	could	make	a	solution	for.	Keep	in	touch	with	this	customer	group	and	give them	a	way	to	tell	others	about	your	product.	Referrals	and	word-of-mouth	is	an	effective and	cheap	marketing	machine. What’s	the	worst	way	to	learn	programming?	Giving	up	is	one	of	the	worst	ways	to learn	programming.	Learning	a	new	skill	has	ups	and	downs,	and	you	can	only	keep	going by	celebrating	the	ups	and	seeing	through	the	downs.	Giving	up	is	not	part	of	the	equation. Also,	 find	 out	 what	 your	 learning	 style	 is.	 There’s	 no	 point	 in	 watching	 videos,	 when writing	code	and	trial-and-error	suits	you	better.	Finally,	don’t	randomly	pick	a	book	on programming	from	the	library,	but	find	a	proven	learning	method	or	path.	When	learning Spanish,	you	don’t	start	with	reading	a	dictionary,	right?  Publishing:	Going	From	Beta	To	Live  Before	an	app	gets	published	in	the	App	Store,	you	need	to	upload	it	with	iTunes	Connect. You	 enter	 your	 app’s	 basic	 information	 like	 a	 description,	 app	 categories	 and	 what	 app icon	 to	 use.	 Your	 app	 then	 enters	 the	 review	 process,	 a	 requirement	 from	 Apple.	 A reviewer	from	Apple	checks	if	your	app	adheres	to	the	Review	Guidelines	and	whether	it has	bugs.	It’s	a	quality	check	to	ensure	only	good	apps	enter	the	App	Store,	and	from	the point	of	uploading	it	takes	about	2	weeks	to	get	your	app	reviewed. Wouldn’t	it	be	great	to	have	your	own	app	in	the	App	Store?	You	now	have	a	basic	outline of	the	tools	involved	in	making	apps,	and	what	it	takes	to	learn	how	to	make	your	own apps.	Get	started	with	Swift	by	reading	a	book	or	following	a	tutorial,	craft	a	great	looking interface	with	Balsamiq,	get	yourself	a	developer	account	and	publish	that	app!  Testing	&	Debugging  One	of	the	key	points	of	agile	development,	one	of	the	popular	development	management methods	out	there,	is	that	you	constantly	iterate	over	producing	and	testing. It	basically	means	that	you	test	what	you	make. Testing	and	debugging	can	be	extremely	boring,	but	unlike	watching	glue	dry,	it’s	very rewarding.	You’ll	produce	a	solid	product	because	you	checked	whether	or	not	it	worked. If	 you’re	 the	 programmer	 of	 the	 app,	 there’s	 a	 very	 common	 pitfall:	 after	 a	 while,	 you cannot	 see	 the	 forest	 for	 the	 trees.	 You’re	 so	 deep	 in	 the	 code	 that	 you	 won’t	 see superficial	 interaction	 errors	 any	 more.	 If	 you’re	 a	 good	 programmer,	 you	 make abstractions.	That	means	you	use	the	same	piece	of	code	twice	or	three	times,	because	it   can	serve	multiple	purposes	by	changing	it	a	little	bit.	That	“changing	it	a	little	bit”	usually makes	your	code	break	in	a	place	you	didn’t	see	coming.	This	is	why	you	test	your	code, and	test	the	entire	app. Luckily,	we	have	a	process	for	that.	For	every	piece	of	functionality	you	create,	you	are going	to	write	a	tiny	testing	procedure.	Not	with	code,	but	just	on	paper.	Take	for	instance the	Log	In	functionality	we	designed	earlier.	The	testing	procedure	for	that	is	as	follows:  1.	 Open	the	App. 2.	 Click	the	Log	In	button. 3.	 See	that	the	app	switches	to	Facebook. 4.	 Log	In	with	Facebook,	see	that	the	app	switches	back. 5.	 Wait	 a	 little	 bit,	 then	 check	 the	 debugging	 output	 in	 Xcode	 for	 a	 line	 that	 says  “Logged	in	via	Facebook”.  See,	 just	 five	 small	 steps.	 However,	 when	 two	 weeks	 into	 the	 development	 process something	 in	 the	 Log	 In	 process	 breaks,	 you’re	 going	 to	 be	 thankful	 that	 you	 have	 a procedure	that	notes	how	the	functionality	should	work. When	you	have	a	bunch	of	these,	you	can	pick	a	day	of	the	week	and	quickly	test	all	the procedures	 one	 after	 another.	 You’ll	 notice	 it	 when	 something	 breaks,	 because	 it	 won’t work	 like	 it	 is	 described	 in	 the	 procedure.	 You	 can	 even	 get	 somebody	 else	 to	 do	 the testing	for	you,	provided	that	they	write	down	their	findings.	And	even	better,	but	on	a different	 subject,	 there’s	 testing	 software	 available	 that	 automates	 the	 procedure	 by simulating	 taps	 and	 touches	 on	 a	 simulator	 iPhone.	 If	 you’re	 into	 that,	 look	 into	 a	 tool called	“AppThwack”.  Resources  Xcode	And	Interface	Builder	 With	 Xcode	 and	 Interface	 Builder	 you	 code	 iPhone	 and iPad	apps,	period.	It’s	the	best	programming	environment	around	the	block,	and	supports both	Swift	and	Objective-C	programming.

The	following	letter	is	one	I	wrote	in	France	during	the	summer	of	2015,	from	a	tent	in	the middle	 of	 nowhere.	 I	 sent	 the	 letter	 to	 subscribers	 of	 LearnAppMaking.com,	 and	 I’m showing	it	to	you	because	it’s	an	important	story.	The	letter	is	unedited	from	its	original. Hello	YOU! When	I’m	writing	this,	I’m	sitting	with	my	laptop	in	a	tent.	Yes,	one	of	those	tiny	camping tents. Around	me	is	nothing	more	than	grass,	a	ton	of	bugs,	birds,	trees,	fields	with	sunflowers, vines	and	wineries,	country	roads	flowing	through	countless	villages.	And	there’s	sun,	lots of	it,	making	for	a	comfy	25	C	 	77	F	in	the	shade. I’m	in	Northern	France.	Last	week	we	rented	a	car,	threw	a	tent	and	some	sleeping	bags	in the	 back,	 and	 drove	 south.	 Hopping	 from	 city	 to	 city	 we’re	 making	 our	 way	 to	 Paris, visiting	friends	we	have	there. There’s	 no	 WiFi,	 no	 App	 Store,	 no	 conversion	 funnels,	 no	 business	 validation,	 no customer	support,	none	of	it.	No	clients	calling,	no	masterminds,	no	forum	posts,	no	Q&A  although	I	love	Q&As ,	none	of	it. Instead,	 there’s	 sun,	 wine,	 room	 for	 thought,	 time	 for	 reading,	 and	 seeing	 some	 of	 the world. I	know	a	parable	that’s	fitting	for	this	situation.	It	starts	with	a	monk	and	his	apprentice. The	monk	asks	if	the	apprentice	wants	tea,	and	starts	to	fill	is	cup… But	wait…	It’s	time	for	nothing!	I	might	tell	you	the	entire	story	next	week.	Why	don’t you	 take	 the	 time	 you	 have	 now,	 to	 get	 outside?	 Walk	 around	 the	 block,	 get	 a	 coffee somewhere.	I	assume	there’s	summer	where	you	are,	but	if	you	happen	to	find	yourself	on Antarctica:	get	outside	for	a	snow	ball	fight! Seriously.	If	you’re	like	me,	you’re	spending	80%	of	your	day	in	front	of	a	computer.	Get outside,	get	some	air,	catch	the	sun	and	do	nothing. Get	free	from	the	day-to-day	every	once	in	a	while.	Your	work	will	still	be	there	when	you get	back,	but	for	you,	in	the	meantime,	anything	can	happen. Only	an	empty	cup	allows	itself	to	get	filled	with	tea. Have	a	great	week! Reinder   5.	Getting	Feedback	And	Iterating  Using	The	Zappos	Model  Do	you	know	Zappos,	the	online	retailer?	It’s	led	by	CEO	Tony	Hsieh,	who’s	famous	for his	“Zappos	Model”	on	customer	service.	We’re	going	to	apply	that	same	model	to	apps, and	tweak	it	so	it	can	be	used	by	one	single	app	developer	instead	of	a	whole	team. Some	facts:  New	Zappos	employees	get	$	100	to	buy	2	pairs	of	shoes	from	Zappos,	of	which	they have	to	return	one	through	Zappos’	website.	It	gives	them	first-hand	experience	of	a Zappos	 customer,	 and	 allows	 them	 to	 see	 the	 company	 culture	 through	 their	 sales channels. All	new	employees	start	out	as	service	representatives	at	a	Zappos	call	center,	and often	return	to	it	on	a	regular	basis. Customers	can	return	your	shoes	up	to	one	year	after	purchase.	Their	call	center	is available	24 7.  Zappos	customers	are	among	the	most	loyal,	as	the	Zappos	brand	is	entirely	built	around good	customer	service.  Zappos	Model:	It’s	All	About	Availability  If	you	had	to	pick	one	metric	that	makes	the	Zappos	Model	successful,	based	on	the	above characteristics,	what	would	you	say? Availability! The	availability	of	a	support	center,	a	sales	representative	you	can	personally	speak	to,	is the	 single	 most	 important	 factor	 in	 the	 Zappos	 Model.	 Second	 to	 availability	 is authenticity	of	the	brand,	company	culture	and	of	course	pricing	and	return	policies. As	an	indie	developer,	you	don’t	have	the	capacity	to	hire	a	24 7	call	center	support	team. It’s	too	expensive,	and	most	likely	overkill	anyway.	But	how	can	you	apply	the	Zappos Model	to	your	own	customer	service?  Customer	Service:	Contextual	And	Frictionless  You	 do	 have	 customer	 service,	 right?	 In	 case	 you	 don’t,	 here	 are	 some	 examples	 of customers	needing	support:  The	game	app	you	published	crashed,	because	of	a	bug. The	user	can’t	log	in	into	the	app,	or	forgot	his	or	her	password. The	user	bought	an	In-App	Purchase	upgrade,	but	it’s	failed. One	of	your	app’s	user	interfaces	isn’t	clear,	and	the	user	needs	help	to	figure	it	out.  Currently,	the	only	way	a	user	can	reach	you	is	through	the	email	address	listed	on	your   App	 Store	 page	 or	 by	 leaving	 an	 App	 Store	 review.	 Which	 one	 do	 you	 think	 the	 user chooses?	The	App	Store	review,	of	course,	because	it	is	the	channel	with	the	least	amount of	friction	and	effort.	On	top	of	that,	users	that	had	a	negative	experience	with	your	app are	more	likely	to	write	a	review. It’s	really	easy	to	leave	a	review	to	complain:	bugs,	unclear	UI,	the	inability	to	purchase	or restore	IAPs,	etcetera.	Unfortunately	for	the	app	publisher,	the	review	is	public	and	greatly influences	your	App	Store	ranking. Is	it	possible	to	avoid	these	app	users	leaving	a	negative	review?	The	only	way	to	do	so	is to	introduce	a	frictionless	solution	for	contacting	support	in	the	most	contextual	way. In	other	words:	apply	a	bandage	when	it	still	hurts.  When	 a	 user	 starts	 your	 app,	 he	 or	 she	 will	 see	 a	 message	 or	 note	 that	 Customer Support	is	available. In	the	app	menu,	include	an	option:	“Support”	or	“Feedback”. When	a	user	taps	that	menu	option,	they’re	taken	to	an	in-app	message	center.	They can	directly	contact	you	or	your	support	team	and	talk	about	their	issues.  Now,	that	kind-of	solves	the	availability	and	context	problem.	You	can	even	track	whether the	app	has	crashed	previously,	and	then	show	an	active	dialog	asking	if	the	user	wants	to contact	Support	about	the	crash.  Cloning	You:	Be	Available	24 7  Unfortunately,	you’re	not	available	24 7!	As	a	sole	indie	developer,	you	need	your	sleep. How	can	you	still	offer	good	service?  When	a	user	contacts	you	outside	of	“office	hours”,	you	can	show	a	message	that	the feedback	is	noted.	Then,	instead	of	leaving	the	user	out	in	the	cold	you	can	offer	them a	 free	 coupon	 or	 a	 discount	 on	 their	 next	 purchase.	 Inform	 the	 user	 of	 your	 turn- around	time,	so	they	know	they’re	being	heard. Use	intelligent	matching	on	the	chat	message	to	connect	it	to	a	FAQ	item.	When	a user	inputs	“I	forgot	my	password”,	you	can	match	that	to	the	Forgot	Password	FAQ item	and	send	a	link	to	the	article	to	the	user. When	you’re	getting	too	many	customer	service	queries,	it’s	probably	time	to	scale up.	 When	 your	 cashflow	 doesn’t	 allow	 that,	 reconsider	 your	 business	 model. Remember:	eliminate	before	you	automate.  Automation:	Scaling	Up  Technically,	you’re	automating	your	support.	That’s	what	Zappos	did,	too.	They’re	using excellent	 technical	 IT	 systems	 to	 support	 their	 customer	 support	 staff	 with	 the	 task	 at hand.	 Automation	 is	 all	 about	 elimination:	 which	 steps	 can	 you	 remove	 to	 make	 the process	as	smooth	as	possible? Instead	 of	 offering	 telephone	 support,	 you’re	 using	 in-app	 chat.	 You	 can	 intelligently   match	the	text	and	suggest	FAQ	articles	to	the	user	when	you’re	not	around.	Also,	you	use your	coding	skill	to	contextually	offer	help	on	an	app	crash.	You	could	even	show	a	little tooltip	on	an	app	screen	to	ask	for	help	in	that	particular	screen.  Benefits	Of	Using	Customer	Support  What	are	the	benefits	of	integrating	an	in-app	message	center?  Users	leave	fewer	negative	reviews	and	ratings	for	your	app,	because	you’ve	helped them	before	they	could	do	so.	As	a	result,	your	app	ranking	is	higher. Users	get	in	touch	with	your	company	culture,	because	you’re	speaking	directly	to them. You	get	feedback	you	wouldn’t	get	otherwise.	An	in-app	message	center	has	such	a low	 barrier	 to	 entry,	 that	 users	 with	 positive	 feedback	  generally	 less	 motivated	 to give 	will	find	you	too. Indirectly,	customer	service	is	a	sales	channel	too.	You	can	directly	tap	into	the	need of	a	customer,	and	thanks	to	your	good	service	they’ll	return.

The	App	Maker’s	Leverage   Dating	+	Facebook	+	Festivals  A	long	time	before	Tinder	became	popular	I	built	a	dating	app.	You	could	log	in	with	your Facebook	 and	 the	 app	 would	 match	 you	 with	 a	 potential	 date	 based	 on	 your	 Facebook likes.	It	also	took	in	account	your	GPS	location,	which	essentially	meant	you	could	date people	near	you	with	the	same	interests	as	you. Online	dating	with	apps	wasn’t	so	popular	back	then.	No	tools	for	App	Store	Optimization were	 available,	 so	 all	 marketing	 we	 did	 was	 outside	 of	 the	 App	 Store:	 social	 media marketing	on	Facebook,	influencer	outreach	on	Twitter,	and	even	getting	into	local	media with	press	releases.	It	didn’t	work. Then	we	marketed	the	app	to	festivals	and	it	was	a	major	success.	Often,	business	don’t lack	a	good	product	but	they	lack	customers.	We	figured	that	if	we	went	to	a	place	where people	were	in	a	dating	mood,	and	had	their	smartphones	with	them,	we	could	convince them	on	the	spot	to	try	our	app.	We	teamed	up	with	“The	Love	Police”,	a	festival	side-gig that	entertained	the	crowd	by	letting	them	put	up	“Single	lady	seeks	cute	boyfriend”-style ads	 at	 the	 festival,	 trying	 to	 get	 them	 in	 touch	 with	 a	 potential	 date	  with	 a	 wink,	 of course .	They	started	promoting	our	app,	motivated	people	to	try	it,	and	as	a	result	we	got traction	and	matched	up	quite	some	dates. Go	where	your	customers	are	already	looking!   Getting	Started	With	App	Store	Optimization  You’ve	just	made	your	first	iPhone	app	and	published	it	into	the	App	Store.	Great!	But	the app	installs	aren’t	going	through	the	roof.	Now	what? App	Store	Optimization	 ASO 	are	the	tactics	you	can	use	to	rank	your	app	higher	in	the App	Store.	Ranking	governs	which	apps	are	listed	as	the	Top	25	and	Top	100	in	the	App Store,	both	in	the	Overall	ranking	and	in	individual	categories.	An	app’s	ranking	greatly influences	how	many	people	install	it.	This	article	will	explain	and	teach	you	how	to	use ASO	to	your	benefit	in	a	hands-on	manner.  What	Is	App	Store	Optimization?  App	 Store	 Optimization	 is	 the	 process	 of	 improving	 the	 visibility	 of	 an	 app	 in	 the	 app stores	 iOS	App	Store,	Google	Play,	etc. ,	with	the	goal	of	ranking	higher	in	search	results and	top	rankings.	A	higher	ranking	means	that	more	potential	users	download	and	install the	app.	In	this	sense,	App	Store	Optimization	is	similar	to	Search	Engine	Optimization  SEO 	but	then	for	app	stores. Generally	speaking,	App	Store	Optimization	means	that	you’re	making	an	effort	to	expose your	app	to	a	bigger	number	of	potential	users,	and	increase	your	chances	of	acquiring those	users.	Of	course,	the	quality	of	these	users	matter.	Ultimately	the	conversion	counts, both	from	potential	user	to	acquired	user,	as	from	acquired	user	to	paying	customer.	In	this sense,	app	engagement	and	user	retention	matters,	too. App	Store	Optimization	doesn’t	directly	involve	increasing	engagement	and	retention,	but will	help	you	to	attract	the	right	users	and	this	is	the	determining	factor	for	the	success	of an	app.	When	a	user	steps	through	the	door,	the	user	story	isn’t	over.	Although	App	Store Optimization	 makes	 sure	 more	 users	 install	 your	 app,	 the	 end	 goal	 is	 to	 attract	 paying customers. Throughout	 the	 article	 the	 iOS	 App	 Store	 is	 used	 as	 an	 example	 for	 App	 Store Optimization.	However,	every	ASO	tactic	will	also	apply	to	Google	Play	and	other	app stores.  The	Main	Aspects	Of	App	Store	Optimization  The	determining	aspects	of	App	Store	Optimization	are:  App	title,	and	whether	it	includes	keywords. App	icon,	a	single	representative	graphic	that’s	used	to	identify	the	app	both	in	the App	Store	and	on	a	users	home	screen. App	 screenshots	  and	 video ,	 the	 several	 graphic	 assets	 that	 depict	 the	 app’s functionality	when	browsing	the	App	Store. App	ratings	and	reviews,	the	subjective	voice	of	a	user	that’s	already	using	your	app. App	downloads,	the	number	of	users	that	have	downloaded	your	app. App	description	and	localization,	the	text	that’s	shown	in	the	App	Store	alongside	the app	icon	and	screenshots.   Several	 tools	 can	 track	 these	 factors	 and	 determine	 their	 influence	 on	 an	 apps	 ranking. Popular	tools	are:	AppAnnie	 market	insight	and	analytics ,	Google	Analytics	for	Mobile  analytics	and	tracking ,	and	SensorTower	 insight	and	analytics .	Apple	has	published	its own	 App	 Analytics	 platform	 in	 April	 2015,	 and	 it	 is	 the	 only	 tool	 that	 can	 measure inbound	traffic	and	referrers	for	your	App	Store	app	page.  Optimizing	Your	App’s	Assets  Let’s	 first	 start	 by	 optimizing	 the	 assets	 your	 app	 has:	 its	 title,	 icon,	 screenshots	 and keywords.  App	Title	And	Keywords  What’s	in	a	name?	The	title	of	an	app	is	a	verbal	hook	your	users	identify	your	app	with. It’s	visible	on	your	app’s	website	 outside	the	App	Store ,	inside	the	App	Store	itself	and below	the	app	icon	on	a	user’s	home	screen. Ideating	a	good	app	title	is	an	art	on	its	own.	In	general,	an	app	name	should	address	two things:  Does	it	include	a	brand	or	product	name? Does	it	include	relevant	keywords?  The	name	of	an	app,	together	with	its	icon,	is	often	the	first	trigger	for	a	user	to	check	it out	in	the	App	Store.	When	browsing	the	top	lists,	a	user	only	sees	an	app’s	icon,	title	and category.	When	searching	 i.e.	using	the	search	function 	a	user	sees	the	app	icon,	title,	the name	of	the	publisher	and	two	screenshots. Relevant	keywords	are	words	that	a	user	uses	to	describe	your	product	or	service	in	their own	words.	You	can	ask	yourself:	“When	a	user	searches	for	my	product,	what	kind	of keywords	would	he	or	she	use?”	It’s	often	not	enough	to	come	up	with	a	search	term	you think	is	relevant.	You	need	to	test	what	kind	of	words	your	target	audience	associates	your service	with.	A	good	way	of	researching	that	is	using	a	long-tail	keyword	generator.	These tools	return	search	queries	based	on	keyword	ideas	you	put	in.	Such	search	queries	are used	 by	 real-world	 users,	 which	 makes	 it	 a	 good	 representation	 of	 how	 a	 potential customer	searches	for	your	product. When	 you’ve	 established	 both	 the	 app’s	 brand	 name	 and	 its	 keywords,	 put	 the	 two together.	 Keep	 in	 mind	 that	 Apple	 sometimes	 rejects	 apps	 that	 include	 a	 slogan	 or catchphrase.	You	can	only	include	keywords	in	the	title	when	they’re	relevant	for	the	app, or	explain	the	app	title	in	a	more	complete	way	than	just	the	brand	name. Good	app	titles	are:  Moleskine	Timepage	-	Calendar	for	iCloud,	Google	and	Exchange	 Moleskine	is obviously	 the	 brand	 name,	 but	 “Calendar”	 and	 “iCloud”	 etc.	 are	 relevant	 search keywords . Ultimate	Guitar	Tabs	-	largest	catalog	of	songs	with	guitar	and	ukulele	chords,   tabs,	 lyrics	 and	 guitar	 lessons	  “Ultimate	 Guitar	 Tabs”	 isn’t	 enough,	 because potential	customers	might	search	for	“chords”	or	“ukelele	lessons” . Sleep	Cycle	alarm	clock	 Although	the	product	is	known	as	a	“sleep	cycle	app”,	it’s function	is	that	of	an	“alarm	clock”.   Bad	app	titles	are:  App	Icon  US	PayPal	Fees	 This	is	a	fee	calculator	for	PayPal,	but	it	omits	relevant	keywords: calculator,	share,	etcetera . Iconzoomer	 Unfortunately,	this	app	title	doesn’t	tell	us	one	bit	about	what	it	is.	And no,	it	does	not	zoom	icons . mPage	 This	is	an	app	for	a	popular	online	learning	system,	Moodle.	Unfortunately, the	app	name	only	includes	the	ambiguous	“mPage”	name .  If	the	app	title	is	the	most	important	textual	hook	point	for	a	user,	then	the	app	icon	must be	the	most	important	visual	hook.	The	icon	of	your	app	is	used	everywhere,	both	inside and	outside	the	App	Store.	Just	like	a	logo	represents	a	brand,	your	app	icon	represents your	app. Graphic	 design	 is	 an	 art	 and	 industry	 on	 its	 own,	 but	 within	 the	 realms	 of	 App	 Store Optimization,	take	note	of	the	following	app	icon	heuristics:  Use	one	centered	graphic	element	that	has	no	overlapping	pieces. Keep	it	simple:	don’t	use	complex,	photo-like	graphics,	and	keep	to	simple	surfaces and	basic	colors. Use	 conventional	 and	 recognizable	 iconography.	 Think	 about	 the	 universal	 “Save” icon,	the	floppy	disk.	Although	people	born	today	don’t	know	what	it	is,	they	know	it saves	stuff.	Do	the	same	for	your	app	icon;	don’t	reinvent	the	wheel.	The	good	app title	examples	above	all	have	good	icons	too,	respectively	a	notepad	icon,	a	guitar pick,	and	a	clock	icon. Use	 a	 duo-tone	 or	 tri-tone	 color	 setting.	 That	 means	 two	 or	 three	 complementary basic	colors.	Many	good	app	icons	use	white	as	the	base	color,	because	the	App	Store app	itself	is	white. Stick	to	the	trend.	Back	when	iOS	6	got	replaced	by	the	flat-design	iOS	7,	iOS	6- style	app	icons	immediately	stood	out	as	old	and	obsolete.	During	that	time	app	icons that	appeared	to	“pop	out”	were	popular.	These	days,	almost	all	well-performing	app icons	are	flat	duo-tone	illustrations.  One	more	thing:	your	app	icon	also	represents	your	app	on	a	user’s	home	screen.	Keep that	in	mind	during	its	design,	and	make	sure	you	pick	an	app	name	 below	the	icon,	on the	homescreen 	that	captures	your	app’s	function	in	one	word.  Screenshots  With	 screenshots	 you	 can	 give	 a	 potential	 user	 a	 peek	 inside	 your	 app,	 before	 they’ve   installed	it.	In	the	App	Store,	two	screenshots	are	shown	when	using	the	search	function, but	no	screenshots	are	shown	when	browsing	a	top	list.	When	opening	the	app	page	in	the App	 Store,	 all	 screenshots	 are	 shown	  two	 at	 a	 time .	 Of	 course,	 the	 appropriate screenshots	are	shown	on	individual	device	models. A	screenshot	is	often	an	image	of	the	UI	of	several	in-app	screens,	which	isn’t	optimal. See,	when	a	user	sees	your	app	in	the	App	Store,	they’re	asking	three	questions:  1.	 What	is	this	app	for? 2.	 What’s	in	it	for	me?	 Why	should	I	use	it?  3.	 How	can	I	use	this	app?  When	one	question	results	in	a	negative	decision,	i.e.	“This	app	isn’t	for	me”,	the	next questions	aren’t	asked.	That’s	why	it’s	so	important	to	have	a	solid	app	title.	The	question “What’s	this	app	for?”	is	answered	by	the	title	of	your	app,	and	especially	by	the	keywords inside	its	title. The	 screenshots	 of	 the	 UI	 of	 your	 app	 answers	 question	 three.	 A	 user	 will	 try	 to understand	the	user	interface	design	of	your	app,	and	ascertain	whether	or	not	your	app can	be	used	to	get	to	the	goal	they	have	in	mind. Unfortunately,	this	leaves	question	two	unanswered.	Potential	customers	have	to	find	out on	their	own	how	they	can	use	your	app,	and	often	don’t	see	the	benefit	of	using	your	app. Fortunately,	there’s	a	solution.	Instead	of	showing	screenshots	of	the	user	interface	of	your app,	create	images	that	include	the	UI	but	puts	one	or	two	sales	copy	lines	above	it.	You may	have	seen	it	before:	an	image	that	shows	an	iPhone	with	the	app’s	UI,	and	above	it tells	 you	 something	 about	 the	 app	 itself.	 Including	 key	 benefits	 as	 text	 inside	 an	 app screenshot	allows	you	to	explain	your	app	and	sell	it’s	UI	at	the	same	time. When	deciding	on	what	text	to	put	above	the	app	screenshot,	keep	the	following	heuristics in	mind:  Use	your	keywords.	By	now	you	know	what	words	a	potential	user	uses	to	describe your	app,	so	make	sure	the	same	keywords	are	visible	in	the	screenshot	text	too. List	benefits	of	your	app,	not	features.	Many	apps	use	texts	like	“Store	unlimited	to- do’s”	or	“Play	over	a	1000	levels!”.	Such	messages	don’t	answer	the	“What’s	in	it	for me?”	 question,	 they	 only	 bluntly	 list	 features.	 Instead	 of	 features,	 list	 benefits: “Cashflow	planning	for	startups”,	or	“Intuitive	task	management	that	gets	out	of	your way”,	or	“See	your	account	balance	at	a	glance”. When	 using	 extra	 graphics	 in	 the	 image,	 don’t	 distract	 the	 user	 from	 the	 main message.	 Use	 solid	 color	 background,	 not	 photographs,	 and	 do	 not	 include	 extra graphic	elements	such	as	fancy	text	boxes	or	icons.	When	using	an	actual	smartphone image,	do	not	use	the	real	photos	of	it,	but	instead	use	a	simple	recognizable	vector illustration.  You	can	include	one	video	too.	It’s	shown	alongside	the	app	screenshots	and	it’s	a	great way	to	portray	the	functionality	of	your	app,	and	build	trust	with	the	user.	In	your	video, include	the	key	benefits	of	your	app	and	use	a	voice-over	to	explain	them.	Again,	don’t   distract	the	user	with	too	many	graphics	and	keep	it	under	20	seconds.  Expanding	The	Reach	Of	Your	App  Now	that	you’ve	optimized	the	primary	assets	of	your	app,	it’s	time	to	leverage	the	actual users	 of	 it.	 Of	 course,	 this	 is	 also	 the	 time	 to	 find	 marketing	 channels	 outside	 the	 App Store	to	make	potential	customers	aware	of	your	product. Such	marketing	channels	can	include:  Making	use	of	In-App	Deeplinking,	a	technology	that’s	used	to	create	links	to	native content	of	your	app	in	the	same	way	a	web	page	hyperlinks	to	another	web	page. Getting	 featured	 by	 news	 and	 review	 channels	 such	 as	 TechCrunch,	 Mashable, Gizmodo	and	CNET. Integrating	your	app	with	content	on	Pinterest	 called	App	Pins 	and	Twitter	 called App	Cards ,	mixing	it	with	native	platform	conversations. Using	 conventional	 marketing	 strategies,	 such	 as	 social	 media	 content	 marketing, advertising,	and	working	with	an	affiliate	network.  The	goal	of	using	these	strategies	is	to	get	more	people	to	see	your	App	Store	page	and potentially	 install	 your	 app.	 With	 App	 Store	 Optimization	 you’ve	 made	 sure	 that	 more people	will	install	your	app,	but	when	nobody	sees	your	app	page	in	the	first	place	you’re still	 not	 getting	 any	 installs.	 By	 driving	 more	 traffic	 towards	 your	 app	 page,	 you’ll leverage	App	Store	Optimization	to	generate	more	installs.  App	Reviews	And	Customer	Relations  The	last	and	final	key	point	of	App	Store	Optimization	is	app	ratings	and	reviews.	The amount	 of	 positive	 ratings	 and	 the	 amount	 of	 app	 downloads	 greatly	 influences	 your ranking	in	the	App	Store.	Now	that	you’ve	gained	some	initial	traction	for	your	app,	it’s time	to	use	those	first	installers	to	your	advantage. Research	indicates	that	users	that	have	a	negative	experience	with	your	app	are	33%	more likely	 to	 leave	 a	 review.	 Of	 course,	 such	 a	 review	 will	 have	 a	 negative	 effect	 on	 the ranking	of	your	app.	The	same	research	concludes	that	59%	of	potential	customers	usually or	always	check	the	rating	of	an	app	before	they	download	an	app. Dating	 app	 Tinder	 introduced	 a	 paid	 upgrade	 for	 their	 app	 for	 functionality	 that	 was previously	free.	Customers	didn’t	take	well	to	the	change	and	left	thousands	of	negative reviews,	demoting	the	app	from	5	stars	to	1.5	and	cutting	the	app’s	ranking	in	half	 55th	to 105th .	Simply	put:	ratings	matter,	not	only	for	ranking	but	also	for	acquiring	users. Getting	positive	ratings	and	reviews	for	your	app	involves	two	key	points:  Asking	for	a	rating	at	the	right	time Avoiding	negative	reviews	by	building	a	relationship	with	the	customer  You’ve	probably	seen	it	before:	after	you’ve	used	the	app	for	a	while,	it	asks	if	you	want to	rate	the	app.	This	mechanic	is	very	effective	for	getting	positive	reviews	from	users	that   are	less	likely	to	write	a	review	on	their	own.	To	ensure	success	of	the	feature,	make	sure you	 ask	 for	 a	 review	 at	 the	 right	 time.	 Don’t	 ask	 for	 a	 review	 when	 a	 user	 hasn’t	 had enough	time	to	use	and	evaluate	your	app.	Ideally,	you	want	to	ask	for	a	review	when	a user	has	just	completed	a	positive	step	or	task	within	your	app:	ticking	off	a	couple	of	to- do’s,	completing	a	game	level	or	when	experiencing	an	emotional	high. Users	that	have	had	a	negative	experience	with	an	app	are	more	likely	to	leave	a	review, compared	to	users	who	have	had	a	positive	experience	with	your	app.	It	makes	sense:	a frustrated	user	is	more	inclined	to	voice	their	frustration,	than	a	user	whose	app	is	working just	fine.	To	avoid	negative	feedback	in	the	form	of	an	app	review,	it	is	important	to	give the	unhappy	user	another	way	to	get	in	touch	with	you. Using	a	Message	and	Support	Center	in	your	app	is	a	great	way	to	lower	the	barrier	for	the user	to	get	in	touch	with	you.	When	you	implicitly	make	clear	to	a	user	that	it	is	easier	to contact	you	and	get	an	issue	resolved	than	throwing	dirt	in	an	app	review,	you’re	hitting two	birds	with	one	stone:	the	user	doesn’t	write	a	negative	review,	and	you	have	a	chance to	start	a	conversation	and	make	things	right.	It’s	more	expensive	to	acquire	a	new	user than	it	is	to	keep	a	current	one. Several	 companies	 offer	 products	 with	 a	 customer	 relations	 Support	 Center,	 including Intercom,	AppTentive,	Urban	Airship	and	Zendesk.   Getting	Started	With	Deeplinking:	The	Internet	Of	Apps  Remember,	back	in	the	nineties,	when	Google	and	other	search	engines	didn’t	exist	yet? Back	then,	the	only	way	for	a	user	to	reach	another	web	page	was	via	a	hyperlink.	All	web users	had,	in	terms	of	discovery,	was	a	big	list	called	Jerry	and	David’s	Guide	to	the	World Wide	Web,	now	known	as	Yahoo!. The	way	the	internet	evolved	up	to	today	makes	it	almost	impossible	to	think	of	it	as	a	big bunch	of	pages	hyperlinking	to	each	other.	Thanks	to	search	engines,	content	aggregators, social	media,	and	discovery	and	recommendation	systems	we	can	now	navigate	billions	of websites	and	still	find	what	we’ve	been	looking	for. In	a	sense,	the	app	industry	is	still	in	its	nineties.	The	Apple	App	Store	is	a	rich-media example	of	that	first	web	directory	from	Yahoo!‘s	Jerry	and	David:	it’s	a	huge	list	of	apps. Apart	from	text,	images	and	catalog-style	links	there’s	not	much	contextual	information available.	Each	day	about	300	apps	get	published	in	the	iOS	App	Store	alone,	but	most	of them	never	even	get	close	to	the	Top	100	list.	Many	perfectly	good	apps	go	by	largely unnoticed,	due	to	the	nature	of	the	app	stores.  The	Long	Tail	Of	Apps  You	 could	 see	 the	 app	 stores	 as	 a	 long	 tail	 market.	 The	 term	 “long	 tail”	 is	 based	 in statistics	and	economics,	a	power	law	that	defines	a	distribution	with	two	parts:	the	“hit head”	and	the	“long	tail”.	In	the	head,	the	big	brands	and	companies	of	this	world	reside, making	up	a	large	part	of	the	market.	The	long	tail,	consisting	of	small	niche	companies, make	up	the	other	part	of	the	market. An	interesting	characteristic	of	a	long	tail	market	is	that	both	the	hit	head	and	the	long	tail have	an	equal	surface	and	size.	In	terms	of	marketing,	it’s	easier	to	focus	marketing	effort on	a	smaller	niche	market	inside	the	long	tail	than	on	beating	a	huge	brand	inside	the	hit head.	 Another	 metric	 is	 this:	 the	 long	 tail	 is	 potentially	 infinite,	 given	 that	 you	 have	 a means	to	reach	a	niche	market	inside	the	tail.   A	Long	Tail	Distribution,	Wikipedia A	good	example	of	the	long	tail	at	work	is	Spotify.	Just	like	any	other	market,	big	artists rule	the	top	of	the	charts.	Smaller	artists	however	can	still	serve	a	potential	market,	thanks to	 Spotify’s	 contextual	 recommendation	 and	 search	 engine.	 Music	 is	 defined	 with	 extra information:	tags,	genre,	subgenre,	beats	per	minute,	ratings,	curated	content,	content	from 3rd	 parties,	 and	 so	 on.	 They’ve	 opened	 up	 the	 long	 tail	 of	 music	 to	 the	 general	 public, giving	 artists	 a	 means	 to	 define	 themselves	 in	 a	 niche	 market.	 It	 would	 not	 have	 been possible	with	traditional	radio	and	TV.	Traditional	charts	would	only	list	the	biggest	hits and	leave	the	equally	big	but	smaller	markets	undiscoverable. These	days,	there’s	an	app	for	just	about	anything.	Unfortunately,	most	of	these	apps	are undiscoverable	 because	 they	 do	 not	 expose	 any	 searchable	 contextual	 information.	 The app	stores	only	focus	on	a	Top	10	list	and	featured	apps,	and	their	search	engines	can	only dig	 up	 keywords	 in	 plain	 text	 in	 an	 app’s	 description.	 The	 app	 stores	 follow	 the characteristics	of	a	long	tail	distribution,	because	they	have	an	endless	potential	for	narrow niche	markets.	One	thing	is	missing,	however:	discoverability.  Discovery:	Pinterest,	Twitter	and	Facebook  A	great	solution	for	app	publishers	to	make	their	apps	more	discoverable	is	to	add	it	to their	 respective	 pages	 on	 Pinterest,	 Facebook	 and	 Twitter.	 Quite	 recently,	 Apple	 joined forces	with	Pinterest	to	allow	users	to	install	apps	directly	from	within	Pinterest	with	so- called	App	Pins.	Any	user	can	add	an	app	to	a	board	on	Pinterest,	and	combine	it	with native	Pinterest	content.	That	means	you	can	create	pins,	like	recipes	for	pies,	and	mix them	with	a	recipe	app,	for	instance. Twitter	has	App	Cards,	a	card	similar	to	native	tweets.	A	company	can	mix	their	Twitter conversations	with	a	promoted	App	Card,	or	pin	the	App	Card	to	the	top	of	their	stream.	A user	and	potential	customer,	already	talking	the	brand,	can	discover	a	relevant	app	native to	the	conversation. In	 the	 same	 way,	 Facebook	 allows	 advertisers	 to	 push	 their	 apps	 to	 an	 audience.	 It’s	 a great	way	to	introduce	an	app	in	a	contextual	stream	that	already	exists	and	is	native	to	the platform,	making	the	barrier	to	interact	with	a	user	to	evoke	an	app	install	considerably lower.  Contextual	Deeplinking	Of	Content:	A	Web	Of	Apps  The	big	link	is	still	missing:	interconnected	contextual	information.	Like	a	search	engine connects	 web	 pages	 on	 the	 internet,	 an	 app	 search	 engine	 could	 expose	 the	 content available	 in	 any	 app.	 Unfortunately,	 all	 apps	 are	 closed	 binaries:	 they	 expose	 little information	about	what’s	inside. Deeplinking	means	two	things:	exposing	integral	content	from	within	an	app,	and	creating a	system	that	makes	the	content	searchable	and	discoverable.	When	you	read	a	pie	recipe online,	you	should	be	able	to	search	for	that	same	recipe	without	having	to	download	and install	an	app	for	it	first.   The	 key	 element	 of	 a	 deeplinking	 system	 that’s	 searchable	 is	 the	 discoverability	 of contextual	content.	Contextual	content	is	different	in	every	situation:	for	music,	it’s	genre and	BPM,	but	for	recipes,	it’s	ingredients	and	cooking	times.	The	nature	of	content	asks for	flexibility	of	a	deeplinking	system,	and	introduces	a	great	difficulty	in	categorizing	all information	available	in	apps.  Opportunities	For	App	Publishers  A	 technical	 method	 for	 the	 first	 element	 of	 deeplinking,	 exposing	 content,	 is	 already available.	Apps	can	expose	a	URL	Scheme	to	other	apps	and	web	pages.	They’re	similar	to ordinary	web	page	URLs	and	look	like	this:	my-app:  recipe [recipeID].	When	a	user clicks	on	a	link	that	has	a	URL	that’s	exposed	by	an	app,	the	user	is	taken	to	that	app.	The app	itself	can	then	serve	the	right	content,	such	as	a	news	article. URL	 Schemes	 have	 two	 downsides:	 they	 don’t	 work	 when	 an	 app	 is	 not	 installed,	 and there’s	no	structured	way	to	“ask”	an	app	what	kind	of	URL	Schemes	it	exposes. Products	and	companies	like	Branch	Metrics	and	AppLinks.org	try	to	change	that. Branch	Metrics	developed	a	system	that	makes	it	easy	to	refer	a	new	customer	to	content in	your	app,	by	sending	them	to	a	“Tell	A	Friend”	page.	AppLinks.org,	partnering	with Facebook	and	Parse,	attempts	to	create	a	big	network	of	available	deeplinks	in	apps	with the	Facebook	Index	API. Combining	these	two	technologies,	App	Makers	can:  Let	 existing	 customers	 refer	 potential	 customers	 to	 relevant	 content	 in	 your	 app. When	Alice	finds	an	interesting	recipe	for	Bob,	she	can	send	a	deeplink	to	him	and potentially	bring	in	a	new	customer. Using	AppLinks,	map	content	from	the	web	to	your	app	by	exposing	URL	Schemes to	the	Facebook	Index	API.  Startup	Deeplink.me	recently	launched	their	product	AppWords.	It	tries	to	do	what	Google did	with	AdWords:	advertise	deeplinks	based	on	search	context.	With	their	platform,	App Makers	can	advertise	native	content	and	send	potential	customers	directly	into	their	app. For	 now,	 such	 advertisements	 only	 work	 when	 a	 user	 already	 has	 the	 advertised	 app installed.   Getting	Started	With	App	Analytics  App	Analytics:	What	Is	It	And	What’s	It	Good	For?  In	2015,	Apple	launched	its	beta	campaign	for	iTunes	Connect	App	Store	Analytics.	It’s Apple’s	proprietary	tool	for	measuring	conversions	on	an	apps	page	in	the	App	Store	and tracking	user	behavior	and	engagement	within	the	app.  App	Analytics The	new	tool	has	sparked	interest	in	the	app	community.	It	was	initially	available	on	a first-come	first-serve	basis,	which	usually	means	there’s	a	healthy	amount	of	buzz	around it. The	 App	 Analytics	 industry	 is	 a	 highly	 competitive	 one.	 Googling	 for	 the	 simple	 term “app	analytics”	gives	you	a	multitude	of	toolsets:  App	Annie,	analytics	insights	based	on	scraped	data	from	the	App	Store Flurry,	a	framework	to	measure	in-app	statistics Google	Analytics,	a	framework	that	is	similar	to	Flurry,	from	the	analytics	behemoth itself   Parse,	offering	a	complete	app	analytics	suite	in	addition	to	cloud	storage	and	push notifications  All	these	tools	offer	similar	functionality,	but	all	do	so	in	their	own	fashion.	Parse	offers	a complete	product	set,	App	Annie	simply	knows	every	data	point	in	the	app	industry,	and Google	Analytics	and	Flurry	will	track	every	possible	in-app	metric. In	such	a	competitive	zero-sum	market,	how	is	App	Analytics	from	Apple	going	to	make	a difference? Let’s	look	at	the	most	valuable	metrics	first.  Conversion	Rate:	The	No.	Of	Successful	Installs  The	term	conversion	simply	means	how	many	people	go	from	A	to	B,	where	A	is	a	certain spot	where	your	target	demographic	hangs	out,	and	B	is	the	money-generating	place	of your	choice.	You	can	direct	users	from	a	Facebook	advertisement	 A 	to	your	app	sales page	 B ,	or	from	your	app	sales	page	 A 	to	a	successful	app	install	on	a	users	device	 B . The	 percentage	 of	 users	 that	 successfully	 makes	 the	 step	 from	 A	 to	 B	 is	 called	 the conversion	rate. Say	you	show	100	users	an	app	advertisement	on	Facebook	for	$	50.	Of	those	100	users, 10	 install	 your	 application.	 It’s	 a	 conversion	 rate	 of	 10%,	 with	 a	 cost	 per	 acquisition  CPA 	of	$	5.	Then,	if	you	have	a	method	of	generating	revenue	from	those	acquired	users and	you	track	the	purchases	they	make	 or	in-app	advertisement	clicks ,	you	could	find that	these	10	users	will	collectively	bring	in	$	100.	When	you	trace	that	back,	you’ve	spent $	50	to	generate	$	100.	That’s	a	return	on	investment	 ROI 	of	200	%. If	you	can	predictably	generate	these	results	over	and	over	again	 with	a	slight	deviation , you	can	tweak	your	conversion	rates.	If	you	spend	double	the	amount	on	advertising,	you make	twice	that	amount	back.	But	if	you	manage	to	reach	twice	as	many	users	with	your	$ 50	 i.e.	cheaper	cost	per	click 	and	retain	the	conversion	rate,	you	make	4	times	as	much. Ultimately,	 you’ll	 want	 to	 increase	 the	 conversions	 within	 the	 sales	 process.	 It’s	 much easier	 to	 optimize	 your	 app	 page	 in	 the	 App	 Store	  with	 better	 copy,	 screenshots	 and reviews 	than	it	is	to	get	cheaper	advertisements.	Within	your	app	you	can	optimize	too: how	many	users	make	it	to	the	checkout	page	or	Point-Of-Sale?	Increase	those	numbers and	you’ll	see	your	revenue	go	up.  Growth	And	Churn	Rate:	More	Customers	In	Than	Out  It’s	 true	 that	 acquiring	 a	 new	 user	 is	 much	 more	 expensive	 than	 keeping	 a	 current customer. To	acquire	a	new	user	you	have	to	spend	money,	for	example	with	direct	advertising	or	on building	up	a	content	marketing	strategy.	Keeping	an	existing	user	is	a	matter	of	keeping them	engaged,	which	usually	costs	less.	Also,	your	business	only	grows	when	you	acquire two	new	customers	when	one	steps	out	the	door. These	two	metrics	are	known	as	growth	rate	and	churn	rate.	They’re	relatively	simple:	the   former	is	the	amount	of	users	you	acquire	over	a	certain	time	period,	and	the	latter	is	the amount	of	users	you	lose	over	that	same	period.	For	your	business	to	thrive	as	a	whole, your	growth	rate	must	be	greater	than	your	churn	rate. Churn	rate	only	applies	to	businesses	that	sell	repeatedly.	There’s	no	point	in	measuring churn	rate	for	a	one-off	product-based	business,	such	as	selling	high	value	items	that	are bought	 once	 in	 a	 lifetime.	 Still,	 businesses	 like	 book	 shops	 and	 car	 dealerships	 wish	 to retain	their	client	base	to	make	future	sales	possible.  Engagement	And	Life	Time	Value:	Capitalizing	On	Growth  The	ultimate	metric	in	analytics	is	engagement.	It’s	an	intuitive	term,	fluid,	and	hard	to express	in	simple	numbers.	How	do	you	measure	engagement? A	few	examples:  Your	app	is	engaged	for	50%	of	its	potential	if	half	of	your	customers	opens	it	in	a certain	period. The	engagement	of	one	single	user	is	100%	if	he	completes	four	tasks	within	your app	 i.e.	opens	the	app,	creates	an	account,	shops	for	items	and	marks	one	article	as	a favourite . A	users	engagement	is	100%	if	he	or	she	opens	the	app	in	a	certain	period,	and	is	then 200%	if	he	or	she	opens	the	app	again	before	the	expiry	of	a	next	period.  User	engagement	is	highly	influenced	by	gravity,	i.e.	over	time	the	engagement	of	a	user will	 inevitably	 fall	 unless	 you	 do	 something	 to	 counter	 that.	 Ultimately,	 engagement	 is determined	by	churn	rate.	Your	business	can	grow	in	terms	of	newly	acquired	users,	and that	growth	can	even	exceed	your	churn	rate,	but	if	you	cannot	keep	a	user	engaged	for	a multiple	of	periods,	your	engagement	is	still	low. In	the	end,	the	engagement	of	your	users	determines	the	Life	Time	Value	 LTV 	of	a	user: how	much	revenue	does	a	single	customer	bring	in	during	its	time	with	your	business? Say	 you’ve	 acquired	 12.000	 new	 users	 in	 one	 year	  evenly	 distributed ,	 and	 the engagement	in	a	1-month	period	is	50%.	In	other	words:	after	1	month	you	lose	50%	of the	customers	you	acquired	in	that	period.	The	next	month	you’ll	be	left	with	25%	of	the originally	 acquired	 users,	 and	 after	 3	 months	 with	 0%.	 Any	 user	 will	 stay	 on	 for	 a maximum	of	3	months,	so	that’s	the	time	you	have	to	sell	them	something.	On	average, how	many	users	do	you	have	each	month? An	example:  On	January	1st	you	get	1000	new	users. On	February	1st	you	have	1000	+	500	=	1500	users. On	March	1st	you	have	1000	+	500	+	250	=	1750	users. On	April	1st	you	have	1000	+	500	+	250	+	0	users.  Each	and	every	month	you	end	up	with	1750	users	on	average,	given	that	you	don’t	count the	first	3	and	last	3	months	of	any	business	period	longer	than	6	months	 or	assume	you   hit	the	ground	running . Keeping	 your	 level	 of	 engagement	 high	 is	 the	 ultimate	 lever	 in	 retaining	 your	 current business.	Upping	the	engagement	will	increase	the	LTV	of	a	single	user,	and	will	make your	return-on-investment	from	a	user	acquisition	higher.  How	Is	App	Analytics	From	Apple	Going	To	Change	This?  All	 current	 analytics	 tools	 will	 give	 you	 perfect	 insight	 into	 churn	 rate,	 growth	 rate, engagement	and	a	number	of	less	important	metrics.	The	tools	measure	events	per	single user,	 and	 can	 base	 engagement	 off	 of	 that.	 When	 you	 combine	 that	 data	 with	 your Facebook	 Ad	 spending,	 you	 can	 effectively	 determine	 the	 cost	 and	 revenue	 of	 a	 single user. What’s	missing? The	conversion	of	the	App	Store	itself!	Right	now,	there’s	no	way	you	can	measure	how well	your	App	Store	page	is	performing.	You	can	try	it	out	of	course,	change	something and	see	if	conversion	goes	up.	But	can	you	reliably	measure	it?	No. Thanks	 to	 this	 gap	 in	 the	 whole	 chain,	 from	 Facebook	 Ad	 to	 a	 customer	 leaving	 your business,	you	can’t	effectively	measure	the	lifetime	of	a	single	user.	Apple	has	mentioned you	can	do	the	following	things	with	their	new	product:  See	how	often	customers	visit	your	app’s	page	on	the	App	Store Find	out	how	many	of	your	users	open	your	app	over	time Create	custom	campaign	links	and	follow	the	success	of	your	marketing	campaigns Understand	which	websites	refer	the	most	users  The	second	last	point	is	the	most	important:	you	can	connect	a	campaign	to	a	particular link,	so	you	can	track	which	users	from	which	campaigns	install	your	app.	Combine	that with	a	before-install	web	cookie	and	you	can	effectively	track	a	single	user	from	before acquisition	all	the	way	into	the	app.  Note:	users	with	an	iTunes	Connect	account	can	sign	up	for	App	Analytics	here.    How	Did	You	End	Up	Here?  Every	year	my	former	education	institute,	the	place	where	I	studied,	asks	me	if	I	want	to speak	to	highschool	students.	I’m	always	happy	to,	although	each	year	one	of	the	students asks	an	incredibly	tough	question:	“How	 did	 you	 know	 you	 wanted	 to	 be	 what	 you	 are today?” It’s	an	incredibly	logical	question.	The	highschool	students	have	to	figure	out	what	they want	in	life,	because	the	system	tells	them	to	do	that.	So,	they	ask	me	the	question	that will	put	their	decision	in	perspective.	Unfortunately	I	can’t	answer	the	question.	I	have	no idea	how	I	ended	up	here. Usually,	they	can’t	come	up	with	a	name	for	what	I	do.	I’m	a	mix	between	app	developer, product	marketer,	drug	dealer	and	online	ninja. I	don’t	know	how	I	got	here.	I	never	took	a	conscious	decision	to	do	what	I	do	today.	Yes, I	have	affinity	with	technology,	but	apps	weren’t	around	when	I	learned	programming.	My first	computer	was	a	66	Mhz	i386	with	Windows	3.1. My	mindset	got	me	where	I	am	today.	It’s	how	I	think	that	matters:  1.	 I’m	an	individual	and	the	world	doesn’t	give	a	single	iota	whether	I	get	out	of	bed	in  the	morning.  2.	 I	want	to	improve	who	I	am	today	to	be	someone	better	tomorrow. 3.	 I’m	a	rebel.	Tell	me	what	to	do	and	I’ll	do	the	opposite.  Great	 men	 and	 women	 will	 tell	 you	 that	 your	 thoughts	 will	 become	 a	 reality;	 a	 self- fulfilling	prophecy.	Most	people	think	this	only	works	for	negative	thoughts,	but	it	works for	positive	constructive	thoughts	too.	Believe	you	will	be	great,	and	you	will	be. You	can’t	have	a	worse	mindset	than	this:  1.	 You	don’t	do	what	you	want 2.	 You’re	not	happy	with	who	or	where	you	are,	and	don’t	change 3.	 You	don’t	improve	yourself	 when	you’re	able	to	do	so   Take	a	look	at	the	animal	kingdom	and	tell	me	what	makes	us	humans	so	different.	We’re not	 the	 most	 resilient	 out	 there.	 We	 aren’t	 the	 fastest	 runners,	 the	 deepest	 divers,	 the strongest	lifters,	and	we	don’t	survive	in	outer	space.	What	sets	us	apart? We’ve	 got	 the	 most	 developed	 brains,	 and	 we	 have	 the	 ability	 to	 reflect	 on	 our	 own thoughts.	Essentially,	we’ve	got	free	will	and	the	will	to	go	against	that.	Cognitively	we can	look	360	degrees	around	us,	on	infinite	axis. Yet,	most	of	us	only	look	one	way	and	keep	moving	in	that	direction,	regardless	of	what happens	around	us.	There’s	nothing	wrong	with	being	a	zombie,	as	long	as	you	want	to	be a	zombie!  If	you	don’t	like	where	you	are,	move.	You’re	not	a	tree!	-	Jim	Rohn   Are	you	waiting	for	a	sign?	This	is	it. A	few	years	back	I	was	close	to	graduating	and	I	had	no	idea	what	I	wanted	to	do	after	it. Back	then	I	had	spent	6	months	in	a	business	incubator,	working	on	a	business	idea,	and	I had	to	decide	whether	I	wanted	to	stay	with	them	or	work	on	something	else. I	reached	out	to	a	very	successful	entrepreneur	and	this	is	what	he	said:  Most	 people	 don’t	 know	 what	 they	 want.	 Most	 people	 that	 know	 what	 they	 want don’t	do	anything	about	it.	So	if	you	are	one	of	the	few	that	knows	what	you	want, and	is	prepared	to	work	very	very	hard	to	get	it,	you’ll	do	very	well.	If	being	in	this incubator	 is	 important	 to	 you,	 find	 out	 what	 it	 would	 take	 to	 stay	 there,	 then	 go “above	and	beyond”	to	make	sure	you	do.	Prove	your	worth,	pull	strings	or	favors,	do whatever	it	takes.	There	will	be	other	times	in	life	when	you	don’t	know	what	you want,	so	take	advantage	of	the	rare	times	that	you	do.  His	advice	led	me	to	first	figure	out	what	I	wanted,	and	then	take	the	decision.	Prior	to asking	advice	I	hadn’t	laid	out	my	options,	I	was	trying	to	take	a	yes	or	no	decision	on	one action	I	could	take. By	getting	a	perspective	on	the	next	6-12	months	and	my	personal	goals	for	that	time,	I could	take	an	informed	decision.	Ultimately,	I	didn’t	stay	with	the	incubator	and	started what	would	become	a	very	successful	app	production	agency.   Getting	Started	With	Personal	Effectiveness  Ever	wondered	why	successful	people	are	successful?	Why	is	it	that	they	seem	to	attract success	and	not	chase	after	it?	And	how	does	that	apply	that	to	the	App	Making	business? Learn	the	three	traits	successful	people	have	and	if	you’re	new	to	those	traits,	learn	how	to develop	them. Success	is	not	something	that	you	can	buy,	unfortunately.	We	all	know	that,	but	we	are	all still	looking	for	ways	to	influence	the	odds	in	our	favor.	What	if	I	told	you	there	is	no	way to	become	successful?	Would	you	believe	me? We	often	mistake	success	and	luck.	It’s	our	way	of	thinking,	when	we	meet	or	learn	about someone	 successful:	 “Oh,	 he	 must	 have	 gotten	 lucky!”	 and	 “She	 must	 be	 special,	 of influence,	or	been	at	the	right	place	at	the	right	time.”	The	people	that	think	this	way	will never	 be	 successful	 and	 never	 will	 experience	 getting	 lucky,	 because	 they’ve	 got	 it	 all backwards.	Being	successful	is	not	something	that	happens	to	you,	it	is	something	you	can actively	cause. How	do	you	do	that?	Develop	the	following	three	traits.  Be	Pragmatic  Being	pragmatic	means	that	you	think	in	an	activating	and	practical	way.	That	sounds	like stating	the	obvious,	but	do	you	know	how	many	people	stare	at	a	problem	and	wait	until	it solves	itself? Stop	complaining,	procrastinating,	gossiping,	being	lazy,	victimizing	or	being	jealous.	It’s not	practical,	and	outside-in	focused:	you	take	what’s	external	to	you,	inside	yourself. Instead,	 if	 something	 goes	 wrong,	 seek	 fault	 with	 yourself.	 See	 that	 there’s	 a	 process behind	the	problem,	and	that	the	solution	does	not	lie	in	combatting	its	symptoms,	but	in finding	the	root	cause	of	the	problem.	The	root	cause	is	not	something	that	you’ll	replace, but	you’ll	tweak	it	until	the	problem	changes	into	a	desirable	outcome.	Understand	that problems	you’re	blamed	for	are	the	same	problems	you	can	solve. I	once	had	a	client	that	had	to	deliver	some	graphic	material	before	I	could	get	to	work.	It took	them	a	very	long	time	to	come	up	with	the	materials,	because	they	were	busy.	That screwed	 up	 my	 schedule,	 because	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 when	 I	 could	 start	 working.	 For	 some time,	I	tried	to	chase	them,	sent	them	emails	asking	for	status	updates,	even	implored	them to	do	their	job.	It	did	not	work.	What	was	I	doing	wrong?	I	expected	that	by	just	stating the	 problem,	 they’d	 be	 nice	 enough	 to	 solve	 it.	 I	 was	 wrong;	 they	 had	 totally	 different priorities	than	me. How’d	 I	 ultimately	 resolve	 the	 issue?	 Technically,	 I	 didn’t.	 I	 went	 to	 work	 for	 another client	 and	 just	 waited	 until	 the	 initial	 client	 had	 done	 its	 work.	 What	 happened?	 It	 still screwed	up	my	schedule,	but	I	warned	the	client	about	that.	Of	course,	a	couple	of	weeks later	I	was	busy	with	another	client.	I	notified	the	client	again,	telling	them	I	used	the	time reserved	 for	 them,	 for	 another	 client	 to	 remain	 productive.	 They	 didn’t	 like	 it,	 but understood.   You	might	want	to	call	this	“pro-active”,	but	just	call	it	pragmatic.	It’s	taking	action	when there	is	inaction,	and	refraining	from	action	when	everything	is	stuck. How	do	you	practice	being	pragmatic?  1.	 Next	time	you	face	a	problem,	try	to	understand	why	the	problem	is	occurring	in	the  first	place.	How	does	the	system	behind	it	work?	Why	does	it	work	like	that?  2.	 Like	the	famous	Captain	Jack	Sparrow	says	in	the	pirate	movie:	“The	problem	is	not the	problem,	your	attitude	about	the	problem	is	the	problem.”	Practice	this	by	leaving a	problem	for	what	it	is	until	it	develops	a	problem	with	you,	just	like	I	did	with	my client.  3.	 Action,	action,	action.	Develop	a	sense	of	discomfort	whenever	there	is	inaction.	A  standstill	is	going	backwards.	Be	ready	to	move.	Be	impulsive.  Never	Stop	Learning  Einstein	once	said	that	“education	is	what	remains	after	one	has	forgotten	everything	he learned	in	school.”	You	can	interpret	that	as:	your	learning	ability	shapes	you	and	makes you	stronger.	To	benefit	from	that	forever,	you	must	never	stop	learning.	To	be	educated	is to	be	learning,	not	to	have	learned. To	be	an	active	learner,	do	the	following	things:  1.	 Find	out	what	your	learning	style	is.	There	are	several	academic	models	for	types	of learning,	but	don’t	dive	into	them.	Answer	a	simple	question:	when	was	the	last	time you	learned	something	substantial	and	how	did	you	learn	that?	Examples:	by	reading a	 book,	 by	 watching	 a	 video,	 by	 trying	 something	 out	 and	 failing,	 by	 listening	 to someone,	by	storytelling,	by	imitating	someone,	by	inventing,	or	just	by	finding	out you	already	know	something	by	accident?  2.	 Try	 out	 whether	 your	 learning	 method	 fits	 you	 by	 actively	 looking	 for	 a	 skill	 or knowledge	 item	 you	 can	 learn	 via	 this	 just-found	 method.	 Does	 it	 work?	 Did	 you learn	something?  3.	 Make	a	list	of	things	you	want	to	learn.	Call	them	goals.	Books	you	want	to	read, videos	you	want	to	watch,	skills	you	want	to	develop.	Get	into	the	habit	of	taking	a first	step	in	achieving	those	goals.	Set	an	overall	goal	for	yourself:	you	want	to	learn something	every	week.	Stick	to	it,	because	learning	is	a	habit.  Be	Process-Minded  Do	you	know	the	movie	Cloud	Atlas?	Haskell	Moore,	a	character	from	the	movie	says this:	“There’s	 a	 natural	 order	 to	 this	 world,	 and	 those	 who	 try	 to	 upend	 it	 do	 not	 fare well.” Fortunately	for	you,	he’s	wrong.	There	is	a	natural	order	to	this	world,	but	those	that	try	to understand	 it	 and	 change	 it	 naturally	 do	 well.	 Of	 course	 it’s	 not	 easy,	 but	 those	 who succeed,	well…	succeed! People	tend	to	perceive	the	world	by	events:	this	happens,	that	happens,	this	moment,	that   moment,	this	event,	that	event.	They	don’t	understand	that	there’s	a	generator	behind	these events:	a	process.	The	event	is	the	mere	result	of	the	process,	not	the	reason	behind	what	is happening. They	see	being	rich,	being	successful,	being	lucky,	getting	a	pay-raise,	getting	another	job, landing	 a	 client	 as	 events.	 To	 you,	 these	 occurrences	 are	 the	 result	 of	 a	 process-driven system.	 You’re	 not	 interested	 in	 the	 event,	 you	 want	 to	 know	 what	 made	 the	 event possible.	What	is	the	driving	force	behind	it	and	how	can	you	understand	it? Some	examples:  1.	 Being	rich	is	the	result	of	becoming	rich,	to	work	hard	for	years	with	no	revenue,	to tweaking	sales	and	value	proposition	until	it	fits	the	market	well.	To	understand	the way	 money	 works	 and	 to	 delay	 gratification,	 to	 work	 on	 appreciation	 instead	 of liquidating	every	asset	you	have.  2.	 Being	 successful	 is	 the	 result	 of	 knowing	 how	 to	 score	 goals.	 Ever	 had	 a	 test	 in school?	How	did	you	get	an	A+	or	10	out	of	10?	Not	by	learning	hard.	By	learning how	to	score,	by	knowing	how	to	qualify	for	the	points	that	made	up	your	grade.  3.	 Being	lucky	is	the	result	of	nothing.	There’s	no	such	thing	as	luck.	Luck	is	merely  influencing	possible	outcomes	to	yield	a	higher	probability.  How	Does	This	Apply	to	App	Making?  These	three	traits	can	be	applied	to	any	field	or	job.	They	count	in	your	personal	life,	as well	as	your	professional	endeavors.	They’re	not	exclusive	success	makers	and	will	not substitute	any	other	trait	you	think	is	useful	for	being	successful. Do	you	see	that	success	is	not	something	you	have	or	get,	but	actively	make? It’s	as	simple	as	cooking.	Good	food	doesn’t	happen	all	of	a	sudden.	Good	food	happens when	 you	 know	 what	 spices	 taste	 good,	 what	 vegetables	 go	 well	 together	 and	 in	 what order	you	should	put	them	in	the	pan.	You	know	what’s	an	excellent	ingredient	for	good food?	Love.	Make	sure	you	pay	attention	to	yourself	and	your	success	making	machine, and	it’ll	attract	success	for	you.	Just	like	good	food	attracts	lovely	people. For	more	resources,	check	out	learnappmaking.com resources.   Epilogue  The	final	chapter	in	this	book	is	short.	Here	it	goes. What	are	you	waiting	for!?

What	To	Do	When	Your	MacBook Breaks	Down	On	A	Tropical	Island  Yeah,	I’ve	been	there:	my	MacBook	broke	down	on	a	tropical	island	in	Thailand,	a	client deadline	3	hours	away	and	no	Apple	repair	shop	in	a	500	kilometer	radius.	What	do	you do?	You	pray	to	the	Apple	gods	to	have	mercy	and	you	get	your	MacGyver	face	on! In	2014	I	spent	around	3	weeks	with	a	friend	in	South	East	Asia,	traveling	to	Thailand	and Vietnam.	 We	 both	 work	 online	 and	 we’ve	 worked	 together	 on	 multiple	 occasions.	 The main	 reason	 for	 our	 journey	 was	 to	 attend	 the	 digital	 nomad	 conference	 “DCBKK”	 in Bangkok.	 Before	 the	 event	 we	 traveled	 to	 the	 tropical	 island	 of	 Koh	 Lanta	  Krabi, Thailand 	and	after	we	went	to	hectic	Ho	Chi	Minh	City	in	Vietnam. At	 the	 time	 I	 was	 very	 busy	 with	 client	 work,	 working	 on	 several	 projects	 with	 tight deadlines.	That	dreadful	day	I	had	a	stressful	deadline;	an	app	I’d	been	working	on	needed an	urgent	bug	fix.	We	had	pushed	an	app	to	the	App	Store	that	had	a	serious	bug	in	it,	so	a working	fix	for	the	bug	was	of	the	high	priority. My	friend	and	I	had	dinner	together	and	returned	to	our	hotel	to	work	some	more	during the	 evening.	 I	 opened	 my	 MacBook,	 a	 recent	 2013	 Air	 model,	 but	 the	 screen	 wouldn’t flash	on.	Most	MacBook	have	issues	with	not	getting	out	of	sleep	mode,	so	I	closed	the	lid again,	 opened	 it	 and	 pressed	 a	 few	 keys.	 That	 usually	 wakes	 it	 up,	 but	 this	 time	 no response. Sensing	 that	 it	 had	 crashed,	 I	 tried	 to	 restart	 it.	 No	 response.	 I	 went	 through	 the	 usual options:	performing	a	hard	reset,	resetting	the	PRAM	and	SMC,	but	still	no	effect.	Then	I noticed	that	there	was	light	coming	through	the	Apple	logo	on	the	lid,	and	that	I	could	see the	screen	contents	at	that	exact	spot.	The	light	that	came	through	the	logo	illuminated	the screen,	so	I	realized	the	backlight	must	broke	down. Happy	that	the	MacBook	system	itself	was	not	compromised,	I	set	out	to	create	a	working environment.	Armed	with	the	flashlight	on	my	iPhone,	I	logged	in	on	the	computer	and tried	 to	 install	 an	 app	 that	 could	 mirror	 my	 MacBook’s	 screen	 to	 my	 iPad.	 Since	 the backlight	was	broken,	the	screen	was	not	illuminated,	but	the	LCD	was	definitely	on.	With the	 reflection	 of	 the	 flashlight	 inside	 the	 screen	 cover,	 I	 basically	 created	 backlight illumination.	It	worked	partially,	because	the	same	flashlight	blocked	my	view	with	a	glare at	the	same	time. I	managed	to	get	the	screen	mirroring	to	work,	on	the	hotels	WiFi	that	was	absolutely	not strong.	One	of	the	downsites	of	being	an	app	developer	is	having	to	own	a	multitude	of devices,	and	bringing	that	with	you	on	trips.	At	this	time,	it	was	a	blessing,	because	I	had just	enough	tech	available	to	create	a	workable	environment.	The	irony	of	course	is	that relying	on	the	technology	makes	you	dependent	on	it	and	that	creates	a	problem	when	the tech	breaks	down. With	the	mirroring	I	could	work,	pushing	the	update	to	my	client.	Fun	fact:	I	had	to	boot up	 my	 Windows	 virtual	 machine	  through	 VMware	 Fusion 	 on	 the	 MacBook	 for	 some   tasks,	creating	a	Windows	on	iPad	on	MacBook	kind	of	setup.	Who	would	have	thought!? During	my	work	the	WiFi	signal	was	lost	multiple	times,	which	meant	I	had	to	restart	the mirroring	connection	with	the	flashlight	again.	You	don’t	want	to	know	how	annoying	it	is to	look	for	your	mouse	cursor	with	a	flashlight	on	a	screen	that’s	basically	pitch	dark. The	next	day	I	refrained	from	working,	emailing	my	clients	that	I	had	taken	a	couple	of days	 off	 due	 to	 the	 technical	 failure.	 It’s	 good	 to	 have	 your	 secondary	 device,	 be	 it	 a smartphone	or	tablet,	set	up	for	all	your	email	accounts	and	contacts	in	case	you	can’t	use your	laptop.	In	two	days	we’d	go	to	Bangkok,	where	I	was	sure	to	be	able	to	find	a	repair shop. In	Bangkok,	I	took	a	taxi	from	our	hotel	to	Pantip	Plaza.	This	mall	is	famous	for	housing the	largest	amount	of	illegal	copies	of	software	in	the	world	in	one	place.	I	read	online there	 was	 a	 Apple	 retailer	 there,	 so	 I	 went	 up	 to	 their	 store.	 They	 had	 repair	 options available,	they	said,	in	another	store	across	town,	but	the	repair	time	would	be	at	least	2 weeks.	I	was	only	in	Bangkok	for	3	days,	so	that	was	not	an	option.	I	pressed	them	for another	 option,	 mentioned	 that	 I	 needed	 it	 repaired	 today.	 One	 of	 them	 mentioned	 a “repair	guy”	on	the	top	floor	of	the	mall	outside	the	shopping	area. So,	up	I	went.	I	entered	the	most	densely	packed	repair	shop	I	had	ever	seen	in	my	life. There	 were	 wires	 everywhere,	 computer	 cases	 standing	 all	 around,	 and	 a	 couple	 of second-hand	 MacBooks	 on	 display.	 The	 room	 was	 filled	 with	 sweaty	 chilled	 air,	 and behind	a	shelf	sat	a	small	guy	wearing	glasses.	I	knew	I	had	come	to	the	right	place. I	persuaded	the	repair	guy	to	repair	my	MacBook	in	a	timely	manner.	He	almost	got	angry with	me	for	asking	him	to	repair	it	quicker	than	a	few	days,	mentioning	that	the	official Apple	repair	shop	would	take	2	weeks.	We	then	agreed	on	an	“unofficial”	price	and	he said	he’d	do	it	in	2	days.	I	went	back	to	the	conference,	and	that	evening	I	got	the	best email	 ever.	 It	 basically	 showed	 my	 MacBook,	 with	 a	 turned	 on	 screen,	 and	 the	 words “Repair	Ok”.	I	rushed	back	to	his	shop,	got	my	MacBook,	paid	and	even	got	a	receipt. Back	at	the	hotel	I	did	a	quick	security	sweep,	but	nothing	was	missing	or	breached.	The technical	 failure	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 a	 broken	 backlight	 inverter,	 a	 common	 error	 in MacBooks. Yay,	I	got	my	MacBook	back! What	do	I	 and	you 	learn	from	this?  1.	 Even	on	a	tropical	island	with	power	failures	every	hour,	if	you	get	creative	enough,  anything	is	possible.  a	long	way	if	applied	right.  2.	 Asking	the	right	questions	and	mentioning	the	right	things	to	the	right	people	will	go  3.	 Shit	happens.	Have	an	encrypted	backup	handy,	enough	money	to	get	a	replacement  and	possibly	an	immediate	option	of	replacement.  4.	 Keep	calm	and	have	a	Mai	Tai.	No	tech	means	more	time	to	swim	in	a	light	blue ocean	and	sip	cocktails.	Having	a	positive	mental	attitude	goes	a	very,	very,	very	long way.
