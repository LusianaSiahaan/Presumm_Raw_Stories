Learning Node.js      Addison-Wesley Learning Series   Visit informit.com learningseries for a complete list of available publications.  The Addison-Wesley Learning Series is a collection of hands-on programming  guides that help you quickly learn a new technology or language so you can  apply what you’ve learned right away.  Each title comes with sample code for the application or applications built in   the text. This code is fully annotated and can be reused in your own projects  with no strings attached. Many chapters end with a series of exercises to  encourage you to reexamine what you have just learned, and to tweak or   adjust the code as a way of learning.   Titles in this series take a simple approach: they get you going right away and  leave you with the ability to walk off and build your own application and apply  the language or technology to whatever you are working on.

Node.js is an exciting new platform for writing network and web  applications that has created a lot of buzz over the past couple of years and rapidly gathered a  sizeable following in the developer community. In this book, I teach you more about it, why  it is special, and get you up and writing Node.js programs in short order. You’ll soon find that  people are rather flexible with the name of Node.js and will refer to it frequently as just Node  or even “node.” I certainly do a lot of that in this book as well.     Why Node.js?    Node.js has arisen for a couple of primary reasons, which I explain next.     The Web    In the past, writing web applications was a pretty standard process. You have one or more  servers on your machine that listens on a port    for example, 80    for HTTP , and when a request  is received, it forks a new process or a thread to begin processing and responding to the query.  This work frequently involves communicating with external services, such as a database,  memory cache, external computing server, or even just the file system. When all this work is  finally finished, the thread or process is returned to the pool of “available” servers, and more  requests can be handled.     It is a reasonably linear process, easy to understand, and straightforward to code. There are,  however, a couple of disadvantages that continue to plague the model:       1.    2.     Each of these threads or processes carries some overhead with it. On some machines,  PHP + Apache can take up as much as 10–15MB per process. Even in environments  where a large server runs constantly and forks threads to process the requests, each of  these carries some overhead to create a new stack and execution environment, and you  frequently run into the limits of the server’s available memory.        In most common usage scenarios where a web server communicates with a database,  caching server, external server, or file system, it spends most of its time sitting around  doing nothing and waits for these services to finish and return their responses. While it is  sitting there doing nothing, this thread is effectively “blocked” from doing anything else.  The resources it consumes and the process or thread in which it runs are entirely frozen  waiting for those responses to come back.      2  Introduction  Only after the external component has finally sent back its response will that process  or thread be free to finish processing, send a response to the client, and then reset to  prepare for another incoming request.     So, although it’s pretty easy to understand and work with, you do have a model that can be  quite inefficient if your scripts spend most of their time waiting for database servers to finish  running a query—an extremely common scenario for a lot of modern web applications.     Many solutions to this problem have been developed and are in common use. You can buy  ever bigger and more powerful web servers with more memory. You can replace more powerful  and feature-rich HTTP servers such as Apache with smaller, lightweight ones such as    lighttpd  or    nginx. You can build stripped-down or reduced versions of your favorite web programing  language such as PHP or Python.  Indeed, Facebook has taken this one step further and built a  system that converts PHP to native C++ code for maximal speed and optimal size.  Or you can  throw more servers at the problem to increase the   number of simultaneous connections you  can accommodate.     New Technologies    Although the web developers of the world have continued their eternal struggle against server  resources and the limits on the number of requests they can process, a few other interesting  things have happened in the meantime.     JavaScript, that old  meaning 1995 or so  language that came to be most well known  and  frequently reviled  for writing client-side scripts in the web browser, has been growing in  popularity again. Modern versions of web browsers are cleaning up their implementations of  it and adding in new features to make it more powerful and less quirky. With the advent of  client libraries for these browsers, such as jQuery, script.aculo.us, or Prototype, programming  in JavaScript has become fun and productive. Unwieldy APIs have been cleaned up, and fun,  dynamic effects have been added.     At the same time, a new generation of browser competition has erupted, with Google’s  Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox, Apple’s Safari, and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer all vying for  the crown of browser king. As part of this, all these companies are investing heavily in the  JavaScript portion of these systems as modern web applications continue to grow ever-more  dynamic and script-based. In particular, Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript runtime is particularly  fast and also open-sourced for use by anybody.     With all these things in place, the opportunity arose for somebody to come along with a new  approach to network  web  application development. Thus, the birth of Node.js.     What Exactly Is Node.js?    In 2009, a fellow named Ryan Dahl was working for a company called Joyent, a cloud and  virtualization services company in California. He was looking to develop push capabilities for    What Exactly Is Node.js?  3  web applications, similar to how Gmail does it, and found most of what he looked at not quite  appropriate. He eventually settled on JavaScript because it lacked a robust input output  I O   model  meaning he could write his own new one  and had the fast and fully programmable V8  runtime readily available.     Inspired by some similar projects in the Ruby and Python communities, he eventually took the  Chrome V8 runtime and an event-processing library called    libev, and came up with the first  versions of a new system called Node.js.   The primary methodology or innovation in Node.js is  that it is built entirely around an event-driven nonblocking model of programming. In short,  you never  well, rarely  write code that blocks.     If your web application—in order to process a request and generate a response—needs to run  a database query, it runs the request and then tells Node.js what to do when the response  returns. In the meantime, your code is free to start processing other incoming requests or,  indeed, do any other task it might need, such as cleaning up data or running analyses.     Through this simple change in the way the application handles requests and work, you are able  to trivially write web servers that can handle hundreds, if not thousands, of requests simulta- neously on machines without much processing or memory resources. Node runs in a single  process, and your code executes largely in a single thread, so the resource requirements are  much lower than for many other platforms.     This speed and capacity come with a few caveats, however, and you need to be fully aware of  them so you can start working with Node with your eyes wide open.     First and foremost, the new model is different from what you may have seen before and can  sometimes be a bit confusing. Until you’ve wrapped your brain fully around some of the core  concepts, some of the code you see written in Node.js can seem a bit strange. Much of this  book is devoted to discussing the core patterns many programmers use to manage the chal- lenges of the asynchronous, nonblocking way of programming that Node uses and how to  develop your own.     Another limitation with this model of programming is that it really is centered around applica- tions that are doing lots of different things with lots of different processes, servers, or services.  Node.js truly shines when your web application is juggling connections to databases, caching  servers, file systems, application servers, and more. The flip side of this, however, is that it’s  actually not necessarily an optimal environment for writing compute servers that are doing  serious, long-running computations. For these, Node’s model of a single thread in a single  process can create problems if a given request is taking a ton of time   to generate a complicated  password digest or processing an image. In situations in which you’re doing more computa- tionally intensive work, you need to be careful how your applications use resources, or perhaps  even consider farming those tasks out to other platforms and run them as a service for your  Node.js programs to call.     Finally, Node.js is a reasonably new platform and under active development. It has not yet  as  of February 2013  hit version 1.0, and is constantly seeing new releases, sometimes at a truly  dizzying pace.      4  Introduction  To reduce the randomization and troubles caused by these frequent updates, the developers  have taken to labeling portions of the system with different degrees of stability   , ranging from  Unstable to Stable    to Locked   . Changes to    Stable or Locked   portions of the runtime are rare and  involve much community discussion to determine whether it will generate too much pain. As  you work your way through this book, we point out which areas are less stable than others and  suggest ways you can mitigate the dangers of changing APIs.     The good news is that Node.js already has a large and active user community and a bunch of  mailing lists, forums, and user groups devoted to promoting the platform and providing help  where needed. A simple Google search will get you answers to 99 percent of your questions in a  matter of seconds, so never be afraid to look!     Who Is This Book For?    I wrote this book under the assumption that you are comfortable programming computers and  are familiar with the functionality and syntax of at least one major programming language  such as Java, C C++, PHP, or C. Although you don’t have to be an expert, you’ve probably  moved beyond “Learn X in Y days” level tasks.     If you’re like me, you have probably written some HTML CSS JavaScript and thus have “worked  with” JavaScript, but you might not be intimately familiar with it and have just largely  templated heavily off code found on blog posts or mailing lists. Indeed, with its clunky UI  and frustrating browser mismatches, you might even frown slightly at the mere mention of  JavaScript. Fear not—by the end of the first section of this book, distasteful memories of the  language will be a thing of the past and, I hope, you’ll be happily writing your first Node.js  programs with ease and a smile on   your face!     I also assume that you have a basic understanding of how web applications work: Browsers  send HTTP requests to a remote server; the server processes that request and sends a response  with a code indicating success or failure, and then optionally some data along with that  response  such as the HTML for the page to render or perhaps JavaScript Object Notation,  or JSON, containing data for that request . You’ve probably connected to database servers in  the past, run queries, and waited for the resulting rows, and so on. When I start to describe  concepts beyond these in the samples and   programs, I explain and refresh everybody’s memory  on anything new or uncommon.     How to Use This Book    This book is largely tutorial in nature. I try to balance out explanations with code to demon- strate it as much as possible and avoid long, tedious explanations of everything. For those situ- ations in which I think a better explanation is interesting, I might point you to some resources  or other documentation to learn more if you are so inclined  but it is never a necessity .      Download the Source Code  5  The book is divided into four major sections:     Part 1 .  Learning to Walk —You start installing and running Node, take another look at  the JavaScript language and the extensions used in V8 and Node.js, and then write your  first application.     Part 2 .  Learning to Run —You start developing more powerful and interesting  application servers in this part of the book, and I start teaching you some of the core  concepts and practices used in writing Node.js programs.     Part 3 .  Breaking Out the Big Guns —In this part, you look at some of the powerful tools  and modules available to you for writing your web applications, such as help with web  servers and communication with database servers.     Part 4 .  Getting the Most Out of Node.js —Finally, I close out the book by looking at  a few other advanced topics such as ways in which you can run your applications on  production servers, how you can test your code, and how you can use Node.js to write  command-line utilities as well!     As you work your way through the book, take the time to fire up your text editor and enter the  code, see how it works in your version of Node.js, and otherwise start writing and developing  your own code as you go along. You develop your own little photo-sharing application as you  work through this book, which I hope provides you with some inspiration or ideas for things  you can write.

By the end of this chapter, you should have Node installed and  running on your computer, have entered a few small test programs to play around with it, and  know how to use the built-in Node debugger.     Installing Node.js    Let’s begin by looking at installation on Windows. Mac and Linux users should feel free to skip  ahead to the appropriate sub-section, unless you have both types of machines.     Installation on Windows    To install Node.js on a Windows machine, you can use the handy installer provided on the  nodejs.org website. Visit the Download page and then download Windows Installer  .msi  for  either 32 bits or 64 bits, depending on what platform you are running. I show the installation  for Windows 7 64-bit.     After you download the MSI, double-click on it. You should see a setup program similar to that  shown in  Figure    1.1   .      Read and accept the License Agreement and then click Install. Because the install is pretty quick  and painless, a few seconds later, you can click Finish to complete the installation.     Verifying the Installation    To test the installation of the Node software, you can use the Windows command prompt  cmd. exe .  If you are using PowerShell, that also works just fine.  If you are not familiar with this,  you can launch it by going to Start   Run and then typing  cmd , as shown in  Figure    1.2   .      10  Chapter 1  Getting Started  Figure 1.1      Windows Setup Installer     Figure 1.2      Launching the Windows command prompt     You then see a command interpreter, such as in  Figure    1.3   . If you want to learn more about  using the command prompt, search the Internet for help using the phrases “Learning to use  Windows cmd.exe” or “Getting Started with PowerShell”  if you are running Windows 7  for  more information.     Figure 1.3      The Windows command prompt      To make sure Node was installed properly, type  node -–version   in the command window.  You should see the output as in  Figure    1.4   .     Installing Node.js  11  Figure 1.4      Verifying Node is installed correctly. Check the version number.     The command prompt window should print out the version number of the Node you just  installed a few seconds ago.  Don’t worry if the number doesn’t match what you see—indeed,  I’d be surprised if it did!  If you do not see this version number, or if instead you see the output  saying that “‘node’ is not recognized as an internal or external command”  see  Figure    1.5    ,  something has gone wrong and you should do the following:                    Look in Control Panel   Programs and see whether the installation actually completed.   If not, try the install again, and pay a bit closer attention to what happens. Perhaps  something has gone wrong.        Look in  Program Files\nodejs   and make sure  node.exe   is actually there. If it is not,   try installing again.  Uninstall an old version first, if necessary.         Make sure that  node.exe   is in your  PATH   environment variable. In the command   prompt, Windows has a list of directories in which you can search when you type in the  name of a program. You can view this by simply typing  path   in the command prompt  window. It should show something similar to that in  Figure    1.6   . In particular, look at  the two highlighted directory names at the end. Something very similar to both of these  should be in your  PATH .        If  Program Files\nodejs   and  Users\..\AppData\..\npm   are not in your  PATH , but   these folders definitely do exist, you can add them to your  PATH   manually by adding  them to your  PATH   environment variable. You do this in the System Control Panel  window. Click on Advanced System Settings and then Environment Variables. Then add  the path of the  npm   folder  it is in something like  C:\Users\UserName\Local\npm   to  the  PATH   under User Variables for  Username   and add the path to the Node.js folder  it is  in something like  C:\Program Files\nodejs   to the  PATH   under System Variables. Note  that the  npm   folder might be in  Username\Remote\npm   instead of  Username\Local\npm ,  depending on how your computer   is configured.        After confirming you have  node.exe   installed and working, you can start writing JavaScript.      12  Chapter 1  Getting Started  Figure 1.5      Node is not recognized as an internal or external command.     Figure 1.6      Checking your  PATH   environment variable     Installation on the Mac    While there are two different ways you can install Node.js on the Mac—either by using the  PKG installer or by compiling from source —I’m going to show only the former. It is by far the  faster and easier way of doing things. If you are more inclined to build the node distribution  from source, I’ve included instructions in the git sources for this book.     Using the PKG Installer    By far the quickest way to install Node.js on your Apple Mac computer running OS X is to  download and run the Node PKG installer available from the nodejs.org website.     After you download the installer, double-click it, and you should see something similar to that  shown in  Figure    1.7   . I tend to use just the default installation because I want all the compo- nents, and the default path    usr local bin   is what I want. I recommend you do the same  here.      When the installation is complete, you should see something similar to that shown in  Figure  1.8   . As the package installer explains, it is important to make sure that   usr local bin   is in your  PATH   environment variable. You can open the Terminal.app program.  Go to   Applications Utilities , and launch Terminal.  In the terminal window, type     echo $PATH      Installing Node.js  13  Figure 1.7      Running the Mac PKG installer for Node.js     Figure 1.8      Make sure your path is set up correctly.     On my machine, the output is      usr bin: bin: usr sbin: sbin : usr local bin : Users marcw bin: usr local git bin     You can see that   usr local bin   is indeed here in the  PATH . If it is not, you should edit your  ~ .bash_profile   file  it’s okay to create this file if it does not exist  and add     PATH=${PATH}: usr local bin      Close the terminal window, launch another, and verify that   usr local bin   is now in your  PATH . You should be able to type     14  Chapter 1  Getting Started  node --version     and see something like     client:LearningNode marcw$ node --version v0.10.3 client:LearningNode marcw$     Don’t worry if the version number doesn’t match what you have on your computer.     After confirming you have the  node   program installed and working, you can start writing  JavaScript.     Installation on Linux     Installing Node.js    Although many different versions of Linux probably have Node.js as a prebuilt and installable  package, I almost always roll my own on my Linux machines for full control over the process.  The installation tends to be reasonably painless, so I am not really creating much extra work  for myself.     Getting the Command-Line Compiler on Linux    To build packages from source on Linux, you first need to make sure that you have the  command-line compiler tools installed. To do this, you can type     in a terminal window. If you see something like     g++     marcw@hostname:~$ g++  g++: no input files     you have the compiler installed and will be able to build. If instead you see     marcw@hostname:~$ g++  -bash: g++: command not found     you need to figure out how to install the build tools on your version of Linux. For most versions  of Ubuntu Linux, you can use the  apt-get   tool as follows. The trick is knowing what packages  you need to install on your specific version. For Ubuntu 8, you would need to run      apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libxml2-dev autoconf2.13     Whereas for version 10, the following works:      apt-get install pentium-builder g++ libssl-dev libxml2-dev autoconf2.13      Installing Node.js  15  After this has all run to completion, you should be able to type     g++     again and have it all work.     The following instructions are what have been used on Ubuntu Linux versions for the past few  years and assume you are using  ba sh as your primary shell. Start by creating some scratch  space to download and compile from:     cd mkdir -p src scratch cd src scratch     The next step is to download and unpack the node sources. You can do this using  curl   or  wget:     curl http:  nodejs.org dist v0.10.1 node-v0.10.1.tar.gz -o node-v0.10.1.tar.gz tar xfz node-v0.10.1.tar.gz cd node-v0.10.1     Next, you run the configuration scripts to prepare for the build:     . configure     You can let it use the default   usr local   as the installation point because it’s a good location  from which to run this software. If you want to install it somewhere else, you can specify the  --prefix   switch to the configure script, as follows:     . configure --prefix = opt nodejs     The configure script should execute quickly and print out some JSON when it is done. Now you  can build the product. Type in the following command and go get yourself a coffee  or two,  depending on how fast or slow your machine is :     After the make has completed successfully  if it fails, do a Google search on the problem  because you will almost certainly not be the first to see it , you can then install the software to  your chosen prefix    usr local   if you did not choose one :     When you are done, you should be able to just enter     make     sudo make install     node --version npm --version     and get output somewhat similar to     marcw@hostname:~$ node --version v0.10.1 marcw@hostname:~$ npm --version 1.1.65      16  Chapter 1  Getting Started  Running Node.js and “Hello World!”    There are two primary ways to use Node.js on your machines: by using the Node Shell or by  saving JavaScript to files and running those.     The Node Shell    The first way you will run Node.js is the Node shell, which is frequently called the  Node REPL — REPL stands for  Read-Eval-Print-Loop . It’s a great way to quickly test things in Node. If you don’t  remember exactly how a function should be used, you can just quickly use the REPL and type  in something to see what happens.     To launch the Node shell, you simply type  node   in whatever shell you are using:     The  >   is all the response you get. You can immediately start typing in some code:     client:node marcw$  node >     >  console.log "Hello World!" ; Hello World! undefined >     The first line of the output is the result of the code you just executed. In this case, you use the  Node global variable  console   and its  log   function to print out  Hello World!    See the next  chapter for more information on  console   and other globals.  The output of this statement is,  predictably,  Hello World! , which is printed for you.     The last line of the output is always the  resulting value   of the preceding statement. Every state- ment, function call, or expression has a value associated with it, which is printed out in the  Node shell for you. If there is no evaluated expression value or the called function does not  return any particular value, the special value  undefined   is returned instead.     To exit the REPL, you simply press Ctrl+D  same on Windows .     If you ever see three dots   ...   in the Node REPL, that means it is expecting more input from  you to complete the current expression, statement, or function. If you do not quite understand  why it is giving you the ellipsis, you can just type  .break    with the period  to get out of it:     >  function    { ...  }  ...  what?  ...  .break  >      Your First Web Server  17  Editing and Running JavaScript Files    The other option for running Node.js code is to simply use your favorite text editor to write  JavaScript code into a file, and then compile and run that code via the command line using the  node   command.     To demonstrate this, save the following to a file called  hello.js :      **  * Let's be sociable. *   console.log "Hello World!" ;     node hello.js     And you should see this output:     Hello World!     Now, you can execute this file from the command line with     Because you are not in the Node shell, you don’t get any information on the return values of  the code executed.     Your First Web Server    You’re ready to write something a bit more interesting now and create a little web server.  Fortunately, Node makes this task extremely easy. Enter and save the following into a file called  web.js :     var http = require "http" ;  function process_request req, res  {     var body = 'Thanks for calling!\n';    var content_length =  body.length ;    res.writeHead 200, {        'Content-Length': content_length,        'Content-Type': 'text plain'    } ;    res.end body ;  }  var s = http.createServer process_request ; s.listen 8080 ;     To run it, simply type     node web.js      18  Chapter 1  Getting Started  Your computer now has a web server running on port 8080. To test it, you can use the  command-line program  curl , which most Mac and Linux machines have pre-installed.  Windows users, see “Downloading from the Web on Windows.” You also can just type  http:  localhost:8080   into a web browser, but you won’t see the response codes there  unless you open a debug console.      curl -i http:  localhost:8080     You should now see something similar to the following:     HTTP 1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 20 Content-Type: text plain Date: Tue, 15 Feb 2013 03:05:08 GMT Connection: keep-alive  Thanks for calling!     Downloading from the Web on Windows    By default, Windows does not ship with any command-line utilities to get the contents of a URL.  Because it’s such a useful thing to do, I highly recommend you download cURL  I just refer to it  as  curl   from now on  or  wget   for Windows.     Curl:    You can download the Windows binaries for  curl   by visiting  http:  curl.haxx.se download.html    and looking there for the “Win32 - Generic” section.    Download one of the highlighted binaries, preferably one with support for SSL and SSH  if it  redirects you to another page, download the binary “Download WITH SUPPORT SSL” , unpack  it, and put  curl.exe   somewhere in your  PATH   or user directory. To launch it, in the command  prompt or PowerShell, just type     C:\Users\Mark\curl --help     Wget:    If you cannot get  curl   working on your Windows machine,  wget   is a great alternative. You can  download it from  http:  users.ugent.be ~bpuype wget  .    It works basically the same as  curl , but with some slightly different command-line arguments.  To learn more, view the help:     C:\Users\Mark\wget  --help     Node.js provides a lot of powerful functionality right out of the box, and in the first line of the  preceding program, you use one of these built-in modules—the  http   module, which allows your  program to act as a web server. The  require   function includes this module, and you have the  variable  http   refer to it.      Debugging Your Node.js Programs  19  The  createServer   function takes only one argument, and that is a function that will be  called whenever somebody makes a connection to your server. You pass the  process_request function you wrote earlier, which is given an object representing the incoming request  a  ServerRequest   object  and another for the pending response  of type  ServerResponse  .  When the server is created, you tell it to start listening for incoming requests on a particular  port—here, you use 8080—when you launch the program.     The  –i   switch you passed to  curl   earlier tells it to print out the headers along with the  response. This lets you learn a little bit more about what exactly Node is doing for you.     You can see that the  200  OK    response you passed to the  ServerResponsewriteHead   func- tion is returned in the HTTP response headers, and you also see the content length and types  are both represented. Node.js, by default, also indicates that HTTP connections to its server are  keep-alive , which allows multiple requests on the same network connection; you don’t need  it for most of the examples early in this book.     To stop the server from running, you simply press Ctrl+C. It is smart enough to clean up every- thing and shut down properly.     Debugging Your Node.js Programs    Now you can rewrite the preceding web server, but this time get a little careless and introduce  a smelling pistake—misspell  body.length , as follows—and put it into a file called  debugging. js :     var http = require "http" ; function process_request req, res  {     var body = 'Thanks for calling!\n';    var content_length =  body.lenggth ;    res.writeHead 200, {        'Content-Length': content_length,        'Content-Type': 'text plain'    } ;    res.end body ;  }  var s = http.createServer process_request ; s.listen 8080 ;     You can run this program as before:     node debugging.js     client:~ marcw$  curl -i localhost:8080  HTTP 1.1 200 OK Content-Length: undefined  Now, when you connect to http:  localhost:8080, you’ll probably see something like this:      20  Chapter 1  Getting Started  Content-Type: text plain Date: Tue, 30 Oct 2012 04:42:44 GMT Connection: keep-alive     You no longer get the  "Thanks for calling!"   message, and you can see that the  Content-Length   header is not what you expected.     For a trivial program like this, the error is pretty easy to figure out, but in a bigger program,  it can be hard to figure these things out. To help with this issue, Node.js includes a debug- ger right in the  node   program. To use it, you just add the  debug   flag before the name of your  program:     node debug debugging.js     You should see something like the following:     client:Chapter01 marcw$  node debug debugging.js < debugger listening on port 5858 connecting... ok break in debugging.js:1   1 var http = require "http" ;  2  3 function process_request req, res  {  debug>     You use a few key commands in the Node debugger:        cont   —Continue running.        next   —Step over the next statement.                                step   —Step into the next statement  if possible; otherwise, just step over .        out   —Step out of the current executing function.        backtrace   —Show me the current call execution frame or call stack.        repl   —Start the Node REPL to allow you to view variable values and execute code.        watch expr    —Add the given expression to the watch list, which is shown whenever you   step or move through anything in the debugger.        list    n       —List the  n   lines of source code before and after the currently stopped line in   the debugger.     Now, suspecting something might be wrong with the  Content-Length   in the program, you  can put a breakpoint on the line  var content_length = body.lenggth; , or line 5:     debug>  setBreakpoint 5     1  var   http = require "http" ;  2  3 function process_request req, res  {  4     var body = 'Thanks for calling!\n';   Debugging Your Node.js Programs  21  * 5     var content_length = body.lenggth;   6     res.writeHead 200, {  debug>     Line 5 now has a  *   next to it to indicate there is a breakpoint. When you start the debug- ger, the program is stopped at the first line. You can resume execution by using the  cont command:     debug>  cont debug>     Now, you go to another terminal window or command prompt and type     curl –i http:  localhost:8080     You should immediately notice two things:       1.     The  curl   does not return right away.       2.     In your  node debug   session, you now see     break in debugging.js:5   3 function process_request req, res  {  4     var body = 'Thanks for calling!\n';  * 5      var   content_length = body.lenggth;   6     res.writeHead 200, {  7         'Content-Length': content_length,     You can skip over this line:     debug>  next  break in debugging.js:7 * 5     var content_length = body.lenggth;   6     res.writeHead 200, {  7         'Content-Length':  content_length ,  8         'Content-Type': 'text plain'  9     } ;     And now start the Node REPL so you can examine some variable values:     Let’s look at the values of  body   and  content_length , respectively:     debug>  repl  Press Ctrl + C to leave debug repl >     >  body  'Thanks for calling!\n' >  content_length  >      22  Chapter 1  Getting Started  For  body , you can see, as expected, that you get a value. But for  content_length , which you  expect to be  20 , you see nothing. You now can see that the code that set its value is wrong and  have found the problem!     Finally, you can either just shut down the whole system by pressing Ctrl+D to end the debug- ger or you can type  cont   to continue running the server. Typing  cont   inside the REPL will not  work and results in the following error: ‘ReferenceError: cont is not defined’. You will need to  press Ctrl+C to exit the REPL first, and then you can use  cont .     Although this introduction to the debugger has been quite brief, it is worth playing around  with; it is quite powerful and very useful. There are, additionally, some other browser-based  debuggers being written by Node.js community members, the most promising of which so far is  node-inspector . Feel free to search for them and play around with them to see how they can  help you.     In a pinch, there is nothing wrong with inserting a simple  console.log variable_name ; into your code to have the results printed to the terminal window. It can often be a quick and  simple way to get the information you need to track down bugs or problems.     Staying Up-to-Date and Finding Help    As mentioned previously, one of the challenges of working with Node.js is its constant state  of change. Although more and more APIs and sections of the product are considered  Stable   or  Locked , some things are still changing with every new release, and these releases are happening  on a weekly basis.     Here are some things you can do to keep up-to-date and not miss out on any important  changes or news:                 Join the Node.js mailing list at  http:  groups.google.com group nodejs . Many of the core   Node developers are on this list and post whenever a new release or change is made.        If you are on Twitter, follow  @nodejs   there; you will receive tweets whenever there is a   new release or whenever something else important comes along.        Visit nodejs.org on a semiregular basis to make sure you are not falling too far behind.     For help, the nodejs Google group is, of course, invaluable, as is the nodejs.org website.  Similarly, StackOverflow.com has a very active community helping out with Node-related ques- tions, and you can find many good answers there.     However, I have found that a vast majority of problems are best answered with a simple Google  search. Somebody somewhere has very likely run into the same problem as you and written a  blog post or message about it. It is quite rare that I am unable to find the answers with simple  searches.      Summary  23  Summary    You should now have Node.js installed on your computer, have verified that it is working prop- erly, and have even run and debugged a few problems. Now it’s time to take a closer look at the  JavaScript language.      This page intentionally left blank    2  A Closer Look at JavaScript     Chances are, if you are reading this book, you have worked with JavaScript in the past.   Perhaps you have worked on or written a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,  and you have written some code to make the client more dynamic and interactive, either  directly by manipulating the browser Document Object Model  DOM  or by using a framework  such as jQuery or Prototype to hide some of the messier details for you. You might have even  found working with JavaScript a reasonably frustrating experience, spent a lot of time fighting  the different browsers’ incompatibilities, and it is   also quite possible that you have never  really studied the JavaScript language apart from the most basic of language features, looking things  up on the fly as you go.     The good news is that modern web browsers are slowly driving a much-needed cleanup of the  JavaScript language. Additionally, ECMAScript, which is the specification on which modern  implementations are based, is also evolving. The Chrome V8 JavaScript engine itself is also  improving and cleaning up many frustrating things about the language and adding important  features that are missing and need updating.     So, even if you’ve already played around with JavaScript in the past, it is probably worth your  while to read through this chapter fully and learn about some of the details you might have  overlooked or about some of the new features or those changed by V8 and Node.js. Although  most of the discussion in this chapter is applicable to standard JavaScript, sometimes I show  you something new and improved in Google’s V8. For such nonstandard features, I mark them  with   V8 JS  .     Types    This section begins the review of JavaScript by looking at the types the language offers. For  much of the discussion in this chapter, I use the Node.js  Read-Eval-Print-Loop    REPL  to demon- strate how the code works. To help you out, I use  bold   to indicate things that you type into the  interpreter.     client:LearningNode marcw$  node >   26  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  Type Basics    Node.js has a few core types:  number ,  boolean ,  string , and  object . The two other types,  function   and  array , are actually special kinds of  object s, but because they have extra  features in the language and runtime, some people refer to these three— object ,  function ,  and  array —as  complex types . The types  null   and  undefined   are also special kinds of  object s  and are also treated specially in JavaScript.     The value  undefined   means that a value has not been set yet or simply does not exist:     >  var x; undefined >  x = {};  {} >  x.not_valid; undefined >     >  var y; undefined >  y undefined >  y = null ; null >  null , on the other hand, is an explicit assertion that there “is no value”:     To see the type of anything in JavaScript, you use the  typeof   operator:     >  typeof 10  'number' >  typeof "hello";  'string' >  typeof function    { var x = 20; } 'function' >     Constants    While Node.js theoretically supports the  const   keyword extension that some modern  JavaScript implementations have implemented, it’s still not widely used. For constants, the  standard practice is still to just use uppercase letters and variable declarations:     >  var SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400; undefined >  console.log SECONDS_PER_DAY ; 86400 undefined >   Types  27  Numbers    All numbers in JavaScript are 64-bit IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point numbers. For all  positive and negative integers that can be expressed in 2 53   bits accurately, the number type in  JavaScript behaves much like integer data types in other languages:     >  1024 * 1024  1048576 >  1048576  1048576 >  32437893250 + 3824598359235235 3824630797128485 >  -38423538295 + 35892583295 -2530955000 >     >  0.1 + 0. 2 0.30000000000000004 >     >  1 - 0.3 + 0.1 == 0.8 false >     The tricky part of using the number type, however, is that for many numeric values, it is an  approximation   of the actual number. For example:     When performing floating-point mathematical operations, you cannot just manipulate arbi- trary real numbers and expect an exact value:     For these cases, you instead need to check if the value is in some sort of approximate range, the  size of which is defined by the magnitude of the values you are comparing.  Search the website  stackoverflow.com   for articles and questions on comparing floating-point numbers for good  ideas of strategies on this.      For those situations in which you absolutely need to represent 64-bit integer values in  JavaScript without any chance of approximation errors, you are either stuck using the  string type and manipulating these numbers by hand, or you can use one of the available modules for  manipulating big integer values.     JavaScript is a bit different from other languages in that dividing a number by zero returns the  value  Infinity   or  -Infinity   instead of generating a runtime exception:     >  5   0 Infinity >  -5   0 -Infinity >      If you provide these functions with something that cannot be parsed, they return the special  value  NaN    not-a-number :     28  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  Infinity   and  -Infinity   are valid values that you can compare against in JavaScript:     You can use the functions  parseInt   and  parseFloat   to convert strings to numbers:     >  var x = 10, y = 0; undefined >  x   y == Infinity true >     >  parseInt "32523523626263" ; 32523523626263 >  parseFloat "82959.248945895" ; 82959.248945895 >  parseInt "234.43634" ;  234 >  parseFloat "10" ;  10 >     >  parseInt "cat" ;  NaN >  parseFloat "Wankel-Rotary engine" ; NaN >     To test for NaN, you must use the isNaN function:     >  isNaN parseInt "cat"  ; true >     >  isFinite 10 5 ;  true >  isFinite 10 0 ;  false >  isFinite parseFloat "banana"  ; false >     Finally, to test whether a given number is a valid finite number  that is, it is not Infinity,  -Infinity , or  NaN  , use the  isFinite   function:     Booleans    The  boolean   type in JavaScript is both simple and simple to use. Values can either be true or false, and although you technically can convert values to  boolean   with the  Boolean      Types  29  function, you almost never need it because the language converts everything to  boolean   when  needed, according to the following rules:       1.     false ,  0 , empty strings   ""  ,  NaN ,  null , and  undefined   all evaluate to  false .       2.     All other values evaluate to  true .     Strings    Strings in JavaScript are sequences of Unicode characters  represented internally in a 16-bit  UCS-2   format  that can represent a vast majority of the characters in the world, including those  used in most Asian languages. There is no separate  char   or character data type in the language;  you just use a string of length  1   to represent these. For most of the network applications you’ll  be writing with Node.js, you will interact with the outside world in  UTF- 8, and Node will  handle all the details of conversion for you. Except for when you are manipulating binary data,  your experience with strings and character sets   will largely be worry-free.     Strings can be wrapped in single or double quotation marks. They are functionally equivalent,  and you are free to use whatever ones you want. To include a single quotation mark inside a  single-quoted string, you can use  \' , and similarly for double quotation marks inside double- quoted strings, you can use  \" :     To get the length of a string in JavaScript, just use the  length   property:     >  'Marc\'s hat is new.'  'Marc\'s hat is new.' >  "\"Hey, nice hat!\", she said."

The good news is that almost all modern browser implementations of JavaScript— including Chrome’s V8 that you use in Node.js—have optimized this scenario heavily, and  performance is now quite good.     String Functions    Many interesting functions are available to strings in JavaScript. To find a string with another  string, use the  indexOf   function:     >  "Wishy washy winter".indexOf "wash" ; 6 >     To extract a substring from a string, use the  substr   or  splice   function.  The former takes the  starting index and length of string to extract; the latter takes the starting index and ending  index :      Types  31  >  "No, they're saying Booo-urns.".substr 19, 3 ; 'Boo' >  "No, they're saying Booo-urns.".slice 19, 22 ; 'Boo' >     If you have a string with some sort of separator character in it, you can split that up into  component strings by using the split function and get an  array   as the result:     >  "abcdefgh".split "" ; [ 'a',  'b',  'c',  'd',  'e',  'f',  'g',  'h' ]  >     >  '       cat   \n\n\n    '. trim  ; 'cat' >     Finally, the  trim   function   V8 JS    does exactly what you would expect—removes whitespace  from the beginning and end of a string:     Regular Expressions    JavaScript has powerful regular expression support, the full details of which are beyond the  scope of this book, but I briefly show how and where you can use them. A certain number of  string functions can take arguments that are regular expressions to perform their work. These  regular expressions can either be entered in  literal format    indicated by putting the regular  expression between two forward slash [   ] characters  or as a call to the constructor of a  RegExp object:      [aA]{2,}  new RegExp "[Aa]{2,}"      Both of these are regular expressions that match against a sequence of two or more of the letter  a    upper- or lowercase .     To replace all sequences of two or more  a’ s with the letter  b   on  string   objects, you can use the  replace   function and write either of the following:     >  "aaoo".replace new RegExp "[Aa]{2,}" , "b" ; 'boo' >  "aaoo".replace  [Aa]{2,} , "b" ;  'boo' >      32  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  Similar to the  indexOf   function, the  search   function takes a regular expression and returns  the index of the first match against it, or  -1   if no such match exists:     >  "aaoo".search  [Aa]{2,}  ; 0 >  "aoo".search  [Aa]{2,}  ; -1 >     >  var o1 = new Object  ; undefined >  var o2 = {}; undefined >     var user = {     first_name: "marc",    last_name: "wandschneider",    age: Infinity,    citizenship: "man of the world"  };     Objects    Objects are one of the core workhorses of the JavaScript language, and something you will  use all the time. They are an extremely dynamic and flexible data type, and you can add and  remove things from them with ease. To create an object, you can use either of the following,  although the latter, known as  object literal syntax , is almost always preferred nowadays:     You can also specify the contents of objects using object literal syntax, where you can specify  member names and values at initialization time:     About JSON    One of the things used quite often in this book  and indeed in all the network and web applica- tions  is JSON, or  JavaScript Object Notation . This data exchange format gives you all the flex- ibility of a text-based data format, without the hassle that some of the other formats such as  XML bring.  To be fair to the latter, JSON does lack some of the validation features of those  formats as well, but I still find it infinitely preferable to use.     JSON is extremely similar to object literal notation with two key differences: Whereas, in object  literal notation, wrapping the property names in single or double quotation marks is optional, in  JSON it is  mandatory.   Furthermore, all strings should be double-quoted as follows:        valid object literal notation, INVALID JSON:  var obj = {        JSON strings are supposed to use ", not '     "first_name": 'Marc',   Types  33        Must wrap property names for JSON     last_name: "Wandschneider"     valid JSON and object literal notation:  var obj = {     "first_name": "Marc",     "last_name": "Wandschneider"  }  }     A nontrivial number of JSON libraries actually accept single-quoted strings, but to be maximally  compatible, you should be careful to use double quotation marks whenever you write or gener- ate JSON.    To generate JSON, you mostly use the V8 functions  JSON.parse   and  JSON.stringify . The  former takes a JSON string and converts it to an object  or throws an error if it fails , while the  latter takes an object and returns a JSON string representation of it.    When you are writing objects in code, you mostly use object literal notation, but you also work  with a lot of JSON in this book as well, so it is important to recognize the difference. I point out  whenever JSON is absolutely required.     You can add a new property to your user object by using any of the following methods:     >  user.hair_colour = "brown"; 'brown' >  user["hair_colour"] = "brown"; 'brown' >  var attribute = 'hair_colour'; undefined >  user[attribute] = "brown"; 'brown' >  user  { first_name: 'marc',   last_name: 'wandschneider',  age: Infinity,  citizenship: 'man of the world',  hair_colour: 'brown' }  >  >  user.car_make undefined >     If you try to access a property that does not exist, you do not receive an error, but instead just  get back  undefined :      34  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  To remove a property from an object, you can use the  delete   keyword:     >  delete user.hair_colour; true >  user  { first_name: 'marc',   last_name: 'wandschneider',  age: Infinity,  citizenship: 'man of the world' }  >     The flexibility of objects in JavaScript makes them quite similar to various associative arrays,  hash maps, or dictionaries seen in other languages, but there is an interesting difference:  Getting the size of an object-as-associative-array in JavaScript is a bit tricky. There are no  size or  length   properties or methods on  Object . To get around this, you can write the following   V8 JS  :     >  Object.keys user .length; 4     Note that this uses a nonstandard extension to JavaScript  Object.keys ; although V8 and most  browsers  except Internet Explorer  already support it.     Arrays    The  array   type in JavaScript is actually a special casing of the  object   type, with a number of  additional features that make them useful and powerful. To create arrays, you can either use  traditional notation or  array literal syntax :     >  var arr1 = new Array  ; undefined >  arr1  [] >  var arr2 = []; undefined >  arr2  [] >     >  typeof arr2 'object' >     As with objects, I almost always prefer the literal syntax version, and rarely use the former.     If you use the  typeof   operator on arrays, you get a surprising result:      Because arrays are actually objects, the  typeof   operator just returns that, which is very  frequently not what you want! Fortunately, V8 has a language extension to let you test deter- minatively whether or not something is an array: the  Array.isArray   function   V8 JS  :     Types  35  One of the key features of the  array   type in JavaScript is the  length   property, used as follows:     >  Array.isArray arr2 ; true >  Array.isArray {} ; false >     >  arr2.length  0 >  var arr3 = [ 'cat', 'rat', 'bat' ]; undefined >  arr3.length;  3 >     By default, arrays in JavaScript are numerically indexed:        this: for  var i = 0; i < arr3.length; i++  {     console.log arr3[i] ;  }    will print out this: cat rat bat     >  arr3.push "mat" ;  4 >  arr3  [ 'cat',  'rat',  'bat',  'mat' ] >  arr3[arr3.length] = "fat";  'fat' >  arr3  [ 'cat',  'rat',  'bat',  'mat',  'fat' ] >     To add an item to the end of an array, you can do one of two things:     You can specify the index of the element where you want to insert a new element. If this  element is past the last element, the elements in between are created and initialized with the  value  undefined :      36  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  >  arr3[20] = "splat";  'splat' >  arr3  [ 'cat', 'rat', 'bat', 'mat', 'fat', , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 'splat' ] >     To remove elements from an array, you might try to use the  delete   keyword again, but the  results may surprise you:     >  delete arr3[2];   true  >  arr3   [ 'cat', 'rat', , 'mat', 'fat', , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 'splat' ] >     You see that the value at index 2 still “exists” and has just been set to  undefined .     To truly delete an item from an array, you probably should use the  splice   function, which  takes an index and the number of items to delete. What it returns is an array with the extracted  items, and the original array is modified such that they no longer exist there:     >  arr3.splice 2, 2 ;  [  , 'mat' ] > arr3  [ 'cat', 'rat', 'fat', , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 'splat' ] >  arr3.length  19     Useful Functions    There are a few key functions you frequently use with arrays. The  push   and  pop   functions let  you add and remove items to the end of an array, respectively:     >  var nums = [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ]; undefined >  nums.push 13 ;  7 >  nums  [ 1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  8,  13 ] > nums.pop  ;  13 >  nums  [ 1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  8 ] >      To insert or delete items from the front of an array, use  unshift   or  shift , respectively:     Types  37  >  var nums = [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ]; undefined >  nums.unshift 1 ;  6 >  nums  [ 1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  8 ] >  nums.shift  ;  1 >  nums  [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ] >     >  var nums = [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ]; undefined >  nums.join ", " ;  '1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8' >     The opposite of the string function  split   seen previously is the array function  join , which  returns a string:     You can sort arrays using the  sort   function, which can be used with the built-in sorting  function:     >  var jumble_nums = [ 3, 1, 8, 5, 2, 1]; undefined >  jumble_nums.sort  ;  [ 1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  8 ] >     For those cases where it doesn’t quite do what you want, you can provide your own sorting  function as a parameter:     >  var names = [ 'marc', 'Maria', 'John', 'jerry', 'alfred', 'Moonbeam']; undefined >  names.sort  ;  [ 'John',  'Maria',  'Moonbeam',  'alfred',  'jerry',  'marc' ] >  names.sort function  a, b  {           var a1 = a.toLowerCase  , b1 = b.toLowerCase  ;          if  a1 < b1  return -1;          if  a1 > b1  return 1;          return 0;      } ;   [ 'alfred',  'jerry',  'John',  'marc',  'Maria',  'Moonbeam' ] >      38  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  To iterate over items in arrays, you have a number of options, including the  for   loop shown  previously, or you can use the  forEach   function   V8 JS  , as follows:     [ 'marc', 'Maria', 'John', 'jerry', 'alfred', 'Moonbeam'].forEach  function    value  {     console.log value ;  Type Comparisons and Conversions    As alluded to previously, for the most part, types in JavaScript behave as you would expect  them and as you have seen in other programming languages. JavaScript has both the equality  operator  ==    do the two operands have the same value?  and the precise equality operator  ===  do the two operands have the same value and are of the same type? :     } ; marc Maria John jerry alfred Moonbeam     >  234 == '234'  true >  234 === '234'  false >  234234.235235 == 'cat'  false >  "cat" == "CAT"  false >  "cat".toUpperCase   == "CAT"; true     >  '' == false == null == undefined == 0 true >  null === undefined  false >     You also saw that a number of different things evaluate to  false , despite being quite different:     This saves you some time when doing tasks such as checking arguments to functions:     function fine param  {     if  param == null  param == undefined  param == ''        throw new Error "Invalid Argument" ;  }   Functions  39  function better param  {    if  !param  throw new Error "Invalid Argument" ;  }     One case where type comparisons can be tricky is if you use object constructors for values  instead of just using primitives:     >  var x = 234;  undefined >  var x1 = new Number 234 ; undefined >  typeof x 1 'object' >  typeof x  'number' >  x1 == x  true >  x1 === x  false >     The object constructors are functionally equivalent to the primitive types; all the same opera- tions, operators, and functions produce the same results, but the precise equality operator  === and  typeof   operator produce different results. For this reason, it is recommended to just use  the primitive types whenever possible.     Functions    Although it does not look like it at first glance  the name doesn’t help either , JavaScript is a  functional   programming language, wherein functions are fully typed objects that can be manip- ulated, extended, and passed around as data. Node.js takes advantage of this capability, and  you will use it extensively in your network and web applications.     Basics    The simplest kind of function is exactly as you would expect:     function hello name  {     console.log "hello " + name ;  } >  hello "marc" ;  hello marc undefined >      To declare parameters for a function in JavaScript, you simply list them in the parentheses.  There is, however, absolutely no checking of these parameters at runtime:     40  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  >  hello  ;  hello undefined undefined >  hello "marc", "dog", "cat", 48295 ; hello marc undefined >     If too few parameters are passed into a function call, the resulting variables are assigned the  value  undefined . If too many are passed in, the extras are simply unused.     All functions have a predefined array in the body called  arguments . It has all the values that  were passed in to this particular function call, and lets you do extra checking on the parameter  list. Indeed, you can go a step further and use it to make your functions more powerful and  flexible.     Suppose you want to initialize a caching subsystem you wrote. The function to do this takes a  size to create the cache and uses default values for other things such as cache location, expira- tion algorithm, maximum cache item size, and storage type. You could write the function as  follows:     function init_cache size_mb, location, algorithm, item_size, storage_type  {  However, it would be even cooler if you could have the function be “smart” enough to give  you a couple of different ways to call it:        ...  }  init_cache 100, null, null, null, null ;     function init_cache   {     var init_data = {        cache_size: 10,        location: ' tmp',        algorithm: 'lru',        item_size: 1024,        storage_type: 'btree'    };        var a = arguments;    for  var i = 0; i < a.length; i++  {        if  typeof a[i] == 'object'  {            init_data = a[i];            break;        } else if  typeof a[i] == 'number'  {            init_data.cache_size = a[i];   Functions  41             break;        } else {            throw new Error "bad cache init param" ;        }    }        etc  }     Now you have a number of different ways you can call this function:     init_cache  ; init_cache 200 ; init_cache { cache_size: 100,              location: ' exports dfs tmp',             algorithm: 'lruext',             item_size: 1024,             storage_type: 'btree'}  ;     Functions in JavaScript do not even need to have names:     var x = function  a, b  {       return a + b;  }  >  x 10, 20 ;  30     var x = function    {       throw new Error "whoopsie" ;  }   >  x  ;  Error: whoopsie     at x  repl:2:7     at repl:1:1    at REPLServer.self.eval  repl.js:109:21     at rli.on.self.bufferedCmd  repl.js:258:20      These nameless functions are typically called  anonymous functions . There is one drawback to  fully anonymous functions and that comes in debugging:     Anonymous functions do not permit the language engine to tell you what the name of the  function is when an exception is thrown. This can make your life a bit more difficult when  debugging.     A simple solution and modern extension to the JavaScript language is to simply name the  anonymous functions:      42  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  var x = function bad_apple   {       throw new Error "whoopsie" ;  }   >  x  ;  Error: whoopsie     at  bad_apple    repl:2:7     at repl:1:1    at REPLServer.self.eval  repl.js:109:21     at rli.on.self.bufferedCmd  repl.js:258:20      In complicated programs, having an exact pointer to the location of an error can be a real life- saver. For this reason, some people choose to name all their anonymous functions.     You have already seen an example of anonymous functions in the earlier section “Arrays”  when you called the  sort   function with an anonymous function to do case-insensitive string  comparisons. You use many more of them throughout this book.     Function Scope    Every time a function is called, a new variable scope is created. Variables declared in the parent  scope are available to that function, but variables declared within the new scope are not avail- able when the function exits. Consider the following code:     var pet = 'cat';  function play_with_pets   {     var pet = 'dog';    console.log pet ;  play_with_pets  ; console.log pet ;     It outputs the following:     }  dog cat     var height = 5; var radius = 3; var volume;  Combining this scoping with anonymous functions can be a good way to do some quick or  private work with private variables that will disappear when the anonymous function exits.  Here’s a contrived example to compute the volume of a cone:      Language Constructs  43     declare and immediately call anon function to create scope  function    {     var pir2 = Math.PI * radius * radius;      temp var    volume =  pir2 * height    3;  }   ;  console.log volume ;     You will see a number of other common patterns involving functions when you move into  Chapter    3   , “Asynchronous Programming.”     Language Constructs    JavaScript contains nearly all the language operators and constructs you would expect, includ- ing most logical and mathematical operators.     The ternary operator is supported:     var pet = animal_meows ? "cat" : "dog";     Even though numbers are implemented as double-precision floating-point numbers, bitwise  operations  are   supported in JavaScript: The  &     and  ,       or  ,  ~     inverse  , and  ^     xor   operators all  work by:        First converting the operands into 32-bit integers.        Performing the bitwise operation.     1.  2.  3.     Finally, converting the resulting number back to a JavaScript number.     In addition to the standard  while ,  do...while , and  for   loops, JavaScript also supports the  new language extensions  for   loop called the  for...in   loop   V8 JS .   This loop is used to get  the names of all the keys on an object:     var user = {     first_name: "marc",    last_name: "wandschneider",    age: Infinity,    occupation: "writer"  };  }  for  key in user  {     console.log key ;   44  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  first_name last_name age occupation undefined >     Classes, Prototypes, and Inheritance    Object-oriented programming in JavaScript is a bit different from other languages in that there  is no explicit class keyword or type. Indeed, classes are all declared as functions:     function Shape    {     this.X = 0;    this.Y = 0;     this.move = function  x, y  {        this.X = x;        this.Y = y;    }    this.distance_from_origin = function    {        return Math.sqrt this.X*this.X + this.Y*this.Y ;    }  }  var s = new Shape  ; s.move 10, 10 ; console.log s.distance_from_origin   ;     The preceding program generates the following output:     14.142135623730951     You can add as many properties and methods to your classes as you like, at any time:     var s = new Shape 15, 35 ; s.FillColour = "red";     The function that declares the class also servers as its constructor!     There are two problems with this scheme for creating classes, however. First, it seems a bit inef- ficient to have to carry around the method implementations with every single object.  Every  time you create a new instance of  Shape , you are creating the  move   and  distance_from_ origin   functions from scratch.  Second, you might like to extend this class to create circles and  squares and have them inherit the methods and properties from the base class without your  having to do any extra work.      Classes, Prototypes, and Inheritance  45  Prototypes and Inheritance    By default, all objects in JavaScript have a  prototype   object, which is the mechanism through  which they inherit properties and methods. Prototypes have been the source of much confu- sion in JavaScript over the years, often because different browsers use different nomencla- ture for it and subtly different implementations. Because it is relevant to the interests of  this chapter, I demonstrate the model that V8  and thus Node  uses and that other modern  JavaScript implementations seem to be moving toward.     Change the  Shape   class created earlier so that all inheriting objects also get the  X   and  Y   proper- ties, as well as the methods you have declared on it:     function Shape    { }  Shape.prototype.X = 0; Shape.prototype.Y = 0;  Shape.prototype.move = function  x, y  {     this.X = x;    this.Y = y;  } Shape.prototype.distance_from_origin = function    {    return Math.sqrt this.X*this.X + this.Y*this.Y ;  } Shape.prototype.area = function    {     throw new Error "I don't have a form yet" ;  } var s = new Shape  ; s.move 10, 10 ; console.log s.distance_from_origin   ;     Run this script and you get the same output as the previous one. Indeed, functionally, apart  from potentially being slightly more memory efficient  if you created lots of instances, they  would all share the implementations of  move   and  distance_from_origin   instead of carrying  around their own , it is not that different. You have added a method  area   that all shapes will  have. On the base class, it does not make much sense, so you just have it throw an error.     More importantly, you have set yourself up to extend it quite easily:     function Square   { }  Square.prototype = new Shape  ; Square.prototype.__proto__ = Shape.prototype; Square.prototype.Width = 0;   The code for this new  Square   class makes use of a new JavaScript language feature seen in V8  and a few other implementations: the  __proto__   property. It lets you tell JavaScript that a new  class you are declaring should have the base prototype of the specified type, and then you can  extend it from there.     You can further extend things with a new class called  Rectangle , inheriting from the  Square class:     46  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  Square.prototype.area = function    {     return this.Width * this.Width;  var sq = new Square  ; sq.move -5, -5 ; sq.Width = 5; console.log sq.area   ; console.log sq.distance_from_origin   ;     }  }  function Rectangle    { }  Rectangle.prototype = new Square  ; Rectangle.prototype.__proto__ = Square.prototype; Rectangle.prototype.Height = 0;  Rectangle.prototype.area = function    {     return this.Width * this.Height;  var re = new Rectangle  ; re.move 25, 25 ; re.Width = 10; re.Height = 5; console.log re.area   ; console.log re.distance_from_origin   ;     console.log sq instanceof Square ;         true console.log sq instanceof Shape ;          true console.log sq instanceof Rectangle ;      false console.log re instanceof Rectangle ;      true console.log sq instanceof Square ;         true console.log sq instanceof Shape ;          true console.log sq instanceof Date ;           false     To convince yourself that things are going smoothly, you can use an operator you have not  seen before,  instanceof :      Some Important Node.js Globals  47  Errors and Exceptions    In JavaScript, you traditionally signal errors using an  Error   object and a message. You  throw this error, to signal the error condition:     function uhoh    {       throw new Error "Something bad happened!" ;  }   }  }  >  uhoh  ;  Error: Something bad happened!     at uhoh  repl:2:7     at repl:1:1    at REPLServer.self.eval  repl.js:109:21     at rli.on.self.bufferedCmd  repl.js:258:20      You can  catch   it with a t ry   catch   block as seen in other languages:     function uhoh    {     throw new Error "Something bad happened!" ;  try {     uhoh  ;  } catch  e  {     console.log "I caught an error: " + e.message ;  console.log "program is still running" ;     The output of this program is     I caught an error: Something bad happened! program is still running     As you see in the next chapter, however, this method of error handling does create some prob- lems with the asynchronous model of programming you will be using in Node.js.     Some Important Node.js Globals    Node.js has a few key global variables that are always available to you.     global    When you write JavaScript in web browsers, you have the  window   object, which acts as a  “global” variable. Any variables or members you attach to it are available anywhere in your  application.      48  Chapter 2  A Closer Look at JavaScript  Node.js has something similar, called the  global   object. Anything attached to it is available  anywhere in your node application:     function printit var_name  {     console.log global[var_name] ;  global.fish = "swordfish"; global.pet = "cat";  printit "fish" ;     prints swordfish printit "pet" ;       prints cat printit "fruit" ;    prints undefined     }           console    You have already seen the global variable  console   in Node, as you frequently use the  console.log   function. There are a few other interesting functions, however:        warn    msg     —This function is similar to  log , but it prints on  stderr .        time    label       and  timeEnd     label     —The first marks a time stamp, and when you call   the second, it prints out the elapsed time since the time function was called.        assert    cond   ,     message      —If  cond   evaluates to  false , throw an  AssertionFailure  exception.     process    The other key global in Node is the  process   global variable, which contains a lot of informa- tion and methods that you will see as you work through this book. The  exit   method is one  way to terminate your Node.js programs, the  env   function returns an object with current user  environment variables, and  cwd   returns the current working directory of the app.     Summary    You took a quick look at the JavaScript language in this chapter, and I hope your knowledge  of the language has at least been sharpened a little bit, with some confusing or unknown areas  clarified a bit. With this basic knowledge under your belt, you can now begin to look at how  Node.js uses the language so effectively to create powerful and speedy applications.      3  Asynchronous Programming     Now that you have a refreshed and updated idea of what JavaScript programming is really   like, it’s time to get into the core concept that makes Node.js what it is: that of  nonblocking IO  and asynchronous programming . It carries with it some huge advantages and benefits, which you  shall soon see, but it also brings some complications and challenges with it.     The Old Way of Doing Things    In the olden days  2008 or so , when you sat down to write an application and needed to load  in a file, you would write something like the following  let’s assume you’re using something  vaguely PHP-ish for example purposes :     $file = fopen 'info.txt', 'r' ;    wait until file is open  $contents = fread $file, 100000 ;    wait until contents are read     do something with those contents     If you were to analyze the execution of this script, you would find that it spends a vast major- ity of its time  doing nothing at all . Indeed, most of the clock time taken by this script is spent  waiting for the computer’s file system to do its job and return the file contents you requested.  Let me generalize things a step further and state that for most IO-based applications—those  that frequently connect to databases, communicate with external servers, or read and write  files—your scripts will spend a majority of their time sitting around waiting  see  Figure    3.1    .      The way your server computers process multiple requests at the same time is by running many  of these scripts in parallel. Modern computer operating systems are great at multitasking, so  you can easily switch out processes that are blocked and let other processes have access to the  CPU. Some environments take things a step further and use threads instead of processes.      50  Chapter 3  Asynchronous Programming  Figure 3.1      Traditional blocking IO web servers     The problem is that for each of these processes or threads is that there is some amount of  overhead. For heavier implementations using Apache and PHP, I have seen up to 10–15MB  per-process memory overhead in the past—never mind the resources and time consumed by  the operating system switching that context in and out constantly. That’s not even 100 simul- taneously executing servers per gigabyte of RAM! Threaded solutions and those using more  lightweight HTTP servers do, of course, have better results, but you still end up in a situation in  which the computer spends most of its time waiting around   for blocked processes to get their  results, and you risk running out of capacity to handle incoming requests.     It would be nice if there were some way to make better use of all the available CPU computing  power and available memory so as not to waste so much. This is where Node.js shines.     The Node.js Way of Doing Things    To understand how Node.js changes the method demonstrated in the preceding section into  a nonblocking, asynchronous model, first look at the  setTimeout   function in JavaScript. This  function takes a function to call and a timeout after which it should be called:      The Node.js Way of Doing Things  51     blah setTimeout function    {     console.log "I've done my work!" ;  }, 2000 ;  console.log "I'm waiting for all my work to finish." ;  If you run the preceding code, you see the following output:     I'm waiting for all my work to finish. I've done my work!     I hope this is not a surprise to you: The program sets the timeout for  2000ms    2s , giving it the  function to call when it fires, and then continues with execution, which prints out the “I’m  waiting...” text. Two seconds later, you see the “I’ve done...” message, and the program  then exits.     Now, look at a world where any time you call a function that needs to wait for some external  resource  database server, network request, or file system read write operation , it has a similar  signature. That is, instead of calling  fopen path, mode    and waiting, you would instead call  fopen path, mode, function callback file_handle  { ... }  .     Now rewrite the preceding synchronous script using the new asynchronous functions. You can  actually enter and run this program with  node   from the command line. Just make sure you also  create a file called info.txt that can be read.     var fs = require 'fs' ;                    this is new, see explanation  var file; var buf = new Buffer 100000 ; fs.open      'info.txt', 'r',     function    handle  {        file = handle;    }   ;   ;     fs.read                                    this will generate an error.     file, buffer, 0, 100000, null,     function      {        console.log buf.toString   ;        file.close file, function    {  * don't care *  } ;    }   52  Chapter 3  Asynchronous Programming  The first line of this code is something you haven’t seen just yet: The  require   function is a  way to include additional functionality in your Node.js programs. Node comes with a pretty  impressive set of  modules , each of which you can include separately as you need functionality.  You will work further with modules frequently from now on; you learn about consuming them  and writing your own in  Chapter    5   , “Modules.”     If you run this program as it is, it throws an error and terminates. How come? Because the  fs. open   function runs  asynchronously;   it returns immediately, before the file has been opened, and  you have the handle value returned to you. The  file   variable is not set until the file has been  opened and the handle to it has been received in the callback specified as the third parameter  to the  fs.open   function. Thus, it is still  undefined   when you try to call the  fs.read   function  with it immediately afterward.     Fixing this program is easy:     var fs = require 'fs' ;  fs.open      'info.txt', 'r',     function    err, handle  {        we'll see more about the err param in a bit        var buf = new Buffer 100000 ;        fs.read             handle, buf, 0, 100000, null,             function    err, length  {                console.log buf.toString 'utf8', 0, length  ;                fs.close handle, function    {  * don't care *  } ;            }         ;    }   ;              The key way to think of how these asynchronous functions work is something along the  following lines:        Check and validate parameters.        Tell the Node.js core to queue the call to the appropriate function for you  in the   preceding example, the operating system  open   or the  read   function , and to notify  call   the provided callback function when there is a result.        Return to the caller.     You might be asking: If the  open   function returns right away, why doesn’t the  node   process  exit immediately after that function has returned? The answer is that Node operates with an  event queue;   if there are pending events for which you are awaiting a response, it does not exit  until your code has finished executing  and   there are no events left on that queue. If you are  waiting for a response  either to the  open   or the  read   function calls , it waits. See  Figure    3.2   for  an idea of how this scenario looks conceptually.      Error Handling and Asynchronous Functions  53  Figure 3.2      As long as there is code executing or somebody is waiting for something, Node runs.     Error Handling and Asynchronous Functions    In the preceding chapter, I discussed error handling and events as well as the  try ... catch block in JavaScript. The addition of nonblocking IO and asynchronous function callbacks in  this chapter, however, creates a new problem. Consider the following code:        setTimeout function    {        throw new Error "Uh oh!" ;    }, 2000 ; } catch  e  {  try {  }        console.log "I caught the error: " + e.message ;   54  Chapter 3  Asynchronous Programming  If you run this code, you might very well expect to see the output  "I caught the error: Uh  oh!" . But you do not. You actually see the following:     timers.js:103             if  !process.listeners 'uncaughtException' .length  throw e;                                                                      ^  Error: Uh oh, something bad!     at Object._onTimeout errors_async.js:5:15     at Timer.list.ontimeout  timers.js:101:19      What happened? Did I not say that  try ... catch   blocks were supposed to catch errors for  you? I did, but asynchronous callbacks throw a new little wrench into this situation.     In reality, the call to  setTimeout    does   execute within the  try ... catch   block. If that func- tion were to throw an error, the  catch   block would catch it, and you would see the message  that you had hoped to see. However, the  setTimeout   function just adds an event to the Node  event queue  instructing it to call the provided function after the specified time interval— 2000ms in this example , and then returns. The provided callback function actually operates  within its own entirely new context and scope!     As a result, when you call asynchronous functions for nonblocking IO, very few of them throw  errors, but instead use a separate way of telling you that something has gone wrong.     In Node, you use a number of core  patterns   to help you standardize how you write code and  avoid errors. These patterns are not enforced syntactically by the language or runtime, but you  will see them used frequently and even use them yourself.     The callback Function and Error Handling    One of the first patterns you will see is the format of the  callback   function you pass to most  asynchronous functions. It always has at least one parameter, the success or failure status of the  last operation, and very commonly a second with some sort of additional results or information  from the last operation  such as a file handle, database connection, rows from a query, and so  on ; some callbacks are given even more than two:     do_something param1, param2, ..., paramN,  function  err, results    { ... } ;     The  err   parameter is either           a result.        null , indicating the operation was a success, and  if there should be one  there will be      An instance of the  Error   object class. You will occasionally notice some inconsistency  here, with some people always adding a  code   field to the  Error   object and then using  the  message   field to hold a description of what happened, whereas others have chosen  other patterns. For all the code you write in this book, you will follow the pattern  of always including a  code   field and using the  message   field to provide as much  information as you can. For all the modules you write, you will use a string value for the    Error Handling and Asynchronous Functions  55  code   because they tend to be a bit easier to read. Some libraries provide extra   data in the  Error   object with additional information, but at least the two members should always be  there.     This standard prototype methodology enables you to always write predictable code when you  are working with nonblocking functions. Throughout this book, I demonstrate two common  coding styles for handling errors in callbacks. Here’s the first:     fs.open      'info.txt', 'r',    function  err, handle  {         if  err  {              console.log "ERROR: " + err.code + "  " + err.message " " ;              return;          }            success!! continue working here    }   ;   ;  In this style, you check for errors and return if you see one; otherwise, you continue to process  the result. And now here’s the other way:     fs.open      'info.txt', 'r',    function  err, handle  {         if  err  {              console.log "ERROR: " + err.code + "  " + err.message " " ;          } else {                success! continue working here         }      }  In this method, you use an  if ... then ... else   statement to handle the error.     The difference between these two may seem like splitting hairs, but the former method is a  little more prone to bugs and errors for those cases when you forget to use the  return   state- ment inside the  if   statement, whereas the latter results in code that indents itself much more  quickly and you end up with lines of code that are quite long and less readable. You look at a  solution to this second problem in the section titled “A Module So Common It Should Be Built  In” in  Chapter    5   .      56  Chapter 3  Asynchronous Programming  A fully updated version of the file-loading code with error handling is shown in  Listing    3.1   .     Listing 3.1      File Loading with Full Error Handling     var fs = require 'fs' ;  fs.open      'info.txt', 'r',     function    err, handle  {        if  err  {            console.log "ERROR: " + err.code                        + "  " + err.message + " " ;            return;        }        var buf = new Buffer 100000 ;        fs.read             handle, buf, 0, 100000, null,             function    err, length  {                if  err  {                    console.log "ERROR: " + err.code +                                "  " + err.message + " " ;                    return;                }                console.log buf.toString 'utf8', 0, length  ;                fs.close handle, function    {  * don't care *  } ;            }         ;    }   ;     Who Am I? Maintaining a Sense of Identity    Now you’re ready to write a little class to help you with some common file operations:     var fs = require 'fs' ;  function FileObject    {      this .filename = '';      this .file_exists = function  callback  {        console.log "About to open: " + this.filename ;        fs.open this.filename, 'r',  function    err, handle  {            if  err  {                console.log "Can't open: " +  this .filename ;                callback err ;   Who Am I? Maintaining a Sense of Identity  57                 return;            }            fs.close handle, function    { } ;            callback null, true ;        } ;    };  }              You have currently added one property,  filename , and a single method,  file_exists . This  method does the following:        It tries to open this file specified in the  filename   property read-only.        If the file doesn’t exist, it prints a message and calls the callback function with the   error info.        If the file does exist, it calls the callback function indicating success.     Now, run this class with the following code:     var fo = new FileObject  ; fo.filename = "file_that_does_not_exist";  fo.file_exists  function    err, results  {     if  err  {        console.log "Aw, bummer: " + JSON.stringify err  ;        return;    }     console.log "file exists!!!" ;  } ;     You might expect the following output:     About to open: file_that_does_not_exist Can't open: file_that_does_not_exist  But, in fact, you see this:     About to open: file_that_does_not_exist Can't open: undefined     What happened? Most of the time, when you have a function nested within another, it inherits  the scope of its parent host function and should have access to all the same variables. So why  does the nested callback function not get the correct value for the  filename   property?     The problem lies with the  this   keyword and asynchronous callback functions. Don’t forget  that when you call a function like  fs.open , it initializes itself, calls the underlying operating  system function  in this case to open a file , and places the provided callback function on the  event queue. Execution immediately returns to the  FileObjectfile_exists   function, and    58  Chapter 3  Asynchronous Programming  then you exit. When the  fs.open   function completes its work and Node runs the callback, you  no longer have the context of the  FileObject   class anymore, and the callback function  is given a new  this   pointer!     The bad news is that you have, indeed, lost your  this   pointer referring to the  FileObject class. The good news is that the callback function for  fs.open   does still have its function  scope. A common solution to this problem is to “save” the disappearing  this   pointer in a vari- able called  self   or  me   or something similar. Now rewrite the  file_exists   function to take  advantage of this:        this.file_exists = function  callback  {         var self = this   ;          console.log "About to open: " +  self.filename  ;        fs.open this.filename, 'r', function  err, handle  {            if  err  {                console.log "Can't open: " +  self.filename  ;                callback err ;                return;            }             fs.close handle, function    { } ;            callback null, true ;        } ;    };     Because function scope  is   preserved via closures, the new  self   variable is maintained for you  even when your callback is executed asynchronously later by Node.js. You will make extensive  use of this in all your applications. Some people like to use  me   instead of  self   because it is  shorter; others still use completely different words. Pick whatever kind you like and stick with  it for consistency.     Being Polite—Learning to Give Up Control    Node runs in a single thread with a single event loop that makes calls to external functions and  services. It places callback functions on the event queue to wait for the responses and otherwise  tries to execute code as quickly as possible. So what happens if you have a function that tries to  compute the intersection between two arrays:     function compute_intersection arr1, arr2, callback  {     var results = [];    for  var i = 0 ; i < arr1.length; i++  {        for  var j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++  {            if  arr2[j] == arr1[i]  {                results[results.length] = arr1[j];                break;            }   Being Polite—Learning to Give Up Control  59         }    }    callback null, results ;      no error, pass in results!  }     For arrays of a few thousand elements, this function starts to consume significant amounts of  time to do its work, on the order of a second or more. In a single-threaded model, where Node. js can do only one thing at a time, this amount of time can be a problem. Similar functions  that compute hashes, digests, or otherwise perform expensive operations are going to cause  your applications to temporarily “freeze” while they do their work. What can you do?     In the Introduction to this book, I mentioned that there are certain things for which Node.js is  not particularly well suited, and one of them is definitely acting as a  compute server . Node is far  better suited to more common network application tasks, such as those with heavy amounts  of I O and requests to other services. If you want to write a server that does a lot of expensive  computations and calculations, you might want to consider moving these operations to other  services that your Node applications can then call remotely.     I am not saying, however, that you should completely shy away from computationally inten- sive tasks. If you’re doing these only some of the time, you can still include them in Node.js  and take advantage of a method on the  process   global object called  nextTick . This method  basically says, “Give up control of execution, and then when you have a free moment, call the  provided function.” It tends to be significantly faster than just using the  setTimeout   function.     Listing    3.2   contains an updated version of the  compute_intersection   function that yields  every once in a while to let Node process other tasks.     Listing 3.2      Using processnextTick to Be Polite     function compute_intersection arr1, arr2, callback  {        let's break up the bigger of the two arrays    var bigger = arr1.length > arr2.length ? arr1 : arr2;    var smaller = bigger == arr1 ? arr2 : arr1;    var biglen = bigger.length;    var smlen = smaller.length;     var sidx = 0;              starting index of any chunk    var size = 10;             chunk size, can adjust!    var results = [];          intermediate results        for each chunk of "size" elements in bigger, search through smaller    function sub_compute_intersection   {        for  var i = sidx; i <  sidx + size  && i < biglen; i++  {            for  var j = 0; j < smlen; j++  {                if  bigger[i] == smaller[j]  {                    results.push smaller[j] ;                    break;   60  Chapter 3  Asynchronous Programming                 }            }        }         if  i >= biglen  {            callback null, results ;      no error, send back results        } else {            sidx += size;            process.nextTick sub_compute_intersection ;        }    }     sub_compute_intersection  ;  }     In this new version of the function, you basically divide the bigger of the input arrays into  chunks of 10  you can choose whatever number you want , compute the intersection of that  many items, and then call  processnextTick   to allow other events or requests a chance to  do their work. Only when there are no events in front of you any longer will you continue to  do the work. Don’t forget that passing the callback function  sub_compute_intersection   to  processnextTick   ensures that the current scope is preserved as a closure, so you can store  the intermediate results in the variables in  compute_intersection .     Listing    3.3   shows the code you use to test this new  compute_intersection   function.     Listing 3.3      Testing the compute_intersection Function     var a1 = [ 3476, 2457, 7547, 34523, 3, 6, 7,2, 77, 8, 2345,            7623457, 2347, 23572457, 237457, 234869, 237,           24572457524] ;  var a2 = [ 3476, 75347547, 2457634563, 56763472, 34574, 2347,            7, 34652364 , 13461346, 572346, 23723457234, 237,           234, 24352345, 537, 2345235, 2345675, 34534,           7582768, 284835, 8553577, 2577257,545634, 457247247,           2345 ];  compute_intersection a1, a2, function  err, results  {     if  err  {        console.log err ;    } else {        console.log results ;    } } ;     Although this has made things a bit more complicated than the original version of the function  to compute the intersections, the new version plays much better in the single-threaded world    Summary  61  of Node event processing and callbacks, and you can use  process.nextTick   in any situation  in which you are worried that a complex or slow computation is necessary.     Synchronous Function Calls    Now that I have spent nearly an entire chapter telling you how Node.js is very much asynchro- nous and about all the tricks and traps of programming nonblocking IO, I must mention that  Node actually  does   have synchronous versions of some key APIs, most notably file APIs. You use  them for writing command-line tools in  Chapter    11   , “Command-Line Programming.”     To demonstrate briefly here, you can rewrite the first script of this chapter as follows:     var fs = require 'fs' ;  var handle = fs.openSync 'info.txt', 'r' ; var buf = new Buffer 100000 ; var read = fs.readSync handle, buf, 0, 10000, null ; console.log buf.toString 'utf8', 0, read  ; fs.closeSync handle ;  As you work your way through this book, I hope you are able to see quite quickly that Node. js isn’t just for network or web applications. You can use it for everything from command-line  utilities to prototyping to server management and more!     Summary    Switching from a model of programming, where you execute a sequence of synchronous or  blocking IO function calls and wait for each of them to complete before moving on to the next  model where you do everything asynchronously and wait for Node to tell you when a given  task is done, requires a bit of mental gymnastics and experimentation. But I am convinced that  when you get the hang of this, you’ll never be able to imagine going back to the other way of  writing your web apps.     Next, you write your first simple JSON application server.      This page intentionally left blank    Part II  Learning to Run     4 Writing Simple Applications      65       5 Modules      89     6 Expanding Your Web Server    113      This page intentionally left blank    4  Writing Simple Applications     Now that you have a better understanding of how the JavaScript language really works, it’s   time to start unleashing the power of Node.js to write web applications. As I mentioned in  the Introduction to this book, you will work on a small photo album website throughout this  book. In this chapter, you start by working on a JSON server to serve up the list of albums and  pictures in each of those albums, and by the end, you add the capability to rename an album.  In the process, you get a good understanding of the basics of running a JSON   server, as well  as how it interacts with a lot of the basic parts of HTTP such as GET and POST parameters,  headers, requests, and responses. This first generation of the photo album application uses  file APIs to do all its work; it’s a great way to learn about them and lets you focus on the new  concepts you want to learn.     Your First JSON Server    At the end of  Chapter    1,   “Getting Started,” you wrote a little HTTP server that, for any incom- ing request, would return the plain text “Thanks for calling!\n”. Now you can change this a  little bit and have it do few things differently:        Indicate that the returned data is  application json   instead of  text plain .     1.  2.  3.     Print out the incoming request on  console.log .        Return a JSON string.     Here is the trivial server, which is saved to simple_server.js:     var http = require 'http' ;  function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {     console.log "INCOMING REQUEST: " + req.method + " " + req.url ;    res.writeHead 200, { "Content-Type" : "application json" } ;   66  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications     res.end JSON.stringify  { error: null }  + "\n" ;  }  var s = http.createServer handle_incoming_request ; s.listen 8080 ;     Run this program in one terminal window  Mac Linux  or command prompt  Windows  by  typing     node simple_server.js     It should just sit there doing nothing, waiting for a request. Now, in another terminal window,  type     curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080     If you’ve done everything correctly, in the window running the server, you should see     INCOMING REQUEST: GET       {"error":null}     In the window where you ran the  curl   command, you should see     Try running different variations on the  curl   command and see what happens. For example:     curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 gobbledygook     Starting with this first new program, you can standardize the output of your JSON responses to  always have an  error   field in the output. This way, calling applications can quickly determine  the success or failure of the request. In cases in which a failure does occur, you always include a  message   field with more information, and for cases in which the JSON response is supposed to  return some data, you always include a  data   field:        failure responses will look like this: {  error : "missing_data",    message : "You must include a last name for the user" }     success responses will usually have a "data" object {  error : null,    data : {      user: {          first_name: "Horatio",          last_name: "Gadsplatt III",          email: "horatio@example.org"      }  } }     Some applications prefer to use numeric codes for their error systems. Using such codes is  entirely up to you, but I prefer to use text ones because they feel more descriptive and save    Your First JSON Server  67  the step of looking things up when I use command-line programs like  curl   to test programs. I  think  no_such_user   is far more informative than  -325 .     Returning Some Data    When you start, your photo album application is quite simple: It is a collection of albums, each  of which contains a collection of photos, as shown in  Figure    4.1   .     ITALY2012 Our Trip to Italy  JAPAN2010 A Week in Tokyo  AUSTRALIA2010  Melbourne Fun!  For now, the albums are subfolders of the albums  subfolder of the location where you run  your scripts:     So, to get your list of albums, you just need to find the items inside the albums  subfolder. You  do that using the  fs.readdir   function, which returns all items in the given folder except for  “ . ” and “ .. ”. The  load_album_list   function looks as follows:     Figure 4.1      Albums and photos     scripts  scripts albums  scripts albums italy2012 scripts albums australia2010 scripts albums japan2010     function  load_album_list  callback  {     fs.readdir         "albums ",         function    err, files  {   68  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications             if  err  {                callback err ;                return;            }            callback null, files ;        }     ;  }     Let’s walk through this function carefully. To start, it calls the  fs.readdir   function and  provides a function that should be called when all the items in the directory have been loaded.  This callback function has the same prototype that most callbacks have: an  error   parameter and  a  results   parameter; you are free to call these whatever you want.     Note that the only parameter to the  load_album_list   function itself is a callback function.  Because the  load_album_list   function is itself asynchronous, it needs to know where to  pass the list of albums when it is finished with its work. It cannot return a value to the caller,  because it will finish executing long before the  fs.readdir   function calls back to give you the  results.     Again, this is the core technique of Node application programming: You tell Node to do  something and where to send the results when it is done. In the meantime, you go on with  other processing. Many of the tasks you have it perform basically end up being a long series of  callbacks.     Listing    4.1   has the full code for the new album-listing server.     Listing 4.1      The Album-Listing Server  load_albums.js      var http = require 'http' ,     fs = require 'fs' ;  function  load_album_list  callback  {     fs.readdir         "albums",         function    err, files  {            if  err  {                callback err ;                return;            }            callback null, files ;        }     ;  }  function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {     console.log "INCOMING REQUEST: " + req.method + " " + req.url ;    load_album_list  function    err, albums  {   Node Pattern: Asynchronous Loops  69         if  err  {            res.writeHead 503, {"Content-Type": "application json"} ;            res.end JSON.stringify err  + "\n" ;            return;        }         var out = { error: null,                    data: { albums: albums }};        res.writeHead 200, {"Content-Type": "application json"} ;        res.end JSON.stringify out  + "\n" ;    } ;  }  var s = http.createServer handle_incoming_request ; s.listen 8080 ;     In  Listing    4.1   , after  fs.readdir   has finished, you check the results. If an error occurs, you  send that back to the caller  the function you passed to  load_album_list   in the  handle_ incoming_request   function ; otherwise, you send the list of folders  albums  back to the caller  with  null   indicating no error.     This listing adds some new error-handling code to the  handle_incoming_request   function: If  the  fs.readdir   function tells you that something bad has happened, you would like the caller  to be made aware of that fact, so you still return some JSON and the HTTP response code  503 to indicate that something unexpected has happened. The JSON servers should always return as  much information as possible to their clients to help them determine if a problem is something  they did or something internally wrong on the server itself.     To test the program, make sure the folder from which you are running this script has the  albums  subfolder with some album folders in it. To run the server, you again run     node load_albums.js     And to get the results, you use     curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080      The results from the  curl   command should look something like this:     {"error":null,"data":{"albums":["australia2010","italy2012","japan2010"]}}     Node Pattern: Asynchronous Loops    What happens if you create a text file called info.txt in your albums  folder and rerun the  album-listing server? You will probably see results like this:     {"error":null,"data":{"albums":["australia2010", "info.txt" ,"italy2012","japan2010"]}}      70  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications  What you really want is for the program to check the results of  fs.readdir   and return only  those entries that are folders, not regular files. To do this, you can use the  fs.stat   function,  which passes an object you can use to test this.     So, rewrite the  load_album_list   function to loop through the results of  fs.readdir   and test  whether they are folders:     function  load_album_list  callback  {     fs.readdir         "albums",         function    err, files  {            if  err  {                callback err ;                return;            }             var only_dirs = [];            for  var i = 0; i < files.length; i++  {                fs.stat                     "albums " + files[i],                     function  err, stats  {                        if  stats.isDirectory    {                            only_dirs.push files[i] ;                        }                    }                 ;            }             callback null, only_dirs ;        }     ;  }              Keep the rest of the program the same and then run the  curl   command. It should always  return     {"error":null,"data":{"albums":[]}}     You broke the server! What happened?     The problem lies in the new  for   loop you added. Most loops and asynchronous callbacks are  not compatible. Effectively, what you do in the preceding code is        Create an array  only_dirs   to hold the response.        For each item in the files array, call the nonblocking function  fs.stat   and pass it the   provided function to test if the file is a directory.        After all these nonblocking functions have been started, exit the  for   loop and call the   callback   parameter. Because Node.js is single-threaded, none of the  fs.stat   functions    Node Pattern: Asynchronous Loops  71  will have had a chance to execute and call the callbacks yet, so  only_dirs   is still  null ,  and you pass that to the provided  callback . Indeed, when the callbacks to  fs.stat   are  finally called, nobody cares anymore.     To get around this problem, you have to use recursion. You effectively create a new function  with the following format and then immediately call it:     You can actually do one step better and use a named-anonymous function so that you don’t  clutter up your scope with function names:     Thus, to rewrite the loop testing whether or not the files result from  fs.readdir   are folders,  you can write the function as follows:     function  iterator  i  {   if  i < array.length   {     async_work  function  {       iterator  i + 1       }   } else {    callback results ;  }  } iterator 0       function  iterator  i  {   if  i < array.length   {     async_work  function  {       iterator  i + 1       }   } else {    callback results ;  }  }  0 ;     function  load_album_list  callback  {     fs.readdir         "albums",         function    err, files  {            if  err  {                callback err ;                return;            }             var only_dirs = [];              function   iterator index  {                if  index == files.length  {                    callback null, only_dirs ;                    return;                }   72  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications                 fs.stat                     "albums " + files[index],                     function    err, stats  {                        if  err  {                            callback err ;                            return;                        }                        if  stats.isDirectory    {                            only_dirs.push files[index] ;                        }                        iterator index + 1                     }                 ;            }  0 ;        }     ;  }     Save this new version of the simple JSON server and then run the  curl   command, and you  should now see the results with only album folders and no files included.     Learning to Juggle: Handling More Requests    The photo-album JSON server currently responds to only one kind of request: a request for a  list of albums. Indeed, it doesn’t even really care how you call this request; it just returns the  same thing all the time.     You can expand the functionality of the server a bit to allow you to request either of the  following:       1.     A list of albums available—you call this  albums.json   .    2.     A list of items in an album—you can call this    albums  album_name .json.     Adding the .json suffix to requests emphasizes that you are currently writing a JSON server that  works only with that.     A new version of the  handle_incoming_request   function with support for these two requests  could be as follows:     function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {     console.log "INCOMING REQUEST: " + req.method + " " + req.url ;     if  req.url == ' albums.json'  {         handle_list_albums req, res ;     } else if  req.url.substr 0, 7  == ' albums'                 && req.url.substr req.url.length - 5  == '.json'  {         handle_get_album req, res ;    } else {   Learning to Juggle: Handling More Requests  73         send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource   ;    }  }     The two  if   statements in the preceding code are the bold ones; both look at the  url   property  on the incoming  request   object. If the request is simply for  albums.json, you can handle the  request as before. If it’s for  albums something.json, you can assume it’s a request for the listing  of an album’s contents and process it as appropriate.     The code to generate and return the albums list has been moved into a new function called  handle_list_albums , and the code to get an individual album’s contents is similarly orga- nized into two functions called  handle_get_album   and  load_album .  Listing    4.2   contains the  full listing for the server.     Starting with this new version of the code, you can change the output of the JSON server  slightly: Everything returned will be objects, not just arrays of strings. This helps you later in  the book when you start generating UI to match the JSON responses. I italicized the code in  Listing    4.2   that makes this change.     Although I try to avoid long, tedious, multipage code dumps later in this book, this first  version of the server here is worth browsing through fully because most things you do after this  are based on the foundation built here.

This code is in the  send_success   and  send_failure   functions, both of which make sure to set the right HTTP response code and  then return the correct JSON as appropriate.     You can see that the new function  load_album   is quite similar to the  load_album_list   func- tion. It enumerates all the items in the album folder, then goes through each of them to make  sure it is a regular file, and returns that final list. I also added a couple extra lines of code to the  error handling for  fs.readdir   in  load_album :      Learning to Juggle: Handling More Requests  77  if  err.code == "ENOENT"  {       see text for more info     callback no_such_album   ;  } else {  }        callback { error: "file_error",               message: JSON.stringify err  } ;  Basically, if  fs.readdir   fails because it cannot find the album folder, that is a user error; the  user specified an invalid album. You want to return an error indicating that fact, so you do  that by using the helper function  no_such_album . Most other failures, however, are likely to  be server configuration problems, so you want to return the more generic  "file_error"   for  those.     The output of getting  albums.json now looks as follows:     {"error":null,"data":{"albums":[{"name":"australia2010"},{"name":"italy2012"},{"name": "japan2010"}]}}     After putting a few image files in each of the album folders, the output of getting the contents  of an album  such as  albums italy2012.json  now looks as follows  it’s been cleaned up here :     {   "error": null,  "data": {    "album_data": {      "short_name": " italy2012",      "photos": [        {          "filename": "picture_01.jpg",          "desc": "picture_01.jpg"        },        {          "filename": "picture_02.jpg",          "desc": "picture_02.jpg"        },        {          "filename": "picture_03.jpg",          "desc": "picture_03.jpg"        },        {          "filename": "picture_04.jpg",          "desc": "picture_04.jpg"        },        {          "filename": "picture_05.jpg",          "desc": "picture_05.jpg"        }      ]    }  } }      78  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications  More on the Request and Response Objects    Now enter and run the following program:     var http = require 'http' ;  function handle_incoming_request req, res  {     console.log "---------------------------------------------------" ;    console.log req ;    console.log "---------------------------------------------------" ;    console.log res ;    console.log "---------------------------------------------------" ;    res.writeHead 200, { "Content-Type" : "application json" } ;    res.end JSON.stringify  { error: null }  + "\n" ;  }  var s = http.createServer handle_incoming_request ; s.listen 8080 ;     Then, in another terminal window, run the  curl   command on something from this server:     curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080     Your client window should just print  error: null , but the server window prints an extremely  large amount of text with information about the request and response objects passed to your  HTTP server.     You’ve already used two properties on the request object:  method   and  url . The former tells you  if the incoming request is  GET ,  POST ,  PUT , or  DELETE    or something else such as  HEAD  , whereas  the latter contains the URL requested on the server.     The request object is a  ServerRequest   object provided by the HTTP module included in Node. js, and you can learn all about it by consulting the Node documentation. You use these two  properties and also see more in a little bit about handling POST data with the  ServerRequest .  You can also examine incoming headers by looking at the  headers   property.     If you look at the headers the  curl   program sends to you, you see     { 'user-agent': 'curl 7.24.0  x86_64-apple-darwin12.0  libcurl 7.24.0 OpenSSL 0.9.8r  zlib 1.2.5',   host: 'localhost:8080',  accept: '* *' }     { host: 'localhost:8080',  Firefox 16.0',  If you call the JSON server in the browser, you see something like      'user-agent': 'Mozilla 5.0  Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:16.0  Gecko 20100101    accept: 'text html,application xhtml+xml,application xml;q=0.9,* *;q=0.8',  'accept-language': 'en-US,en;q=0.5',  'accept-encoding': 'gzip, deflate',  connection: 'keep-alive' }      Increased Flexibility: GET Params  79  On the response side, you have already used two methods:  writeHead   and  end . You must  call  end   on the response object once and only once for each incoming request. Otherwise, the  client never gets the response and continues to listen on the connection for more data.     When you are writing your responses, you should take care to make sure you think about your  HTTP response codes  see the sidebar “HTTP Response Codes” . Part of writing your servers  includes thinking logically about what you are trying to communicate to the calling clients and  sending them as much information as possible to help them understand your response.     HTTP Response Codes    The HTTP specification contains a large number of response codes a server can return to call- ing clients. You can learn more about them on Wikipedia   http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki List_of_ HTTP_status_codes  .    Although a dizzying number of response codes is possible, you’ll find yourself using a few of  the more common responses in most of your applications:                                200 OK—Everything went fine.          301 Moved Permanently—The requested URL has been moved, and the client should re- request it at the URL specified in the response.                400 Bad Request—The format of the client’s request is invalid and needs to be fixed.     401 Unauthorized—The client has asked for something it does not have permission to  view. It should try again authenticating the request first.     403 Forbidden—For whatever reason, the server is refusing to process this request. This  is not the same as 401, where the client  can   try again with authentication.     404 Not Found—The client has asked for something that does not exist.     500 Internal Server Error—Something happened resulting in the server being unable  to process the request. You typically use this error for situations in which you know  the code has entered some sort of inconsistent or buggy state and needs developer  attention.                503 Service Unavailable—This indicates some sort of runtime failure, such as temporar-  ily low on memory or having troubles with network resources. It’s still a fatal error like  500, but it does suggest the client could try again in a while.     These are the codes you will use the most, but there are many others that you are encouraged  to browse over. If you’re unsure when to use one, look at code that others have written and  see how they do it. The correct code for any given situation can be cause for great debate, but  you can usually get the right ones without too much trouble.     Increased Flexibility: GET Params    When you start adding a lot of photos to your albums, you will have too many photos to  display efficiently on one “page” of the application, so you should add paging functionality to    80  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications  it. Clients should be able to say how many photos they want and what page they want,  like this:     curl -X GET 'http:  localhost:8080 albums italy2012.json?page=1&page_size=20'     If you’re not familiar with the terminology, the bolded part of the preceding URL is the   query string , commonly just referred to as the  GET params   for the request. If you run this curl command with the previous version of the program, you’ll probably notice that it doesn’t quite  work any more. If you add the following to the beginning of  handle_incoming_request , you  can see why:     console.log req.url ;     The URL now looks like this:      albums italy2012.json ?page=1&page_size=20     The code is looking for the  .json   at the end of the string, not buried in the middle of it. To fix  the code to handle paging, you have to do three things:     1.  2.  3.     Modify the  handle_incoming_request   function to parse the URL properly.        Parse the query string and get the values for  page   and  page_size .        Modify the  load_album   function to support these parameters.     You are fortunate in that you can do the first two in one fell swoop. If you add the  url   module  that Node ships with, you can then use the  url.parse   function to extract both the core URL  pathname and the query parameters. The  url.parse   function helps a little bit further in that  you can add a second parameter,  true , which instructs it to parse the query string and gener- ate an object with the GET parameters in it. If you print out the results of  url.parse   on the  preceding URL, you should see     { search: '?page=1&page_size=20',   query: { page: '1', page_size: '20' },  pathname: ' albums italy2012.json',  path: ' albums italy2012.json?page=1&page_size=20',       href: ' albums italy2012.json?page=1&page_size=20' }     Now you can modify the  handle_incoming_request   function to parse the URL and store it  back on the request object in  parsed_ur l. The function now looks like this:     function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {      req.parsed_url = url.parse req.url, true ;      var core_url = req.parsed_url.pathname;         test this fixed url to see what they're asking for    if   core_url   == ' albums.json'  {        handle_list_albums req, res ;   Increased Flexibility: GET Params  81     } else if   core_url .substr 0, 7  == ' albums'               &&  core_url .substr  core_url .length - 5  == '.json'  {        handle_get_album req, res ;    } else {        send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource   ;    }  For the last part, you modify the  handle_get_album   function to look for the page and  page_ num   query parameters. You can set some reasonable default values for them when the incoming  values are not provided or are not valid values.  The servers should  always   assume that incom- ing values are dangerous or nonsensical and check them carefully.      }     }     function  handle_get_album  req, res  {        get the GET params     var getp = req.parsed_url.query;      var page_num = getp.page ? getp.page : 0;      var page_size = getp.page_size ? getp.page_size : 1000;       if  isNaN parseInt page_num    page_num = 0;      if  isNaN parseInt page_size    page_size = 1000;          format of request is  albums album_name.json      var core_url = req.parsed_url.pathname;      var album_name = core_url.substr 7, core_url.length - 12 ;    load_album         album_name,         page_num,          page_size,          function    err, album_contents  {            if  err && err.error == "no_such_album"  {                send_failure res, 404, err ;            }  else if  err  {                send_failure res, 500, err ;            } else {                send_success res, { album_photos: album_contents } ;            }        }     ;  Finally, you modify the  load_album   function to extract the subarray of the  files_only   array  when it’s done with all its work:      82  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications  function  load_album  album_name,  page ,  page_size , callback  {     fs.readdir         "albums " + album_name,         function    err, files  {            if  err  {                if  err.code == "ENOENT"  {                    callback no_such_album   ;                } else {                    callback { error: "file_error",                               message: JSON.stringify err  } ;                }                return;            }             var only_files = [];            var path = "albums " + album_name + " ";              function  iterator  index  {                if  index == files.length  {                     var ps;                         slice fails gracefully if params are out of range                      ps = only_files.splice page * page_size, page_size ;                      var obj = { short_name: album_name,                                  photos: ps };                      callback null, obj ;                     return;                }                 fs.stat                     path + files[index],                     function    err, stats  {                        if  err  {                            callback { error: "file_error",                                       message: JSON.stringify err    } ;                            return;                        }                        if  stats.isFile    {                            var obj = { filename: files[index], desc: files[index] };                            only_files.push obj ;                        }                        iterator index + 1                     }                 ;            }  0 ;        }     ;  }      Modifying Things: POST Data  83  Modifying Things: POST Data    Now that I’ve largely covered how to get things from your JSON server, you might like to start  being able to send data to it, either to create new things or modify existing ones. This is typi- cally done with HTTP POST data, and you can send the data in many different formats. To send  data using the  curl   client, you must do a few things:     1.  2.  3.     Set the HTTP method parameter to  POST    or  PUT  .        Set the  Content-Type   of the incoming data.        Send the data itself.     You can easily accomplish these tasks with  curl . You do the first simply by changing the  method name, the second by specifying HTTP headers with the  -H   flag to  curl , and the last  you can do in a few different ways, but here you can use the  -d   flag and just write the JSON as  a string.     Now it’s time add some new functionality to the server to allow you to rename albums. Make  the URL format as follows and specify that it must be a POST request:     http:  localhost:8080 albums  albumname  rename.json     So, the  curl   command to rename an album is now the following:     curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application json" \      -d '{ "album_name" : " new album name " }' \     http:  localhost:8080 albums  old_album_name  rename.json     Modifying the  handle_incoming_request   to accept the new request type is pretty easy:     function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {        parse the query params into an object and get the path       without them.  2nd param true = parse the params .    req.parsed_url = url.parse req.url, true ;    var core_url = req.parsed_url.pathname;        test this fixed url to see what they're asking for    if  core_url == ' albums.json' && req.method.toLowerCase   == 'get'  {        handle_list_albums req, res ;     } else if  core_url.substr core_url.length - 12   == ' rename.json'                 && req.method.toLowerCase   == 'post'  {          handle_rename_album req, res ;     } else if  core_url.substr 0, 7  == ' albums'               && core_url.substr core_url.length - 5  == '.json'               && req.method.toLowerCase   == 'get'  {        handle_get_album req, res ;   84  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications     } else {        send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource   ;    }  }     Note that you have to put the code to handle the rename request before the load-album  request; otherwise, the code would have treated it as an album called  rename   and just executed  handle_get_album .     Receiving JSON POST Data    To get the POST data in the program, you use a Node feature called  streams . Streams are a  powerful way to transfer large amounts of data in Node while maintaining the asynchronous,  nonblocking nature of the system. I cover streams more fully in  Chapter    6   , “Expanding Your  Web Server,” but for now, you just need to know the key pattern for using streams:     .on  event_name , function  parm  { ... } ;     In particular, pay attention to two events for now: the  readable   and  end   events. The stream  is actually just the  ServerRequest   object from the http module  which inherits from the class  Stream ;  ServerResponse   does, too! , and you listen to these two events via the following  pattern:        var json_body = '';    req.on          'readable' ,         function      {             var d = req.read  ;             if  d  {                if  typeof d == 'string'  {                    json_body += d;                } else if  typeof d == 'object' && d instanceof Buffer  {                    json_body += d.toString 'utf8' ;                }            }        }     ;     req.on          'end' ,         function      {               did we get a valid body?            if  json_body  {                try {                    var body = JSON.parse json_body ;                       use it and then call the callback!                    callback null, ... ;   Modifying Things: POST Data  85                 } catch  e  {                    callback { error: "invalid_json",                               message: "The body is not valid JSON" } ;            } else {                callback { error: "no_body",                           message: "We did not receive any   JSON" } ;                }            }        }     ;     For each piece  chunk  of data forming the body of the incoming request, the function you  pass to the  on 'readable', ...    handler is called. In the preceding code, you first read the  data from the stream with the  read   method and append this incoming data to the end of the  json_body   variable; then when you get the  end   event, you take the resulting string and try to  parse it.  JSON.parse   throws an error if the given string is not valid JSON, so you have to wrap  it in a  try catch   block.     The function to process the request for a rename is as follows:     function  handle_rename_album  req, res  {         1.   Get the album name from the URL    var core_url = req.parsed_url.pathname;    var parts = core_url.split ' ' ;    if  parts.length != 4  {        send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource core_url  ;        return;    }     var album_name = parts[2];         2.   get the POST data for the request. this will have the JSON       for the new name for the album.    var json_body = '';    req.on          'readable' ,         function      {            var d = req.read  ;            if  d  {                if  typeof d == 'string'  {                    json_body += d;                } else if  typeof d == 'object' && d instanceof Buffer  {                    json_body += d.toString 'utf8' ;                }            }        }     ;   86  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications         3.   when   we have all the post data, make sure we have valid          data and then try to do the rename.    req.on          'end' ,         function      {               did we get a body?            if  json_body  {                try {                    var album_data = JSON.parse json_body ;                    if  !album_data.album_name  {                       send_failure res, 403, missing_data 'album_name'  ;                       return;                    }                } catch  e  {                       got a body, but not valid json                    send_failure res, 403, bad_json   ;                    return;                }                     4.   Perform rename!                do_rename                     album_name,               old                    album_data.album_name,    new                     function    err, results  {                        if  err && err.code == "ENOENT"  {                            send_failure res, 403, no_such_album   ;                            return;                        } else if  err  {                            send_failure res, 500, file_error err  ;                            return;                        }                        send_success res, null ;                    }                 ;            } else {    didn't get a body                send_failure res, 403, bad_json   ;                res.end  ;            }        }     ;  }     The complete listing for the updated server that can now handle three requests is in the  Chapter    4   GitHub source code as post_data.js. Please note that if you are running a version  of node earlier than 0.10, the above code will generate errors and not function. I’ll explain in  more detail in  Chapter    6   what changed.      Modifying Things: POST Data  87  Receiving Form POST Data    Although you won’t use this as much in your application, a lot of data sent to servers from web  applications are sent via      elements, for example:           Name:       Age:                If you write a little server program to fetch the POST data using the  readable   and  end   events  as you did in the preceding section, printing out the data for the preceding form yields     name=marky+mark&age=23     What you really need, however, is something similar to what you got previously with JSON:  a JavaScript object that represents the data sent to you. To achieve this, you can use another  module built into Node.js,  querystring , and specifically, its parse function, as follows:     var POST_data = qs.parse body ;     The resulting object is as you expect it to be:     { name: 'marky mark++', age: '23' }     The complete listing of the simple server to receive a form and print out its contents is as  follows:     var http = require 'http' , qs = require 'querystring' ;  function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {     var body = '';    req.on          'readable' ,         function      {            var d = req.read  ;            if  d  {                if  typeof d == 'string'  {                    body += d;                } else if  typeof d == 'object' && d instanceof Buffer  {                    body += d.toString 'utf8' ;                }            }        }     ;     req.on         'end',         function      {   88  Chapter 4  Writing Simple Applications             if  req.method.toLowerCase   == 'post'  {                var POST_data = qs.parse body ;                console.log POST_data ;            }            res.writeHead 200, { "Content-Type" : "application json" } ;            res.end JSON.stringify  { error: null }  + "\n" ;        }     ;     var s = http.createServer handle_incoming_request ;    s.listen 8080 ;  }              Starting in  Chapter    6   , however, when you learn how to use the  express   web application frame- work for Node, you’ll see that this functionality is typically all handled for you.     Summary    This chapter covered quite a lot of new material. You wrote your first web application by  writing a simple JSON server. I like this approach for a few key reasons:        It lets you focus on the server and the key concepts you need to get really comfortable   with Node.js.        You can make sure your server API is well organized and efficient.        A nice, light application server should mean that the computer s  running it will be able  to handle the load without too much trouble. When you add in HTML UI and client-side  features later, you can try to have the client do as much of the work as possible.     Now you not only have a basic working server, but also have seen how to modify the output it  sends you with different request URLs and query parameters. You have also seen how to send  new data or modify existing data by submitting POST data along with the request. Although  some of the programs look reasonably long and complicated already, you are working with just  basic components right now to examine core Node principles. You start to replace these with  more helpful and functional modules quite soon.     But first, take a break and learn more about  modules —much more on how to consume them  and also how to write your own.      5  Modules     In the Node.js servers and scripts you have written thus far, you have already consumed exter-  nal functionality in the form of modules. In this chapter, I explain how this all works and how  to write your own. In addition to all the already-powerful and functional modules that Node  provides for you, there is a huge community further developing modules that you can take  advantage of in your programs, and indeed you can even write your own to give something  back!     One of the cool things about Node is that you don’t really distinguish between modules that  you have produced and modules that you consume from external repositories, such as those  you see later in this chapter via  npm , the Node Package Manager. When you write separate  classes and groups of functions in Node, you put them in basically the same format—perhaps  with a bit less dressing and documentation—as modules you download from the Internet  and use. In fact, it usually takes only an extra bit of JSON and maybe a line or two of code to  prepare your code for consumption   by others!     Node ships with a large number of built-in modules, all of which are packaged in the  node executable on your system. You can view their source if you download the Node source code  from the nodejs.org website. They all live in the lib  subdirectory.     Writing Simple Modules    At a high level, modules are a way to group common functionality in Node.js. If you have  a library of functions or classes for working with a particular database server, for example, it  would make a lot of sense to put that code into a module and package it for consumption.     Every file in Node.js is a module , although modules do not necessarily have to be this simple. You  can package complex modules with many files, unit tests, documentation, and other support  files into folders and consume them in the same way you would a module with only a single  JavaScript file  see “Writing Modules” later in this chapter .      90  Chapter 5  Modules  To write your own module that exposes, or  exports , a function called  hello_world , you can  write the following and save it to mymodule.js:     exports.hello_world = function    {     console.log "Hello World" ;  }     The  exports   object is a special object created by the Node module system in every file you  create and is returned as the value of the  require   function when you include that module. It  lives off the  module   object that every module has, and is used to expose functions, variables,  or classes. In the simple example here, the module exposes a single function on the  exports object, and to consume it, you could write the following and save it to modtest.js:     var mm = require  '. mymodule' ; mm.hello_world  ;     Running  node modtest.js    causes Node to print out  "Hello World"   exactly as you would  expect. You can expose as many functions and classes as you want off the  exports   object as  you’d like. For example:     function  Greeter    lang  {    this.language = lang;    this.greet   = function    {        switch  this.language  {          case "en": return "Hello!";          case "de": return "Hallo!";          case "jp": return "          default: return "No speaka that language";        }    }  !";  }  }  }  }     exports. hello_world   = function    {     console.log "Hello World" ;  exports. goodbye   = function    {     console.log "Bye bye!" ;  exports.create_ greeter   = function  lang  {     return new Greeter lang ;  The  module   variable given to each module contains information such as the filename of the  current module, its child modules, its parent modules, and more.      Writing Simple Modules  91  Modules and Objects    You frequently return objects from modules that you write. There are two key patterns through  which you do this.     The Factory Model    The previous sample module contains a class called  Greeter . To get an instance of a  Greeter object, you call a creation function—or  factory function —to create and return an instance of this  class. The basic model is as follows:     function ABC  parms  {     this.varA = ...;    this.varB = ...;    this.functionA = function    {        ...    }  exports.create_ABC = function  parms  {     return new ABC parms ;  }  }     }  The advantage to this model is that the module can still expose other functions and classes via  the  exports   object.     The Constructor Model    Another way to expose classes from a module you write would be to completely replace the  exports   object in the module with a class that you want people to use:     function ABC    {     this.varA = 10;    this.varB = 20;    this.functionA = function  var1, var2  {        console.log var1 + " " + var2 ;    }  module.exports = ABC;     To use this module, you would change your code to be the following:     var ABCClass = require '. conmod2' ; var obj = new ABCClass  ; obj.functionA 1, 2 ;     Thus, the only thing you are really exposing from the module is a constructor for the class.  This approach feels nice and OOP-y, but has the disadvantage of not letting you expose much    92  Chapter 5  Modules  else from your module; it also tends to feel a bit awkward in the Node way of doing things. I  showed it to you here so that you can recognize it for what it is when you see it, but you will  almost never use it in this book or your projects—you will largely stick with the factory model.     npm: The Node Package Manager    Apart from writing your own modules and using those provided by Node.js, you will frequently  use code written by other people in the Node community and published on the Internet.  The most common way this is done today is by using  npm , the  Node Package Manager .  npm   is  installed with your node installation  as you saw in  Chapter    1   , “Getting Started” , and you can  go to the command line and type  npm help   to verify that it’s still there and working.     To install modules via  npm , you use the  npm install   command. This technique requires only  the name of the module package you want to install. Many  npm   modules have their source code  hosted on github.com, so they usually tell you the name required, for example:     Kimidori:p1 marcw$  npm install mysql  npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org mysql npm http 200 https:  registry.npmjs.org mysql npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org mysql - mysql-2.0.0-alpha4.tgz npm http 200 https:  registry.npmjs.org mysql - mysql-2.0.0-alpha4.tgz npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org require-all 0.0.3 npm http 200 https:  registry.npmjs.org require-all 0.0.3 npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org require-all - require-all-0.0.3.tgz npm http 200 https:  registry.npmjs.org require-all - require-all-0.0.3.tgz mysql@2.0.0-alpha4 node_modules mysql ___ require-all@0.0.3     If you’re not sure of the name of the package you want to install, you can use the  npm search  command , as follows:     npm search sql     This command prints the name and description of all matching modules.     npm   installs module packages to the node_modules  subdirectory of your project. If a module  package itself has any dependencies, they are installed to a node_modules  subdirectory of that  module’s folder:     + project      + node_modules         module1        module2            + node_modules                dependency1    main.js      To see a list of all modules that a project is currently using, you can use the  npm ls   command:     Consuming Modules  93  Kimidori:handlers marcw$  npm ls  Users marcw src scratch project ___  async@0.1.22 ___  bcrypt@0.7.3 ___  bindings@1.0.0  ___  mysql@2.0.0-alpha4  ___  require-all@0.0.3     To update an installed package to a newer version, use the  npm update   command. If you  specify a package name, it updates only that one. If you do not specify a package name, it  updates all packages to their latest version:     Kimidori:p1 marcw$  npm update mysql  npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org mysql npm http 304 https:  registry.npmjs.org mysql Kimidori:p1 marcw$  npm update  npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org bcrypt npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org async npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org mysql npm http 304 https:  registry.npmjs.org mysql npm http 304 https:  registry.npmjs.org bcrypt npm http 304 https:  registry.npmjs.org async npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org require-all 0.0.3 npm http GET https:  registry.npmjs.org bindings 1.0.0 npm http 304 https:  registry.npmjs.org require-all 0.0.3 npm http 304 https:  registry.npmjs.org bindings 1.0.0     Consuming Modules    As you have already seen, to include a module in a Node file that you are writing, you use the  require   function. To be able to reference the functions and or classes on that module, you  assign the results  the  exports   object of the loaded module  to a variable:     var http = require 'http' ;     Included modules are private to the module that includes them, so if a.js loads the http  module, then b.js cannot reference it, unless it itself also loads http.     Searching for Modules    Node.js uses a pretty straightforward set of rules for finding modules requested with the  require   function:      94  Chapter 5  Modules    1.     If the requested module is a built-in one—such as http or fs—Node uses that.       2.    3.     If the module name in the  require   function begins with a path component— .  ,  ..  , or      — Node looks in the specified directory for that module and tries to load it there. If you  don’t specify a .js extension on your module name, Node first looks for a folder-based  module of that name. If it does not find that, it then adds the extensions .js, .json, .node,  and in turn tries to load modules of those types.  Modules with the extension .node are  compiled add-on modules.         If the module name does not have a path component at the beginning, Node looks in  the node_modules     subfolder of the current folder for the module there. If it is found,  that is loaded; otherwise, Node works its way up the path tree of the current location  looking for node_modules  folders there. If those continue to fail, it looks in some  standard default locations, such as  usr lib or  usr local lib.       4.     If the module isn’t found in any of these locations, an error is thrown.     Module Caching    After a module has been loaded from a particular file or directory, Node.js caches it. Subsequent  calls to  require   that would load the same module  from the same location   to get the exact same  code, with any initialization or other work that has taken place. This is interesting because  sometimes two files that are asking to load a particular module might get different ones!  Consider the following project structure:     + project      + node_modules         + special_widget             + node_modules                 mail_widget  v2.0.1         mail_widget  v1.0.0     main.js    utils.js     In this example, if either main.js or utils.js requires mail_widget, it gets v1.0.0 because Node’s  search rules find it in the node_modules  subdirectory of project. However, if it requires  special_widget, which in turn wishes to use mail_widget, special_widget gets its own privately  included version of mail_widget, the v2.0.1 one in its own node_modules  folder.     This is one of the most powerful and awesome features of the Node.js module system!   In so many  other systems, modules, widgets, or dynamic libraries are all stored in a central location, which  creates versioning nightmares when you require packages that themselves require different  versions of some other module. In Node, they are free to include these different versions of the  other modules, and Node’s namespace and module rules mean that they do not interfere with  each other at all! Individual modules and portions of a project are free to include, update, or  modify included modules as they see fit without   affecting the rest of the system.      In short, Node.js works intuitively, and for perhaps the first time in your life, you don’t have to  sit there endlessly cursing the package repository system you’re using.     Writing Modules  95  Cycles    Consider the following situation:        a.js requires b.js.        b.js requires a.js.        main.js requires a.js.                             You can see that you clearly have a cycle in the preceding modules. Node stops cycles from  being a problem by simply returning uninitialized modules when it detects one. In the preced- ing case, the following happens:        main.js is loaded, and code runs that requires a.js.        a.js is loaded, and code runs that requires b.js.        b.js is loaded, and code runs that requires a.js.        Node detects the cycle and returns an object referring to a.js, but does not execute any   more code—the loading and initialization of a.js are unfinished at this point!        b.js, a.js, and main.js all finish initializing  in that order , and then the reference from   b.js to a.js is valid and fully usable.     Writing Modules    Recall that every file in Node.js is itself a module, with a  module   and  exports   object. However,  you also should know that modules can be a bit more complicated than that, with a directory  to hold its contents and a file containing packaging information. For those cases in which you  want to write a bunch of support files, break up the functionality of the module into separate  JavaScript files, or even include unit tests, you can write modules in this format.     The basic format is as follows:       1.     Create the folder to hold the module contents.       2.    3.     Put a file called package.json into this folder. This file should contain at least a name for  the module and main JavaScript file that Node should load initially for that module.        If Node cannot find the package.json file or no main JavaScript file is specified, it looks  for index.js  or index.node for compiled add-on modules .      96  Chapter 5  Modules  Creating Your Module    Now take the code you wrote for managing photos and albums in the preceding chapter and  put it into a module. Doing so lets you share it with other projects that you write later and  isolate the code so you can write unit tests, and so on.     First, create the following directory structure in the source scratch  that is, ~ src scratch or  wherever you’re playing around with Node  directory:     + album_mgr      + lib     + test      { "name": "album-manager",   "version": "1.0.0",  "main": ". lib albums.js" }     In the album_mgr folder, create a file called package.json and put the following in it:     This is the most basic of package.json files; it tells  npm   that the package should have the  friendly name album-manager and that the “default” or starting JavaScript file for the package  is the albums.js file in the lib  subdirectory.     The preceding directory structure is by no means mandatory or written in stone; it is simply  one of the common layouts for packages that I have found to be useful and have thus latched  on to. You are under no obligation to follow it. I do, however, recommend that you start doing  things this way and start experimenting only after you’re comfortable with the whole system.     Sites such as github.com that are frequently used to host Node module source automatically  display Readme documentation if they find it. Thus, it is pretty common for people to include  a Readme.md.  The “md” stands for  markdown   and refers to the standard documentation format  that github.com uses.  You are highly encouraged to write documentation for your modules to  help people get started using it. For the album-manager module, I wrote the following Readme  file:      Album-Manager   Album Manager   Album Object  This is our module for managing photo albums based on a directory. We assume that, given a path, there is an albums sub-folder, and each of its individual sub-folders are themselves the albums.  Files in those sub-folders are photos.  The album manager exposes a single function, `albums`, which returns an array of `Album` objects for each album it contains.  The album object has the following two properties and one method:   Writing Modules  97  * `name` -- The name of the album * `path` -- The path to the album * `photos  ` -- Calling this method will return all the album's photos     Now you can write your actual module files. First, start with the promised lib albums.js, which  is just some of the album-loading code from  Chapter    4   , “Writing Applications,” repackaged  into a module-like JavaScript file:     var fs = require 'fs' ,     album = require '. album.js' ;  exports.version = "1.0.0";  exports.albums =  function    root, callback  {        we will just assume that any directory in our 'albums'       subfolder is an album.    fs.readdir         root + " albums",         function    err, files  {            if  err  {                callback err ;                return;            }             var album_list = [];               function   iterator index  {                if  index == files.length  {                    callback null, album_list ;                    return;                }                 fs.stat                     root + "albums " + files[index],                     function    err, stats  {                        if  err  {                            callback { error: "file_error",                                       message: JSON.stringify err  } ;                            return;                        }                        if  stats.isDirectory    {                            var p = root + "albums " + files[index];                            album_list.push album.create_album p  ;                        }                        iterator index + 1                     }                 ;   98  Chapter 5  Modules             }  0 ;        }     ;  };     One of the standard things to provide in the exported functionality of modules is a  version member field. Although I don’t always use it, it can be a helpful way for calling modules to  check your version and execute different code depending on what it has.     You can see that the album functionality is split into a new file called lib album.js, and there is  a new class called  Album . This class looks as follows:     function   Album  album_path  {     this.name = path.basename album_path ;    this.path = album_path;  }  Album. prototype .name = null; Album. prototype .path = null; Album. prototype ._photos = null;  Album. prototype .photos =  function    callback  {     if  this._photos != null  {        callback null, this._photos ;        return;    }     var self = this;     fs.readdir         self.path,         function    err, files  {            if  err  {                if  err.code == "ENOENT"  {                    callback no_such_album   ;                } else {                    callback { error: "file_error",                               message: JSON.stringify err  } ;                }                return;            }             var only_files = [];               function   iterator index  {                if  index == files.length  {                    self._photos = only_files;                    callback null, self._photos ;   Writing Modules  99                     return;                }                 fs.stat                     self.path + " " + files[index],                     function    err, stats  {                        if  err  {                            callback { error: "file_error",                                       message: JSON.stringify err  } ;                            return;                        }                        if  stats.isFile    {                            only_files.push files[index] ;                        }                        iterator index + 1                     }                 ;            }  0 ;        }     ;  };       1.    2.  If you’re confused by the  prototype   keyword used a few times in the preceding source code,  perhaps now is a good time to jump back to  Chapter    2,   “A Closer Look at JavaScript,” and  review the section on writing classes in JavaScript. The  prototype   keyword here is simply a  way to set properties on all instances of our Album class.     Again, this is pretty much what you saw in  Chapter    4   with the basic JSON server. The only  thing that is really different is that it is packaged into a class with a prototype object and  method called  photos .     I hope you also noted the following two things:        You now use a new built-in module called  path , and you use the  basename   function on it  to extract the album’s name from the path.        As mentioned in the section “Who Am I? Maintaining a Sense of Identity” in  Chapter    3   ,  “Asynchronous Programming,” nonblock asynchronous IO and the  this   pointer can get  a little tricky, so you use the  var self = this   trick to help you remember your object  reference.     The rest of the album.js file is simply as follows:     var path = require 'path' ,     fs = require 'fs' ;     Album class code goes here    100  Chapter 5  Modules  exports.create_album =  function    path  {     return new Album path ;  };  }     function   no_such_album   {     return { error: "no_such_album",             message: "The specified album does not exist" };  And that is all you need for our album-manager module! To test it, go back to the scratch direc- tory and enter the following test program as atest.js:     var amgr = require '. album_mgr' ;  amgr.albums '. ', function  err, albums  {     if  err  {        console.log "Unexpected error: " + JSON.stringify err  ;        return;    }      function iterator index  {        if  index == albums.length  {            console.log "Done" ;            return;        }         albums[index].photos function  err, photos  {            if  err  {                console.log "Err loading album: " + JSON.stringify err  ;                return;            }             console.log albums[index].name ;            console.log photos ;            console.log "" ;            iterator index + 1 ;        } ;    }  0 ;  } ;     Kimidori:Chapter05 marcw$  node atest australia2010 [ 'aus_01.jpg',  'aus_02.jpg',  'aus_03.jpg',  Now, all you have to do is ensure you have an albums  subfolder in the current directory, and  you should be able to run atest.js and see something like the following:      Writing Modules  101   'aus_04.jpg',  'aus_05.jpg',  'aus_06.jpg',  'aus_07.jpg',  'aus_08.jpg',  'aus_09.jpg' ]  italy2012 [ 'picture_01.jpg',  'picture_02.jpg',  'picture_03.jpg',  'picture_04.jpg',  'picture_05.jpg' ]  japan2010 [ 'picture_001.jpg',  'picture_002.jpg',  'picture_003.jpg',  'picture_004.jpg',  'picture_005.jpg',  'picture_006.jpg',  'picture_007.jpg' ]  Done     Developing with Your Module    You now have a module for working with albums. If you would like to use it in multiple proj- ects, you could copy it to the node_modules  folder of your other projects, but then you would  have a problem: What happens when you want to make a change to your albums module? Do  you have to copy the source code over to all the locations it is being used each and every time  you change it?     Fortunately,  npm   comes to the rescue here. You can modify the package.json file to add the  following:     { "name": "album-manager",   "version": "1.0.0",  "main": ". lib albums.js",   "private": true   }     This code tells  npm   to never accidentally publish this to the live  npm   repository, which you  don’t want for this module now.     Now you can use the  npm link   command, which tells  npm   to put a link to the album-manager  package in the local machine’s default public package repository  such as  usr local lib node_ modules on Linux and Mac machines, or C:\Users\ username \AppData\location\npm  on Windows .      102  Chapter 5  Modules  Kimidori:Chapter05 marcw$  cd album_mgr Kimidori:album_mgr marcw$  sudo npm link  usr local lib node_modules album-manager ->  Users marcw src scratch Chapter05 album_mgr     Note that depending on how the permissions and such are set up on your local machine, you  might need to run this command as super-user with  sudo .     Now, to consume this module, you need to do two things:       1.    2.     Refer to  'album-manager'   instead of  'album_mgr'   in the code  because  npm   uses the  name   field in package.json .        Create a reference to the album-manager module with  npm   for each project that wants to  use it. You can just type  npm link album-manager:     Kimidori:Chapter05 marcw$  mkdir test_project  Kimidori:Chapter05 marcw$  cd test_project   Kimidori:test_project marcw$  npm link album-manager  Users marcw src scratch Chapter05 test_project node_modules album-manager ->         usr local lib node_modules album-manager ->    Users marcw src scratch Chapter05 album_mgr  Kimidori:test_project marcw$  dir  drwxr-xr-x   3 marcw  staff  102 11 20 18:38 node_modules  Kimidori:test_project marcw$  dir node_modules   lrwxr-xr-x  1 marcw  staff   41 11 20 18:38 album-manager@ ->       usr local lib node_modules album-manager     Now, you are free to make changes to your original album manager source, and all referencing  projects will see changes right away.     Publishing Your Modules    If you have written a module that you would like to share with other users, you can publish it  to the official  npm   registry using  npm publish . This requires you to do the following:                    Remove the  "private": true   line from the package.json file.        Create an account on the  npm   registry servers with  npm adduser .        Optionally, choose to fill in more fields in the package.json  run  npm help json   to  get more information on which fields you might want to add  with things such as a  description, author contact information, and host website.        Finally, run  npm publish   from the module directory to push it to  npm . That’s it!

However, there is one module you can install from  npm   that you will use in pretty much every  single project you write. As such, it deserves its own section here.      104  Chapter 5  Modules  The Problem    Consider the case in which you want to write some asynchronous code to                    Open a handle to a path.        Determine whether or not the path points to a file.        Load in the contents of the file if the path does point to a file.        Close the file handle and return the contents to the caller.     You’ve seen almost all this code before, and the function to do this looks something like the  following, where functions you call are bold and the callback functions you write are bold  and italic:     var fs = require 'fs' ;  function load_file_contents path, callback  {      fs.open  path, 'r',  function    err, f  {        if  err  {            callback err ;            return;        } else if  !f  {            callback { error: "invalid_handle",                       message: "bad file handle from fs.open"} ;            return;        }         fs.fstat  f,  function    err, stats  {            if  err  {                callback err ;                return;            }            if   stats.isFile     {                var b = new Buffer 10000 ;                 fs.read  f, b, 0, 10000, null,  function    err, br, buf  {                    if  err  {                        callback err ;                        return;                    }   A Module So Common It Should Be Built In  105                      fs.close  f,  function    err  {                        if  err  {                            callback err ;                            return;                        }                        callback null, b.toString 'utf8', 0, br  ;                    } ;                } ;            } else {                callback { error: "not_file",                          message: "Can't load directory" } ;                return;            }        } ;    } ;  }     As you can, even for a short, contrived example such as this, the code is starting to nest pretty  seriously and deeply. Nest more than a few levels deep, and you’ll find that you cannot fit your  code in an 80-column terminal or one page of printed paper any more. It can also be quite  difficult to read the code, figure out what variables are being used where, and determine the  flow of the functions being called and returned.     The Solution    To solve this problem, you can use an  npm   module called  async . Async provides an intuitive  way to structure and organize asynchronous calls and removes many, if not all, of the tricky  parts of asynchronous programming you encounter in Node.js.     Executing Code in Serial    You can execute code serially in async in two ways: through the  waterfall   function and the  series   function  see  Figure    5.1        .  The  waterfall   function takes an array of functions and executes them one at a time, passing  the results from each function to the next. At the end, a resulting function is called with the  results from the final function in the array. If an error is signaled at any step of the way, execu- tion is halted, and the resulting function is called with an error instead.      106  Chapter 5  Modules  function 2  cb   E  r r o r  async.waterfall  function 1  cb   …  function n  cb   Results function   err, results   Figure 5.1      Serial execution with async.waterfall     For example, you could easily rewrite the previous code cleanly  it’s in the GitHub source tree   using  async.waterfall :     var fs = require 'fs' ; var async = require 'async' ;  function load_file_contents path, callback  {      async.waterfall  [         function    callback  {            fs.open path, 'r', callback ;        },           the f  file handle  was passed to the callback at the end of           the fs.open function call. async passes all params to us.         function    f, callback  {            fs.fstat f, function  err, stats  {                if  err                        abort and go straight to resulting function                    callback err ;   A Module So Common It Should Be Built In  107                 else                       f and stats are passed to next in waterfall                    callback null, f, stats ;            } ;        },         function    f, stats, callback  {            if  stats.isFile    {                var b = new Buffer 10000 ;                fs.read f, b, 0, 10000, null, function  err, br, buf  {                    if    err                         callback err ;                    else                           f and string are passed to next in waterfall                        callback null, f, b.toString 'utf8', 0, br  ;                } ;            } else {                callback { error: "not_file",                           message: "Can't load directory" } ;            }        },         function    f, contents, callback  {            fs.close f, function  err  {                if  err                     callback err ;                else                    callback null, contents ;            } ;        }    ]         this is called after all have executed in success         case, or as soon as there is an error.    ,  function    err, file_contents  {        callback err, file_contents ;    } ;  }           Although the code has grown a little bit in length, when you organize the functions serially in  an array like this, the code is significantly cleaner looking and easier to read.     The  async.series   function differs from the  async.waterfall   in two keys ways:        Results from one function are not passed to the next; instead, they are collected in an   array, which becomes the “results”  the second  parameter to the final resulting function.  Each step of the serial call gets one slot in this results array.        You can pass an object to  async.series , and it enumerates the keys and executes the   functions assigned to them. In this case, the results are not passed as an array, but an  object with the same keys as the functions called.      108  Chapter 5  Modules  Consider this example:     var async = require "async" ;  async.series    {      numbers :  function    callback  {        setTimeout function    {            callback null, [ 1, 2, 3 ] ;        }, 1500 ;    },     strings :  function    callback  {        setTimeout function    {            callback null, [ "a", "b", "c" ] ;        }, 2000 ;    }  }, function    err, results  {    console.log results ;  } ;     This function generates the following output:     { numbers: [ 1, 2, 3 ], strings: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] }     var async = require "async" ;  async.parallel    {      numbers :  function    callback  {        setTimeout function    {            callback null, [ 1, 2, 3 ] ;        }, 1500 ;    },     strings :  function    callback  {        setTimeout function    {            callback null, [ "a", "b", "c" ] ;        }, 2000 ;    }  }, function    err, results  {    console.log results ;  } ;     Executing in Parallel    In the previous  async.series   example, there was no reason to use a serial execution sequence  for the functions; the second function did not depend on the results of the first, so they could  have executed in parallel  see  Figure    5.2    . For this, async provides  async.parallel , as follows:      A Module So Common It Should Be Built In  109  async.parallel  function 1  cb   function 2  cb   function n  cb   …  Error  Results function   err, results   Figure 5.2      Parallel execution with async.parallel     This function generates the exact same output as before.     Mixing It Up    The most powerful function of them all is the  async.auto   function, which lets you mix  ordered and unordered functions together into one powerful sequence of functions. In this,  you pass an object where keys contain either        A function to execute, or              An array of dependencies and then a function to execute. These dependencies are   strings and are the names of properties in the object provided to  async.auto . The  auto function waits for these dependencies to finish executing before calling the provided  function.     The  async.auto   function figures out the required order to execute all the functions, including  which can be executed in parallel and which need to wait for others  see  Figure    5.3    . As with  the  async.waterfall   function, you can pass results from one function to the next via the  callback   parameter:     var async = require "async" ;  async.auto    {      numbers :  function    callback  {        setTimeout function    {            callback null, [ 1, 2, 3 ] ;        }, 1500 ;    },   110  Chapter 5  Modules      strings :  function    callback  {        setTimeout function    {            callback null, [ "a", "b", "c" ] ;        }, 2000 ;    },       do not execute this function until  numbers   and  strings   are done        thus_far   is an object with  numbers   and  strings   as arrays.     assemble : [ 'numbers', 'strings',  function    callback, thus_far  {        callback null, {            numbers: thus_far.numbers.join ",  " ,            strings: "'" + thus_far.strings.join "',  '"  + "'"        } ;    }]  },    this is called at the end when all other functions have executed. Optional function    err, results  {     if  err         console.log err ;    else        console.log results ;  } ;     async.auto:  label 1  cb   label 2  cb   E  r r o r  label 3  cb  – waits for label 1 + label 2  Results function   err, results   Figure 5.3      Mixing execution models with async.auto      A Module So Common It Should Be Built In  111  The  results   parameter passed to the final resulting function is an object in which the proper- ties hold the results of each of the functions executed on the object:     { numbers: [ 1, 2, 3 ],   strings: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ],  assemble: { numbers: '1,  2,  3', strings: '\'a\',  \'b\',  \'c\'' } }     Looping Asynchronously    In  Chapter    3   , I showed you how you can use the following pattern to iterate over the items in  an array with asynchronous function calls:      function iterator i  {   if  i < array.length   {     async_work  function  {       iterator  i + 1       }   } else {    callback results ;  }  }  0 ;     Although this technique works great and is indeed gloriously geeky, it’s a bit more complicated  than I’d like. Async comes to the rescue again with  async.forEachSeries . It iterates over  every element in the provided array, calling the given function for each. However, it waits for  each to finish executing before calling the next in the series:     async.forEachSeries      arr,       called for each element in arr    function  element, callback  {            use element         callback null ;     YOU MUST CALL ME FOR EACH ELEMENT!    },       called at the end    function  err  {           was there an error?  err will be non-null then    }   ;     To simply loop over every element in a loop and then have async wait for all of them to  finish, you can use  async.forEach , which is called in the exact same way and differs in that it  doesn’t execute the functions serially.     Async contains a ton of other functionality and is truly one of the indispensible modules of  Node.js programming today. I highly encourage you to browse the documentation at  https:   github.com caolan async   and play around with it. It truly takes the already-enjoyable Node.js  programming environment and makes it even better.      112  Chapter 5  Modules  Summary    In this chapter, you were more formally introduced to modules in Node.js. Although you have  seen them before, you now finally know how they’re written, how Node finds them for inclu- sion, and how to use  npm   to find and install them. You can write your own complex modules  now with package.json files and link them across your projects or even publish them for others  to use via  npm .     Finally, you are now armed with knowledge of async, one of the most powerful and cool  modules that you will use in nearly every single Node project you write from now on.     Next up: Putting the “web” back in web servers. You look at some cool ways to use JSON and  Node in your web apps and how to handle some other core Node technologies such as events  and streams.      6  Expanding Your Web Server     In this last chapter of Part II, “Learning to Run,” you expand the web server a little bit with   some key new functionality; you learn how to serve up static content such as HTML pages,  JavaScript files, cascading style sheets, and even image files. Armed with this knowledge, you  turn your focus away from the server and look at programming the client.     In the new Node.js world of programming websites, you’re going to migrate from the tradi- tional model of generating HTML on the server before sending it down to clients, and instead  have your server serve up only static files or JSON. The web browser can then use AJAX calls  along with template libraries to generate pages on the fly as the user navigates around the site.  Finally, you look at uploading files to your servers and see some of the tools you can use to  help make that task easier.     Begin by taking a look at Node.js  streams .     Serving Static Content with Streams    In the asynchronous, nonblocking IO world of Node.js, you previously saw that you can use  fs.open   and  fs.read   in a loop to read the contents of a file. However, Node.js provides  another, far more elegant mechanism for reading  and even writing  files called  streams . They  act an awful lot like UNIX pipes—even on Windows—and you briefly saw them in use in the  section “Receiving JSON POST Data” in  Chapter    4   , “Writing Simple Applications,” when you  needed to load in the data users sent along with requests.     In the basic usage, you use the  on   method to add  listeners   to  events . The provided functions are  called whenever one of those events is triggered. The  readable   event is sent whenever a read  stream has read something in for you to process. The  end   event is sent whenever a stream has  nothing more to read, and  error   events are sent whenever something has gone wrong.      114  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server  Reading a File    As a simple example, write the following code and save it to simple_stream.js:     var fs = require 'fs' ; var contents;     INCEPTION BWAAAAAAA!!!! var rs = fs.createReadStream "simple_stream.js" ;  rs.on ' readable ',  function      {     var str;    var d = rs.read  ;    if  d  {        if  typeof d == 'string'  {            str = d;        } else if  typeof d == 'object' && d instanceof Buffer  {            str = d.toString 'utf8' ;        }        if  str  {            if  !contents                 contents = d;            else                contents += str;        }    }  } ;  } ;     rs.on  'end' ,  function      {     console.log "read in the file contents: " ;    console.log contents.toString 'utf8'  ;  If you’re looking at the preceding code  it creates an object, adds two listeners, and then does... seemingly nothing  and wondering why it doesn’t just exit before the loading is done, recall in  Chapter    3   , “Asynchronous Programming,” I said that Node runs in an event loop waiting for  things to happen and executing code when something finally does happen.     Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes to Streams    Streams underwent a major change for the 0.10 series of Node.js releases. Up until that ver- sion, they had been pretty functional but were broken in a couple of key ways related to timing  and pausing. After years of putting it off, the Node core team finally resolved to fix these issues  and risk breaking a few apps here and there.    In the old world, to work with read streams, you added a  data   event listener and had that data  read by that stream passed as an argument to your callback. In the new world, you listen to the    Serving Static Content with Streams  115  readable   event instead and call the  read   method on the stream when it informs you that data  is ready for reading.    If you see any code that still uses the old  data   event, you shouldn’t have to worry; it’s 99  percent likely to be compatible with the new model, but I just wanted to make you aware that  you’ll be seeing both models for the next little while.     Well, part of this is knowing when events are  pending   or going to happen, such as the case in  which you have a read stream open and it actually has calls to the file system waiting to finish  reading in content. As long as there is something that is expected to happen, Node does not  exit until all those events are finished and user code  if there is any  is executed.     The preceding example creates a new read stream given a path with the  fs.createReadStream function. It then simply reads itself and prints the contents to the output stream. When it  gets a  readable   event, it calls the  read   method on the stream and gets back whatever data is  currently available. If no data is returned, it just waits until another  readable   event comes in  or an  end   event is received.     Manipulating Binary Data with Buffers    Thus far in your Node.js experience, you have been using strings, typically UTF-8 strings, to do  your work. However, when working with streams and files, you actually work mostly with the  Buffer   class.    Buffers work more or less as you’d expect them to: They hold binary data that can be converted  into other formats, used in operations to file writes, or broken apart and reassembled.    One critical point to remember about buffers is that the  length   property on the object does not  return the size of the content, but that of the buffer itself! For example:     var b = new Buffer 10000 ; var str = " b.write str ;    default is utf8, which is what we want console.log  b.length  ;    will print 10000 still!      ";  Node.js does not keep track of what you have written to which place in the buffer, so you must  keep track of these things yourself.    Sometimes a string does not have the same byte length as the number of characters—for  example, the preceding string  "    " .  Buffer.byteLength   returns the former:     console.log  str.length  ;                    prints 5 console.log  Buffer.byteLength str   ;        prints 15     To convert a buffer to a string, you should use the  toString   method. You will almost always  have it convert to UTF-8 strings:     console.log buf.toString 'utf8'  ;      116  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server  To append one buffer to the end of another, you can use the  concat   method, as follows:     var b1 = new Buffer "My name is " ; var b2 = new Buffer "Marc" ; var b3 = Buffer.concat [ b1, b2 ] ; console.log b3.toString 'utf8'  ;     Finally, you can “zero out” or otherwise fill in all the values in the buffer by using the  fill method, such as  buf.fill "\0"  .     Serving Static Files in a Web Server with Buffers    For this next exercise, write a little web server that serves up static content  an HTML file  using  Node buffers. You start with the  handle_incoming_request   function:     function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {     if  req.method.toLowerCase   == 'get'        && req.url.substring 0, 9  == ' content '  {        serve_static_file req.url.substring 9 , res ;    } else {        res.writeHead 404, { "Content-Type" : "application json" } ;         var out = { error: "not_found",                    message: "'" + req.url + "' not found" };        res.end JSON.stringify out  + "\n" ;    }  }     If an incoming request requests  content something.html, you try to serve that up by calling  the  serve_static_file   function. The design of the  http   module in Node.js is sufficiently  clever that the  ServerResponse   object you get to each request on your server is itself actually  a stream to which you can write your output! You do this writing by calling the  write   method  on the  Stream   class:     function  serve_static_file  file, res  {    var rs = fs.createReadStream file ;    var ct = content_type_for_path file ;    res.writeHead 200, { "Content-Type" : ct } ;     rs.on         ' readable ',         function      {            var d = rs.read  ;            if  d  {                if  typeof d == 'string'                     res.write d ;                else if  typeof d == 'object' && d instanceof Buffer    Serving Static Content with Streams  117                     res.write d.toString 'utf8'  ;            }        }     ;     rs.on          'end' ,         function      {            res.end  ;     we're done!!!        }     ;  function  content_type_for_path  file  {     return "text html";  }  }     The rest of the server’s code is as you have seen before:     var http = require 'http' ,     fs = require 'fs' ;  var s = http.createServer handle_incoming_request ; s.listen 8080 ;     node server.js     And then ask for that test.html using  curl :     curl -i -X GET http:  localhost:8080 content test.html     HTTP 1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 26 Nov 2012 03:13:50 GMT Connection: keep-alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked                       WooO!       Hello World!    Create a file called test.html with some simple HTML content in it; then run the server with     You should see output similar to the following  depending on what exactly you put in test. html :      118  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server  You are now able to serve up static content! But you have two problems. First, what happens  if you ask for  content blargle.html? In its current form, the script throws an error and termi- nates, which isn’t what you want. In this case, you want to return a 404 HTTP response code  and even maybe an error message.     To do this, you can listen to the  error   event on read streams. Add the following few lines to  the  serve_static_file   function:     rs.on    ;         'error' ,     function    e  {        res.writeHead 404, { "Content-Type" : "application json" } ;        var out = { error: "not_found",                    message: "'" + file + "' not found" };        res.end JSON.stringify out  + "\n" ;        return;    }  Now, when you get an error  after which no  data   or  end   events are called , you update the  response header code to 404, set a new  Content-Type , and return JSON with the error infor- mation that the client can use to report to the user what has happened.     Serving Up More Than Just HTML    The second problem is that you can currently serve up only HTML static content. The  content_type_for_path   function only ever returns  "text html" . It would be nice if it were a  bit more flexible, which you can accomplish as follows:     function  content_type_for_file    file  {     var ext = path.extname file ;    switch  ext.toLowerCase    {        case '.html': return "text html";        case ".js": return "text javascript";        case ".css": return 'text css';        case '.jpg': case '.jpeg': return 'image jpeg';        default: return 'text plain';    }  }     Now you can call the  curl   command with a number of different file types and should get the  expected results. For binary files such as JPEG images, you can use the  -o   flag to  curl   to tell  it to write the output to the specified filename. First, copy a JPEG to your current folder, run  server with  node server.js , and then add the following:     curl -o test.jpg http:  localhost:8080 content family.jpg     Chances are, you now have a file called test.jpg that is exactly what you expect it to be.      Serving Static Content with Streams  119  Shuffling data from stream   rs   in the preceding example  to stream   res   is such a common  scenario that the  Stream   class in Node.js has a convenience method to take care of all this for  you:  pipe . The  serve_static_file   function then becomes much simpler:     function  serve_static_file  file, res  {    var rs = fs.createReadStream file ;    rs.on          'error' ,         function    e  {            console.log "oh no! Error!! " + JSON.stringify e  ;            res.end "" ;        }     ;     var ct = content_type_for_path file ;    res.writeHead 200, { "Content-Type" : ct } ;       rs.pipe res ;   }     There is, unfortunately, one small problem with  pipe : It sends out HTTP response headers  as soon as you call it; after they are sent, you cannot subsequently call  ServerResponse. writeHead . If the file you want to read with  fs.createReadStream   does not exist, you  have no way to report it to the client. To get around this issue, you need to first check to see  whether the file exists and then perform the pipe operation:     function  serve_static_file  file, res  {    fs.exists file,  function    exists  {        if  !exists  {            res.writeHead 404, { "Content-Type" : "application json" } ;            var out = { error: "not_found",                        message: "'" + file + "' not found" };            res.end JSON.stringify out  + "\n" ;            return;        }         var rs = fs.createReadStream file ;        rs.on             'error',             function    e  {                res.end  ;            }         ;         var ct = content_type_for_file file ;        res.writeHead 200, { "Content-Type" : ct } ;        rs.pipe res ;    } ;  }      120  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server  Events    Streams are actually a subclass of the Node.js  Event   class, which provides all the functionality  for connecting and emitting events in your JavaScript files. You can inherit from this class to  create your own event firing classes. For this example, create a dummy downloader class that  fakes a remote download via a two-second  setTimeout   call:     var events = require 'events' ;  function Downloader    { } Downloader.prototype = new events.EventEmitter  ; Downloader.prototype.__proto__ = events.EventEmitter.prototype; Downloader.prototype.url = null; Downloader.prototype.download_url = function  path  {     var self = this;    self.url = path;      self.emit 'start', path ;       setTimeout function    {          self.emit 'end', path ;       }, 2000 ;  }  var d = new Downloader  ; d.on "start", function  path  {  } ; d.on "end", function  path  {     console.log "started downloading: " + path ;     console.log "finished downloading: " + path ;  } ; d.download_url "http:  marcwan.com" ;     You signal that an event has happened by using the  emit   method with the name of the event  and any arguments you would like passed to the listening function. You should make sure that  all possible code paths  including errors  signal an event; otherwise, your Node program  might hang.     Assembling Content on the Client: Templates    In more traditional web application models, the client sends an HTTP request to the server, the  server gathers all the data and generates the HTML response, and it sends that down as text.  While this way of doing things is very reasonable, it has a few key disadvantages:           It doesn’t take advantage of any of the computing power available on the average client   computer these days. Even the average mobile phone or tablet is multiple times more  powerful than PCs of 10 years ago.      Assembling Content on the Client: Templates  121           It makes your life more difficult when you have multiple types of clients. Some people   might access you through a web browser, others through mobile apps, even others  through desktop applications or third-party apps.        It’s frustrating to have to perform so many different types of things on the server. It   would be great if you could just have your server focus on processing, storing, and  generating data, and letting the client decide how to present the data.     An increasingly common way of doing things, and something I’ve found particularly compel- ling and fun with Node, is to convert the server back end to serve only JSON, or as absolutely  little of anything else as possible. The client app can then choose how to present the returned  data to the user. Scripts, style sheets, and even most HTML can be served from file servers or  content delivery networks  CDNs .     For web browser applications, you can use  client-side templates    see  Figure    6.1    . In this way of  doing things,       1.     The client downloads a skeleton HTML page with pointers to JavaScript files, CSS files,   and an empty  body   element from the Node server.       2.     One of the referenced JavaScript files is a  bootstrapper   that does all the work of gathering  everything and putting the page together. It is given the name of an HTML template and  a server JSON API to call. It downloads the template and then applies the returned JSON  data to that template file using a  template engine . You will use a template engine called  “Mustache”  see the sidebar “Template Engines” .       3.     The resulting HTML code is inserted into the body of the page, and all the server has to   do is serve up a little bit of JSON.      It has been in preparation for this that you have been developing the photo album applica- tion as a JSON-only server thus far. Although you will add the capability now for it to serve up  static files, this is largely for convenience and educational purposes; in a production environ- ment, you would probably move these files to a CDN and update the URLs to point to them as  appropriate.     Template Engines    A large number of client-side  and even server-side  template engines or libraries are available.  For the jQuery JavaScript library that you’re using most often in this book, there are a few such  as JSRender or jQote, both of which are just fine. There are others that don’t necessarily have  to fit in with your chosen JavaScript helper library as well.    For your purposes here,  they’re all about the same . The feature sets all tend to be roughly  equal, with similar ways of doing things and reasonably similar performance. When you are  choosing a library, I recommend just picking one that is actively being developed and or main- tained and that seems to have a reasonable syntax that you find comfortable.    For this book and many of my recent projects, I am using a template engine called  Mustache .  As I just said, this decision is semi-arbitrary but was helped by mustache.js      122  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server     Being a reasonably small and fast JavaScript library.       Being a feature-complete templating solution.                   Having a pretty cool name. Tags in Mustache are delimited by  {{   and  }} , which many  feel look like mustaches.     This solution is by no means perfect, but I suspect you’ll find Mustache has the right trade-offs  between features and speed for you, too. You are always encouraged to explore other solutions  and read one of the dozens of blog posts and tutorials for all the other packages.     Figure 6.1      Client-side page generation with templates     To convert your photo album to this new world of templates, you need to do the following:       1.     Generate the HTML skeleton for your pages.       2.     Add support to the app for serving static file content.       3.     Modify the list of supported URLs to add   pages    and   templates    for HTML pages  and templates, respectively.       4.     Write the templates and JavaScript files that load them.     Let’s go!      Assembling Content on the Client: Templates  123  The HTML Skeleton Page    Although you might attempt to do all HTML generation on the client, you cannot completely  avoid the server doing any at all; you still need it to send down the initial page skeleton that  the client can use to perform the rest of the generation.     For this example, you use a reasonably simple HTML page, which is saved as basic.html, shown  in  Listing 6.1 .     Listing 6.1      The Simple App Page Bootstrapper  basic.html               Photo Album              <link rel="stylesheet" href="http:  localhost:8080 content style.css"        type="text css"  >      <script src="http:  localhost:8080 content jquery-1.8.3.min.js"          type="text javascript">   <script src="http:  localhost:8080 content mustache.js"          type="text javascript">   <script src= "http:  localhost:8080 content {{PAGE_NAME}}.js"           type="text javascript">               This file is straightforward; it has a style sheet, and then you include jQuery and Mustache. The  last  script   tag is the most interesting: This file is the page  bootstrapper   that holds the code that  will download the template, get the JSON data from the server for the page, and generate the  HTML for the page based on these two things. You can see that it is set up with a parameter  {{PAGE_NAME}}   to replace with the actual page you will be loading at any given time.      124  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server  Serving Static Content    Now you are going to modify the application server’s folder layout a little bit as follows:     + project_root      + contents      JS, CSS, and HTML files    + templates     client-side HTML templates    + albums        the albums we've seen already     You’ve seen the albums folder before, but now you are going to add the contents and templates  folders to handle additional content you’re going to add.     The updated  handle_incoming_request   function looks something like the following. The  serve_static_file   function is identical to the one you just wrote in the preceding section:     function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {        parse the query params into an object and get the path       without them.  true for 2nd param means parse the params .    req.parsed_url = url.parse req.url, true ;    var core_url = req.parsed_url.pathname;        test this updated url to see what they're asking for    if  core_url.substring 0, 9  ==   ' content '    {        serve_static_file "content " + core_url.substring 9 , res ;    } else if  core_url ==   ' albums.json'    {        handle_list_albums req, res ;    } else if  core_url.substr 0, 7  ==   ' albums'                 && core_url.substr core_url.length - 5  ==   '.json'    {        handle_get_album req, res ;    } else {        send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource   ;    }  }              For example, in the content  folder, you start with three files:        jquery-1.8.3.min.js   —You can download this file directly from jquery.com. Most versions   of jQuery from the past couple of years should work just fine.        mustache.js   —You can download this file from a number of places. In this case, simply   use the generic mustache.js from github.com janl mustache.js. There are also some  server-side versions of mustache as well, which are not what we want for this chapter.        style.css   —You can just create this as an empty file or start to fill in CSS to modify the   pages that you’ll generate for the album app.     Modifying Your URL Scheme    The app server thus far supports only  albums.json and  albums  album_name .json. You can now  add support for static content, pages, and template files as follows:      Assembling Content on the Client: Templates  125   content   some_file.ext     pages   some_page_name [ optional junk]  templates    some_file.html     For content and template files, there are actually real files to download directly from the hard  disk. For page requests, however, you always return some variation on the basic.html you saw  in the previous section. It has the  {{PAGE_NAME}}   macro replaced with the name of the page  passed in through the URL; that is,  page  home.     The updated  handle_incoming_request   now looks as follows:     function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {        parse the query params into an object and get the path       without them.  true for 2nd param means parse the params .    req.parsed_url = url.parse req.url, true ;    var core_url = req.parsed_url.pathname;        test this fixed url to see what they're asking for    if  core_url.substring 0, 7  ==    ' pages '    {        serve_page req, res ;    } else if  core_url.substring 0, 11  ==   ' templates '    {        serve_static_file "templates " + core_url.substring 11 , res ;    } else if  core_url.substring 0, 9  ==   ' content '     {        serve_static_file "content " + core_url.substring 9 , res ;    } else if  core_url == ' albums.json'  {        handle_list_albums req, res ;    } else if  core_url.substr 0, 7  == ' albums'               && core_url.substr core_url.length - 5  == '.json'    {        handle_get_album req, res ;    } else {        send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource   ;    }  }      **  The  serve_page   function actually determines what page the client has asked for, fixes up the  basic.html template file, and sends the resulting HTML skeleton down to the browser:     * All pages come from the same one skeleton HTML file that * just changes the name of the JavaScript loader that needs to be * downloaded. *   function  serve_page  req, res  {     var core_url = req.parsed_url.pathname;    var page = core_url.substring 7 ;          remove  pages    126  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server        currently only support home!    if  page != 'home'  {        send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource   ;        return;    }     fs.readFile         'basic.html',         function    err, contents  {            if  err  {                send_failure res, 500, err ;                return;            }             contents = contents.toString 'utf8' ;                replace page name, and then dump to output.            contents = contents.replace   '{{PAGE_NAME}}'  , page ;            res.writeHead 200, { "Content-Type": "text html" } ;            res.end contents ;        }     ;  }     Instead of using  fs.createReadStream , you use  fs.readFile , which reads in the entire  contents of a file to a  Buffer . You have to convert this  Buffer   to a string, and then you can  fix up the contents so the right JavaScript loader is indicated. This approach is not recom- mended for large files because it wastes a lot of memory, but for something as short as this  basic.html file, it’s perfectly fine and convenient!     The JavaScript Loader Bootstrapper    The HTML pages are going to be quite simple, so you can start with a reasonably trivial  JavaScript loader. As you add more functionality later in the book, you make them a bit more  complicated, but  Listing    6.2   shows the one you can start with now, which you save as home.js.     Listing 6.2      The JavaScript Page Loader  home.js      $  function   {     var tmpl,      Main template HTML    tdata = {};     JSON data object that feeds the template        Initialize page    var initPage =  function    {   Assembling Content on the Client: Templates  127            Load the HTML template         $.get " templates home.html", function d {                        1             tmpl = d;        } ;            Retrieve the server data and then initialize the page         $.getJSON " albums.json", function  d  {                          2             $.extend tdata, d.data ;        } ;            When AJAX calls are complete parse the template           replacing mustache tags with vars        $ document .ajaxStop function    {             var renderedPage = Mustache.to_html tmpl, tdata ;             3             $ "body" .html renderedPage ;        }     }  ;  } ;     The  $ function    { ...   syntax is basically the same as  $ document .ready function     ...   in jQuery, just a bit shorter. So, this function is called after all the other resources  most  notably jQuery and Mustache  are loaded. It then does the following three things:       1.     It requests the template file, home.html from the server by calling the URL  tmpl home. html.       2.     It asks for the JSON data representing albums in the application,  albums.json.       3.     Finally, it gives these two things to Mustache to do its templating magic.     Templating with Mustache    The template engine I chose for the photo album app, Mustache, is easy to use, fast, and small.  Most interestingly, it has only tags, wrapped in  {{   and  }} , known as  mustaches . It does not  have any  if   statements or looping constructs. Tags act as a set of rules that play out depending  on the data you provide.     The basic usage of Mustache, which you saw in the preceding sections, is     var html_text = Mustache.to_html  template ,  data  ; $ "body" .html html_text ;     To print properties from an object, you use the following:     Mustache template:     The album "{{name}}" has {{photos.length}} photos.      128  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server   "name": "Italy2012",  "photos" : [ "italy01.jpg", "italy02.jpg" ]  The album "Italy2012" has 2 photos.     To apply a template over every item in a collection or array, you use the     character. For  example:      "albums" : [ { "name" : "italy2012" },               { "name" : "australia2010" },               { "name" : "japan2010" }]  JSON:  {  }     Output:     Mustache:  {albums}}    * {{name}} {{ albums}}     JSON:  {  }     Output:     * italy2012 * australia2010 * japan2010     Mustache:  {{albums}}    * {{name}}  {{ albums}} {{^albums}}  {{ albums}}     JSON:       Sorry, there are no albums yet.  { "albums" : [ ]  }     Output:     Sorry, there are no albums yet.     If you do not have any matching results, nothing is printed. You can capture this case by  adding the  ^   character:      Assembling Content on the Client: Templates  129  If the object after the     character isn’t a collection or array but just an object, the values from it  are used without iterating:     Mustache:     {{album}}  {{ album}}     JSON:     {  }     Output:     Mustache:     {{users}}  {{ users}}     JSON:     {  }     Output:      The album "{{name}}" has {{photos.length}} photos.   "album": {  "name": "Italy2012",              "photos" : [ "italy01.jpg", "italy02.jpg" ] }  The album "Italy2012" has 2 photos.     By default, all values are HTML escaped; that is,      are replaced with  &lt;   and  &gt; respectively, and so on. To tell Mustache not to do this, use the extra hairy Mustache triple  brackets,  {{{   and  }}} :       * {{name}} says {{{ saying }}}     * raw saying: {{ saying }}   "users" : [ { "name" : "Marc", "saying" : "I like  cats !" },              { "name" : "Bob", "saying" : "I  hate  cats" },  * Marc says I like  cats !   * raw saying: I like &lt;em&gt;cats&lt; em&gt;!  * Bob says I  hate  cats   * raw saying: I  &lt;b&gt;hate&lt; b&gt; cats     Your Home Page Mustache Template    Now, it’s time to write your first template for your home page, which you can save in home. html, shown in  Listing    6.3   .      130  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server  Listing 6.3      The Home Page Template File  home.html            There are {{ albums.length }} albums         {{albums}}                  {{name}}              {{ albums}}      {{^albums}}         Sorry, there are currently no albums       {{ albums}}           If you have any albums, this code iterates over each of them and provides an      element  with the name of the album and a link to the album page, accessed via the URL  page  album  album_name . When there are no albums, a simple message is printed instead.     Putting It All Together    I threw a lot of new stuff at you in the preceding sections, so stop now and make this all run.  You should now have the following file layout for your web application:     + project_root       server.js                                    GitHub source    basic.html                                    Listing    6.1        + content          home.js                                   Listing    6.2           album.js                                  Listing    6.5           jquery-1.8.3.min.js        mustache.js        style.css     + templates          home.html                                 Listing    6.3           album.html                                Listing    6.4     + albums           + whatever albums you want     The code for home.html and album.html, which we have not previously seen, are in  Listings  6.4   and    6.5   .      Assembling Content on the Client: Templates  131  To run this project, you should be able to type     node server.js     You can then switch to a web browser and browse to http:  localhost:8080 page home. If you  want to see what happens on the command line, try using  curl   as follows:     curl -i -X GET http:  localhost:8080 page home     Because  curl   executes no client-side JavaScript for you, the template and JSON date are not  loaded via Ajax, and you get only the basic HTML skeleton from basic.html.     Listing 6.4      Another Mustache Template Page  album.html          {{photos}}    There are {{ photos.length }} photos in this album                              <img style='width: 250px; height: 250px; background-color: fbb'               src="{{url}}" border="0" >           {{ desc }}                    {{ photos}}  {{^photos}}        This album doesn't have any photos in it, sorry.   {{ photos}}          Listing 6.5      Our Album Page Bootstrapper JavaScript File  album.js      $  function   {     var tmpl,      Main template HTML    tdata = {};     JSON data object that feeds the template        Initialize page    var initPage =  function    {   132  Chapter 6  Expanding Your Web Server            get our album name.        parts = window.location.href.split " " ;        var album_name = parts[5];            Load the HTML template        $.get " templates album.html", function d {            tmpl = d;        } ;            Retrieve the server data and then initialize the page        $.getJSON " albums " + album_name + ".json",  function    d  {            var photo_d = massage_album d ;            $.extend tdata, photo_d ;        } ;            When AJAX calls are complete parse the template           replacing mustache tags with vars        $ document .ajaxStop  function      {            var renderedPage = Mustache.to_html  tmpl, tdata  ;            $ "body" .html  renderedPage  ;        }     }  ;  function  massage_album  d  {     if  d.error != null  return d;    var obj = { photos: [] };     var af = d.data.album_data;  } ;  }        for  var i = 0; i < af.photos.length; i++  {        var url = " albums " + af.short_name + " " + af.photos[i].filename;        obj.photos.push { url: url, desc: af.photos[i].filename } ;    }    return obj;  If you’ve done everything correctly, you should see output something similar to that shown in  Figure    6.2   . It’s not pretty, but now you can start to play around with the template file and the  style.css file to really make the application yours!      Summary  133  Figure 6.2      The template-enabled JSON application running in the browser     Summary    This chapter introduced two key Node.js features, streams and events, that you used to serve up  static content from your web application. Equally importantly, this chapter introduced client- side template engines, and you used Mustache to put together a simple start to a front-end for  your photo album application.     You might have noticed, however, that some of the things you have been doing thus far  seem unnecessarily complicated, tedious, or possibly even worryingly bug-prone  the   handle_incoming_request   function in particular . It would be nice if there were some  further modules to help you keep track of things more easily.     It is thus that you are not going to develop the photo album much further in its current form,  but continue to look at some modules that will clean up your code significantly and allow  you to add features quickly and with little code. You will do so using the  Express  Application  Framework for Node  .      This page intentionally left blank    Part III  Writing Web Applications     7 Building Web Applications with Express    137     8 Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB       161     9 Databases II: SQL  MySQL     189      This page intentionally left blank    7  Building Web Applications  with Express     Thus far, you have been learning the fundamentals and core concepts of Node.js; armed with   these ideas, you have built some simple applications, although you’ve had to write a lot of  code to do some reasonably basic things. It’s time to change gears a bit and start building more  interesting web applications, using one of the biggest strengths of Node: the huge collection of  libraries and modules available to you through  npm . Now that you understand the core work- ings of Node and modules, it’s time to start finding ways to make your life significantly easier  and your development much faster.     In this chapter, you start working with  express , a web application framework for Node. It takes  care of many of the basic tasks you learned about in previous chapters, and even exposes some  powerful new functionality that you can take advantage of in your apps. I show you how to  build apps with express and update your photo album app to use it. Then you look a bit more  at application design, learn how to expose the API from your JSON server, and explore some  new functionality you haven’t seen before.     Installing Express    In this chapter, you are going to slowly change the way you install applications via  npm . You  might expect that, to install express, you’d just type     npm install express     and this would work just fine. However, it always installs the latest version of the express node  module, which you might not want when you’re deploying your application to live production  servers. When you develop and test against a particular version, it’s good to have that same  version run on the live servers. Only after you update to a newer version and fully test against  that do you want to use that new version on the live servers.      138  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  So, the basic methodology for building Node applications is now as follows:       1.     Create an application folder.       2.     Write a package.json file describing the package and stating which  npm   modules are  needed.       3.     Run  npm install   to make sure these modules are installed properly.     So, create a new folder called trivial_express  for your express test application and then put the  following into package.json in that folder:      "name": "Express-Demo",  "description": "Demonstrates Using Express and Connect",  "version": "0.0.1",  "private": true,  "dependencies": {    "express": "3.x"  } }     The  name   and  description   fields are reasonably self-explanatory, and the app is just a toy  right now, so it has an appropriate version number. As you saw in  Chapter    5   , “Modules,”  you can set  private   to  true , which tells  npm   never to try installing it in the live  npm   registry  because it is just a test project for your own use.     After creating the file, you can run the following to read in the dependencies section and install  all the appropriate modules:     npm install     Because express itself depends on many different modules, you see a decent amount of output  before it exits, but then your node_modules  folder should be ready to go. If you ever make a  change to your package.json, you can just run  npm update   to make sure all the modules are  correctly installed.     Hello World in Express    Recall from  Chapter    1   , “Getting Started,” that your first web server in Node.js was roughly like  the following:     var http = require "http" ;  function  process_request  req, res  {     res.end "Hello World" ;  var s = http.createServer process_request ; s.listen 8080 ;     {  }   Routing and Layers in Express  139  Well, in express, it looks quite similar:     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.get ' ',  function  req, res {   res.end 'hello world' ;  } ;  app.listen 8080 ;     Save that, run it, and then either run  curl   or localhost:8080 in the web browser, and you  should get the  hello world   output you expect. One of the great things about express is that  it  is built on top of everything you have seen so far , so the HTTP request and response objects  have the same methods and properties they had before. To be certain, they have many new  things added that make them more interesting and powerful, but you are not operating in a  completely new world here—just an extended version of the one with which you are already  familiar and   comfortable!     Routing and Layers in Express    Express is built on top of a Node module called  connect . Connect is what is known as a  middle- ware   library that provides a collection of common functions that network applications might  need. At the heart of this model is the concept of a flow of functions, or what some people like  to describe as a  layered   set of functions.     Middleware: What’s in a Name?    When you run into the term  middleware   for the first time, you can be forgiven for being worried  that you’ve missed out on some key new concept or technology shift. Fortunately, it’s nothing  so complicated.    Effectively, middleware originally was used to describe software components  typically on the  server side of things  that connected two things together, such as a business logic layer and a  database server, or storage services with application modules, and so on.    Over time, however, the term seems to have become more generic and broad, and now seems  to cover any piece of software that connects two things together in some way, shape, or form.    For the purposes of this book, the middleware exposed by  connect   that you see in  express   is  basically just a collection of modules that allow your web apps to seamlessly integrate function- ality from either the server or browser.     You set up your application by creating a sequence of functions  layers  through which express  navigates. When one decides that it wants to take over, it can complete the processing and stop  the sequence. Express then walks back up through the sequence to the end.  Some layers do  their process “on the way in,” others “on the way out.”     140  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  So, in the preceding express application, there is only one layer in the sequence:     app.get ' ',  function  req, res { } ;     This function, which is a helper provided by express, processes the incoming request  by calling  the provided function  if the following are both true:              The HTTP request method is  GET .        The requested URL is    .     If the incoming request does not match these criteria, the function is not called. If no func- tion matches the requested URL—for example, browse or  curl   to  some other url—express just  gives a default response:     Cannot GET  some other url     Routing Basics    The general format of the URL routing functions is as follows:     app.  method   url_pattern ,  optional_functions ,  request_handler_function  ;     The preceding route handler is for handling GET requests for the URL  . To support handling  a POST request on a particular URL, you can use the  post   method on the express application  object:     app.post " forms update_user_info.json",  function    req, res  { ... } ;     Similarly, express supports  DELETE   and  PUT   methods, both of which you use in the photo- sharing application, via the  delete   and  put   methods, respectively. Alternately, you can use the  all   method to indicate that the routing function should accept the given URL with any given  HTTP method:     app.all " users marcwan.json",  function    req, res  { ... } ;     The first parameter to the routing function is a regular expression to match an incoming  request URL. It can be simple as follows:      path to resources      user s ? list      users *     Or it can contain regular expression features, such as     which matches both  users list and  user list, while     matches anything starting with  users .      Routing and Layers in Express  141  One of the most powerful features of routing is the ability to use  placeholders   to extract named  values from the requested route, marked by the colon   :    character. When the route is parsed,  express puts the matched placeholders on the  req.params   object for you. For example:     app.get " albums :album_name.json",  function    req, res  {     res.end "Requested " + req.params.album_name ;  } ;     If you call the preceding app requesting  albums italy2012.json, you get the following output:     Requested italy2012.     You can put multiple parameters in the same URL as well:     app.get " albums :album_name photos :photo_id.json", function  req, res  { ...  ;     If your function is called,  req.params   has both  album_name   and  photo_id   set with the appro- priate incoming values. Placeholders match any sequence of characters except for forward  slashes.     The function you provide to the routing method is given the request and response object, as  you have seen. However, it is also given a third parameter, which you are free to use or ignore.  It is usually labeled  next    the flow of the layered functions is always continued through func- tions called  next  , and gives you the opportunity to do some additional examinations on the  incoming URL and still choose to ignore it, as follows:     app.get " users :userid.json",  function    req, res, next  {     var uid = parseInt req.params.userid ;    if  uid < 2000000000  {        next  ;                 don't want it. Let somebody else process it.    } else {        res.end get_user_info uid  ;    } } ;     Updating Your Photo Album App for Routing    The photo album app is quite easy to adapt to express. You have to do only a few things to get  it working:                    Create a package.json and install express.        Replace the http module’s server with that of express.        Replace the  handle_incoming_request   function with routing handlers.        Update the way you get query parameters in express.  They are placed on  req.query   for   your convenience.       142  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  Now copy the last version of the photo app you created at the end of  Chapter    6   , “Expanding  Your Web Server,” to a new folder  you can call it basic_routing   and place the following  package.json inside:     You can run  npm install   to make sure express and async are installed to node_modules . You  can then change the top of the server.js file to use express instead of the http module:     {   "name": "Photo-Sharing",  "description": "Our Photo Sharing Application",  "version": "0.0.2",  "private": true,  "dependencies": {    "async": "0.1.x",    "express": "3.x"  } }     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  var path = require "path" ,     async = require 'async' ;    fs = require 'fs' ;     And you change     http.listen 8080 ;     to     app.listen 8080 ;     Next, you have to replace the  handle_incoming_request   function, which looks as follows:     function  handle_incoming_request  req, res  {     req.parsed_url = url.parse req.url, true ;    var core_url = req.parsed_url.pathname;        test this fixed url to see what they're asking for    if  core_url.substring 0, 7  == ' pages '  {        serve_page req, res ;    } else if  core_url.substring 0, 11  == ' templates '  {        serve_static_file "templates " + core_url.substring 11 , res ;    } else if  core_url.substring 0, 9  == ' content '  {        serve_static_file "content " + core_url.substring 9 , res ;    } else if  core_url == ' albums.json'  {        handle_list_albums req, res ;    } else if  core_url.substr 0, 7  == ' albums'               && core_url.substr core_url.length - 5  == '.json'  {   Routing and Layers in Express  143         handle_get_album req, res ;    } else {        send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource   ;    }  }     }     You replace it with these routing functions:     app.get   ' albums.json'  , handle_list_albums ; app.get   ' albums :album_name.json'  , handle_get_album ; app.get   ' content :filename'  ,  function    req, res  {     serve_static_file 'content ' + req.params.filename, res ;  } ; app.get   ' templates :template_name'  ,  function    req, res  {     serve_static_file "templates " + req.params.template_name, res ;  } ; app.get   ' pages :page_name'  , serve_page ; app.get  '*' , four_oh_four ;  function  four_oh_four  req, res  {     send_failure res, 404, invalid_resource   ;  Not only do the routing functions seem much cleaner and simpler than the previous func- tion you had, but it is much easier to see the URLs that will be matched and how the app will  function. You added a new route matching  "*"   so that all other requests will be given a  404 response.     There is one problem with the routing functions right now, however. What happens if the user  asks for    pages album italy2012? Currently, the app will fail: The regular expression matching  for parameters never includes forward slash       characters, so the route   pages :page_name does not match. To solve this problem, you must add the extra route:     app.get   ' pages :page_name :sub_page'  , serve_page ;     Now all the pages will route to the correct function, and you have also set yourself up to  quickly identify the subpage being requested.     One of the nice things about the app now is that you no longer need to parse the incoming  requests or parameters; express does all this for you. So, whereas before you had to include  the  url   module to parse the incoming URL, it’s now ready for you right when you get to the  routing functions. Similarly, you never need to parse  GET   query parameters because they are  also prepared for you in advance. So you can update the small helper functions as follows:     function  get_album_name  req  {     return req.params.album_name;  } function  get_template_name  req  {     return req.params.template_name;  }   144  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  function  get_query_params  req  {     return req.query;  } function  get_page_name  req  {     return req.params.page_name;  }     With those changes, the photo sharing app should be updated and ready to go with express. It  should behave exactly like the old one.     REST API Design and Modules    When you are designing JSON servers such as the one you are writing, it is important to spend  some time thinking about the API and how clients will use it. Spending some time up front to  design a good API helps you to think about how people will use the application and also helps  you organize and refactor the code to reflect this conceptual understanding.     API Design    For the photo-sharing JSON server, you are developing what’s called a RESTful JSON server. The  word REST comes from  Representational State Transfer , and basically implies that you can request  an accurate representation of an object from the server. REST APIs focus on four core operations   which, coincidentally, map to four HTTP request methods :        Creation   PUT          Retrieval   GET          Updating   POST          Destruction   DELETE                      Some people refer to these operations as  CRUD , and pretty much everything you do in your  API centers around doing one of these things to objects, whether they are albums, photos,  comments, or users. Although it is not possible to design the perfect API, I will do my absolute  best to help you design one that is at least extremely intuitive and doesn’t leave the client  authors scratching their heads as to what you intended. Here are some principles to follow  when designing RESTful interfaces:        There are two basic kinds of URLs. Most URLs you design will be a variation on   these two:     1.     Collections—for example,  albums.     2.     Specific items within these collections—for example,  albums italy2012.      REST API Design and Modules  145                                                     Collections should be nouns, specifically a plural noun, such as  albums ,  users , or  photos .        PUT  albums.json —The HTTP request body contains the JSON with the data for   the new album.     GET   or  POST , respectively:        You fetch or update an object by specifying the specific instance on the collection with      GET  albums italy2012.json —The request returns this album.        POST  albums italy2012.json —The HTTP request body contains the JSON with   the new data for this album.        You destroy objects with  DELETE .        DELETE  albums italy2012.json —Destroys this album.        If you have collections off collections, for example, photos associated with albums, you   just continue the pattern:        GET  albums italy2012 photos.json —Returns all the photos in this album.        PUT  albums italy2012 photos.json —Adds a new photo to this collection.        GET  albums italy2012 photos 23482938424.json —Fetches the photo with   the given ID.        Slight changes to the way in which you get data from these collections, such as   pagination or filtering, should all be done via  GET   query parameters:        GET  albums.json?located_in=Europe —Fetches only those albums in Europe.        GET  albums japan2010 photos.json?page=1&page_size=25 —Fetches the   given page of 25 photos for the japan2010 album.        You version the API so that if you want to make major changes to it in future versions   that would not be compatible, you can simply update the version number. You prefix the  API URLs with  v1  for this first version.        Finally, you suffix all your URLs that return JSON with .json so that clients know what   data will be in the responses. In the future, you could also add support for .xml or  whatever other formats you want.     With this in mind, the new API for the photo-sharing application centers around albums. It  looks as follows:      v1 albums.json  v1 albums :album_name.json   pages :page_name  templates :template_name  content :filename      146  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  Why don’t you put version numbers on the static content URLs? Because they’re not part of  the JSON server interface, but instead are helpers to provide the contents for the web browser  client. Users always get the latest version of this and thus get code that knows how to use the  correct version of the API.     It should be trivial for you to update the server.js file with this API design change. Don’t forget  to also update the bootstrapping JavaScript files in  content  with the new URLs as well! Give  that a try before continuing onward.     Modules    With the APIs updated around the new REST interface, you can take advantage of some of the  clarity you have given to the application. You now have clear functionality boundaries around  albums and pages, so you can put those areas of functionality into their own modules.     Create a subfolder of the application folder called handlers  and put the new modules in there.  For albums, create a file in that folder called albums.js and move the four album manipulation  functions into that file. You can view the source for this project in the GitHub under the folder  named handlers_as_modules . Effectively, all you are doing is taking the code for the functions  handle_get_album   and  handle_list_albums   and putting them, along with their accompany- ing helper functions  load_album   and  load_album_list , into the new module. Take a look at  this for a minute and see how easy it is to reorganize the code quickly.     Recall that the server.js file has a few functions to help you extract album names and query  parameters and the like. You can get rid of them and just put the appropriate member refer- ences for  req.params   and  req.query   in the right place.     There are also a few functions to help you simplify sending success and error codes, such as  send_success ,  send_failure , and  invalid_resource . You can put them into their own  module called helpers.js in the handlers  directory. You refer to this at the top of the albums.js  file, and the contents are shown in  Listing    7.1   .     Listing 7.1      Helper Functions  helpers.js      exports.version = '0.1.0';  exports. make_error   = function err, msg  {     var e = new Error msg ;    e.code = err;    return e;  }  }  exports. send_success   = function res, data  {     res.writeHead 200, {"Content-Type": "application json"} ;    var output = { error: null, data: data };    res.end JSON.stringify output  + "\n" ;   REST API Design and Modules  147  exports. send_failure   = function res, code, err  {     var code =  err.code  ? err.code : err.name;    res.writeHead code, { "Content-Type" : "application json" } ;    res.end JSON.stringify { error: code, message: err.message }  + "\n" ;  }  }  }     exports. invalid_resource   = function   {     return make_error "invalid_resource",                      "the requested resource does not exist." ;  exports. no_such_album   = function   {     return make_error "no_such_album",                      "The specified album does not exist" ;  Now, when you want to refer to the album functions, you add the following  require   to the  top of server.js:     var album_hdlr = require '. handlers albums.js' ;     And then you can update the routing handlers for the album functions to be as follows:     app.get ' v1 albums.json',  album_hdlr.list_all  ; app.get ' v1 albums :album_name.json',  album_hdlr.album_by_nam e ;     Similarly, you can move the functionality to build pages into the handlers  directory in a  file called pages.js, as in  Listing    7.2   . This task really only involves moving the  serve_page function.     Listing 7.2      Building Pages  pages.js      var helpers = require '. helpers.js' ,     fs = require 'fs' ;  exports.version = "0.1.0";  exports. generate   = function  req, res  {     var page = req.params.page_name;     fs.readFile         'basic.html',         function    err, contents  {            if  err  {                send_failure res, 500, err ;                return;            }   148  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express             contents = contents.toString 'utf8' ;                replace page name, and then dump to output.            contents = contents.replace   '{{PAGE_NAME}}'  , page ;            res.writeHead 200, { "Content-Type": "text html" } ;            res.end contents ;        }     ;  };     You can then update the routing handler for pages, as follows:     var page_hdlr = require '. handlers pages.js' ; app.get ' v1 pages :page_name',  page_hdlr.generate  ;     After all is said and done, the server.js file has left only the functions for serving static content,  which you can view in the GitHub source for  Chapter    7, “Building Web Applications with  Express,”   in the handlers_as_modules  project folder.     The application should have the same functionality as before, but is now much more modular- ized and is easier to read and follow along. You now also have an idea for how you can add  functionality to it as you proceed.     Additional Middleware Functionality    I’ve mentioned before that express is built on top of the  connect   middleware library. These  components chain together and are given every incoming request one at a time until one of  them decides to process it and ceases calling the provided  next   function. The routing handlers  form part of this chain. Express and connect come with a number of other useful components,  so let’s spend a while reviewing some of the more interesting ones.     Usage    You use middleware components in express and connect with the  use   method. For example, to  use the  logging   middleware, you would write the following:     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.use express.logger   ;  * etc ... *      The  express.logger   function that you call returns a function that will form part of the filter  layering in your application. Express comes with a number of components built in, but you are  allowed to use any compatible middleware component. You can use any of those provided by  connect  provided you’ve added it to the  dependencies   section of your package.json file :      Additional Middleware Functionality  149  var express = require 'express' ; var connect = require 'connect' ; var app = express  ;  app.use connect.compress   ;  * etc ... *      var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.use express.compress   ;  * etc ... *      Because adding and importing connect only for this is a hassle, express actually re-exposes all  the connect middleware, so you can refer to them directly off the express module, as follows:     Or you can download third-party components from  npm   or somewhere else and install them  directly:     var express = require 'express' ; var middle_something = require 'middle_something' ; var app = express  ;  app.use middle_something   ;  * etc ... *      Configurations    Using only some middleware in certain configurations can be helpful. Some might modify your  output for speed or size so that it can be difficult or annoying to use  curl   to test your server.  To do this, you call the  configure   method on the express app, providing it with the name of  the configuration you want to target and a function that will be called when that configura- tion is needed. If you don’t provide a name, that function is called always, and you can provide  multiple configuration names separated by a comma before you provide the function, as  shown here:     app.configure  function      {   app.use express.bodyParser   ;  } ;  app.configure 'dev',  function      {   app.use express.logger 'dev'  ;  } ; app.configure 'production', 'staging',  function      {   app.use express.logger   ;  } ;      150  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  Middleware or routes that are set up outside  configure   function calls are considered applicable  for all configurations.     To run your app with a particular configuration, set the  NODE_ENV   environment variable to the  one you want. On most shells on your Mac or UNIX computer, you can run  node   as follows:     NODE_ENV=production node program.js     On Windows, you can, in the command prompt, just set the  NODE_ENV   and then run  node  VERIFY :     set NODE_ENV=production node program.js     Ordering of Middleware    The layering and order of these middleware components is important. As I mentioned, express  and connect work through them one at a time until it finds one that decides it can handle the  request. To see how this is relevant, consider the following simple app:     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.use express.logger 'dev'           move this to AFTER the next use   and see what happens!    .use express.responseTime       .use function req, res {        res.end 'hello world\n' ;    }     .listen 8080 ;     Call this app by using     curl -i localhost:8080 blargh     You should see the following:     HTTP 1.1 200 OK X-Powered-By: Express X-Response-Time: 0ms  Date: Wed, 05 Dec 2012 04:11:43 GMT Connection: keep-alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked  hello world     Now, watch what happens if you move the  responseTime   middleware component to the end,  as follows:      Additional Middleware Functionality  151  var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.use express.logger 'dev'           move this to AFTER the next use   and see what happens!    .use function req, res {        res.end 'hello world\n' ;    }     .use express.responseTime       .listen 8080 ;     Notice that the  X-Response-Time   header is gone!     HTTP 1.1 200 OK X-Powered-By: Express Date: Wed, 05 Dec 2012 04:14:05 GMT Connection: keep-alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked  hello world     The function that prints “Hello World!” took the request and handled it fully by not calling  next   and by using  res.end   to close down the response, so the  responseTime   middleware  never got a chance to inspect the request. As you’re adding middleware components, think  about how they’re going to fit together for the various routes your app will be using.     Static File Handling    You have written a little bit of Node code to serve static files in your application, but it turns  out that doing so is largely unnecessary. Express  through connect  provides a static middle- ware component that can do all this work for you!     To use it, you just pass the name of the base folder whose contents you want to serve statically  to the middleware creation function, as follows:     app.use express.static " secure static_site_files"  ;     You put this before the URL routers, and then when a request comes in, this static layer takes  the URL, appends it to its base folder name, and looks to see whether that file exists. For  example, if you request  content style.css, this middleware looks to see whether  secure  static_site_files content style.css exists and is readable. If it is, the middleware serves that file  and stops calling further layers. If not, it calls the  next   function.     If you want to serve static content from multiple locations, add multiple components:     app.use express.static " secure core_site_content"  ; app.use express.static " secure templates_and_html"  ;      152  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  Note, that while you technically can serve content from your application’s folder by using the  __dirname   predefined variable in Node  it gives you the path to the currently executing Node  script ,  this is a terrible idea and you should never do it .     The static middleware provides no security at all, so say you take the photo-sharing application  from before and just add     app.use express.static __dirname  ;     You could then—as expected—browse for  content style.css and  templates home.html without  any problems. The problem is that if the user asks for  server.js or  handlers albums.js, the  static middleware happily serves that as well because they both lie off the  __dirname   base  folder.     You might ask why security has not been added to the  static   middleware component, but this  is the wrong question—it’s an unnecessary complication. If you want to use this component,  put your static content outside your application source tree. Indeed, as I’ve hinted before, you  might even choose to have your application avoid serving static content altogether and opt to  put the static content on CDNs instead. So get used to separating those components out from  your source tree right from the start.     If you rewrite the server.js to use the static middleware, it looks something like the following. It  does, require, however, that you move the content , templates , and album  folders to another  location so that you can avoid the security problem I just mentioned. The updated app struc- ture looks as follows:     + root_folder    + static     + albums     + content     + templates   + app     + handlers     + node_modules      Then the server.js file can look like that shown in  Listing    7.3   . One nice thing about this new  version of the server is that you’ve managed to remove two routing functions—those for  content and templates.     Listing 7.3      Using the Static Middleware  server.js      var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  var fs = require 'fs' ,     album_hdlr = require '. handlers albums.js' ,    page_hdlr = require '. handlers pages.js' ,    helpers = require '. handlers helpers.js' ;   Additional Middleware Functionality  153  app.use express.static __dirname + " .. static"  ;  app.get  ' v1 albums.json' , album_hdlr.list_all ; app.get  ' v1 albums :album_name.json' , album_hdlr.album_by_name ; app.get  ' pages :page_name' , page_hdlr.generate ; app.get  ' pages :page_name :sub_page' , page_hdlr.generate ;  app.get  " " ,  function    req, res  {     res.redirect " pages home" ;    res.end  ;  app.get  '*' , four_oh_four ;  } ;  }  app.listen 8080 ;     function  four_oh_four  req, res  {     res.writeHead 404, { "Content-Type" : "application json" } ;    res.end JSON.stringify helpers.invalid_resource    + "\n" ;  If you’re paying attention, you might have noticed the new route added for      that reroutes you  to  pages home using the  ServerResponse.redirect   method, to save some typing in the web  browser!     POST Data, Cookies, and Sessions    Express and connect already provide you with some help with the query parameters by  parsing them and placing them in  req.query . Although you saw back in  Chapter    4   , “Writing  Applications,” that it’s possible to load and parse form POST data yourself using streams, the  good news is that you don’t have to do this—middleware can do all this work for you. And you  can even have it set up cookies and sessions for you. The middleware components to do this  are  bodyParser ,  cookieParser , and  session , respectively:     app.use express.bodyParser   ; app.use express.cookieParser   ;     For the first one, all body data is parsed and placed in  req.body . If the incoming data is in  urlencoded   or JSON format, the individual fields are placed in  req.body   as fields on an object.  cookieParser   does something similar, except it places the values in  req.cookies   instead.     To set a cookie on the  outgoing   response, use the  cookie   function on the response object, with  the name and value  and optional timeout values :      154  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  var express = require 'express' ;  var app = express       .use express.logger 'dev'      .use express.cookieParser       .use function req, res {        res.cookie "pet", "Zimbu the Monkey",                   { expires: new Date Date.now   + 86400000  } ;        res.end JSON.stringify req.query  + "\n" ;    }     .listen 8080 ;     To clear a cookie you’ve set, just use the  clearCookie   method on the response object with the  name of the cookie you’d like removed.     Setting up sessions is a bit more involved, requiring that you first provide a memory store and a  secret key to encrypt values with:     var MemStore = express.session.MemoryStore; app.use express.session { secret: "cat on keyboard",                            cookie: { maxAge: 1800000 },                           store: new MemStore  }  ;     In this example, you set a secret key, and then you use the  MemoryStore   class provided by the  connect module. This is very convenient and easy to use but resets itself every time you restart  Node. If you want something that will last past server restarts, you should look in  npm   for some  other options that use external storage such as  memcache   or  redis    see the next two chapters .  By default, session cookies never expire. If you want to expire them, provide the number of  milliseconds of validity. Here, the code indicates you will not accept session cookies older than  30 minutes.     When you have the sessions ready to go,  req.session   is populated with the session data. To  add new session data, you simply set a new value on this object. It is persisted and sent with  the response:     var express = require 'express' ; var MemStore = express.session.MemoryStore;  var app = express       .use express.logger 'dev'      .use express.cookieParser       .use express.session { secret: "cat on keyboard",                              see what happens for value of maybe 3000                           cookie: { maxAge: 1800000 },                           store: new MemStore  }      .use  function    req, res {        var x = req.session.last_access;     undefined when cookie not set        req.session.last_access = new Date  ;   Additional Middleware Functionality  155         res.end "You last asked for this page at: " + x ;    }     .listen 8080 ;     File Uploads    The express  bodyParser   middleware component automatically includes the connect  multipart component for you, which provides support for file uploads. If you upload a file to your app  using the  multipart form-data    enctype , you see the  req.files   contain any files sent with the  request:     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express       .use express.logger 'dev'      .use express.bodyParser       .use  function    req, res {        if  !req.files  !req.files.album_cover  {            res.end "Hunh. Did you send a file?" ;        } else {            console.log req.files ;            res.end "You have asked to set the album cover for "                    + req.body.albumid                    + " to '" + req.files.album_cover.name + "'\n" ;        }    }     .listen 8080 ;     To test this, you can still use  curl ! It can upload files along with the request by combining the  -F   option  for form data  and the  @   operator with a filename, which tells it to send that file:     curl -i -H "Expect:" --form 'album_cover=@oranges.jpg' \  --form albumid=italy2012 http:  localhost:8080     There is one trick, however, and that is that  curl   sometimes expects the server to send the  response  100 Continue   and then hang waiting. To get around this, you pass  -H "Expect:" to  curl , which lets you test file uploads normally.     Better Browser Support for PUT and DELETE    PUT    object creation  and  DELETE    object destruction  are critical parts of REST APIs that you  are using, and the client web pages send data to the server via these methods. For example, in  jQuery, to say you want to delete a comment, you use     $.ajax {  }        url: 'http:  server v1 comments 234932598235.json',    type: 'DELETE'   156  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  In most modern web browsers, this technique works just fine. However, in some older browsers   well, and any Internet Explorer version before 10 , it fails. The reason is that their implementa- tion of  XmlHttpRequest , the object via which AJAX requests are done, does not support  PUT   or  DELETE   as a method.     A common and elegant solution is to add a new header called  X-HTTP-Method-Override to your output, with the method you really want to use, and then just use  POST   to post the  request to the server. The jQuery code would then become     $.ajax {    beforeSend: function xhr  {        xhr.setRequestHeader 'X-HTTP-Method-Override', 'DELETE' ;    },    url: 'http:  server v1 comments 234932598235.json',    type: 'POST'  }     To support this solution on your server, you use the  methodOverride   middleware, as follows:     app.use express.methodOverride   ;     It looks for this header and converts  POST   requests to  DELETE   or  PUT   as necessary. Thus, the  app.delete   and  app.put   routes work exactly as expected.     Compressing Output    To save on bandwidth costs and speed, many web servers compress output using  gzip   or some  similar algorithm before sending it down to the client. This requires that the client first indi- cate that it is able to accept compressed output with the  Accept-Encoding   HTTP header. If  this is provided and the server knows how, it adds the  Content-Encoding   header on output  with the appropriate algorithm specified and then sends down the compressed data.     To use this feature in your app, you can use the compress middleware. It is truly a hassle- free component; it checks whether the client accepts compressed output via headers, sets the  response headers, and compresses the output, as shown here:     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.use express.logger 'dev'  ; app.use express.compress   ;  app.get ' ',  function  req, res {     res.send 'hello world this should be compressed\n' ;  } ;  app.listen 8080 ;      Additional Middleware Functionality  157  The only downside to this module is that it might interfere with some of your development  testing   curl   just prints the compressed binary data to the screen, which can be annoying , so  it is common for you to use this only in a production configuration, as follows:     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.use express.logger 'dev'  ; app.configure 'production', function    {     app.use express.compress   ;  app.get ' ', function req, res {     res.send 'hello world this should be compressed\n' ;  app.listen 8080 ;     HTTP Basic Authentication    Middleware can also help you with HTTP Basic Authentication, if you want to use that in your  application. Despite being frequently maligned as outdated and unsafe, Basic Authentication,  when combined with SSL and HTTPS, actually can be a reasonable and sufficiently robust secu- rity solution for your applications.     To use it, you set up the  basicAuth   middleware, providing it a function that takes a username  and password. It returns  true   if the provided authentication information is good, or  false   if  not, as shown here:     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.use express.basicAuth auth_user  ; app.get ' ',  function  req, res {   res.send 'secret message that only auth\'d users can see\n' ;  app.listen 8080 ;  function  auth_user  user, pass  {     if  user == 'marcwan'        && pass == 'this is how you get ants'  {        return true;    } else {        return false;    }  } ;  } ;  } ;  }      158  Chapter 7  Building Web Applications with Express  If you run this server and then try to browse to it, it asks you for a username and password  before letting you continue.     Error Handling    Although you can handle errors individually for each request, sometimes you might like to  have a global error handler for common situations. To do this, you provide a function that  takes four parameters to the  app.use   method:     app.use function  err, req, res, next  {     res.status 500 ;    res.end JSON.stringify err  + "\n" ;  } ;     This method is placed after all the other middleware setup and routing functions so that it’s the  last function that express calls in the app. You can examine the exact error in this function and  decide what to return to the user. As an example, here is a version that converts any given  err object or thrown  Error   object to appropriate JSON and returns it to the client as a server error:     var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.get ' ',  function  req, res {     throw new Error "Something bad happened" ;    res.send 'Probably will never get to this message.\n' ;  } ;  } ;  } ;     } ;     app.use  function    err, req, res, next  {     res.status 500 ;    res.end err + "\n" ;  app.listen 8080 ;     Finally, Node.js allows you to specify a global application-wide error handler via the  process object:     process.on 'uncaughtException', function  err  {     console.log 'Caught exception: ' + err ;  It is, however, a  terrible   idea to use this for anything other than logging or diagnostic purposes.  If this function is called, you should assume that Node is in a very unhappy or unstable state  and should be restarted. So, for those situations when you use this function, it is merely to log  the error and then terminate the node process:     process.on 'uncaughtException', function  err  {     console.log 'Caught exception: ' + err ;    process.exit -1 ;   Summary  159  You should use  try catches   around situations in which errors are possible, and for those  extremely catastrophic or completely unexpected scenarios, let the process die and restart it— automatically if possible.     Summary    This is another big chapter with tons of fun new stuff. I introduced the express application  framework, talked about middleware, described how to use cookies and sessions, and helped  you convert some of the code in your photo-sharing application into modules. You also  managed to get rid of a lot of code by using static file-serving middleware and can now add  compression, authentication, and better error handling to your applications.     The photo-sharing application is shaping up quite nicely, but it still feels a bit rudimentary;  you have only pictures in the albums and no great place to store any additional information  you might like to add to albums or photos. With this issue in mind, in the following chapters  you start looking at databases—first NoSQL  CouchDB  and then MySQL—and see how you can  use them in Node. You also look at some caching solutions and continue to grow out the little  app into something more useful.      This page intentionally left blank    8  Databases I: NoSQL   MongoDB      Now that you have a solid foundation for your web application and are fully set up with the   express web application framework and Mustache templating, you are ready to spend a couple  of chapters adding a back end to it. In these next two chapters, you look at two common ways  this is done. You start in this chapter by looking at a popular NoSQL database called MongoDB,  which provides a quick and easy way to serialize JSON data directly to a database. This chapter  covers the basics of using it, and then you update your album handler to let   you store album  and photo data to the database.     I chose to work with MongoDB instead of other popular NoSQL databases—in particular,  CouchDB—because it’s particularly easy to use and has some wonderful querying functional- ity that others don’t provide so readily. Because the goal of this book is to teach you about  working with Node.js, I wanted to choose the database server that was easiest to work with and  would let you focus on your primary mission.     If you’re more comfortable working with MySQL or other relational databases, this chapter is  still very much worth reading because you see how you move the album and photo handlers  from file-based to database-backed modules. In the next chapter, where I discuss relational  database systems, I provide a version of the code for MySQL as well.     Setting Up MongoDB    To use MongoDB in your Node.js applications, you need to do two things: install the database  server itself and make it work with Node.     Installing MongoDB    To get started with MongoDB, you can just download the binaries from  http:  mongodb.org .  Distributions for most platforms are in  zip   file format, and you extract them to some location  from which you’d like to run MongoDB.      162  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   In the bin  subfolder, you should find a file called mongod, which is the base database server  daemon . To run the server in a development environment, you typically just use     . mongod --dbpath  path to db dir                     unix mongod --dbpath \path\to\db\dir                       windows     You can create a folder like ~ src mongodbs or something similar to hold your databases. To  quickly delete them and restart your database server, just press Ctrl+C to kill the current server  and then run the following:     rm  path to db dir * && . mongod --dbpath  path to db dir      unix del \path\to\db\dir\*                                          windows 1 mongod --dbpath \path\to\db\dir                                windows 2     To test your installation, open another terminal window or command prompt, and run the  mongo program, which runs a simple interpreter that looks a lot like the Node REPL:     Kimidori:bin marcw$  . mongo MongoDB shell version: 2.2.2 connecting to: test >  show dbs  local  empty  >     For deployment to a live production environment, you should read the MongoDB documenta- tion a bit further and learn about best practices and configuration options, including setting up  replication and backups, for example.     Using MongoDB in Node.js    After verifying the MongoDB installation, you need to hook it up to Node.js. The most popular  driver being used currently is the official native-mongodb for Node written by 10gen, the  company that produces MongoDB. There is a relational-object mapping  ROM  layer called  mongoose for MongoDB and Node.js that is quite popular, but you can stick with the simple  driver for this book because it provides everything you want  your data needs are not terribly  complicated  and lets you structure your code to be more database agnostic  as we’ll see in the  next chapter .     To install the mongodb module, add the following to your package.json file:     {   "name": "MongodB-Demo",  "description": "Demonstrates Using MongoDB in Node.js",  "version": "0.0.1",  "private": true,  "dependencies": {    "async": "0.1.x",      "mongodb": "1.2.x"    } }      Structuring Your Data for MongoDB  163  You can then run  npm update   to get the latest version of all the drivers. If you look in the  node_modules  folder, you should see the mongodb  subfolder there.     Structuring Your Data for MongoDB    MongoDB is quite suitable for use in your applications because it uses JSON for storage itself.  Whenever you create or add things to your database, you pass around JavaScript objects— which is extremely convenient for you in Node!     If you’ve used relational databases before, you’re likely familiar with the terminology of data- bases, tables, and rows. In MongoDB, these elements are called  databases ,  collections , and   documents , respectively. Databases can be partitioned into collections of like objects, all of  which are represented by JSON documents.     All objects in MongoDB have a unique identifier, represented by  _id . It can basically be any  type as long as it’s a unique value. If you do not provide one, MongoDB creates one for you:  It is an instance of the class  ObjectID . When printed, it returns a 24-character hexadecimal  string, such as  50da80c04d403ebda7000012 .     It’s All JavaScript    For the photo album application, you need to create two document types: one for albums and  one for photos within albums. You do not need to use MongoDB’s autogenerated  _id   values  because you always have uniquely identifying information for your documents: For albums,  the  album_name   is always unique, and for photos, the combination of  album_name   and photo  filename   is unique.     Thus, you store your albums as follows:     { _id: "italy2012",  name:"italy2012",  title:"Spring Festival in Italy",  date:"2012 02 15",  description:"I went to Italy for Spring Festival." }     And your photo documents look similar to the following:     { _id: "italy2012_picture_01.jpg",   filename: "picture_01.jpg",  albumid: "italy2012",  description: "ZOMGZ it's Rome!",  date: "2012 02 15 16:20:40" }     Attempting to insert values into a collection with duplicate  _id   values causes MongoDB to  signal an error. You use this capability to ensure that albums are unique and that image files  within an album are also unique.      164  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   Data Types    For the most part, working with MongoDB in JavaScript is entirely natural feeling and straight- forward. There are, however, a couple of scenarios in which you might run into some trouble,  so it’s worth covering them now.     As you saw back in  Chapter    2   , “A Closer Look at JavaScript,” JavaScript represents all numbers  as 64-bit double-precision floating-point numbers. This gives you 53 bits of integer precision.  But there is frequently a legitimate need for fully 64-bit integer values. When the reduced preci- sion and approximations are unacceptable, you can use the  Long   class that the mongodb driver  for Node has provided. It takes a string value in its constructor and lets you perform opera- tions on 64-bit integer values. It has a number of methods such as  toString ,  compare , and  add   subtract   multiply   to mimic all common operations you’d expect for integer values.     JavaScript also has a  Binary   class that, as you might expect, lets you store binary data into  your documents. You can pass the constructor either a string or a  Buffer   object instance, and  the data is stored as binary data. When you reload the document later, the value is returned to  you again with some extra metadata describing how Mongo is storing it in the collection.     Finally, I want to mention the  Timestamp   class, which saves times to the database document,  but does so when you actually write the record! So you can just set a value as follows:     { _id : "unique _identifier1234",   when: new TimeStamp  ,  what: "Good News Everyone!" };     For a complete list of the data type helpers that the mongodb module provides, check out the  documentation at github.com mongodb node-mongodb-native and also look at the source  code in node_modules mongodb node_modules bson lib bson .     Understanding the Basic Operations    Now it’s time to make some things happen with MongoDB and Node.js. At the top of every file  that uses the mongodb module, include the following:     var Db = require 'mongodb' .Db,     Connection = require 'mongodb' .Connection,    Server = require 'mongodb' .Server;     For those situations in which you use extra types, such as  Long   or  Binary , you can refer to  them through the mongodb module as follows:     var mongodb = require 'mongodb' ;  var b = new mongodb.Binary binary_data ; var l = new mongodb.Long number_string ;      Understanding the Basic Operations  165  Connecting and Creating a Database    To connect to a MongoDB server, you need to use the  Server   and  Db   classes. You can option- ally also use the  Connection   class to get the default port number that the server listens on. The  code to create the shared  db   object is as follows:     var Db = require 'mongodb' .Db,     Connection = require 'mongodb' .Connection,    Server = require 'mongodb' .Server;  var host = process.env['MONGO_NODE_DRIVER_HOST'] != null     ? process.env['MONGO_NODE_DRIVER_HOST'] : 'localhost';  var port = process.env['MONGO_NODE_DRIVER_PORT'] != null     ? process.env['MONGO_NODE_DRIVER_PORT'] : Connection.DEFAULT_PORT;  var db = new Db 'PhotoAlbums',                 new Server host, port,                           { auto_reconnect: true,                             poolSize: 20} ,                { w: 1 } ;     MongoDB and the mongodb module you use are quite flexible with the way they handle writes  and data integrity. The  { w: 1 }   flag you pass to the database constructor tells them to wait  until at least one confirmed write has succeeded before calling any callbacks you provide to  database operations. You can specify higher numbers for environments with replication or 0 for  those cases in which you don’t care to know when the writes are finished.     You don’t need to create a new  Db   object for each incoming request to your application server,  nor do you need to worry about multiple people trying to work with the database server at the  same time: The mongodb module handles connection pooling and manages multiple requests  at the same time for you. You can choose how many connections to maintain to the MongoDB  server by adjusting the value of the  poolSize   parameter to the  Server   object constructor, as  shown in the preceding code.     The name of the database you want to create, or use if it already exists, is passed to the  constructor of the  Db   object. It is created if it does not exist.     Creating Collections    As mentioned previously, collections are the MongoDB equivalent of tables from  relational database systems, and you create them with a call to either the  collection   or  createCollection   method on the  Db   object. By specifying the  { safe: true }   option as a  second parameter, you can control exactly how they work with regards to existing or nonexist- ing collections  see  Table    8.1    .      166  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   { safe: true }        Effect     Table 8.1      Creating   Function     collection     collection      Yes      No     createCollection      Yes     createCollection      No      Opens a collection if it exists; returns an error if not     Opens a collection if it exists; creates the collection on  first insertion if not      Creates a collection if it does not exist; returns an error  if it does exist     Creates a collection if it doesn’t exist; returns an  existing collection if it does     To use the  { safe: true }   option, you write your code as follows:     db.collection "albums", { safe: true }, function  err, albums  {        ... do stuff  } ;     The code you will use most commonly to create or open a collection, however, is simply     db.collection "albums", function  err, albums  {     if  err  {        console.error err ;        return;    }        albums can now be used to do stuff ...  } ;     Inserting Documents into Collections    To insert data into a collection, you use the  insert   method as follows:     var album = { _id: "italy2012",               name: "italy2012",              title: "Spring Festival in Italy",              date: "2012 02 15",              description: "I went to Italy for Spring Festival." };  albums.insert album, { safe: true },  function    err, inserted_doc  {     if  err && err.name == "MongoError" && err.code == 11000  {        console.log "This album exists already, sorry." ;        return;    } else if  err  {        console.log "Something bad happened." ;   Understanding the Basic Operations  167         return;    }       continue as normal  } ;     You see that you are specifying your own  _id   field for the document. If you did not, MongoDB  would provide one for you. If a document with that  _id   exists already, the callback is called  with an error. You also can see that you pass the  { safe: true }   option again because you  want to be sure that the write succeeds. If you were writing a store for an analytics application  and it would be acceptable to lose the occasional value here and there, you could omit this  option.     You can insert multiple documents at the same time by passing an array to the  insert function:     var docs = [{ _id: "italy2012",               name: "italy2012",              title: "Spring Festival in Italy",              date: "2012 02 15",              description: "I went to Italy for Spring Festival." },            { _id: "australia2010",              name: "australia2010",              title: "Vacation Down Under",              date: "2010 10 20",              description: "Visiting some friends in Oz!" },            { _id: "japan2010",              name: "japan2010",              title: "Programming in Tokyo",              date: "2010 06 10",              description: "I worked in Tokyo for a while."            }];  albums.insert docs, { safe: true }, callback ;     Updating Document Values    To update a document, you can call the  update   method on a collection. The first parameter  identifies a document or set of documents, and the second is an  object description   of how to  modify the matching document s . The object description comes in the form of a command  and a field or fields to accompany it:     photos.update { filename: "photo_03.jpg", albumid: "japan2010" },              {  $set : { description: "NO SHINJUKU! BAD DOG!" } },              { safe: true },              callback ;     In this description, you use the command  $set , which tells MongoDB to update the value of  the provided field with the provided new value; here, you tell it to update the  description   field    168  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   with a new value. There are a lot of different commands you can use, some of the more inter- esting of which are listed in  Table    8.2   .     Table 8.2      Update Commands     Command        Effect  $set     $inc     $rename     $push     $pushAll     $pop     $pull     Sets the value of the given field to the given value.     Increments the value of the specified field.      Renames the specified field to the given new name.     If the field is an array, this pushes a new value to the end of it.      If the field is an array, this pushes the given new multiple values to the end  of it.     Removes the last element of the array field.     Removes the given value s  from an array field.     Deleting Documents from Collections    To delete data from a collection, you use the  remove   method on the collection object. You can  specify any set of fields to identify a document or set of documents:     photos.remove { filename: "photo_04.jpg", albumid: "japan2010" },               { safe: true },              callback ;     You can skip the  safe: true   option and the callback if you don’t care to confirm that the  delete completed:     photos.remove { filename: "photo_04.jpg", albumid: "japan2010" } ;     You can also remove all documents in a collection by simply calling  remove   with no  arguments:     photos.remove  ;        DANGER ZONE!!     Querying Collections    By far, the biggest reason that MongoDB is the most popular of the NoSQL database engines  is that its ability to find documents in collections most closely matches the behavior of tradi- tional SQL database queries. All your work here is done with the  find   function on collections.     Find Basics    Before starting, note that the  find   method itself does not actually do any work; it sets up a  results cursor  which is an object that can iterate over the set of rows returned from executing    Understanding the Basic Operations  169  a query . The query is not executed and the contents of the cursor are not actually generated  until you call one of the functions on it:  nextObject ,  each ,  toArray , or  streamRecords .     The first three operate as you’d expect:  nextObject   can just be called to get one document,  each   calls a function with each resulting document, and  toArray   fetches all the documents  and passes them as a parameter to a callback:     var cursor = albums.find  ;  cursor.nextObject function err, first_match  {} ; cursor.each function err, document  {} ; cursor.toArray function err, all_documents  {} ;     If you call the  find   method with no arguments, it matches all documents in the collection.     You can use the  streamRecords   method on the cursor to create a  Stream   object, which you  can then use as you use other streams:     var stream = collection.find .streamRecords  ; stream.on "data", function document  {} ;        why  data   and not  readable ? See text! stream.on "end", function   {} ;     This is the preferred way to fetch large numbers of records because it has a lower memory foot- print than methods such as  toArray , which return all the documents in a single chunk. At  the time of the writing of this book, the mongodb module had not been updated to the new  "readable"   event model that streams in Node.js use now; it is entirely possible that this has  changed by the time you start using it. So, double-check, just to be sure.  The best place would  be at the official site for the driver,  http:  mongodb.github.com node-mongodb-native  .      To find specific documents in your collection, you can specify the fields to match as the first  parameter to the  find   function:     photos.find { albumid: "italy2012" } .toArray function  err, results  ;     You can use operators in  find   queries quite similar to those you saw previously for the  update function. For example, if you had documents for people, you could find all people older than  age 20 with     users.find { age: { $gt: 20 } } .toArray callback ;     You can combine these operators using logical operations such as  $and   and  $or   to give more  powerful queries. For example, to return all users between the ages of 20 and 40  inclusive , you  could use     users.find { $and: [ { age: { $gte: 20 } }, { age: { $lte: 40 } } ] } ;     Some more operators are shown in  Table    8.3   . For a full listing of them, consult the MongoDB  query documentation.      170  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   Table 8.3      Find Operators     Operator        Meaning     Not equal     Less than     Less than or equal     Greater than     Greater than or equal     $ne     $lt     $lte     $gt     $gte     $in     $nin     $all     Matches if the field value is one of the values in the given array of values     Matches if the field value is  not   one of the values in the given array of values     Matches if the given field is an array and contains all the values in the given  array of values     Searching for MongoDB Generated IDs    I mentioned previously that if you do not provide an  _id   field in documents you insert,  MongoDB provides one for you. These autogenerated  _id   fields are of type  ObjectID   and  are represented as 24-character hexadecimal strings.    The problem is that if you use these fields, you cannot search for them simply by specifying the  string value of the ID. You need to wrap them back in an  ObjectID   class constructor, as fol- lows:     var ObjectID = require 'mongodb' .ObjectID; var idString = '50da9d8d138cbc5da9000012'; collection.find {_id: new ObjectID idString }, callback ;     If you try to execute the following, you don’t get any matches:     collection.find { _id: idString }, callback ;     You won’t encounter this problem in the apps you’re developing in this book because you are  going to always generate your own  _id   fields.     Further Refining Your Finds    To implement paging and sorting on your pages, you need to be able to manipulate or other- wise modify the results of the  find   operations. The mongodb module lets you do this by  chaining additional function calls with these effects to the  find   operation, before you call one  of the functions to generate a cursor.     The methods you’ll use the most are  skip ,  limit , and  sort . The first indicates how many  documents in the result set should be ignored before you start returning any, the second    Updating Your Photo Albums App  171  controls how many should be returned after you’ve done any skipping, and the last controls  ordering and sorting—you are welcome to sort on more than one field.     So, to fetch all the photos in an album sorted ascending by date, you would write     To return the third page of these photos, assuming pages are 20 photos each, you would use     photos.find { albumid: "italy2012" }      .sort { date: 1}          1 is asc, -1 is desc    .toArray function  err, results  ;     photos.find { albumid: "italy2012" }      .sort { date: 1}          1 is asc, -1 is desc    .skip 40     .limit 20     .toArray function  err, results  { } ;     Again, anything called before the  toArray   function at the end is just setting up the results  cursor, and the query is not executed until that last function call.     You can pass multiple fields to the  sort   function for sorting on multiple values:     collection.find       .sort { field1: -1, field2: 1 }     .toArray callback ;     Updating Your Photo Albums App    With this understanding of the basics of using MongoDB in Node.js, you can update your  photo-sharing application to use a database instead of just the simple file system functions to  store album and photo information. You still keep the actual image files on your hard disk,  but in a real production environment, you would put them on some sort of storage server or  content delivery network  CDN .     Writing the Low-Level Operations    You begin by adding a new folder named data  to your application. You can put low-level oper- ations to the back end in this folder. You also create a file called backend_helpers.js that will  contain some functions to help you work with and generate errors, validate parameters, and do  some other common back-end operations. These tasks are all pretty simple, and you can view  the source code on GitHub.     Creating a Configuration File    In the application root folder, create a new file called local.config.js, which contains the follow- ing JavaScript:      172  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   exports.config = {     db_config: {        host: "localhost",           use default "port"        poolSize: 20    },     static_content: ".. static "  };     Including this file means that all of the configuration options are handily located in one place,  and you can change it trivially without having to rummage through code looking for things.     Getting Your Databases and Collections    Next, create a file called db.js in data . In this file, you create the database connection and  collections you use for your photo application. In this file, you also create the connection to  the PhotoAlbums database using the information in the local.config.js file:     var Db = require 'mongodb' .Db,     Connection = require 'mongodb' .Connection,    Server = require 'mongodb' .Server,    async = require 'async' ,    local = require ".. local.config.js" ;  var host = local.config.db_config.host     ? local.config.db_config.host    : 'localhost';  var port = local.config.db_config.port     ? local.config.db_config.port    : Connection.DEFAULT_PORT;  var ps = local.config.db_config.poolSize     ? local.config.db_config.poolSize : 5;  var db = new Db 'PhotoAlbums',                 new Server host, port,                           { auto_reconnect: true,                             poolSize: ps} ,                { w: 1 } ;     exports. init   = function  callback  {     async.waterfall [            1.   open database connection         function    cb  {            db.open cb ;        },  Now, to get the actual album and photo collections, you need to open the connection and  make sure those collections exist. You do this by adding the following function to db.js:      Updating Your Photo Albums App  173             2.   create collections for our albums and photos. if              they already exist, then we're good.         function    opened_db, cb  {            db.collection "albums", cb ;        },         function    albums_coll, cb  {            exports.albums = albums_coll;            db.collection "photos", cb ;        },         function    photos_coll, cb  {            exports.photos = photos_coll;            cb null ;        }       we'll just pass results back to caller, so can skip results fn    ], callback ;  };  exports. albums   = null; exports. photos   = null;     var db = require '. db.js' ; var albums =  db.albums ;     You can see that  albums   and  photos   are now exported objects in db.js, so people can fetch  them whenever they need them by writing     Finally, you need to make sure your  db.init   function is called before the application starts, so  replace the call in server.js     app.listen 8080 ;     with     db.init  function    err, results  {     if  err  {        console.error "** FATAL ERROR ON STARTUP: " ;        console.error err ;        process.exit -1 ;    }    app.listen 8080 ;  } ;     Creating an Album    The low-level code to create a new album becomes     exports. create_album   = function  data, callback  {     var final_album;    var write_succeeded = false;   174  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB      async.waterfall [         function    cb  {            try {                backhelp.verify data,                                [ "name", "title", "date", "description" ] ;                if  !backhelp.valid_filename data.name                      throw invalid_album_name  ;            } catch  e  {                cb e ;            }            cb null, data ;        },             create the album in mongo.          function    album_data, cb  {            var write = JSON.parse JSON.stringify album_data  ;            write._id = album_data.name;            db.albums.insert write, { w: 1, safe: true }, cb ;        },             make sure the folder exists.          function    new_album, cb  {            write_succeeded = true;            final_album = new_album[0];            fs.mkdir local.config.static_content                     + "albums " + data.name, cb ;        }    ],     function    err, results  {        if  err  {            if  write_succeeded                 db.albums.remove { _id: data.name }, function    {} ;            if    err instanceof Error && err.code == 11000                 callback backhelp.album_already_exists   ;            else if  err instanceof Error && err.errno != undefined                 callback backhelp.file_error err  ;            else                callback err ;        } else {            callback err, err ? null : final_album ;        }    } ;  };     Although the async module makes the code a bit “longer” and spread out, I hope you can  already see how much it cleans things up. All the asynchronous operations are expressed as a  sequence of things that need to be done; async takes care of all the messy details for you!      Updating Your Photo Albums App  175  You do one trick here in the code to clone an object:     var write = JSON.parse JSON.stringify album_data  ;     It turns out that quickly serializing and deserializing an object is one of the quickest ways to  clone it in JavaScript. The reason we clone the object in the above previous code is so that  we do not modify an object that “isn’t ours,” per se. It can be considered rude  or downright  buggy  to modify objects passed in to our function, so we have just quickly cloned it before  adding the  _id   field. Note that backhelp is simply the backend  in the data  folder  version of  the helper functions we’ve seen before in helpers.js.     Finding Albums    Loading an album given its name is quite an easy operation:     exports. album_by_name   = function  name, callback  {     db.albums.find { _id: name } .toArray  function    err, results  {        if  err  {            callback err ;            return;        }         if  results.length == 0  {            callback null, null ;        } else if  results.length == 1  {            callback null, results[0] ;        } else {            console.error "More than one album named: " + name ;            console.error results ;            callback backutils.db_error   ;        }    } ;  You spend more time on error handling and validation than you do actually finding the  album.     exports. all_albums   = function  sort_field, sort_desc, skip, count, callback  {  };     };     Listing All Albums    Similarly, listing all the albums is quite easy:        var sort = {};    sort[sort_field] = sort_desc ? -1 : 1;    db.albums.find          .sort sort         .limit count         .skip skip         .toArray callback ;   176  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   Getting the Photos in an Album    Finding all photos in a given album is also no sweat:     exports. photos_for_album   = function  album_name, pn, ps, callback  {     var sort = { date: -1 };    db.photos.find { albumid: album_name }         .skip pn         .limit ps         .sort "date"         .toArray callback ;  };     Adding a Photo to an Album    Indeed, the only other semicomplicated operation you need to perform is adding a photo to  an album, and that is a bit more work because you have to add the step to copy the temporary  uploaded file to its final resting place in the static albums  folder:     exports. add_photo   = function  photo_data, path_to_photo, callback  {     var final_photo;    var base_fn = path.basename path_to_photo .toLowerCase  ;    async.waterfall [         function    cb  {            try {                backhelp.verify photo_data,                                [ "albumid", "description", "date" ] ;                photo_data.filename = base_fn;                if  !backhelp.valid_filename photo_data.albumid                      throw invalid_album_name  ;            } catch  e  {                cb e ;            }            cb null, photo_data ;        },             add the photo to the collection          function    pd, cb  {            pd._id = pd.albumid + "_" + pd.filename;            db.photos.insert pd, { w: 1, safe: true }, cb ;        },             now copy the temp file to static content          function    new_photo, cb  {            final_photo = new_photo[0];            var save_path = local.config.static_content + "albums "                + photo_data.albumid + " " + base_fn;            backhelp.file_copy path_to_photo, save_path, true, cb ;   Updating Your Photo Albums App  177         }    ],     function    err, results    {        if  err && err instanceof Error && err.errno != undefined             callback backhelp.file_error err  ;        else            callback err, err ? null : final_photo ;    } ;  };     Modifying the API for the JSON Server    Next, you add the following two new API functions to the JSON server to facilitate creating  albums and adding photos to them:     app.put   ' v1 albums.json'  , album_hdlr.create_album ; app.put   ' v1 albums :album_name photos.json'  , album_hdlr.add_photo_to_album ;     The nice thing about express is that it makes this process that simple. When you add these two  lines, the API is expanded with new functionality, and now you just need to update the album  handler to support these new features.     Because the API now supports putting data, including files and POST bodies, you need to add  some more middleware to support this capability. So, add the following to the top of the server. js file:     app.use express.logger 'dev'  ; app.use express.bodyParser { keepExtensions: true }  ;     Here, you add some logging output, and the  bodyParser   populates the  req.body   and  req. files   when requests come in. Note that you instruct the  bodyParser   middleware to leave the  file extensions on incoming files. By default, it removes them.     Updating Your Handlers    Now that you have the database primitives for your album and photo operations, you need to  modify the album handler to use them instead of file system operations.     Some Helpful Classes    Begin by creating a couple of helpful little classes. The one for photos is as follows:     function  Photo    photo_data  {    this.filename = photo_data.filename;    this.date = photo_data.date;    this.albumid = photo_data.albumid;    this.description = photo_data.description;    this._id = photo_data._id;  }   The only real interesting function here is the  response_obj   function. You use it because the  Photo   class theoretically holds everything you could want to know about a photo, but when  you pass it back in JSON to the caller of an API, there might be some data you don’t want to  include in that response object. Consider a  User   object; you would certainly want to scrub out  passwords and other sensitive data.     A basic version of an  Album   object would also look as follows:     178  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   Photo.prototype. _id   = null; Photo.prototype. filename   = null; Photo.prototype. date   = null; Photo.prototype. albumid   = null; Photo.prototype. description   = null; Photo.prototype .response_obj   = function   {     return {        filename: this.filename,        date: this.date,        albumid: this.albumid,        description: this.description    };  };     function  Album    album_data  {     this.name = album_data.name;    this.date = album_data.date;    this.title = album_data.title;    this.description = album_data.description;    this._id = album_data._id;  }  };     Album.prototype. _id   = null; Album.prototype. name   = null; Album.prototype. date   = null; Album.prototype. title   = null; Album.prototype. description   = null;  Album.prototype. response_obj   = function    {     return { name: this.name,             date: this.date,             title: this.title,             description: this.description };  Now, look at how the handler class is reorganized to use the low-level album operations you  wrote in the previous section.      Updating Your Photo Albums App  179  Creating an Album    Again, you almost write more code checking for errors than you do performing the operation.  This is the nature of good coding. Too many books and tutorials skip out on these things, and  it’s one of the reasons there’s so much bad code in the world today!     var album_data = require '.. data album.js' ;    ... etc ... exports. create_album   = function  req, res  {     async.waterfall [         function    cb  {            if  !req.body  !req.body.name  !helpers.valid_filename req.body.name     {  };                    cb helpers.no_such_album   ;                return;            }            cb null ;        },         function    cb  {            album_data.create_album req.body, cb ;        }    ],     function    err, results  {        if  err  {            helpers.send_failure res, err ;        } else {            var a = new Album results ;            helpers.send_success res, {album: a.response_obj   } ;        }    } ;  Loading an Album by Name    Once again, error checking and handling make up 90 percent of your work. I highlighted the  call here to the back end to actually fetch the album:     exports. album_by_name   = function  req, res  {     async.waterfall [         function    cb  {            if  !req.params  !req.params.album_name                 cb helpers.no_such_album   ;            else                 album_data.album_by_name req.params.album_name, cb ;         }    ],     function    err, results  {        if  err  {   180  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB              helpers.send_failure res, err ;        } else if  !results  {            helpers.send_failure res, helpers.no_such_album   ;        } else {            var a = new Album album_data ;            helpers.send_success res, { album: a.response_obj   } ;        }    } ;  };     };     Listing All Albums    Here, you fetch only 25 albums at a time so as not to have overly complicated pages. You could  make these configurable via query parameters if you wanted:     exports. list_all   = function  req, res  {      album_data.all_albums "date", true, 0, 25, function  err, results  {         if  err  {            helpers.send_failure res, err ;        } else {            var out = [];            if  results  {                for  var i = 0; i < results.length; i++  {                    out.push new Album results[i] .response_obj   ;                }            }            helpers.send_success res, { albums: out } ;        }    } ;  This model of separating the handlers and database code seems as though it makes a bit more  work  and it does a little bit , but it has the huge advantage of giving you a very flexible back  end. In the next chapter, you see that you can switch the data store for albums and photos to  another database system without touching the album handler at all! You only need to modify  the classes in the data  folder.     Getting All Photos for an Album    The code to view photos in an album is shown in  Listing    8.1   . It involves two new methods,  exports.photos_for_album   and a new function to the  Album   object,  photos . Most of the  complexity of these functions comes from handling paging and slicing up the output array of  photos.      Updating Your Photo Albums App  181  Listing 8.1      Getting All the Photos in an Album     Album.prototype. photos   = function  pn, ps, callback  {     if  this.album_photos != undefined  {        callback null, this.album_photos ;        return;    }    album_data.photos_for_album         this.name,        pn, ps,         function    err, results  {            if  err  {                callback err ;                return;            }            var out = [];            for  var i = 0; i < results.length; i++  {                out.push new Photo results[i]  ;            }            this.album_photos = out;            callback null, this.album_photos ;        }     ;  };  exports. photos_for_album   = function req, res  {     var page_num = req.query.page ? req.query.page : 0;    var page_size = req.query.page_size ? req.query.page_size : 1000;     page_num = parseInt page_num ;    page_size = parseInt page_size ;    if  isNaN page_num   page_num = 0;    if  isNaN page_size   page_size = 1000;     var album;    async.waterfall [         function    cb  {               first get the album.            if  !req.params    !req.params.album_name                 cb helpers.no_such_album   ;            else                album_data.album_by_name req.params.album_name, cb ;        },          function    album_data, cb  {            if  !album_data  {                cb helpers.no_such_album   ;   182  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB                  return;            }            album = new Album album_data ;            album.photos page_num, page_size, cb ;        },         function    photos, cb  {            var out = [];            for  var i = 0; i < photos.length; i++  {                out.push photos[i].response_obj   ;            }            cb null, out ;        }    ],     function    err, results  {        if  err  {            helpers.send_failure res, err ;            return;        }        if  !results  results = [];        var out = { photos: results,                    album_data: album.response_obj   };        helpers.send_success res, out ;    } ;  };     Adding a Photo    Finally, you can write the API to add photos; it is shown in  Listing    8.2   . This API also involves  adding a new method to the  Album   object.     Listing 8.2      Adding Photos Using the API     Album.prototype. add_photo   = function  data, path, callback  {     album_data.add_photo data, path,  function    err, photo_data  {        if  err             callback err ;        else {            var p = new Photo photo_data ;            if  this.all_photos                 this.all_photos.push p ;            else                this.app_photos = [ p ];            callback null, p ;        }    } ;  };   Updating Your Photo Albums App  183  exports. add_photo_to_album   = function  req, res  {     var album;    async.waterfall [         function    cb  {            if  !req.body                 cb helpers.missing_data "POST data"  ;            else if  !req.files  !req.files.photo_file                 cb helpers.missing_data "a file"  ;            else if  !helpers.is_image req.files.photo_file.name                  cb helpers.not_image   ;            else                album_data.album_by_name req.params.album_name, cb ;        },          function    album_data, cb  {            if  !album_data  {                cb helpers.no_such_album   ;                return;            }            album = new Album album_data ;            req.body.filename = req.files.photo_file.name;            album.add_photo req.body, req.files.photo_file.path, cb ;        }    ],     function    err, p  {        if  err  {            helpers.send_failure res, err ;            return;        }        var out = { photo: p.response_obj  , album_data:   album.response_obj   };        helpers.send_success res, out ;    } ;  };     Adding Some New Pages to the Application    The JSON server is now completely modified to use MongoDB for all its album and photo  storage work. What you don’t have yet, however, are some pages to let you create new albums  or add new photos to albums via the web interface. Let’s fix that now.     Defining the URLs for the Pages    Here, you place the two new pages you want to create in  pages admin add_album and  pages  admin add_photo. Fortunately, you don’t need to modify the URL handlers in the express app  for this at all.      184  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   Creating an Album    Don’t forget that for each page in the Mustache-templated site, you need two files:              A JavaScript bootstrapper        A template HTML file     The code to bootstrap the add album page is trivial; it doesn’t even need to load any JSON from  the server, only the template. It is shown in  Listing    8.3   .     Listing 8.3      admin_add_album.js     $  function   {     var tmpl,      Main template HTML    tdata = {};     JSON data object that feeds the template        Initialize page    var initPage =  function    {            Load the HTML template        $.get " templates admin_add_album.html",  function    d {            tmpl = d;        } ;            When AJAX calls are complete parse the template           replacing mustache tags with vars        $ document .ajaxStop  function      {            var renderedPage = Mustache.to_html  tmpl, tdata  ;            $ "body" .html  renderedPage  ;        }     }  ;  } ;     The code for the HTML page to add the album is a bit more complicated because you need to  do some JavaScript to do the form submission via Ajax. This code is shown in  Listing    8.4   . The  trickery you see with the  dateString   variable is to ensure that dates are always in the format  yyyy mm dd , and not sometimes  yyyy m d .     Listing 8.4      admin_add_album.html     <form name="create_album" id="create_album"       enctype="multipart form-data"      method="PUT"      action=" v1 albums.json">    Create New Album:       Updating Your Photo Albums App  185    Album Name:         Title::         Description:                       $ "inputsubmit_button" .click  function    e  {      var m = new Date  ;      var dateString =          m.getUTCFullYear   +" "+           "0" +  m.getUTCMonth  +1  .slice -2  +" "+           "0" + m.getUTCDate   .slice -2  + " " +           "0" + m.getUTCHours   .slice -2  + ":" +           "0" + m.getUTCMinutes   .slice -2  + ":" +           "0" + m.getUTCSeconds   .slice -2 ;       $ "inputdate" .val dateString ;       var json = "{ \"name\": \"" + $ "inputname" .val            + "\", \"date\": \"" + $ "inputdate" .val            + "\", \"title\": \"" + $ "inputtitle" .val            + "\",   \"description\": \"" + $ "textareadescription" .val            + "\" }";       $.ajax {          type: "PUT",          url: " v1 albums.json",          contentType: 'application json',       request payload type          "content-type": "application json",      what we want back          data: json,          success:  function    resp  {              alert "Success! Going to album now" ;              window.location = " pages album " + $ "inputname" .val  ;          }      } ;  } ;         186  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   Adding Photo to Album    To add a photo to the album, you have to write a bit more complicated code. In the bootstrap- per, you need a list of all the albums so that the user can select to which album the photo  should be added. This code is shown in  Listing    8.5   .     Listing 8.5      admin_add_photo.js     $  function   {     var tmpl,      Main template HTML    tdata = {};     JSON data object that feeds the template        Initialize page    var initPage =  function    {            Load the HTML template        $.get " templates admin_add_photos.html", function d {            tmpl = d;        } ;            Retrieve the server data and then initialize the page        $.getJSON " v1 albums.json",  function    d  {            $.extend tdata, d.data ;        } ;            When AJAX calls are complete parse the template           replacing mustache tags with vars        $ document .ajaxStop  function      {            var renderedPage = Mustache.to_html  tmpl, tdata  ;            $ "body" .html  renderedPage  ;        }     }  ;  } ;     And finally, I leave you to look in the create_album  folder in the GitHub source for  Chapter    8    for the source of the HTML page that shows the form and performs the actual uploads to the  server  admin_add_photo.html . The big thing this file does is use the  FormData   extension to  the  XmlHttpRequest   object to allow Ajax file uploads, as shown here:      $ "inputsubmit_button" .click  function    e  {      var m = new Date  ;      var dateString =  * process m -- see GitHub *       $ "inputdate" .val dateString ;       var oOutput = document.getElementById "output" ;      var  oData   = new   FormData   document.forms.namedItem "add_photo"  ;   Recapping the App Structure  187       var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest  ;      var url = " v1 albums " + $ "albumid" .val   + " photos.json";      oReq.open "PUT", url, true ;      oReq.onload =  function  oEvent  {          if  oReq.status == 200  {              oOutput.innerHTML = "\  Uploaded! Continue adding or <a href=' pages album "                   + $ "albumid" .val   + "'>View Album ";          } else {              oOutput.innerHTML = "\  Error " + oReq.status + " occurred uploading your file. ";           }      };       oReq.send  oData  ;  } ;     FormData   is powerful and awesome but is not supported in Internet Explorer  IE  versions prior  to 10. Firefox, Chrome, and Safari have all supported it for quite a while. If you need to support  older IE browsers, you need to look at other methods for uploading files, such as using Flash or  otherwise regular old HTML Forms.     Recapping the App Structure    The application has gotten a bit more complicated; it is worth spending a few seconds again  covering exactly how you’ve structured it. You’ve moved all static content into the static   folder and the code into the app  folder, so you now have the following basic layout:     The static  folder contains the following sub-folders:        albums    —Contents of our albums and their image files        content    —Contains stylesheets and JavaScript bootstrapping files needed to render the   page templates        templates    —The HTML templates for rendering pages in the client browser     In the app  folder, you have:         .    —Contains the core server scripts and  package.json   files        data    —All code and classes related to working with the backend data store        handlers    —Contains the classes that are responsible for handling incoming requests     All the versions of your application from this point on will use this structure.                        188  Chapter 8  Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB   Summary    You now have not only a fully updated version of the photo album application that uses  MongoDB as its data store for albums and photos, but also a couple more interesting pages in  your web application for creating albums and uploading photos to the server.     The only problem is that anybody can view and use these pages and APIs to manipulate albums  and photos. So you next need to focus your attention on adding users and requiring that you  be logged in before making these changes.      9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL      Although the NoSQL databases are surging in popularity, there are still plenty of good reasons  to continue using relational databases, and they too remain just as popular as ever, especially  the two most common open source variants, MySQL and PostgreSQL. The good news is that  the asynchronous nature of Node.js meshes perfectly well with using these databases in your  web applications, and there is good  npm   module support for most of them.     In this chapter, I cover using MySQL with Node, using the mysql module from  npm . Because  you learned how to put your albums and photos in the database in the preceding chapter, you  can now turn your focus to registering users in the application and requiring them to be logged  in before creating any albums or adding any photos.     Even if you’re not planning on using traditional relational databases such as MySQL, it is  still worth your while to read through this chapter because I introduce a couple of important  features in express, as well as talk about  resource pooling , a way to control and limit the use  of precious system resources. You also update the photo albums sample so that albums and  photos will work with MySQL.     Getting Ready    You need to do two things before you can start playing around with MySQL in Node.js: Make  sure MySQL is installed and install the mysql  npm   module.     Installing MySQL    If you haven’t installed MySQL on your development machine yet, visit dev.mysql.com  downloads mysql and download the version of the community server most appropriate for  your machine. For Windows and Mac OS X, you can find downloadable installers, whereas  for Linux and other Unix systems, you can unpack .tar.gz archives to your preferred location   most typically  usr local mysql .      190  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL   If you’re running the installers for Windows or Mac OS X, they take care of everything for  you, whereas for binary distributions only, you have to read the INSTALL-BINARY text file and  follow the instructions in there to get MySQL fully up and running. When you’re done, you  should be able to start a new command prompt or terminal and run the  mysql   command:     Kimidori:Learning Node marcw$   usr local mysql bin mysql -u root Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g. Your MySQL connection id is 1 Server version: 5.5.29 MySQL Community Server  GPL   mysql>     Adding the mysql Module from npm    To install the mysql module for Node.js, you can modify the package.json and add the follow- ing under dependencies:     "dependencies": {   "async": "0.1.x",  "mysql": "2.x"  }     You should now see mysql  under node_modules  in your folder. Note that the  2.x   series of the  mysql module is a significant improvement and departure from the  0.x   series. Again, one of  the trickier parts of Node.js is that it’s constantly under development and improvement; things  are still changing quite a bit. You use the  2.x   series in this book because it’s much more robust  than what was there before.     Creating a Schema for the Database    When working with MySQL, you need to create a database schema for the application, which  you place in schema.sql. The first part of this is to create a database with UTF-8 as the default  character set and sorting order, as follows:     DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS  PhotoAlbums ;  CREATE DATABASE  PhotoAlbums      DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8    DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;  USE  PhotoAlbums ;     You then have to create a schema for your Users table, where you place information for regis- tered users of your photo-sharing app. You only need to require an email address, display  name, and password from the user, and store a couple extra pieces of information, including    Basic Database Operations  191  when the account was created, when it was last modified, and whether or not it’s been marked  as deleted. The Users table looks as follows:     CREATE TABLE  Users     user_uuid VARCHAR 50  UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,  email_address VARCHAR 150  UNIQUE,   display_name VARCHAR 100  NOT NULL,  password VARCHAR 100 ,   first_seen_date BIGINT,  last_modified_date BIGINT,  deleted BOOL DEFAULT false,   INDEX email_address ,  INDEX user_uuid     ENGINE = InnoDB;     Running all these commands in MySQL   mysql -u user -p secret < schema.sql   sets up  the appropriate database and table structures you need to begin writing code. If you’re follow- ing along with the code from the GitHub repository, you’ll notice that tables have been added  for albums and photos.     Basic Database Operations    Most of your work with MySQL will be limited to making connections to the MySQL server and  executing these queries and statements. This gives you more than enough to run your straight- forward web applications and extract much of the power of the database server.     Connecting    To connect to the remote server, you create a connection via the mysql module and then call  the  connect   function, as follows:     dbclient = mysql.createConnection {     host: "localhost",    user: "root",    password: "",    database: "PhotoAlbums"  } ;  dbclient.connect  function    err, results  { } ;      192  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL   If the connection fails, you get an error. If it succeeds, you can then use your client object to  execute queries. After finishing all your work with the database, you should close the connec- tion by calling the  end   method:     dbclient.end  ;     Adding Queries    After connecting to the database server, you can start executing queries with the  wait for it...   query   method, to which you pass the SQL statements you want executed:     dbclient.query "SELECT * FROM Albums ORDER BY date", function  err, results, fields   {} ;     If the query succeeds, the  results   parameter passed to the callback contains data relevant to  what you requested, and there is a third parameter,  fields , for those cases when you have  additional information to specify.  It is often empty when you don’t have such information.   For  SELECT   statements, the second parameter is an array of queried rows:     dbclient.query "SELECT * FROM Albums", function  err, rows  {     for  var i = 0; i < rows.length; i++  {        console.log " -> Album: " + rows[i].name                    + "  " + rows[i].date + " " ;    } } ;     If you are using  INSERT ,  UPDATE , or  DELETE , the results you get back from the  query   method  look more similar to the following:     { fieldCount: 0,   affectedRows: 0,  insertId: 0,  serverStatus: 2,  warningCount: 0,  message: '',  changedRows: 0 }     You can use this information to make sure that the number of affected rows is what you  expected it to be by looking at the  affectedRows   property, or you can get the autogenerated  ID of the last inserted row via the  insertId   property.     And that’s pretty much all there is to using MySQL in Node.js. Let’s put it to some serious use  then!     Adding Authentication to the Application    In the preceding chapter, I showed you how to convert the storage for albums and photos in  your application to use databases, but you have a problem in that your add album and add  photos pages are accessible by anybody anonymously. You can change your application to      Adding Authentication to the Application  193     Let new users register for the application.              Require a user to be logged in and registered before using the add album or photo pages.     Updating the API to Support Users    To support a new user subsystem, you need to add a couple of new routes to the API:     app.put ' v1 users.json', user_hdlr.register ; app.post ' service login', user_hdlr.login ;     The first is the CRUD method  see “API Design” in  Chapter    7   , “Building Web Applications with  Express”  for creating users through the API. The second is the way you support logins and  authentication for the web browser version of the application. I show the implementations for  these two methods later in the section “Creating the User Handler.”     Examining the Core User Data Operations    To get a connection to the database, create a data  folder for your application, and put—in  addition to a backend_helpers.js file containing some simple error-handling help—a file called  db.js there. This file is shown in  Listing    9.1   . Effectively, it provides a function to get a connec- tion to a MySQL database using connection information provided in the file local.config.js, as  you saw in  Chapter    8   , “Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB .”     Listing 9.1      db.js     var mysql = require 'mysql' ,     local = require ".. local.config.js" ;  exports. db   = function  callback  {     conn_props = local.config.db_config;    var c = mysql.createConnection {        host:     conn_props.host,        user:     conn_props.user,        password: conn_props.password,        database: conn_props.database    } ;    callback null, c ;  };     When you have a connection, you are responsible for closing it by calling the  end   method to  free up the resources it consumes. With this file in place, you can start implementing the back  end for the preceding new APIs in data user.js.      194  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL   Creating a User    The code to register a new user in the database is as follows:     exports. register   = function  email, display_name, password, callback  {     var dbc;    var userid;    async.waterfall [           validate ze params         function    cb  {                                               1.             if  !email  email.indexOf "@"  == -1                 cb backend.missing_data "email"  ;            else if  !display_name                 cb backend.missing_data "display_name"  ;            else if  !password                 cb backend.missing_data "password"  ;            else                cb null ;        },         function  cb  {            db.db cb ;        },          function    dbclient, cb  {            dbc = dbclient;            bcrypt.hash password, 10, cb ;                            3.         },         function    hash, cb  {            userid = uuid  ;                                          4.             dbc.query                                                 5a.                 "INSERT INTO Users VALUES  ?, ?, ?, ?, UNIX_TIMESTAMP  , NULL, 0 ",                [ userid, email, display_name, hash ],                cb ;        },          function    results, fields, cb  {                              5b.             exports.user_by_uuid userid, cb ;        }    ],     function    err, user_data  {        if  dbc    dbc.end  ;        if  err  {            if  err.code                &&  err.code == 'ER_DUP_KEYNAME'                     err.code == 'ER_EXISTS'                     err.code == 'ER_DUP_ENTRY'                  callback backhelp.user_already_registered   ;   Adding Authentication to the Application  195             else                callback  err ;        } else {            callback null, user_data ;        }    } ;  The code does the following:     };       3.    4.    1.     It validates the incoming parameters, in particular making sure the email address is semi- valid. You could be even stricter if you wanted and require activation of an account by  sending a link to that address.       2.     It gets a connection to the database.        It hashes the password using the bcrypt module. Bcrypt is a slow method of generating  passwords that makes brute-force attacks on them extremely difficult.        You generate a UUID for the user. You can use it later in the API to identify users. These  IDs are better than simple integer user IDs because they’re harder to guess and have no  obvious ordering.       5.     You execute the query to register the user in the database and finally ask the database to  return that just-created user back to the caller.     You use two new modules in this code,  bcrypt    for password encryption  and  node-uuid    to  generate the GUID that you use for the user identifier . You thus update the package.json file  with the following dependencies:      "dependencies": {    "express": "3.x",    "async": "0.1.x",    "mysql": "2.x",    "bcrypt": "0.x",    "node-uuid": "1.x"  } }     Also note that you store the account creation date as a  BIGINT   instead of a regular MySQL  DATETIME   field. I’ve found that, because JavaScript uses time stamps everywhere for dates  and times, it can be much easier to just store and manipulate them in databases as well.  Fortunately, MySQL provides a few functions to help you work with these dates.     Fetching a User  by Email Address or UUID     Now that you have a way to save users into the database, you can write the functions to bring  them back. First, write a generic function to find a user based on a particular field in the  database:      196  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL   function  user_by_field    field, value, callback  {     var dbc;    async.waterfall [         function    cb  {            db.db cb ;        },         function    dbclient, cb  {            dbc = dbclient;            dbc.query                 "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE " + field                    + " = ? AND deleted = false",                [ value ],                cb ;        },         function    rows, fields, cb  {            if  !rows  rows.length == 0                 cb backhelp.no_such_user   ;            else                cb null, rows[0] ;        }    ],     function    err, user_data  {        if  dbc  dbc.end  ;        callback err, user_data ;    } ;  Now, write the exported functions to fetch a user:     exports. user_by_uuid   = function  uuid, callback  {     if  !uuid         cb backend.missing_data "uuid"  ;    else        user_by_field "user_uuid", uuid, callback ;  exports. user_by_email   = function  email, callback  {     if  !email         cb backend.missing_data "email"  ;    else        user_by_field "email_address", email, callback ;  }     };  };     And that’s all you have for the data portion of user management. Everything else you do is on  the front-end handlers.      Adding Authentication to the Application  197  Updating the Express Application    The primary method the express server uses to remember whether a user is logged in is  session  cookies . Browsers send you cookies along with every request, so you use session data  which you  saw in “POST Data, Cookies, and Sessions” in  Chapter    7     to remember user login state. To set  up this capability, add the following lines to the top of server.js:     app.use express.cookieParser "secret text"  ; app.use express.cookieSession {     secret: "FLUFFY BUNNIES",    maxAge: 86400000,    store: new express.session.MemoryStore    }  ;     If a user is logged in, you set  req.session.logged_in = true   and set  req.session. logged_in_email_address   to a valid value. If a user is not logged in, these values are  undefined .     To make sure a user is logged in before using the admin pages you created in the preceding  chapter, you can introduce an extra little bit of express functionality that you haven’t seen yet:  the ability to inject your own middleware functions into routing declarations.     Normally, you would route a URL as follows:     app.get URL, HANDLER_FUNCTION ;     You can, however, insert any number of middleware functions between the URL and the  handler function. These are called one at a time in the order they’re listed. They are given three  parameters:  req ,  res , and  next . If they want to handle the request, they can process it and  send a response  and call  res.end  . If they do not, they can simply call the  next     function.     So, to require that a user be logged in for admin pages, change the URL routers for pages to the  following:     app.get ' pages :page_name',  requirePageLogin , page_hdlr.generate ; app.get ' pages :page_name :sub_page',  requirePageLogin , page_hdlr.generate ;     The  requirePageLogin   function checks to see whether the user is asking for a page that  requires authentication. If so, it then checks whether or not that user is logged in. If he is, it  allows processing to continue by calling  next   . If he is not logged in, it intercepts the URL  and redirects the user back to the login page:     function  requirePageLogin  req, res, next  {     if  req.params && req.params.page_name == 'admin'  {        if  req.session && req.session.logged_in  {            next  ;        } else {            res.redirect " pages login" ;        }    } else        next  ;  }      198  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL   Creating the User Handler    To support management of accounts, you can create a new user handler in handlers users.js.  Just as you did previously with albums and photos, you create a new  User   class that will help  you wrap users and also let you implement a  response_obj   method to filter out things you  don’t want to return:     function  User    user_data  {     this.uuid = user_data["user_uuid"];    this.email_address = user_data["email_address"];    this.display_name = user_data["display_name"];    this.password = user_data["password"];    this.first_seen_date = user_data["first_seen_date"];    this.last_modified_date = user_data["last_modified_date"];    this.deleted = user_data["deleted"];  }  User.prototype. uuid   = null; User.prototype. email_address   = null; User.prototype. display_name   = null; User.prototype. password   = null; User.prototype. first_seen_date   = null; User.prototype. last_modified_date   = null; User.prototype. deleted   = false; User.prototype. check_password   = function  pw, callback  {     bcrypt.compare pw, this.password, callback ;  }; User.prototype. response_obj   = function    {     return {        uuid: this.uuid,        email_address: this.email_address,        display_name: this.display_name,        first_seen_date: this.first_seen_date,        last_modified_date: this.last_modified_date    };  };     1.  2.  3.  4.  Creating a New User    Next, you implement the function to create a user. It basically does the following:        Checks the incoming data to make sure it’s valid.        Creates the user account with the back end and gets the raw data back again.        Marks the user as logged in.        Returns the newly created user object back to the caller.      Adding Authentication to the Application  199  This function looks like this:     exports. register   = function  req, res  {     async.waterfall [         function    cb  {                                                1.             var em = req.body.email_address;            if  !em  em.indexOf "@"  == -1                 cb helpers.invalid_email_address   ;            else if  !req.body.display_name                 cb helpers.missing_data "display_name"  ;            else if  !req.body.password                 cb helpers.missing_data "password"  ;            else                cb null ;        },         function    cb  {                                                2.             user_data.register                 req.body.email_address,                req.body.display_name,                req.body.password,                cb ;        },         function    user_data, cb  {                                     3.             req.session.logged_in = true;            req.session.logged_in_email_address = req.body.email_address;            req.session.logged_in_date = new Date  ;            cb null, user_data ;        }    ],     function    err, user_data  {                                        4.         if  err  {            helpers.send_failure res, err ;        } else {            var u = new User user_data ;            helpers.send_success res, {user: u.response_obj   } ;        }    } ;  };     Logging In a User    To log a user in to the system, you do the following:       1.     Fetch the user object for the given email address  and throw an error if that email address  does not exist .       2.     Compare the passwords using the bcrypt module.      200  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL     3.     Set the session variables to mark the user as logged in if the passwords match. Otherwise,   you mark the authentication as failed.     Here’s how it looks:     exports. login   = function  req, res  {     async.waterfall [         function    cb  {            var em = req.body.email_address;            if  !em  em.indexOf '@'  == -1                 cb helpers.invalid_email_address   ;            else if  req.session && req.session.logged_in_email_address                     == em.toLowerCase                   cb helpers.error "already_logged_in", ""  ;            else if  !req.body.password                 cb helpers.missing_data "password"  ;            else                user_data.user_by_email req.body.email_address, cb ;            1.         },         function    user_data, cb  {            var u = new User user_data ;            u.check_password req.body.password, cb ;                            2.         },         function    auth_ok, cb  {            if  !auth_ok  {                cb helpers.auth_failed   ;                return;            }            req.session.logged_in_email_address = req.body.email_address;       3.             req.session.logged_in_date = new Date  ;            cb null ;        }    ],     function    err, results  {        if  !err  err.message == "already_logged_in"  {            helpers.send_success res, { logged_in: true } ;        } else {            helpers.send_failure res, err ;        }    } ;  };     Testing for Logged-in Status    To test whether or not a user is logged in, you can just see if the appropriate session variable  is set:      Adding Authentication to the Application  201  exports.logged_in = function  req, res  {     var li =  req.session && req.session.logged_in_email_address ;    helpers.send_success res, { logged_in: li } ;  };     };     Logging Out    Finally, to log out, you just clear the session data, and the user is no longer considered logged  in to the system:     exports.logout = function  req, res  {     req.session = null;    helpers.send_success res, { logged_out: true } ;  Creating the Login and Register Pages    For the new user subsystem, you have two new pages in your application: a login page and a  registration page. Both are made up of two files, as usual: a JavaScript  bootstrapper   and an HTML  file. For both, the JavaScript bootstrapper is quite standard:     $  function   {     var tmpl,      Main template HTML    tdata = {};     JSON data object that feeds the template        Initialize page    var initPage =  function    {            Load the HTML template        $.get " templates   login OR register  .html", function d {            tmpl = d;        } ;            When AJAX calls are complete parse the template           replacing mustache tags with vars        $ document .ajaxStop  function      {            var renderedPage = Mustache.to_html  tmpl, tdata  ;            $ "body" .html  renderedPage  ;        } ;    }  ;  } ;     The HTML for the register page is shown in  Listing 9.2 . Apart from showing the HTML for the  registration form, it has some JavaScript to ensure that the user has entered all the fields, verify  that the two passwords match, and then submit the data to the back-end server. If the login  succeeds, you redirect back home; otherwise, you show an error and let the user try again.      202  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL   Listing 9.2      The Register Page Mustache Template  register.html        Login                 Email address:      <input type="text" size="30" id="email_address"               name="email_address" >      Display Name:             Password:             Password  confirm :                       $ document .ready  function      {     if  window.location.href.match   fail    != null  {        $ "error" .html "Failure creating account." ;    }  } ; $ "formregister" .submit  function    e  {   if  !$ "inputemail_address" .val         !$ "inputdisplay_name" .val         !$ "inputpassword" .val         !$ "inputpassword2" .val    {      $ "error" .html "You need to enter an email and password." ;  } else if  $ "inputpassword2" .val   != $ "inputpassword" .val    {      $ "error" .html "Passwords don't match." ;  } else {      var info = { email_address: $ "inputemail_address" .val  ,                   display_name: $ "inputdisplay_name" .val  ,                   password: $ "inputpassword" .val   };      $.ajax {          type: "PUT",          url: " v1 users.json",          data: JSON.stringify info ,          contentType: "application json; charset=utf-8",          dataType: "json",          success:  function    data  {              window.location = " pages admin home";          },          error:  function      {   Adding Authentication to the Application  203               var ext = window.location.href.match   fail    ? "" : "?fail";              window.location = window.location + ext;              return false;          }      } ;  }  return false;  } ;       Finally, the code for the login page is shown in  Listing 9.3 . It is quite similar to that for the  register page: It shows some HTML for the form and then has some JavaScript to process the  data and submit to the server.     Listing 9.3      The Login Page Mustache Template  login.html        Register                 Email address:      <input type="text" size="30" id="email_address"               name="email_address" >      Password:                       $ document .ready  function      {     if  window.location.href.match   fail    != null  {        $ "error" .html "Invalid login credentials." ;    }  } ; $ "formlogin" .submit  function    e  {   if  !$ "inputemail_address" .val    !$ "inputpassword" .val    {      $ "error" .html "You need to enter an email and password." ;  } else {      var info = { email_address: $ "inputemail_address" .val  ,                   password: $ "inputpassword" .val   };      $.ajax {          type: "POST",          url: " service login",          data: JSON.stringify info ,          contentType: "application json; charset=utf-8",   204  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL            dataType: "json",          success:  function    data  {              window.location = " pages admin home";          },          error:  function      {              var ext = window.location.href.match   fail    ? "" : "?fail";              window.location = window.location + ext;              return false;          }      } ;  }  return false;  } ;       And with those new files  data user.js and handlers users.js, login.js and login.html, and regis- ter.js and register.html , you have a complete login system for your web browser front end.     Resource Pooling    In the preceding chapter, you saw that the MongoDB driver for Node.js managed its own  collection of connections, or “pool” of connections. The mysql module does not do this for  you, so you have to come up with your own connection pooling mechanism. Fortunately, it’s  so trivial to do this that you don’t need to worry at all that the module doesn’t implement this  capability.     In  npm , a module called  generic-pool   allows for pooling of, well, anything. To use it, you  create a pool, specify the upper limit on the number of items you’d like to create, and provide a  function to create a new instance of an object in the pool. Then, to get an item from the pool,  you call the  acquire   function, which waits until a pool object is available for use. When you  are done, you call the  release   function to return the object back to the pool.     Let’s see this in action.     Getting Started    Add  generic-pool   to the package.json dependencies:      "dependencies": {    "express": "3.x",    "async": "0.1.x",     "generic-pool": "2.x",     "mysql": "2.x",    "bcrypt": "0.x",    "node-uuid": "1.x"  }      Authenticating the API  205  To include it in a file, you require it as follows:     var pool = require 'generic-pool' ,     To create a pool, you create a new instance of the pool class with some configuration informa- tion, namely the number of pool items you want, and the function to create a new object:     conn_props = local.config.db_config; mysql_pool = pool.Pool {     name     : 'mysql',    create   :  function    callback  {        var c = mysql.createConnection {            host:     conn_props.host,            user:     conn_props.user,            password: conn_props.password,            database: conn_props.database        } ;        callback null, c ;    },    destroy           :  function    client  { client.end  ; },    max               : conn_props.pooled_connections,    idleTimeoutMillis : conn_props.idle_timeout_millis,    log               : false  } ;     Working with Connections    Now, in the code, whenever you want a connection to your MySQL server, instead of creating a  new one, you can just let the pool manage all this for you. The  acquire   function blocks until a  connection is available for you to use. The previous  db   function in db.js becomes     exports. db   = function  callback  {     mysql_pool.acquire callback ;  };     And when you’re done with the connection, you can just release it back to the connection pool  as follows:     conn.release  ;     Anybody else waiting for a connection gets it right away.     Authenticating the API    Now, you’re probably sitting around feeling quite smug knowing that your application properly  checks that you’re logged in before letting you create albums or add photos to an album, but  you still have one major security problem: The API itself is not at all secure. You can still run  the following without being challenged:      206  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL   curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application json" \      -d '{ "name": "hk2012", "title" : "moo", "description": "cow", "date":   "2012-12-28" }'\      http:  localhost:8080 v1 albums.json     The system isn’t that impressive if only some parts of it are secure but others are wide open!  You can fix that issue right now.     You can create a system through which              The web browser front end continues to use the login and register pages and login service   to manage access to the server.        API users will use  HTTP Basic Authentication   passing a username and password along with   the request to authenticate access to restricted APIs.     HTTP Basic Authentication: Is It Secure?    As I explain in this chapter,  HTTP Basic Authentication   is a relatively simple form of security:  The client passes a header with a username and password base64 encoded to the server  with every request, which is authenticated by the server before processing it. Because base64  encoding is not a form of encryption, it amounts to passing plain-text usernames and pass- words over the Internet. So you must ask: Is that fundamentally insecure?    The answer is, largely, no. Most secured portions of websites are encrypted and sent over the  network using SSL HTTPS. This method of sending encrypted traffic between a client and serv- er is pretty safe, and something you should absolutely set up on your servers as well.    Other people argue that web browsers remember Basic Auth usernames and passwords, and  this can be insecure. This argument is valid, and this is why you use Basic Auth only for API  servers. For browser-based applications, you should stick with regular login pages and session  cookies.    So, although HTTP Basic Authentication  can   be insecure, with a little preparation and precau- tion, there is no reason it cannot be a reliable production-level security system for your REST  API servers.     Clients do not remember sessions from API users, because they are not passing cookies around,  so no login state is stored. Thus, these users need to authenticate every single request. To do  this, they pass headers of the following format:     Authorization: Basic  username:password base64 encoded     For example, to send the credentials for  marcwan@example.org   with the password kittycaton- keyboard, you would send     Authorization: Basic bWFyY3dhbkBleGFtcGxlLm9yZzpraXR0eWNhdG9ua2V5Ym9hcmQ=      Authenticating the API  207  Fortunately, you don’t have to compute these headers yourself, because programs such as  curl    do the job for you. To pass HTTP Basic Authentication information with a  curl   request, you  can just add the following to your request:     curl   -u username:password    ...     So, you can secure those APIs that can make changes to your system: the two  PUT   APIs for  creating albums and adding photos to albums. To do so, write a new piece of middleware called  requireAPILogin :     app.put ' v1 albums.json',  requireAPILogin , album_hdlr.create_album ; app.put ' v1 albums :album_name photos.json',          requireAPILogin , album_hdlr.add_photo_to_album ;     The  requireAPILogin   function is as follows:     function  requireAPILogin  req, res, next  {     if  req.session && req.session.logged_in  {                                 1.         next  ;        return;    }    var rha = req.headers.authorization;                                        2.     if  rha && rha.search 'Basic '  === 0  {        var creds = new Buffer rha.split ' ' [1], 'base64' .toString  ;        var parts = creds.split ":" ;                                           3.         user_hdlr.authenticate_API                                              4.             parts[0],            parts[1],            function  err, resp  {                if  !err && resp  {                    next  ;                } else                    need_auth req, res ;            }         ;    } else        need_auth req, res ;  }       1.  The code works as follows:        To maintain compatibility with the web application, you check to see whether the user  has already logged in using sessions in the browser. If so, this user is clear to use any API  she wants. Because pure API calls from the command line or most simple clients don’t  pass around cookies  whereas Ajax calls to the API in the browser  do  , there is no session,  and additional authentication information has to be provided.      208  Chapter 9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL     2.     You look in the headers for the  Authentication:   header.       3.     You decode and break apart the username and password from the header.       4.     You pass that information along to the  authenticate_API   function in the user handler.     The  authenticate_API   function in the user handler is as follows—It fetches the user given her  email address, validates the password using the bcrypt  npm   module, and then returns success or  failure:     exports. authenticate_API   = function  un, pw, callback  {     async.waterfall [         function    cb  {            user_data.user_by_email un, cb ;        },          function    user_data, cb  {            var u = new User user_data ;            u.check_password pw, cb ;        }    ],     function    err, results  {        if  !err  {            callback null, un ;        } else {            callback new Error "bogus credentials"  ;        }    } ;  };     }     function  need_auth  req, res  {     res.header 'WWW-Authenticate',               'Basic realm="Authorization required"' ;    if  req.headers.authorization  {           no more than 1 failure   5s        setTimeout function    {            res.send 'Authentication required\n', 401 ;        }, 3000 ;    } else {        res.send 'Authentication required\n', 401 ;    }  Finally, if you determine that a user has not properly authenticated his request, you need to do  a bit of work to tell him that he is not allowed to use the requested resource:     This function completes the API server obligations for HTTP Basic Authentication. If authen- tication fails, it returns the response header  WWW-Authenticate . For a bit of extra security, if  you see the user is sending incorrect username password combinations, you can sleep for a few    Summary  209  seconds to further discourage brute-force attacks. And with that, you now have a reasonably  secure web and API server for your photo-sharing application.     To truly secure it, you should make sure that any request requiring a password being sent to  you is secured with HTTPS so that nobody is able to use a packet sniffer to see any passwords  over the wire. I discuss HTTPS in more detail in  Chapter    10   , “Deployment and Development.”     Summary    I threw two new things at you in this chapter: using MySQL databases in your Node applica- tions and adding user authentication to both your web apps and your API servers. For this  chapter, I also updated the MongoDB version of the application with the user authentication  subsystem in the GitHub tree, so you’re welcome to explore how things are done there as well.  By creating two parallel authentication systems, you work to create a good user experience for  your browser application, while letting API users still get the full simplicity and power of the  JSON API.     In closing out this third part of the book, you learned how to add some powerful new tech- nologies to the photo-sharing application including express and databases, and created a fully  functioning  if basic  project on which you can build. In the last part of the book, I cover some  of the details I have been glossing over thus far in the book. First up, in  Chapter    10   , you learn  how to deploy your applications.      9  Databases II: SQL  MySQL      Although the NoSQL databases are surging in popularity, there are still plenty of good reasons  to continue using relational databases, and they too remain just as popular as ever, especially  the two most common open source variants, MySQL and PostgreSQL. The good news is that  the asynchronous nature of Node.js meshes perfectly well with using these databases in your  web applications, and there is good  npm   module support for most of them.     In this chapter, I cover using MySQL with Node, using the mysql module from  npm . Because  you learned how to put your albums and photos in the database in the preceding chapter, you  can now turn your focus to registering users in the application and requiring them to be logged  in before creating any albums or adding any photos.     Even if you’re not planning on using traditional relational databases such as MySQL, it is  still worth your while to read through this chapter because I introduce a couple of important  features in express, as well as talk about  resource pooling , a way to control and limit the use  of precious system resources. You also update the photo albums sample so that albums and  photos will work with MySQL.     Getting Ready    You need to do two things before you can start playing around with MySQL in Node.js: Make  sure MySQL is installed and install the mysql  npm   module.     Installing MySQL    If you haven’t installed MySQL on your development machine yet, visit dev.mysql.com  downloads mysql and download the version of the community server most appropriate for  your machine. For Windows and Mac OS X, you can find downloadable installers, whereas  for Linux and other Unix systems, you can unpack .tar.gz archives to your preferred location   most typically  usr local mysql .      Part IV  Getting the Most  Out of Node.js  10 Deployment and Development    213      11 Command-Line Programming      233      12 Testing    253      This page intentionally left blank    10  Deployment and  Development     With the ability to build nontrivial Node.js applications firmly under your belt, you can now   turn your attention to some additional topics on deployment and development of these apps.  In this chapter, you start by looking at some of the various ways that people deploy and run  their Node apps on production servers, looking at both UNIX Mac and Windows options. You  also see how you can take advantage of multiprocessor machines, despite the fact that Node.js  is a single-threaded platform.     You then move on to look at adding support for virtual hosts on the server, as well as securing  your applications with SSL HTTPS support. Finally, you take a quick look at some of the issues  with multiplatform development when you have people working on a Node app with both  Windows and UNIX Mac machines.     Deployment    To run your Node.js applications thus far, you’ve just been using the following from the  command line:     node script_name.js     This approach works pretty great for development. However, for deploying your applications to  live servers, you might want to add in an extra layer of reliability to help in those cases when  they crash. Although you, of course, strive to avoid bugs in your servers, some will eventually  creep in, so you’d like to have your servers recover as quickly as possible from such problems.     Let’s look at some of the options now.      214  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development  Port Numbers    For most of this book, you have been using very high port numbers for your sample apps, most  frequently 8080. The reason is that on some operating systems, most notably UNIX Mac OS X  systems, port numbers below 1024 require super-user access. So, for simple debugging and  testing, 8080 is a great alternative to the more common port 80 for web traffic.    However, when you deploy your live applications, you frequently want them to run on port 80  because this is the default for web browsers. To do this, you need to run the scripts as super- user. The two ways of doing this are     1. 2.     Log in to your system as the super-user and run programs that way.       Use the  sudo   command, which elevates the process to be executed to super-user privi- leges when it actually runs.     Of these two strategies, I most frequently use the latter.     Level: Basic    At the most basic level, you can just use an infinite loop to run your scripts. This loop just  automatically restarts the  node   process whenever it crashes out. On UNIX and Mac computers  running  bash , the script can be as simple as     ! bin bash while true do  done        node script_name.js  : loop node script_name.js goto loop : end     On Windows, you can use batch files to do the job for you, as follows  save this to run_script. bat or something similar and run it :     These scripts make sure that your Node process is always restarted in the event that it crashes  or is terminated accidentally.     You can actually go one step further and use a command called  tee   to write the standard  output of the node process to a log file. You usually  pipe   the output of your process to the  tee command using the      “pipe”  operator in the command line, and  tee   then reprints the output  on the standard output in addition to writing to the specified log file, as follows:     node hello_world.js  tee -a  var server logs important.log     The  -a   flag to  tee   tells it to append to the specified log file instead of simply overwriting it.  Thus, you can improve your deployment one step further by running your scripts as follows:     bash . run_script.sh  tee –a  var server logs important.log      Deployment  215  Or, on Windows, you can use the following:     run_script.bat  tee –a  var server logs important.log     See the sidebar “Tee for Windows” for more information on actually making this technique  work.     Tee for Windows  and Other Useful Commands     The Windows shells are not known for being particularly powerful  although PowerShell is a  nice step in the right direction . To get around this issue, people often download external utility  packs that let them get some of the cool scripting functionality seen on UNIX platforms such as  Linux or Mac OS X.    For the  tee   program mentioned in this chapter, two good choices of utilities are              http:  getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net        http:  unxutils.sourceforge.net      You can also find specific  tee   utilities for Windows by simply searching for “Windows tee.”  Indeed, for many of the UNIX-like tools I’ve been describing throughout this book, perfectly func- tioning Windows alternatives or versions frequently are available for them.     Using screen to Monitor the Output    Although you are always logged in on Windows and can easily log back in to the desktop to  see what is going on with your Node servers, on UNIX servers such as Linux or Mac OS X, you  frequently want to log out and just leave the servers running. The problem is that when you do  this, you lose your standard output   stdout   handle and the output is lost, unless you are also  writing to a log file. And even then, the log file sometimes is missing important information  printed out by either Node or the OS regarding problems they   encounter.     To get around this issue, most UNIX systems support a magical little utility called  screen ,  which lets you run programs as if they constantly have a controlling terminal  also known as a  tty  , even if you are logged out. Installation is specific to your platform, but Mac OS X has it by  default, and most Linux platforms can get it by doing something similar to  apt-get screen .     Now, before you run your Node server, you can run  screen   and then run Node within that.  To detach from  screen , you press the key sequence Ctrl+A Ctrl+D. To get back into the screen,  you run the command  screen -r    for resume . If you have multiple  screen   sessions running,  they each have a name and you also have to type in the name of the session you want to  resume.     You use  screen   for every single Node server you have running. It’s a great way to come back  every once in a while and browse how things are running.      216  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development  Level: Ninja    The previous scripts for running applications are pretty useful, and you can use them for low- traffic sites that don’t crash very often. They do have a couple of serious limitations, however:       1.     If an app gets into a state where it is constantly crashing, even when restarted, these   scripts blindly keep restarting it, resulting in what is known as a “run-away process.” You  never get it to start properly, and your server will work itself to death constantly trying.       2.     Although these scripts can keep your processes up and running, they don’t do a good job  of telling you when they’re in trouble, specifically if they’re using up too much memory.  There are still instances where a Node process can consume a bit too much memory or  otherwise get into trouble with system resources. It would be great if there were a way to  detect this and terminate them and let them start again from scratch.     Thus, in the following sections, you look at a couple of more advanced deployment options,  which start to deviate quite greatly for UNIX and Windows at this point.     Linux Mac    The previous version of your script  when viewed as pseudo-code  was effectively     You can upgrade this script now to do something more along the following lines:     while 1       run node  end     PID = run node while 1       sleep a few seconds      if PID not running         restart = yes      else        check node memory usage        if using too much memory           restart = yes       if restart and NOT too many restarts         PID = restart node  end     There are two key tasks you need to perform to make this work:       1.     Get the process ID   pid   of the last-started  node   server.       2.     Figure out how much memory the  node   process is using.     For the first, you use the  pgrep   command, available on Mac and most UNIX platforms. When  used with the  -n   flag, it gives you the process ID of the latest instance of the given process    Deployment  217  name. You can also use the  -f   flag to tell it to match the name of the script, in case your  computer is running multiple Node servers. Thus, to get the  pid   of the latest created Node  process running script_name.js, you use     pgrep -n -f "node script_name.js"     Now, to get the amount of memory that your process is using, you need to use two commands.  The first is the  ps   command, which, when given the  wux     wup   on some platforms—check your  documentation  flags, tells you the total virtual memory consumption of the process, as well as  the current resident size  the one you want . The output of  ps wux $    pid    is as follows:     USER    PID  %CPU %MEM      VSZ    RSS   TT  STAT STARTED      TIME COMMAND marcw  1974   6.6  3.4  4507980 571888   ??  R    12:15AM  52:02.42 command name     You want the sixth column  RSS  of the second line of this output. To get this, you have to first  run the  awk   command to get the second line only, and then you run it again to get the value  in the sixth column, as follows:     ps wux $PID  awk 'NR>1'  awk '{print $6}'     With the amount of memory this process is consuming, you can make a decision as to whether  it’s using too much and then terminate and restart it if necessary.     I won’t print out the full code of the shell script here, but you can see it in the code for  Chapter    10   in the GitHub repository, as node_ninja_runner.sh. To use it, you can run it as     node_ninja_runner.sh server.js  [extra params]     You do, of course, need to make sure it’s elevated to super-user privileges if you’re going to  listen on a port such as 80 or 443.     Windows    On Windows, the best way to run your apps in a reliable way that can be monitored would be  to use a Windows Service. Node.js itself is not set up to be a Windows Service, but fortunately  you can use some tricks to get it to behave like one.     Through the use of a nice little program called  nssm.exe    the  Non-Sucking Service Manager    and an  npm   module called  winser , you can install your Node web applications as services and  manage them fully through the Windows Management Console. To set this up, you need to do  two things:       1.     Install a new custom action in the package.json for the web application.       2.     Download and install winser and have it do its work.     For the first step, you just need to add the following to the package.json file:     {   "name": "Express-Demo",  "description": "Demonstrates Using Express and Connect",   218  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development   "version": "0.0.1",  "private": true,  "dependencies": {    "express": "3.x"  },    "scripts": {      "start": "node 01_express_basic.js"     } }     For the second step, you can just do the following:     C:\Users\Mark\LearningNode\Chapter10>  npm install winser      Or you can add winser to your dependencies.  Then, when you are ready to install your app as  a service, you can go to the project folder holding the package.json for the app and run     C:\Users\Mark\LearningNode\Chapter10>  node_modules\.bin\winser -i The program Express-Demo was installed as a service.     To uninstall the service, just run  winser -r , as follows:     C:\Users\Mark\LearningNode\Chapter10>  node_modules\.bin\winser -r The service for Express-Demo was removed.     You can then go to the Windows Management Console and start, stop, pause, or otherwise  manage the service to your heart’s content!     Multiprocessor Deployment: Using a Proxy    I’ve mentioned many times that Node.js effectively operates as a single-threaded process: All  the code that your scripts are executing is in the same thread, and you use asynchronous call- backs to get as much efficiency out of your CPU as possible.     However, you must then ask the question: What do you do on a system with multiple CPUs?  How can you extract maximal functionality out of your servers? Many modern servers are nice  powerful 8–16 core machines, and you’d like to use all of them if possible.     Fortunately, the answer is reasonably simple: Just run one node process per core you want to  utilize  see  Figure    10.1    . You can choose one of a number of strategies to route incoming traffic  to the various different node processes, as suits your requirements.      The problem you are now faced with is that you have not one, but  n   Node processes running,  all of which must listen on a different port.  You can’t have multiple people listening on the  same port number.  How do you get traffic to  mydomain:80   to these servers?      Multiprocessor Deployment: Using a Proxy  219  Figure 10.1      Running multiple node processes for the same app     You can solve this problem by implementing a simple round-robin  load balancer   that is given  a list of node servers running your particular web application. You then redirect incoming  requests to your domain to these other servers, one at a time. You can, of course, experiment  with more advanced strategies that monitor load, availability, or responsiveness.     To implement the load balancer, you first compile a list of servers that you are running. Say  you have a server with four cores; you give three of them over to the app  and leave the fourth  for running other system services . You run these app servers on ports 8081, 8082, and 8083.  Thus, your list of servers is     { "servers": [ {     "host": "localhost",    "port": "8081"  }, {  }, {     "host": "localhost",    "port": "8082"     "host": "localhost",    "port": "8083"  } ] }     The code for these simple servers is shown in  Listing    10.1   . It is the most simple web server  that you’ve seen in this book, with an additional bit of code to get the port number on which  it should listen from the command line.  You learn more about command-line parameters in  Chapter    11   , “Command-Line Programming.”       220  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development  Listing 10.1      Trivial HTTP Server     var http = require 'http' ;  if  process.argv.length != 3  {     console.log "Need a port number" ;    process.exit -1 ;  var s = http.createServer  function    req, res  {     res.end "I listened on port " + process.argv[2] ;  }  } ;  {  s.listen process.argv[2] ;     $ node simple.js 8081 & $ node simple.js 8082 & $ node simple.js 8083 &     node simple.js 8081 node simple.js 8082 node simple.js 8083     You can launch your three servers on UNIX Mac platforms by typing     On Windows platforms, you can launch them by simply running the following three  commands in different command prompts:     You can now build your proxy server using the  npm   module  http-proxy . The package.json looks  as follows:      "name": "Round-Robin-Demo",  "description": "A little proxy server to round-robin requests",  "version": "0.0.1",  "private": true,  "dependencies": {     "http-proxy": "0.8.x"   } }     The code for the proxy is quite simple, as shown in  Listing    10.2   . It basically maintains an array  of available servers, as shown previously, and then for each request coming to the service,  cycles through those available servers and forwards on the requests to them.      Multiprocessor Deployment: Using a Proxy  221  Listing 10.2      A Round-Robin Proxy Load Balancer  roundrobin.js      var httpProxy = require 'http-proxy' ,      fs = require 'fs' ;  var servers = JSON.parse fs.readFileSync 'server_list.json'  .servers;  var s = httpProxy.createServer  function    req, res, proxy  {     var target = servers.shift  ;               1.   Remove first server    proxy.proxyRequest req, res, target ;       2.   Re-route to that server    servers.push target ;                       3.   Add back to end of list  } ;  s.listen 8080 ;     To put all this in action, you now run  node roundrobin.js , and you can start to query it as  follows:     curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080     As you run this command multiple times, you should see the output showing the actual port  number that is being listened to for the current processing server.     Multiple Servers and Sessions    Running multiple servers on different CPUs and servers is a great way to spread the load and  give you a cheap path to scalability.  Servers under heavy load? Just add more!  But they create  one small complication that you need to address before you can use them effectively: The  session data is currently stored per process using local  MemoryStore   objects  see “POST Data,  Cookies, and Sessions” in  Chapter    7   , “Building Web Applications with Express” . This creates a  rather serious problem, as shown in  Figure    10.2   .      Because each Node server stores its own record of sessions in its own memory store, when two  requests from the same client go to two different node processes, they have different ideas of  current state of the session data from the client and get horribly confused quickly. You have  two obvious ways to solve this problem:       1.     Implement a more advanced router that remembers to which Node server requests from  a particular client are being sent and ensure that all traffic continues to be routed in the  same way for the same client.       2.     Somehow pool the memory stores that the session data uses so that all Node processes  can access it.     I prefer the second solution because it is quite simple to implement and a much less compli- cated solution.      222  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development  1. Client calls server, routed to server 1  2. Server creates session_XYZ, returns data  3. Client calls server, routed to server 2, passes session_XYZ cookie  4. Server has never seen this ID before, creates new session  Figure 10.2      Multiple instances of the servers and session data     To set up this solution, you need to first choose a pooled memory store. The obvious candi- dates for this are  memcached   and  Redis , both of which are effectively large  memory-based key  value stores   that can be spread across different computers. You work with memcached in this  chapter because it’s entirely adequate for your needs and extremely lightweight. Your setup  should look similar to that shown in  Figure    10.3   .      Installation on Windows    For Windows users, you can install one of the many binary installers for memcached available  with a simple Internet search. You don’t need the latest and greatest version; anything in the  1.2.x series or later is fine. To install it as a service, you then run     c:\memcached\memcached -d install     You can then run the memcached service by typing     net start memcached     And finally, you can edit HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE SYSTEM CurrentControlSet Services  memcached Server and modify the ImagePath to be     "C: memcached memcached.exe" -d runservice -m 25      Multiprocessor Deployment: Using a Proxy  223  Figure 10.3      Using memory-based key value stores to implement sessions     to set the amount of memory available to memcached to be 25MB, which is usually more than  enough for development.  You can choose whatever values you want here, of course.  It listens  on port 11211.     Installation on Mac and UNIX-like Systems    If you’re on a system with some sort of packaging manager, you can often use something like   you might need  sudo   for this      apt-get install memcached     and you’re good to go. If you want to build from source, you first need to get  libevent   from  http:  libevent.org . Download, build, and install  as super-user  the library. It should place the  service in  usr local lib.     Next, visit memcached.org and download the latest source tarball  .tar.gz file  and configure,  build, and install it as well. Again, do so as super-user.     To run memcached after it is installed, run the following command:      usr local bin memcached -m 100 -p 11211 -u daemon     This command tells the service to run using 100MB of memory and listen on port 11211,  running as the user  daemon . It typically refuses to run as  root .      224  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development  Getting memcached into express    Now that you have memcached installed and running  assume localhost on port 11211 ,  you need to get a  MemoryStore   object for it so that you can use it for your session data.  Fortunately, the Node.js community is so active that there’s already an  npm   module called  connect-memcached . So, let’s add the following to your  dependencies   in package.json:     "connect-memcached": "0.0.x"     Then you can modify your session creation code as follows:     var express = require 'express' ;     pass the express obj so connect-memcached can inherit from MemoryStore var MemcachedStore = require 'connect-memcached'      express     ;  var mcds = new MemcachedStore { hosts: "localhost:11211" } ;   var app = express       .use express.logger 'dev'      .use express.cookieParser       .use express.session { secret: "cat on keyboard",                           cookie: { maxAge: 1800000 },                           store:  mcds }      .use function req, res {        var x = req.session.last_access;        req.session.last_access = new Date  ;        res.end "You last asked for this page at: " + x ;    }     .listen 8080 ;     Now, all the Node servers can be configured to use the same  MemoryStore   for session data and  will be able to fetch the correct information, no matter where the request is processed.     Virtual Hosting    Running multiple websites on one server has been a major requirement of web application plat- forms for many years now, and fortunately Node.js offers a couple of very workable solutions  here for you when you build your apps with express.     You implement virtual hosting by adding the  Host:   header to the incoming HTTP request, one  of the major features in HTTP 1.1  see  Figure    10.4    .       Virtual Hosting  225  Figure 10.4      The basic idea behind virtual hosting     Built-in Support    The ability to run multiple virtual hosts is built directly into express. To make it work, you  create one express server for each host you want to support and then another “master” server  that is given the other virtual servers and routes requests to them as appropriate. Finally, you  use the  vhost   connect middleware component to put this all together. The code is shown in  Listing    10.3   .     Listing 10.3      Virtual Hosts in Express  vhost_server.js      var express = require 'express' ;  var  one   = express  ; one.get " ", function req, res {    res.send "This is app one!"   } ;     App two var  two   = express  ;   226  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development  two.get " ", function req, res {    res.send "This is app two!"      App three var  three   = express  ; three.get " ", function req, res {    res.send "This is app three!"   } ;  } ;     controlling app var  master_app   = express  ;  master_app.use express.logger 'dev'  ; master_app.use express. vhost  'app1',  one    master_app.use express. vhost  'app2',  two   ; master_app.use express. vhost  'app3',  three   ;  master_app.listen 8080 ;     Testing Virtual Hosts    Testing virtual hosts can be a bit of a challenge because your servers are all running on local- host, but you need to somehow get the server to recognize the name of the requested server.    If you’re testing from the command line using  curl , you can just add a header to your request  to specify which host you are requesting, as follows:     curl –X GET -H "Host: hostname1.com" http:  localhost:8080     However, if you want to test things out in the browser, you need to modify the DNS entries on  your machine. The most common way to do this is to edit   etc hosts    on UNIX Mac machines   or  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts . You must do this with elevated permissions.  On UNIX Mac, you launch your editor with  sudo , whereas on Windows, you can simply use  Notepad, but make sure you run it with Administrator privileges.    Then you can add entries of the following format to the file:     127.0.0.1        hostname     Here, 127.0.0.1 is the IPv4 address for your local computer, and next to it, you just put the  name you want to map to that address. You can add as many lines for as many hosts as you  want  for example,  app1 ,  app2 , and  app3  .    Between these two options, you should have no problems testing virtual hosts, either from the  command line or the browser.      Securing Your Projects with HTTPS SSL  227  Proxy Server Support    Although it’s cool that express has built-in support for virtual hosts, I worry a bit about the  risks of having multiple web applications running within one process. If any one starts to  misbehave or have problems, any number of your sites can start to have problems as well.     To get around this situation, let’s look at another way of managing virtual hosts using the http- proxy module again. Because this module is so powerful, it can easily handle routing of traffic  to different virtual hosts in only a few lines of code. Indeed, to route traffic based only on the  host names of the sites, you can run the code listed in  Listing    10.4   .     Listing 10.4      Proxy server virtual hosts  proxy_vhosts_server.js      var httpProxy = require 'http-proxy' ;  var options = {   hostnameOnly: true,  router: {    'app1': '127.0.0.1:8081',    'app2': '127.0.0.1:8082',    'app3': '127.0.0.1:8083'  }  }  var proxyServer = httpProxy.createServer options ; proxyServer.listen 8080 ;     You give the proxy server a list of hosts to look for and where to route incoming traffic for  those hosts. To test this, you can again simply run the three different app servers and then run  the proxy server, making it the target of all your traffic.     Securing Your Projects with HTTPS SSL    For those parts of your application that handle sensitive data such as user passwords or  personal data, bank account or payment information, or indeed anything else somewhat  private in nature, you should secure your applications with SSL-encrypted HTTPS traffic.  Although there is some overhead in creating the SSL connection and encrypting the traffic, the  security benefits are, of course, of paramount importance.     To add support for SSL HTTPS to your applications, you need to first generate some test certifi- cates and then add support for the encrypted traffic to the application. For the latter, you again  have two ways of doing this: either through built-in support in express or by using a proxy  server.      228  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development  Generating Test Certificates    To work with encrypted traffic on your development machines, you need to generate some test  certificates. You need to generate two files—privkey.pem and newcert.pem—the private key and  certificate, respectively. All UNIX Mac machines come with a tool called  openssl   that you can  use to generate these two files.     For Windows users, you can download a Win32 version of  openssl.exe   by visiting   http:  gnuwin32.sourceforge.net packages openssl.htm . Then the commands you run are  the same as on the other platforms.     To generate the two certificate files, run the following three commands:     openssl genrsa -out  privkey.pem   1024 openssl req -new -key privkey.pem -out certreq.csr openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in certreq.csr -signkey privkey.pem -out  newcert.pem     With these two files in hand, you can work on using them in your apps. Note that you should  never use them in production sites; if you attempt to view a website in a browser secured with  these certificates, you get a horribly loud and dangerous-sounding warning about how they are  not to be trusted at all. You typically have to purchase production certificates from a trusted  certificate authority.     Built-in Support    Not surprisingly, Node.js and express provide support for SSL HTTPS streams right out of the  box, via the built-in https module provided by Node. You can actually run an https module  server to do the listening on the HTTPS port  by default 443, but for development, you can use  8443 to avoid having to elevate permissions of your Node process , and then it routes traffic to  the express server after the encrypted stream has been negotiated and created.     You create the HTTPS server and pass in as options the locations of the private key and certifi- cate file you plan to use to sign the site. You also give it the express server to which it can send  traffic after encryption is established. The code for this support is shown in  Listing    10.5   .     Listing 10.5      Express https Module SSL Support  https_express_server.js      var express = require 'express' ,     https = require 'https' ,    fs = require 'fs' ;      1.   Load certificates and create options var privateKey = fs.readFileSync 'privkey.pem' .toString  ; var certificate = fs.readFileSync 'newcert.pem' .toString  ; var options = {     key : privateKey,    cert : certificate  }   Securing Your Projects with HTTPS SSL  229      2.   Create express app and set up routing, etc. var app = express  ; app.get "*",  function    req, res  {       res.end "Thanks for calling securely!\n" ;  } ;  } ;         3.   start https server with options and express app. https.createServer options, app .listen 8443,  function   {    console.log "Express server listening on port 8443" ;  You can view these encrypted pages in a web browser by entering  https:  localhost:8443 in the address bar. The first time you view them, you get a scary warning about how insecure  they are.     Proxy Server Support    As with many of the other things you’re investigating in this chapter, you can also use the  remarkably powerful http-proxy module to handle SSL HTTPS traffic for you. Using this  module has a couple of key advantages over using built-in support for HTTPS in that you let  the actual app servers run as regular HTTP servers, leaving them “hidden” behind the HTTPS  proxy server and freeing them from tedious encryption work. You can then also run as many  as you want using round-robin load balancing seen previously, or look at other creative ways to  set up your configuration.     The methodology for this support isn’t terribly different from that used in the previous  example with express; you create an instance of Node’s built-in HTTPS server class and also  create an instance of a proxy server that knows to route traffic to a regular HTTP server  the app  server . You then run the HTTPS server, and when it has established the secure connection, it  passes the request to the proxy server, which in turn passes it to the app server s . The code for  this support is shown in  Listing    10.6   .     Listing 10.6      http-proxy SSL Support  https_proxy_server.js      var fs = require 'fs' ,     http = require 'http' ,    https = require 'https' ,    httpProxy = require 'http-proxy' ;      1.   Get certificates ready. var options = {     https: {        key: fs.readFileSync 'privkey.pem', 'utf8' ,        cert: fs.readFileSync 'newcert.pem', 'utf8'    230  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development      2.   Create an instance of HttpProxy to use with another server var proxy = new httpProxy.HttpProxy {     }  };     target: {        host: 'localhost',        port: 8081    }  } ;      3.   Create https server and start accepting connections. https.createServer options.https,  function    req, res  {     proxy.proxyRequest req, res   } .listen 8443 ;     This may seem like a lot of routing and redirecting, but the Node development group is almost  fanatical about performance, and these components are sufficiently lightweight that they  shouldn’t add much perceptible delay in the processing of requests for your web applications.     Multiplatform Development    One of the great strengths of Node.js is not only its strong support for UNIX and Mac-like  computers, but also its ability to run on Windows machines. As I was writing this book, I  played around with all the samples and ran things on Windows without much trouble at all.     Indeed, you can have people on your projects developing on whatever platforms they want, as  long as you take care to prepare for a couple of minor issues that will crop up: differences in  configurations and path differences.     Locations and Configuration Files    Windows and UNIX-like operating systems naturally keep things in different places. One way  that you can mitigate this problem is to use a configuration file to store these locations. Then  your code can be made flexible enough to know where to find things without having to handle  each platform separately.     You actually first used this technique in  Chapter    8   , “Databases I: NoSQL  MongoDB ,” and  Chapter    9   , “Databases II: SQL  MySQL ,” where you put database configuration information  in a file called local.config.js. You can continue to follow this technique, and expand on that  and generally put any information that affects the running of your application into that file.  Indeed, you don’t need to restrict it to simply file locations or paths, but can configure port  numbers or build types from there as well:      Multiplatform Development  231  exports.config = {     db_config: {        host: "localhost",        user: "root",        password: "",        database: "PhotoAlbums",         pooled_connections: 125,        idle_timeout_millis: 30000    },     static_content: ".. static ",    build_type: "debug"        show extra output  };     What you normally do is actually check this file in to the version control system  such as  GitHub  as local.config.js-base and not have a local.config.js in the source tree. To run the  application, you then copy this base file over to local.config.js, update the values as appropriate  for your local running setup, and then run it that way. Any time you want to use these local  configuration variables, you just add     var local = require 'local.config.js' ;     Then, in code, you’re free to refer to  local.config.variable_xyz   as you need.     Handling Path Differences    The other major difference between Windows and UNIX-like operating systems is paths. How  do you code for things such as  require   when you have handlers in subfolders of your current  project directory and so on?     The good news is that a vast majority of the time, you’ll find that Node accepts the forward  slash        character. When you require modules from relative paths  such as “.. path to sth” , it  just “works” as you would expect it to. Even for cases in which you’re using the fs module APIs,  most of them are also able to handle the differences in path types between the platforms.     For those cases in which you absolutely need to work with the different path styles, you can  use the  path.sep   property in Node.js, and some clever use of array joining and splitting, for  example:     var path = require 'path' ; var comps = [ '..', 'static', 'photos' ]; console.log comps.join path.sep  ;      232  Chapter 10  Deployment and Development  The  process   global in Node.js always tells you what platform you’re running on and can be  queried as follows:     if  process.platform === 'win32'  {     console.log 'Windows' ;  } else {  }        console.log 'You are running on: ' + process.platform ;  Summary    In this chapter, you looked at how to take your Node applications and run them in produc- tion environments, investing execution scripts, load balancing, and multiprocess applications.  This chapter also showed you how to secure your web applications using HTTPS over SSL, and  finally described multiplatform development, showing that it’s not nearly as scary as you  might fear.     You now have a pretty hefty set of tools that enable you to build and run cool asynchronous  applications. In the next chapter, however, you see that using Node.js gets even cooler and  discover that it has a bunch of  synchronous   APIs that lend themselves to doing command-line  programming and scripting.      11  Command-Line  Programming     After spending so much time in this book discussing how Node.js is a powerful asynchro-  nous, nonblocking platform for creating applications, I’m now going to show you how some- times using regular synchronous, blocking IO is also cool in Node—writing command-line  programs. It turns out that writing JavaScript code is so much fun that people are starting to  write a lot of their day-to-day scripts and other quick programs in Node as well.     In this chapter, you look at the basics of running command-line scripts in Node, including  looking at some of the synchronous file system APIs available to you. You then look at how  you can interact with the user directly via buffered and unbuffered input, and finally look at  process creation and execution.     Running Command-Line Scripts    You have quite a few options to run Node.js scripts from the command line, for both UNIX-  and Mac-like operating systems as well as Windows-based ones. You are able to make them  appear as regular operating system commands and pass command-line parameters to them  as well.     UNIX and Mac    On UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or Mac OS X, an overwhelming majority of  users use the Bourne Shell,  sh    or the popular modern variant,  bash  . Although the shell script- ing language it comes with is quite full featured and powerful, it can sometimes still be more  fun to write scripts in JavaScript instead.      234  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  You have two ways to run your Node programs in the shell. The easiest is to just run it as  you always have—by specifying the node program and the script to run  the .js extension is  optional, actually :     node do_something     ! usr local bin node     The second is to directly make the script an executable file by changing the first line as follows:     The first two characters are known as a  shebang , and tell the operating system that what comes  directly after it is the path of the program to execute with this file as a given argument. In the  preceding example, the operating system knows to go to  usr local bin, look for the executable  node, run it, and pass in the file as an argument to Node. The Node interpreter is smart enough  to ignore this first line starting with  !   because it realizes that these are for operating  system use.     So, you can write the following  hello world   executable in Node:     ! usr local bin node console.log "Hello World!" ;     To run the program as an executable, you also need to mark it as an executable file by using  the  chmod   command:     chmod 755 hello_world     Now you can directly execute the script by typing     $  . hello_world Hello World! $     There is one small problem with this approach: What happens when you take your script to  other machines and node is not in  usr local bin, but instead in  usr bin? The common solu- tion is to change the shebang line as follows:     ! usr bin env node     The  env   command then looks through your  PATH   environment variable to find the first  instance of the  node   program and then runs that. All UNIX Mac machines have  env   in  usr  bin, so as long as  node   is in the system  PATH   somewhere, this is more portable.     If you poke around in your various operating system executable directories or other places  where you have installed software, you see that a lot of programs you use on a regular basis are,  in fact, scripts of some sort.     One small bonus: The Node interpreter is smart enough, even on Windows, to ignore the  ! syntax, so you can still write scripts that can be run as executables on both platforms!      Running Command-Line Scripts  235  Windows    Microsoft Windows has never really had a fantastic scripting environment available to it.  Windows Vista and 7 introduced the PowerShell, which is a nice improvement on previous  ones, but it still never quite feels as powerful and easy to use as the shells available on UNIX  platforms. The good news, however, is that this doesn’t hurt you that much because your  primary goal is just to get your scripts launched and executing, and the features available in all  modern  and semimodern  versions of Windows are more than enough.     You can run your scripts with batch files  carrying the extension .bat . If you have the simple  hello_world.js you saw in the previous section, you could create hello_world.bat, as follows:     @echo off node hello_world     By default, Windows echoes every command it sees in a batch file. The  @echo off   tells it to  stop that. Now, to run the program, you could just type     C:\Users\Mark\LearningNode\Chapter11\> hello_world Hello World! C:\Users\Mark\LearningNode\Chapter11\>     But there is a bug in this program! What if hello_world.bat and hello_world.js are in the same  folder, but you are executing the batch file from somewhere else, as shown here:     C:\Users\Mark\LearningNode\Chapter11\>  cd \  C:\>  \Users\Mark\LearningNode\Chapter11\hello_world module.js:340     throw err;          ^  Error: Cannot find module 'C:\hello_world'     at Function.Module._resolveFilename  module.js:338:15     at Function.Module._load  module.js:280:25     at Module.runMain  module.js:492:10     at process.startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback  node.js:244:9      Because you don’t specify the full path to hello_world.js, Node doesn’t know where to look for  it and gets lost. You fix that problem by changing the hello_world.bat script to be as follows:     @echo off node %~d0\%~p0\hello_world     Here, you make use of two handy little batch file macros,  %-pXX   and  %~dXX , to give you the  drive letter and path, respectively, of the  n   th   argument  here, the 0 th , or the name of the script  being run . Now you can run  hello_world   from wherever you want on your computer and  it’ll work properly:     Z:\>  C:\Users\Mark\LearningNode\Chapter11\hello_world Hello World!      236  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  Scripts and Parameters    To be able to do interesting things with your scripts, you need to pass them parameters. In this  case you need to worry about two problems: how to pass these parameters to your scripts and  how to access them within the script.     If you run your Node scripts by calling the interpreter all the time  works on all platforms , you  need to do nothing extra—the arguments are passed directly to the executing script:     node script_name [args]*     Passing Parameters on UNIX Mac    On UNIX-like operating systems where you use the  !   syntax to launch your scripts, these  parameters are passed directly to your scripts when you run them. So, even here, you don’t  have to do anything else.     Passing Parameters on Windows    On Windows, you mostly run your Node scripts via batch files with the .bat extension. You can  pass parameters to these batch files, and they can, in turn, pass them on to your Node.js scripts  by using the macro  %* . So, the batch file would look as follows:     @echo off node %~d0\%~p0\params %*     Accessing Parameters in Node    All parameters passed to your scripts are appended to the  argv   array on the  process   global  object. The first two items in this array are always the  node   interpreter running and the script  being run. So, any additional arguments passed to the script start at the third element, index  2 .  Now run the following:     ! usr local bin node console.log process.argv ;     You should see the output roughly as follows:     Kimidori:01_running marcw$  . params.js  1 2 3 4 5 [ ' usr local bin node',   ' Users marcw src misc LearningNode Chapter11 01_running params.js',  '1',  '2',  '3',  '4',  '5' ]      Working with Files Synchronously  237  Working with Files Synchronously    For nearly every single API you have seen in the file system module   fs  , both asynchronous  and synchronous versions are available. You have mostly been using the asynchronous versions  thus far, but the synchronous versions can be extremely useful to you when writing command- line programs. Basically, for a vast majority of APIs in  fs   with the name  func , there is a corre- sponding API called  funcSync .     In the following sections, you look at a few examples of how you can use some of these  synchronous APIs.     Basic File APIs    The  fs   module doesn’t have a file copy function, so you can write one yourself. For the  open ,  read , and  write   APIs, you use the synchronous versions:  openSync ,  readSync , and   writeSync . In the synchronous versions, they throw an error if anything goes wrong. You can  use a buffer to hold the data as you copy from location  a   to  b.   Be sure to close everything when  you’re done:     var BUFFER_SIZE = 1000000;  function  copy_file_sync    src, dest  {     var read_so_far, fdsrc, fddest, read;    var buff = new Buffer BUFFER_SIZE ;     fdsrc = fs.openSync src, 'r' ;    fddest = fs.openSync dest, 'w' ;    read_so_far = 0;     do {        read = fs.readSync fdsrc, buff, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, read_so_far ;        fs.writeSync fddest, buff, 0, read ;        read_so_far += read;    } while  read > 0 ;     fs.closeSync fdsrc ;    return fs.closeSync fddest ;  }     To call this function, you can write a file_copy.js script that makes sure it gets enough argu- ments, calls the copy function, and then handles any errors that are thrown during the process:     if  process.argv.length != 4  {     console.log "Usage: " + path.basename process.argv[1], '.js'                 + " [src_file] [dest_file]" ;   238  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  } else {     try {        copy_file_sync process.argv[2], process.argv[3] ;    } catch  e  {        console.log "Error copying file:" ;        console.log e ;        process.exit -1 ;    }     console.log "1 file copied." ;  }     You can see here that you also make use of a new function,  process.exit . This function  terminates the Node.js program immediately and passes the return code back to the calling  program  often a shell interpreter or command prompt . The standard in Bourne shell   sh   or  bash   is to return  0   on success and nonzero when something bad happens. You return – 1   when  something goes wrong with the copy.     You can trivially change this copy function to a move function by first performing the file copy  operation and then deleting the source file when you’re sure the destination has been fully  written and successfully closed. You perform this deletion by using the function  unlinkSync:     function  move_file_sync    src, dest  {     var read_so_far, fdsrc, fddest, read;    var buff = new Buffer BUFFER_SIZE ;     fdsrc = fs.openSync src, 'r' ;    fddest = fs.openSync dest, 'w' ;    read_so_far = 0;     do {        read = fs.readSync fdsrc, buff, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, read_so_far ;        fs.writeSync fddest, buff, 0, read ;        read_so_far += read;    } while  read > 0 ;     fs.closeSync fdsrc ;    fs.closeSync fddest ;    return  fs.unlinkSync src  ;  }     The rest of the script remains the same, except you change the call to  copy_file_sync   to  move_file_sync .      Working with Files Synchronously  239  Files and Stats    You create folders in Node by using the  mkdir   function in the file system module. In the  scripts shown here, you use the  mkdirSync   variation of it. Now you’re ready to write a program  that behaves the same as the  mkdir -p   command in UNIX shells: You specify a full path, and  it creates that directory and also any missing intermediary directories that do not yet exist.     The work takes place in two steps:       1.     You break apart the path and then, starting at the top, see which directories exist already  or not. If something exists at the given location but isn’t a directory  that is, you want  to use  mkdir a b c , but a b already exists and is a regular file , you throw an error. To  determine the existence of a file, you use the  existsSync   function and then call the  statsSync   function, which gives you a  Stats   object that can tell you whether or not  the object there is a directory.       2.     For all those entries that have not yet been created, you iterate through and create them.     Here’s the code for the  mkdirs   function:     function  mkdirs    path_to_create, mode  {     if  mode == undefined  mode = 0777 &  ~process.umask   ;         1.   What do we have already or not?    var parts = path_to_create.split path.sep ;    var i;    for  i = 0; i < parts.length; i++  {        var search;        search = parts.slice 0, i + 1 .join path.sep ;        if  fs.existsSync search   {            var st;            if   st = fs.statSync search    {                if  !st.isDirectory                       throw new Error "Intermediate exists, is not a dir!" ;            }        } else {               doesn't exist. We can start creating now            break;        }    }         2.   Create whatever we don't have yet.    for  var j = i; j < parts.length; j++  {        var build = parts.slice 0,   j + 1 .join path.sep ;        fs.mkdirSync build, mode ;    }  }      240  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  The first line of this function, to set up the mask, is just a way for you to choose reasonable  permissions for the new directories. The caller of this function can specify them directly, or he  can use what is known as the  umask   to filter out those permissions that the current shell user  does not want to give to new files  or directories . On Windows machines,  umask   returns  0 ,  indicating that it does not want to mask anything out at all; Windows uses a completely differ- ent mechanism for file permissions.     Listing Contents of Directories    To list the contents of a directory, you can use the  readdirSync   function, which returns an  array of all filenames in the specified folder, excluding  "."   and  ".." :     ! usr local bin node var fs = require 'fs' ;  var files = fs.readdirSync "." ; console.log files ;     Interacting with the User: stdin stdout    You might be familiar with the trio of IO handles given to all processes,  stdin ,  stdout , and  stderr , representing input, normal output, and error output, respectively. These are all avail- able to the Node.js scripts and hang off the  process   object. In Node, they are all instances of  Stream   objects  see  Chapter    6   , “Expanding Your Web Server” .     The  console.log   function, in fact, is just the equivalent of     process.stdout.write text + "\n" ;     Whereas  console.error   is basically     process.stderr.write text + "\n" ;     Input, however, gives you a few more options, so in the following sections, you look at buff- ered  line-by-line  input versus unbuffered  type a character and immediately see something   input.     Basic Buffered Input-Output    By default, the stream you get for  stdin   reads and buffers one line at a time. Thus, if you try to  read from  stdin , nothing happens until the user presses the Enter key, and then your program  is given the entire line read from the input stream. You listen for these events by adding a  handler for the  readable   event on  stdin , as follows:     process.stdin.on  'readable' ,  function      {     var data = process.stdin.read  ;       do something w input  } ;      Interacting with the User: stdin stdout  241  By default, however, the  stdin   stream is paused. Before you can start receiving anything from  it, you need to call the  resume   function:     process.stdin.resume  ;     Write a little program that reads in a line of input and then generates and prints out an  md5 hash of this input, looping until the user either presses Ctrl+C or enters a blank line:     process.stdout.write "Hash-o-tron 3000\n" ; process.stdout.write " Ctrl+C or Empty line quits \n" ; process.stdout.write "data to hash > " ;  process.stdin.on  'readable' ,  function      {     var data = process.stdin.read  ;    if  data == null  return;    if  data == "\n"  process.exit 0 ;     var hash = require 'crypto' .createHash 'md5' ;    hash.update data ;    process.stdout.write "Hashed to: " + hash.digest 'hex'  + "\n" ;    process.stdout.write "data to hash > " ;  } ;  process.stdin.setEncoding 'utf8' ; process.stdin.resume  ;     Most of the work happens when the user presses Enter: You check to see whether the input is  nonempty. If it is, you hash it, print out the result, and then print another prompt and wait for  the user to type in something else. Because  stdin   is not in the paused state, the Node program  does not exit.  If you were to pause it, it would exit if there was nothing else to do.      Unbuffered Input    For those situations in which you want to let the user simply press a key and have something  happen immediately, you can turn on  raw mode   on the  stdin   stream, using the  setRawMode function, which takes a Boolean indicating whether or not it should turn on   true   raw mode.     Update your hash generator for the previous section to let the user select which type of hash  she would like. After the user enters a line of text and presses Enter, you ask her to press a  number between  1   and  4   to choose which algorithm she’d like. The complete listing for this  program is shown in  Listing    11.1   .     Listing 11.1      Using RawMode on stdin  raw_mode.js      process.stdout.write "Hash-o-tron 3000\n" ; process.stdout.write " Ctrl+C or Empty line quits \n" ; process.stdout.write "data to hash > " ;   242  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  process.stdin.on 'readable'  ,  function    data  {     var data = process.stdin.read  ;    if  !process.stdin.isRaw  {                              1.         if  data == "\n"  process.exit 0 ;        process.stdout.write "Please select type of hash:\n" ;        process.stdout.write " 1 – md5, 2 – sha1, 3 – sha256, 4 – sha512  \n" ;        process.stdout.write "[1-4] > " ;        process.stdin.setRawMode true ;    } else {        var alg;        if  data != ' ^C '  {                                   2.             var c = parseInt data ;            switch  c  {                case 1: alg = 'md5'; break;                case 2: alg = 'sha1'; break;                case 3: alg = 'sha256'; break;                case 4: alg = 'sha512'; break;            }            if  alg  {                                       3.                 var hash =   require 'crypto' .createHash alg ;                hash.update data ;                process.stdout.write "\nHashed to: " + hash.digest 'hex'  ;                process.stdout.write "\ndata to hash > " ;                process.stdin.setRawMode false ;            } else {                process.stdout.write "\nPlease select type of hash:\n" ;                process.stdout.write "[1-4] > " ;            }        } else {            process.stdout.write "\ndata to hash > " ;            process.stdin.setRawMode false ;        }    }  } ;  process.stdin.setEncoding 'utf8'  process.stdin.resume  ;     Because this script receives input from  stdin   both when it is buffered  you’re asking for the  text to hash  and when it is unbuffered  when you ask for the hashing algorithm to use , it’s a  bit more involved. Let’s see how it works:       1.     You first check to see whether the input you received is buffered or unbuffered. If the  former, it’s a line of text to hash, and you should print out the request to choose which  algorithm to use. Because you want the user to just be able to press a number between  1      Interacting with the User: stdin stdout  243  and  4 , you switch  stdin   to  RawMode   now so that pressing any key triggers the  readable    event.       2.     If the stream is in  RawMode , it means the user has pressed a key in response to your  request for a hash algorithm. For the first line here, you check to see whether this key is  Ctrl+C.  Note that this can be tricky to enter into a text editor; in Emacs, you can press  Ctrl+Q and then Ctrl+C, and it types the  ^C   for you. Every editor is slightly different.  If  the user pressed Ctrl+C, you abort the input request and go back to the hash prompt.     If the user entered some other key, you first make sure it’s a valid key   1–4   or else you  squawk and make him try again.       3.     Finally, depending on the algorithm selected, you generate the hash, print it out, and  then go back to the normal enter data prompt. You must be sure to turn off  RawMode here so that you go back to line-buffered input!     Again, because you call  resume   on  stdin   in this program, it does not exit until you call  process.exit , the user enters a blank line, or the user presses Ctrl+C during buffered input   which causes Node to just terminate .     The Readline Module    One other way to work with input in Node.js is to use the  readline   module. It’s still marked as  Unstable   and subject to change, so I don’t devote too much time and energy to it here, but it  does have a couple neat features that you can use in your programs.     To turn on the readline module, call the  createInterface   method on it, specifying as options  the  stdin   and  stdout   streams to use:     var readline = require 'readline' ;  var rl = readline.createInterface {     input: process.stdin,    output: process.stdout  } ;     After you do this, your program does not exit until  rl.close   is called!     Line-by-Line Prompting    If you call the  prompt   method in readline, the program waits for a line of input  followed by  Enter . When the program gets this keypress, it sends the  line   event on the  readline   object.  The event can process it as needed:     rl.on "line", function  line  {     console.log line ;    rl.prompt  ;  } ;      244  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  To continue listening, you call the  prompt   method again. One of the nice things about the  readline interface is that if the user presses Ctrl+C, you get the  SIGINT   event called, and you  can either shut things down there or do other things to reset the state and continue. Here, by  closing the readline interface, you cause the program to stop listening for input and exit:     rl.on "SIGINT",  function      {     rl.close  ;  } ;     Now you’re ready to write a little Reverse Polish Notation calculator using the readline module.  The code for this calculator is shown in  Listing    11.2   .     If you’ve never heard of Reverse Polish Notation or forgotten how it works, it’s basically a post- fix mathematical notation format. Instead of writing  1 + 2 , you write  1 2 + . To write  5 *  2 + 3  ,  you write:  5 2 3 + * , and so on. The little calculator takes a string at a time, splits it up based on  spaces, and does simple calculations.     Listing 11.2      Simple Postfix Calculator Using readline  readline.js      var readline = require 'readline' ; var rl = readline.createInterface {     input: process.stdin,    output: process.stdout  } ;  var p = "postfix expression > " rl.setPrompt p, p.length ; rl.prompt  ;                                                1.   rl.on "line",  function    line  {                             2.      if  line == "\n"   {        rl.close  ; return;    }     var parts = line.split new RegExp "[ ]+"  ;    var r = postfix_process parts ;    if  r !== false         process.stdout.write "Result: " + r + "\n" ;    else        process.stdout.write "Invalid expression.\n" ;    rl.prompt  ;                                            3.  rl.on "SIGINT",  function      {                               4.   } ;  } ;     rl.close  ;   Interacting with the User: stdin stdout  245     push numbers onto a stack, pop when we see an operator. function  postfix_process  parts  {     var stack = [];    for  var i = 0; i < parts.length; i++  {        switch  parts[i]  {          case  '+' : case  '-' : case  '*' : case    ' ' :            if  stack.length < 2  return false;            do_op stack, parts[i] ;            break;          default:            var num = parseFloat parts[i] ;            if  isNaN num   return false;            stack.push num ;            break;        }    }    if  stack.length != 1  return false;    return stack.pop  ;  function  do_op  stack, operator  {     var b = stack.pop  ;    var a = stack.pop  ;    switch  operator  {      case  '+' : stack.push a + b ; break;      case  '-' : stack.push a - b ; break;      case  '*' : stack.push a * b ; break;      case  ' ' : stack.push a   b ; break;      default:  throw new Error "Unexpected operator" ;    }  }  }       1.    2.  This program works as follows:        You create the readline module object, set the default prompt text on it, and then tell  readline to show that prompt and wait for a line of input.        When you receive a line of input, you check to see whether it’s empty  in which case you  close down the program by closing the readline interface , or else you parse the input  string and pass it to the little calculating function. You print out the results  good  or bad .       3.     You complete the loop by telling readline to print out the prompt and wait again.       4.     If the user presses Ctrl+C, you close down the readline, which causes the program to exit  gracefully.      246  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  Now you can test it:     Kimidori:03_stdinout marcw$  node readline_rpn.js postfix expression >  1 2 +  Result: 3  postfix expression >  2 3 4 + *  Result: 14  postfix expression >  cat  Invalid expression.  postfix expression >  1 2 4 cat dog  3 4 + -   * Invalid expression.  postfix expression >  2 3 + 5 *  Result: 25  postfix expression >     Questions    The other major functionality in the readline module is the ability to ask questions and receive  the answers directly in a callback. The basic format is     rl.question "hello? ",  function    answer  {        do something  } ;     Next, you write a little program that performs a survey: It takes an array of questions  which  you could put in a file if you wanted to make it configurable  and asks them one at a time  to the user. It then writes the user’s answers to answers.txt using  appendFileSync   on the fs  module.     Note that because the question function is asynchronous, you have to use  async.forEachSeries   to iterate over each of the questions in the survey! The code for  the survey program is shown in  Listing    11.3   .     Listing 11.3      Survey Program  questions.js      var readline = require 'readline' ,     async = require "async" ,    fs = require 'fs' ;  var questions = [ "What's your favorite color? ",                   "What's your shoe size? ",                  "Cats or dogs? ",                  "Doctor Who or Doctor House? " ];  var rl = readline.createInterface {                        1.      input: process.stdin,    output: process.stdout  } ;   Working with Processes  247  var output = []; async.forEachSeries      questions,     function    item, cb  {                                  2.         rl.question item, function  answer  {            output.push answer ;            cb null ;        } ;    },     function    err  {                                       3.         if  err  {            console.log "Hunh, couldn't get answers" ;            console.log err ;            return;        }        fs.appendFileSync "answers.txt", JSON.stringify output  + "\n" ;        console.log "\nThanks for your answers!" ;        console.log "We'll sell them to some telemarketer immediately!" ;        rl.close  ;    }   ;       2.    3.  The program performs the following tasks:       1.     It initializes the readline module and sets up the  stdin   and  stdout   streams.        Then, for each question in the array, you call the question function on readline  using  async.forEachSeries   because question is an asynchronous function  and add the  result to the output array.        Finally, after all the questions have been asked and  async   calls the results function, you  either print the error if there was one or append the user’s output to the answers.txt file  and then close the  readline   object to exit the program.     Working with Processes    One other thing you can do from the command line  or even from within your web applica- tions  in Node is to launch other programs. You have a couple of options for this using the  child_process   module, with varying degrees of complexity. In the following sections, you start  with the easier option,  exec .     Simple Process Creation    The  exec   function in the child_process module takes a command and executes it in the system  shell   sh   bash   on UNIX Mac, or  cmd.exe   on Windows . Thus, you can specify something    248  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  simple like  "date"   as the program to run, or something complicated like  "echo 'Mancy'   sed s M N g" . All commands are run, and all output is buffered and passed back to the caller  after the command finishes.     The basic format is     exec command, function  error, stdout, stderr  {        error is if an error occurred       stdout and stderr are buffers  } ;     After the command finishes executing, the callback is called. The first parameter is non-null  only if an error occurred. Otherwise,  stdout   and  stderr   are set to  Buffer   objects with the full  contents of anything written to the respective output stream.     Now write a program that uses the  exec   function to run the  cat   program   type   on Windows .  It takes the name of a file to print out. It uses the  exec   function to launch the  cat   type program and then prints out all the output when you’re done:     var exec = require 'child_process' .exec,     child;  if  process.argv.length != 3  {     console.log "I need a file name" ;    process.exit -1 ;  }  var file_name = process.argv[2]; var cmd = process.platform == 'win32' ? 'type' : "cat"; child = exec cmd + " " + file_name,  function    error, stdout, stderr  {     console.log 'stdout: ' + stdout ;    console.log 'stderr: ' + stderr ;     if  error  {        console.log "Error exec'ing the file" ;        console.log error ;        process.exit 1 ;    } } ;     Advanced Process Creation with Spawn    A more advanced way of creating processes is to use the  spawn   function available in the  child_process module. This function gives you complete control over the  stdin   and  stdout   of  the child processes you create, and permits some fantastic functionality, such as piping output  from one child to another.      Start by writing a program that takes the name of a JavaScript file and runs it with the  node    program:     Working with Processes  249  var spawn = require "child_process" .spawn; var node;  if  process.argv.length != 3  {     console.log "I need a script to run" ;    process.exit -1 ;  }  }     var node = spawn "node", [ process.argv[2] ] ; node.stdout.on 'readable', print_stdout ; node.stderr.on 'readable', print_stderr ; node.on 'exit', exited ;  function print_stdout   {     var data = process.stdout.read  ;    console.log "stdout: " + data.toString 'utf8'  ;  } function print_stderr data  {     var data = process.stderr.read  ;    console.log "stderr: " + data.toString 'utf8'  ;  } function exited code  {     console.error "--> Node exited with code: " + code ;  When you want to call  spawn , the first argument is the name of the command to execute,  and the second is an array of parameters to pass to it. You can see that any output written  to  stdout   or  stderr   on the child process immediately triggers an event on the appropriate  stream, and you can see what’s happening right away.     Now you’re ready to write something a bit more advanced. In the preceding chapter, you saw a  way to effectively do the following in shell scripts or command prompts:     while 1  end        node script_name  Write that same code, but in JavaScript, using the  spawn   function. Using this function is actu- ally a bit more work than writing it in the shells, but it’s instructive and sets you up to do  more work and monitoring as you want later. The code for the new launcher is shown in  Listing    11.4   .      250  Chapter 11  Command-Line Programming  Listing 11.4      An All-Node Node Runner  node_runner.js      var spawn = require "child_process" .spawn; var node;  if  process.argv.length < 3  {     console.log "I need a script to run" ;    process.exit -1 ;  function  spawn_node    {     var node = spawn "node", process.argv.slice 2  ;       node.stdout.on 'readable' , print_stdout ;       node.stderr.on 'readable'  , print_stderr ;      node.on 'exit'  , exited ;  function  print_stdout    {     var data = process.stdout.read  ;    console.log "stdout: " + data.toString 'utf8'  ;  } function  print_stderr  data  {     var data = process.stderr.read  ;    console.log "stderr: " + data.toString 'utf8'  ;  } function  exited  code  {  }  }  }  spawn_node  ;        console.error "--> Node exited with code: " + code + ". Restarting" ;    spawn_node  ;  This program works by listening for the  exit   event on the spawned process. Whenever it sees  that, it restarts the  node   interpreter with the script you want to run.     I leave it to you as an exercise to update this script to behave like the full node_ninja_runner  you wrote in the preceding chapter. You can get the output of the  ps aux   command by using  the  exec   function; the resulting buffer can easily be parsed in JavaScript. Finally, you can kill a  child process by calling the  kill   method on it if you detect that it’s getting too large.      Summary  251  Summary    Now you’ve seen that Node is not only great for writing networked applications, but is also  extremely powerful and fun for command-line synchronous applications. After this tour  of creating and running scripts and passing parameters to them, you should now be pretty  comfortable manipulating input and output in your program, and even be able to switch  between buffered and unbuffered input when necessary. Finally, you should be able to create  and run programs in your Node.js scripts with  exec   and  spawn .     To finish this treatment of programming JavaScript in Node.js, it’s time now to turn your atten- tion to testing your scripts and applications.      This page intentionally left blank    12  Testing     With all the code you have written so far, you’re now ready to look at how to test it to make   sure it works. There are many models and paradigms through which this is done, and Node.js  supports most of them. This chapter looks at some of the more common ones and then looks  at how you can do functional testing of not only synchronous APIs, but also Node’s asynchro- nous code, and then add some testing to your photo album application.     Choosing a Framework    A few common models of testing are available, including  test-driven development    TDD  and  behavior-driven development    BDD . The former focuses highly on making sure that all your code  is properly exposed to testing  indeed, in many cases, demanding that you write no code until  you’ve written the tests for it , whereas the latter focuses more on the business requirements  of a particular unit or module of code, and encourages testing to be a bit more holistic than  simple unit testing.     Regardless of which model to which you subscribe  or will subscribe, if this is your first time  writing tests , adding tests to your code base is always a good idea because you not only want  to make sure that what you have written works, but also make sure that future changes you  make to your code-base don’t break things. Adding testing to your Node applications adds a  few challenges because you frequently need to mix synchronous, asynchronous, and RESTful  server API functionality together, but the Node.js platform is sufficiently robust and advanced  already that there are options for all your   needs.     Of the many frameworks available today, three stand out in popularity:              nodeunit —This is a simple and straightforward test-runner for testing both in Node   and in the browser. It’s extremely easy to work with and gives you a lot of flexibility for  setting up your testing framework.        Mocha —Based on an older testing framework called Expresso, Mocha is basically a more   feature-rich TDD framework for Node that focuses on being easier to use and more  enjoyable to code. It has some cool features for asynchronous testing and an API for  output formatting.      254  Chapter 12  Testing        VowsJS —The most prominent of the BDD testing frameworks for Node.js, VowsJS not  only has a very descriptive syntax and structure to combine BDD ideas with your tests,  but also runs your tests concurrently, for faster execution.     Although they all work perfectly fine and have their places, for this chapter, you can stick  with the reasonably straightforward  nodeunit , largely because it’s really easy to work with and  demonstrate.     Installing  Nodeunit    For your projects now, you can create a test  subfolder into which you put all the files, samples,  and data files related to the testing of your various projects. The first file to put in is package. json, as follows:     {   "name": "API-testing-demo",  "description": "Demonstrates API Testing with nodeunit",  "version": "0.0.1",  "private": true,  "dependencies": {     "nodeunit": "0.7.x"   } }     When you run  npm update ,  nodeunit   is installed, and you can begin writing and running tests.     Writing Tests    Nodeunit   organizes tests into modules, with each exposed function acting as a test, and each  exposed object acting as a group of tests. To each test, you are given an object that will help  you perform the tests and tell  nodeunit   when you are done:     exports.test1 = function  test  {     test.equals true, true ;    test.done  ;  }     You must call  test.done   at the end of every single test; otherwise,  nodeunit   does not know  when it is finished. To run this test, save it to a file called trivial.js and then run the provided  running script in the node_modules .bin folder. On both Unix Mac platforms and Windows,  you run  switch the      characters for  \   characters on Windows, of course      node_modules .bin nodeunit trivial.js      Writing Tests  255  You see something similar to     C:\Users\Mark\a>  node_modules\.bin\nodeunit.cmd trivial.js   trivial.js ✓ test1  OK: 1 assertions  0ms   C:\Users\Mark\a>     Simple Functional Tests    For each test you write, you want to do three things:       1.    2.     Call the  expect   method on the provided test parameter with the number of “conditions”  nodeunit   should expect you to verify in this particular test. This step is optional, but  completing it is a good idea in case some of the code accidentally skips over a test.        For each condition you want to verify, you should call some sort of assertion function   see  Table    12.1     to verify you’re seeing what you expect to see.  test.equals   is the first  example you’ve seen of this.       3.     Call  test.done   at the end of every single test to tell  nodeunit   you are finished.     Now take the code you wrote for a Reverse Polish Notation calculator in the preceding chapter  and put it in a file called rpn.js  see  Listing    12.1    .     Listing 12.1      The rpn.js File        push numbers onto a stack, pop when we see an operator. exports.version = "1.0.0";  exports. compute   = function  parts  {     var stack = [];    for  var i = 0; i < parts.length; i++  {        switch  parts[i]  {          case '+': case '-': case '*': case ' ':            if  stack.length < 2  return false;            do_op stack, parts[i] ;            break;        default:            var num = parseFloat parts[i] ;            if  isNaN num   return false;            stack.push num ;            break;        }    }   256  Chapter 12  Testing     if  stack.length != 1  return false;    return stack.pop  ;  function  do_op  stack, operator  {     var b = stack.pop  ;    var a = stack.pop  ;    switch  operator  {      case '+': stack.push a + b ; break;      case '-': stack.push a - b ; break;      case '*':   stack.push a * b ; break;      case ' ': stack.push a   b ; break;      default:  throw new Error "Unexpected operator" ;    }  Now, write some tests for it  don’t forget to use  require   in the rpn.js file in your test file :     exports. addition   = function  test  {     test.expect 4 ;    test.equals rpn.compute prep "1 2 +"  , 3 ;    test.equals rpn.compute prep "1 2 3 + +"  , 6 ;    test.equals rpn.compute prep "1 2 + 5 6 + +"  , 14 ;    test.equals rpn.compute prep "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 + + + + + +"  , 28 ;    test.done  ;  The prep function just splits the provided string into an array:     function prep str  {     return str.trim  .split  [ ]+  ;  You can repeat this for all the operators your calculator supports  subtraction, multiplication,  and division , and even write some additional ones for decimal numbers:     exports. decimals   = function  test  {     test.expect 2 ;    test.equals rpn.compute prep "3.14159 5 *"  , 15.70795 ;    test.equals rpn.compute prep "100 3  "  , 33.333333333333336 ;    test.done  ;  So far you’ve only used the  test.equals   assertion to verify that values are what you expect.  Nodeunit   uses a module from  npm   called  assert , however, and there are many other possibilities,  as shown in  Table    12.1   .     }  }     };     }     }      Writing Tests  257  Tests     Tests whether or not  value   is true.     Tests whether  value   is expected  shallow test with  == ,  not  ===  .      Makes sure that  value   is not the same as expected   shallow, using  ==   only .      Makes sure that  value   is expected, inspecting sub- values if required, using  == .      Makes sure that  value   is not expected, inspecting sub- values if required, using  == .     Makes sure that the given code block throws an error.  You can optionally tell it what kind of error you’re expect- ing.      Makes sure the given code does not throw an error   optionally, of the specified type .     Table 12.1      Testing Assertions     Method     ok value      equal value, expected      notEqual value, expected   deepEqual value, expected   notDeepEqual value, expected   doesNotThrow value, expected   exports. empty   = function  test  {     test.expect 1 ;    test.throws rpn.compute []  ;    test.done  ;  };     strictEqual value, expected    Tests for equality, using the  ===   operator.     throws code, [Error]      So, you can now add a new test to make sure that the calculator rejects empty expressions:     When the tests fail,  nodeunit   tells you loudly, giving you both the condition that failed and a  full stack of calls that led up to that failure:     01_functional.js  cid:180  addition  AssertionError: 28 == 27  ✓ subtraction ✓ multiplication ✓ division     at Object.assertWrapper [as equals]          [...]tests node_modules nodeunit lib types.js:83:39      at Object.exports.addition [...]tests  01_functional.js:9:10      etc    258  Chapter 12  Testing  ✓ decimals ✓ empty  FAILURES: 1 17 assertions failed  5ms      You can then look in your code to see which test is causing the problem and analyze the  problem or regression.     Testing Asynchronous Functionality    Because you do much asynchronous programming in Node.js, many of the tests are also asyn- chronous.  Nodeunit   is designed with this in mind: Your tests can take as long as they want and  be as asynchronous as they want, as long as they call  test.done   when they’re finished execut- ing. As an example, write a couple of asynchronous tests right now:     exports.async1 = function  test  {     setTimeout function    {        test.equal false, true ;        test.done  ;    }, 2000 ;  exports.async2 = function  test  {     setTimeout function    {        test.equal true, true ;        test.done  ;    }, 1400 ;  };  };     02_async.js ✓ async1 ✓ async2  OK: 2 assertions  3406ms      Running this test module provides the following output  note that the runtime is roughly the  combination of the two tests run serially :     Kimidori: functional_tests marcw$ node_modules .bin nodeunit 02_async.js  RESTful API Testing    Now you can add tests for your photo album at two levels: one to functionally test that various  modules you’ve written are working properly and another to test that the server itself is main- taining a consistent and functional REST API.      RESTful API Testing  259  You can still use  nodeunit   for the latter by adding a single  npm   module called  request , which  allows you to call remote URLs using the various HTTP methods and returns the results back to  you in the form of a  Buffer   object.     For example, to call  v1 albums.json on your server, you can call     request.get "http:  localhost:8080 v1 albums.json", function  err, resp, body  {     var r = JSON.parse body ;       do something  } ;     The callback function is given        An error for those cases when something catastrophic goes wrong.        An  HttpResponse   object where you can check things such as headers and status codes.        A  Buffer   object holding the contents of the body of the response  if there was one    returned by the server.     Take the MySQL version of the photo album application you wrote in  Chapter    9   , “Databases II:  SQL  MySQL ,” and copy it to somewhere new. Then scrub the database and rerun the database  initialization script, schema.sql:     mysql -u root < schema.sql     And then in the root folder, create a new directory called test :              {  + photo_album    + static   + app   + test      In this test folder, copy over a package.json that has both  nodeunit   and  request :      "name": "API-testing-demo",  "description": "Demonstrates API Testing with request and nodeunit",  "version": "0.0.1",  "private": true,  "dependencies": {     "nodeunit": "0.7.x",      "request": "2.x"   } }     And now you can write your first test:     var request = require 'request' ;  var h = "http:  localhost:8080"; exports. no_albums   = function  test  {   260  Chapter 12  Testing     test.expect 5 ;    request.get h + " v1 albums.json",  function    err, resp, body  {        test.equal err, null ;        test.equal resp.statusCode, 200 ;        var r = JSON.parse body ;        test.equal r.error, null ;        test.notEqual r.data.albums, undefined ;        test.equal r.data.albums.length, 0 ;        test.done  ;    } ;  };     At the beginning, there are no albums in the database, so you should get an empty array back  when requesting all albums.     To test album creation, you need to use the PUT method to send the data to the server and  then test the response you get back. The  request   module lets you specify JSON to pass to the  server along with the request, automagically specifies the  Content-Type: application json header for you, and expects JSON in return:     exports. create_album   = function  test  {     var d = "We went to HK to do some shopping and spend New Year's. Nice!";    var t = "New Year's in Hong Kong";    test.expect 7 ;    request.put         { url: h + " v1 albums.json",          json: { name: "hongkong2012",                  title: t,                  description: d,                  date: "2012-12-28" } },         function    err, resp, body  {            test.equal err, null ;            test.equal resp.statusCode, 200 ;            test.notEqual body.data.album, undefined ;            test.equal body.data.album.name, "hongkong2012" ,            test.equal body.data.album.date, "2012-12-28" ;            test.equal body.data.album.description, d ;            test.equal body.data.album.title, t ;            test.done  ;        }     ;  };     When the request is completed, you can test all sorts of things, including the HTTP response  code  which should be 200 for successful requests of this type , and you can pick apart the  JSON and make sure it’s similar to what you expected it to be. At the beginning, observe that  the code specifies that you will check seven conditions; this helps  nodeunit   sanity check for you.      RESTful API Testing  261  Finally, you should not only make sure that the API works as expected, but also  doesn’t   work as  expected! If a function is expected to return an error, then test that! Indeed, while I was writing  this book, the following test discovered that the album handler in handlers albums.js had some  parameter validation bugs:     exports. fail_create_album   = function  test  {     test.expect 4 ;    request.put         { url: h + " v1 albums.json",          headers: { "Content-Type" : "application json" },          json: { name: "Hong kKong 2012",                      no spaces allowed!                         title: "title",                         description: "desc",                  date: "2012-12-28" } },         function    err, resp, body  {            test.equal err, null ;            test.equal resp.statusCode, 403 ;            test.notEqual body.error, null ;            test.equal body.error, "invalid_album_name" ;            test.done  ;        }     ;  };     You not only test that the HTTP status code is the expected 403, but that the error code is what  you would expect as well.     Testing Secured Resources    You’ve secured some parts of your server with a username and password  and then put the  traffic for them behind HTTPS so nobody can see them . To test this, you can take advantage  of the fact that HTTP Basic Authentication can be built right into URLs you give to  request , as  follows:     https:  localhost: username@password :8080 v1 albums.json     Thus, to test secure parts of the site, you can write the  nodeunit   tests as follows:     var h = "localhost:username@secret:8080"; exports. get_user_info   = function  test  {     test.expect 5 ;    request.get h + " v1 users marcwan.json",  function    err, resp, body  {        test.equal err, null ;        test.notEqual resp.statusCode, 401 ;        test.equal resp.statusCode, 200 ;        var r = JSON.parse body ;        test.equal r.data.user.username, "marcwan" ;   262  Chapter 12  Testing         test.equal r.data.user.password, undefined ;        test.done  ;    } ;  };     Summary    Testing your Node.js apps and scripts is both simple and fast with many of the available testing  frameworks available via  npm . In this chapter, I showed you not only how to use  nodeunit , a  popular TDD framework, to test the synchronous and asynchronous portions of your applica- tions, but also how to combine it with  request   to perform full API-level testing of your JSON  servers.     With this knowledge tucked under your belt, you’ve come to the end of your tour of Node.js.  I hope that I’ve been able to convey some of the reasons why Node.js is so unbelievably excit- ing and fun to develop with and encouraged you to type things and play with the platform as  you’ve been reading along.     Sit down and start to write some code. If you have an idea for a website, start putting together  some pages and APIs for it. If you do mobile development, think about the ways in which you  can deliver a server to mobile customers, and figure out how to use Node to do that. Even if  you’re just looking to script some things on a server, play around and start writing code today.  The only way to get better at programming on any platform is to just use it.     If you run into problems, don’t forget that the Node.js community is extremely active and  helpful. With so many helpful and motivated members, it’s certain you’ll be able to meet many  like-minded users and get all the resources and help you need to build interesting, useful, and  fun applications.
