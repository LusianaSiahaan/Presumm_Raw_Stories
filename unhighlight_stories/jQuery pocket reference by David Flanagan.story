It is one chapter from my much longer book JavaScript: The Definitive Guide. jQuery is such a powerful library and so well suited to pocket reference format that it seemed worth publishing this material on its own.  This  book  assumes  that  you  already  know  how  to  program with JavaScript, and that you are familiar with the basics of client-side  JavaScript  programming  without  jQuery.  For  ex- ample, you should know about DOM methods like getElement ById  , getElementsByTagName  , and addEventListener  . Thanks to Raffaele Cecco for a timely and thorough review of the book and of the code it contains. Thanks also to John Resig and the entire jQuery team for creating such a useful library, to my editor Mike Loukides for his enthusiasm for this project, and  to  the  O’Reilly  production  department  for  getting  this book out so quickly.

The arrival of IE9 eliminates the worst of those incompatibilities, but many programmers find it easier to write web applications using a JavaScript framework or utility library to simplify common tasks and hide the differ- ences between browsers. At the time of this writing, jQuery is one of the most popular and widely used of these libraries.  Because it has become so widely used, web developers should be familiar with the jQuery library: even if you don’t use it in your own code, you are likely to encounter it in code written by others. Fortunately, jQuery is stable and small enough to document in pocket reference form.  jQuery makes it easy to find the elements of a document, and then  manipulate  those  elements  by  adding  content,  editing HTML attributes and CSS properties, defining event handlers, and performing animations. It also has Ajax utilities for dy- namically making HTTP requests, and general-purpose utility functions for working with objects and arrays.  As its name implies, the jQuery library is focused on queries. A typical query uses a CSS selector to identify a set of document elements and then returns an object that represents those ele- ments. This returned object provides many useful methods for  1   operating  on  the  matching  elements  as  a  group.  Whenever possible, these methods return the object on which they are invoked,  allowing  a  succinct  method-chaining  idiom  to  be used. These features are at the heart of jQuery’s power and utility:    An  expressive  syntax   CSS  selectors   for  referring  to  elements in the document    An efficient query method for finding the set of document  elements that match a CSS selector    A  useful  set  of  methods  for  manipulating  selected  elements    Powerful functional programming techniques for operat- ing on sets of elements as a group, rather than one at a time   A  succinct  idiom   method  chaining   for  expressing  sequences of operations  This book begins with an introduction to jQuery that shows how to make simple queries and work with the results. The chapters that follow explain:    How  to  set  HTML  attributes;  CSS  styles  and  classes; HTML form values; and element content, geometry, and data    How  to  alter  the  structure  of  a  document  by  inserting,  replacing, wrapping, and deleting elements    How to use jQuery’s cross-browser event model   How to produce animated visual effects with jQuery   jQuery’s Ajax utilities for making scripted HTTP requests   jQuery’s utility functions   The  full  syntax  of  jQuery’s  selectors,  and  how  to  use  jQuery’s advanced selection methods    How to extend jQuery by using and writing plugins   The jQuery UI library  The  end  of  this  book  is  a  quick  reference  to  all  of  jQuery’s methods and functions.  2  Chapter 1: Introduction to jQuery   jQuery Basics The  jQuery  library  defines  a  single  global  function  named jQuery  . This function is so frequently used that the library also defines the global symbol $ as a shortcut for it. These are the only two symbols jQuery defines in the global namespace.*  This single global function with two names is the central query function for jQuery. Here, for example, is how we ask for the set of all   tags in a document:  var divs = $ "div" ;  The value returned by this function represents a set of zero or more DOM elements and is known as a jQuery object. Note that jQuery   is a factory function rather than a constructor: it returns a newly created object, but it is not used with the new keyword. jQuery objects define many methods for operating on the sets of elements they represent, and most of this book is devoted to explaining those methods. Below, for example, is code  that  finds,  highlights,  and  quickly  displays  all  hidden   tags that have a class of “more”:  $ "p.more" .css "background-color", "gray" .show "fast" ; The css   method operates on the jQuery object returned by $  , and returns that same object so that the show   method can  be  invoked  next  in  a  compact  “method  chain”.  This method-chaining idiom is common in jQuery programming. As another example, the code below finds all elements in the document that have the CSS class “hide”, and registers an event handler on each one. That event handler is invoked when the user  clicks  on  the  element,  making  it  slowly  “slide  up”  and disappear:  $ ".hide" .click function   { $ this .slideUp "slow" ; } ;  * If  you  use  $  in  your  own  code,  or  are  using  another  library—such  as Prototype—that uses $, you can call jQuery.noConflict   to restore $ to its original value.  jQuery Basics   3   Obtaining jQuery  The jQuery library is free software you can download from http:  jquery.com. Once you have the code, you can include it in your web pages with a   tag:      At the time of this writing, the current version of jQuery is 1.4.4. The “min” in the filename above indicates that this is the minimized version of the library, with unnecessary com- ments  and  whitespace  removed,  and  internal  identifiers  re- placed with shorter ones.  Another way to use jQuery in your web applications is to allow a content distribution network to serve it using a URL like one of these:  http:  code.jquery.com jquery-1.4.4.min.js  http:  ajax.microsoft.com ajax jquery jquery-1.4.4.min.js  http:  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.4.4 jquery.min.js  Replace the “1.4.4” version number in the URLs above as nec- essary. If you use the Google CDN, you can use “1.4” to get the latest release in the 1.4.x series, or just “1” to get the most current release less than 2.0. The major advantage of loading jQuery  from  well-known  URLs  like  these  is  that  because  of jQuery’s popularity, visitors to your website will likely already have  a  copy  of  the  library  in  their  browser’s  cache  and  no download will be necessary.  The jQuery   Function The jQuery   function  a.k.a. $    is the most important one in the jQuery library. It is heavily overloaded, however, and there are four different ways you can invoke it.  The first and most common way to invoke $   is to pass a CSS selector  a string  to it. When called this way, it returns the set of elements from the current document that match the selector.  4  Chapter 1: Introduction to jQuery   jQuery supports most of the CSS3 selector syntax, plus some extensions of its own. Complete details of the jQuery selector syntax are in “jQuery Selectors” on page 89. If you pass an element or a jQuery object as the second argument to $  , it returns only matching descendants of the specified element  or elements .  This  optional  second  argument  value  defines  the starting point  or points  for the query and is often called the context.  The second way to invoke $   is to pass it an Element, Docu- ment, or Window object. Called like this, it simply wraps the element, document, or window in a jQuery object and returns that object, allowing you to use jQuery methods to manipulate the element rather than using raw DOM methods. It is com- mon to see jQuery programs call $ document  or $ this , for example. jQuery objects can represent more than one element in a document, and you can also pass an array of elements to $  . In this case, the returned jQuery object represents the set of elements in your array.  The third way to invoke $   is to pass it a string of HTML text. When you do this, jQuery creates the HTML element  or ele- ments  described by that text and then returns a jQuery object representing  those  elements.  jQuery  does  not  automatically insert the newly created elements into the document, but the jQuery methods described in Chapter 3 allow you to easily in- sert them where you want them. Note that you cannot pass plain text when you invoke $   in this way, or jQuery will think you are passing a CSS selector. For this style of invocation, the string you pass to $   must include at least one HTML tag with angle brackets.  When invoked in this third way, $   accepts an optional second argument.  You  can  pass  a  Document  object  to  specify  the document with which the elements are to be associated.  If you are creating elements to be inserted into an  , for ex- ample, you’ll need to explicitly specify the Document object of that frame.  Or, you can pass a second argument that specifies the names and values of attributes to set on the newly created elements as an object:  The jQuery   Function  5   var img = $ " ",         Create a new   tag             { src:url,        With this src attribute               alt:desc } ;    And this alt attribute  Finally, the fourth way to invoke $   is to pass a function to it. If you do this, the function you pass will be invoked when the document has been loaded and the DOM is ready to be ma- nipulated. It is very common to see jQuery programs written as anonymous functions defined within a call to jQuery  : jQuery function   {    Invoked when document has loaded        All jQuery code goes here } ;  You’ll sometimes see $ f  written using the older and more verbose form: $ document .ready f . The function you pass to jQuery   will be invoked with the document object as its this value and with the jQuery function as its single argument. This means that you can undefine the global $ function and still use that convenient alias locally with this idiom:  jQuery.noConflict  ;     Restore $ to its original state jQuery function $  {          Use $ as a local alias for the jQuery object        Put all your jQuery code here } ;  jQuery  triggers  functions  registered  through  $    when  the “DOMContentLoaded”  event  is  fired,  or,  in  browsers  that don’t support that event, when the “load” event is fired. This means that the document will be completely parsed, but that external resources such as images may not be loaded yet. If you pass a function to $   after the DOM is ready, that function will be invoked immediately—before $   returns. The jQuery library also uses the jQuery   function as its name- space, and defines a number of utility functions and properties under it. The jQuery.noConflict   function mentioned above is  one  such  utility  function.  Others  include  jQuery.each   for general-purpose iteration and jQuery.parseJSON   for pars- ing  JSON  text.  Chapter  7  lists  general-purpose  utility  6  Chapter 1: Introduction to jQuery   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  functions, and other jQuery functions are described through- out this book.  jQuery Terminology  Let’s pause here to define some important terms and phrases that you’ll see throughout this book:  “the jQuery function”  The jQuery function is the value of jQuery or of $. This is the  function  that  creates  jQuery  objects  and  registers handlers to be invoked when the DOM is ready; it also serves as the jQuery namespace. I usually refer to it as $  . Because it serves as a namespace, the jQuery function might also be called “the global jQuery object”, but it is very important not to confuse it with “a jQuery object”.  “a jQuery object”  A jQuery object is an object returned by the jQuery func- tion. A jQuery object represents a set of document ele- ments and can also be called a “jQuery result”, a “jQuery set”, or a “wrapped set”.  “the selected elements”  When you pass a CSS selector to the jQuery function, it returns a jQuery object that represents the set of docu- ment elements matching that selector. When describing the methods of the jQuery object, I’ll often use the phrase “the selected elements” to refer to those matching ele- ments.  For  example,  to  explain  the  attr    method,  I might write, “the attr   method sets HTML attributes on the selected elements”, rather than a more precise but awkward  description  like,  “the  attr    method  sets HTML attributes on the elements of the jQuery object on which it was invoked”. Note that the word “selected” re- fers to the CSS selector and has nothing to do with any selection performed by the user.  “a jQuery function”  This is a function like jQuery.noConflict   that is defined in the namespace of the jQuery function. jQuery func- tions might also be described as “static methods”.  The jQuery   Function  7   “a jQuery method”  A jQuery method is a method of a jQuery object returned by the jQuery function. The most important part of the jQuery library is the powerful methods it defines.  The  distinction  between  jQuery  functions  and  methods  is sometimes tricky because a number of functions and methods have the same name. Note the differences between these two lines of code:     Call the jQuery function each   to invoke the    function f once for each element of the array a $.each a,f ;     Call the jQuery   function to obtain a jQuery    object that represents all   elements in the    document. Then call the each   method of that     jQuery object to invoke the function f once for     each selected element. $ "a" .each f ;  The  official  jQuery  documentation  at  http:  jquery.com  uses names  like  $.each  to  refer  to  jQuery  functions,  and  names like .each  with a period but without a dollar sign  to refer to jQuery methods. In this book, I’ll use the term “function” and “method” instead. Usually it will be clear from the context that is being discussed.  Queries and Query Results When  you  pass  a  jQuery  selector  string  to  $  ,  it  returns  a jQuery object that represents the set of matched  or “selected”  elements. jQuery selectors are very much like the CSS selectors you use in stylesheets. For example:  div               all   elements surname          the element with id="surname" .warning          all elements with class="warning"  8  Chapter 1: Introduction to jQuery   $   vs. querySelectorAll    The  $    function  is  similar  to  the  Document  method querySelectorAll  : both take a CSS selector as their argument and return an array-like object that holds the elements that match  the  selector.  The  implementation  uses querySelectorAll   in browsers that support it, but there are good reasons to use $   instead of querySelectorAll   in your own code:  jQuery     querySelectorAll   has only recently been implemented by browser vendors, whereas $   works in older browsers as well as new ones.    Because  jQuery  can  perform  selections  “by  hand”,  the CSS3 selectors supported by $   work in all browsers, not just those browsers that support CSS3.    The array-like object returned by $    a jQuery object  is much more useful than the array-like object  a NodeList  returned by querySelectorAll  .  The specific selector syntax supported by jQuery is detailed in “jQuery  Selectors”  on  page  89.  Rather  than  focus  on  those advanced selector details now, we’re going to first explore what you can do with the results of a query.  The value returned by $   is a jQuery object. jQuery objects are array-like: they have a length property and numeric prop- erties from 0 to length-1. This means that you can access the contents of the jQuery object using standard square-bracket array notation:  $ "body" .length     => 1: documents have only one body $ "body" [0]         This the same as document.body  If you prefer not to use array notation with jQuery objects, you can use the size   method instead of the length property, and the get   method instead of indexing with square brackets. If you need to convert a jQuery object to a true array, call the toArray   method.  Queries and Query Results   9   In addition to the length property, jQuery objects have three other properties that are sometimes of interest. The selector property is the selector string  if any  that was used when the jQuery object was created. The context property is the context object that was passed as the second argument to $  , or the Document object otherwise. Finally, all jQuery objects have a property named jquery, and testing for the existence of this property is a simple way to distinguish jQuery objects from other array-like objects. The value of the jquery property is the jQuery version number as a string:     Find all   elements in the document body var bodyscripts = $ "script", document.body ; bodyscripts.selector      => "script" bodyscripts.context       => document.body bodyscripts.jquery        => "1.4.2"  If you want to loop over all elements in a jQuery object, call the each   method instead of writing a for loop. The each   method is something like the ECMAScript 5  ES5  forEach   array method. It expects a callback function as its sole argu- ment, and invokes that callback function once for each element in the jQuery object  in document order . The callback is in- voked as a method of the matched element, so within the call- back the this keyword refers to an Element object. each   also passes the index and the element as the first and second argu- ments to the callback. Note that this and the second argument are raw document elements, not jQuery objects; if you want to use a jQuery method to manipulate the element, you’ll need to pass it to $   first. jQuery’s each   method has one feature that is quite different than forEach  : if your callback returns false for any element, iteration is terminated after that element  this is like using the break keyword in a normal loop . each   returns the jQuery object on which it is called so that it can be used in method chains. Here is an example  it uses the prepend   method that will be explained in Chapter 3 :     Number the divs of the document, up to divlast $ "div" .each function idx  {    Invoke for each          Create a jQuery object from the element  10  Chapter 1: Introduction to jQuery          And insert the index at start of it.     $ this .prepend idx + ": " ;          Stop iterating when we reach last     if  this.id === "last"           return false; } ;  Despite the power of the each   method, it is not very com- monly  used  since  jQuery  methods  usually  iterate  implicitly over the set of matched elements and operate on them all. You typically only need to use each   if you need to manipulate the matched elements in different ways. Even then, you may not need to call each   since a number of jQuery methods allow you to pass a callback function.  The jQuery library predates the ES5 array methods and defines a couple of other methods that provide similar functionality. The jQuery method  map   works much like the  Array.map   method. It accepts a callback function as its argument and in- vokes that function once for each element of the jQuery object, collecting the return values of those invocations, and returning a new jQuery object holding those return values. map   invokes the callback in the same way as the each   method: the element is passed as the this value and as the second argument, and the index of the element is passed as the first argument. If the callback returns null or undefined, that value is ignored and nothing is added to the new jQuery object for that invocation. If the callback returns an array or an array-like object  such as a jQuery object , it is “flattened” and its elements are added individually to the new jQuery object. Note that the jQuery object returned by map   may not hold document elements, but it still works as an array-like object. Here is an example:  $ ":header"                    Find all headings.     .map function   {          Map them to             return this.id;    their ids.          }      .toArray                   Convert to a true array     .sort  ;                   And sort that array  Along  with  each    and  map  ,  another  fundamental  jQuery method  is  index  .  This  method  expects  an  element  as  its  Queries and Query Results   11   argument, and it returns the index of that element in the jQuery object, or -1 if it is not found. In typical jQuery fashion, how- ever, this index   method is overloaded. If you pass a jQuery object as the argument, index   searches for the first element of that object. If you pass a string,  index   uses it as a CSS selector and returns the index of the first element of this jQuery object in the set of elements matching that selector. And if you pass no argument, index   returns the index of the first element within its sibling elements.  The final general-purpose jQuery method we’ll discuss here is is  . It takes a selector as its argument and returns true if at least one of the selected elements also matches the specified selector. You might use it in an each   callback function, for example:  $ "div" .each function   {        For each   element     if  $ this .is ":hidden"      Skip hidden elements         return;        Do something with the visible ones here } ;  12  Chapter 1: Introduction to jQuery   CHAPTER 2 Element Getters and Setters  > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  Some of the simplest and most common operations on jQuery objects are those that get or set the value of HTML attributes, CSS styles, element content, or element geometry. This chapter describes those methods. First, however, it is worth making some  generalizations  about  getter  and  setter  methods  in jQuery:    Rather than defining a pair of methods, jQuery uses a sin- gle method as both getter and setter. If you pass a new value to the method, it sets that value; if you don’t specify a value, it returns the current value.    When used as setters, these methods set values on every element in the jQuery object and then return the jQuery object to allow method chaining.    When used as a getter, these methods query only the first element of the set of elements and return a single value.  Use map   if you want to query all elements.  Since getters do not return the jQuery object they are invoked on, they can only appear at the end of a method chain.    When used as setters, these methods often accept object arguments. In this case, each property of the object speci- fies a name and a value to be set.    When used as setters, these methods often accept func- tions  as  values.  In  this  case,  the  function  is  invoked  to  13   compute the value to be set. The element that the value is being computed for is the this value: the element index is passed as the first argument to the function, and the cur- rent value is passed as the second argument.  Keep these generalizations about getters and setters in mind as you read the rest of this chapter. Each section below explains an important category of jQuery getter setter methods.  Getting and Setting HTML Attributes The attr   method is the jQuery getter setter for HTML at- tributes, and it adheres to each of the generalizations described above.  attr   handles browser incompatibilities and special cases, and allows you to use either HTML attribute names or their JavaScript property equivalents  where they differ . For example,  you  can  use  either  “for”  or  “htmlFor”,  and  either “class” or “className”. removeAttr   is a related function that completely  removes  an  attribute  from  all  selected  elements. Here are some examples:     Query the action attr of 1st form $ "form" .attr "action" ;    Set the src attribute of element with id icon $ "icon" .attr "src", "icon.gif" ;    Set 4 attributes at once $ "banner" .attr {src:"banner.gif",                    alt:"Advertisement",                    width:720, height:64} ;    Make all links load in new windows $ "a" .attr "target", "_blank" ;     Compute the target attribute to load local links    locally and load off-site links in a new window $ "a" .attr "target", function   {     if  this.host == location.host  return "_self"     else return "_blank";                 } ;    We can also pass functions like this $ "a" .attr {target: function   {...}} ;     Make all links load in this window $ "a" .removeAttr "target" ;               14  Chapter 2: Element Getters and Setters   attr   is jQuery’s master attribute-setting function, and you can use it to set things other than normal HTML attributes. If you use the attr   method to set an attribute named “css”, “val”, “html”, “text”, “data”, “width”, “height”, or “offset”, jQuery  invokes  the  method  that  has  the  same  name  as  that attribute  and  passes  whatever  value  you  specified  as  the argument.  For  example,  calling  attr "css",  {background Color:"gray"}   is  the  same  as  calling  css {background Color:"gray"} .  We’ll  learn  about  css  ,  val  ,  html  ,  and other methods in the sections that follow. Note that attr   has this  behavior  when  you  pass  one  of  these  special  attribute names  as  the  first  argument,  and  also  when  these  attribute names are used as property names in an object.  Getting and Setting CSS Attributes The css   method is very much like the attr   method, but it works with the CSS styles of an element rather than the HTML attributes of the element. When querying style values, css   returns the current style  or “computed style”  of the element: the returned value may come from the style attribute or from a stylesheet. Note that it is not possible to query compound styles such as “font” or “margin”. You must instead query in- dividual styles such as “font-weight”, “font-family”, “margin- top”, and “margin-left”. When setting styles, the css   method simply adds the style to the element’s style attribute. css   allows you to use hyphenated CSS style names  “background- color”   or  camel-case  JavaScript  style  names   “background- Color” . When querying style values, css   returns numeric values as strings, with the units suffix included. When setting, however,  it  converts  numbers  to  strings  and  adds  a  “px”  pixels  suffix to them when necessary:  $ "h1" .css "font-weight" ;    Get font weight of 1st   $ "h1" .css "fontWeight" ;     Camel case works, too $ "h1" .css "font" ;    ERROR: can't query compound style $ "h1" .css "font-variant",    Set style on all   tags             "smallcaps" ;          $ "div.note" .css "border",    Okay to set compound styles  Getting and Setting CSS Attributes   15                     "solid black 2px" ;    Set multiple styles at once $ "h1" .css { backgroundColor: "black",                 textColor: "white",               fontVariant: "small-caps",               padding: "10px 2px 4px 20px",               border: "dotted black 4px" } ;    Increase all   font sizes by 25% $ "h1" .css "font-size", function i,curval  {                   return Math.round 1.25*parseInt curval  ;             } ;  Getting and Setting CSS Classes Recall that the value of the class attribute  accessed via the className  property  in  JavaScript   is  interpreted  as  a  space- separated list of CSS class names. Usually, we want to add, remove,  or  test  for  the  presence  of  a  single  name  in  the  list rather than replace one list of classes with another. For this reason, jQuery defines convenience methods for working with the class attribute. addClass   and removeClass   add and re- move classes from the selected elements. toggleClass   adds classes to elements that don’t already have them, and removes classes from those that do. hasClass   tests for the presence of a specified class. Here are some examples:     Add a CSS class to all   tags $ "h1" .addClass "hilite" ;    Add 2 classes to   tags after   $ "h1+p" .addClass "hilite firstpara" ;    Pass a function to add a computed class to each elt. $ "section" .addClass function n  {         return "section" + n;               } ;     Remove a class from all   tags $ "p" .removeClass "hilite" ;    Multiple classes are allowed $ "p" .removeClass "hilite firstpara" ;    Remove computed classes from tags $ "section" .removeClass function n  {      return "section" + n;               } ;  16  Chapter 2: Element Getters and Setters      Remove all classes from all  s $ "div" .removeClass  ;      Toggle a CSS class: add the class if it is not    there or remove it if it is. $ "tr:odd" .toggleClass "oddrow" ;    Toggle two classes at once $ "h1" .toggleClass "big bold" ;    Toggle a computed class or classes $ "h1" .toggleClass function n  {           return "big bold h1-" + n; } ; $ "h1" .toggleClass "hilite", true ;     Like addClass $ "h1" .toggleClass "hilite", false ;    Like removeClass     Testing for CSS classes: does any   have this class? $ "p" .hasClass "firstpara"                This does the same thing. $ "lead" .is ".firstpara"                 is   is more flexible than hasClass   $ "lead" .is ".firstpara.hilite"        Note  that  the  hasClass    method  is  less  flexible  than  add Class  , removeClass  , and toggleClass  . hasClass   works for only a single class name and does not support function ar- guments. It returns true if any of the selected elements has the specified CSS class, and it returns false if none of them does. The  is    method   described  in  “Queries  and  Query  Re- sults” on page 8  is more flexible and can be used for the same purpose.  These  jQuery  methods  are  like  the  methods  of  the  HTML5 classList property. But the jQuery methods work in all brows- ers, not just those that support HTML5. Also, of course, the jQuery  methods  work  for  multiple  elements  and  can  be chained.  Getting and Setting HTML Form Values val   is a method for setting and querying the value attribute of HTML form elements, and also for querying and setting the  Getting and Setting HTML Form Values   17   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  selection  state  of  checkboxes,  radio  buttons,  and    elements:     Get value from the surname text field $ "surname" .val       Get single value from    $ "usstate" .val                    Get array of values from   $ "selectextras" .val               Get val of checked radio button $ "input:radio[name=ship]:checked" .val        Set value of a text field $ "email" .val "Invalid email address"        Check any checkboxes with these names or values $ "input:checkbox" .val ["opt1", "opt2"]       Reset all text fields to their default $ "input:text" .val function   {      return this.defaultValue; }   Getting and Setting Element Content The text   and html   methods query and set the plain-text or HTML content of an element. When invoked with no argu- ments, text   returns the plain-text content of all descendant text nodes of all matched elements. This works even in brows- ers  that  do  not  support  the  textContent  or  innerText properties.  If you invoke the html   method with no arguments, it returns the HTML content of just the first matched element. jQuery uses the innerHTML property to do this: x.html   is effectively the same as x[0].innerHTML. If you pass a string to text   or html  , that string will be used for the plain-text or HTML-formatted text content of the ele- ment, and it will replace all existing content. As with the other setter methods we’ve seen, you can also pass a function, which will be used to compute the new content string:  var t = $ "head title" .text  ;    Get document title var hdr = $ "h1" .html             Get html of first      Give each heading a section number  18  Chapter 2: Element Getters and Setters   $ "h1" .text function n, current  {        return "§" +  n+1  + ": " + current } ;  Getting and Setting Element Geometry It can be tricky to correctly determine the size and position of an  element,  especially  in  browsers  that  do  not  support getBoundingClientRect  .  jQuery  simplifies  these  computa- tions with methods that work in any browser. Note that all of the methods described here are getters, but only some can also be used as setters.  To query or set the position of an element, use the offset   method. This method measures positions relative to the docu- ment, and returns them in the form of an object with left and top properties that hold the X and Y coordinates. If you pass an object with these properties to the method, it sets the posi- tion you specify. It sets the CSS position attribute as necessary to make elements positionable:  var elt = $ "sprite" ;    The element we want to move var pos = elt.offset  ;    Get its current position pos.top += 100;            change the Y coordinate elt.offset pos ;           Set the new position     Move all   tags to the right by a distance     that depends on their position in the document. $ "h1" .offset function index,curpos  {     return {         left: curpos.left + 25*index,         top:curpos.top     }; } ;  The position   method is like offset   except that it is a getter only, and it returns element positions relative to their offset parent, rather than to the document as a whole. In the DOM, every element has an offsetParent property to which its posi- tion is relative. Positioned elements always serve as the offset parents for their descendants, but some browsers also make other elements, such as table cells, into offset parents. jQuery  Getting and Setting Element Geometry  19   only considers positioned elements to be offset parents, and the offsetParent   method of a jQuery object maps each ele- ment  to  the  nearest  positioned  ancestor  element  or  to  the   element. Note the unfortunate naming mismatch for these methods: offset   returns the absolute position of an element, in document coordinates; position   returns the off- set of an element relative to its offsetParent  . There are three getters for querying the width of an element and three for querying the height. The width   and height   methods return the basic width and height and do not include padding,  borders,  or  margins.  innerWidth    and  inner Height   return the width and height of an element plus the width and height of its padding  the word “inner” refers to the fact  that  these  methods  return  the  dimensions  measured  to the inside of the border . outerWidth   and outerHeight   nor- mally  return  the  element’s  dimensions  plus  its  padding  and border. If you pass the value true to either of these methods, they also add in the size of the element’s margins. The code below shows four different widths that you can compute for an element:  var body = $ "body" ;    Four different widths, depending on what's included var contentWidth = body.width  ; var paddingWidth = body.innerWidth  ; var borderWidth = body.outerWidth  ; var marginWidth = body.outerWidth true ;    Sums of the l and r padding, borders, and margins var padding = paddingWidth-contentWidth; var borders = borderWidth-paddingWidth; var margins = marginWidth-borderWidth;  The width   and height   methods have features that the other four methods  inner and outer  do not. One feature is that if the first element of the jQuery object is a Window or Document object, it returns the size of the window’s viewport or the full size of the document. The other methods only work for ele- ments, not windows or documents.  The other feature of the width   and height   methods is that they are setters as well as getters. If you pass a value to these  20  Chapter 2: Element Getters and Setters   methods, they set the width or height of every element in the jQuery object.  Note, however, that they cannot set the width or height of Window and Document objects.  If you pass a number, it is taken as a dimension in pixels. If you pass a string value, it is used as the value of the CSS width or height attribute and can therefore use any CSS unit. Finally, as with other set- ters, you can pass a function, which will be called to compute the width or height.  There is a minor asymmetry between the getter and setter be- havior of width   and height  . When used as getters, these methods return the dimensions of an element’s content box, excluding padding, borders, and margins. When you use them as setters, however, they simply set the CSS width and height attributes. By default, those attributes also specify the size of the content box. But if an element has its CSS box-sizing at- tribute set to border-box, the width   and height   methods set dimensions that include the padding and border. For an element  e  the  content-box  model,  calling $ e .width x .width   returns the value x. For elements that use the border-box model, however, this is not generally the case.  that  uses   The final pair of geometry-related jQuery methods are scroll Top   and scrollLeft  , which query the scrollbar positions for an element or set the scrollbar positions for all elements. These  methods  work  for  the  Window  object  as  well  as  for document elements, and when invoked on a Document, they query or set the scrollbar positions of the Window that holds the document. Unlike other setters, you cannot pass a function to scrollTop   or scrollLeft  . We can use scrollTop   as a getter and a setter, along with the height   method to define a method that scrolls the window up or down by the number of pages you specify:     Scroll the window by n pages.    n may be fractional or negative. function page n  {              Wrap the window in a jQuery object     var w = $ window ;    Getting and Setting Element Geometry  21          Get the size of a page     var pagesize = w.height  ;           Get the current scrollbar position     var current = w.scrollTop  ;         Set new scrollbar position n pages down     w.scrollTop current + n*pagesize ;   }  Getting and Setting Element Data jQuery defines a getter setter method named data   that sets or queries data associated with any document element or with the Document or Window object. The ability to associate data with any element is important and powerful: it is the basis for jQuery’s event handler registration, effecting queuing mecha- nisms. You may sometimes want to use the data   method in your own code.  To associate data with the elements in a jQuery object, call data   as a setter method, passing a name and a value as the two arguments. Alternatively, you can pass a single object to the data   setter and each property of that object will be used as a name value pair to associate with the element or elements of the jQuery object. Note, however, that when you pass an object to data  , the properties of that object replace any data previously  associated  with  the  element.  Unlike  many  of  the other setter methods we’ve seen, data   does not invoke func- tions you pass. If you pass a function as the second argument to  data  ,  that  function  is  stored,  just  as  any  other  value would be.  The data   method can also serve as a getter, of course. When invoked with no arguments, it returns an object containing all name value  pairs  associated  with  the  first  element  in  the jQuery object. When you invoke data   with a single string argument, it returns the value associated with that string for the first element.  Use the removeData   method to remove data from an element.  Using data   to set a named value to null or undefined is not  22  Chapter 2: Element Getters and Setters   the same thing as actually deleting the named value.  If you pass  a  string  to  removeData  ,  the  method  deletes  any  value associated with that string for the element. If you call remove Data   with no arguments, it removes all data associated with the element.  $ "div" .data "x", 1 ;               Set some data $ "div.nodata" .removeData "x" ;     Remove some data var x = $ 'mydiv' .data "x" ;       Query some data  jQuery also defines utility function forms of the  data   and removeData   methods. You can associate data with an indi- vidual element e using either the method or function form of data  :  $ e .data ...       The method form $.data e, ...       The function form  jQuery’s data framework does not store element data as prop- erties of the elements themselves, but it does need to add one special property to any element that has data associated with it.  Some  browsers  do  not  allow  properties  to  be  added  to  ,   , and    elements, so jQuery simply does not allow data to be associated with these elements.  Getting and Setting Element Data  23    CHAPTER 3 Altering Document Structure  > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  In “Getting and Setting Element Content” on page 18 we saw the  html    and  text    methods  for  setting  element  content. HTML documents are represented as a tree of nodes rather than a linear sequence of characters, so insertions, deletions, and replacements are not as simple as they are for strings and arrays.  The  sections  that  follow  explain  the  various  jQuery methods for more complex document modification.  Inserting and Replacing Elements Let’s  begin  with  basic  methods  for  insertions  and  replace- ments. Each of the methods demonstrated below takes an ar- gument that specifies the content that is to be inserted into the document. This can be a string of plain text or of HTML, or it can be a jQuery object, Element, or text node. The insertion is made  into,  before,  after,  or  in  place  of   depending  on  the method  each of the selected elements. If the content to be in- serted is an element that already exists in the document, it is moved from its current location. If it is to be inserted more than once,  the  element  is  cloned.  These  methods  all  return  the jQuery object on which they are called. Note, however, that after replaceWith   runs, the elements in the jQuery object are no longer in the document:  25      Add content at end of the log element $ "log" .append " "+message ;     Add section sign at start of each   $ "h1" .prepend "§" ;                  Insert a rule before and after each   $ "h1" .before " " ;            $ "h1" .after " " ;                Replace   tags with   tags $ "hr" .replaceWith " " ;          Replace   with  , keeping content $ "h2" .each function   {               var h2 = $ this ;     h2.replaceWith " " + h2.html   + " " ; } ;    after   and before   can also be called on text nodes.    Here is another way to add § at the start of each   $ "h1" .map function   {       Map each   element to     return this.firstChild;    its first content node } .before "§" ;  Each of these five structure-altering methods can also be passed a function that will be invoked to compute the value to be in- serted. As usual, if you supply such a function it will be invoked once for each selected element. The this value will be that el- ement, and the first argument will be the index of that element within  the  jQuery  object.  For  the  methods  append  , prepend  , and replaceWith  , the second argument is the cur- rent content of the element as an HTML string. For before   and after  , the function is invoked with no second argument. The five methods demonstrated above are all invoked on target elements and are passed the content that is to be inserted as an argument. Each of those five methods can be paired with an- other method that works the other way around: invoked on the content and passed the target elements as the argument. This table shows the method pairs:  26  Chapter 3: Altering Document Structure     Operation insert content at end of target insert content at start of target insert content after target insert content before target replace target with content  $ target  .method content   append    prepend    after    before    $ content  .method target   appendTo    prependTo    insertAfter    insertBefore    replaceWith    replaceAll    The methods demonstrated in the example code above are in the second column; the methods in the third column are dem- onstrated below. But first there are a few important things to understand about these pairs of methods:    If you pass a string to one of the methods in column two, it is taken as a string of HTML to insert. If you pass a string to one of the methods in column three, it is taken as a selector that identifies the target elements.  You can also identify the target elements directly by passing a jQuery object, Element, or text node.     The column three methods do not accept function argu-  ments like the column two methods do.    The methods in column two return the jQuery object on which  they  were  invoked.  The  elements  in  that  jQuery object may have new content or new siblings, but they are not themselves altered. The methods in column three are invoked on the content that is being inserted, and they return a new jQuery object that represents the new con- tent after its insertion. In particular, note that if content is inserted at multiple locations, the returned jQuery object will include one element for each location.  With  those  differences  listed,  the  code  below  performs  the same operations as the code above, using the methods in the third column instead of the methods in the second column. Notice that in the second line we can’t pass plain text  without angle brackets to identify it as HTML  to the $   method—it  Inserting and Replacing Elements   27   thinks  we’re  specifying  a  selector.  For  this  reason,  we  must explicitly create the text node that we want to insert:     Append html to log $ " +message" .appendTo "log" ;    Append text node to  s $ document.createTextNode "§"  .prependTo "h1" ;    Insert rule before and after  s $ " " .insertBefore "h1" ; $ " " .insertAfter "h1" ;    Replace   with   $ " " .replaceAll "hr" ;  Copying Elements As noted above, if you insert elements that are already part of the document, those elements will simply be moved, not cop- ied, to their new location. If you are inserting the elements in more than one place, jQuery will make copies as needed, but copies are not made for only one insertion. If you want to copy elements to a new location instead of moving them, you must first make a copy with the clone   method. clone   makes and returns a copy of each selected element  and of all descendants of those elements . The elements in the returned jQuery object are not part of the document yet, but you can insert them with one of the methods above:     Append a new div, with id "linklist" to the document $ document.body      .append "  Links  " ;    Copy all links in the document into that new div $ "a" .clone  .appendTo "linklist" ;    Add a   after each link so they don't run together $ "linklist > a" .after " " ;  clone    does  not  normally  copy  event  handlers   see  Chap- ter  4   or  other  data  you  have  associated  with  elements   see “Getting and Setting Element Data” on page 22 ; pass true if you want to clone that additional data as well.  28  Chapter 3: Altering Document Structure   Wrapping Elements Another type of insertion into an HTML document involves wrapping a new element around one or more elements. jQuery defines  three  wrapping  functions:  wrap    wraps  each  of  the selected elements, wrapInner   wraps the contents of each se- lected element, and wrapAll   wraps the selected elements as a  group.  These  methods  are  usually  passed  a  newly  created wrapper element or a string of HTML used to create a wrapper. The HTML string can include multiple nested tags, if desired, but there must be a single innermost element. If you pass a function to any of these methods, it will be invoked once in the context of each element  with the element index as its only argument  and should return the wrapper string, Element, or jQuery object. Here are some examples:     Wrap all   tags with   tags    Produces   ...   $ "h1" .wrap document.createElement "i"  ;     Wrap the content of all   tags.     Produces   ...   $ "h1" .wrapInner " " ;    Wrap the first paragraph in an anchor and div $ "body>p:first"      .wrap "    " ;    Wrap all the other paragraphs in another div $ "body>p:not :first "      .wrapAll "  " ;  Deleting Elements Along with insertions and replacements, jQuery also defines methods for deleting elements. empty   removes all children  including text nodes  of each of the selected elements without altering  the  elements  themselves.  The  remove    method,  by contrast, removes the selected elements  and all of their con- tent  from the document. remove   is normally invoked with no arguments and removes all elements in the jQuery object. If you pass an argument, however, it is treated as a selector, and  only  elements  of  the  jQuery  object  that  also  match  the  Deleting Elements   29   selector  are  removed.   If  you  just  want  to  remove  elements from the set of selected elements, without removing them from the document, use the filter   method, which is covered in “Selection Methods” on page 95.  Note that it is not neces- sary  to  remove  elements  before  reinserting  them  into  the document: you can simply insert them at a new location and they will be moved.  The remove   method removes any event handlers  see Chap- ter  4   and  other  data   see  “Getting  and  Setting  Element Data” on page 22  you may have bound to the removed ele- ments. The detach   method works just like remove   but does not remove event handlers and data. detach   may be more useful when you want to temporarily remove elements from the document for later reinsertion.  Finally, the unwrap   method performs element removal in a way that is opposite of the wrap   or wrapAll   method: it re- moves the parent of each selected element without affecting the selected elements or their siblings. That is, for each selected element, it replaces the parent of that element with its children. Unlike  remove    and  detach  ,  unwrap    does  not  accept  an optional selector argument.  30  Chapter 3: Altering Document Structure   CHAPTER 4 Events  One  of  the  difficulties  of  working  with  events  in  client-side JavaScript is that IE  until IE9  implements a different event API than all other browsers. To address this difficulty, jQuery defines a uniform event API that works in all browsers. In its simple form, the jQuery API is easier to use than the standard or IE event APIs. And in its more complex full-featured form, the jQuery API is more powerful than the standard API. The sections below have all the details.  Simple Event Handler Registration jQuery defines simple event registration methods for each of the  commonly  used  and  universally  implemented  browser events. To register an event handler for “click” events, for ex- ample, just call the click   method:     Clicking on any   gives it a gray background $ "p" .click function   {     $ this .css "background-color", "gray" ; } ;  Calling  a  jQuery  event  registration  method  registers  your handler on all of the selected elements. This is typically much easier  than  one-at-a-time  event  handler  registration  with addEventListener   or attachEvent  .  31   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  These  are  the  simple  event  handler  registration  methods jQuery defines:  blur         focusin         mousedown       mouseup   change       focusout        mouseenter      resize   click        keydown         mouseleave      scroll   dblclick     keypress        mousemove       select   error        keyup           mouseout        submit   focus        load            mouseover       unload    Most of these registration methods are for common event types with which you are probably already familiar. A few notes are in order, however. “focus” and “blur” events do not bubble, but the “focusin” and “focusout” events do, and jQuery en- sures that these events work in all browsers. Conversely, the “mouseover” and “mouseout” events do bubble, which is often inconvenient because it is difficult to know whether the mouse has left the element you’re interested in, or whether it has sim- ply  moved  out  of  one  of  the  descendants  of  that  element. “mouseenter” and “mouseleave” are nonbubbling events that solve  this  problem.  These  event  types  were  originally  intro- duced by IE, and jQuery ensures that they work correctly in all browsers.  The “resize” and “unload” event types are only ever fired on the Window object, so if you want to register handlers for these event  types,  you  should  invoke  the  resize    and  unload   methods on $ window . The scroll   method is also most often used on $ window , but it can also be used on any element that has scrollbars  such as when the CSS overflow attribute is set to  “scroll”  or  “auto” .  The  load    method  can  be  called  on $ window  to register a “load” handler for the window, but it is usually better to pass your initialization function directly to $  , as shown in “The jQuery   Function” on page 4. You can use the load   method on iframes and images, however. Note that  when  invoked  with  different  arguments,  load    is  also used  to  load  new  content   via  scripted  HTTP   into  an element—see  “The  load    Method”  on  page  63.  The error   method can be used on   elements to register han- dlers that are invoked if an image fails to load. It should not be used to set the Window onerror property.  32  Chapter 4: Events   In addition to these simple event registration methods, there are two special forms that are sometimes useful. The hover   method registers handlers for “mouseenter” and “mouseleave” events.  Calling  hover f,g   is  like  calling  mouseenter f   and then calling mouseleave g . If you pass just one argument to hover  , that function is used as the handler for both enter and leave events.  The other special event registration method is toggle  . This method binds event handler functions to the “click” event. You specify two or more handler functions and jQuery invokes one of  them  each  time  a  click  event  occurs.  If  you  call toggle f,g,h ,  for  example,  the  function  f    is  invoked  to handle the first click event, g   is invoked to handle the second, h   is invoked to handle the third, and f   is invoked again to handle  the  fourth  click  event.  Be  careful  when  using toggle  :  as  we’ll  see  in  “Simple  Effects”  on  page  52,  this method can also be used to show or hide  i.e., toggle the visi- bility of  the selected elements.  We’ll learn about other more general ways to register event handlers  in  the  section  “Advanced  Event  Handler  Registra- tion” on page 37, and we’ll end this section with one more simple and convenient way to register handlers. Recall that you can pass a string of HTML to $   to create the elements de- scribed by that string, and that you can pass  as a second ar- gument  an object of attributes to be set on the newly created elements. This second argument can be any object that you would pass to the attr   method. But, if any of the properties have the same name as the event registration methods listed above, the property value is taken as a handler function and is registered as a handler for the named event type. For example:  $ " ", {     src: image_url,     alt: image_description,     className: "translucent_image",     click: function   { $ this .css "opacity", "50%" ; } } ;  Simple Event Handler Registration  33   jQuery Event Handlers The event handler functions in the examples above expect no arguments  and  return  no  values.  It  is  quite  normal  to  write event handlers like that, but jQuery does invoke every event handler with one or more arguments, and it does pay attention to the return value of your handlers. The most important thing you should know is that every event handler is passed a jQuery event object as its first argument. The fields of this object pro- vide details  like mouse pointer coordinates  about the event. jQuery  simulates  the  W3C  standard  Event  object,  even  in browsers  that  do  not  support  it   like  IE8  and  before ,  and jQuery event objects have the same set of fields in all browsers. This  is  explained  in  detail  in  “The  jQuery  Event  Ob- ject” on page 34.  Normally,  event  handlers  are  invoked  with  only  the  single event object argument. But if you explicitly trigger an event with trigger    see “Triggering Events” on page 41 , you can pass an array of extra arguments. If you do this, those argu- ments will be passed to the event handler after the first event object argument.  Regardless  of  how  they  are  registered,  the  return  value  of  a jQuery event handler function is always significant. If a handler returns false, both the default action associated with the event and any future propagation of the event are canceled. That is, returning false is the same as calling the preventDefault   and stopPropagation   methods of the Event object. Also, when an event handler returns a value  other than undefined , jQuery stores  that  value  in  the  result  property  of  the  Event  object where  it  can  be  accessed  by  subsequently  invoked  event handlers.  The jQuery Event Object jQuery hides implementation differences among browsers by defining its own Event object. When a jQuery event handler is  34  Chapter 4: Events   invoked, it is always passed a jQuery Event object as its first argument. The jQuery Event object is based heavily on W3C standards, but it also codifies some de-facto event standards. jQuery does not define a hierarchy of Event object types, for example, there are not separate Event, MouseEvent, and Key- Event types. jQuery copies all of the following fields from the native  Event  object  into  every  jQuery  Event  object   though some of them will be undefined for certain event types : altKey        ctrlKey         newValue        screenX attrChange    currentTarget   offsetX         screenY attrName      detail          offsetY         shiftKey bubbles       eventPhase      originalTarget  srcElement button        fromElement     pageX           target cancelable    keyCode         pageY           toElement charCode      layerX          prevValue       view clientX       layerY          relatedNode     wheelDelta clientY       metaKey         relatedTarget   which  In addition to these properties, the Event object also defines the following methods:  preventDefault             isDefaultPrevented   stopPropagation            isPropagationStopped   stopImmediatePropagation   isImmediatePropagationStopped   Most of these event properties and methods are standardized by the W3C, and you can read about them in any JavaScript reference. Some of these fields, shown in the following list, are specially  handled  by  jQuery  to  give  them  a  uniform  cross- browser behavior:  metaKey  pageX, pageY  If the native event object does not have a metaKey property, jQuery sets this to the same value as the ctrlKey property. In MacOS, the Command key sets the metaKey property.  If the native event object does not define these properties but  does  define  the  viewport  coordinates  of  the  mouse pointer  in  clientX  and  clientY,  jQuery  computes  the document  coordinates  of  the  mouse  pointer  and  stores them in pageX and pageY.  The jQuery Event Object   35   target, currentTarget, relatedTarget  The target property is the document element on which the event occurred. If the native event object has a text node as the target, jQuery reports the containing Element instead. currentTarget is the element on which the current executing event handler was registered. This should al- ways be the same as this. If currentTarget is not the same as target, you’re handling an event that has bubbled up from the element on which it occurred, and it may be useful to test the target element with  the  is    method   see  “Queries  and  Query  Re- sults” on page 8 :     Ignore events that start on links if  $ event.target .is "a"   return;   relatedTarget is the other element involved in transition events  such  as  “mouseover”  and  “mouseout”.  For “mouseover”  events,  for  example,  the  relatedTarget property specifies the element that the mouse pointer exi- ted as it moved over the target. If the native event object does not define relatedTarget but does define toElement and  fromElement,  relatedTarget  is  set  from  those properties.  The time at which the event occurred, in the millisecond representation  returned  by  the  Date.getTime    method. jQuery sets the field itself to work around a long-standing bug in Firefox.  jQuery  normalizes  this  nonstandard  event  property  so that it specifies which mouse button or keyboard key was pressed during the event. For keyboard events, if the na- tive event does not define which but defines charCode or keyCode, then which will be set to whichever of those prop- erties is defined. For mouse events, if which is not defined but the button property is defined, which is set based on the button value: 0 means no buttons are pressed, 1 means the left button is pressed, 2 means the middle button is  timeStamp  which  36  Chapter 4: Events   pressed, and 3 means the right button is pressed.  Note that some browsers don’t generate mouse events for right- button clicks.   In addition, the following fields of the jQuery Event object are jQuery-specific additions that you may sometimes find useful:  data  handler  result  If additional data was specified when the event handler was  registered   see  “Advanced  Event  Handler  Registra- tion” , it is made available to the handler as the value of this field.  A reference to the event handler function currently being invoked.  The return value of the most recently invoked handler for this event, ignoring handlers that do not return a value.  originalEvent  A reference to the native Event object generated by the browser.  Advanced Event Handler Registration We’ve seen that jQuery defines quite a few simple methods for registering event handlers. Each of these simply invokes the single, more complex method bind   to bind a handler for a named event type to each of the elements in the jQuery object. Using bind   directly allows you to use advanced event regis- tration  features  that  are  not  available  through  the  simpler methods.*  * jQuery uses the term “bind” for event handler registration. ECMAScript 5, and  a  number  of  JavaScript  frameworks,  define  a  bind    method  on functions, and use the term for the association of functions with objects on which  they  are  to  be  invoked.  jQuery’s  version  of  the  Function.bind   method is a utility function named jQuery.proxy  , which you can read about in Chapter 7.  Advanced Event Handler Registration  37   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  In its simplest form, bind   expects an event type string as its first argument and an event handler function as its second. The simple event registration methods use this form of bind  . The call $ 'p' .click f , for example, is equivalent to:  $ 'p' .bind 'click', f ;  bind   can also be invoked with three arguments. In this form, the event type is the first argument and the handler function is the  third.  You  can  pass  any  value  between  those  two  and jQuery will set the data property of the Event object to the value you specify before it invokes the handler. It is sometimes useful to pass additional data to your handlers in this way without having to use closures.  There are other advanced features of bind   as well. If the first argument is a space-separated list of event types, the handler function will be registered for each of the named event types. The call $ 'a' .hover f   see “Simple Event Handler Regis- tration” on page 31 , for example, is the same as:  $ 'a' .bind 'mouseenter mouseleave', f ;  Another important feature of  bind   is that it allows you to specify a namespace  or namespaces  for your event handlers when you register them. This allows you to define groups of handlers, which comes in handy if you later want to trigger or de-register  the  handlers  in  a  particular  namespace.  Handler namespaces  are  especially  useful  for  programmers  who  are writing  libraries  or  modules  of  reusable  jQuery  code.  Event namespaces  look  like  CSS  class  selectors.  To  bind  an  event handler in a namespace, add a period and the namespace name to the event type string:     Bind f as a mouseover handler in namespace "myMod" $ 'a' .bind 'mouseover.myMod', f ;  You can even assign a handler to multiple namespaces, like this:     Bind f as a mouseout handler in two namespaces $ 'a' .bind 'mouseout.myMod.yourMod', f ;  38  Chapter 4: Events   The final feature of bind   is that the first argument can be an object that maps event names to handler functions. To reuse the hover   method example, the call $ 'a' .hover f,g  is the same as:  $ 'a' .bind {mouseenter:f, mouseleave:g} ;  When you use this form of bind  , the property names in the object you pass can be space-separated strings of event types and can include namespaces. If you specify a second argument after the first object argument, that value is used as the data argument for each of the event bindings.  jQuery has another event handler registration method: one  . This method is invoked and works just like bind  , except that the  event  handler  you  register  will  automatically  de-register itself  after  it  is  invoked.  As  the  method  name  implies,  this means that event handlers registered with one   will never be triggered more than once.  One feature that bind   and one   do not have is the ability to register  capturing  event  handlers  as  you  can  with addEventListener  . IE  until IE9  does not support capturing handlers, and jQuery does not attempt to simulate that feature.  Deregistering Event Handlers After registering an event handler with bind    or with any of the simpler event registration methods  you can deregister it with  unbind    to  prevent  it  from  being  triggered  by  future events.   Note  that  unbind    only  deregisters  event  handlers registered with bind   and related jQuery methods. It does not deregister  handlers  passed  to  addEventListener    or  the  IE method attachEvent  , and it does not remove handlers de- fined by element attributes such as onclick and onmouseover.  With no arguments, unbind   deregisters all event handlers  for all event types  for all elements in the jQuery object:     Remove all jQuery event handlers from all elements! $ '*' .unbind  ;    Deregistering Event Handlers   39   With one string argument, all handlers for the named event type  or types, if the string names more than one  are unbound from all elements in the jQuery object:     Unbind all mouseover and mouseout handlers    of all   tags $ 'a' .unbind "mouseover mouseout" ;   This is a heavy-handed approach and should not be used in modular  code  because  someone  might  also  be  using  other modules that register their own handlers for the same event types on the same elements. If your module registered event handlers  using  namespaces,  however,  you  can  use  this  one- argument version of unbind   to deregister only the handlers in your namespace:     Unbind all mouseover and mouseout handlers    in the "myMod" namespace $ 'a' .unbind "mouseover.myMod mouseout.myMod" ;     Unbind handlers for any event in the myMod namespace $ 'a' .unbind ".myMod" ;    Unbind click handlers that are in both namespaces $ 'a' .unbind "click.ns1.ns2" ;  If you want to be careful to unbind only event handlers you registered yourself, and you did not use namespaces, you must retain a reference to the event handler functions and use the two-argument version of unbind  . In this form, the first argu- ment  is  an  event  type  string   without  namespaces ,  and  the second argument is a handler function:  $ 'mybutton' .unbind 'click', myClickHandler ;  When  invoked  this  way,  unbind    deregisters  the  specified event handler function for events of the specified type  or types  from all elements in the jQuery object. Note that event han- dlers  can  be  unbound  using  this  two-argument  version  of unbind  , even when they were registered with an extra data value using the three-argument version of bind  . You can also pass a single object argument to unbind  . In this case, unbind   is invoked recursively for each property of the object. The property name is used as the event type string, and the property value is used as the handler function:  40  Chapter 4: Events   $ 'a' .unbind {     Remove specific event handlers    mouseover: mouseoverHandler,    mouseout: mouseoutHandler } ;  Finally, there is one more way that unbind   can be invoked. If you pass a jQuery Event object to it, it unbinds the event han- dler  to  which  that  event  was  passed.  Calling  unbind ev   is equivalent to unbind ev.type, ev.handler .  Triggering Events The  event  handlers  you  register  are  automatically  invoked when the user uses the mouse or keyboard, or when other kinds of events occur. Sometimes, however, it is useful to be able to trigger events manually. The simple way to do this is to invoke one of the event registration methods  like click   or mouse over    with no argument. Just as many jQuery methods serve as  both  getters  and  setters,  these  event  methods  register  an event  handler  when  invoked  with  an  argument,  and  trigger event handlers when invoked with no arguments. For example:     Act as if the user clicked the Submit button $ "my_form" .submit  ;      The submit   method in the line above synthesizes an Event object and triggers any event handlers that have been registered for the “submit” event. If none of those event handlers returns false or calls the preventDefault   method of the Event object, the form will actually be submitted. Note that events that bub- ble will do so even when triggered manually. This means that triggering an event on a selected set of elements may also trigger handlers on the ancestors of those elements.  It is important to note that jQuery’s event triggering methods will trigger any handlers registered with jQuery’s event regis- tration methods, and they will also trigger handlers defined on HTML attributes or Element properties such as onsubmit. But you  cannot  manually  trigger  event  handlers  registered  with addEventListener   or attachEvent    those handlers will still be invoked when a real event occurs, however .  Triggering Events   41   It is also important to note that jQuery’s event triggering mech- anism  is  synchronous—there  is  no  event  queue  involved. When you trigger an event, event handlers are invoked imme- diately, before the triggering method you called returns. If you trigger a “click” event, and one of the triggered handlers trig- gers a “submit” event, all of the matching submit handlers are invoked before the next “click” handler is invoked.  Methods like submit   are convenient for binding and trigger- ing events, but just as jQuery defines a more general bind   method, it also defines a more general trigger   method. Nor- mally, you invoke trigger   with an event type string as the first argument, and it triggers the handlers registered for events of  that  type  on  all  elements  in  the  jQuery  object.  So,  the submit   call above is equivalent to: $ "my_form" .trigger "submit" ;  Unlike the bind   and unbind   methods, you cannot specify more  than  one  event  type  in  this  string.  Like  bind    and unbind  , however, you can specify event namespaces to trigger only the handlers defined in that namespace. If you want to trigger only event handlers that have no namespace, append an exclamation  mark  to  the  event  type.  Handlers  registered through  properties  like  onclick  are  considered  to  have  no namespace:     Trigger button click handlers in namespace ns1 $ "button" .trigger "click.ns1" ;      Trigger button click handlers in no namespace $ "button" .trigger "click!" ;       Instead of passing an event type string as the first argument to trigger  , you can also pass an Event object  or any object that has a type property . The type property will be used to deter- mine what kind of handlers to trigger. If you specified a jQuery Event object, it will be the one passed to the triggered handlers. If you specified a plain object, a new jQuery Event object will be created, and the properties of the object you passed will be added to it. This is an easy way to pass additional data to event handlers:  42  Chapter 4: Events   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l     The onclick handler of button1 triggers    the same event on button2 $ 'button1' .click function e  {     $ 'button2' .trigger e ; } ;     Add extra property to the event object when triggering $ 'button1' .trigger {type:'click', synthetic:true} ;     Test extra property to distinguish real from synthetic $ 'button1' .click function e  {     if  e.synthetic  {...}; } ;  There is another way to pass additional data to event handlers when you trigger them manually. The value you pass as the second argument to trigger   will become the second argu- ment to each of the event handlers that is triggered. If you pass an array as the second argument, each of its elements will be passed as arguments to the triggered handlers:     Pass a single extra argument $ 'button1' .trigger "click", true ;        Pass three extra arguments $ 'button1' .trigger "click", [x,y,z] ;   Sometimes  you  may  want  to  trigger  all  handlers  for  a  given event type, regardless of which document element those han- dlers are bound to. You could select all elements with $ '*'  and then call trigger   on the result, but that would be very inefficient.  Instead,  call  the  jQuery.event.trigger    utility function,  which  takes  the  same  arguments  as  the  trigger   method but efficiently triggers event handlers for the specified event  type  throughout  the  document.  Note  that  “global events” triggered in this way do not bubble, and only handlers registered using jQuery methods  not event handlers registered with  DOM  properties  like  onclick   are  triggered  with  this technique.  After invoking event handlers, trigger    and the convenience methods that call it  perform whatever default action is asso- ciated with the triggered event  assuming that the event han- dlers didn’t return false or call preventDefault   on the event  Triggering Events   43   object .  For  example,  if  you  trigger  a  “submit”  event  on  a   element, trigger   will call the submit   method of that form,  and  if  you  trigger  a  “focus”  event  on  an  element, trigger   will call the focus   method of that element. If you want to invoke event handlers without performing the default  action,  use  triggerHandler  ,  which  works  just  like trigger    except  that  it  first  calls  the  preventDefault    and cancelBubble   methods of the Event object. This means that the synthetic event does not bubble or perform the default ac- tion associated with it.  Custom Events jQuery’s  event  management  system  is  designed  around  the standard  events  like  mouse  clicks  and  key  presses  that  web browsers generate. But it is not tied to those events, and you can  use  any  string  you  want  as  an  event  type  name.  With bind  ,  you  can  register  handlers  for  this  kind  of  “custom event”, and with trigger   you can cause those handlers to be invoked.  This kind of indirect invocation of custom event handlers turns out  to  be  quite  useful  for  writing  modular  code  and  imple- menting a publish subscribe model or the Observer pattern. When using custom events you may find it useful to trigger them  globally  with  the  jQuery.event.trigger    function  in- stead of the trigger   method:     When the user clicks the "logoff" button, broadcast a    custom event to any interested observers that need to    save their state and then navigate to the logoff page. $ "logoff" .click function   {     $.event.trigger "logoff" ;         Broadcast an event     window.location = "logoff.php";    Go to a new page } ;  We’ll  see  in  “Ajax  Events”  on  page  80  that  jQuery’s  Ajax methods broadcast custom events like this to notify interested listeners.  44  Chapter 4: Events   Live Events The bind   method binds event handlers to specific document elements,  just  as  addEventListener    and  attachEvent    do. But web applications that use jQuery often dynamically create new elements. If we’ve used bind   to bind an event handler to all     elements  in  the  document,  and  then  we  create  new document content with new   elements, those new elements will not have the same event handlers as the old ones, so they will behave differently.  jQuery  addresses  this  issue  with  “live  events”.  To  use  live events, use the delegate   and undelegate   methods instead of  bind    and  unbind  .  delegate    is  usually  invoked  on $ document  and is passed a jQuery selector string, a jQuery event type string, and a jQuery event handler function. It reg- isters an internal handler on the document or window  or on whatever elements are in the jQuery object . When an event of the specified type bubbles up to this internal handler, it deter- mines  whether  the  target  of  the  event   the  element  that  the event occurred on  matches the selector string. If so, it invokes the  specified  handler  function.  So  to  handle  “mouseover” events on both old and newly created   elements, you might register a handler like this:  $ document .delegate "a", "mouseover", linkHandler ;  Or, you might use bind   in the static portions of your docu- ment  and  then  use  delegate    to  handle  the  portions  that change dynamically:     Static event handlers for static links $ "a" .bind "mouseover", linkHandler ;    Live event handlers for dynamic parts of the document $ ".dynamic" .delegate "a", "mouseover", linkHandler ;  Just as the bind   method has a three-argument version that allows you to specify the value of the data property of the event object,  the  delegate    method  has  a  four-argument  version that allows the same thing. To use this version, pass the data  Live Events   45   value as the third argument and the handler function as the fourth.  It is important to understand that live events depend on event bubbling. By the time an event bubbles up to the document object, it may have already been passed to a number of static event handlers. And if any of those handlers called the cancel Bubble   method of the Event object, the live event handler will never be invoked.  jQuery defines a method named live   that can also be used to register live events. live   is a little harder to understand than delegate  , but it has the same two- or three-argument signature as bind   and is more commonly used. The two calls to delegate   shown above could also be written using live  :  $ "a" .live "mouseover", linkHandler ; $ "a", $ ".dynamic"  .live "mouseover", linkHandler ;  When the live   method is invoked on a jQuery object, the elements in that object are not actually used. What matters instead is the selector string and the context object  the first and  second  arguments  to  $     that  were  used  to  create  the jQuery  object.  jQuery  objects  make  these  values  available through their context and selector properties  see “Queries and Query Results” on page 8 . Normally, you invoke $   with only one argument and the context is the current document. So for a jQuery object x, the following two lines of code do the same thing:  x.live type,handler ; $ x.context .delegate x.selector, type, handler ;  To deregister live event handlers, use die   or undelegate  . die   can be invoked with one or two arguments. With one event  type  argument,  it  removes  all  live  event  handlers  that match the selector and the event type. And with an event type and handler function argument, it removes only the one speci- fied handler. Some examples:     Remove all live handlers for mouseover on   tags $ 'a' .die 'mouseover' ;    46  Chapter 4: Events      Remove just one specific live handler $ 'a' .die 'mouseover', linkHandler ;   undelegate    is  like  die    but  more  explicitly  separates  the context  the elements on which the internal event handlers are registered   and  the  selector  string.  The  calls  to  die    above could instead be written like this:     Remove all live handlers for   tags $ document .undelegate 'a' ;     Remove all live mouseover handlers for   tags $ document .undelegate 'a', 'mouseover' ;     Remove one live mouseover handler for   tags $ document .undelegate 'a', 'mouseover', linkHandler ;  Finally, undelegate   can also be called with no arguments at all. In this case, it deregisters all live event handlers that are delegated from the selected elements.

By setting the CSS visibility property, for example, you can make elements ap- pear and disappear. With clever programming, you can even produce animated visual effects. Instead of just making an el- ement disappear, for example, you might reduce the value of its opacity property over the period of a half-second so that it quickly fades away instead of just blinking out of existence. This kind of animated visual effect creates a more pleasing ex- perience for users, and jQuery makes them easy.  jQuery  defines  simple  methods  such  as  fadeIn    and  fade Out    for  basic  visual  effects.  In  addition  to  simple  effects methods, it defines an animate   method for producing more complex custom animations. The sections below explain both the  simple  effects  methods  and  the  more  general  animate   method. First, however, we’ll describe some general features of jQuery’s animation framework.  For every animation, you need to specify a duration of time— in milliseconds or by using a string—for how long the effect should last. The string “fast” means 200ms. The string “slow” means 600ms. If you specify a duration string that jQuery does not recognize, or if you omit it, you’ll get a default duration of 400ms. You can define new duration names by adding new string-to-number mappings to jQuery.fx.speeds:  49   jQuery.fx.speeds["medium-fast"] = 300; jQuery.fx.speeds["medium-slow"] = 500;  jQuery’s effects methods usually take the effect duration as an optional first argument. Some methods, however, produce an instant nonanimated effect when you omit the duration: $ "message" .fadeIn  ;           Fade in over 400ms $ "message" .fadeOut "fast" ;    Fade out over 200ms $ "message" .show  ;             Show instantly  Disabling Animations  Animated visual effects have become the norm on many web- sites, but not all users like them—some find them distracting, and others feel they cause motion sickness. Disabled users may find  that  animations  interfere  with  assistive  technology  like screen readers, and users on old hardware may feel that such effects require too much processing power. As a courtesy to your users, you should generally keep your animations simple and understated, and also provide an option to disable them completely. jQuery makes it easy to disable all effects globally: simply set jQuery.fx.off to true. This has the effect of chang- ing the duration of every animation to 0ms, making them be- have as instantaneous, nonanimated changes.  To allow end-users to disable effects, you might use code like this in your scripts:  $ ".stopmoving" .click function   {     jQuery.fx.off = true; } ;  Then, if the web designer includes an element with class “stop- moving”  on  the  page,  the  user  can  click  it  to  disable animations.  jQuery’s effects are asynchronous. When you call an animation method like fadeIn  , it returns right away and the animation is performed “in the background”. Because animation meth- ods return before the animation is complete, the second argu- ment  also optional  to many of jQuery’s effects methods is a  50  Chapter 5: Animated Effects   function that will be invoked when the effect is complete. The function is not passed any arguments, but the this value is set to  the  document  element  that  was  animated.  The  callback function is invoked once for each selected element:     Quickly fade in an element, and when it is visible,    display some text in it. $ "message" .fadeIn "fast", function   {     $ this .text "Hello World" ; } ;  Passing a callback function to an effect method allows you to perform actions at the end of an effect. Note, however, that this is not necessary when you simply want to perform multiple effects in sequence. By default, jQuery’s animations are queued  “The Animation Options Object” on page 55 shows how to override this default . If you call an animation method on an element  that  is  already  being  animated,  the  new  animation does not begin right away but is deferred until the current ani- mation  ends.  For  example,  you  can  make  an  element  blink before fading in permanently:  $ "blinker" .fadeIn 100 .fadeOut 100               .fadeIn 100 .fadeOut 100               .fadeIn  ;  jQuery’s  effects  methods  are  declared  to  accept  optional duration and callback arguments. It is also possible to invoke these methods with an object whose properties specify anima- tion options:     Pass duration and callback as object properties $ "message" .fadeIn {     duration: "fast",     complete: function  { $ this .text "Hello World" ; } } ;  Passing an object of animation objects is most commonly done with the general animate   method, but it is also possible for the simpler effects methods. Using an options object allows you to set other advanced options to control queuing and eas- ing, for example. The available options are explained in “The Animation Options Object” on page 55.  Animated Effects   51   Simple Effects jQuery defines nine simple effects methods to hide and show elements. They can be divided into three groups based on the kind of effect they perform:  fadeIn  , fadeOut  , fadeTo    These  are  the  simplest  effects:  fadeIn    and  fadeOut   animate the CSS opacity property to show or hide an el- ement. Both accept optional duration and callback argu- ments.  fadeTo    is  slightly  different:  it  expects  a  target opacity argument and animates the change from the ele- ment’s  current  opacity  to  this  target.  For  the  fadeTo   method, the duration  or options object  is required as the first argument, and the target opacity is required as the second  argument.  The  callback  function  is  an  optional third argument.  show  , hide  , toggle    The  fadeOut   method listed above makes elements in- visible but retains space for them in the document layout. The  hide    method,  by  contrast,  removes  the  elements from the layout as if the CSS display property was set to none.  When  invoked  with  no  arguments,  hide    and show   simply hide or show the selected elements imme- diately.  With  a  duration   or  options  object   argument, however,  they  animate  the  hiding  or  showing  process. hide   shrinks an element’s width and height to 0 at the same  time  that  it  reduces  the  element’s  opacity  to  0. show   reverses the process. toggle   changes the visibility state of the elements it is invoked on: if they are hidden, it calls show  ; if they are visible,  it  calls  hide  .  As  with  show    and  hide  ,  you must pass a duration or options object to toggle   to get an animated effect. Passing true to toggle   is the same as  calling  show    with  no  arguments,  and  passing false   is the same as calling hide   with no arguments. Note also that if you pass two or more function arguments  52  Chapter 5: Animated Effects   to  toggle  ,  it  registers  event  handlers,  as  described  in “Simple Event Handler Registration” on page 31.  slideDown  , slideUp  , slideToggle    slideUp    hides  the  elements  in  the  jQuery  object  by animating  their  height  to  0  and  then  setting  the  CSS display  property  to  “none”.  slideDown    reverses  the process  to  make  a  hidden  element  visible  again. slideToggle   toggles the visibility of an item using a slide up or slide down animation. Each of the three methods accepts the optional duration and callback arguments  or the options object argument .  Here is an example that invokes methods from each of these groups. Keep in mind that jQuery’s animations are queued by default, so these animations are performed one after the other:     Fade out, then show, then slide up, then slide down $ "img" .fadeOut  .show 300 .slideUp  .slideToggle  ;  Various jQuery plugins  see Chapter 9  add additional effect methods  to  the  library.  The  jQuery  UI  library   see  Chap- ter 10  includes a particularly comprehensive set of effects.  Custom Animations You can use the animate   method to produce more general animated  effects  than  are  available  with  the  simple  effects methods.  The  first  argument  to  animate    specifies  what  to animate, and the remaining arguments specify how to animate it. The first argument is required: it must be an object whose properties  specify  CSS  attributes  and  their  target  values. animate   animates the CSS properties of each element from its current value to the specified target value. So, for example, the  slideUp    effect  described  above  can  also  be  performed with code like this:     Shrink the height of all images to 0 $ "img" .animate { height: 0 } ;  Custom Animations   53   As  an  optional  second  argument,  you  can  pass  an  options object to animate  :  $ "sprite" .animate {     opacity: .25,         Animate opacity to .25     font-size: 10         Animate font size to 10 pixels }, {     duration: 500,        Animation lasts 1 2 second     complete: function   {       Call this when done         this.text "Goodbye" ;    Change element text.     }  } ;  Instead of passing an options object as the second argument, animate   also allows you to specify three of the most com- monly used options as arguments. You can pass the duration  as a number or string  as the second argument. You can specify the  name  of  an  easing  function   which  will  be  explained shortly  as the third argument. And you can specify a callback function as the fourth argument.  In the most general case, animate   accepts two object argu- ments:  the  first  specifies  what  to  animate,  and  the  second specifies how to animate it. To fully understand how to per- form  animations  with  jQuery,  there  are  additional  details about both objects that you must know.  The Animation Properties Object The first argument to animate   must be an object. The prop- erty names for this object must be CSS attribute names, and the values of those properties must be the target values toward which the animation will move. Only numeric properties can be  animated:  it  is  not  possible  to  animate  colors,  fonts,  or enumerated properties such as display. If the value of a prop- erty is a number, pixels are assumed. If the value is a string, you may specify units. If you omit the units, pixels are again assumed. To specify relative values, prefix the value string with “+=” to increase the value or with “-=” to decrease the value. For example:  54  Chapter 5: Animated Effects   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  $ "p" .animate {     "margin-left": "+=.5in",    Increase indent     opacity: "-=.1"             And decrease opacity } ;  Note the use of the quotes around the property name “margin- left” in the object literal above. The hyphen in this property name means that it is not a legal JavaScript identifier, so it must be quoted here. jQuery also allows you to use the mixed-case alternative “marginLeft”, of course.  In addition to numeric values  with optional units and “+=” and “-=” prefixes , there are three other values that can be used in jQuery animation objects. The value “hide” will save the current state of the property and then animate that property toward 0. The value “show” will animate a CSS property to- ward its saved value. If an animation uses “show”, jQuery will call the show   method when the animation completes. And if an  animation  uses  “hide”,  jQuery  will  call  hide    when  the animation completes. You can also use the value “toggle” to perform either a show or a hide depending on the current set- ting  of  the  attribute.  You  can  produce  a  “slideRight”  effect  similar  to  the  slideUp    method,  but  animating  element width  like this:  $ "img" .animate {     width: "hide",     borderLeft: "hide",     borderRight: "hide",     paddingLeft: "hide",     paddingRight: "hide" } ;  Replace the property values with “show” or “toggle” to pro- duce  sideways  slide  effects  analogous  to  slideDown    and slideToggle  .  The Animation Options Object The second argument to animate   is an optional object that holds  options  specifying  how  the  animation  is  performed. You’ve already seen two of the most important options. The  Custom Animations   55   duration property specifies the length of the animation in mil- liseconds, or as the string “fast”, “slow”, or any name you’ve defined in jQuery.fx.speeds. Another option you’ve already seen is the complete property: it specifies a function that will be called when the animation is complete. A similar property, step, specifies a function that is called for each step or frame of the animation. The element being animated is the this value, and the current value of the property being animated is passed as the first argument.  The queue property of the options object specifies whether the animation should be queued, or whether it should be deferred until any pending animations have completed. By default, ani- mations are queued, but you can disable this by setting the queue property to false. Unqueued animations start immedi- ately.  Subsequent  queued  animations  are  not  deferred  for unqueued animations. Consider the following code:  $ "img" .fadeIn 500          .animate {"width":"+=100"},                  {queue:false, duration:1000}          .fadeOut 500 ;  The fadeIn   and fadeOut   effects are queued, but the call to animate    which animates the width property for 1000ms  is not queued. The width animation begins at the same time the fadeIn   effect begins. The fadeOut   effect begins as soon as the fadeIn   effect ends—it does not wait for the width ani- mation to complete.  The  remaining  animation  options  involve  easing  functions. The easing property of the options object specifies the name of an easing function. By default, jQuery uses the sinusoidal function it calls “swing”. If you want your animations to be linear, use an options object like this: $ "img" .animate {"width":"+=100"},                  {duration: 500, easing:"linear"} ;  Recall that the duration, easing, and complete options can also be specified by arguments to animate   instead of passing an  56  Chapter 5: Animated Effects   options object. So, the animation above could also be written like this:  $ "img" .animate {"width":"+=100"}, 500, "linear" ;  Easing Functions  The straightforward but naïve way to perform animations in- volves a linear mapping between time and the value being ani- mated. If we are 100ms into a 400ms animation, for example, the animation is 25% done. If we are animating the opacity property from 1.0 to 0.0  for a fadeOut   call, perhaps , in a linear animation, the opacity should be at 0.75 at this point in the  animation.  It  turns  out,  however,  that  visual  effects  are more pleasing if they are not linear. So, jQuery interposes an “easing  function”  that  maps  from  a  time-based  completion percentage to the desired effect percentage. jQuery calls the easing function with a time-based value between 0 and 1. It returns another value between 0 and 1, and jQuery computes the value of the CSS property based on this computed value. Generally,  easing  functions  are  expected  to  return  0  when passed the value 0, and 1 when passed the value 1, of course. But they can be nonlinear between those two values, which makes the animation appear to accelerate and decelerate.  jQuery’s default easing function is a sinusoid: it starts off slow, then speeds up, then slows down again to “ease” the animation to its final value. jQuery gives its easing functions names. The default is named “swing”, and jQuery also implements a linear function named “linear”. You can add your own easing func- tions to the jQuery.easing object:  jQuery.easing["squareroot"] = Math.sqrt;  The  jQuery  UI  library  and  a  plugin  known  simply  as  “the jQuery Easing Plugin” define a comprehensive set of additional easing functions.  Finally,  jQuery’s  animation  framework  even  allows  you  to specify different easing functions for the different CSS proper- ties you want to animate. There are two different ways to ach- ieve this, demonstrated by the code below:  Custom Animations   57      Hide images, as with the hide   method, but animate    the image size linearly while the opacity is being    animated with the default "swing" easing function.     Use the specialEasing option $ "img" .animate {                     width:"hide",                     height:"hide",                     opacity:"hide"                  },{                     specialEasing: {                        width: "linear",                        height: "linear"                     }                  } ;     Or pass [target value, easing function] arrays $ "img" .animate {     width: ["hide", "linear"],     height: ["hide", "linear"],     opacity:"hide" } ;  Canceling, Delaying, and Queuing Effects jQuery defines a few more animation and queue-related meth- ods that you should know about. The stop   method is first: it stops any currently executing animations on the selected el- ements. stop   accepts two optional boolean arguments. If the first argument is true, the animation queue will be cleared for the  selected  elements,  canceling  any  pending  animations  as well as stopping the current one. The default is false: if this argument is omitted, queued animations are not canceled. The second argument specifies whether the CSS properties being animated should be left as they are currently, or whether they should be set to their final target values. true sets them to their final values; false  or omitting the argument  leaves them at whatever their current value is.  When animations are triggered by user events, you may want to cancel any current or queued animations before beginning a new one. For example:  58  Chapter 5: Animated Effects      Images become opaque when the mouse moves over them.    But don't keep queueing up animations on mouse events! $ "img" .bind {     mouseover: function   {         $ this .stop  .fadeTo 300, 1.0 ;     },     mouseout: function   {         $ this .stop  .fadeTo 300, 0.5 ;     } } ;  The  second  animation-related  method  we’ll  cover  here  is delay  ,  which  simply  adds  a  timed  delay  to  the  animation queue. Pass a duration in milliseconds  or a duration string  as the first argument and a queue name as the optional second argument  the second argument is not normally needed—we’ll talk about queue names below . You can use delay   in com- pound animations like this one:     Quickly fade out halfway, wait, then slide up $ "img" .fadeTo 100, 0.5 .delay 200 .slideUp  ;  In the stop   method example above, we used “mouseover” and “mouseout” events to animate the opacity of images. We can refine that example by adding a short delay before the ani- mation begins. That way, if the mouse quickly moves through an image without stopping, no distracting animation occurs:  $ "img" .bind {     mouseover: function   {         $ this .stop true .delay 100 .fadeTo 300, 1.0 ;     },     mouseout: function   {         $ this .stop true .fadeTo 300, 0.5 ;     } } ;  The final animation-related methods are ones that give low- level access to the jQuery queuing mechanism. jQuery queues are lists of functions to be executed in sequence. Each queue is associated with a document element  or the Document or Window objects , and each element’s queues are independent of other elements’ queues. You can add a new function to the queue with the queue   method. When your function reaches  Canceling, Delaying, and Queuing Effects   59   the head of the queue, it will be automatically dequeued and invoked. When your function is invoked, the this value is the element  with  which  it  is  associated.  Your  function  will  be passed a function as its single argument. When your function has completed its operation, it must invoke the function that was passed to it. This runs the next operation in the queue, and if you don’t call the function, the queue will stall and queued functions will never get invoked.  We’ve seen that you can pass a callback function to jQuery’s effects methods in order to perform some kind of action after the effect completes. You can achieve the same thing by queu- ing up your function:     Fade in, wait, set some text, and animate the border $ "message" .fadeIn  .delay 200 .queue function next  {     $ this .text "Hello  World" ;    Display some text     next  ;                          Run next queued item } .animate {borderWidth: "+=10px;"} ;     Grow the border  The function argument to queued functions is a new feature in jQuery 1.4. In code written for earlier versions of the library, queued  functions  dequeue  the  next  function  “manually”  by calling the dequeue   method:  $ this .dequeue  ;     Instead of next    If there is nothing in the queue, calling dequeue   does nothing. Otherwise, it removes a function from the head of the queue and invokes it, setting the this value and passing the function described above.  There are a few more heavy-handed ways to manipulate the queue. clearQueue   clears the queue. Passing an array of func- tions to queue   instead of a single function replaces the queue with the new array of functions. And calling queue   with nei- ther a function nor an array of functions returns the current queue  as  an  array.  Also,  jQuery  defines  versions  of  the queue   and dequeue   methods as utility functions. If you want to add the function f to the queue for an element e, you can use either the method or the function:  60  Chapter 5: Animated Effects      Create a jQuery object holding e, and call queue   $ e .queue f ;          Just call the jQuery.queue   utility function jQuery.queue e,f ;  Finally, note that queue  , dequeue  , and clearQueue   all take an optional queue name as their first argument. jQuery’s effects and animation methods use a queue named “fx”, which is the queue that is used if you do not specify a queue name. jQuery’s queue  mechanism  is  useful  whenever  you  need  to  perform asynchronous  operations  sequentially:  instead  of  passing  a callback function to each asynchronous operation so that it can trigger the next function in the sequence, you can use a queue to manage the sequence instead. Simply pass a queue name other than “fx”, and remember that queued functions do not execute automatically. You must explicitly call  dequeue   to run the first one, and each operation must dequeue the next one when it finishes.  > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  Canceling, Delaying, and Queuing Effects   61    CHAPTER 6 Ajax  Ajax is the popular name for web application programming techniques that use HTTP scripting to load data, without caus- ing page refreshes. Because Ajax techniques are so useful in modern web apps, jQuery includes Ajax utilities to simplify them. jQuery defines one high-level utility method and four high-level  utility  functions.  These  high-level  utilities  are  all based on the powerful low-level function jQuery.ajax  . The subsections  that  follow  describe  the  high-level  utilities  first, and then cover the jQuery.ajax   function in detail. In order to  fully  understand  the  operation  of  the  high-level  utilities, you’ll  need  to  understand  jQuery.ajax  ,  even  if  you  never need to use it explicitly.  The load   Method The load   method is the simplest of all jQuery utilities: pass it a URL, which it will asynchronously load the content of, and then insert that content into each of the selected elements, re- placing any content that is already there. For example:    Load and display a status report every 60 seconds setInterval function   {     $ "stats" .load "status_report.html" ; }, 60000 ;  63   We  also  saw  the  load    method  in  “Simple  Event  Handler Registration” on page 31 where it was used to register a handler for “load” events. If the first argument to this method is a func- tion instead of a string, it behaves as an event handler registra- tion method instead of as an Ajax method.  If you only want to display a portion of the loaded document, add a space to the URL and follow it with a jQuery selector. When the URL has loaded, the selector you specified will be used to select the portions of the loaded HTML to be displayed:     Load the temperature section of the weather report $ 'temp' .load "weather_report.html temperature" ;  Note that the selector at the end of this URL looks very much like a fragment identifier. The space is required, however, if you want jQuery to insert only the selected portion  or por- tions  of the loaded document.  The load   method accepts two optional arguments in addi- tion to the required URL. The first is data to append to the URL or  to  send  along  with  the  request.  If  you  pass  a  string,  it  is appended to the URL  after a ? or &, as needed . If you pass an object,  it  is  converted  to  a  string  of  ampersand-separated name=value pairs and sent along with the request.  The details of object-to-string conversion for Ajax are in “Passing Data to jQuery’s  Ajax  Utilities”  on  page  68 .  The  load    method normally makes an HTTP GET request, but if you pass a data object,  it  makes  a  POST  request  instead.  Here  are  two examples:     Load the weather report for a specified zipcode $ 'temp' .load "us_weather.html", "zipcode=02134" ;     Here we use an object as data and specify degrees F $ 'temp' .load "us_weather.html",                 { zipcode:02134, units:'F' } ;  64  Chapter 6: Ajax   jQuery’s Ajax Status Codes  All of jQuery’s Ajax utilities, including the load   method, in- voke callback functions to provide asynchronous notification of the success or failure of the request. The second argument to these callbacks is a string with one of the following values:  “success”  “notmodified”  This indicates that the request completed successfully.  This code indicates that the request completed normally but that the server sent an HTTP 304 “Not Modified” response, which means that the requested URL has not changed since it was last requested. This status code only occurs  if  you  set  the  ifModified  option  to  true   see “Common Options” on page 73 . jQuery 1.4 considers a “notmodified” status code a success, but earlier versions consider it an error.  This indicates that the request did not complete success- fully because of an HTTP error of some sort. For more details,  you  can  check  the  HTTP  status  code  in  the XMLHttpRequest  object,  which  is  also  passed  to  each callback.  “error”  “timeout”  “parsererror”  If an Ajax request does not complete within the timeout interval that you select, the error callback is invoked with this status code. By default, jQuery Ajax requests do not time out; you’ll only see this status code if you set the timeout option  see “Common Options” on page 73 .  This status code indicates that the HTTP request com- pleted successfully but that jQuery could not parse it in the way it expected to. This status code occurs if the server sends a malformed XML document or malformed JSON text,  for  example.  Note  that  this  status  code  is “parsererror” not “parseerror”.  The load   Method  65   Another optional argument to load   is a callback function that will be invoked when the Ajax request completes. If it’s suc- cessful, it will be invoked after the URL has been loaded and inserted into the selected elements. If you don’t specify any data,  you  can  pass  this  callback  function  as  the  second argument.  Otherwise,  it  should  be  the  third  argument.  The callback you specify will be invoked once as a method of each of the elements in the jQuery object, and it will be passed three arguments to each invocation: the complete text of the loaded URL,  a  status  code  string,  and  the  XMLHttpRequest  object that was used to load the URL. The status argument is a jQuery status code, not an HTTP status code, and it will be a string like “success”, “error”, or “timeout”.  Ajax Utility Functions The  other  high-level  jQuery  Ajax  utilities  are  functions,  not methods, and they are invoked directly through jQuery or $, not on a jQuery object. jQuery.getScript   loads and executes files of JavaScript code. jQuery.getJSON   loads a URL, parses it as JSON, and passes the resulting object to the specified call- back.  Both  of  these  functions  call  jQuery.get  ,  which  is  a more  general  purpose  URL-fetching  function.  Finally, jQuery.post   works just like  jQuery.get   but performs an HTTP POST request instead of a GET. Like the load   method, all of these functions are asynchronous: they return to their caller before anything is loaded, and they notify you of the re- sults by invoking a callback function that you specify.  jQuery.getScript   The  jQuery.getScript    function  takes  the  URL  of  a  file  of JavaScript code as its first argument. It asynchronously loads and then executes that code in the global scope. It can work for both same-origin and cross-origin scripts:     Dynamically load a script from some other server jQuery.getScript "http:  example.com js widget.js" ;  66  Chapter 6: Ajax   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  You can pass a callback function as the second argument, and if you do, jQuery will invoke that function once after the code has been loaded and executed:     Load a library and use it once it loads jQuery.getScript "js jquery.my_plugin.js", function   {     $ 'div' .my_plugin  ;     Use the library we loaded } ;  jQuery.getScript   normally uses an XMLHttpRequest object to fetch the text of the script to be executed. But for cross- domain requests  when the script is loaded by a server other than the one that served the current document , jQuery loads the script with a   tag. In the same-origin case, the first argument to your callback is the text of the script, the second argument is the status code “success”, and the third argument is  the  XMLHttpRequest  object  used  to  fetch  the  text  of  the script.  The  return  value  of  jQuery.getScript    is  also  the XMLHttpRequest object in this case. For cross-origin requests, there is no XMLHttpRequest object, and the text of the script is not captured. In this case, the callback function is called with its first and third arguments undefined, and the return value of jQuery.getScript   is also undefined. The callback function you pass to  jQuery.getScript   is in- voked only if the request completes successfully. If you need to be notified of errors as well as successes, you’ll need to use the lower-level jQuery.ajax   function. The same is true of the three other utility functions described in this section.  jQuery.getJSON   jQuery.getJSON   is like jQuery.getScript  : it fetches text and then processes it specially before invoking the specified call- back.  script, jQuery.getJSON    parses  the jQuery.parseJSON    function;  see  Chapter  7  for  more . jQuery.getJSON   is only useful when passed a callback argu- ment. If the URL is loaded successfully and its content is parsed successfully as JSON, the resulting object will be passed as the  Instead  of  executing  it   text  as  a  JSON   the  as    using   Ajax Utility Functions   67   first  argument  to  the  callback  function.  As  with  jQuery.get Script  , the second and third arguments to the callback are the status code “success” and the XMLHttpRequest object:    Suppose data.json contains the text: '{"x":1,"y":2}' jQuery.getJSON "data.json", function data  {        Now data is the object {x:1, y:2} } ;  Unlike jQuery.getScript  , jQuery.getJSON   accepts an op- tional data argument like the one passed to the load   method. If you pass data to  jQuery.getJSON  , it must be the second argument and the callback must be the third. If you do not pass any data, the callback may be the second argument. If the data is a string, it is appended to the URL, following a ? or &. If the data is an object, it is converted to a string  see the following sidebar  and then appended to the URL.  If  either  the  URL  or  data  string  passed  to  jQuery.getJSON   contains "=?" at the end of the string or before an ampersand, it is taken to specify a JSONP request. jQuery will replace the question mark with the name of a callback function it creates, and jQuery.getJSON   will then behave as if a script is being requested rather than a JSON object. This does not work for static JSON data files: it only works with server-side scripts that support JSONP. Because JSONP requests are handled as scripts, however, it does mean that JSON-formatted data can be requested cross-domain.  Passing Data to jQuery’s Ajax Utilities  Most of jQuery’s Ajax methods accept an argument  or an op- tion  that specifies data to send to the server along with the URL.  Usually  this  data  takes  the  form  of  URL-encoded name=value pairs separated from each other by ampersands.  This data format is known by the MIME type “application x- www-form-urlencoded”. You can think of it as an analog of JSON: a format for converting simple JavaScript objects to and from strings.  For HTTP GET requests, this string of data is appended to the request URL. For POST requests, it is sent as the request body, after all the HTTP headers are sent.  68  Chapter 6: Ajax   One way to obtain a string of data in this format is to call the serialize   method of a jQuery object that contains forms or form elements. To submit an HTML form using the  load   method, for example, you might use code like this:  $ "submit_button" .click function e  {     var f = this.form;    The container form element     $ f .load             Replace form by loading         f.action,             ...form url         $ f .serialize   ;    ...plus form data.     e.preventDefault  ;       Don't submit f normally     this.disabled = "disabled";    No more clicks } ;  If you set the data argument  or option  of a jQuery Ajax func- tion  to  an  object  rather  than  a  string,  jQuery  will  normally  with an exception described below  convert that object to a string  by  calling  jQuery.param  .  This  utility  function  treats object properties as name=value pairs and converts the object {x:1,y:"hello"}, for example, to the string "x=1&y=hello".  In jQuery 1.4, jQuery.param   handles more complicated Java- Script objects. If the value of an object property is an array, each element of that array will have its own name value pair in the resulting string, and the property name will have square brackets appended. And if the value of a property is an object, the property names of that nested object are placed in square brackets and appended to the outer property name:  $.param {a:[1,2,3]}           "a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3" $.param {o:{x:1,y:true}}      "o[x]=1&o[y]=true" $.param {o:{x:{y:[1]}}}       "o[x][y][]=1  For backward compatibility with jQuery 1.3 and before, you can pass true as the second argument to jQuery.param   or set the traditional option to true. This will prevent the advanced serialization of properties whose values are arrays or objects.  Occasionally,  you  may  want  to  pass  a  Document   or  some other object that should not be automatically converted  as the body of a POST request. In this case, you can set the content Type  option  to  specify  the  type  of  your  data,  and  set  the processData option to false to prevent jQuery from passing your data object to jQuery.param  .  Ajax Utility Functions   69   jQuery.get   and jQuery.post   jQuery.get   and jQuery.post   fetch the content of the speci- fied URL, passing the specified data, if any, and passing the result to the specified callback. jQuery.get   does this using an HTTP GET request, and jQuery.post   uses a POST request, but otherwise these two utility functions are the same. They both  take  the  same  three  arguments  as  jQuery.getJSON  :  a required URL, an optional data string or object, and a techni- cally optional but almost always used callback function. The callback function is invoked with the returned data as its first argument,  the  string  “success”  as  its  second,  and  the XMLHttpRequest  if there was one  as its third.     Request text and display it in an alert dialog jQuery.get "debug.txt", alert ;  In addition to the three arguments described above, these two methods accept a fourth optional argument  passed as the third argument if the data is omitted  that specifies the type of the data being requested. This fourth argument affects the way the data is processed before being passed to your callback. The load   method uses the type “html”, jQuery.getScript   uses the type “script”, and jQuery.getJSON   uses the type “json”. jQuery.get   and jQuery.post   are more flexible than those special-purpose utilities, however, and you can specify any of these  types.  The  legal  values  for  this  argument,  as  well  as jQuery’s behavior when you omit the argument, are explained in the following sidebar.  70  Chapter 6: Ajax   jQuery’s Ajax Data Types  You can pass any of the following six types as an argument to jQuery.get   or jQuery.post  . And, as we’ll see below, you can pass one of these types to jQuery.ajax   using the data Type option.  "text"  "html"  "xml"  "script"  "json"  "jsonp"  This returns the server’s response as plain text with no processing.  This type works just like “text”—the response is plain text. The  load   method uses this type and inserts the returned text into the document itself.  the  responseXML  property  of   The URL is assumed to refer to XML-formatted data, and jQuery  uses  the XMLHttpRequest  object  instead  of  the  responseText property. The value passed to the callback is a Document object representing the XML document instead of a string holding the document text.  The URL is assumed to reference a file of JavaScript, and the  returned  text  is  executed  as  a  script  before  being passed to the callback. jQuery.getScript   uses this type. When  the  type  is  “script”,  jQuery  can  handle  cross- domain  requests  using  a     tag  instead  of  an XMLHttpRequest object.  The URL is assumed to reference a file of JSON-formatted data. The value passed to the callback is the object ob- tained  by  parsing  contents  with jQuery.parseJSON     see  Chapter  7 .  jQuery.getJSON   uses this type. If the type is “json” and the URL or data string contains "=?", the type is converted to “jsonp”.  the  URL   The URL is assumed to refer to a server-side script that supports  the  JSONP  protocol  for  passing  JSON- formatted data as an argument to a client-specified func- tion. This type passes the parsed object to the callback  Ajax Utility Functions   71   function.  Because  JSONP  requests  can  be  made  with   tags, this type can be used to make cross-domain requests, like the “script” type can. When you use this type, your URL or data string should typically include a parameter like "&jsonp=?" or "&callback=?". jQuery will replace the question mark with the name of an automat- ically generated callback function.  But see the jsonp and jsonpCallback  options  in  “Uncommon  Options  and Hooks” on page 78 for alternatives.   If  you  do  not  specify  one  of  these  types  when  you  invoke jQuery.get  , jQuery.post  , or jQuery.ajax  , jQuery exam- ines  the  Content-Type  header  of  the  HTTP  response.  If  that header includes the string “xml”, an XML document is passed to the callback. If the header includes the string “json”, the data is parsed as JSON and the parsed object is passed to the callback. If it includes the string “javascript”, the data is exe- cuted as a script. Otherwise, the data is treated as plain text.  The jQuery.ajax   Function All of jQuery’s Ajax utilities end up invoking jQuery.ajax  — the  most  complicated  library. jQuery.ajax   accepts just a single argument: an options object whose properties specify many details about how to perform the  Ajax  request.  A  call  to  jQuery.getScript url,callback , for example, is equivalent to this jQuery.ajax   invocation:  in  the  entire   function   jQuery.ajax {     type: "GET",          The HTTP request method.     url: url,             The URL of the data to fetch.     data: null,           Don't add any data to the URL.     dataType:"script",    Execute response as a script.     success: callback     Call this function when done. } ;  set   You  can  fundamental  options  with jQuery.get   and jQuery.post  . jQuery.ajax   supports quite a  few  other  options,  however,  if  you  invoke  it  directly.  The  these   five   72  Chapter 6: Ajax   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  options  including the basic five shown above  are explained in detail below.  Before we dive into the options, note that you can set defaults for  any  of  these  options  by  passing  an  options  object  to jQuery.ajaxSetup  : jQuery.ajaxSetup {        Abort all Ajax requests after 2 seconds     timeout: 2000,         Defeat browser cache by adding a timestamp to URL     cache: false    } ;  After  running  the  code  above,  the  specified  timeout  and cache options will be used for all Ajax requests  including high- level ones like jQuery.get   and the load   method  that do not specify their own values for these options.  While reading about jQuery’s many options and callbacks in the sections that follow, you may find it helpful to refer to the sidebars about jQuery’s Ajax status code and data type strings in “jQuery’s Ajax Status Codes” on page 65 and “jQuery’s Ajax Data Types” on page 71.  Common Options The most commonly used jQuery.ajax   options are:  type  url  This option specifies the HTTP request method. The de- fault is “GET”, but “POST” is another commonly used value. You can specify other HTTP request methods such as “DELETE” and “PUT” but not all browsers support them. Note that this option is misleadingly named: it has nothing  to  do  with  the  data  type  of  the  request  or  re- sponse, and “method” would be a better name.  The URL to be fetched. For GET requests, the data option will be appended to this URL. jQuery may add parameters to the URL for JSONP requests and for when the cache option is false.  The jQuery.ajax   Function  73   data  dataType  Data to be appended to the URL  for GET requests  or sent in the body of the request  for POST requests . This can be a string or an object. Objects are usually converted to strings as described in “Passing Data to jQuery’s Ajax Utilities” on page 68, but see the processData option for an exception.  Specifies the type of data expected in the response and how that data should be processed by jQuery. Legal values are “text”, “html”, “script”, “json”, “jsonp”, and “xml”.  The meanings of these values were explained in “jQuery’s Ajax Data Types” on page 71.  This option has no default value.  When  left  unspecified,  jQuery  examines  the Content-Type header of the response to determine what to do with the returned data.  contentType  This specifies the HTTP Content-Type header for the re- quest.  The  default  is  “application x-www-form- urlencoded”, which is the normal value used by HTML forms and most server-side scripts. If you have set type to “POST” and want to send plain text or an XML document as the request body, you also need to set this option.  timeout  cache  A timeout, in milliseconds. If this option is set and the request has not completed within the specified timeout, the request will be aborted and the error callback will be called  with  status  “timeout”.  The  default  timeout  is  0, which means that requests continue until they complete and are never aborted.  For GET requests, if this option is set to false, jQuery will add a _= parameter to the URL or replace an existing pa- rameter with that name. The value of this parameter is set to the current time  in millisecond format . This defeats browser-based  caching  since  the  URL  will  be  different each time the request is made.  74  Chapter 6: Ajax   ifModified  When this option is set to true, jQuery records the values of the Last-Modified and If-None-Match response headers for each URL it requests, and then sets those headers in any subsequent requests for the same URL. This instructs the server to send an HTTP 304 “Not Modified” response if the URL has not changed since the last time it was re- quested. By default, this option is unset and jQuery does not set or record these headers. jQuery  translates  an  HTTP  304  response  to  the  status code “notmodified”. The “notmodified” status is not con- sidered an error, and this value is passed to the success callback instead of the normal “success” status code. Thus if you set the ifModified option, you must check the status code in your callback—if the status is “notmodified”, the first argument  the response data  will be undefined. Note that in versions of jQuery before 1.4, an HTTP 304 code was  considered  an  error  and  the  “notmodified”  status code  was  passed  to  the  error  callback  instead  of  the success  callback.  See  “jQuery’s  Ajax  Status  Co- des” on page 65 for more on jQuery’s Ajax status codes.  This option specifies whether jQuery should trigger events that describe the progress of the Ajax request. The default is true; set this option to false to disable all Ajax-related events.  See “Ajax Events” on page 80 for full event de- tails.  The name of this option is confusing: it is named “global” because jQuery normally triggers its events glob- ally rather than on a specific object.  global  Callbacks The following options specify functions to be invoked at vari- ous  stages  during  the  Ajax  request.  The  success  option  is already  familiar:  it  is  the  callback  function  that  you  pass  to methods like jQuery.getJSON  . Note that jQuery also sends  The jQuery.ajax   Function  75   notification about the progress of an Ajax request as events  unless you have set the global option to false .  context  beforeSend  success  This option specifies the object to be used as the context —the this value—for invocations of the various callback functions. This option has no default value, and if left un- set, callbacks are invoked on the options object that holds them. Setting the context option also affects the way Ajax events  are  triggered   see  “Ajax  Events”  on  page  80 .  If you set it, the value should be a Window, Document, or Element on which events can be triggered.  This option specifies a callback function that will be in- voked before the Ajax request is sent to the server. The first  argument  is  the  XMLHttpRequest  object,  and  the second is the options object for the request. The before Send callback gives programs the opportunity to set cus- tom HTTP headers on the XMLHttpRequest object. If this callback function returns false, the Ajax request will be aborted. Note that cross-domain “script” and “jsonp” re- quests do not use an XMLHttpRequest object and do not trigger the beforeSend callback.  explained   This option specifies the callback function to be invoked when  an  Ajax  request  completes  successfully.  The  first argument is the data sent by the server, the second argu- ment  is  the  jQuery  status  code,  and  the  third  is  the XMLHttpRequest  object  that  was  used  to  make  the request.  As  and jQuery.post  ” on page 70, the type of the first argument depends on the dataType option or on the Content-Type header of the server’s response. If the type is “xml”, the first argument is a Document object. If the type is “json” or  “jsonp”,  the  first  argument  is  the  object  that  results from parsing the server’s JSON-formatted response. If the type was “script”, the response is the text of the loaded script   that  script  will  already  have  been  executed,  “jQuery.get     in   76  Chapter 6: Ajax   however, so the response can usually be ignored in this case . For other types, the response is simply the text of the requested resource. The second argument status code is normally the string “success”, but if you have set the ifModified option, this argument might be “notmodified” instead. In this case, the server does not send a response and the first argument is undefined. Cross-domain requests of type “script” and “jsonp” are performed with a   tag instead of an XMLHttpRequest, so for those requests, the third argu- ment will be undefined.  This option specifies the callback function to be invoked if the Ajax request does not succeed. The first argument to this callback is the XMLHttpRequest object of the re- quest  if it used one . The second argument is the jQuery status  code.  This  may  be  “error”  for  an  HTTP  error, “timeout” for a timeout, and “parsererror” for an error that  occurred  while  parsing  the  server’s  response.  If  an XML document or JSON object is not well-formed, for example, the status code will be “parsererror”. In this case, the third argument to the error callback will be the Error object  that  was  thrown.  Note  that  requests  with  data Type “script” that return invalid JavaScript code do not cause errors. Any errors in the script are silently ignored, and the success callback is invoked instead of the error callback.  This  option  specifies  a  callback  function  to  be  invoked when the Ajax request is complete. Every Ajax request ei- ther succeeds and calls the success callback or fails and calls the error callback. jQuery invokes the complete call- back after invoking either success or error. The first ar- gument to the complete callback is the XMLHttpRequest object, and the second is the status code.  error  complete  The jQuery.ajax   Function  77   Uncommon Options and Hooks The following Ajax options are uncommonly used. Some spec- ify options that you are not likely to set, and others provide customization hooks if you need to modify jQuery’s default handling of Ajax requests.  async  Scripted HTTP requests are asynchronous by their very nature. The XMLHttpRequest object provides an option to block until the response is received, however. Set this option to false if you want jQuery to block. Setting this return  value  of option  does  not  change  jQuery.ajax  :  the XMLHttpRequest object, if it used one. For synchronous requests, you can extract the server’s response and HTTP status code from the XMLHttpRequest object yourself, or you can specify a complete callback  as you would for an asynchronous  request   if  you  want  jQuery’s  parsed  re- sponse and status code.  function  always   returns   the   the   This option specifies a function to filter or preprocess the data returned by the server. The first argument will be the raw data from the server  either as a string or Document object for XML requests , and the second argument will be  the  value  of  the  dataType  option.  If  this  function  is specified, it must return a value, and that value will be used in place of the server’s response. Note that the data Filter function is invoked before JSON parsing or script execution is performed. Also note that dataFilter is not invoked for cross-origin “script” and “jsonp” requests.  When you set the dataType option to “jsonp”, your url or data option usually includes a parameter like “jsonp=?”. If jQuery does not find such a parameter in the url or data, it inserts one, using this option as the parameter name. The default value of this option is “callback”. Set this op- tion if you are using JSONP with a server that expects a  dataFilter  jsonp  78  Chapter 6: Ajax   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  different parameter name, and you have not yet encoded that parameter into your URL or data.  jsonpCallback  For requests with dataType “jsonp”  or type “json” when the  URL  includes  a  JSONP  parameter  like  “jsonp=?” , jQuery must alter the URL to replace the question mark with the name of the wrapper function that the server will pass its data to. Normally, jQuery synthesizes a unique function name based on the current time. Set this option if you want to substitute your own function for jQuery’s. If you do this, however, it will prevent jQuery from in- voking the success and complete callbacks and from trig- gering its normal events.  processData  When  you  set  the  data  option  to  an  object   or  pass  an object as the second argument to jQuery.get   and related methods , jQuery normally converts that object to a string in  the  standard  HTML  “application x-www-form- urlencoded” format  see “Passing Data to jQuery’s Ajax Utilities” on page 68 . If you want to avoid this step  such as when you want to pass a Document object as the body of a POST request , set this option to false.  scriptCharset  For cross-origin “script” and “jsonp” requests that use a    tag,  this  option  specifies  the  value  of  the charset attribute of that tag.

In addition to invoking these individually specified callback func- tions, jQuery’s ajax functions also fire custom events at each of  the  same  stages  in  an  Ajax  request.  The  following  table shows the callback options and the corresponding events:  Callback  beforeSend  success  error  complete  Handler Registration Method  Event Type “ajaxSend” “ajaxSuccess” “ajaxError” “ajaxComplete” “ajaxStart” “ajaxStop”  ajaxSend    ajaxSuccess    ajaxError    ajaxComplete    ajaxStart    ajaxStop    You can register handlers for these custom Ajax events using the  bind    method   see  “Advanced  Event  Handler  Registra- tion” on page 37  and the event type string shown in the second column, or using the event registration methods shown in the third  column.  ajaxSuccess    and  the  other  methods  work just like the click  , mouseover  , and other simple event reg- istration  methods  of  “Simple  Event  Handler  Registra- tion” on page 31.  80  Chapter 6: Ajax   Since these are custom events generated by jQuery rather than the browser, the Event object passed to the event handler does not  contain  much  useful  detail.  The  “ajaxSend”, “ajaxSuccess”, “ajaxError”, and “ajaxComplete” events are all triggered  with  additional  arguments,  however.  Handlers  for these events will all be invoked with two extra arguments after the  event.  The  first  extra  argument  is  the  XMLHttpRequest object, and the second is the options object. This means, for example, that a handler for the “ajaxSend” event can add cus- tom  headers  to  an  XMLHttpRequest  object  just  like  the beforeSend  callback  can.  The  “ajaxError”  event  is  triggered with a third extra argument, in addition to the two just descri- bed.  This  final  argument  to  the  event  handler  is  the  Error object, if any, that was thrown when the error occurred. Sur- prisingly,  these  Ajax  events  are  not  passed  jQuery’s  status code. If the handler for an “ajaxSuccess” event needs to dis- tinguish  “success”  from  “notmodified”,  for  example,  it  will need  to  examine  the  raw  HTTP  status  code  in  the XMLHttpRequest object.  The last two events listed in the table above are different from the others, most obviously because they have no corresponding callback functions, but also because they are triggered with no extra arguments. “ajaxStart” and “ajaxStop” indicate the start and stop of Ajax-related network activity. When jQuery is not performing any Ajax requests and a new request is initiated, it fires an “ajaxStart” event. If other requests begin before this first one ends, those new requests do not cause a new “ajax- Start” event. The “ajaxStop” event is triggered when the last pending  Ajax  request  is  completed  and  jQuery  is  no  longer performing any network activity. This pair of events can be useful to show and hide some kind of “Loading...” animation or network activity icon. For example:  $ "loading_animation" .bind {     ajaxStart: function   { $ this .show  ; },     ajaxStop: function   { $ this .hide  ; } } ;  Ajax Events   81   These “ajaxStart” and “ajaxStop” event handlers can be bound to any document element: jQuery triggers them globally  see “Triggering Events” on page 41  rather than on any one par- ticular  element.  The  other  four  Ajax  events—“ajaxSend”, “ajaxSuccess”,  “ajaxError”,  and  “ajaxComplete”—are  also normally triggered globally, so you can bind handlers to any element.  If  you  set  the  context  option  in  your  call  to jQuery.ajax  , however, these four events are triggered on the context element rather than globally.  Finally, remember that you can prevent jQuery from triggering any Ajax-related events by setting the global option to false. Despite  its  confusing  name,  setting  global  to  false  stops jQuery from triggering events on a context object, as well as stopping jQuery from triggering events globally.  82  Chapter 6: Ajax   CHAPTER 7 Utility Functions  The jQuery library defines a number of utility functions  as well as two properties  that you may find useful in your programs. As you’ll see in the list below, a number of these functions now have equivalents in ECMAScript 5  ES5 . jQuery’s functions predate ES5 and work in all browsers. In alphabetical order, the utility functions are:  jQuery.browser  The browser property is not a function, but an object that you can use for client sniffing or browser testing. This ob- ject will have the property msie set to true if the browser is IE. The mozilla property will be true if the browser is Firefox  or  related.  The  webkit  property  will  be  true  for Safari and Chrome, and the opera property will be true for Opera. In addition to this browser-specific property, the version property contains the browser version number. Client sniffing is best avoided whenever possible, but you can  use  this  property  to  work  around  browser-specific bugs with code like this:  if  $.browser.mozilla &&     parseInt $.browser.version  < 4  {        Work around a hypothetical Firefox bug here. }  83   jQuery.contains    This function expects two document elements as its ar- guments. It returns true if the first element contains the second element, and returns false otherwise.  jQuery.each    Unlike the each   method, which iterates only over jQuery objects,  the  jQuery.each    utility  function  iterates through the elements of an array or the properties of an object. The first argument is the array or object to be iter- ated. The second argument is the function to be called for each array element or object property. That function will be invoked with two arguments: the index or name of the array element or object property, and the value of the array element or object property. The this value for the function is the same as the second argument. If the function returns false, jQuery.each   returns immediately without com- pleting the iteration. jQuery.each   always returns its first argument. jQuery.each    enumerates  object  properties  with  an ordinary  for in  loop,  so  all  enumerable  properties  are iterated,  even  inherited  properties.  jQuery.each    enu- merates array elements in numerical order by index and does not skip the undefined properties of sparse arrays.  This function expects objects as its arguments. It copies the properties of the second and subsequent objects into the first object, overwriting any properties with the same name in the first argument. This function skips any prop- erties whose value is undefined or null. If only one object is passed, the properties of that object are copied into the jQuery  object  itself.  The  return  value  is  the  object  into which properties were copied. If the first argument is the value true, a deep or recursive copy is performed: the sec- ond argument is extended with the properties of the third  and any subsequent  objects.  jQuery.extend    84  Chapter 7: Utility Functions   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  This function is useful for cloning objects and for merging options objects with sets of defaults:  var clone = jQuery.extend {}, original ; var opts = jQuery.extend {}, defaults, user_opts ;  jQuery.globalEval    This function executes a string of JavaScript code in the global context, as if it were the contents of a   tag.  In fact, jQuery actually implements this function by cre- ating a   tag and temporarily inserting it into the document.   jQuery.grep    This function is like the ES5 filter   method of the Array object. It expects an array as its first argument and a pred- icate function as its second, and it invokes the predicate once for each element in the array, passing the element value and the element index. jQuery.grep   returns a new array that contains only those elements of the argument array for which the predicate returned true  or another truthy value . If you pass true as the third argument to jQuery.grep  ,  it  inverts  the  sense  of  the  predicate  and returns an array of elements for which the predicate re- turned false  or another falsy value .  jQuery.inArray    This  function  is  like  the  ES5  indexOf    method  of  the Array object. It expects an arbitrary value as its first argu- ment and an array  or array-like object  as its second, and it returns the first index in the array at which the value appears, or -1 if the array does not contain the value.  jQuery.isArray    jQuery.isEmptyObject  Returns true if the argument is a native Array object.  Returns  true  if  the  argument  has  no  enumerable properties.  jQuery.isFunction    Returns true if the argument is a native Function object. Note  that  in  IE  8  and  earlier,  browser  methods  like  Utility Functions   85   Window.alert   and Element.attachEvent   are not func- tions in this sense. jQuery.isPlainObject    Returns true if the argument is a “plain” object rather than an  instance  of  some  more  specialized  type  or  class  of objects.  jQuery.makeArray    If the argument is an array-like object, this function copies the  elements  of  that  object  into  a  new   true   array  and returns that array. If the argument is not array-like, this function simply returns a new array with the argument as its single element.  jQuery.map    This function is like the ES5 map   method of the Array object. It expects an array or array-like object as its first argument and a function as its second. It passes each array element along with the index of that element to the func- tion, and it returns a new array that collects the values returned by the function.  jQuery.map   differs from the ES5 map   method in a couple of ways. If your mapping function returns null, that value will not be included in the result array. And if your mapping function returns an array, the elements of that array will be added to the result rather than the array itself.  jQuery.merge    This function expects two arrays or array-like objects. It appends the elements of the second to the first and returns the first. The first array is modified, the second is not. Note that you can use this function to shallowly clone an array like this:  var clone = jQuery.merge [], original ;  jQuery.parseJSON    This function parses a JSON-formatted string and returns the resulting value. It throws an exception when passed malformed  standard JSON.parse   function in browsers that define it. Note that  jQuery   input.   uses   the   86  Chapter 7: Utility Functions   jQuery.proxy    jQuery defines only a JSON parsing function, not a JSON serialization function.  This function is something like the ES5 bind   method of the Function object. It takes a function as its first argu- ment  and  an  object  as  its  second,  and  it  returns  a  new function that invokes the function as a method of the ob- ject. It does not perform partial application of arguments like the bind   method does. jQuery.proxy   can also be invoked with an object as its first  argument  and  a  property  name  as  its  second.  The value of the named property should be a function. Invoked this  way,  jQuery.proxy o,n   returns  the  same  thing  as jQuery.proxy o[n],o . jQuery.proxy    is  intended  for  use  with  jQuery’s  event handler binding mechanism. If you bind a proxied func- tion, you can unbind it using the original function.  This is a property like jQuery.browser, but it is intended for  portable  feature  testing  rather  than  more  brittle browser testing. The value of jQuery.support is an object whose properties are all boolean values that specify the presence  or  absence  of  browser  features.  Most  of  these jQuery.support  properties  are  low-level  details  used  in- ternally  by  jQuery.  They  may  be  of  interest  to  plugin writers, but most are not generally useful to application writers. One exception is jQuery.support.boxModel: this property  is  true  if  the  browser  uses  the  CSS  standard “context-box”  model,  and  is  false  in  IE  6  and  IE  7  in quirks mode.  jQuery.support  jQuery.trim    This function is like the trim   method added to strings in ES5. It expects a string as its only argument and returns a copy of that string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.  Utility Functions   87    CHAPTER 8 Selectors and Selection Methods  We’ve been using the jQuery selection function, $  , with sim- ple CSS selectors. It is now time to study the jQuery selector grammar in depth, along with a number of methods for refining and augmenting the set of selected elements.  jQuery Selectors jQuery supports a fairly complete subset of the selector gram- mar  defined  by  the  CSS3  Selectors  draft  standard,  with  the addition of some nonstandard but very useful pseudoclasses.  The selector grammar has three layers. You’ve undoubtedly seen the simplest kind of selectors before. “test” selects an element with an id attribute of “test”, “blockquote” selects all    tags  in  the  document,  and  “div.note”  selects all   tags with a class attribute of “note”. Simple selectors can  be  combined  into  “selector  combinations”  such  as “div.note>p” and “blockquote i” by separating them with a combinator character. And simple selectors and selector com- binations can be grouped into comma-separated lists. These selector groups are the most general kind of selector that we  89   pass to $  . Before explaining selector combinations and se- lector groups, we must explain the syntax of simple selectors.  Simple Selectors A simple selector begins  explicitly or implicitly  with a tag type specification. If you are only interested in   tags, for example, your simple selector would begin with “p”. If you want to select elements without regard to their tagname, use the wildcard “*” instead. If a selector does not begin with either a tagname or a wildcard, the wildcard is implicit.  The tagname or wildcard specifies an initial set of document elements that are candidates for selection. The portion of the simple selector that follows this type specification consists of zero or more filters. The filters are applied left-to-right, in the order that they appear, and each one narrows the set of selected elements. Table 8-1 lists the filters supported by jQuery.  Table 8-1. jQuery Selector Filters  Filter  id  .class  [attr]  [attr=val]  [attr!=val]  [attr^=val]  [attr$=val]  Meaning Matches the element with an id attribute of id. Valid HTML documents never have more than one element with the same id, so this filter is usually used as a standalone selector. Matches any elements whose class attribute  when inter- preted as a list of words separated by spaces  includes the word class. Matches any elements that have an attr attribute  regard- less of its value . Matches any elements that have an attr attribute whose value is val. Matches elements that have no attr attribute, or whose attr attribute is not equal to val  jQuery extension . Matches elements whose attr attribute has a value that begins with val. Matches elements whose attr attribute has a value that ends with val.  90  Chapter 8: Selectors and Selection Methods   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  Filter  [attr*=val]  [attr~=val]  [attr=val]  :animated  :button  :checkbox  :checked  :contains text   :disabled  :empty  :enabled  :eq n   :even  :file  Meaning Matches elements whose attr attribute has a value that contains val. Matches elements whose attr attribute, when interpreted as a list of words separated by spaces, includes the word val. Thus the selector “div.note” is the same as “div[class~=note]”. Matches elements whose attr attribute has a value that begins with val and is optionally followed by a hyphen and any other character. Matches elements that are currently being animated by jQuery. Matches   and <input type="button"> elements  jQuery extension . Matches   elements  jQuery extension . This filter is most efficient when explicitly pre- fixed with the input tag: “input:checkbox”. Matches input elements that are checked. Matches elements that contain the specified text  jQuery extension . The parentheses of this filter delimit the text— no quotation marks are required. The text of the elements being filtered is determined with their textContent or innerText properties—this is the raw document text, with tags and comments stripped out. Matches disabled elements. Matches elements that have no children, including no text content. Matches elements that are not disabled. Matches only the nth element of the document-order zero- indexed list of matches  jQuery extension . Matches elements with even indexes in the list. Since the first element has an index of 0, this actually matches the first, third, and fifth  and so on  elements  jQuery extension . Matches   elements  jQuery extension .  jQuery Selectors   91   Filter  :first  :first-child  :gt n   :has sel   :header  :hidden  :image  :input  :last  :last-child  :lt n   :not sel   :nth n   :nth-child n   Meaning Matches only the first element in the list. Same as :eq 0   jQuery extension . Matches only elements that are the first child of their parent. Note that this is completely different than :first. Matches elements in the document-order list of matches whose zero-based index is greater than n  jQuery extension . Matches elements that have a descendant matching the nested selector sel. Matches any header tag:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , or    jQuery extension . Matches any element that is not visible on the screen: roughly those elements whose offsetWidth and offsetHeight are 0. Matches   elements. Note that this does not match   tags  jQuery extension . Matches user input elements:  ,  ,  , and    jQuery extension . Matches the last element in the list of matches  jQuery extension . Matches any element that is the last child of its parent. Note that this is not the same as :last. Matches all elements in the document-order list of matches whose zero-based index is less than n  jQuery extension . Matches elements that are not matched by the nested selector sel. A synonym for :eq n   jQuery extension . Matches elements that are the nth child of their parent. n can be a number, the word “even”, the word “odd”, or a formula. Use :nth-child even  to select elements that are the second and fourth  and so on  in their parents’ list of children. Use :nth-child odd  to select elements that are first, third, and so on.  Most generally, n can be a formula of the form xn or xn+y, where x and y are integers and n is the literal letter n. Thus  92  Chapter 8: Selectors and Selection Methods   Filter  :odd  :only-child  :parent  :password  :radio  :reset  :selected  :submit  :text  :visible  Meaning nth-child 3n+1  selects the first, fourth, and seventh  and so on  elements.  Note that this filter uses one-based indexes, so an element that is the first child of its parent is considered odd and is matched by 3n+1, not 3n. Contrast this with the :even and :odd filters that are based on an element’s zero-based position in the list of matches. Matches elements with odd  zero-based  indexes in the list. Note that elements 1 and 3 are the 2nd and 4th matched element, respectively  jQuery extension . Matches elements that are the only child of their parent. Matches elements that are parents. This is the opposite of :empty  jQuery extension . Matches   elements  jQuery extension . Matches   elements  jQuery extension . Matches   and <button type="reset"> elements  jQuery extension . Matches   tags that are selected. Use :checked for selected checkboxes and radio buttons  jQuery extension . Matches   and <button type="submit"> elements  jQuery extension . Matches   elements  jQuery extension . Matches all elements that are currently visible: roughly those that have non-zero offsetWidth and offsetHeight. This is the opposite of :hidden.  Notice that some of the filters listed in Table 8-1 accept argu- ments within parentheses. The following selector, for example, selects paragraphs that are the first or every third subsequent child of their parent, as long as they contain the word “Java- Script” and do not contain an   tag:  jQuery Selectors   93   p:nth-child 3n+1 :text JavaScript :not :has a    Filters typically run most efficiently if prefixed with a tag type. Rather than simply using “:radio” to select radio buttons, for example, it is better to use “input:radio”. The exception is id filters, which are most efficient when they stand alone. The selector “address” is typically more efficient than the more explicit “formaddress”, for example.  Selector Combinations Simple selectors can be combined to use special operators or combinators  to  represent  relationships  between  elements  in the document tree. Table 8-2 lists the selector combinations supported by jQuery. These are the same selector combina- tions that CSS3 supports.  Table 8-2. jQuery Selector Combinations  Combination  A B  A > B  A + B  A ~ B  Meaning Selects document elements matching selector B that are descend- ants of elements that match selector A. Note that the combinator character is simply whitespace for this combination. Selects document elements that match selector B that are direct children of elements that match selector A. Selects document elements that match selector B and immediately follow  ignoring text nodes and comments  elements that match selector A. Selects document elements matching B that are sibling elements that come after elements that match A.  Here are some example selector combinations:  "blockquote i"         Matches   within a   "ol > li"                as a direct child of   "output + *"          The sibling after the output elt "div.note > h1 + p"      after   inside a div.note  Note that selector combinations are not limited to combina- tions of two selectors: three or more selectors are allowed, too. Selector combinations are processed left-to-right.  94  Chapter 8: Selectors and Selection Methods   Selector Groups A selector group, which is the kind of selector that we pass to $    or use in a stylesheet , is simply a comma-separated list of one or more simple selectors or selector combinations. A se- lector group matches all elements that match any of the selector combinations in the group. For our purposes here, even a sim- ple selector can be considered a selector combination. Here are some example selector groups:  "h1, h2, h3"           All  ,   and   tags "p1, p2, p3"        Elements with id p1, p2 and p3 "div.note, p.note"     Any   or   with class="note" "body>p,div.note>p"      children of   or div.note  Note that the CSS and jQuery selector syntax use parentheses for some of the filters in simple selectors, but they do not allow parentheses to be used more generally for grouping. You can- not put a selector group or selector combination in parentheses and treat it like a simple selector, for example:   h1, h2, h3 +p           Not legal h1+p, h2+p, h3+p         Write this instead  Selection Methods In addition to the selector grammar supported by $  , jQuery defines  a  number  of  selection  methods.  Most  of  the  jQuery methods we’ve seen so far in this chapter perform some action on the selected elements. The selection methods are different: they alter the set of selected elements by refining it, augmenting it, or just using it as a starting point for a new selection.  This section describes these selection methods. You’ll notice that many of the methods provide the same functionality as the selector grammar itself.  The simplest way to refine a selection is by its position within the selection. first   returns the jQuery object that contains only the first selected element, and last   returns the jQuery object that contains only the last element. More generally, the  Selection Methods   95   eq    method  returns  a  jQuery  object  that  contains  only  the single selected element at the specified index.  In jQuery 1.4, negative indexes are allowed and count from the end of the selection.  Note that these methods return a jQuery object with a single element. This is different than regular array indexing, which returns a single element with no jQuery object wrapped around it:  var paras = $ "p" ; paras.first              Select only the first   tag paras.last               Select only the last   paras.eq 1               Select the second   paras.eq -2              Select the second to last   paras[1]                 The second   tag, itself  jQuery  slice    method  works   The  general  method  for  refining  a  selection  by  position  is slice  .  The  like  the Array.slice   method: it accepts a start and an end index  with negative indexes measured from the end of the array , and re- turns a jQuery object that contains elements from the start in- dex up to, but not including, the end index. If the end index is omitted, the returned object includes all elements at or after the start index:  $ "p" .slice 2,5       The 3rd, 4th and 5th   tags $ "div" .slice -3      The last three   tags  filter   is a general-purpose selection filtering method, and you can invoke it in three different ways:    If you pass a selector string to filter  , it returns a jQuery object containing only those selected elements that also match that selector.    If you pass another jQuery object to filter  , it returns a new jQuery object that contains the intersection of the two  jQuery  objects.  You  can  also  pass  an  array  of  ele- ments, or even a single document element, to filter  .    If you pass a predicate function to filter  , that function is called for each matched element, and filter   returns a jQuery object containing only those elements for which the  predicate  returned  true   or  any  truthy  value .  The predicate function is called with the element as its this  96  Chapter 8: Selectors and Selection Methods   value, and the element index as an argument.  See also jQuery.grep   in Chapter 7.   $ "div" .filter ".note"          Like $ "div.note"  $ "div" .filter $ ".note"        Like $ "div.note"  $ "div" .filter function i  {    Like $ "div:even"      return i % 2 == 0 }   The not   method is just like filter   except that it inverts the sense of the filter. If you pass a selector string to not  , it returns a new jQuery object containing only the selected elements that do not match the selector. If you pass a jQuery object or an array of elements or a single element, not   returns all of the selected elements except for those elements you’ve explicitly excluded. If you pass a predicate function to not  , it is invoked just as it is for filter  , but the returned jQuery object includes only those elements for which the predicate returns false  or a falsy value :     All   tags except two special ones $ "div" .not "header, footer" ;    In jQuery 1.4, the has   method is another way to refine a se- lection. If you pass a selector, it returns a new jQuery object that contains only the selected elements that have a descendant that matches the selector. If you pass a document element to has  , it refines the selection to match only those elements that are ancestors of the specified element:  $ "p" .has "a[href]"      Paragraphs that include links  The add   method augments a selection rather than filtering or refining it. You can invoke add   with any arguments  other than a function  that you would pass to $  . add   returns the originally selected elements, plus whatever elements would be selected  or created  by the arguments if those arguments were passed to $  . add   removes duplicate elements and sorts the combined selection so that elements are in document order:     Equivalent ways to select all   and   elements $ "div, p"                Use a selector group $ "div" .add "p"          Pass a selector to add   $ "div" .add $ "p"        Pass a jQuery object to add    Selection Methods   97   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  var paras = document.getElementsByTagName "p" ;  $ "div" .add paras ;      Pass an array-like object  Using a Selection As Context The filter  , add  , and not   methods described above per- form  set  intersection,  union,  and  subtraction  operations  on independent selections. jQuery defines a number of other se- lection methods that use the current selection as the context. For each selected element, these methods make a new selection using the selected element as the context or starting point, and then  return  a  new  jQuery  object  that  contains  the  union  of those selections. As with the add   method, duplicates are re- moved and the elements are sorted so that they are in document order.  The  most  general  of  this  category  of  selection  methods  is find  . It searches the descendants of each of the currently se- lected elements for elements that match the specified selector string, and returns a new jQuery object that represents that new set of matching descendants. Note that the newly selected elements are not merged with the existing selection; they are returned as a new set of elements. Note also that find   is not the same as filter  , which simply narrows the currently se- lected set of elements without selecting new elements:     find   tags inside   tags.  Same as $ "div p"  $ "div" .find "p"     The other methods in this category return new jQuery objects that represent the children, siblings, or parents of each of the currently selected elements. Most accept an optional selector string as an argument. With no selector, they return all appro- priate children, siblings, or parents. With the selector, they fil- ter the list to return only those that match.  The children   method returns the immediate child elements of  each  selected  element,  filtering  them  with  an  optional selector:  98  Chapter 8: Selectors and Selection Methods      Find all   tags that are direct children of the    elements with ids "header" and "footer".    Same as $ "header>span,footer>span"  $ "header, footer" .children "span"   The contents   method is similar to children   but it returns all child nodes, including text nodes, of each element. Also, if any of the selected elements is an  , contents   returns the document object for the content of that  . Note that contents   does not accept an optional selector string—this is because it returns document nodes that are not elements, and selector strings only describe element nodes.  The next   and prev   methods return the next and previous sibling of each selected element that has one. If a selector is specified, the sibling is selected only if it matches the selector:  $ "h1" .next "p"     Same as $ "h1+p"  $ "h1" .prev         Sibling elements before   tags  nextAll   and prevAll   return all siblings following and pre- ceding   if  there  are  any   each  selected  element.  And  the siblings   method returns all siblings of each selected element  elements are not considered siblings of themselves . If a se- lector  is  passed  to  any  of  these  methods,  only  siblings  that match are returned:     All   siblings following the footer element $ "footer" .nextAll "p"         All siblings before the footer element $ "footer" .prevAll           In jQuery 1.4 and later, the nextUntil   and prevUntil   meth- ods take a selector argument and select all siblings following or preceding the selected element until a sibling is found that matches the selector. If you omit the selector, these methods work just like nextAll   and prevAll   with no selector. The  parent    method  returns  the  parent  of  each  selected element:  $ "li" .parent       Elements that have   children  Selection Methods   99   The  parents    method  returns  the  ancestors   up  to  the    tag   of  each  selected  element.  Both  parent    and parents   accept an optional selector string argument:  $ "a[href]" .parents "p"       tags that contain links  parentsUntil   returns the ancestors of each selected element until the first ancestor that matches the specified selector. The closest   method requires a selector string, and it returns the closest ancestor  if any  of each selected element that matches the selector. For this method, an element is considered an an- cestor of itself. In jQuery 1.4, you can also pass an ancestor element as the second argument to closest   to prevent jQuery from climbing the ancestor tree beyond the specified element:     Innermost  s that contain links $ "a[href]" .closest "div"                 All   wrappers directly around   $ "a[href]" .parentsUntil ":not div "    Reverting to a Previous Selection To  facilitate  method  chaining,  most  jQuery  object  methods return the object on which they are called. However, the meth- ods we’ve covered in this section all return new jQuery objects. Method chaining works but you must keep in mind that meth- ods called later in the chain may be operating on a different set of elements than those near the start of the chain.  The situation is a little more complicated than this, however. When the selection methods described here create and return a new jQuery object, they give that object an internal reference to the older jQuery object from which it was derived. This cre- ates a linked list or stack of jQuery objects. The end   method pops  this  stack,  returning  the  saved  jQuery  object.  Calling end   in a method chain restores the set of matched elements to its previous state. Consider the following code:     Find all   tags, then find the   tags inside.    Highlight the   tags and then give the   tags    a border. First, without method chaining: var divs = $ "div" ;                     var paras = divs.find "p" ;  100  Chapter 8: Selectors and Selection Methods   paras.addClass "highlight" ; divs.css "border", "solid black 1px" ;     Here's how we could do it with a method chain $ "div" .find "p" .addClass "highlight"      .end  .css "border", "solid black 1px" ;     Or reorder the operations and avoid the call to end   $ "div" .css "border", "solid black 1px"      .find "p" .addClass "highlight" ;  If you ever want to manually modify the set of selected elements in a way that is compatible with the end   method, pass the new set of elements as an array or array-like object to the push Stack   method. The elements you specify become the new selected elements, and the previous set of selected elements are pushed on the stack, where they can be restored with end  :  var sel = $ "div" ;      Select all   tags var paras = document.getElementsByTagName "p" ; sel.pushStack paras ;    Modify selection to all  s sel.end  ;               Restore selection to all  s  Now that we’ve covered the end   method and the selection stack  that  it  uses,  there  is  one  final  method  to  cover.  and Self   returns a new jQuery object that includes all of the el- ements of the current selection plus all of the elements  minus duplicates  of the previous selection. andSelf   works like the add   method, so “addPrev” might be a more descriptive name for it. As an example, consider the following variant on the code above: it highlights   tags and the   tags that hold them, and then adds a border to the   tags:  $ "div" .find "p"             find  s in  s     .andSelf                  merge them together     .addClass "highlight"     Highlight them all     .end  .end                Pop twice back to $ "div"      .css "border", "solid black 1px" ;    Add a border  Selection Methods   101    CHAPTER 9 Extending jQuery with Plugins  jQuery is written so that it is easy to add new functionality. Modules that add new functionality are called plugins, and you can  find  many  of  them  at  http:  plugins.jquery.com.  jQuery plugins are just ordinary files of JavaScript code, and to use them  in  your  web  pages,  you  just  include  them  with  a   tag as you would any other JavaScript library  you must include plugins after you include jQuery itself, of course .  It is almost trivially easy to write your own jQuery extensions. The trick is to know that jQuery.fn is the prototype object for all jQuery objects. If you add a function to this object, that function becomes a jQuery method. Here is an example:  jQuery.fn.println = function   {        Join arguments into a space-separated string     var msg = Array.prototype.join.call arguments, " " ;        Loop through each element in the jQuery object     this.each function   {            For each one, append the string as plain text,         jQuery this .append document.createTextNode msg               .append " " ;     then append a  .     } ;        Return the jQuery object for method chaining     return this; };  103   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  With that jQuery.fn.println function defined, we can now in- voke a println   method on any jQuery object: $ "debug" .println "x = ", x, "; y = ", y ;  It is common practice to add new methods to jQuery.fn. If you use the each   method to “manually” iterate through the ele- ments in a jQuery object and perform some kind of operation on them, consider whether it might make sense to refactor your code so that the each   invocation is moved into an extension method. If you follow basic modular coding practices when writing  your  extension,  and  abide  by  a  few  jQuery-specific conventions, you can call your extension a plugin and share it with  others.  These  are  the  jQuery  plugin  conventions  to  be aware of:    Don’t rely on the $ identifier: the including page may have called jQuery.noConflict  , and $   may no longer be a synonym for the jQuery   function. In short plugins like the one shown above, you can just use jQuery instead of $. If you are writing a longer extension, you are likely to wrap it all within one anonymous function to avoid the creation of global variables. If you do so, you can use the idiom  of  passing  the  jQuery  as  an  argument  to  your anonymous function and receiving that value in a param- eter named $:   function $  {    An function with parameter named $        Put your plugin code here } jQuery  ;    Pass the jQuery object to the function   If your extension method does not return a value of its own, be sure to return a jQuery object that can be used in a method chain. Usually this will just be the this object, which you can return unmodified. In the example above, the method ended with the line return this;. The method could have been made slightly shorter  and less readable  following another jQuery idiom: returning the result of the  each    method.  Then  the  println    method  would have  included  the  code  return  this.each function   {...} ;.  104  Chapter 9: Extending jQuery with Plugins     If your extension method has more than a couple of pa- rameters or configuration options, allow the user to pass options  in  the  form  of  an  object   as  we  saw  with  the animate   method in “Custom Animations” on page 53, and  the  jQuery.ajax    function  in  “The  jQuery.ajax   Function” on page 72 .    Don’t  pollute  the  jQuery  method  namespace.  Well- behaved  jQuery  plugins  define  the  smallest  number  of methods consistent with a usable API. It is common for jQuery  plugins  to  define  only  a  single  method  in jQuery.fn. This one method takes a string as its first ar- gument and interprets that string as the name of a function to pass its remaining arguments to. When you are able to limit  your  plugin  to  a  single  method,  the  name  of  that method should be the same as the name of the plugin. If you must define more than one method, use the plugin name as a prefix for each of your method names.    If your plugin binds event handlers, put all of those han- dlers in an event namespace  see “Advanced Event Han- dler Registration” on page 37 . Use your plugin name as the namespace name.    If your plugin uses the data   method to associate data with elements, place all of your data values in a single ob- ject, and store that object as a single value, giving it the same name as your plugin.    Save your plugin code in a file with a name of the form “jquery.plugin.js”, replacing plugin with the name of your plugin.  A plugin can add new utility functions to jQuery by adding them to the jQuery object itself. For example:     This method prints its arguments  using the println      plugin method  to the element with id "debug". If no    such element exists, it is created and added. jQuery.debug = function   {        Find the debug element     var elt = jQuery "debug" ;        Create and insert it if necessary     if  elt.length === 0  {  Extending jQuery with Plugins   105           elt = jQuery " " +                      " Debugging Output  " ;         jQuery document.body .append elt ;     }        Output the arguments to it     elt.println.apply elt, arguments ; };  In addition to defining new methods, it is also possible to ex- tend other parts of the jQuery library. In Chapter 5, for exam- ple, we saw that it is possible to add new effect duration names  in  addition  to  “fast”  and  “slow”   by  adding  properties  to jQuery.fx.speeds,  and  that  it  is  possible  to  add  new  easing functions by adding them to jQuery.easing. Plugins can even extend the jQuery CSS selector engine! You can add new pseu- doclass filters  like :first and :input  by adding properties to the jQuery.expr[':'] object. Here is an example that defines a new :draggable filter, which returns only elements that have a draggable=true attribute:  jQuery.expr[':'].draggable = function e  {     return e.draggable === true; };  With this selector defined, we can select draggable images with $ "img:draggable"  instead of the more verbose $ "img[drag gable=true]" . As you can see from the code above, a custom selector function is passed a candidate DOM element as its first argument. It should  return  true  if  the  element  matches  the  selector,  and false otherwise. Many custom selectors need only the one el- ement argument, but they are actually invoked with four ar- guments. The second argument is an integer index that gives the element’s position within an array of candidate elements. That array is passed as the fourth argument, and your selector must not modify it. The third argument is interesting: it is the array result of a call to the RegExp.exec   method. The fourth element of this array  at index 3  is the value, if any, within parentheses after the pseudoclass filter. The parentheses and any  quotes  inside  are  stripped,  leaving  only  the  argument string.  Here,  for  example,  is  how  you  could  implement  106  Chapter 9: Extending jQuery with Plugins   a :data x  pseudoclass that returns true only for arguments that have an HTML5 data-x attribute:  jQuery.expr[':'].data = function e, idx, match, array  {     return e.hasAttribute "data-" + match[3] ; };  Extending jQuery with Plugins   107    CHAPTER 10 The jQuery UI Library  jQuery limits itself to providing core DOM, CSS, event han- dling,  and  Ajax  functionality.  These  provide  an  excellent foundation for building higher-level abstractions, such as user interface widgets, and the jQuery UI library does just that. Full coverage of jQuery UI is beyond the scope of this book, but this chapter offers a simple overview. You can find the library and its documentation at http:  jqueryui.com.  As its name implies, jQuery UI defines a number of user inter- face widgets: auto-completion input fields, date pickers for en- tering dates, accordions and tabs for organizing information, sliders and progress bars for visually displaying numbers, and modal dialogs for urgent communication with the user. In ad- dition to these widgets, jQuery UI implements more general “interactions”, which allow any document element to be easily made draggable, droppable, resizable, selectable, or sortable. Finally, jQuery UI adds a number of new visual effects methods  including  the  ability  to  animate  colors   to  those  offered  by jQuery itself, and defines lots of new easing functions as well.  Think of jQuery UI as a bunch of related jQuery plugins packed into a single JavaScript file. To use it, simply include the jQuery UI script into your web page after including the jQuery code. The Download page at http:  jqueryui.com allows you to select the  components  you  plan  to  use,  and  will  build  a  custom  109   download bundle for you that may reduce your page load times compared to the full jQuery UI library.  jQuery UI is fully themeable, and its themes take the form of CSS files. So in addition to loading the jQuery UI JavaScript code into your web pages, you’ll have to include the CSS file for your selected theme as well. The jQuery UI website features a number of prebuilt themes and also a “ThemeRoller” page that allows you to customize and download your own theme.  jQuery UI widgets and interactions are structured as jQuery plugins, and each defines a single jQuery method. Typically, when you call this method on an existing document element, it transforms that element into the widget. For example, to alter a text input field so that it pops up a date picker widget when clicked or focused, simply call the datepicker   method with code like this:     Make input.date tags into date picker widgets $ "input.date" .datepicker  ;  In order to make full use of a jQuery UI widget, you must be familiar with three things: its configuration options, its meth- ods, and its events. All jQuery UI widgets are configurable, and some have many configuration options. You can customize the behavior and appearance of your widgets by passing an options object   like  the  animations  options  object  passed  to animate    to the widget method. jQuery UI widgets usually define at least a handful of “meth- ods” for interacting with the widget. In order to avoid a pro- liferation of jQuery methods, however, jQuery UI widgets do not define their “methods” as true methods. Each widget has only a single method  like the datepicker   method in the ex- ample  above .  When  you  want  to  call  a  “method”  of  the widget, you pass the name of the desired “method” to the single true method defined by the widget. To disable a date picker widget,  for  example,  you  don’t  call  disableDatepicker  ; instead, you call datepicker "disable" .  110  Chapter 10: The jQuery UI Library   jQuery  UI  widgets  generally  define  custom  events  that  they trigger  in  response  to  user  interaction.  You  can  bind  event handlers  for  these  custom  events  with  the  normal  bind   method, and you can also usually specify event handler func- tions as properties in the options object you pass to the widget method.  The  first  argument  to  these  handler  methods  is  an Event object as usual. Some widgets pass a “UI” object as the second  argument  to  the  event  handler,  which  typically  pro- vides state information about the widget.  Note that the jQuery UI documentation sometimes describes “events” that are not truly custom events and could better be described as callback functions set through the configuration options object. The date picker widget, for example, supports a number of callback functions that it can call at various times. None of these functions have the standard event handler sig- nature, however, and you cannot register handlers for these “events”  with  bind  .  Instead,  you  specify  appropriate  call- backs when you configure the widget in your initial call to the datepicker   method.  > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  The jQuery UI Library  111    CHAPTER 11 jQuery Quick Reference  This is a quick reference for the entire jQuery library. jQuery functions and methods are listed by category and are briefly described in the sections that follow.  This reference uses the following conventions in the method signatures. Arguments named sel are jQuery selectors. Argu- ments named idx are integer indexes. Arguments named elt or elts are document elements or array-like objects of docu- ment  elements.  Arguments  named  f  are  callback  functions, and nested parentheses are used to indicate the arguments that jQuery will pass to the function you supply. Square brackets indicate  optional  arguments.  If  an  optional  argument  is  fol- lowed by an equals sign and a value, that value will be used when the argument is omitted. The return value of a function or a method follows the close parenthesis and a colon. Methods with  no  return  value  specified  return  the  jQuery  object  on which they are invoked.  Factory Function The jQuery   function is a namespace for a variety of utility functions, but it is also the factory function for creating jQuery objects. jQuery   can be invoked in all of the ways shown be- low,  but  it  always  returns  a  jQuery  object  that  represents  a collection  of  document  elements   or  the  Document  object  113   itself . The symbol $ is an alias for jQuery, and you can use $   instead of jQuery   in each of the forms below:  jQuery sel [, context=document]   Returns a new jQuery object that represents the document elements that are descendants of context and match the selector string sel.  jQuery elts   Returns a new jQuery object that represents the specified elements. elts may be a single document element or an array or array-like object  such as a NodeList or another jQuery object  of document elements.  jQuery html, [props]   Parses html as a string of HTML-formatted text, and re- turns a new jQuery object that contains one or more top- level  elements  in  the  string.  If  html  describes  a  single HTML tag, props may be an object that specifies HTML attributes  and  event  handlers  for  the  newly  created element.  jQuery f   Registers f as a function to be invoked when the document has loaded and is ready to be manipulated. If the docu- ment  is  already  ready,  f  is  invoked  immediately  as  a method of the document object. Returns a jQuery object that contains only the document object.  Selector Grammar The jQuery selector grammar is very similar to that of CSS3, and it is explained in detail in “jQuery Selectors” on page 89. The following is a summary:  Simple tag, class, and id selectors  *            tagname       .classname     id  Selector combinations  A B    B as a descendant of A A > B  B as a child of A  114  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   A + B  B as a sibling following A A ~ B  B as a sibling of A  Attribute filters  [attr]       has attribute [attr=val]   has attribute with value val [attr!=val]  does not have attribute with value val [attr^=val]  attribute begins with val [attr$=val]  attribute ends with val [attr*=val]  attribute includes val [attr~=val]  attribute includes val as a word [attr=val]  attribute begins with val and optional hyphen  Element type filters  :button      :header       :password      :submit :checkbox    :image        :radio         :text :file        :input        :reset  Element state filters  :animated    :disabled     :hidden        :visible :checked     :enabled      :selected  Selection position filters  :eq n        :first        :last          :nth n  :even        :gt n         :lt n          :odd  Document position filters  :first-child               :nth-child n  :last-child                :nth-child even  :only-child                :nth-child odd                             :nth-child xn+y   Miscellaneous filters  :contains text             :not selector  :empty                     :parent :has selector   Basic Methods and Properties These are the basic methods and properties of jQuery objects. They don’t alter the selection or the selected elements in any way, but they allow you to query and iterate over the set of  Basic Methods and Properties   115   selected  elements.  See  the  section  “Queries  and  Query  Re- sults” on page 8 for details.  context  The context, or root element, under which the selection was  made.  This  is  the  second  argument  to  $    or  the Document object.  each f idx,elt    Invokes f once as a method of each selected element. Stops iterating if the function returns false. Returns the jQuery object on which it was invoked.  Return the selected element at the specified index in the jQuery  object.  You  can  also  use  regular  square  bracket array indexing. With no arguments, get   is a synonym for toArray  .  get idx :elt get  :array  index  :int index sel :int index elt :int  With no argument, return the index of the first selected element among its siblings. With a selector argument, re- turn the index of the first selected element within the set of elements that match the selector sel, or -1 if it is not found.  With  an  element  argument,  return  the  index  of elt in the selected elements, or -1 if it is not found.  is sel :boolean  Returns true if at least one of the selected elements also matches sel.  length  The number of selected elements.  map f idx,elt  :jQuery  Invokes f once as a method of each selected element, and returns a new jQuery object that holds the returned val- ues,  with  null  and  undefined  values  omitted  and  array values flattened.  116  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   selector  size  :int  The selector string originally passed to $  .  Returns the value of the length property.  toArray  :array  Returns a true array of the selected elements.  Selection Methods The methods described in this section alter the set of selected elements by filtering them, adding new elements, or by using the selected elements as starting points for new selections. In jQuery 1.4 and later, jQuery selections are always sorted in document order and do not contain duplicates. See “Selection Methods” on page 95.  add sel, [context]  add elts  add html   andSelf    children [sel]   The arguments to add   are passed to $  , and the result- ing selection is merged with the current selection.  Adds  the  previously  selected  set  of  elements   from  the stack  to the selection.  Selects children of the selected elements. With no argu- ment,  selects  all  children.  With  a  selector,  selects  only matching children.  closest sel, [context]   Selects the closest ancestor of each selected element that matches sel and is a descendant of context. If context is omitted, the context property of the jQuery object is used.  contents    Selects all children of each selected element, including text nodes and comments.  Selection Methods   117   end    eq idx   Pops the internal stack, restoring the selection to the state it was in before the last selection-altering method.  Selects only the selected element with the specified index. In jQuery 1.4, negative indexes count from the end.  filter sel  filter elts  filter f idx :boolean   Filter the selection so it only includes elements that also match the selector sel, that are included in the array-like object elts, or for which the predicate f returns true when invoked as a method of the element.  Selects all descendants of any selected element that match sel. first    Selects only the first selected element.  find sel   has sel  has elt   Filter the selection to include only those selected elements that have a descendant that matches sel or that are an- cestors of elt.  Selects only the last selected element.  last    next [sel]   nextAll [sel]   nextUntil sel   Selects the next sibling of each selected element. If sel is specified, excludes those that do not match.  Selects all of the siblings following each selected element. If sel is specified, excludes those that do not match.  Selects the siblings following each selected element up to  but not including  the first sibling that matches sel.  118  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   not sel  not elts  not f idx :boolean   This is the opposite of filter  . It filters the selection to exclude  elements  that  match  sel,  that  are  included  in elts, or for which  f returns  true.  elts may be a single element or an array-like object of elements. f is invoked as a method of each selected element.  offsetParent    Selects  the  nearest  positioned  ancestor  of  each  selected element. parent [sel]   Selects the parent of each selected element. If sel is speci- fied, excludes any that do not match.  Selects  the  ancestors  of  each  selected  element.  If  sel  is specified, excludes any that do not match.  parents [sel]   parentsUntil sel   prev [sel]   prevAll [sel]   prevUntil sel   pushStack elts   Selects the ancestors of each selected element up to  but not including  the first one that matches sel.  Selects  the  previous  sibling  of  each  selected  element.  If sel is specified, excludes those that do not match.  Selects all of the siblings before each selected element. If sel is specified, excludes those that do not match.  Selects the siblings preceding each selected element up to  but not including  the first sibling that matches sel.  Pushes the current state of the selection so that it can be restored with end  , and then selects the elements in the elts array  or array-like object .  > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  Selection Methods   119   siblings [sel]   Selects the siblings of each selected element, excluding the element itself. If sel is specified, excludes any siblings that do not match.  slice startidx, [endidx]   Filters the selection to include only elements with an index greater than or equal to startidx, and less than  but not equal to  endidx. Negative indexes count backward from the end of the selection. If endidx is omitted, the length property is used.  Element Methods The methods described here query and set the HTML attrib- utes and CSS style properties of elements. Setter callback func- tions with an argument named current are passed the current value of whatever it is they are computing a new value for; see Chapter 2.  addClass names  addClass f idx,current :names   Add  the  specified  CSS  class  name   or  names   to  the class attribute of each selected element. Or, invoke f as a method  of  each  element  to  compute  the  class  name  or names to add.  attr name :value attr name, value  attr name, f idx,current :value  attr obj   With one string argument, return the value of the named attribute  for  the  first  selected  element.  With  two  argu- ments, set the named attribute of all selected elements to the specified value, or invoke f as a method of each ele- ment to compute a value. With a single object argument, use property names as attribute names, and property val- ues as attribute values or attribute computing functions.  120  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   css name :value css name, value  css name, f idx,current :value  css obj   Like attr  , but query or set CSS style attributes instead of HTML attributes.  data  :obj data key :value data key, value  data obj   With  no  arguments,  return  the  data  object  for  the  first selected element. With one string argument, return the value of the named property of that data object. With two arguments, set the named property of the data object of all selected elements to the specified value. With one ob- ject  argument,  replace  the  data  object  of  all  selected elements.  hasClass name :boolean  Returns  true  if  any  of  the  selected  elements  includes name in its class attribute.  height  :int height h  height f idx,current :int   Return the height  not including padding, border, or mar- gin  of the first selected element, or set the height of all selected elements to h or to the value computed by invok- ing f as a method of each element.  innerHeight  :int  innerWidth  :int  Returns  the  height  plus  padding  of  the  first  selected element.  Returns  the  width  plus  padding  of  the  first  selected element.  Element Methods   121   offset  :coords offset coords  offset f idx,current :coords   Return the X and Y position  in document coordinates  of the first selected element, or set the position of all selected elements to coords or to the value computed by invoking f as a method of each element. Coordinates are specified as objects with top and left properties.  offsetParent  :jQuery  Selects  the  nearest  positioned  ancestor  of  each  selected element and returns them in a new jQuery object.  outerHeight [margins=false] :int  Returns the height plus the padding and border, and, if margins is true, the margins of the first selected element.  outerWidth [margins=false] :int  Returns the width plus the padding and border, and, if margins is true, the margins of the first selected element.  position  :coords  Returns the position of the first selected element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. The return value is an object with top and left properties.  removeAttr name   Removes the named attribute from all selected elements.  removeClass names  removeClass f idx,current :names   Remove the specified name  or names  from the class at- tribute of all selected elements. If a function is passed in- stead of a string, invoke it as a method of each element to compute the name to be removed.  removeData [key]   Removes the named property from the data object of each selected  element.  If  no  property  name  is  specified,  re- moves the entire data object instead.  122  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   scrollLeft  :int scrollLeft int   scrollTop  :int scrollTop int   Return the horizontal scrollbar position of the first selec- ted element or set it for all selected elements.  Return the vertical scrollbar position of the first selected element or set it for all selected elements.  toggleClass names, [add]  toggleClass f idx,current :names, [add]   Toggle the specified class name  or names  in the class property of each selected element. If f is specified, invoke it as a method of each selected element to compute the name to be toggled. If add is true or false, add or remove the class names rather than toggling them.  val  :value val value  val f idx,current  :value  Return the form value or selection state of the first selected element, or set the value or selection state of all selected elements to value or to the value computed by invoking f as a method of each element.  width  :int width w  width f idx,current :int   Return the width  not including padding, border, or mar- gin  of the first selected element, or set the width of all selected elements to w or to the value computed by invok- ing f as a method of each element.  Insertion and Deletion Methods The methods described here insert, delete, and replace docu- ment  content.  In  the  method  signatures  below,  the  content argument may be a jQuery object, a string of HTML, or an individual document element, and the target argument may  Insertion and Deletion Methods   123   be  a  jQuery  object,  an  individual  document  element,  or  a selector  string.  See  “Getting  and  Setting  Element  Con- tent” on page 18 and Chapter 3 for further details.  after content  after f idx :content   Insert content after each selected element, or invoke f as a  method  of—and  insert  its  return  value  after—each selected element.  append content  append f idx,html :content   Append content to each selected element, or invoke f as a  method  of—and  append  its  return  value  to—each selected element.  appendTo target :jQuery  Appends the selected elements to the end of each specified target element, cloning them as necessary if there is more than one target.  before content  before f idx :content   Like  after  ,  but  make  insertions  before  the  selected elements.  clone [data=false] :jQuery  Makes a deep copy of each of the selected elements and returns a new jQuery object representing the cloned ele- ments. If data is true, also clones the data  including event handlers  associated with the selected elements.  detach [sel]   empty    Like  remove  ,  but  does  not  delete  any  data  associated with the detached elements.  Deletes the content of all selected elements.  html  :string html htmlText  html f idx,current :htmlText   With no arguments, return the content of the first selected element  as  an  HTML-formatted  string.  With  one  124  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   argument, set the content of all selected elements to the specified htmlText or to the value returned by invoking f as a method of those elements.  insertAfter target :jQuery  Inserts the selected elements after each target element, cloning them as necessary if there is more than one target.  insertBefore target :jQuery  Inserts the selected elements before each target element, cloning them as necessary if there is more than one target.  prepend content  prepend f idx,html :content   Like append  , but insert content at the beginning of each selected element.  prependTo target :jQuery  Like appendTo  , except that the selected elements are in- serted at the beginning of the target elements.  remove [sel]   Removes  all  selected  elements,  or  all  selected  elements that also match sel, from the document, as well as any data   including  event  handlers   associated  with  them. Note that the removed elements are no longer part of the document, but are still members of the returned jQuery object.  replaceAll target   Inserts the selected elements into the document so that they  replace  each  target  element,  cloning  the  selected elements as needed if there is more than one target.  replaceWith content  replaceWith f idx,html :content   Replace each selected element with content, or invoke f as  a  method  of  each  selected  element—passing  the element  index  and  current  HTML  content—and  then replace that element with the return value.  > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  Insertion and Deletion Methods   125   text  :string text plainText  text f idx,current :plainText   With no arguments, return the content of the first selected element as a plain-text string. With one argument, set the content  of  all  selected  elements  to  the  specified  plain Text or to the value returned by invoking f as a method of those elements.  unwrap    Removes the parent of each selected element, replacing it with the selected element and its siblings.  wrap wrapper  wrap f idx :wrapper   Wrap wrapper around each selected element, cloning as needed  if  there  is  more  than  one  selected  element.  If  a function is passed, invoke it as a method of each selected element to compute the wrapper. The wrapper may be an element, a jQuery object, a selector, or a string of HTML, but it must have a single innermost element.  wrapAll wrapper   Wraps wrapper around the selected elements as a group by inserting wrapper at the location of the first selected element and then copying all selected elements into the innermost element of wrapper.  wrapInner wrapper  wrapInner f idx :wrapper   Like wrap  , but inserts wrapper  or the return value of f  around the content of each selected element rather than around the elements themselves.  Event Methods The methods in this section are for registering event handlers and triggering events; see Chapter 4.  126  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   event-type   event-type f event    Register f as a handler for event-type, or trigger an event of event-type. jQuery defines the following convenience methods that follow this pattern:  ajaxComplete blur     focusin  mousedown  mouseup ajaxError    change   focusout mouseenter resize ajaxSend     click    keydown  mouseleave scroll ajaxStart    dblclick keypress mousemove  select ajaxStop     error    keyup    mouseout   submit ajaxSuccess  focus    load     mouseover  unload  bind type, [data], f event   bind events   Register f as a handler for events of the specified type on each of the selected elements. If data is specified, add it to the event object before invoking f. type may specify mul- tiple event types and may include namespaces. If a single object is passed, treat it as a mapping of event types to handler functions, and register handlers for all the specified events on each selected element.  delegate sel, type, [data], f event    Registers f as a live event handler. f will be triggered when events of type type occur on an element matching sel and bubble up to any of the selected elements. If data is speci- fied, it will be added to the event object before f is invoked.  die type, [f event ]   Deregisters live event handlers registered with live   for events of type type on elements that match the selector string of the current selection. If a specific event handler function f is specified, only deregister that one.  hover f event   hover enter event , leave event    Register  event  handlers  for  “mouseenter”  and  “mouse- leave” events on all selected elements. If only one function is specified, it is used as the handler for both events.  Event Methods   127   live type, [data], f event    Registers f as a live event handler for events of type type. If data is specified, adds it to the event object before in- voking  f.  This  method  does  not  use  the  set  of  selected elements, but it does use the selector string and context object  of  the  jQuery  object.  f  will  be  triggered  when type events bubble up to the context object  usually the document  and the event’s target element matches the se- lector. See delegate  .  one type, [data], f event   one events   Like bind  , except that the registered event handlers are automatically deregistered after they are invoked once.  ready f     Registers f to be invoked when the document becomes ready, or invokes it immediately if the document is ready. This method does not use the selected elements and is a synonym for $ f .  toggle f1 event , f2 event ,...   Registers a “click” event handler on all selected elements that  alternate   or  toggle   among  the  specified  handler functions.  trigger type, [params]  trigger event   Trigger  a  type  event  on  all  selected  elements,  passing params as extra parameters to event handlers. params may be omitted, or may be a single value or an array of values. If you pass an event object, its type property specifies the event type, and any other properties are copied into the event object that is passed to the handlers.  triggerHandler type, [params]   Like trigger  , but does not allow the triggered event to bubble or to trigger the browser’s default action.  unbind [type],[f event ]   With no arguments, deregisters all jQuery event handlers on all selected elements. With one argument, deregisters  128  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   all event handlers for the type events on all selected ele- ments. With two arguments, deregisters f as a handler for type events on all selected elements. type may name mul- tiple event types and may include namespaces.  undelegate   undelegate sel, type, [f event ]   With no arguments, deregister all live event handlers dele- gated from the selected elements. With two arguments, deregister live event handlers for type events on elements matching  sel  that  are  delegated  from  the  selected  ele- ments. With three arguments, only deregister the single handler f.  Effects and Animation Methods The methods described here produce visual effects and custom animations. Most return the jQuery object on which they are called; see Chapter 5.  Animation options  jQuery.fx.off  animate props, opts   complete  duration  easing  queue  specialEasing step  Disables all effects and animations when set to true.  Animates the CSS properties specified by the props object on each selected element, using the options specified by opts. See “Custom Animations” on page 53 for details of both objects.  animate props, [duration], [easing], [f  ]   Animates the CSS properties specified by props on each selected  element,  using  the  specified  duration  and easing function. Invokes f as a method of each selected element when done. clearQueue [qname="fx"]   Clears the effects queue or the named queue for each se- lected element.  Effects and Animation Methods   129   delay duration, [qname="fx"]   Adds a delay of the specified duration to the effects queue or the named queue.  dequeue [qname="fx"]   Removes  and  invokes  the  next  function  on  the  effects queue or the named queue. It is not normally necessary to dequeue the effects queue. fadeIn [duration=400],[f  ]  fadeOut [duration=400],[f  ]   Fade the selected elements in or out by animating their opacity  for  duration  ms.  When  complete,  invoke  f,  if specified, as a method of each selected element.  fadeTo duration, opacity, [f  ]   Animates  the  CSS  opacity  of  the  selected  elements  to opacity over the specified duration. When complete, in- vokes f, if specified, as a method of each selected element.  hide   hide duration, [f  ]   With no arguments, hide each selected element immedi- ately. Otherwise, animate the size and opacity of each se- lected element so that they are hidden after duration ms. When complete, invoke f, if specified, as a method of each selected element.  slideDown [duration=400],[f  ]  slideUp [duration=400],[f  ]  slideToggle [duration=400],[f  ]   Show, hide, or toggle the visibility of each selected element by animating its height for the specified duration. When complete, invoke f, if specified, as a method of each se- lected element.  show   show duration, [f  ]   With no arguments, show each selected element imme- diately. Otherwise, animate the size and opacity of each selected  element  so  that  they  are  fully  visible  after  130  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   duration ms. When complete, invoke f, if specified, as a method of each selected element.  stop [clear=false], [jump=false]   Stops the current animation  if one is running  on all se- lected  elements.  If  clear  is  true,  also  clears  the  effects queue for each element. If jump is true, jumps the anima- tion to its final value before stopping it.  toggle [show]  toggle duration, [f  ]   If show is true, show   the selected elements immediately. If show is false, hide   the selected elements immediately. If show is omitted, toggle the visibility of the elements. If duration is specified, toggle the visibility of the selected elements with a size and opacity animation of the specified length. When complete, invoke f, if specified, as a method of each selected element.  queue [qname="fx"] :array queue [qname="fx"], f next   queue [qname="fx"], newq   With  no  arguments  or  just  a  queue  name,  return  the named queue of the first selected element. With a function argument, add f to the named queue of all selected ele- ments. With an array argument, replace the named queue of all selected elements with the newq array of functions.  Ajax Functions Most of the jQuery Ajax-related functionality takes the form of utility functions rather than methods. These are some of the most complicated functions in the jQuery library; see Chap- ter 6 for complete details.  Ajax status codes  Ajax Data Types  success  error  notmodified  timeout  parsererror  text   html   xml   script   json   jsonp  Ajax Functions   131   > m o c . k o o b e w o w w w w <   k o o B e   !  .     w o W m o r f   d a o n w o D  l  Ajax Events  Ajax Options  ajaxStart    ajaxSuccess     ajaxComplete  ajaxSend     ajaxError       ajaxStop   async       data       jsonp         timeout beforeSend  dataFilter jsonpCallback traditional cache       dataType   password      type complete    error      processData   url contentType global     scriptCharset username context     ifModified success       xhr  jQuery.ajax options :XHR  This is the complicated but fully general Ajax function on which all of jQuery’s Ajax utilities are based. It expects a single object argument whose properties specify all details of the Ajax request and the handling of the server’s re- sponse.  The  most  common  options  are  described  in “Common Options” on page 73, and callback options are covered in “Callbacks” on page 75.  jQuery.ajaxSetup options   Sets default values for jQuery’s Ajax options. Passes the same  kind  of  options  object  you  would  pass  to jQuery.ajax  . The values you specify will be used by any subsequent Ajax request that does not specify the value itself. This function has no return value.  jQuery.getJSON url, [data], [f object,status ] :XHR  Asynchronously  requests  the  specified  url,  adding  any data that is specified. When the response is received, par- ses it as JSON, and passes the resulting object to the call- back function f. Returns the XMLHttpRequest object, if any, used for the request.  jQuery.getScript url, [f text,status ] :XHR  Asynchronously requests the specified url. When the re- sponse arrives, executes it as a script, and then passes the response text to f. Returns the XMLHttpRequest object, if any, used for the request. Cross-domains are allowed, but does not pass the script text to f, and does not return an XMLHttpRequest object.  132  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   jQuery.get url,[data],[f data,status,xhr ],[type] :XHR  Makes an asynchronous HTTP GET request for url, add- ing data, if any, to the query parameter portion of that URL. When the response arrives, interprets it as data of the  specified  type—or  according  to  the  Content-Type header  of  the  response—and  executes  it  or  parses  it  if necessary. Finally, passes the  possibly parsed  response data to the callback f along with the jQuery status code and  the  XMLHttpRequest  object  used  for  the  request. That XMLHttpRequest object, if any, is also the return value of jQuery.get  .  jQuery.post url,[data],[f data,status,xhr ],[type] :XHR  Like jQuery.get  , but makes an HTTP POST request in- stead of a GET request.  jQuery.param o, [old=false] :string  Serializes the names and values of the properties of o in www-form-urlencoded form, suitable for adding to a URL or passing as the body of an HTTP POST request. Most jQuery Ajax functions will do this automatically for you if you pass an object as the data parameter. Pass true as the second argument if you want jQuery 1.3-style shallow serialization.  jQuery.parseJSON text :object  Parses JSON-formatted text and returns the resulting ob- ject. jQuery’s Ajax functions use this function internally when you request JSON-encoded data.  load url, [data], [f text,status,xhr ]   Asynchronously requests the url, adding any data that is specified.  When  the  response  arrives,  interprets  it  as  a string of HTML and inserts it into each selected element, replacing  any  existing  content.  Finally,  invokes  f  as  a method  of  each  selected  element,  passing  the  response text, the jQuery status code, and the XMLHttpRequest object used for the request. If url includes a space, any text after the space is used as a selector, and only the portions of the response document  Ajax Functions   133   that  match  that  selector  are  inserted  into  the  selected elements. Unlike most jQuery Ajax utilities, load   is a method not a  function.  Like  most  jQuery  methods,  it  returns  the jQuery object on which it was invoked.  serialize  :string  Serializes the names and values of the selected forms and form elements, returning a string in www-form-urlencoded format.  Utility Functions These are miscellaneous jQuery functions and properties  not methods ; see Chapter 7 for more details.  jQuery.boxModel  jQuery.browser  A deprecated synonym for jQuery.support.boxModel.  This  property  refers  to  an  object  that  identifies  the browser vendor and version. The object has the property msie for Internet Explorer, mozilla for Firefox, webkit for Safari  and  Chrome,  and  opera  for  Opera.  The  version property is the browser version number.  jQuery.contains a,b :boolean  Returns true if document element a contains element b.  jQuery.data elt :data jQuery.data elt, key :value jQuery.data elt, data  jQuery.data elt, key, value   A low-level version of the data   method. With one ele- ment argument, return the data object for that element. With an element and a string, return the named value from that element’s data object. With an element and an object, set  the  data  object  for  the  element.  With  an  element, string, and value, set the named value in the element’s data object.  134  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   jQuery.dequeue elt, [qname="fx"]   Removes  and  invokes  the  first  function  in  the  named queue  of  the  specified  element.  It  is  the  same  as $ elt .dequeue qname .  jQuery.each o, f name,value  :o jQuery.each a, f index,value  :a  Invoke f once for each property of o, passing the name and value of the property and invoking f as a method of the value. If the first argument is an array or array-like object, invoke f as a method of each element in the array, passing the array index and element value as arguments. Iteration stops  if  f  returns  false.  This  function  returns  its  first argument.  jQuery.error msg   Throws  an  exception  containing  msg.  You  can  call  this function from plugins or override  e.g.,  jQuery.error = alert  it when debugging.  jQuery.extend obj :object jQuery.extend [deep=false], target, obj... :object  With one argument, copy the properties of obj into the global jQuery namespace. With two or more arguments, copy the properties of the second and subsequent objects, in order, into the target object. If the optional deep argu- ment is true, a deep copy is done and properties are copied recursively.  The  return  value  is  the  object  that  was extended.  jQuery.globalEval code :void  Executes the specified JavaScript code as if it were a top- level  . No return value.  jQuery.grep a, f elt,idx :boolean, [invert=false] :array Returns a new array that contains only the elements of a for which f returns true. Or, if invert is true, returns only those elements for which f returns false.  jQuery.inArray v, a :integer  Searches the array or array-like object a for an element v, and returns the index at which it is found or -1.  Utility Functions   135   jQuery.isArray x :boolean  Returns true only if x is a true JavaScript array.  jQuery.isEmptyObject x :boolean  Return strue only if x has no enumerable properties.  jQuery.isFunction x :boolean  Returns true only if x is a JavaScript function.  jQuery.isPlainObject x :boolean  Returns true only if x is a plain JavaScript object, such as one created by an object literal.  jQuery.isXMLDoc x :true  Returns true only if x is an XML document or an element of an XML document. jQuery.makeArray a :array  Returns a new JavaScript array that contains the same el- ements as the array-like object a.  jQuery.map a, f elt, idx  :array  Returns a new array that contains the values returned by f when invoked for each element in the array  or array-like object   a.  Returned  values  of  null  are  ignored,  and  re- turned arrays are flattened.  jQuery.merge a,b :array  Appends the elements of the array b to a, and returns a. The arguments may be array-like objects or true arrays.  jQuery.noConflict [radical=false]   Restores the symbol $ to its value before the jQuery library was loaded, and returns  jQuery. If  radical is  true, also restores the value of the jQuery symbol.  jQuery.proxy f, o :function jQuery.proxy o, name :function  Return a function that invokes f as a method of o, or a function that invokes o[name] as a method of o.  jQuery.queue elt, [qname="fx"], [f]   Queries or sets the named queue of elt, or adds a new function f to that queue; same as $ elt .queue qname, f .  136  Chapter 11: jQuery Quick Reference   jQuery.removeData elt, [name] :void  Removes  the  named  property  from  the  data  object  of elt, or removes the data object itself.  jQuery.support  An object containing a number of properties describing the features and bugs of the current browser. Most are of interest only to plugin writers. jQuery.support.boxModel is false in IE browsers running in quirks mode.  jQuery.trim s :string  Returns a copy of the string s, with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed off.
