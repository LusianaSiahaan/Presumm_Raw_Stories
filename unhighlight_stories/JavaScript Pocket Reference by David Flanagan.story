The over- whelming majority of modern websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers—on desktops, game consoles, tablets, and  smartphones—include  JavaScript  interpreters,  making JavaScript the most ubiquitous programming language in his- tory. JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages,  CSS  to  specify  the  presentation  of  those  pages,  and JavaScript to specify their behavior. Recently, with the advent of Node  http:  nodejs.org , JavaScript has also become an im- portant programming language for web servers.  This book is an excerpt from the more comprehensive Java- Script: The Definitive Guide. No material from the out-of-date second edition remains. I’m hopeful that some readers will find this shorter and denser book more useful than the larger and more  intimidating  volume  from  which  it  came.  This  pocket reference  follows  the  same  basic  outline  as  the  larger  book: Chapters 1 through 9 cover the core JavaScript language, start- ing with fundamental matters of language syntax—types, val- ues, variables, operators, statements—and moving on to cov- erage of JavaScript objects, arrays, functions and classes. These chapters cover the language itself, and are equally relevant to programmers  who  will  use  JavaScript  in  web  browsers  and programmers who will be using Node on the server-side.  vii   To be useful, every language must have a platform or standard library of functions for performing things like basic input and output. The core JavaScript language defines a minimal API for working with text, arrays, dates, and regular expressions but does not include any input or output functionality. Input and output   as  well  as  more  sophisticated  features,  such  as  net- working, storage, and graphics  are the responsibility of the “host environment” within which JavaScript is embedded. The most common host environment is a web browser. Chapters 1 through 9 cover the language’s minimal built-in API. Chap- ters 10 through 14 cover the web browser host environment and explain how to use “client-side JavaScript” to create dy- namic web pages and web applications.  The number of JavaScript APIs implemented by web browsers has grown explosively in recent years, and it is not possible to cover them all in a book of this size. Chapters 10 through 14 cover the most important and fundamental parts of client-side JavaScript: windows, documents, elements, styles, events, net- working and storage. Once you master these, it is easy to pick up additional client-side APIs, which you can read about in JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.  Or in Canvas Pocket Refer- ence and jQuery Pocket Reference, which are also excerpts from The Definitive Guide.   Although  the  Node  programming  environment  is  becoming more  and  more  important,  there  is  simply  not  room  in  this pocket reference to include any information about server-side JavaScript. You can learn more at http:  nodejs.org. Similarly, there  is  no  room  in  the  book  for  an  API  reference  section. Again, I refer you to JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, or to on- line JavaScript references such as the excellent Mozilla Devel- oper Network at http:  developer.mozilla.org .

Preface   ix    CHAPTER 1 Lexical Structure  JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set. Unicode is a superset of ASCII and Latin-1 and supports virtually every written language currently used on the planet.  JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that lan- guage keywords, variables, function names, and other identi- fiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.  The  while  keyword,  for  example,  must  be  typed “while,” not “While” or “WHILE.” Similarly, online, Online, OnLine, and ONLINE are four distinct variable names.  Comments JavaScript supports two styles of comments. Any text between a    and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript. Any text between the characters  * and *  is also treated as a comment; these comments may span multiple lines but may not be nested. The following lines of code are all legal JavaScript comments:     This is a single-line comment.  * This is also a comment *      And here is another.  *  * This is yet another comment.  * It has multiple lines.  *   1   Identifiers and Reserved Words An identifier is simply a name. In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables and functions and to provide labels for cer- tain loops in JavaScript code. A JavaScript identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore  _ , or a dollar sign  $ . Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.  JavaScript reserves a number of identifiers as the keywords of the language itself. You cannot use these words as identifiers in your programs:  break      delete     function   return     typeof case       do         if         switch     var catch      else       in         this       void continue   false      instanceof throw      while debugger   finally    new        true       with default    for        null       try  JavaScript also reserves certain keywords that are not currently used by the language but which might be used in future ver- sions. ECMAScript 5 reserves the following words:  class  const  enum  export  extends  import  super  In addition, the following words, which are legal in ordinary JavaScript code, are reserved in strict mode:  implements  let      private    public  yield interface   package  protected  static  Strict mode also imposes restrictions on the use of the follow- ing identifiers. They are not fully reserved, but they are not allowed as variable, function, or parameter names:  arguments   eval  ECMAScript 3 reserved all the keywords of the Java language, and  although  this  has  been  relaxed  in  ECMAScript  5,  you should still avoid all of these identifiers if you plan to run your code under an ECMAScript 3 implementation of JavaScript:  abstract   double     goto        native     static boolean    enum       implements  package    super byte       export     import      private    synchronized char       extends    int         protected  throws  2  Chapter 1: Lexical Structure   class      final      interface   public     transient const      float      long        short      volatile  Optional Semicolons Like many programming languages, JavaScript uses the semi- colon   ;   to  separate  statements   see  Chapter  4   from  each other.  This  is  important  to  make  the  meaning  of  your  code clear: without a separator, the end of one statement might ap- pear to be the beginning of the next, or vice versa. In JavaScript, you can usually omit the semicolon between two statements if those statements are written on separate lines.  You can also omit a semicolon at the end of a program or if the next token in  the  program  is  a  closing  curly  brace  }.   Many  JavaScript programmers  and the code in this book  use semicolons to explicitly mark the ends of statements, even where they are not required. Another style is to omit semicolons whenever possi- ble, using them only in the few situations that require them. Whichever style you choose, there are a few details you should understand about optional semicolons in JavaScript.  Consider the following code. Since the two statements appear on separate lines, the first semicolon could be omitted:  a = 3; b = 4;  a = 3; b = 4;  Written as follows, however, the first semicolon is required:  Note that JavaScript does not treat every line break as a semi- colon: it usually treats line breaks as semicolons only if it can’t parse the code without the semicolons. More formally, Java- Script interprets a line break as a semicolon if it appears after the return, break, or continue keywords, or before the ++ or -- operators, or if the next nonspace character cannot be in- terpreted as a continuation of the current statement.  Optional Semicolons   3   These statement termination rules lead to some surprising ca- ses.  This  code  looks  like  two  separate  statements  separated with a newline:  var y = x + f  a+b .toString    But the parentheses on the second line of code can be inter- preted  as  a  function  invocation  of  f  from  the  first  line,  and JavaScript interprets the code like this:  var y = x + f a+b .toString  ;  4  Chapter 1: Lexical Structure   CHAPTER 2 Types, Values, and Variables  Computer programs work by manipulating values, such as the number 3.14 or the text “Hello World.” The kinds of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as types. When a program needs to retain a value for future use, it assigns the value to  or “stores” the value in  a variable. A variable defines a symbolic name for a value and allows the value to be referred to by name.  JavaScript types can be divided into two categories: primitive types  and  object  types.  JavaScript’s  primitive  types  include numbers, strings of text  known as strings , and Boolean truth values  known as booleans . The first few sections of this chap- ter explain JavaScript’s primitive types.  Chapters 5, 6, and 7 describe three kinds of JavaScript object types.   JavaScript converts values liberally from one type to another. If a program expects a string, for example, and you give it a number, it will automatically convert the number to a string for you. If you use a nonboolean value where a boolean is ex- pected,  JavaScript  will  convert  accordingly.  “Type  Conver- sions” on page 15 describes JavaScript’s type conversions.  JavaScript variables are untyped: you can assign a value of any type to a variable, and you can later assign a value of a different type to the same variable. Variables are declared with the var keyword.  JavaScript  uses  lexical  scoping.  Variables  declared  5   outside of a function are global variables and are visible every- where  in  a  JavaScript  program.  Variables  declared  inside  a function  have  function  scope  and  are  visible  only  to  code that  appears  function.  “Variable  Declara- tion” on page 19 covers variables in more detail.  inside  that   Numbers Unlike many languages, JavaScript does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values. All numbers in  JavaScript  are  represented  as  floating-point  values.  Java- Script represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point for- mat  defined  by  the  IEEE  754  standard,  which  means  it  can represent numbers as large as ±1.7976931348623157 × 10308 and as small as ±5 × 10−324. The JavaScript number format allows you to exactly represent all  the  integers  between  −9007199254740992   −253   and 9007199254740992  253 , inclusive. If you use integer values larger than this, you may lose precision in the trailing digits. Note, however, that certain operations in JavaScript  such as array indexing and the bitwise operators described in Chap- ter 3  are performed with 32-bit integers.  When a number appears directly in a JavaScript program, it’s called a numeric literal. JavaScript supports numeric literals in several formats. Note that any numeric literal can be preceded by a minus sign  -  to make the number negative.  In a JavaScript program, a base-10 integer is written as a se- quence of digits. For example:  0 1024  In  addition  to  base-10  integer  literals,  JavaScript  recognizes hexadecimal   base-16   values.  A  hexadecimal  literal  begins with “0x” or “0X”, followed by a string of hexadecimal digits. A hexadecimal digit is one of the digits 0 through 9 or the letters  6  Chapter 2: Types, Values, and Variables   a  or A  through f  or F , which represent values 10 through 15. Here are examples of hexadecimal integer literals:  0xff     15*16 + 15 = 255  base 10  0xCAFE911  Floating-point literals can have a decimal point; they use the traditional syntax for real numbers. A real value is represented as the integral part of the number, followed by a decimal point and the fractional part of the number.  Floating-point literals may also be represented using exponen- tial notation: a real number followed by the letter e  or E , fol- lowed by an optional plus or minus sign, followed by an integer exponent. This notation represents the real number multiplied by 10 to the power of the exponent.  More succinctly, the syntax is:  [digits][.digits][ Ee [ +- ]digits]  For example:  3.14 6.02e23           6.02 × 1023 1.4738223E-32     1.4738223 × 10−32  JavaScript programs work with numbers using the arithmetic operators that the language provides. These include + for ad- dition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication,   for division, and  %  for  modulo   remainder  after  division .  Full  details  on these and other operators can be found in Chapter 3.  In addition to these basic arithmetic operators, JavaScript sup- ports more complex mathematical operations through a set of functions  and  constants  defined  as  properties  of  the  Math object:  Math.pow 2,53      => 9007199254740992: 2 to the power 53 Math.round .6      => 1.0: round to the nearest integer Math.ceil .6       => 1.0: round up to an integer Math.floor .6      => 0.0: round down to an integer Math.abs -5        => 5: absolute value Math.max x,y,z     Return the largest argument Math.min x,y,z     Return the smallest argument Math.random        Pseudo-random number 0 <= x < 1.0  Numbers   7   Math.PI            π Math.E             e: The base of the natural logarithm Math.sqrt 3        The square root of 3 Math.pow 3,1 3     The cube root of 3 Math.sin 0         Trig: also Math.cos, Math.atan, etc. Math.log 10        Natural logarithm of 10 Math.log 100  Math.LN10    Base 10 logarithm of 100 Math.log 512  Math.LN2     Base 2 logarithm of 512 Math.exp 3                 Math.E cubed  Arithmetic in JavaScript does not raise errors in cases of over- flow, underflow, or division by zero. When the result of a nu- meric operation is larger than the largest representable number  overflow ,  the  result  is  a  special  infinity  value,  which  Java- Script prints as Infinity. Similarly, when a negative value be- comes larger than the largest representable negative number, the result is negative infinity, printed as -Infinity. The infinite values behave as you would expect: adding, subtracting, mul- tiplying,  or  dividing  them  by  anything  results  in  an  infinite value  possibly with the sign reversed .  Division by zero is not an error in JavaScript: it simply returns infinity or negative infinity. There is one exception, however: zero divided by zero does not have a well-defined value, and the result of this operation is the special not-a-number value, printed as NaN. NaN also arises if you attempt to divide infinity by infinity, or take the square root of a negative number or use arithmetic operators with nonnumeric operands that cannot be converted to numbers.  JavaScript predefines global variables Infinity and NaN to hold the positive infinity and not-a-number value.  The not-a-number value has one unusual feature in JavaScript: it does not compare equal to any other value, including itself. This means that you can’t write x == NaN to determine whether the value of a variable x is NaN. Instead, you should write x != x.  That  expression  will  be  true  if,  and  only  if,  x  is  NaN.  The function isNaN   is similar. It returns true if its argument is NaN, or if that argument is a nonnumeric value such as a string or an object. The related function isFinite   returns true if its argument is a number other than NaN, Infinity, or -Infinity.  8  Chapter 2: Types, Values, and Variables   There are infinitely many real numbers, but only a finite num- ber of them  18437736874454810627, to be exact  can be rep- resented exactly by the JavaScript floating-point format. This means that when you’re working with real numbers in Java- Script, the representation of the number will often be an ap- proximation of the actual number and small rounding errors will occur.  Text A string is an immutable ordered sequence of 16-bit values, each  of  which  typically  represents  a  Unicode  character— strings are JavaScript’s type for representing text. The length of a string is the number of 16-bit values it contains. JavaScript’s strings  and its arrays  use zero-based indexing: the first 16-bit value is at position 0, the second at position 1 and so on. The  empty string is the string of length 0. JavaScript does not have a special type that represents a single element of a string. To represent a single 16-bit value, simply use a string that has a length of 1.  String Literals To include a string literally in a JavaScript program, simply enclose the characters of the string within a matched pair of single or double quotes  ' or " . Double-quote characters may be contained within strings delimited by single-quote charac- ters,  and  single-quote  characters  may  be  contained  within strings delimited by double quotes. Here are examples of string literals:  ""     The empty string: it has zero characters 'name="myform"' "Wouldn't you prefer O'Reilly's book?" "This string\nhas two lines" "π = 3.14"  The backslash character  \  has a special purpose in JavaScript strings.  Combined  with  the  character  that  follows  it,  it  Text   9   represents  a  character  that  is  not  otherwise  representable within the string. For example, \n is an escape sequence that represents a newline character.  Another example is the \' escape, which represents the single quote  or apostrophe  character. This escape sequence is useful when you need to include an apostrophe in a string literal that is contained within single quotes. You can see why these are called escape sequences: the backslash allows you to escape from the usual interpretation of the single-quote character. In- stead of using it to mark the end of the string, you use it as an apostrophe:  'You\'re right, it can\'t be a quote'  Table 2-1 lists the JavaScript escape sequences and the char- acters they represent. Two escape sequences are generic and can be used to represent any character by specifying its Latin-1 or Unicode character code as a hexadecimal number. For ex- ample,  the  sequence  \xA9  represents  the  copyright  symbol, which has the Latin-1 encoding given by the hexadecimal num- ber A9. Similarly, the \u escape represents an arbitrary Unicode character specified by four hexadecimal digits; \u03c0 repre- sents the character π, for example. Table 2-1. JavaScript escape sequences  Sequence  \0  \b  \t  \n  \v  \f  \r  \"  \'  \\  Character represented The NUL character  \u0000  Backspace  \u0008  Horizontal tab  \u0009  Newline  \u000A  Vertical tab  \u000B  Form feed  \u000C  Carriage return  \u000D  Double quote  \u0022  Apostrophe or single quote  \u0027  Backslash  \u005C   10  Chapter 2: Types, Values, and Variables   Sequence \x XX \u XXXX  Character represented The Latin-1 character specified by the two hexadecimal digits XX The Unicode character specified by the four hexadecimal digits XXXX  If  the  \  character  precedes  any  character  other  than  those shown in Table 2-1, the backslash is simply ignored  although future versions of the language may, of course, define new es- cape sequences . For example, \ is the same as . ECMAScript 5 allows a backslash before a line break to break a string literal across multiple lines.  One of the built-in features of JavaScript is the ability to con- catenate strings. If you use the + operator with numbers, it adds them. But if you use this operator on strings, it joins them by appending the second to the first. For example:  msg = "Hello, " + "world";      => "Hello, world"  To  determine  the  length  of  a  string—the  number  of  16-bit values it contains—use the length property of the string. De- termine the length of a string s like this:  s.length  In  addition  to  this  length  property,  there  are  a  number  of methods you can invoke on strings  as always, see the reference section for complete details :  var s = "hello, world"    Start with some text. s.charAt 0                => "h": the first character. s.charAt s.length-1       => "d": the last character. s.substring 1,4           => "ell": chars 2, 3, and 4 s.slice 1,4               => "ell": same thing s.slice -3                => "rld": last 3 characters s.indexOf "l"             => 2: position of first l. s.lastIndexOf "l"         => 10: position of last l. s.indexOf "l", 3          => 3: position at or after 3 s.split ", "              => ["hello", "world"] s.replace "h", "H"        => "Hello, world":                               replaces all instances s.toUpperCase             => "HELLO, WORLD"  Text   11   Remember that strings are immutable in JavaScript. Methods like replace   and toUpperCase   return new strings: they do not modify the string on which they are invoked.  In ECMAScript 5, strings can be treated like read-only arrays, and you can access individual characters  16-bit values  from a string using square brackets instead of the charAt   method:  s = "hello, world"; s[0]                     => "h" s[s.length-1]            => "d"  Boolean Values A boolean value represents truth or falsehood, on or off, yes or no. There are only two possible values of this type. The re- served words true and false evaluate to these two values. Boolean  values  are  generally  the  result  of  comparisons  you make in your JavaScript programs. For example:  a == 4  This code tests to see whether the value of the variable a is equal to the number 4. If it is, the result of this comparison is the boolean value true. If a is not equal to 4, the result of the com- parison is false. Boolean values are commonly used in JavaScript control struc- tures. For example, the if else statement in JavaScript per- forms one action if a boolean value is true and another action if the value is false. You usually combine a comparison that creates a boolean value directly with a statement that uses it. The result looks like this:  if  a == 4    b = b + 1; else   a = a + 1;  This code checks whether a equals 4. If so, it adds 1 to b; other- wise, it adds 1 to a.  12  Chapter 2: Types, Values, and Variables   As we’ll discuss in “Type Conversions” on page 15, any Java- Script value can be converted to a boolean value. The following values convert to, and therefore work like, false:  undefined null 0 -0 NaN ""     the empty string  All other values, including all objects  and arrays  convert to, and work like, true. false, and the six values that convert to it, are sometimes called falsy values, and all other values are called truthy. Any time JavaScript expects a boolean value, a falsy value works like false and a truthy value works like true. As an example, suppose that the variable o either holds an ob- ject or the value null. You can test explicitly to see if o is non- null with an if statement like this:  if  o !== null  ...  The not-equal operator !== compares o to null and evaluates to either true or false. But you can omit the comparison and instead rely on the fact that null is falsy and objects are truthy:  if  o  ...  In the first case, the body of the if will be executed only if o is not null. The second case is less strict: it will execute the body of the if only if o is not false or any falsy value  such as null or undefined . Which if statement is appropriate for your pro- gram really depends on what values you expect to be assigned to o. If you need to distinguish null from 0 and "", then you should use an explicit comparison.  null and undefined null is a language keyword that evaluates to a special value that is usually used to indicate the absence of a value. Using the typeof operator on null returns the string “object,” indicating that  null  can  be  thought  of  as  a  special  object  value  that  null and undefined  13   indicates “no object.” In practice, however, null is typically regarded as the sole member of its own type, and it can be used to indicate “no value” for numbers and strings as well as ob- jects. Most programming languages have an equivalent to Java- Script’s null: you may be familiar with it as null or nil. JavaScript  also  has  a  second  value  that  indicates  absence  of value.  The  undefined  value  represents  a  deeper  kind  of  ab- sence. It is the value of variables that have not been initialized and the value you get when you query the value of an object property or array element that does not exist. The undefined value is also returned by functions that have no return value, and the value of function parameters for which no argument is supplied. undefined is a predefined global variable  not a lan- guage keyword like null  that is initialized to the undefined value. If you apply the typeof operator to the undefined value, it  returns  “undefined,”  indicating  that  this  value  is  the  sole member of a special type.  Despite these differences, null and undefined both indicate an absence of value and can often be used interchangeably. The equality operator == considers them to be equal.  Use the strict equality  operator  ===  to  distinguish  them.   Both  are  falsy values—they  behave  like  false  when  a  boolean  value  is  re- quired.  Neither  null  nor  undefined  have  any  properties  or methods. In fact, using . or [] to access a property or method of these values causes a TypeError.  The Global Object The sections above have explained JavaScript’s primitive types and values. Object types—objects, arrays, and functions—are covered in chapters of their own later in this book. But there is one very important object value that we must cover now. The global object is a regular JavaScript object that serves a very important purpose: the properties of this object are the globally defined  symbols  that  are  available  to  a  JavaScript  program. When  the  JavaScript  interpreter  starts   or  whenever  a  web  14  Chapter 2: Types, Values, and Variables   browser loads a new page , it creates a new global object and gives it an initial set of properties that define:    Global properties like undefined, Infinity, and NaN   Global  functions  like  isNaN  ,  parseInt     “Type  Con- versions” on page 15 , and eval    “Evaluation Expres- sions” on page 43 .    Constructor  functions  like  Date  ,  RegExp  ,  String  ,   Object  , and Array      Global objects like Math and JSON  “Serializing Proper-  ties and Objects” on page 84   The  initial  properties  of  the  global  object  are  not  reserved words, but they deserve to be treated as if they are. This chapter has already described some of these global properties. Most of the others will be covered elsewhere in this book.  In  top-level  code—JavaScript  code  that  is  not  part  of  a function—you can use the JavaScript keyword this to refer to the global object:  var global = this;     refer to the global object  In  client-side  JavaScript,  the  Window  object  serves  as  the global object. This global Window object has a self-referential  window property that can be used to refer to the global object. The Window object defines the core global properties, but it also defines quite a few other globals that are specific to web browsers and client-side JavaScript  see Chapter 10 .  When first created, the global object defines all of JavaScript’s predefined global values. But this special object also holds pro- gram-defined  globals  as  well.  If  your  code  declares  a  global variable, that variable is a property of the global object.  Type Conversions JavaScript is very flexible about the types of values it requires. We’ve  seen  this  for  booleans:  when  JavaScript  expects  a boolean  value,  you  may  supply  a  value  of  any  type,  and  Type Conversions   15   JavaScript will convert it as needed. Some values  “truthy” val- ues   convert  to  true  and  others   “falsy”  values   convert  to false. The same is true for other types: if JavaScript wants a string, it will convert whatever value you give it to a string. If JavaScript wants a number, it will try to convert the value you give it to a number  or to NaN if it cannot perform a meaningful conversion . Some examples:  10 + " objects"     => "10 objects". 10 -> string "7" * "4"           => 28: both strings -> numbers var n = 1 - "x";    => NaN: "x" can't convert to a number n + " objects"      => "NaN objects": NaN -> "NaN"  Table 2-2 summarizes how values convert from one type to another in JavaScript. Bold entries in the table highlight con- versions that you may find surprising. Empty cells indicate that no conversion is necessary and none is performed.  Table 2-2. JavaScript type conversions  Converted to: String  Number  undefined  "undefined"  NaN  Value  null  true  false ""  empty string  "1.2"  non- empty, numeric  "one"  non- empty, non- numeric   0  -0  NaN  "null"  "true"  "false"  "0"  "0"  "NaN"  0  1  0  0  1.2  NaN  Boolean  false  false  Object throws TypeError throws TypeError  Boolean true   Boolean false   false  String ""   true  String "1.2"   true  String "one"   Number 0   Number -0   Number NaN   false  false  false  true  Infinity  "Infinity"  Number Infinity   16  Chapter 2: Types, Values, and Variables   Number  Boolean  Object  Number -Infinity   Number 1   toString    toString   or valueOf    Converted to: String  "-Infinity"  "1"  ""  "9"  0  9  use join   method function source  NaN  NaN  Value  -Infinity 1  finite, non- zero  {}  any object  []  empty array   [9]  1 numeric elt  ['a']  any other array   function   {}  any function   true  true  true  true  true  true  true  Because JavaScript can convert values flexibly, its == equality operator is also flexible with its notion of equality. All of the following comparisons are true, for example:  null == undefined    These two are treated as equal. "0" == 0             String -> a number before comparing. 0 == false           Boolean -> number before comparing. "0" == false         Both operands -> 0 before comparing. Although  JavaScript  performs  many  type  conversions  auto- matically, you may sometimes need to perform an explicit con- version, or you may prefer to make the conversions explicit to keep your code clearer.  The simplest way to perform an explicit type conversion is to use the Boolean  , Number  , String  , or Object   functions:  Number "3"               => 3 String false             => "false" Or false.toString   Boolean []               => true Object 3                 => new Number 3   Type Conversions   17   Note  that  any  value  other  than  null  or  undefined  has  a toString   method and the result of this method is usually the same as that returned by the String   function. Certain  JavaScript  operators  perform  implicit  type  conver- sions, and are sometimes used for the purposes of type con- version. If one operand of the + operator is a string, it converts the  other  one  to  a  string.  The  unary  +  operator  converts  its operand to a number. And the unary ! operator converts its operand to a boolean and negates it. These facts lead to the following type conversion idioms that you may see in some code:  x + ""    Same as String x  +x        Same as Number x . Also x-0 !!x       Same as Boolean x . Note double !  Formatting and parsing numbers are common tasks in com- puter programs and JavaScript has specialized functions and methods that provide more precise control over number-to- string and string-to-number conversions.  The toString   method defined by the Number class accepts an optional argument that specifies a radix, or base, for the conversion. If you do not specify the argument, the conversion is done in base 10. However, you can also convert numbers in other bases  between 2 and 36 . For example:  var n = 17; binary_string = n.toString 2 ;         Evaluates to "10001" octal_string = "0" + n.toString 8 ;    Evaluates to "021" hex_string = "0x" + n.toString 16 ;    Evaluates to "0x11"  When working with financial or scientific data, you may want to convert numbers to strings in ways that give you control over the  number  of  decimal  places  or  the  number  of  significant digits in the output, or you may want to control whether ex- ponential  notation  is  used.  The  Number  class  defines  three methods for these kinds of number-to-string conversions:  var n = 123456.789; n.toFixed 2 ;            "123456.79" n.toExponential 3 ;      "1.235e+5" n.toPrecision 7 ;        "123456.8"  18  Chapter 2: Types, Values, and Variables   If you pass a string to the Number   conversion function, it at- tempts to parse that string as an integer or floating-point literal. That function only works for base-10 integers, and does not allow trailing characters that are not part of the literal. The parseInt   and parseFloat   functions  these are global func- tions, not methods of any class  are more flexible. parseInt   parses only integers, while parseFloat   parses both integers and  floating-point  numbers.  If  a  string  begins  with  “0x”  or “0X,” parseInt   interprets it as a hexadecimal number. Both parseInt   and parseFloat   skip leading whitespace, parse as many numeric characters as they can, and ignore anything that follows. If the first nonspace character is not part of a valid numeric literal, they return NaN:  parseInt "3 blind mice"         => 3 parseFloat " 3.14 meters"       => 3.14 parseInt "-12.34"               => -12 parseInt "0xFF"                 => 255 parseFloat "$72.47" ;           => NaN  parseInt   accepts an optional second argument specifying the radix  base  of the number to be parsed. Legal values are be- tween 2 and 36. For example:  parseInt "11", 2 ;              => 3  1*2 + 1  parseInt "077", 8 ;             => 63  7*8 + 7  parseInt "ff", 16 ;             => 255  15*16 + 15   Variable Declaration Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you should declare it. Variables are declared with the  var keyword, like this:  var i; var sum;  var i, sum;  You  can  also  declare  multiple  variables  with  the  same  var keyword:  Variable Declaration  19   And  you  can  combine  variable  declaration  with  variable initialization:  var message = "hello"; var i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;  If you don’t specify an initial value for a variable with the var statement, the variable is declared, but its value is undefined until your code stores a value into it.  Note that the var statement can also appear as part of the for and for in loops  introduced in Chapter 4 , allowing you to succinctly declare the loop variable as part of the loop syntax itself. For example:  for var i = 0; i < 10; i++  console.log i ; for var i = 0, j=10; i < 10; i++,j--  console.log i*j ; for var p in o  console.log p ;  If you’re used to statically typed languages such as C or Java, you  will  have  noticed  that  there  is  no  type  associated  with JavaScript’s  variable  declarations.  A  JavaScript  variable  can hold a value of any type. For example, it is perfectly legal in JavaScript to assign a number to a variable and then later assign a string to that variable:  var i = 10; i = "ten";  It is legal and harmless to declare a variable more than once with the var statement. If the repeated declaration has an ini- tializer, it acts as if it were simply an assignment statement.  If  you  attempt  to  read  the  value  of  an  undeclared  variable, JavaScript generates an error. In ECMAScript 5 strict mode  see “use strict” in Chapter 4 , it is also an error to assign a value to an undeclared variable. Historically, however, and in nonstrict mode, if you assign a value to an undeclared variable, Java- Script actually creates that variable as a property of the global object,  and  it  works  much  like  a  properly  declared  global variable. This means that you can get away with leaving your global variables undeclared. This is a bad habit and a source of bugs, however, and you should always declare your variables with var.  20  Chapter 2: Types, Values, and Variables   The scope of a variable is the region of your program source code in which it is defined. A global variable has global scope; it is defined everywhere in your JavaScript code. On the other hand,  variables  declared  within  a  function  are  defined  only within the body of the function. They are local variables and have local scope. Function parameters also count as local vari- ables and are defined only within the body of the function.  Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Although you can get away with not using the var statement when you write code in the global scope, you must always use var to declare local variables. Function definitions can be nested. Each function has its own local scope, so it is possible to have several nested layers of local scope.  In  some  C-like  programming  languages,  each  block  of  code within curly braces has its own scope, and variables are not visible outside of the block in which they are declared. This is called  block  scope,  and  JavaScript  does  not  have  it.  Instead, JavaScript uses function scope: variables are visible within the function in which they are defined and within any functions that are nested within that function.  JavaScript’s function scope means that all variables declared within a function are visible throughout the body of the func- tion. Curiously, this means that variables are even visible be- fore they are declared. This feature of JavaScript is informally known as hoisting: JavaScript code behaves as if all variable declarations in a function  but not any associated assignments  are “hoisted” to the top of the function.  Variable Declaration  21    CHAPTER 3 Expressions and Operators  An expression is a phrase of JavaScript that a JavaScript inter- preter can evaluate to produce a value. A constant embedded literally in your program is a very simple kind of expression. A variable  name  is  also  a  simple  expression  that  evaluates  to whatever value has been assigned to that variable. Complex expressions are built from simpler expressions. An array access expression, for example, consists of one expression that eval- uates to an array followed by an open square bracket, an ex- pression  that  evaluates  to  an  integer,  and  a  close  square bracket. This new, more complex expression evaluates to the value stored at the specified index of the specified array. Sim- ilarly, a function invocation expression consists of one expres- sion  that  evaluates  to  a  function  object  and  zero  or  more additional expressions that are used as the arguments to the function.  The most common way to build a complex expression out of simpler expressions is with an operator. An operator combines the values of its operands  usually two of them  in some way and evaluates to a new value. The multiplication operator * is a simple example. The expression x * y evaluates to the prod- uct of the values of the expressions x and y. For simplicity, we sometimes  say  that  an  operator  returns  a  value  rather  than “evaluates to” a value.  23   Expressions The simplest expressions, known as primary expressions, are those that stand alone—they do not include any simpler ex- pressions.  Primary  expressions  in  JavaScript  are  constant  or literal  values,  certain  language  keywords,  and  variable references.  Literals are constant values that are embedded directly in your program. They look like these:  1.23            A number literal "hello"         A string literal  pattern        A regular expression literal  Reserved words like true, false, null, and this are primary expressions.  Finally, the third type of primary expression is the bare variable reference:  i         Evaluates to the value of the variable i. sum       Evaluates to the value of the variable sum.  When any identifier appears by itself in a program, JavaScript assumes it is a variable and looks up its value. If no variable with  that  name  exists,  the  expression  evaluates  to  the  unde fined value. In the strict mode of ECMAScript 5, however, an attempt  to  evaluate  a  nonexistent  variable  throws  a ReferenceError instead.  Initializers Object and array initializers are expressions whose value is a newly created object or array. These initializer expressions are sometimes called “object literals” and “array literals.” Unlike true literals, however, they are not primary expressions, be- cause  they  include  a  number  of  subexpressions  that  specify property and element values.  An  array  initializer  is  a  comma-separated  list  of  expressions contained  within  square  brackets.  The  value  of  an  array  24  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   initializer is a newly created array. The elements of this new array  are  initialized  to  the  values  of  the  comma-separated expressions:  []           An empty array [1+2,3+4]    A 2-element array with elts 3 and 7.  The element expressions in an array initializer can themselves be array initializers, which means that these expressions can create nested arrays:  var matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]];  A single trailing comma is allowed after the last expression in an array initializer.  Object initializer expressions are like array initializer expres- sions, but the square brackets are replaced by curly braces, and each  subexpression  is  prefixed  with  a  property  name  and  a colon:  var p = { x:2, y:1 };    An object with 2 properties var q = {};              Empty object; no properties q.x = 2; q.y = 1;        Now q has the same props as p  Object literals can be nested. For example:  var rectangle = { upperLeft:  { x: 2, y: 2 },                   lowerRight: { x: 4, y: 5 } };  The expressions in object and array initializers are evaluated each time the object initializer is evaluated, and they need not have constant values: they can be arbitrary JavaScript expres- sions. Also, the property names in object literals may be quoted strings rather than identifiers  this is useful to specify property names  that  are  reserved  words  or  are  otherwise  not  legal identifiers :  var side = 1; var square = { "ul": { x: p.x, y: p.y },                'lr': { x: p.x + side, y: p.y + side}};  Expressions   25   Property Access A property access expression evaluates to the value of an object property or an array element. JavaScript defines two syntaxes for property access:  expression . identifier expression [ expression ]  The first style of property access is an expression followed by a period and an identifier. The expression specifies the object, and the identifier specifies the name of the desired property. The second style of property access follows the first expression  the object or array  with another expression in square brack- ets. This second expression specifies the name of the desired property or the index of the desired array element. Here are some concrete examples:  var o = {x:1,y:{z:3}};    Example object var a = [o,4,[5,6]];      An array that contains o o.x           => 1: property x of expression o o.y.z         => 3: property z of expression o.y o["x"]        => 1: property x of object o a[1]          => 4: element at index 1 of expression a a[2]["1"]     => 6: element at index 1 of expression a[2] a[0].x        => 1: property x of expression a[0]  The .identifier syntax is the simpler of the two property ac- cess  options,  but  notice  that  it  can  only  be  used  when  the property you want to access has a name that is a legal identifier, and when you know the name when you write the program. If the  property  name  is  a  reserved  word  or  includes  spaces  or punctuation characters, or when it is a number  for arrays , you must use the square bracket notation. Square brackets are also used when the property name is not static but is itself the result of a computation.  Function Definition A function definition expression defines a JavaScript function, and the value of such an expression is the newly defined func- tion. In a sense, a function definition expression is a “function  26  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   literal” in the same way that an object initializer is an “object literal.” A function definition expression typically consists of the keyword function followed by a comma-separated list of zero or more identifiers  the parameter names  in parentheses and  a  block  of  JavaScript  code   the  function  body   in  curly braces. For example:     This function returns the square of its argument var square = function x  { return x * x; }  Functions can also be defined using a function statement rather than a function expression. Complete details on function def- inition are in Chapter 7.  Invocation An invocation expression is JavaScript’s syntax for calling  or executing  a function or method. It starts with a function ex- pression that identifies the function to be called. The function expression  is  followed  by  an  open  parenthesis,  a  comma- separated list of zero or more argument expressions, and a close parenthesis. Some examples:  f 0                f is the function; 0 is the argument. Math.max x,y,z     Function Math.max; arguments x, y & z. a.sort             Function a.sort; no arguments.  When an invocation expression is evaluated, the function ex- pression is evaluated first, and then the argument expressions are evaluated to produce a list of argument values. If the value of  the  function  expression  is  not  a  function,  a  TypeError  is thrown. Next, the argument values are assigned, in order, to the parameter names specified when the function was defined, and then the body of the function is executed. If the function uses a return statement to return a value, then that value be- comes the value of the invocation expression. Otherwise, the value of the invocation expression is undefined. Every invocation expression includes a pair of parentheses and an expression before the open parenthesis. If that expression is a property access expression, then the invocation is known as a method invocation. In method invocations, the object or  Expressions   27   array that is the subject of the property access becomes the value of the this parameter while the body of the function is being executed. This enables an object-oriented programming paradigm  in  which  functions   known  by  their  OO  name, “methods”  operate on the object of which they are part. See Chapter 8 for details.  Object Creation An object creation expression creates a new object and invokes a function  called a constructor  to initialize the properties of that object. Object creation expressions are like invocation ex- pressions except that they are prefixed with the keyword new:  If no arguments are passed to the constructor function in an object creation expression, the empty pair of parentheses can be omitted:  new Object   new Point 2,3   new Object new Date  When an object creation expression is evaluated, JavaScript first creates a new empty object, just like the one created by the  object initializer {}. Next, it invokes the specified function with the specified arguments, passing the new object as the value of the this keyword. The function can then use this to initialize the properties of the newly created object. Functions written for use as constructors do not return a value, and the value of the object creation expression is the newly created and initial- ized object. If a constructor does return an object value, that value becomes the value of the object creation expression and the newly created object is discarded.  Operators Operators  are  used  for  JavaScript’s  arithmetic  expressions, comparison  expressions,  logical  expressions,  assignment  28  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   expressions,  and  more.  Table  3-1  summarizes  JavaScript’s operators.  Table 3-1. JavaScript operators  Operator  ++  --  -  +  ~  !  delete  typeof  void *,  , % +, - +  <<  >>  >>>  , >=  , >= instanceof  in  ==  !=  ===  !==  &  ^  Operation Pre- or post-increment Pre- or post-decrement Negate number Convert to number Invert bits Invert boolean value Remove a property Determine type of operand Return undefined value Multiply, divide, remainder Add, subtract Concatenate strings Shift left Shift right with sign extension Shift right with zero extension Compare in numeric order Compare in alphabetic order Test object class Test whether property exists Test for equality Test for inequality Test for strict equality Test for strict inequality Compute bitwise AND Compute bitwise XOR  Types lval→num lval→num num→num num→num int→int bool→bool lval→bool any→str any→undef num,num→num num,num→num str,str→str int,int→int int,int→int int,int→int num,num→bool str,str→bool obj,func→bool str,obj→bool any,any→bool any,any→bool any,any→bool any,any→bool int,int→int int,int→int  Operators   29   Operator    &&    ?:  ,  = *=,  =, %=, +=, -=, &=, ^=, =,  >=, >>>=  Operation Compute bitwise OR Compute logical AND Compute logical OR Choose 2nd or 3rd operand Assign to a variable or property Operate and assign     Discard 1st operand, return 2nd  Types int,int→int any,any→any any,any→any bool,any,any→any lval,any→any lval,any→any     any,any→any  The operators listed in Table 3-1 are arranged in order from high precedence to low precedence, with horizontal lines sep- arating groups of operators at the same precedence level. Op- erator precedence controls the order in which operations are performed. Operators with higher precedence  nearer the top of the table  are performed before those with lower precedence  nearer to the bottom .  Consider the following expression:  w = x + y*z;  The multiplication operator * has a higher precedence than the addition operator +, so the multiplication is performed before the addition. Furthermore, the assignment operator = has the lowest precedence, so the assignment is performed after all the operations on the right side are completed.  Operator precedence can be overridden with the explicit use of parentheses. To force the addition in the previous example to be performed first, write:  w =  x + y *z;  Note  that  property  access  and  invocation  expressions  have higher  precedence  than  any  of  the  operators  listed  in  Ta- ble 3-1. Consider this expression:  30  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   typeof my.functions[x] y   Although typeof is one of the highest-priority operators, the typeof operation is performed on the result of the two property accesses and the function invocation.  In practice, if you are at all unsure about the precedence of your operators,  the  simplest  thing  to  do  is  to  use  parentheses  to make the evaluation order explicit. The rules that are impor- tant  to  know  are  these:  multiplication  and  division  are  per- formed before addition and subtraction, and assignment has very low precedence and is almost always performed last.  Some operators work on values of any type, but most expect their operands to be of a specific type, and most operators re- turn  or evaluate to  a value of a specific type. The Types col- umn in Table 3-1 specifies operand types  before the arrow  and result type  after the arrow  for the operators. The number of types before the arrow indicates the arity of the operator:  unary operators have one operand, binary operators have two, and the ternary ?: operator has three. Some operators behave differently depending on the type of the operands used with them. Most notably, the  + operator adds numeric operands but concatenates string operands. Sim- ilarly, the comparison operators such as < perform comparison in numerical or alphabetical order depending on the type of the operands.  Notice that the assignment operators and a few of the other operators listed in Table 3-1 expect an operand of type lval. This is an abbreviation for lvalue: a historical term that means “an expression that can legally appear on the left side of an assignment expression.” In JavaScript, variables, properties of objects, and elements of arrays are lvalues.  Evaluating a simple expression like 2 * 3 never affects the state of your program, and any future computation your program performs will be unaffected by that evaluation. Some expres- sions, however, have side effects, and their evaluation may af- fect the result of future evaluations. The assignment operators  Operators   31   are the most obvious example: if you assign a value to a variable or property, that changes the value of any expression that uses that variable or property. The ++ and -- increment and decre- ment operators are similar, since they perform an implicit as- signment. The delete operator also has side effects: deleting a property is like  but not the same as  assigning undefined to the property.  Arithmetic Operators This section covers the operators that perform arithmetic or other numerical manipulations on their operands.  Multiplication  *   Division      Computes the product of its two operands.  The   operator divides its first operand by its second. If you are used to programming languages that distinguish between integer and floating-point numbers, you might expect to get an integer result when you divide one integer by  another.  In  JavaScript,  however,  all  numbers  are floating-point,  so  all  division  operations  have  floating- point results: 5 2 evaluates to 2.5, not 2. Division by zero yields positive or negative infinity, and 0 0 evaluates to NaN: neither of these cases raises an error.  Modulo  %   The  %  operator  computes  the  first  operand  modulo  the second operand. In other words, it returns the remainder after whole-number division of the first operand by the second operand. The sign of the result is the same as the sign of the first operand. For example, 5 % 2 evaluates to 1 and -5 % 2 evaluates to -1. This operator is typically used with integer operands, but it also works for floating-point values. For example, 6.5 % 2.1 evaluates to 0.2.  Addition  +   The binary + operator adds numeric operands or concat- enates string operands:  32  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   1 + 2                        => 3 "hello" + " " + "there"      => "hello there" "1" + "2"                    => "12" 1 + 2 + " blind mice";       => "3 blind mice" 1 +  2 + " blind mice" ;     => "12 blind mice"  When the values of both operands are numbers, or are both strings, then it is obvious what the + operator does. In any other case, however, type conversion is necessary, and the operation to be performed depends on the con- version performed. The conversion rules for + give priority to string concatenation: if either of the operands is a string or an object that converts to a string, the other operand is converted to a string and concatenation is performed. Ad- dition is performed only if neither operand is string-like.  Subtraction  -   Subtracts the value of the right-hand operand from the value of the left-hand operand.  In addition to the binary operators listed above, JavaScript also defines some unary operators for arithmetic. Unary operators modify the value of a single operand to produce a new value:  Unary plus  +   The unary plus operator converts its operand to a number  or to NaN  and returns that converted value. When used with an operand that is already a number, it doesn’t do anything.  Unary minus  -   Increment  ++   When - is used as a unary operator, it converts its operand to a number, if necessary, and then changes the sign of the result.  The  ++  operator  increments   i.e.,  adds  1  to   its  single operand, which must be an lvalue  a variable, an element of an array, or a property of an object . The operator con- verts its operand to a number, adds 1 to that number, and assigns the incremented value back into the variable, ele- ment, or property.  Arithmetic Operators   33   The return value of the ++ operator depends on its position relative to the operand. When used before the operand, where it is known as the pre-increment operator, it incre- ments the operand and evaluates to the incremented value of that operand. When used after the operand, where it is known as the post-increment operator, it increments its operand but evaluates to the unincremented value of that operand. Consider the difference between these two lines of code:  var i = 1, j = ++i;       i and j are both 2 var i = 1, j = i++;       i is 2, j is 1  This operator, in both its pre- and post-increment forms, is most commonly used to increment a counter that con- trols a for loop  “for” on page 61 .  Decrement  --   The -- operator expects an lvalue operand. It converts the value of the operand to a number, subtracts 1, and assigns the decremented value back to the operand. Like the ++ operator, the return value of -- depends on its position relative to the operand. When used before the operand, it decrements  and  returns  the  decremented  value.  When used after the operand, it decrements the operand but re- turns the undecremented value.  The bitwise operators perform low-level manipulation of the bits in the binary representation of numbers. These operators are not commonly used in JavaScript programming, and if you are not familiar with the binary representation of decimal in- tegers, you can probably skip this section. The bitwise opera- tors expect integer operands and behave as if those values were represented as 32-bit integers rather than 64-bit floating-point values. These operators convert their operands to numbers, if necessary, and then coerce the numeric values to 32-bit inte- gers by dropping any fractional part and any bits beyond the 32nd. The shift operators require a right-side operand between 0 and 31.  34  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   Bitwise AND  &   The  &  operator  performs  a  Boolean  AND  operation  on each bit of its integer arguments. A bit is set in the result only if the corresponding bit is set in both operands. For example, 0x1234 & 0x00FF evaluates to 0x0034.  Bitwise OR     The  operator performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. A bit is set in the result if the corresponding bit is set in one or both of the operands. For example, 0x1234  0x00FF evaluates to 0x12FF.  Bitwise XOR  ^   The ^ operator performs a Boolean exclusive OR opera- tion on each bit of its integer arguments. Exclusive OR means that either operand one is true or operand two is true, but not both. A bit is set in this operation’s result if a corresponding bit is set in one  but not both  of the two operands.  For  example,  0xFF00  ^  0xF0F0  evaluates  to 0x0FF0.  Bitwise NOT  ~   The ~ operator is a unary operator that appears before its single integer operand. It operates by reversing all bits in the operand. Because of the way signed integers are rep- resented in JavaScript, applying the ~ operator to a value is equivalent to changing its sign and subtracting 1. For example, ~0x0F evaluates to 0xFFFFFFF0, or −16.  Shift left  <<   The << operator moves all bits in its first operand to the left  by  the  number  of  places  specified  in  the  second operand. For example, in the operation a << 1, the first bit  the ones bit  of a becomes the second bit  the twos bit , the second bit of a becomes the third, etc. A zero is used for the new first bit, and the value of the 32nd bit is lost. Shifting a value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying by 2, shifting two positions is equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on. For example, 7 << 2 evaluates to 28.  Arithmetic Operators   35   Shift right with sign  >>   The >> operator moves all bits in its first operand to the right  by  the  number  of  places  specified  in  the  second operand  an integer between 0 and 31 . Bits that are shif- ted off the right are lost. The bits filled in on the left depend on the sign bit of the original operand, in order to preserve the sign of the result. If the first operand is positive, the result has zeros placed in the high bits; if the first operand is  negative,  the  result  has  ones  placed  in  the  high  bits. Shifting a value right one place is equivalent to dividing by 2  discarding the remainder , shifting right two places is equivalent to integer division by 4, and so on. For ex- ample, 7 >> 1 evaluates to 3, and −7 >> 1 evaluates to −4.  Shift right with zero fill  >>>   The >>> operator is just like the >> operator, except that the bits shifted in on the left are always zero, regardless of the sign of the first operand. For example, −1 >> 4 evalu- ates to −1, but −1 >>> 4 evaluates to 0x0FFFFFFF.  Relational Operators JavaScript’s relational operators test for a relationship  such as “equals,” “less than,” or “property of”  between two values and return true or false depending on whether that relation- ship exists. Relational expressions always evaluate to a boolean value, and that value is often used to control the flow of pro- gram  execution  in  if,  while,  and  for  statements   see Chapter 4 .  JavaScript supports =, ==, and === operators. Be sure you un- derstand the differences between these assignment, equality, and strict equality operators, and be careful to use the correct one  when  coding!  Although  it  is  tempting  to  read  all  three operators “equals,” it may help to reduce confusion if you read “gets or is assigned” for =, “is equal to” for ==, and “is strictly equal to” for ===.  36  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   Strict equality  ===   The === operator is known as the strict equality operator  or  sometimes  the  identity  operator ,  and  it  checks whether  its  two  operands  are  “identical”  using  a  strict definition of sameness that does not include any type con- version  of  the  operands.  If  the  operands  have  different types, they are not equal. If both operands are primitive types and their values are the same, they are equal. If both operands refer to the same object, array, or function, they are  equal.  If  they  refer  to  different  objects  they  are  not equal, even if both objects have identical properties. Sim- ilarly, two arrays that have the same elements in the same order are not equal to each other. The only quirk in the behavior  of  this  operator  is  that  it  considers  the  not-a- number value NaN to be not equal to any other value, in- cluding itself!  Strict inequality  !==   The !== operator is the exact opposite of the === operator: it returns false if two values are strictly equal to each other and returns true otherwise.  Loose equality  ==   The == operator  with two equals signs instead of three  is like the strict equality operator, but it is less strict. If the values of the two operands are not the same type, it at- tempts some type conversions and tries the comparison again. This operator considers null and undefined to be equal, and this is often a helpful type conversion. But other conversions performed by == are more surprising. The fol- lowing comparisons all evaluate to true:  1 == "1" true == 1 "1" == true false == 0 [] == 0  Relational Operators   37   Loose inequality  !=   The != operator is the exact opposite of the == operator: it returns false if two values are loosely equal to each other and returns true otherwise.  The comparison operators test the relative order  numerical or alphabetical   of  their  two  operands.  Operands  that  are  not numbers or strings are converted to numbers or strings. These operators treat strings as sequences of 16-bit integer values, and that string comparison is just a numerical comparison of the  values  in  the  two  strings.  Note  in  particular  that  string comparison is case-sensitive, and all capital ASCII letters are “less  than”  all  lowercase  ASCII  letters.  This  rule  can  cause confusing results if you do not expect it. For example, accord- ing to the < operator, the string “Zoo” comes before the string “aardvark”:  Less than  <   Greater than  >   The < operator evaluates to true if its first operand is less than its second operand; otherwise it evaluates to false.  The  >  operator  evaluates  to  true  if  its  first  operand  is greater than its second operand; otherwise it evaluates to false.  Less than or equal  <=   The <= operator evaluates to true if its first operand is less than or equal to its second operand; otherwise it evaluates to false.  Greater than or equal  >=   The  >=  operator  evaluates  to  true  if  its  first  operand  is greater than or equal to its second operand; otherwise it evaluates to false.  The final two relational operators are in and instanceof: Property existence  in   The in operator expects a left-side operand that is or can be converted to a string. It expects a right-side operand that is an object. It evaluates to true if the left-side value  38  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   is  the  name  of  a  property  of  the  right-side  object.  For example:  var p = { x:1, y:1 }; "x" in p     => true: p has a property named "x". "z" in p     => false: p has no "z" property. "toString" in p    => true: p inherits toString.  var a = [7,8,9]; "0" in a     => true: a has an element "0" 1 in a       => true: numbers are converted  Object type  instanceof   The instanceof operator expects a left-side operand that is an object and a right-side operand that identifies a class of objects. The operator evaluates to true if the left-side object is an instance of the right-side class and evaluates to false otherwise. Chapter 8 explains that, in JavaScript, classes of objects are defined by the constructor function that  initializes  them.  Thus,  the  right-side  operand  of instanceof should be a function. Here are examples:  var d = new Date  ; d instanceof Date;      => true d instanceof Object;    => true d instanceof Number;    => false var a = [1, 2, 3];  a instanceof Array;     => true a instanceof Object;    => true  Logical Expressions The logical operators &&, , and ! perform Boolean algebra and are often used in conjunction with the relational operators to combine two relational expressions into one more complex expression. In order to fully understand them, remember that null, undefined, 0, "", and NaN are all “falsy” values that work like the boolean value false. All other values, including all ob- jects and arrays, are “truthy” and work like true. The && operator can be understood at three different levels. At the  simplest  level,  when  used  with  boolean  operands,  &&  Logical Expressions   39   performs the Boolean AND operation on the two values: it re- turns true if and only if both its first operand and its second operand are true. If one or both of these operands is false, it returns false. &&  is  often  used  as  a  conjunction  to  join  two  relational expressions:     true if  and only if  x and y are both 0 x == 0 && y == 0  Relational  expressions  always  evaluate  to  true  or  false,  so when  used  like  this,  the  &&  operator  itself  returns  true  or false.  Relational  operators  have  higher  precedence  than  &&  and  , so expressions like these can safely be written without parentheses.  But && does not require that its operands be boolean values. The second level at which && can be understood is as a Boolean AND operator for truthy and falsy values. If both operands are truthy, the operator returns a truthy value. Otherwise, one or both operands must be falsy, and the operator returns a falsy value. In JavaScript, any expression or statement that expects a boolean value will work with a truthy or falsy value, so the fact that && does not always evaluate to true or false does not cause practical problems.  Notice that the description above says that the operator returns “a truthy value” or “a falsy value,” but does not specify what that value is. For that, we need to describe && at the third and final level. This operator starts by evaluating its first operand, the expression on its left. If the value on the left is falsy, the value of the entire expression must also be falsy, so && simply returns the value on the left and does not even evaluate the expression on the right.  On the other hand, if the value on the left is truthy, then the overall value of the expression depends on the value on the right-hand  side.  If  the  value  on  the  right  is  truthy,  then  the overall value must be truthy, and if the value on the right is falsy, then the overall value must be falsy. So when the value  40  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   on the left is truthy, the && operator evaluates and returns the value on the right:  var o = { x : 1 }; var p = null; o && o.x    => 1: o is truthy, so return o.x p && p.x    => null: p is falsy, so don't eval p.x  It is important to understand that && may or may not evaluate its right-side operand. In the code above, the variable p is set to null, and the expression p.x would, if evaluated, cause a TypeError. But the code uses && in an idiomatic way so that p.x is evaluated only if p is truthy—not null or undefined. The  operator performs the Boolean OR operation on its two operands. If one or both operands is truthy, it returns a truthy value. If both operands are falsy, it returns a falsy value.  Although  the    operator  is  most  often  used  simply  as  a Boolean OR operator, it, like the && operator, has more com- plex behavior. It starts by evaluating its first operand, the ex- pression on its left. If the value of this first operand is truthy, it returns that truthy value. Otherwise, it evaluates its second operand, the expression on its right, and returns the value of that expression.  An idiomatic usage of this operator is to select the first truthy value in a set of alternatives:     If max_width is defined, use that.  Otherwise look    for a value in the preferences object.  If that is    not defined use a hard-coded constant. var max = max_width  preferences.max_width  500;  This idiom is often used in function bodies to supply default values for parameters:     Copy the properties of o to p, and return p function copy o, p  {       If no object passed for p, use a new one    p = p  {};       function body goes here }  The ! operator is a unary operator; it is placed before a single operand.  Its  purpose  is  to  invert  the  boolean  value  of  its  Logical Expressions   41   operand. For example, if x is truthy, !x evaluates to false. If x is falsy, then !x is true. Since ! always evaluates to true or false, you can convert any value x to its equivalent boolean value by applying this operator twice: !!x. As a unary operator, ! has high precedence and binds tightly. If you want to invert the value of an expression like p && q, you need to use parentheses: ! p && q .  Assignment Expressions JavaScript uses the = operator to assign a value to a variable, object property, or array element. For example:  i = 0       Set the variable i to 0. o.x = 1     Set the property x of object o to 1.  The = operator expects its left-side operand to be an lvalue: a variable or object property or array element. It expects its right- side operand to be an arbitrary value of any type. The value of an assignment expression is the value of the right-side operand. As a side effect, the = operator assigns the value on the right to the variable or property on the left so that future references to the variable or property evaluate to the value.  The assignment operator has right-to-left associativity, which means that when multiple assignment operators appear in an expression, they are evaluated from right to left. Thus, you can write code like this to assign a single value to multiple variables:  i = j = k = 0;          Initialize 3 variables to 0  Besides the normal = assignment operator, JavaScript supports a number of other assignment operators that provide shortcuts by combining assignment with some other operation. For ex- ample, the += operator performs addition and assignment. The following expression: total += sales_tax  is equivalent to this one:  total = total + sales_tax  42  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   As you might expect, the += operator works for numbers or strings.  For  numeric  operands,  it  performs  addition  and  as- signment; for string operands, it performs concatenation and assignment.  Similar operators include -=, *=, &=, and so on.  Evaluation Expressions Like many interpreted languages, JavaScript has the ability to interpret strings of JavaScript source code, evaluating them to produce a value. JavaScript does this with the global function eval  :  eval "3+2"        => 5  Dynamic  evaluation  of  strings  of  source  code  is  a  powerful language feature that is almost never necessary in practice. If you  find  yourself  using  eval  ,  you  should  think  carefully about whether you really need to use it. Technically, eval   is a function, but it is covered here because in many ways it be- haves more like an operator.  eval   expects one argument. If you pass any value other than a string, it simply returns that value. If you pass a string, it attempts  to  parse  the  string  as  JavaScript  code,  throwing  a SyntaxError if it fails. If it successfully parses the string, then it evaluates the code and returns the value of the last expression or statement in the string, or undefined if the last expression or statement had no value. If the evaluated string throws an ex- ception, that exception propagates from the call to eval  . The key thing about eval    when invoked like this  is that it uses the variable environment of the code that calls it. That is, it looks up the values of variables and defines new variables and functions in the same way that local code does. If a function defines a local variable x and then calls eval "x" , it will obtain the value of the local variable. If it calls eval "x=1" , it changes the  value  of  the  local  variable.  And  if  the  function  calls  Evaluation Expressions   43   eval "var y = 3;" , it has declared a new local variable y. Sim- ilarly, a function can declare a local function with code like this:  eval "function f   { return x+1; }" ;  eval   has a very unusual restriction  which is required to en- able JavaScript interpreters to run efficiently : it only behaves the way described above when called with its original name “eval.” Since it is technically a function, we can assign it to another variable. And if we invoke it using that other variable, it  behaves  differently:  when  invoked  by  any  other  name, eval   evaluates the string as if it were top-level global code. The evaluated code can define new global variables or global functions, and it can set global variables, but it cannot use or modify any variables local to the calling function.  Before IE9, IE differs from other browsers: it does not do a global eval when eval   is invoked by a different name. IE does define a global function named execScript   that executes its string argument as if it were a top-level script. Unlike eval  , however, execScript   always returns null. ECMAScript 5 strict mode imposes further restrictions on the behavior  of  eval  .  When  eval    is  called  from  strict  mode code, or when the string of code to be evaluated itself begins with a “use strict” directive, then eval   does a local eval with a private variable environment. This means that in strict mode, evaluated code can query and set local variables, but it cannot define new variables or functions in the local scope. Further- more, strict mode makes  eval   even more operator-like by effectively making “eval” into a reserved word.  Miscellaneous Operators JavaScript supports a number of other miscellaneous opera- tors, described in the following sections.  44  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   The Conditional Operator  ?:  The conditional operator is the only ternary operator  three operands   in  JavaScript.  This  operator  is  sometimes  writ- ten  ?:,  although  it  does  not  appear  quite  that  way  in  code. Because this operator has three operands, the first goes before the ?, the second goes between the ? and the :, and the third goes after the :. It is used like this:  x > 0 ? x : -x    The absolute value of x  The operands of the conditional operator may be of any type. The first operand is evaluated and interpreted as a boolean. If the value of the first operand is truthy, then the second operand is evaluated, and its value is returned. Otherwise, if the first operand is falsy, then the third operand is evaluated and its value is returned. Only one of the second and third operands is evaluated, never both.  While you can achieve similar results using the if statement  “if”  on  page  56 ,  the  ?:  operator  often  provides  a  handy shortcut. Here is a typical usage, which checks to be sure that a property is defined  and has a meaningful, truthy value  and uses it if so, or provides a default value if not:  greeting = "hello " +  user.name ? user.name : "there" ;  The typeof Operator typeof  is  a  unary  operator  that  is  placed  before  its  single operand, which can be of any type. Its value is a string that specifies the type of the operand. The following table specifies the value of the typeof operator for any JavaScript value:  x  typeof x  undefined  "undefined"  null true or false any number or NaN  "object"  "boolean"  "number"  Miscellaneous Operators   45   x any string any function any nonfunction object  typeof x  "string"  "function"  "object"  You might use the typeof operator in an expression like this:   typeof value == "string"  ? "'" + value + "'" : value  The delete Operator delete is a unary operator that attempts to delete the object property or array element specified as its operand.  If you are a C++ programmer, note that the delete keyword in JavaScript is nothing like the delete keyword in C++.  Like the assign- ment, increment, and decrement operators, delete is typically used for its property deletion side effect, and not for the value it returns. Some examples:  var o = {x:1, y:2}, a = [1,2,3]; delete o.x;     Delete a property of o "x" in o        => false: the property does not exist delete a[2];    Delete the last element of the array 2 in a          => false: array element 2 doesn't exist  The void Operator void is a unary operator that appears before its single operand, which may be of any type. This operator is unusual and very infrequently used: it evaluates its operand, then discards the value and returns undefined. Since the operand value is dis- carded, using the void operator makes sense only if the operand has side effects.  The Comma Operator  ,  The comma operator is a binary operator whose operands may be of any type. It evaluates its left operand, evaluates its right operand, and then returns the value of the right operand. The  46  Chapter 3: Expressions and Operators   left-hand expression is always evaluated, but its value is dis- carded, which means that it only makes sense to use the comma operator when the left-hand expression has side effects. The only situation in which the comma operator is commonly used is with a for loop  “for” on page 61  that has multiple loop variables:     The first comma below is part of the syntax of the    var statement. The second comma is the comma operator:    it lets us squeeze 2 expressions  i++ and j--  into a    statement  the for loop  that expects 1. for var i=0,j=10; i < j; i++,j--      console.log i+j ;  Miscellaneous Operators   47    CHAPTER 4 Statements  Chapter 3 described expressions as JavaScript phrases. By that analogy,  statements  are  JavaScript  sentences  or  commands. Just as English sentences are terminated and separated from each other with periods, JavaScript statements are terminated with semicolons  “Optional Semicolons” on page 3 . Expres- sions are evaluated to produce a value, but statements are ex- ecuted to make something happen.  One way to “make something happen” is to evaluate an ex- pression  that  has  side  effects.  Expressions  with  side  effects, such as assignments and function invocations, can stand alone as statements, and when used this way they are known as ex- pression statements. A similar category of statements are the declaration  statements  that  declare  new  variables  and  define new functions.  JavaScript programs are nothing more than a sequence of state- ments to execute. By default, the JavaScript interpreter exe- cutes these statements one after another in the order they are written. Another way to “make something happen” is to alter this default order of execution, and JavaScript has a number of statements or control structures that do just this:    Conditionals are statements like if and switch that make the JavaScript interpreter execute or skip other statements depending on the value of an expression.  49     Loops are statements like while and for that execute other  statements repetitively.    Jumps are statements like break, return, and throw that cause  the  interpreter  to  jump  to  another  part  of  the program.  Table  4-1  summarizes  JavaScript  statement  syntax,  and  the sections that follow it describe each statement in more detail.  Table 4-1.

This  sort  of  statement  was  shown  in Chapter 3. Assignment statements are one major category of expression statements. For example:  greeting = "Hello " + name; i *= 3;  The increment and decrement operators, ++ and --, are related to assignment statements. These have the side effect of chang- ing  a  variable  value,  just  as  if  an  assignment  had  been performed:  counter++;  The delete operator has the important side effect of deleting an object property. Thus, it is almost always used as a state- ment, rather than as part of a larger expression:  Expression Statements   51   delete o.x;  Function calls are another major category of expression state- ments. For example: alert greeting ; window.close  ;  These client-side function calls are expressions, but they have side effects that affect the web browser and are used here as statements.  Compound and Empty Statements A statement block combines multiple statements into a single compound statement. A statement block is simply a sequence of statements enclosed within curly braces. Thus, the following lines act as a single statement and can be used anywhere that JavaScript expects a single statement:  {     x = Math.PI;     cx = Math.cos x ;     console.log "cos π  = " + cx ; }  Combining  statements  into  larger  statement  blocks  is  ex- tremely common in JavaScript programming. Just as expres- sions  often  contain  subexpressions,  many  JavaScript statements contain substatements. Formally, JavaScript syntax usually allows a single substatement. For example, the while loop syntax includes a single statement that serves as the body of the loop. Using a statement block, you can place any number of statements within this single allowed substatement.  A compound statement allows you to use multiple statements where JavaScript syntax expects a single statement. The empty statement is the opposite: it allows you to include no statements where one is expected.  52  Chapter 4: Statements   The empty statement looks like this:  ;  The JavaScript interpreter takes no action when it executes an empty statement. The empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body:     Initialize the elements of a to 0 for i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0   * empty * ;  Declaration Statements The var and function are declaration statements—they declare or  define  variables  and  functions.  These  statements  define identifiers  variable and function names  that can be used else- where in your program and assign values to those identifiers. Declaration statements don’t do much themselves, but by cre- ating  variables  and  functions  they,  in  an  important  sense, define the meaning of the other statements in your program.  var The var statement declares a variable or variables. Here’s the syntax:  var name_1 [ = value_1] [ ,..., name_n [= value_n]]  The var keyword is followed by a comma-separated list of vari- ables to declare; each variable in the list may optionally have an  initializer  expression  that  specifies  its  initial  value.  For example:  var i;                             One simple variable var j = 0;                         One var, one value var p, q;                          Two variables var greeting = "hello" + name;     A complex initializer var x = 2, y = x*x;                Second var uses first var x = 2,                         Multiple variables...     f = function x  { return x*x },    each on its      y = f x ;                          own line  Declaration Statements   53   If  a  var  statement  appears  within  the  body  of  a  function,  it defines local variables, scoped to that function. When var is used  in  top-level  code,  it  declares  global  variables,  visible throughout the JavaScript program.  If no initializer is specified for a variable with the var statement, the variable’s initial value is undefined. Note that the var statement can also appear as part of the for and for in loops:  for var i = 0; i < 10; i++  console.log i ; for var i = 0, j=10; i < 10; i++,j--  console.log i*j ; for var i in o  console.log i ;  function The function keyword is used to define functions. We saw it in  function  definition  expressions  in  “Function  Defini- tion” on page 26. It can also be used in statement form. Con- sider the following two functions:     Expression assigned to a variable var f = function x  { return x+1; }    The statement form includes the variable name function f x  { return x+1; }  A function declaration statement has the following syntax:  function funcname [arg1 [, arg2 [..., argn]]]  {       statements }  funcname  is  an  identifier  that  names  the  function  being  de- clared. The function name is followed by a comma-separated list of parameter names in parentheses. These identifiers can be used within the body of the function to refer to the argument values passed when the function is invoked.  The body of the function is composed of any number of Java- Script statements, contained within curly braces. These state- ments are not executed when the function is defined. Instead, they are associated with the new function object for execution when the function is invoked.  54  Chapter 4: Statements   Here are some more examples of function declarations:  function hypotenuse x, y  {     return Math.sqrt x*x + y*y ; }  function factorial n  {          A recursive function     if  n <= 1  return 1;     return n * factorial n - 1 ; }  Function declaration statements may appear in top-level Java- Script  code,  or  they  may  be  nested  within  other  functions. When nested, however, function declarations may only appear at the top level of the function they are nested within. That is, function  definitions  may  not  appear  within  if  statements, while loops, or any other statements. Function  declaration  statements  differ  from  function  defini- tion expressions in that they include a function name. Both forms create a new function object, but the function declara- tion statement also declares the function name as a variable and assigns the function object to it. Like variables declared with var, functions defined with function definition statements are implicitly “hoisted” to the top of the containing script or function, so that all functions in a script or all nested functions in a function are declared before any other code is run. This means that you can invoke a JavaScript function before you declare it.  Conditionals Conditional statements execute or skip other statements de- pending on the value of a specified expression. These state- ments are the decision points of your code, and they are also sometimes known as “branches.” If you imagine a JavaScript interpreter following a path through your code, the conditional statements are the places where the code branches into two or more  paths  and  the  interpreter  must  choose  which  path  to follow.  Conditionals   55   if The  if  statement  is  the  fundamental  control  statement  that allows  JavaScript  to  execute  statements  conditionally.  This statement has two forms. The first is:  if  expression      statement  In this form, expression is evaluated. If the resulting value is truthy,  statement  is  executed.  If  expression  is  falsy,  state ment is not executed:  if  username == null     If username is null or undefined,     username = "John Doe";     define it  Note that the parentheses around the expression are a required part of the syntax for the if statement. The second form of the if statement introduces an else clause that is executed when expression is false. Its syntax is:  if  expression        statement1 else       statement2  This form of the statement executes statement1 if expression is  truthy  and  executes  statement2  if  expression  is  falsy.  For example:  if  n == 1  {     console.log "You have 1 new message." ; } else {     console.log "You have " + n + " new messages." ; }  else if The if else statement evaluates an expression and executes one of two pieces of code, depending on the outcome. But what about when you need to execute one of many pieces of code? One way to do this is with an else if statement. else if is not really  a  JavaScript  statement,  but  simply  a  frequently  used  56  Chapter 4: Statements   programming idiom that results when repeated if else state- ments are used: if  n == 1  {        Execute code block 1 } else if  n == 2  {        Execute code block 2 } else if  n == 3  {        Execute code block 3 } else {        If all else fails, execute block 4 }  There is nothing special about this code. It is just a series of if statements, where each following if is part of the else clause of the previous statement. Using the else if idiom is preferable to, and more legible than, writing these statements out in their syntactically equivalent, fully nested form:  if  n == 1  {        Execute code block 1 } else {     if  n == 2  {            Execute code block 2     }     else {         if  n == 3  {                Execute code block 3         }         else {                If all else fails, execute block 4         }     } }  switch An if statement causes a branch in the flow of a program’s execution, and you can use the  else if idiom to perform a multiway branch. This is not the best solution, however, when all of the branches depend on the value of the same expression.  Conditionals   57   In this case, it is wasteful to repeatedly evaluate that expression in multiple if statements. The  switch  statement  handles  exactly  this  situation.  The switch keyword is followed by an expression in parentheses and a block of code in curly braces:  switch expression  {       statements }  However, the full syntax of a switch statement is more complex than this. Various locations in the block of code are labeled with the case keyword followed by an expression and a colon. case is like a labeled statement, except that instead of giving the labeled statement a name, it associates an expression with the statement. When a switch executes, it computes the value of expression and then looks for a case label whose expression evaluates to the same value  where sameness is determined by the === operator . If it finds one, it starts executing the block of code at the statement labeled by the case. If it does not find a case with a matching value, it looks for a statement labeled default:. If there is no  default: label, the  switch statement skips the block of code altogether.  The following switch statement is equivalent to the repeated if else statements shown in the previous section:  switch n  {   case 1:                        Start here if n === 1        Execute code block 1.     break;                       Stop here   case 2:                        Start here if n === 2        Execute code block 2.     break;                       Stop here   case 3:                        Start here if n === 3        Execute code block 3.     break;                       Stop here   default:                       If all else fails...        Execute code block 4.     break;                       stop here }  58  Chapter 4: Statements   Note the break keyword used at the end of each case in the code above. The break statement, described later in this chap- ter, causes the interpreter to break out of the switch statement and continue with the statement that follows it. The case clau- ses in a switch statement specify only the starting point of the desired code; they do not specify any ending point. In the ab- sence of break statements, a switch statement begins executing its block of code at the case label that matches the value of its expression and continues executing statements until it reaches the end of the block. Usually you will want to end every case with a break or return statement. Here  is  a  more  realistic  example  of  the  switch  statement;  it converts a value to a string in a way that depends on the type of the value:  function convert x  {     switch typeof x  {       case 'number':    Convert to a hexadecimal integer         return x.toString 16 ;       case 'string':    Enclose it in quotes         return '"' + x + '"';       default:          Any other type         return String x ;     } }  Note that in the two previous examples, the case keywords are followed  by  number  and  string  literals,  respectively.  This  is how the switch statement is most often used in practice, but note that the ECMAScript standard allows each case to be fol- lowed by an arbitrary expression.  Loops To understand conditional statements, we imagined the Java- Script  interpreter  following  a  branching  path  through  your source code. The looping statements are those that bend that path back upon itself to repeat portions of your code. Java- Script has four looping statements: while, do while, for, and for in.  Loops   59   while The while statement is JavaScript’s basic loop. It has the fol- lowing syntax:  while  expression        statement  To  execute  a  while  statement,  the  interpreter  first  evaluates expression. If the value of the expression is falsy, then the in- terpreter skips over the statement that serves as the loop body and moves on to the next statement in the program. If, on the other hand, the expression is truthy, the interpreter executes the statement and repeats, jumping back to the top of the loop and evaluating expression again. Another way to say this is that the interpreter executes statement repeatedly while the expres sion is truthy. Note that you can create an infinite loop with the syntax while true . Here is an example of a while loop that prints the numbers from 0 to 9:  var count = 0; while  count < 10  {     console.log count ;     count++; }  As you can see, the variable count starts off at 0 and is incre- mented each time the body of the loop runs. Once the loop has executed 10 times, the expression becomes false  i.e., the vari- able count is no longer less than 10 , the while statement fin- ishes, and the interpreter can move on to the next statement in the program.  do while The do while loop is like a while loop, except that the loop expression is tested at the bottom of the loop rather than at the top. This means that the body of the loop is always executed at least once. The syntax of this relatively uncommon loop is:  60  Chapter 4: Statements   do       statement   while  expression ;  Here’s an example of a do while loop:  function printArray a  {     var len = a.length, i = 0;     if  len == 0          console.log "Empty Array" ;     else {         do {             console.log a[i] ;         } while  ++i < len ;     } }  for The for statement simplifies loops that follow a common pat- tern. Most loops have a counter variable of some kind. This variable is initialized before the loop starts and is tested before each iteration of the loop. Finally, the counter variable is in- cremented or otherwise updated at the end of the loop body, just before the variable is tested again. In this kind of loop, the initialization, the test, and the update are the three crucial ma- nipulations of a loop variable. The for statement encodes each of these three manipulations as an expression and makes those expressions an explicit part of the loop syntax:  for initialize ; test ; increment        statement  initialize, test, and increment are three expressions  separa- ted by semicolons  that are responsible for initializing, testing, and incrementing the loop variable. Putting them all in the first line of the loop makes it easy to understand what a for loop is doing and prevents mistakes such as forgetting to initialize or increment the loop variable.  The simplest way to explain how a for loop works is to show the equivalent while loop:  Loops   61   initialize;   while test  {       statement       increment;   }  In other words, the initialize expression is evaluated once, before the loop begins. To be useful, this expression must have side effects  usually an assignment . JavaScript also allows ini tialize to be a var variable declaration statement so that you can declare and initialize a loop counter at the same time. The test expression is evaluated before each iteration and controls whether the body of the loop is executed. If test evaluates to a truthy value, the statement that is the body of the loop is executed. Finally, the increment expression is evaluated. Again, this must be an expression with side effects in order to be use- ful. Generally, either it is an assignment expression, or it uses the ++ or -- operators. We can print the numbers from 0 to 9 with a for loop like the following. Contrast it with the equivalent while loop shown above:  for var count = 0; count < 10; count++      console.log count ;  for in The for in statement uses the for keyword, but it is a com- pletely different kind of loop than the regular for loop. A for  in loop looks like this:  for  variable in object        statement  variable typically names a variable, but it may also be a var statement that declares a single variable. object is an expres- sion  that  evaluates  to  an  object.  As  usual,  statement  is  the statement or statement block that serves as the body of the loop.  It is easy to use a regular for loop to iterate through the ele- ments of an array:  62  Chapter 4: Statements      Assign array indexes to variable i for var i = 0; i < a.length; i++       console.log a[i] ;    Print each array element  The for in loop makes it easy to do the same for the properties of an object:     Assign property names of o to variable p for var p in o      console.log o[p] ;    Print each property  To execute a for in statement, the JavaScript interpreter first evaluates the object expression and then executes the body of the loop once for each enumerable property of the resulting object. Before each iteration, however, the interpreter assigns the name of the property to the variable. The for in loop does not actually enumerate all properties of an object, only the enumerable properties  see “Property At- tributes” on page 87 . The various built-in methods defined by  core  JavaScript  are  not  enumerable.  All  objects  have  a toString   method, for example, but the for in loop does not enumerate this toString property. In addition to built-in meth- ods, many other properties of the built-in objects are nonenu- merable. All properties and methods defined by your code are enumerable, however.  But in ECMAScript 5, you can make them nonenumerable using techniques explained in “Property Attributes” on page 87.   The ECMAScript specification does not describe the order in which the for in loop enumerates the properties of an object. In practice, however, JavaScript implementations from all ma- jor browser vendors enumerate the properties of simple objects in the order in which they were defined, with older properties enumerated first. If an object was created as an object literal, its enumeration order is the same order that the properties ap- pear in the literal. Note that this enumeration order does not apply to all objects. In particular, if an object includes array index properties, those properties may be enumerated in nu- meric order rather than in creation order.  Loops   63   Jumps Another  category  of  JavaScript  statements  are  jump  state- ments. As the name implies, these cause the JavaScript inter- preter  to  jump  to  a  new  location  in  the  source  code.  The break statement makes the interpreter jump to the end of a loop or other statement. continue makes the interpreter skip the rest of the body of a loop and jump back to the top of a loop to begin  a  new  iteration.  JavaScript  allows  statements  to  be named, or labeled, and the break and continue can identify the target  loop  or  other  statement  label.  The  return  statement makes the interpreter jump from a function invocation back to the  code  that  invoked  it  and  also  supplies  the  value  for  the invocation. The throw statement raises, or “throws,” an excep- tion and is designed to work with the try catch finally state- ment, which establishes a block of exception handling code.  Labeled Statements Any statement may be labeled by preceding it with an identifier and a colon:  identifier: statement  By labeling a statement, you give it a name that you can use to refer to it elsewhere in your program. You can label any state- ment, although it is only useful to label statements that have bodies,  such  as  loops  and  conditionals.  By  giving  a  loop  a name, you can use break and continue statements inside the body of the loop to exit the loop or to jump directly to the top of the loop to begin the next iteration. break and continue are the only JavaScript statements that use statement labels; they are covered later in this chapter. Here is an example of a labeled while loop and a continue statement that uses the label.  mainloop: while token != null  {        Code omitted...     continue mainloop;    Jump to top of the named loop        More code omitted... }  64  Chapter 4: Statements   break The break statement, used alone, causes the innermost enclos- ing loop or switch statement to exit immediately. Its syntax is simple:  break;  Because  it  causes  a  loop  or  switch  to  exit,  this  form  of  the break statement is legal only if it appears inside one of these statements.  You’ve already seen examples of the break statement within a switch statement. In loops, it is typically used to exit prema- turely when, for whatever reason, there is no longer any need to complete the loop. When a loop has complex termination conditions, it is often easier to implement some of these con- ditions  with  break  statements  rather  than  trying  to  express them  all  in  a  single  loop  expression.  The  following  code searches the elements of an array for a particular value. The loop terminates in the normal way when it reaches the end of the array; it terminates with a break statement if it finds what it is looking for in the array:  for var i = 0; i < a.length; i++  {     if  a[i] == target  break; }  Although  it  is  rarely  used  in  practice,  JavaScript  allows  the break keyword to be followed by a statement label  just the identifier, with no colon :  break labelname;  When  break is used with a label, it jumps to the end of, or terminates, the enclosing statement that has the specified label. It is a syntax error to use break in this form if there is no en- closing statement with the specified label. With this form of the break statement, the named statement need not be a loop or switch: break can “break out of” any enclosing statement.  Jumps   65   continue The continue statement is similar to the break statement. In- stead of exiting a loop, however, continue restarts a loop at the next iteration. The continue statement’s syntax is just as simple as the break statement’s:  The continue statement can also be used with a label:  continue;  continue labelname;  The  continue  statement,  in  both  its  labeled  and  unlabeled forms, can be used only within the body of a loop. Using it anywhere else causes a syntax error.  The following example shows an unlabeled continue statement being used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop when an error occurs:  for i = 0; i < data.length; i++  {     if  isNaN data[i]   continue;    Skip non-numbers.     total += data[i]; }  Like the break statement, the continue statement can be used in its labeled form within nested loops, when the loop to be restarted is not the immediately enclosing loop.  return Recall that function invocations are expressions and that all expressions have values. A return statement within a function specifies the value of invocations of that function. Here’s the syntax of the return statement:  return expression;  A return statement may appear only within the body of a func- tion. It is a syntax error for it to appear anywhere else. When the return statement is executed, the function that contains it returns the value of expression to its caller. For example:  66  Chapter 4: Statements   function square x  { return x*x; }    Returns x squared square 2     This invocation evaluates to 4  With no return statement, a function invocation simply exe- cutes each of the statements in the function body in turn until it reaches the end of the function, and then returns to its caller. In this case, the invocation expression evaluates to undefined. The return statement can also be used without an expression to make the function return undefined before it reaches the end of its body. For example:  function display_object o  {        Return immediately if o is null or undefined.     if  !o  return;        Rest of function goes here... }  throw An exception is a signal that indicates that some sort of excep- tional condition or error has occurred. To throw an exception is to signal such an error or exceptional condition. To catch an exception is to handle it—to take whatever actions are neces- sary  or  appropriate  to  recover  from  the  exception.  In  Java- Script, exceptions are thrown whenever a runtime error occurs and  whenever  the  program  explicitly  throws  one  using  the throw  statement.  Exceptions  are  caught  with  the  try catch  finally statement, which is described next. The throw statement has the following syntax:  throw expression;  expression  may  evaluate  to  a  value  of  any  type.  You  might throw a number that represents an error code or a string that contains a human-readable error message. The Error class and its  subclasses  are  used  when  the  JavaScript  interpreter  itself throws an error, and you can use them as well. An Error object has a name property that specifies the type of error and a mes sage property that holds the string passed to the constructor function  see the Error class in the reference section . Here is  Jumps   67   an example function that throws an Error object when invoked with an invalid argument: function factorial x  {        If x is invalid, throw an exception!     if  x < 0  throw new Error "x must not be negative" ;        Otherwise, compute a value and return normally     for var f = 1; x > 1; f *= x, x--   * empty *  ;     return f; }  When an exception is thrown, the JavaScript interpreter im- mediately stops normal program execution and jumps to the nearest exception handler. Exception handlers are written us- ing the catch clause of the try catch finally statement, which is described in the next section. If the block of code in which the exception was thrown does not have an associated catch clause, the interpreter checks the next highest enclosing block of code to see if it has an exception handler associated with it. This  continues  until  a  handler  is  found.  If  an  exception  is thrown  in  a  function  that  does  not  contain  a  try catch  finally statement to handle it, the exception propagates up to the  code  that  invoked  the  function.  In  this  way,  exceptions propagate up through the lexical structure of JavaScript meth- ods and up the call stack. If no exception handler is ever found, the exception is treated as an error and is reported to the user.  try catch finally The  try catch finally  statement  is  JavaScript’s  exception handling mechanism. The try clause of this statement simply defines the block of code whose exceptions are to be handled. The try block is followed by a catch clause, which is a block of statements that are invoked when an exception occurs any- where within the try block. The catch clause is followed by a  finally block containing cleanup code that is guaranteed to be executed, regardless of what happens in the try block. Both the catch and finally blocks are optional, but a try block must be  accompanied  by  at  least  one  of  these  blocks.  The  try, catch, and finally blocks all begin and end with curly braces.  68  Chapter 4: Statements   These braces are a required part of the syntax and cannot be omitted, even if a clause contains only a single statement.  The following code illustrates the syntax and purpose of the try catch finally statement:  try {      Normally, this code runs from the top of the block      to the bottom without problems. But it can      sometimes throw an exception, either directly, with      a throw statement, or indirectly, by calling a      method that throws an exception. } catch  e  {      The statements in this block are executed if, and      only if, the try block throws an exception. These      statements can use the local variable e to refer      to the Error object or other value that was thrown.      This block may handle the exception somehow, may      ignore the exception by doing nothing, or may      rethrow the exception with throw. } finally {      This block contains statements that are always      executed, regardless of what happens in the try      block. They are executed when the try block      terminates:        1  normally, after reaching the bottom        2  because of a break, continue, or return        3  with an exception handled by a catch above        4  with an uncaught exception that is propagating }  Note  that  the  catch  keyword  is  followed  by  an  identifier  in parentheses. This identifier is like a function parameter. When an exception is caught, the value associated with the exception  an Error object, for example  is assigned to this parameter. Unlike  regular  variables,  the  identifier  associated  with  a catch  clause  has  block  scope—it  is  only  defined  within  the catch block. Here is a realistic example of the try catch statement. It uses the factorial   method defined in the previous section and the  client-side  JavaScript  methods  prompt    and  alert    for input and output:  Jumps   69   try {        Ask the user to enter a number     var n = Number prompt "Enter an number", ""  ;        Compute the factorial of the number,        assuming the input is valid.     var f = factorial n ;        Display the result     alert n + "! = " + f ;   } catch  ex  {       We end up here on invalid input.     alert ex ;     Tell the user what the error is. }  Miscellaneous Statements This  section  describes  the  remaining  three  JavaScript  state- ments—with, debugger, and use strict.  with When JavaScript looks up the value of a variable, it first looks at the variables defined within the current function, then  if the function is nested  at variables defined in enclosing functions and finally at global variables. The with statement temporarily alters the way variables are looked up by specifying an object whose properties should be treated as if they were variables. It has the following syntax:  with  object      statement  This statement executes statement somewhat as if it was the body of a nested function and the properties of object were parameters passed to that function.  The  with  statement  is  forbidden  in  strict  mode   see  “use strict”   and  should  be  considered  deprecated  in  nonstrict mode: avoid using it whenever possible. JavaScript code that uses with is difficult to optimize and is likely to run much more slowly  than  the  equivalent  code  written  without  the  with statement.  70  Chapter 4: Statements   debugger The debugger statement normally does nothing. If, however, a debugger program is available and is running, then an imple- mentation may  but is not required to  perform some kind of debugging action. In practice, this statement acts like a break- point: execution of JavaScript code stops and you can use the debugger to print variables’ values, examine the call stack, and so on. Suppose, for example, that you are getting an exception in your function f   because it is being called with an undefined argument, and you can’t figure out where this call is coming from. To help you in debugging this problem, you might alter f   so that it begins like this:  function f o  {   if  o === undefined  debugger;    Debug hook      The rest of the function goes here. }  Now, when f   is called with no argument, execution will stop, and you can use the debugger to inspect the call stack and find out where this incorrect call is coming from.  The debugger statement was formally added to the language by ECMAScript 5, but it has been implemented by major browser vendors for quite some time.  “use strict” "use strict" is a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5. Di- rectives  are  not  statements   but  are  close  enough  that  "use strict" is documented here . "use strict" does not involve any JavaScript keywords: it is simply a JavaScript string literal expression,  and  is  ignored  by  ECMAScript  3  interpreters. When placed at the beginning of a script or of a function body, however,  it  has  special  meaning  to  an  ECMAScript  5 interpreter.  The  purpose  of  a  "use  strict"  directive  is  to  indicate  that the code that follows  in the script or function  is strict code. Strict  code  is  executed  in  strict  mode.  The  strict  mode  of  Miscellaneous Statements   71   ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the language that fixes a few important language deficiencies and provides stronger error checking and increased security. The most important dif- ferences  between  strict  mode  and  non-strict  mode  are  the following:    The with statement is not allowed in strict mode.   In strict mode, all variables must be declared: a Referen- ceError is thrown if you assign a value to an identifier that is not a declared variable, parameter, or property of the global object.  In nonstrict mode, this implicitly declares a global variable by adding a new property to the global object.     In strict mode, functions invoked as functions  rather than as methods  have a this value of undefined.  In nonstrict mode, functions invoked as functions are always passed the global object as their this value.  This difference can be  used  to  determine  whether  an  implementation  sup- ports strict mode:  var hasStrictMode =  function   {     "use strict";      return this === undefined; }   ;    In strict mode, assignments to nonwritable properties and attempts to create new properties on nonextensible ob- jects  throw  a  TypeError.   In  nonstrict  mode,  these  at- tempts fail silently.  Similarly, in strict mode, an attempt to  delete  a  nonconfigurable  property  or  a  nonproperty value  throws  a  TypeError  or  SyntaxError.   In  nonstrict mode, the attempt fails and the delete expression evalu- ates to false.     In strict mode, code passed to eval   cannot declare vari- ables or define functions in the caller’s scope as it can in nonstrict mode. Instead, variable and function definitions live in a new scope created for the eval  . This scope is discarded when the eval   returns.  72  Chapter 4: Statements     In strict mode, octal integer literals  beginning with a 0 that is not followed by an x  are not allowed.  In nonstrict mode, some implementations allow octal literals.     In  strict  mode,  the  identifiers  eval  and  arguments  are treated like keywords, and you are not allowed to change their value.  Miscellaneous Statements   73    CHAPTER 5 Objects  JavaScript’s fundamental datatype is the object. An object is a composite value: it aggregates multiple values  primitive values or other objects  and allows you to store and retrieve those values by name. An object is an unordered collection of prop- erties, each of which has a name and a value. Property names are strings, so we can say that objects map strings to values. This string-to-value mapping goes by various names: you are probably already familiar with the fundamental data structure under the name “hash,” “hashtable,” “dictionary,” or “asso- ciative array.” An object is more than a simple string-to-value map, however. In addition to maintaining its own set of prop- erties, a JavaScript object also inherits the properties of another object, known as its “prototype.” The methods of an object are typically  inherited  properties,  and  this  “prototypal  inheri- tance” is a key feature of JavaScript.  JavaScript  objects  are  dynamic—properties  can  usually  be added and deleted—but they can be used to simulate the static objects and “structs” of statically typed languages. They can also be used  by ignoring the value part of the string-to-value mapping  to represent sets of strings.  Any value in JavaScript that is not a string, a number, true, false, null, or undefined is an object.  75   Objects are mutable and are manipulated by reference rather than by value: if the variable x refers to an object, and the code var y = x; is executed, the variable y holds a reference to the same object, not a copy of that object. Any modifications made to the object through the variable y are also visible through the variable x.  Creating Objects Objects can be created with object literals, with the new key- word,  and   in  ECMAScript  5   with  the  Object.create   function.  Object Literals The easiest way to create an object is to include an object literal in your JavaScript code. An object literal is a comma-separated list of colon-separated name:value pairs, enclosed within curly braces. A property name is a JavaScript identifier or a string literal  the empty string is allowed . A property value is any JavaScript expression; the value of the expression  it may be a primitive value or an object value  becomes the value of the property. Here are some examples:  var empty = {};              An object with no properties var point = { x:0, y:0 };    Two properties var point2 = {               Another object literal     x:point.x,               With more complex properties     y:point.y+1 };   var book = {    Nonidentifier property names are quoted     "main title": "JavaScript",    space in property name     'sub-title': "Pocket Ref",     punctuation in name     "for": "all audiences",        reserved word name };  Creating Objects with new The new operator creates and initializes a new object. The new keyword must be followed by a function invocation. A function  76  Chapter 5: Objects   used in this way is called a constructor and serves to initialize a newly created object. Core JavaScript includes built-in con- structors for native types. For example:  var o = new Object  ;        An empty object: same as {}. var a = new Array  ;         An empty array: same as []. var d = new Date  ;          A Date for the current time. var r = new RegExp "js" ;    A pattern matching object.  In addition to these built-in constructors, it is common to de- fine your own constructor functions to initialize newly created objects. Doing so is covered in Chapter 8.  Prototypes Before we can cover the third object creation technique, we must pause for a moment to explain prototypes. Every Java- Script object has a second JavaScript object  or null, but this is rare  associated with it. This second object is known as a prototype,  and  the  first  object  inherits  properties  from  the prototype.  All objects created by object literals have the same prototype object, and we can refer to this prototype object in JavaScript code as Object.prototype. Objects created using the new key- word and a constructor invocation use the value of the proto type property of the constructor function as their prototype. So the object created by new Object   inherits from Object.pro totype just as the object created by {} does. Similarly, the object created by new Array   uses Array.prototype as its prototype, and the object created by new Date   uses Date.prototype as its prototype.  Object.prototype is one of the rare objects that has no proto- type: it does not inherit any properties. Other prototype objects are normal objects that do have a prototype. All of the built-in constructors  and most user-defined constructors  have a pro- totype  that  inherits  from  Object.prototype.  For  example, Date.prototype inherits properties from Object.prototype, so a Date object created by new Date   inherits properties from  Creating Objects   77   both Date.prototype and Object.prototype. This linked series of prototype objects is known as a prototype chain.  An explanation of how property inheritance works is in “Prop- erty  Inheritance”  on  page  80.  We’ll  learn  how  to  query the  prototype  of  an  object  in  “The  prototype  At- tribute” on page 90. And Chapter 8 explains the connection between prototypes and constructors in more detail: it shows how to define new “classes” of objects by writing a constructor function and setting its prototype property to the prototype object  to  be  used  by  the  “instances”  created  with  that constructor.  Object.create   ECMAScript 5 defines a method, Object.create  , that creates a new object, using its first argument as the prototype of that object.  Object.create    also  takes  an  optional  second  argu- ment  that  describes  the  properties  of  the  new  object. This  second  argument  in  “Property  At- tributes” on page 87.  is  covered   Object.create   is a static function, not a method invoked on individual objects. To use it, simply pass the desired prototype object:     o1 inherits properties x and y. var o1 = Object.create {x:1, y:2} ;  You can pass null to create a new object that does not have a prototype, but if you do this, the newly created object will not inherit  anything,  not  even  basic  methods  like  toString    which means it won’t work with the + operator either :     o2 inherits no properties or methods. var o2 = Object.create null ;  If you want to create an ordinary empty object  like the object returned by {} or new Object   , pass Object.prototype:     o3 is like {} or new Object  . var o3 = Object.create Object.prototype ;  78  Chapter 5: Objects   The ability to create a new object with an arbitrary prototype  put another way: the ability to create an “heir” for any object  is a powerful one, and we can simulate it in ECMAScript 3 with a function like the one in Example 5-1.  Example 5-1. Creating a new object that inherits from a prototype     inherit   returns a newly created object that inherits    properties from the prototype object p.  It uses the    ECMAScript 5 function Object.create   if it is defined,    and otherwise falls back to an older technique. function inherit p  {     if  p == null            p must be a non-null         throw TypeError  ;      if  Object.create        Use Object.create            return Object.create p ;      if it is defined.     var t = typeof p;        Make sure p is an object     if  t !== "object" &&  t !== "function"          throw TypeError  ;     function f   {};         Define a dummy constructor.     f.prototype = p;         Set its prototype property     return new f  ;          Use it to create an "heir" of p. }  The code in the inherit   function will make more sense after we’ve covered constructors in Chapter 8.  Properties The most important part of an object are its properties. The sections that follow explain them in detail.  Querying and Setting Properties To obtain the value of a property, you can use the dot  .  or square  bracket   []   operators  described  in  “Property  Ac- cess” on page 26. The left-hand side should be an expression whose value is an object. If using the dot operator, the right- hand must be a simple identifier that names the property. If using square brackets, the value within the brackets must be  Properties   79   an expression that evaluates to a string  or number  that con- tains the desired property name:     Get the "author" property of the book. var author = book.author;          Get the "surname" property of the author. var name = author.surname          Get the "main title" property of the book. var title = book["main title"]  To create or set a property, use a dot or square brackets as you would to query the property, but put them on the left-hand side of an assignment expression:     Create an "edition" property of book. book.edition = 6;    Set the "main title" property. book["main title"] = "ECMAScript";  Property Inheritance JavaScript objects have a set of “own properties,” and they also inherit a set of properties from their prototype object. To un- derstand this, we must consider property access in more detail. The examples in this section use the inherit   function from Example  5-1  in  order  to  create  objects  with  specified prototypes.  Suppose you query the property x in the object o. If o does not have an own property with that name, the prototype object of o is queried for the property x. If the prototype object does not have an own property by that name, but has a prototype itself, the query is performed on the prototype of the prototype. This continues until the property x is found or until an object with a null prototype is searched. As you can see, the prototype at- tribute of an object creates a chain or linked list from which properties are inherited:     o inherits object methods from Object.prototype var o = {}             o.x = 1;                 and has an own property x.    p inherits properties from o and Object.prototype var p = inherit o ;    p.y = 2;                 and has an own property y.  80  Chapter 5: Objects      q inherits properties from p, o, and Object.prototype var q = inherit p ;    q.z = 3;                 and has an own property z.    toString is inherited from Object.prototype     var s = q.toString  ;     x and y are inherited from o and p q.x + q.y                => 3  Now suppose you assign to the property x of the object o. If o already has an own  noninherited  property named x, then the assignment simply changes the value of this existing property. Otherwise, the assignment creates a new property named x on the object o. If o previously inherited the property x, that in- herited property is now hidden by the newly created own prop- erty with the same name.  Deleting Properties The delete operator  “The delete Operator” on page 46  re- moves a property from an object. Its single operand should be a property access expression. Surprisingly, delete does not op- erate on the value of the property but on the property itself:  delete book.author;           book now has no author. delete book["main title"];    or a "main title", either.  The delete operator only deletes own properties, not inherited ones.  To delete an inherited property, you must delete it from the prototype object in which it is defined. Doing this affects every object that inherits from that prototype.   Testing Properties JavaScript objects can be thought of as sets of properties, and it is often useful to be able to test for membership in the set— to check whether an object has a property with a given name. You  can  do  this  with  the  in  operator,  with  the  hasOwnProp erty    and  propertyIsEnumerable    methods,  or  simply  by querying the property.  Properties   81   The in operator expects a property name  as a string  on its left side and an object on its right. It returns true if the object has an own property or an inherited property by that name:  var o = { x: 1 } "x" in o;           true: o has an own property "x" "y" in o;           false: o doesn't have a property "y" "toString" in o;    true: o inherits a toString property  The hasOwnProperty   method of an object tests whether that object has an own property with the given name. It returns false for inherited properties:  var o = { x: 1 } o.hasOwnProperty "x" ;    true: o has an own property x o.hasOwnProperty "y" ;    false: o has no property y    toString is an inherited property o.hasOwnProperty "toString" ;    false  The  propertyIsEnumerable    method  refines  the  hasOwnProp erty   test. It returns true only if the named property is an own property and its enumerable attribute is true. Certain built-in properties are not enumerable. Properties created by normal JavaScript code are enumerable unless you’ve used one of the ECMAScript  5  methods  shown  later  to  make  them nonenumerable:  var o = inherit { y: 2 } ; o.x = 1;    o has an own enumerable property x o.propertyIsEnumerable "x" ;     true    y is inherited, not own o.propertyIsEnumerable "y" ;     false    false: the toString method is not enumerable Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable "toString" ;  Instead of using the in operator, it is often sufficient to simply query the property and use !== to make sure it is not undefined:  var o = { x: 1 } o.x !== undefined;           true: o has a property x o.y !== undefined;           false: o has no property y o.toString !== undefined;    true: o inherits it  There is one thing the in operator can do that the simple prop- erty  access  technique  shown  above  cannot  do.  in  can  82  Chapter 5: Objects   distinguish between properties that do not exist and properties that exist but have been set to undefined. Consider this code:  var o = { x: undefined } o.x !== undefined    false: property is undefined o.y !== undefined    false: property doesn't exist "x" in o             true:  property exists "y" in o             false: property doesn't exist delete o.x;          Delete the property x "x" in o             false: it doesn't exist anymore  Enumerating Properties Instead of testing for the existence of individual properties, we sometimes want to iterate through or obtain a list of all the properties of an object. This is usually done with the for in loop, although ECMAScript 5 provides two handy alternatives.  The for in loop was covered in “for in” on page 62. It runs the body of the loop once for each enumerable property  own or inherited   of  the  specified  object,  assigning  the  name  of  the property to the loop variable. Built-in methods that objects in- herit  are  not  enumerable,  but  the  properties  that  your  code adds  to  objects  are  enumerable   unless  you  use  one  of  the functions described later to make them nonenumerable . For example:     This object has three enumerable own properties var o = {x:1, y:2, z:3};                 Its inherited methods are not enumerable:  o.propertyIsEnumerable "toString"     => false    This loop prints x, y and z but not toString for p in o  console.log p ;  Some utility libraries add new methods  or other properties  to  Object.prototype so that they are inherited by, and available to, all objects. Prior to ECMAScript 5, however, there is no way to  make  these  added  methods  nonenumerable,  so  they  are enumerated by for in loops. To guard against this, you might want to filter the properties returned by for in. Here are two ways you might do so:  for p in o  {     if  !o.hasOwnProperty p      Skip inherited props  Properties   83           continue; }  for p in o  {     if  typeof o[p] === "function"     Skip methods         continue; }  Here is a utility function that uses a for in loop to copy the properties of one object to another:   *  * Copy the enumerable properties of p to o,  * and return o. If o and p have a property with the   * same name, o's property is overwritten.  *  function extend o, p  {     for prop in p  {          For all props in p.         o[prop] = p[prop];    Add the property to o.     }     return o; }  In  addition  to  the  for in  loop,  ECMAScript  5  defines  two functions  that  enumerate  property  names.  The  first  is Object.keys  , which returns an array of the names of the enu- merable own properties of an object. The second ECMAScript 5  property  enumeration  function  is  Object.getOwnProperty Names  . It works like Object.keys   but returns the names of all the own properties of the specified object, not just the enu- merable properties.  Serializing Properties and Objects Object  serialization  is  the  process  of  converting  an  object’s state to a string from which it can later be restored. ECMA- Script 5 provides the native functions JSON.stringify   and  JSON.parse   to serialize and restore JavaScript objects. These functions use the JSON data interchange format  see http:  json .org . JSON stands for “JavaScript Object Notation,” and its syntax  is  very  similar  to  that  of  JavaScript  object  and  array literals:  84  Chapter 5: Objects   o = {x:1, y:[false,null,""]};    A test object s = JSON.stringify o ;    '{"x":1,"y":[false,null,""]}' p = JSON.parse s ;        p is a deep copy of o  The native implementation of these functions in ECMAScript 5 was modeled very closely after the public-domain ECMA- Script  3  implementation  available  at  http:  json.org json2.js. For practical purposes, the implementations are the same, and you can use these ECMAScript 5 functions in ECMAScript 3 with this json2.js module.  Note that JSON syntax is a subset of JavaScript syntax, and it cannot represent all JavaScript values. Objects, arrays, strings, finite numbers, true, false, and null are supported and can be serialized and restored.  Property Getters and Setters We’ve said that a property has a name and a value. In ECMA- Script 5  and in recent ECMAScript 3 versions of major brows- ers other than IE  the value may be replaced by one or two methods, known as a getter and a setter. Properties defined by getters and setters are sometimes known as accessor proper- ties to distinguish them from data properties that have a simple value.  When  a  program  queries  the  value  of  an  accessor  property, JavaScript invokes the getter method  passing no arguments . The return value of this method becomes the value of the prop- erty access expression. When a program sets the value of an accessor property, JavaScript invokes the setter method, pass- ing the value of the right-hand side of the assignment. This method is responsible for “setting,” in some sense, the property value. The return value of the setter method is ignored.  The easiest way to define accessor properties is with an exten- sion to the object literal syntax:  var o = {        An ordinary data property      data_prop: value,  Properties   85          An accessor property as a pair of functions     get accessor_prop   {  * return value *  },     set accessor_prop value  {  * set value *  } };  Accessor properties are defined as one or two functions whose name  is  the  same  as  the  property  name,  and  with  the  func tion keyword replaced with get and or set. Note that no colon is used to separate the name of the property from the functions that access that property, but that a comma is still required after the function body to separate the method from the next method or data property. As an example, consider the follow- ing object that represents a 2-D Cartesian point. It has ordinary data  properties  to  represent  the  x  and  y  coordinates  of  the point, and it has accessor properties for the equivalent polar coordinates of the point:  var p = {      x and y are regular read-write data properties.   x: 1.0,   y: 1.0,       r is a read-write property with getter and setter.      Don't forget to put a comma after accessor methods.   get r   {      return Math.sqrt this.x*this.x + this.y*this.y ;   },   set r newvalue  {    var oldvalue = Math.sqrt this.x*this.x + this.y*this.y ;    var ratio = newvalue oldvalue;    this.x *= ratio;    this.y *= ratio;   },       theta is a read-only accessor property.   get theta   { return Math.atan2 this.y, this.x ; } };  Here is another example of a useful object with an accessor property:     Generate strictly increasing serial numbers var serialnum = {        This data property holds the next serial number.        The $ hints that this is a private property.     $n: 0,  86  Chapter 5: Objects          Return the current value and increment it     get next   { return this.$n++; },         Set a new n, but only if it is >= current n.     set next n  {         if  n >= this.$n  this.$n = n;         else throw "serial number can only be increased";     } };  Property Attributes In addition to a name and value, properties have attributes that specify whether they can be written, enumerated, and config- ured. In ECMAScript 3, there is no way to set these attributes: all properties created by ECMAScript 3 programs are writable, enumerable, and configurable, and there is no way to change this. This section explains the ECMAScript 5 API for querying and setting property attributes.  For the purposes of this section, we are going to consider getter and setter methods of an accessor property to be property at- tributes. Following this logic, we’ll even say that the value of a data property is an attribute as well. Thus, we can say that a property has a name and four attributes. The four attributes of a data property are value, writable, enumerable, and configu- rable.  Accessor  properties  don’t  have  a  value  attribute  or  a writable attribute: their writability is determined by the pres- ence or absence of a setter. So the four attributes of an accessor property are get, set, enumerable, and configurable.  The ECMAScript 5 methods for querying and setting the at- tributes of a property use an object called a property descrip- tor to represent the set of four attributes. A property descriptor object has properties with the same names as the attributes of the property it describes. Thus, the property descriptor object of a data property has properties named value, writable, enu merable, and configurable. And the descriptor for an accessor property has get and set properties instead of value and writ able. The writable, enumerable, and configurable properties  Properties   87   are boolean values, and the get and set properties are function values, of course.  To obtain the property descriptor for a named property of a specified object, call Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor  :     Returns {value: 1, writable:true,             enumerable:true, configurable:true} Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor {x:1}, "x" ;     Query the theta property of the p object from above.    Returns { get:  *func* , set:undefined,              enumerable:true, configurable:true} Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor p, "theta" ;  As  implied  by  its  name,  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor   works only for own properties. To query the attributes of in- herited properties, you must explicitly traverse the prototype chain   see  Object.getPrototypeOf    in  “The  prototype  At- tribute” on page 90 .  To set the attributes of a property, or to create a new property with  the  specified  attributes,  call  Object.defineProperty  , passing the object to be modified, the name of the property to be created or altered, and the property descriptor object:  var o = {};     Start with no properties at all    Add a nonenumerable data property x with value 1. Object.defineProperty o, "x", { value : 1,                                  writable: true,                                 enumerable: false,                                 configurable: true} ;     Check that the property is there but is nonenumerable o.x;              => 1 Object.keys o     => []     Now modify the property x so that it is read-only Object.defineProperty o, "x", { writable: false } ;     Try to change the value of the property o.x = 2;     Fails silently or TypeError in strict mode o.x          => 1     The property is still configurable,    so we can change its value like this:  88  Chapter 5: Objects   Object.defineProperty o, "x", { value: 2 } ; o.x          => 2     Now change x to an accessor property Object.defineProperty o, "x", {     get: function   { return 0; } } ; o.x          => 0  The property descriptor you pass to Object.defineProperty   does not have to include all four attributes. If you’re creating a new property, then omitted attributes are taken to be false or undefined. If you’re modifying an existing property, then the attributes you omit are simply left unchanged. Note that this method alters an existing own property or creates a new own property, but it will not alter an inherited property.  If you want to create or modify more than one property at a time, use Object.defineProperties  . The first argument is the object that is to be modified. The second argument is an object that maps the names of the properties to be created or modified to the property descriptors for those properties. For example:  var p = Object.defineProperties {}, {     x: { value: 1, writable: true,          enumerable:true, configurable:true },       y: { value: 1, writable: true,          enumerable:true, configurable:true },     r: {          get: function   {           return Math.sqrt this.x*this.x+this.y*this.y          },         enumerable:true,         configurable:true     } } ;  We saw the ECMAScript 5 method Object.create   in “Cre- ating Objects” on page 76. We learned there that the first ar- gument to that method is the prototype object for the newly created  object.  This  method  also  accepts  a  second  optional argument,  which  is  the  same  as  the  second  argument  to Object.defineProperties  .  If  you  pass  a  set  of  property  Properties   89   descriptors to Object.create  , then they are used to add prop- erties to the newly created object.  Object Attributes Every  object  has  associated  prototype,  class,  and  extensible attributes.  The prototype Attribute An object’s prototype attribute specifies the object from which it inherits properties. The prototype attribute is set when an object is created. Recall from “Prototypes” on page 77 that ob- jects created from object literals use Object.prototype as their prototype. Objects created with new use the value of the proto type property of their constructor function as their prototype. And objects created with Object.create   use the first argu- ment to that function  which may be null  as their prototype. In ECMAScript 5, you can query the prototype of any object by passing that object to Object.getPrototypeOf  . There is no equivalent function in ECMAScript 3, but it is sometimes pos- sible to determine the prototype of an object o using the ex- pression o.constructor.prototype. To determine whether one object is the prototype of  or is part of the prototype chain of  another object, use the isPrototy peOf    method.  To  find  out  if  p  is  the  prototype  of  o  write p.isPrototypeOf o . For example:  var p = {x:1};               Define a prototype object. var o = Object.create p ;    Inherit from that prototype. p.isPrototypeOf o            => true: o inherits from p. Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf p     True for any object. Note that isPrototypeOf   performs a function similar to the instanceof operator.  90  Chapter 5: Objects   The class Attribute An object’s class attribute is a string that provides information about  the  type  of  the  object.  Neither  ECMAScript  3  nor ECMAScript 5 provide any way to set this attribute, and there is  only  an  indirect  technique  for  querying  it.  The  default toString   method  inherited from Object.prototype  returns a string of the form:  [object class]  So  to  obtain  the  class  of  an  object,  you  can  invoke  this toString   method on it, and extract the eighth through the second-to-last characters of the returned string. The tricky part is  that  many  objects  inherit  other,  more  useful  toString   methods, and to invoke the correct version of toString  , we must do so indirectly, using the Function.call   method  see “Indirect  Invocation”  on  page  120 .  Example  5-2  defines  a function that returns the class of any object you pass it.  Example 5-2. A classof   function  function classof o  {     if  o === null  return "Null";     if  o === undefined  return "Undefined";     return Object.prototype.toString.call o .slice 8,-1 ; }  The extensible Attribute The  extensible  attribute  of  an  object  specifies  whether  new properties can be added to the object or not. ECMAScript 5 defines functions for querying and setting the extensibility of an object. To determine whether an object is extensible, pass it to Object.isExtensible  . To make an object nonextensible, pass it to Object.preventExtensions  . Object.seal   works like Object.preventExtensions  , but in addition to making the object nonextensible, it also makes all of  the  own  properties  of  that  object  nonconfigurable.  This means that new properties cannot be added to the object, and existing properties cannot be deleted or configured. You can  Object Attributes   91   use  Object.isSealed    to  determine  whether  an  object  is sealed.  Object.freeze   locks objects down even more tightly. In ad- dition to making the object nonextensible and its properties nonconfigurable,  it  also  makes  all  of  the  object’s  own  data properties read-only. Use Object.isFrozen   to determine if an object is frozen.  It  is  important  to  understand  that  there  is  no  way  to  undo the effects of Object.preventExtensions  , Object.seal  , and Object.freeze  . Also, these functions affect only the object they are passed: they have no effect on the prototype of that object. Finally, note that these three functions all return the object that they are passed, which means that you can use them in nested function invocations:     Create a sealed object with a frozen prototype     and a nonenumerable property o = Object.seal Object.create Object.freeze {x:1} ,                               {y: { value: 2,                                     writable: true}}  ;  92  Chapter 5: Objects   CHAPTER 6 Arrays  An array is an ordered collection of values. Each value is called an element, and each element has a numeric position in the array, known as its index. JavaScript arrays are untyped: an ar- ray element may be of any type, and different elements of the same array may be of different types. Array elements may even be objects or other arrays, which allows you to create complex data structures, such as arrays of objects and arrays of arrays. JavaScript arrays are zero-based and use 32-bit indexes: the in- dex of the first element is 0, and the highest possible index is  4294967294   232−2 ,  for  a  maximum  array  size  of 4,294,967,295 elements. JavaScript arrays are dynamic: they grow or shrink as needed and there is no need to declare a fixed size for the array when you create it or to reallocate it when the size changes. Every JavaScript array has a length property that specifies the number of elements in the array.  JavaScript arrays are a specialized form of JavaScript object, and array indexes are really little more than property names that happen to be integers. Implementations typically optimize arrays so that access to numerically indexed array elements is faster than access to regular object properties.  Arrays inherit properties from Array.prototype, which defines a rich set of array manipulation methods. Most of these meth- ods are generic, which means that they work correctly not only  93   true  arrays,  but   for  ECMAScript 5, strings behave like arrays of characters.  for  any  “array-like  object.”   In  Creating Arrays The easiest way to create an array is with an array literal, which is  simply  a  comma-separated  list  of  array  elements  within square brackets:  var empty = [];                An array with no elements var primes = [2, 3, 5, 7];     An array of 5 numbers var misc = [{}, true, "a"];    Elements of various types  The values in an array literal need not be constants; they may be arbitrary expressions:  var base = 1024; var table = [base, base+1, base+2, base+3];  Array literals can contain object literals or other array literals:  var b = [[1,{x:1, y:2}], [2, {x:3, y:4}]];  If an array literal contains two commas in a row, with no value between, then an element is missing and the array is sparse. Missing elements are undefined:  var count = [1,,3];    Elements at indexes 0 and 2.  count[1]               => undefined var undefs = [,,];     No elements but length of 2  Array  literal  syntax  allows  an  optional  trailing  comma,  so [1,2,] has a length of 2, not 3. Another way to create an array is with the Array   constructor. You can invoke this constructor in three distinct ways:    Call it with no arguments:  var a = new Array  ;  This method creates an empty array with no elements and is equivalent to the array literal [].    Call it with a single numeric argument, which specifies a  length:  94  Chapter 6: Arrays   var a = new Array 10 ;  This technique creates an array with the specified length. This form of the Array   constructor can be used to pre- allocate an array when you know in advance how many elements will be required. Note that no values are stored in the array, and the array index properties “0,” “1,” and so on are not even defined for the array.    Explicitly specify two or more array elements or a single  nonnumeric element for the array:  var a = new Array 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, "testing" ;  In  this  form,  the  constructor  arguments  become  the elements of the new array. Using an array literal is almost always  simpler  the  Array   constructor.  this  usage  of   than   Array Elements and Length You  access  an  element  of  an  array  using  the  []  operator.  A reference to the array should appear to the left of the brackets. An  arbitrary  expression  that  has   or  can  be  converted  to   a nonnegative integer value should be inside the brackets. You can use this syntax to both read and write the value of an ele- ment of an array. Thus, the following are all legal:  var a = ["world"];     Start with a one-element array var value = a[0];      Read element 0 a[1] = 3.14;           Write element 1 i = 2;          a[i] = 3;              Write element 2 a[i + 1] = "hello";    Write element 3 a[a[i]] = a[0];        Read 0 and 2, write 3  Remember  that  arrays  are  a  specialized  kind  of  object.  The square brackets used to access array elements work just like the square brackets used to access object properties. JavaScript converts the numeric array index you specify to a string—the index  1  becomes  the  string  "1"—then  uses  that  string  as  a property name.  Array Elements and Length  95   Every array has a length property, and it is this property that makes  arrays  different  from  regular  JavaScript  objects.  The length property specifies the number of elements in the array  assuming no missing elements . Its value is one more than the highest index in the array:  [].length                => 0: the array has no elements ['a','b','c'].length     => 3: highest index is 2  All  arrays  are  objects,  and  you  can  create  properties  of  any name on them. What is special about arrays is that when you use property names that are  or convert to  nonnegative inte- gers  less  than  232–1,  the  array  automatically  maintains  the value of the length property for you. The length property is writable and if you set the length prop- erty to a nonnegative integer n smaller than its current value, any array elements whose index is greater than or equal to n are deleted from the array:  a=[1,2,3,4,5];    Start with a 5-element array. a.length = 3;    a is now [1,2,3]. a.length = 0;    Delete all elements.  a is []. a.length = 5;    Length 5, but no elts, like new Array 5  You can also set the length property of an array to a value larger than its current value. Doing this does not actually add any new elements to the array, it simply creates a sparse area at the end of the array.  Iterating Arrays The most common way to loop through the elements of an array is with a for loop  “for” on page 61 :  var keys = Object.keys o ;    An array of property names var values = []               Store property values here for var i = 0; i < keys.length; i++  {    For each index     var key = keys[i];                    Get the key      values[i] = o[key];                   Store the value }  96  Chapter 6: Arrays   In nested loops, or other contexts where performance is criti- cal, you may sometimes see this basic array iteration loop op- timized so that the array length is only looked up once rather than on each iteration:  for var i = 0, len = keys.length; i < len; i++  {       loop body remains the same }  ECMAScript 5 defines a number of new methods for iterating array elements by passing each one, in index order, to a func- tion that you define. The forEach   method is the most general of these methods:  var data = [1,2,3,4,5];    An array to iterate var sumOfSquares = 0;      Update this on each iteration data.forEach function x  {    Pass each elt to this func                  sumOfSquares += x*x;    add up squares              } ; sumOfSquares               =>55: 1+4+9+16+25  Multidimensional Arrays JavaScript does not support true multidimensional arrays, but you can approximate them with arrays of arrays. To access a value in an array of arrays, simply use the [] operator twice. For example, suppose the variable matrix is an array of arrays of numbers. Every element in matrix[x] is an array of numbers. To access a particular number within this array, you would write matrix[x][y]. Here is a concrete example that uses a two- dimensional array as a multiplication table:     Create a multidimensional array var table = new Array 10 ;       10 rows of the table for var i = 0; i < table.length; i++      table[i] = new Array 10 ;    Each row has 10 columns     Initialize the array for var row = 0; row < table.length; row++  {     for col = 0; col < table[row].length; col++  {         table[row][col] = row*col;     } }  Multidimensional Arrays   97      Use the multidimensional array to compute 5*7 var product = table[5][7];     35  Array Methods Arrays have a number of useful methods, demonstrated in the sections below.  join   The Array.join   method converts all the elements of an array to  strings  and  concatenates  them,  returning  the  resulting string. You can specify an optional string that separates the elements in the resulting string. If no separator string is speci- fied, a comma is used: var a = [1, 2, 3]; a.join  ;                => "1,2,3" a.join " " ;             => "1 2 3" a.join "" ;              => "123" var b = new Array 5 ;    Length 5 but no elements b.join '-'               => '----': a string of 4 hyphens The  Array.join    method  is  the  inverse  of  the  method String.split  ,  which  creates  an  array  by  breaking  a  string into pieces.  reverse   The Array.reverse   method reverses the order of the elements of an array and returns the reversed array. It does this in place; in other words, it doesn’t create a new array with the elements rearranged but instead rearranges them in the already existing array:  var a = [1,2,3]; a.reverse  .join      => "3,2,1" a[0]                  => 3: a is now [3,2,1]  98  Chapter 6: Arrays   sort   Array.sort   sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. When sort   is called with no arguments, it sorts the array elements in alphabetical order:  var a = new Array "banana", "cherry", "apple" ; a.sort  ; var s = a.join ", " ;     s == "apple, banana, cherry"  If an array contains undefined elements, they are sorted to the end of the array.  To sort an array into some order other than alphabetical, you must pass a comparison function as an argument to sort  . This function decides which of its two arguments should ap- pear first in the sorted array. If the first argument should appear before the second, the comparison function should return a number less than zero. If the first argument should appear after the second in the sorted array, the function should return a number greater than zero. And if the two values are equivalent  i.e.,  if  their  order  is  irrelevant ,  the  comparison  function should return 0. So, for example, to sort array elements into numerical rather than alphabetical order, you might do this:  var a = [33, 4, 1111, 222]; a.sort  ;                 Alphabetical:  1111, 222, 33, 4 a.sort function a,b  {    Numerical: 4, 33, 222, 1111            return a-b;    Returns   0        } ; a.sort function a,b  {return b-a} ;    Reverse numerical  You can perform a case-insensitive alphabetical sort as follows:  a = ['ant', 'Bug', 'cat'] a.sort  ;    case-sensitive sort: ['Bug','ant',cat'] a.sort function s,t  {      Case-insensitive sort            var a = s.toLowerCase  ;            var b = t.toLowerCase  ;            if  a < b  return -1;            if  a > b  return 1;            return 0;        } ;                  => ['ant','Bug','cat']  Array Methods   99   concat   The Array.concat   method creates and returns a new array that contains the elements of the original array on which con cat    was  invoked,  followed  by  each  of  the  arguments  to concat  . If any of these arguments is itself an array, then it is the array elements that are concatenated, not the array itself. concat   does not modify the array on which it is invoked. Here are some examples: var a = [1,2,3]; a.concat 4, 5              Returns [1,2,3,4,5] a.concat [4,5] ;           Returns [1,2,3,4,5] a.concat [4,5],[6,7]       Returns [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] a.concat 4, [5,[6,7]]      Returns [1,2,3,4,5,[6,7]]  slice   The Array.slice   method returns a slice, or subarray, of the specified array. Its two arguments specify the start and end of the slice to be returned. The returned array contains the ele- ment specified by the first argument and all subsequent ele- ments up to, but not including, the element specified by the second  argument.  If  only  one  argument  is  specified,  the  re- turned array contains all elements from the start position to the end of the array. If either argument is negative, it specifies an array element relative to the last element in the array. Note that slice   does not modify the array on which it is invoked:  var a = [1,2,3,4,5]; a.slice 0,3 ;       Returns [1,2,3] a.slice 3 ;         Returns [4,5] a.slice 1,-1 ;      Returns [2,3,4] a.slice -3,-2 ;     Returns [3]  splice   The Array.splice   method is a general-purpose method for inserting or removing elements from an array. Unlike slice   and  concat  ,  splice    modifies  the  array  on  which  it  is invoked.  100  Chapter 6: Arrays   The first argument to splice   specifies the array position at which the insertion and or deletion is to begin. The second argument specifies the number of elements that should be de- leted from  spliced out of  the array. If this second argument is omitted, all array elements from the start element to the end of the array are removed. splice   returns an array of the deleted elements, or an empty array if no elements were deleted. For example:  var a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]; a.splice 4 ;       Returns [5,6,7,8]; a is [1,2,3,4] a.splice 1,2 ;     Returns [2,3]; a is [1,4] a.splice 1,1 ;     Returns [4]; a is [1]  The first two arguments to splice   specify which array ele- ments are to be deleted. These arguments may be followed by any number of additional arguments that specify elements to be inserted into the array, starting at the position specified by the first argument. For example:  var a = [1,2,3,4,5]; a.splice 2,0,'a','b' ;    =>[]; a is [1,2,'a','b',3,4,5] a.splice 2,2,3 ;          =>['a','b']; a is [1,2,3,3,4,5] Note that, unlike concat  , splice   inserts arrays themselves, not the elements of those arrays.  push   and pop   The push   and pop   methods allow you to work with arrays as if they were stacks. The push   method appends one or more new elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. The pop   method does the reverse: it deletes the last element of an array, decrements the array length, and re- turns the value that it removed. Note that both methods mod- ify the array in place rather than produce a modified copy of the array:  var stack = [];          stack: [] stack.push 1,2 ;         stack: [1,2]      Returns 2 stack.pop  ;             stack: [1]        Returns 2 stack.push 3 ;           stack: [1,3]      Returns 2 stack.pop  ;             stack: [1]        Returns 3  Array Methods   101   stack.push [4,5] ;       stack: [1,[4,5]]  Returns 2 stack.pop                stack: [1]        Returns [4,5] stack.pop  ;             stack: []         Returns 1  unshift   and shift   The unshift   and shift   methods behave much like push   and pop  , except that they insert and remove elements from the beginning of an array rather than from the end. unshift   adds an element or elements to the beginning of the array, shifts the existing array elements up to higher indexes to make room, and returns the new length of the array. shift   removes and returns the first element of the array, shifting all subsequent elements down one place to occupy the newly vacant space at the start of the array:  var a = [];               a:[] a.unshift 1 ;             a:[1]         Returns: 1 a.unshift 22 ;            a:[22,1]      Returns: 2 a.shift  ;                a:[1]         Returns: 22 a.unshift 3,[4,5] ;       a:[3,[4,5],1] Returns: 3 a.shift  ;                a:[[4,5],1]   Returns: 3 a.shift  ;                a:[1]         Returns: [4,5] a.shift  ;                a:[]          Returns: 1  toString   An array, like any JavaScript object, has a toString   method. For an array, this method converts each of its elements to a string  calling the toString   methods of its elements, if nec- essary  and outputs a comma-separated list of those strings. Note that the output does not include square brackets or any other sort of delimiter around the array value. For example:  [1,2,3].toString               => '1,2,3' ["a", "b", "c"].toString       => 'a,b,c' [1, [2,'c']].toString          => '1,2,c'  102  Chapter 6: Arrays   ECMAScript 5 Array Methods ECMAScript 5 defines nine new array methods for iterating, mapping,  filtering,  testing,  reducing,  and  searching  arrays. Most of the methods accept a function as their first argument and  invoke  that  function  once  for  each  element   or  at  least some elements  of the array. In most cases, the function you supply is invoked with three arguments: the value of the array element, the index of the array element, and the array itself. Often, you only need the first of these argument values and can ignore the second and third values. Most of the ECMAScript 5 array methods that accept a function as their first argument accept an optional second argument. If specified, the function is invoked as if it is a method of this second argument. That is, the second argument you pass becomes the value of the this keyword inside of the function you pass. The return value of the function you pass is important, but different methods han- dle  the  return  value  in  different  ways.  None  of  the ECMAScript 5 array methods modify the array on which they are invoked, but the function you pass to the array methods may modify the array, of course.  forEach   The forEach   method iterates through an array, invoking a function you specify for each element:  var data = [1,2,3,4,5];     Compute the sum of elements var sum = 0;                Start at 0 data.forEach function value  { sum += value; } ; sum                         => 15     Now increment each array element data.forEach function v, i, a  { a[i] = v + 1; } ; data                        => [2,3,4,5,6]  ECMAScript 5 Array Methods   103   map   The map   method passes each element of the array on which it is invoked to the function you specify, and returns a new array containing the values returned by that function:  a = [1, 2, 3]; b = a.map function x  { return x*x; } ;    b is [1, 4, 9]  filter   The filter   method returns an array containing a subset of the elements of the array on which it is invoked. The function you  pass  to  it  should  be  predicate:  a  function  that  returns true or false. The predicate is invoked just as for forEach   and map  . If the return value is true, or a value that converts to true, then the element passed to the predicate is a member of the subset and is added to the array that will become the return value:  a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]; a.filter function x  { return x   [2,1] a.filter function x,i  { return i%2==0 } ;    => [5,3,1]  every   and some   The every   and some   methods are array predicates: they ap- ply a predicate function you specify to the elements of the array, and then return true or false. The every   method is like the mathematical “for all” quanti- fier ∀: it returns true if and only if your predicate function re- turns true for all elements in the array:  a = [1,2,3,4,5];    Are all values less than 10? a.every function x  { return x   true    Are all valeus even? a.every function x  { return x%2 === 0; }     => false  The  some    method  is  like  the  mathematical  “there  exists” quantifier ∃: it returns true if there exists at least one element in the array for which the predicate returns true, and returns  104  Chapter 6: Arrays   false if and only if the predicate returns false for all elements of the array:  a = [1,2,3,4,5];    Does a have any even numbers? a.some function x  { return x%2===0; }     => true     Does a have any elements that are not numbers? a.some isNaN                                => false  Note that both every   and some   stop iterating array elements as  soon  as  they  know  what  value  to  return.  Note  also  that every   returns true and some returns false when invoked on an empty array.  reduce  , reduceRight   The  reduce    and  reduceRight    methods  combine  the  ele- ments of an array, using the function you specify, to produce a single value. This is a common operation in functional pro- gramming and also goes by the names “inject” and “fold.” Ex- amples help illustrate how it works:  var a = [1,2,3,4,5]    Compute the sume of the elements a.reduce function x,y  { return x+y }, 0 ;    => 15    Compute the product of the elements a.reduce function x,y  { return x*y }, 1 ;    => 120    Compute the largest element a.reduce function x,y  { return  x>y ?x:y; } ;    => 5  reduce   takes two arguments. The first is the function that performs the reduction operation. The task of this reduction function is to somehow combine or reduce two values into a single value, and to return that reduced value. In the examples above, the functions combine two values by adding them, mul- tiplying them, and choosing the largest. The second  optional  argument is an initial value to pass to the function.  Functions used with reduce   are different than the functions used with forEach   and map  . The familiar value, index, and array values are passed as the second, third, and fourth argu- ments. The first argument is the accumulated result of the re- duction  so  far.  On  the  first  call  to  the  function,  this  first  ECMAScript 5 Array Methods   105   argument is the initial value you passed as the second argument to reduce  . On subsequent calls, it is the value returned by the previous invocation of the function. In the first example above, the reduction function is first called with arguments 0 and 1. It adds these and returns 1. It is then called again with argu- ments 1 and 2 and it returns 3. Next it computes 3+3=6, then 6+4=10, and finally 10+5=15. This final value, 15, becomes the return value of reduce  . You may have noticed that the third call to reduce   above has only a single argument: there is no initial value specified. When you invoke reduce   like this with no initial value, it uses the first element of the array as the initial value. This means that the first call to the reduction function will have the first and second array elements as its first and second arguments. In the sum and product examples above, we could have omitted the initial value argument.  reduceRight   works just like reduce  , except that it processes the  array  from  highest  index  to  lowest   right-to-left ,  rather than from lowest to highest.  indexOf   and lastIndexOf   indexOf   and lastIndexOf   search an array for an element with a specified value, and return the index of the first such element found, or –1 if none is found. indexOf   searches the array from beginning to end, and lastIndexOf   searches from end to beginning:  a = [0,1,2,1,0]; a.indexOf 1           => 1: a[1] is 1 a.lastIndexOf 1       => 3: a[3] is 1 a.indexOf 3           => -1: no element has value 3  Unlike the other methods described in this section, indexOf   and lastIndexOf   do not take a function argument. The first argument is the value to search for. The second argument is optional:  it  specifies  the  array  index  at  which  to  begin  the search. If this argument is omitted, indexOf   starts at the be- ginning and lastIndexOf   starts at the end. Negative values  106  Chapter 6: Arrays   are allowed for the second argument and are treated as an offset from the end of the array.  Array Type We’ve seen throughout this chapter that arrays are objects with some special behavior. Given an unknown object, it is often useful to be able to determine whether it is an array or not. In ECMAScript  5,  you  can  do  this  with  the  Array.isArray   function:  Array.isArray []         => true Array.isArray {}         => false  We can write an isArray   function that works in any version of JavaScript like this:  var isArray = Array.isArray  function o  {     var ts = Object.prototype.toString;     return typeof o === "object" &&         ts.call o  === "[object Array]"; };  Array-Like Objects As we’ve seen, arrays are objects that have a length property with  special  behavior.  An  “array-like”  object  is  an  ordinary JavaScript  object  that  has  numeric  properties  names  and  a length property. These “array-like” objects actually do occa- sionally appear in practice, and although you cannot directly invoke array methods on them or expect special behavior from the length property, you can still iterate through them with the same code you’d use for a true array:     An array-like object var a = {"0":"a", "1":"b", "2":"c", length:3};      Iterate through it as if it were a real array var total = 0; for var i = 0; i < a.length; i++      total += a[i];  Array-Like Objects   107   Many array algorithms work just as well with array-like objects as they do with real arrays and the JavaScript array methods are purposely defined to be generic, so that they work correctly when applied to array-like objects. Since array-like objects do not  inherit  from  Array.prototype,  you  cannot  invoke  array methods  on  them  directly.  You  can  invoke  them  indirectly using  the  Function.call  method   see  “Indirect  Invoca- tion” on page 120 , however:     An array-like object var a = {"0":"a", "1":"b", "2":"c", length:3};   Array.prototype.join.call a, "+"     => "a+b+c" Array.prototype.map.call a, function x  {      return x.toUpperCase  ; }                                    => ["A","B","C"]    Make a true array copy of a n array-like object Array.prototype.slice.call a, 0      => ["a","b","c"]  Some browsers define generic array functions directly on the Array constructor. In browsers that support them, the exam- ples above can be rewritten like this:  var a = {"0":"a", "1":"b", "2":"c", length:3}; Array.join a, "+"  Array.slice a, 0  Array.map a, function x  { return x.toUpperCase  ; }   Strings as Arrays In ECMAScript 5  and in many recent browser implementa- tions—including IE8—prior to ECMAScript 5 , strings behave like read-only arrays. Instead of accessing individual characters with the charAt   method, you can use square brackets:  var s = test; s.charAt 0        => "t" s[1]              => "e"  The typeof operator still returns “string” for strings, of course, and the Array.isArray   method returns false if you pass it a string.  108  Chapter 6: Arrays   The primary benefit of indexable strings is simply that we can replace calls to charAt   with square brackets, which are more concise and readable. The fact that strings behave like arrays also means, however, that we can apply generic array methods to them. For example:  s = "Java" Array.prototype.join.call s, " "       => "J a v a" Array.prototype.filter.call s, function x  {                               return x.match  [^aeiou]  ;    Match nonvowels     } .join ""                         => "Jv"  Strings as Arrays   109    CHAPTER 7 Functions  A function is a block of JavaScript code that is defined once but may be executed, or invoked, any number of times. You may already be familiar with the concept of a function under a name such as subroutine or procedure. JavaScript functions are par- ameterized: a function definition may include a list of identifi- ers, known as parameters, that work as local variables for the body of the function. Function invocations provide values, or  arguments, for the function’s parameters. Functions often use their argument values to compute a return value that becomes the value of the function-invocation expression. In addition to the arguments, each invocation has another value—the invo- cation context—that is the value of the this keyword. If a function is assigned to the property of an object, it is known as a method of that object. When a function is invoked on or through  an  object,  that  object  is  the  invocation  context  or this value for the function. Functions designed to initialize a newly created object are called constructors. Constructors were described in “Creating Objects” on page 76 and will be covered again in Chapter 8.  In JavaScript, functions are objects, and they can be manipu- lated by programs. JavaScript can assign functions to variables and pass them to other functions, for example. Since functions are objects, you can set properties on them, and even invoke methods on them.  111   JavaScript  function  definitions  can  be  nested  within  other functions,  and  they  have  access  to  any  variables  that  are  in scope where they are defined. This means that JavaScript func- tions are closures, and it enables important and powerful pro- gramming techniques.  Defining Functions Functions are defined with the function keyword, which can be used in a function definition expression  “Function Defini- tion”  on  page  26   or  in  a  function  declaration  statement  “function” on page 54 . In either form, function definitions begin  with  the  keyword  function  followed  by  these components:    An identifier that names the function. The name is a re- quired part of function declaration statements: it is used as the name of a variable, and the newly defined function object is assigned to the variable. For function definition expressions,  the  name  is  optional:  if  present,  the  name refers to the function object only within the body of the function itself.    A pair of parentheses around a comma-separated list of zero or more identifiers. These identifiers are the param- eter  names  for  the  function,  and  they  behave  like  local variables within the body of the function.    A pair of curly braces with zero or more JavaScript state- ments inside. These statements are the body of the func- tion: they are executed whenever the function is invoked.  Example 7-1 shows some function definitions using both state- ment and expression forms. Notice that a function defined as an expression is only useful if it is part of a larger expression, such as an assignment or invocation, that does something with the newly defined function.  112  Chapter 7: Functions   Example 7-1. Defining JavaScript functions     Print the name and value of each property of o.    Return undefined. function printprops o  {     for var p in o           console.log p + ": " + o[p] + "\n" ;  }     Compute distance between points  x1,y1  and  x2,y2 . function distance x1, y1, x2, y2  {     var dx = x2 - x1;     var dy = y2 - y1;     return Math.sqrt dx*dx + dy*dy ; }     A recursive function  one that calls itself  that    computes factorials. Recall that x! is the product of    x and all positive integers less than it. function factorial x  {     if  x <= 1  return 1;     return x * factorial x-1 ; }     This expression defines a function that sqares its    argument. Note that we assign it to a variable var square = function x  { return x*x; }     Function expressions can include names,    which is useful for recursion. var f = function fact x  {     if  x <= 1  return 1;     else return x*fact x-1 ; };     Function expressions can also be used    as arguments to other functions: data.sort function a,b  { return a-b; } ;     Function expressions are sometimes    defined and then immediately invoked: var tensquared =  function x  {return x*x;} 10  ;  Note that the function name is optional for functions defined as expressions. A function declaration statement actually de- clares a variable and assigns a function object to it. A function  Defining Functions   113   definition expression, on the other hand, does not declare a variable.  A  name  is  allowed  for  functions,  like  the  factorial function above, that need to refer to themselves. If a function definition expression includes a name, the local function scope for that function will include a binding of that name to the function object. In effect, the function name becomes a local variable  within  the  function.  Most  functions  defined  as  ex- pressions  do  not  need  names,  which  makes  their  definition more  compact.  Function  definition  expressions  are  particu- larly well suited for functions that are used only once, as in the last two examples above.  As described in “function” on page 54, function declaration statements are “hoisted” to the top of the enclosing script or the enclosing function, so that functions declared in this way may be invoked from code that appears before they are defined. This is not true for functions defined as expressions, however: in order to invoke a function, you must be able to refer to it, and you can’t refer to a function defined as an expression until it is assigned to a variable. So functions defined with expres- sions cannot be invoked before they are defined.  Notice that most, but not all, of the functions in Example 7-1 contain a return statement  “return” on page 66 . The return statement  causes  the  function  to  stop  executing  and  to return the value of its expression  if any  to the caller. If the return  statement  does  not  have  an  associated  expression,  it returns the undefined value. If a function does not contain a return  statement,  it  simply  executes  each  statement  in  the function body and returns the undefined value to the caller.  Nested Functions In JavaScript, functions may be nested within other functions. For example:  function hypotenuse a, b  {     function square x  { return x*x; }     return Math.sqrt square a  + square b  ; }  114  Chapter 7: Functions   The interesting thing about nested functions is their variable scoping rules: they can access the parameters and variables of the function  or functions  they are nested within. In the code above, for example, the inner function square   can read and write  the  parameters  a  and  b  defined  by  the  outer  function hypotenuse  .  These  scope  rules  for  nested  functions  are very  important,  and  we’ll  consider  them  again  in  “Clo- sures” on page 125.  As noted in “function” on page 54, function declaration state- ments are not true statements, and the ECMAScript specifica- tion only allows them as top-level statements. They can appear in global code, or within other functions, but they cannot ap- pear  inside  of  loops,  conditionals,  or  try catch finally  or with statements. Note that this restriction applies only to func- tions declared as statements. Function definition expressions may appear anywhere in your JavaScript code.  Invoking Functions The JavaScript code that makes up the body of a function is not executed when the function is defined but when it is in- voked. JavaScript functions can be invoked in four ways:    as functions,   as methods,   as constructors, and   indirectly through their call   and apply   methods.  Function Invocation Functions are invoked as functions or as methods with an in- vocation expression  “Invocation” on page 27 . An invocation expression consists of a function expression that evaluates to a function object followed by an open parenthesis, a comma- separated list of zero or more argument expressions, and a close parenthesis.  If  the  function  expression  is  a  property-access expression—if the function is the property of an object or an  Invoking Functions   115   element of an array—then it is a method invocation expression. That case will be explained below. The following code includes a number of regular function invocation expressions: printprops {x:1} ;                                  var total = distance 0,0,2,1  + distance 2,1,3,5 ;  var probability = factorial 5  factorial 13 ;  In an invocation, each argument expression  the ones between the parentheses  is evaluated, and the resulting values become the arguments to the function. These values are assigned to the parameters named in the function definition. In the body of the function,  a  reference  to  a  parameter  evaluates  to  the  corre- sponding argument value.  For regular function invocation, the return value of the func- tion  becomes  the  value  of  the  invocation  expression.  If  the function returns because the interpreter reaches the end, the return value is undefined. If the function returns because the interpreter executes a return, the return value is the value of the  expression  that  follows  the  return  or  undefined  if  the return statement has no value. For  function  invocation  in  ECMAScript  3  and  nonstrict ECMAScript 5, the invocation context  the this value  is the global object. In strict mode, however, the invocation context is undefined. Functions written to be invoked as functions do not typically use the this keyword at all. It can be used, however, to deter- mine whether strict mode is in effect:     Define and invoke a function to determine    if we're in strict mode. var strict =  function   { return !this; }   ;  Method Invocation A method is nothing more than a JavaScript function that is stored in a property of an object. If you have a function f and an object o, you can define a method named m of o with the following line:  116  Chapter 7: Functions   o.m = f;  o.m  ;  o.m x, y ;  Having defined the method m   of the object o, invoke it like this:  Or, if m   expects two arguments, you might invoke it like this:  The code above is an invocation expression: it includes a func- tion expression o.m and two argument expressions, x and y. The function expression is itself a property access expression  “Property Access” on page 26 , and this means that the func- tion is invoked as a method rather than as a regular function.  The arguments and return value of a method invocation are handled exactly as described above for regular function invo- cation. Method invocations differ from function invocations in one important way, however: the invocation context. Property access expressions consist of two parts: an object  in this case o  and a property name  m . In a method invocation expression like this, the object o becomes the invocation context, and the function body can refer to that object by using the keyword this. Here is a concrete example:  var calculator = {     An object literal     operand1: 1,     operand2: 1,     add: function   {            The this keyword refers to this object.         this.result = this.operand1 + this.operand2;     } }; calculator.add  ;    A method invocation to compute 1+1. calculator.result    => 2  Most  method  invocations  use  the  dot  notation  for  property access, but property access expressions that use square brack- ets  also  cause  method  invocation.  The  following  are  both method invocations, for example:  o["m"] x,y ;    Another way to write o.m x,y . a = [function x  { return x+1 }]; a[0] z          Also a method invocation  Invoking Functions   117   Method invocations may also involve more complex property access expressions:     Invoke toUpperCase   method on customer.surname customer.surname.toUpperCase  ;     Invoke method m   on return value of f   f  .m  ;  Note that this is a keyword, not a variable or property name. JavaScript syntax does not allow you to assign a value to this. Unlike variables, the this keyword does not have a scope, and nested functions do not inherit the this value of the containing function. If a nested function is invoked as a method, its this value is the object it was invoked on. If a nested function is invoked as a function, its this value will be either the global object  nonstrict mode  or undefined  strict mode . It is a com- mon mistake to assume that a nested function invoked as a function can use this to obtain the invocation context of the outer function. If you want to access the this value of the outer function, you need to store that value into a variable that is in scope for the inner function. It is common to use the variable self for this purpose. For example:  var o = {                    An object o.     m: function   {          Method m of the object.         var self = this;     Save the this value          console.log this === o ;    Prints "true"         f  ;                 Now call nested function          function f   {            console.log this === o ;    prints "false"            console.log self === o ;    prints "true"         }     } }; o.m  ;    Invoke the method m on the object o.  Constructor Invocation If a function or method invocation is preceded by the keyword new, then it is a constructor invocation.  Constructor invoca- tions  were  introduced  in  “Initializers”  on  page  24  and  118  Chapter 7: Functions   “Creating Objects with new” on page 76, and constructors will be covered in more detail in Chapter 8.  Constructor invoca- tions differ from regular function and method invocations in their handling of arguments, invocation context, and return value.  If a constructor invocation includes an argument list in paren- theses, those argument expressions are evaluated and passed to the function in the same way they would be for function and method invocations. But if a constructor has no parameters, then JavaScript constructor invocation syntax allows the ar- gument list and parentheses to be omitted entirely. You can always omit a pair of empty parentheses in a constructor in- vocation  and  the  following  two  lines,  for  example,  are equivalent:  var o = new Object  ; var o = new Object;  A constructor invocation creates a new, empty object that in- herits  from  the  prototype  property  of  the  constructor.  Con- structor  functions  are  intended  to  initialize  objects  and  this newly created object is used as the invocation context, so the constructor  function  can  refer  to  it  with  the  this  keyword. Note that the new object is used as the invocation context even if the constructor invocation looks like a method invocation. That is, in the expression new o.m  , o is not used as the invo- cation context.  Constructor  functions  do  not  normally  use  the  return  key- word. They typically initialize the new object and then return implicitly when they reach the end of their body. In this case, the new object is the value of the constructor invocation ex- pression. If, however, a constructor explicitly used the return statement to return an object, then that object becomes the value  of  the  invocation  expression.  If  the  constructor  uses return  with  no  value,  or  if  it  returns  a  primitive  value,  that return value is ignored and the new object is used as the value of the invocation.  Invoking Functions   119   Indirect Invocation JavaScript functions are objects and like all JavaScript objects, they  have  methods.  Two  of  these  methods,  call    and apply  , invoke the function indirectly. The first argument to both call   and apply   is the object on which the function is to be invoked; this argument is the invocation context and be- comes the value of the this keyword within the body of the function. To invoke the function f   as a method of the object o   passing  no  arguments ,  you  could  use  either  call    or apply  :  f.call o ; f.apply o ;  Either of the lines of code above are similar to the following  which assume that o does not already have a property named m :  o.m = f;        Make f a temporary method of o. o.m  ;          Invoke it, passing no arguments. delete o.m;     Remove the temporary method.  In ECMAScript 5 strict mode, the first argument to call   or apply   becomes the value of this, even if it is a primitive value or null or undefined. In ECMAScript 3 and nonstrict mode, a value of null or undefined is replaced with the global object and a primitive value is replaced with the corresponding wrap- per object.  Any arguments to call   after the first invocation context ar- gument are the values that are passed to the function that is invoked. For example, to pass two numbers to the function f   and invoke it as if it were a method of the object o, you could use code like this:  The apply   method is like the call   method, except that the arguments to be passed to the function are specified as an array:  f.call o, 1, 2 ;  f.apply o, [1,2] ;  120  Chapter 7: Functions   If a function is defined to accept an arbitrary number of argu- ments, the apply   method allows you to invoke that function on the contents of an array of arbitrary length. For example, to find the largest number in an array of numbers, you could use the apply   method to pass the elements of the array to the Math.max   function:  var biggest = Math.max.apply Math, array_of_numbers ;  Note that apply   works with array-like objects as well as true arrays. In particular, you can invoke a function with the same arguments  as  the  current  function  by  passing  the  arguments array  see “Variable-Length Argument Lists: The Arguments Object” on page 122  directly to apply  . The following code demonstrates:     Replace the method named m of the object o with a    version that logs messages before and after invoking    the original method. function trace o, m  {     var original = o[m];     Remember original method.     o[m] = function   {      Now define the new method.         console.log new Date  , "Entering:", m ;    Log              Invoke the original method         var result = original.apply this, arguments ;          console.log new Date  , "Exiting:", m ;     Log            Return the result of the original method         return result;      }; }  This trace   function is passed an object and a method name. It  replaces  the  specified  method  with  a  new  method  that “wraps” additional functionality around the original method. This kind of dynamic alteration of existing methods is some- times called “monkey-patching.”  Function Arguments and Parameters JavaScript function definitions do not specify an expected type for the function parameters, and function invocations do not do any type checking on the argument values you pass. In fact,  Function Arguments and Parameters   121   JavaScript function invocations do not even check the number of  arguments  being  passed.  The  subsections  that  follow  de- scribe what happens when a function is invoked with fewer arguments than declared parameters or with more arguments than declared parameters.  Optional Parameters When  a  function  is  invoked  with  fewer  arguments  than  de- clared  parameters,  the  additional  parameters  are  set  to  the undefined value. It is often useful to write functions so that some arguments are optional and may be omitted when the function is invoked. To do this, you must be able to assign a reasonable default value to parameters that are omitted. Here is an example:     Append the names of the enumerable properties of    object o to the array a, and return a.  If a is    omitted, create and return a new array. function names o,  * optional *  a  {     if  a === undefined      If a was not specified         a = [];              use a new array.     for var property in o  a.push property ;     return a; }     This function can be invoked with 1 or 2 arguments: var a = names o ;    Get o's properties in a new array names p,a ;          Append p's properties to that array. Instead of using an if statement in the first line of this function, you  could  use   “Logical  Expres- the    operator  sions” on page 39  in this idiomatic way:  a = a  [];  Variable-Length Argument Lists: The Arguments Object When a function is invoked with more argument values than there are parameter names, there is no way to directly refer to the unnamed values. The Arguments object provides a solution  122  Chapter 7: Functions   to this problem. Within the body of a function, the identifier arguments refers to the Arguments object for that invocation. The Arguments object is an array-like object  see “Array-Like Objects” on page 107  that allows the argument values passed to the function to be retrieved by number, rather than by name.  Suppose you define a function f that expects to be passed one argument, x. If you invoke this function with two arguments, the first argument is accessible within the function by the pa- rameter name x or as arguments[0]. The second argument is accessible only as arguments[1]. Furthermore, arguments has a length property that specifies the number of elements it con- tains. Thus, within the body of the function f, invoked with two arguments, arguments.length has the value 2. One important use of the Arguments object is to write func- tions that operate on any number of arguments. The following function accepts any number of numeric arguments and re- turns the value of the largest argument it is passed  see also the built-in function Math.max  , which behaves the same way :  function max  * ... *   {     var max = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;        Look for and remember the largest argument     for var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++          if  arguments[i] > max  max = arguments[i];        Return the biggest     return max;  } var largest = max 10, 100, 2, 4, 10000, 6 ;     => 10000  Functions like this one that can accept any number of argu- ments are called variadic functions, variable arity functions, or  varargs  functions.  This  book  uses  the  most  colloquial  term, varargs, which dates to the early days of the C programming language.  Note that varargs functions need not allow invocations with zero  arguments.  It  is  perfectly  reasonable  to  use  the  argu ments[] object to write functions that expect some fixed num- ber of named and required arguments followed by an arbitrary number of unnamed optional arguments.  Function Arguments and Parameters   123   Functions as Namespaces Recall from “Variable Declaration” on page 19 that JavaScript has function scope: variables declared within a function are visible throughout the function  including within nested func- tions  but do not exist outside of the function. Variables de- clared outside of a function are global variables and are visible throughout your JavaScript program. JavaScript does not de- fine any way to declare variables that are hidden within a single block of code, and for this reason, it is sometimes useful to define a function simply to act as a temporary namespace in which you can define variables without polluting the global namespace.  Suppose, for example, you have a module of JavaScript code that you want to use in a number of different JavaScript pro- grams  or, for client-side JavaScript, on a number of different web  pages .  Assume  that  this  code,  like  most  code,  defines variables to store the intermediate results of its computation. The problem is that since this module will be used in many different programs, you don’t know whether the variables it creates will conflict with variables used by the programs that import it. The solution, of course, is to put the code into a function and then invoke the function. This way, variables that would have been global become local to the function:  function mymodule   {      Module code goes here.      Any variables used by the module are local to this      function and do not clutter the global namespace. } mymodule  ;     But don't forget to invoke the function!  This code defines only a single global variable: the function name “mymodule.” If defining even a single property is too much, you can define and invoke an anonymous function in a single expression:   function   {     mymodule as an unnamed expression      Module code goes here. }   ;             end the function and invoke it.  124  Chapter 7: Functions   This technique of defining and invoking a function in a single expression is used frequently enough that it has become id- iomatic. Note the use of parentheses in the code above. The open parenthesis before function is required because without it, the JavaScript interpreter tries to parse the function keyword as a function declaration statement. With the parenthesis, the interpreter  correctly  recognizes  this  as  a  function  definition expression. It is idiomatic to use the parentheses, even when they are not required, around a function that is to be invoked immediately after being defined.  Closures Like  most  modern  programming  languages,  JavaScript  uses lexical scoping. This means that functions are executed using the variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not the variable scope that is in effect when they are invoked. This combination of a function object and the scope  a set of variable bindings  in which it was defined is known as a clo- sure, and closures become interesting in JavaScript when nes- ted functions are involved. There are a number of powerful programming techniques that involve this kind of nested func- tion closures, and their use has become common in modern JavaScript programming. Closures can be confusing when you first encounter them, but it is important that you understand them well enough to use them comfortably.  The first step to understanding closures is to review the lexical scoping  rules  for  nested  functions.  Consider  the  following code:  var scope = "global scope";           A global variable function checkscope   {     var scope = "local scope";        A local variable     function f   { return scope; }      return f  ; } checkscope          => "local scope"  Closures   125   The checkscope   function declares a local variable and then defines and invokes a function that returns the value of that variable.  It  should  be  clear  to  you  why  the  call  to  check scope   returns “local scope.” Now let’s change the code just slightly. Can you tell what this code will return?  var scope = "global scope";           A global variable function checkscope   {     var scope = "local scope";        A local variable     function f   { return scope; }     return f; } checkscope          What does this return?  In this code, a pair of parentheses has moved from inside check scope   to outside of it. Instead of invoking the nested function and returning its result, checkscope   now just returns the nes- ted function object itself. What happens when we invoke that nested function  with the second pair of parentheses in the last line of code  outside of the function in which it was defined?  Remember the fundamental rule of lexical scoping: JavaScript functions are executed using the scope chain that was in effect when they were defined. The nested function f   was defined under a scope chain in which the variable scope was bound to the value “local scope.” That binding is still in effect when f is executed, wherever it is executed from. So the last line of code above returns “local scope,” not “global scope.” This, in a nut- shell, is the surprising and powerful nature of closures: they capture the local variable  and parameter  bindings of the outer function within which they are defined.  Closures capture the local variables of a single function invo- cation and can use those variables as private state. The follow- ing code uses a closure in this way:  var uniqueInteger =  function   {    Define and invoke     var counter = 0;     Private state of function below     return function   { return counter++; }; }   ;  In order to understand this code, you have to read it carefully. At first glance, the first line of code looks like it is assigning a  126  Chapter 7: Functions   function  to  the  variable  uniqueInteger.  In  fact,  the  code  is defining and invoking  as hinted by the open parenthesis on the first line  a function, so it is the return value of the function that is being assigned to uniqueInteger. Now, if we study the body of the function, we see that its return value is another function. It is this nested function object that gets assigned to uniqueInteger. The nested function has access to the variables in scope, and can use the counter variable defined in the outer function. Once that outer function returns, no other code can see the counter variable: the inner function has exclusive access to it. Each invocation of uniqueInteger   will return a new in- teger, and there is no way for JavaScript code to alter the in- ternal counter. Private variables like counter need not be exclusive to a single function: it is perfectly possible for two or more nested func- tions to be defined within the same outer function and share access to the same private variables. Consider the following code:  function counter   {     var n = 0;     return {         count: function   { return n++; },         reset: function   { n = 0; }     }; }  var c = counter  ,      Create two counters     d = counter  ;   c.count       => 0 d.count       => 0: they count independently c.reset       reset   and count   methods share state c.count       => 0: because we reset c d.count       => 1: d was not reset  The counter   function returns a “counter” object. This object has  two  methods:  count    returns  the  next  integer,  and reset   resets the internal state. The first thing to understand is that the two methods share access to the private variable n. The  second  thing  to  understand  is  that  each  invocation  of counter   creates a new scope chain and a new private variable.  Closures   127   So if you call counter   twice, you get two counter objects with different private variables. Calling count   or reset   on one counter object has no effect on the other.  In the example above, two functions are defined in the same scope chain and share access to the same private variable or variables. This is an important technique, but it is just as im- portant to recognize when closures inadvertently share access to a variable that they should not share. Consider the following code:     This function returns a function that always returns v function constant v  { return function   { return v; }; }     Create an array of constant functions: var funcs = []; for var i = 0; i < 10; i++  funcs[i] = constant i ;     The function at array element 5 returns the value 5. funcs[5]         => 5  When working with code like this that creates multiple clo- sures using a loop, it is a common error to try to move the loop within the function that defines the closures. Think about the following code, for example:     Return an array of functions that return 0-9 function constfuncs   {     var funcs = [];     for var i = 0; i < 10; i++          funcs[i] = function   { return i; };     return funcs; }  var funcs = constfuncs  ; funcs[5]         What does this return?  The code above creates 10 closures, and stores them in an ar- ray. The closures are all defined within the same invocation of the function, so they share access to the variable i. When con stfuncs   returns, the value of the variable i is 10, and all 10 closures  share  this  value.  Therefore,  all  the  functions  in  the returned array of functions return the same value, which is not what we wanted at all. It is important to remember that the  128  Chapter 7: Functions   scope chain associated with a closure is “live.” Nested func- tions do not make private copies of the scope or make static snapshots of the variable bindings.  Another  thing  to  remember  when  writing  closures  is  that this is a JavaScript keyword, not a variable. As discussed ear- lier, every function invocation has a this value, and a closure cannot access the this value of its outer function unless the outer function has saved that value into a variable:  var self = this;    for use by nested funcs.  The arguments binding is similar. This is not a language key- word, but it is automatically declared for every function invo- cation. Since a closure has its own binding for  arguments, it cannot access the outer function’s arguments array unless the outer function has saved that array into a variable by a different name:  var outerArguments = arguments;    For nested funcs  Function Properties, Methods, and Constructor We’ve seen that functions are values in JavaScript programs. The  typeof  operator  returns  the  string  “function”  when  ap- plied to a function, but functions are really a specialized kind of JavaScript object. Since functions are objects, they can have properties and methods, just like any other object. There is even a Function   constructor to create new function objects. The call   and apply   methods of function objects were cov- ered in “Indirect Invocation” on page 120, and the subsections that follow document the remaining function properties and methods and the Function   constructor.  The length Property Within the body of a function, arguments.length specifies the number of arguments that were passed to the function. The length property of a function itself, however, has a different  Function Properties, Methods, and Constructor   129   meaning. This read-only property returns the arity of the func- tion—the number of parameters it declares in its parameter list, which is usually the number of arguments that the function expects.  The prototype Property Every function has a prototype property that refers to an object known as the prototype object. Every function has a different prototype object. When a function is used as a constructor, the newly  created  object  inherits  properties  from  the  prototype object. Prototypes and the prototype property were discussed in  “Prototypes”  on  page  77  and  will  be  covered  again  in Chapter 8.  The bind   Method The bind   method was added in ECMAScript 5, but it is easy to simulate in ECMAScript 3. As its name implies, the primary purpose of bind   is to bind a function to an object. When you invoke the bind   method on a function f and pass an object o, the method returns a new function. Invoking the new func- tion  as a function  invokes the original function f as a method of o. Any arguments you pass to the new function are passed to the original function. For example:    This function needs to be bound function f y  { return this.x + y; }  var o = { x : 1 };     An object we'll bind to var g = f.bind o ;     Calling g x  invokes o.f x  g 2                    => 3  It is easy to accomplish this kind of binding with code like the following:     Return a function that invokes f as a method of o,    passing all its arguments. function bind f, o  {        Use the bind method, if there is one     if  f.bind  return f.bind o ;     else return function   {            Otherwise, bind it like this  130  Chapter 7: Functions           return f.apply o, arguments ;     }; }  The ECMAScript 5 bind   method does more than just bind a function to an object. It also performs partial application: any arguments you pass to bind   after the first are bound along with the this value. Partial application is a common technique in functional programming and is sometimes called currying. Here  is  an  example  of  the  bind    method  used  for  partial application:  var sum = function x,y  { return x + y };     Create a new function like sum, but with the this    value bound to null and the 1st argument bound to 1.    This new function expects just one arg. var succ = sum.bind null, 1 ; succ 2     => 3: x is bound to 1, and we pass 2 for y.  The toString   Method Like  all  JavaScript  objects,  functions  have  a  toString   method. The ECMAScript spec requires this method to return a  string  that  follows  the  syntax  of  the  function  declaration statement. In practice, most  but not all  implementations of this toString   method return the complete source code for the function. Built-in functions typically return a string that includes something like “[native code]” as the function body.  The Function   Constructor Functions are usually defined using the function keyword, ei- ther in the form of a function definition statement or a function literal expression. But functions can also be defined with the Function   constructor. For example:  var f = new Function "x", "y", "return x*y;" ;  This line of code creates a new function that is more or less equivalent to a function defined with the familiar syntax:  var f = function x, y  { return x*y; }  Function Properties, Methods, and Constructor   131   The Function   constructor expects any number of string ar- guments. The last argument is the text of the function body; it can  contain  arbitrary  JavaScript  statements,  separated  from each other by semicolons. All other arguments to the construc- tor are strings that specify the parameter names for the func- tion. If you are defining a function that takes no arguments, you  simply  pass  a  single  string—the  function  body—to  the constructor.  A very important point about the Function   constructor is that the functions it creates do not use lexical scoping; instead, they are always compiled as if they were top-level functions: they can access global variables, but not any local variables.  132  Chapter 7: Functions   CHAPTER 8 Classes  JavaScript  objects  were  covered  in  Chapter  5.  That  chapter treated each object as a unique set of properties, different from every  other  object.  It  is  often  useful,  however,  to  define  a class of objects that share certain properties. Members, or in- stances, of the class have their own properties to hold or define their state, but they also have properties  typically methods  that define their behavior. This behavior is defined by the class and is shared by all instances. Imagine a class named Complex to represent and perform arithmetic on complex numbers, for example. A Complex instance would have properties to hold the real and imaginary parts  state  of the complex number. And the Complex class would define methods to perform ad- dition and multiplication  behavior  of those numbers.  In  JavaScript,  classes  are  based  on  JavaScript’s  prototype- based inheritance mechanism. If two objects inherit properties from the same prototype object, then we say that they are in- stances  of  the  same  class.  JavaScript  prototypes  and  inheri- tance were covered in “Prototypes” on page 77 and “Property Inheritance” on page 80, and you must be familiar with the material  in  those  sections  to  understand  this  chapter. This  chapter  covers  prototypes  in  “Classes  and  Proto- types” on page 134.  If two objects inherit from the same prototype, this typically  but  not  necessarily   means  that  they  were  created  and  133   initialized by the same constructor function. Constructors have been covered in “Initializers” on page 24, “Creating Objects with  new”  on  page  76,  and  “Constructor  Invoca- tion” on page 118, and this chapter has more in “Classes and Constructors” on page 136.  If you’re familiar with strongly-typed object-oriented program- ming languages like Java or C++, you’ll notice that JavaScript classes  are  quite  different  from  classes  in  those  languages. There  are  some  syntactic  similarities,  and  you  can  emulate many features of “classical” classes in JavaScript, but it is best to understand up front that JavaScript’s classes and prototype- based inheritance mechanism are substantially different from the  classes  and  class-based  inheritance  mechanism  of  Java and  Java- Script”  on  page  141  demonstrates  classical  classes  in  Java- Script.  One  of  the  important  features  of  JavaScript  classes is  that  they  are  dynamically  extendable.  “Augmenting Classes” on page 146 explains how to do this.  languages.  “Java-Style  Classes   similar   in   Classes and Prototypes In JavaScript, a class is a set of objects that inherit properties from the same prototype object. The prototype object, there- fore, is the central feature of a class. In Example 5-1 we defined an inherit   function that returns a newly created object that inherits from a specified prototype object. In this chapter we’ll use the built-in ES5 function Object.create   instead of the more portable inherit   utility function. If we define a proto- type object, and then use Object.create   to create objects that inherit from it, we have defined a JavaScript class. Usually, the instances of a class require further initialization, and it is com- mon to define a function that creates and initializes the new object. Example 8-1 demonstrates this: it defines a prototype object for a class that represents a range of values and also de- fines a “factory” function that creates and initializes a new in- stance of the class.  134  Chapter 8: Classes   Example 8-1. A simple JavaScript class     range.js: A class representing a range of values.       This is a factory function that returns a new range object. function range from, to  {        Use Object.create   to create an object that inherits        from the prototype object defined below. The prototype        is stored as a property of this function, and defines        the shared methods  behavior  for all range objects.     var r = Object.create range.methods ;          Save the start and end points  state  of the object.        They are noninherited properties unique to this object.     r.from = from;     r.to = to;         Finally return the new object     return r; }     This prototype object defines methods inherited by all    range objects. range.methods = {        Return true if x is in the range, false otherwise     includes: function x  {         return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;     },        Invoke f once for each integer in the range.        This method works only for numeric ranges.     foreach: function f  {         for var x=Math.ceil this.from ; x <= this.to; x++              f x ;     },        Return a string representation of the range     toString: function   {         return " " + this.from + "..." + this.to + " ";     } };     Here are example uses of a range object. var r = range 1,3 ;         Create a range object r.includes 2 ;              => true: 2 is in the range r.foreach console.log ;     Prints 1 2 3 console.log r ;             Prints  1...3   Classes and Prototypes   135   There  are  a  few  things  worth  noting  in  the  code  of  Exam- ple 8-1. This code defines a factory function range   for creat- ing new range objects. Notice that we use a property of this range   function, range.methods, as a convenient place to store the prototype object that defines the class. There is nothing special or idiomatic about putting the prototype object here. Second, notice that the range   function defines from and to properties on each range object. These are the unshared, non- inherited properties that define the unique state of each indi- vidual range object. Finally, notice that the shared, inherited methods  defined  in  range.methods  all  use  these  from  and  to properties, and in order to refer to them, they use the this key- word to refer to the object through which they were invoked. This use of this is a fundamental characteristic of the methods of any class.  Classes and Constructors Example 8-1 demonstrates one way to define a JavaScript class. It is not the idiomatic way to do so, however, because it did not define a constructor. A constructor is a function designed for the initialization of newly created objects. Constructors are invoked using the new keyword as described in “Constructor Invocation” on page 118. Constructor invocations using new automatically create the new object, so the constructor itself only needs to initialize the state of that new object. The critical feature of constructor invocations is that the prototype prop- erty of the constructor function is used as the prototype of the new object. This means that all objects created with the same constructor  inherit  from  the  same  object  and  are  therefore members of the same class. Example 8-2 shows how we could alter the Range class of Example 8-1 to use a constructor func- tion instead of a factory function:  Example 8-2. A Range class using a constructor     range2.js: Another class representing a range of values.       This is a constructor function that initializes new   136  Chapter 8: Classes      Range objects. Note that it does not create or return    the object. It just initializes this. function Range from, to  {        Store the start and end points  state  of this new         range object. These are noninherited properties that        are unique to this object.     this.from = from;     this.to = to; }     All Range objects inherit from this object.    Note that the property name must be "prototype". Range.prototype = {        Return true if x is in the range, false otherwise     includes: function x  {         return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;     },        Invoke f once for each integer in the range.     foreach: function f  {         for var x=Math.ceil this.from ; x <= this.to; x++              f x ;     },        Return a string representation of the range     toString: function   {         return " " + this.from + "..." + this.to + " ";     } };     Here are example uses of a range object var r = new Range 1,3 ;      Create a range object r.includes 2 ;               => true: 2 is in the range r.foreach console.log ;      Prints 1 2 3 console.log r ;              Prints  1...3   It is worth comparing Example 8-1 and Example 8-2 carefully and noting the differences between these two techniques for defining classes. First, notice that we renamed the range   fac- tory function to Range   when we converted it to a constructor. This is a very common coding convention: constructor func- tions define, in a sense, classes, and classes have names that begin with capital letters. Regular functions and methods have names that begin with lowercase letters.  Next, notice that the Range   constructor is invoked  at the end of the example  with the new keyword while the range   factory  Classes and Constructors   137   function  was  invoked  without  it.  Example  8-1  uses  regular function invocation  “Function Invocation” on page 115  to create the new object and Example 8-2 uses constructor invo- cation  “Constructor Invocation” on page 118 . Because the Range   constructor is invoked with new, it does not have to call Object.create   or take any action to create a new object. The new object is automatically created before the constructor is called, and it is accessible as the this value. The Range   con- structor merely has to initialize this. Constructors do not even have to return the newly created object. Constructor invoca- tion automatically creates a new object, invokes the construc- tor as a method of that object, and returns the new object.  Another critical difference between Example 8-1 and Exam- ple 8-2 is the way the prototype object is named. In the first example, the prototype was range.methods. This was a conve- nient and descriptive name, but arbitrary. In the second ex- ample,  the  prototype  is  Range.prototype,  and  this  name  is mandatory.  An  invocation  of  the  Range    constructor  auto- matically  uses  Range.prototype  as  the  prototype  of  the  new Range object.  Finally, also note the things that do not change between Ex- ample 8-1 and Example 8-2: the range methods are defined and invoked in the same way for both classes.  Constructors and Class Identity As we’ve seen, the prototype object is fundamental to the iden- tity of a class: two objects are instances of the same class if and only if they inherit from the same prototype object. The con- structor function that initializes the state of a new object is not fundamental: two constructor functions may have prototype properties that point to the same prototype object. Then both constructors can be used to create instances of the same class.  Even through constructors are not as fundamental as proto- types, the constructor serves as the public face of a class. Most obviously,  the  name  of  the  constructor  function  is  usually adopted as the name of the class. We say, for example, that the  138  Chapter 8: Classes   Range   constructor creates Range objects. More fundamen- tally, however, constructors are used with the instanceof op- erator when testing objects for membership in a class. If we have an object r and want to know if it is a Range object, we can write:     true if r inherits from Range.prototype r instanceof Range  The instanceof operator does not actually check whether r was initialized by the Range constructor. It checks whether it inher- its from Range.prototype. Nevertheless, the instanceof syntax reinforces the use of constructors as the public identity of a class.  We’ll  see  the  instanceof  operator  again  later  in  this chapter.  The constructor Property In Example 8-2 we set Range.prototype to a new object that contained the methods for our class. Although it was conve- nient to express those methods as properties of a single object literal, it was not actually necessary to create a new object. Any JavaScript  function  can  be  used  as  a  constructor,  and  con- structor  invocations  need  a  prototype  property.  Therefore, every JavaScript function automatically has a prototype prop- erty. The value of this property is an object that has a single nonenumerable  constructor  property.  The  value  of  the  con structor property is the function object:     F.prototype.constructor === F for any function F. var F = function   {};    A function object.  var p = F.prototype;      Its prototype object. var c = p.constructor;    The prototype's function c === F                   => true:  The  existence  of  this  predefined  prototype  object  with  its constructor property means that objects typically inherit a con structor property that refers to their constructor. Since con- structors serve as the public identity of a class, this constructor property gives the class of an object:  Classes and Constructors   139   var o = new F  ;       Create an object o of class F o.constructor === F    => true  Figure 8-1 illustrates this relationship between the constructor function, its prototype object, the back reference from the pro- totype to the constructor, and the instances created with the constructor.  Figure 8-1. A constructor function, its prototype, and instances  Notice that Figure 8-1 uses our Range   constructor as an ex- ample.  In  fact,  however,  the  Range  class  defined  in  Exam- ple 8-2 overwrites the predefined Range.prototype object with an object of its own. And the new prototype object it defines does  not  have  a  constructor  property.  So  instances  of  the Range class, as defined, do not have a constructor property. We can remedy this problem by explicitly adding a constructor to the prototype:  Range.prototype = {     constructor: Range,    Explicitly set the constructor     includes: function x  {         return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;     },        etc... };  Another common technique is to use the predefined prototype object with its constructor property, and add methods to it one at a time:     Extend the predefined Range.prototype object so we    don't overwrite Range.prototype.constructor. Range.prototype.includes = function x  {     return this.from<=x && x<=this.to;  140  Chapter 8: Classes   }; Range.prototype.foreach = function f  {     for var x=Math.ceil this.from ; x <= this.to; x++          f x ; }; Range.prototype.toString = function   {     return " " + this.from + "..." + this.to + " "; };  Java-Style Classes in JavaScript If you have programmed in Java or a similar strongly-typed object-oriented language, you may be accustomed to thinking about four kinds of class members:  Instance fields  Instance methods  Class fields  Class methods  These  are  the  per-instance  properties  or  variables  that hold the state of individual objects.  These are methods that are shared by all instances of the class that are invoked through individual instances.  These are properties or variables associated with the class rather than the instances of the class.  These are methods that are associated with the class rather than with instances.  One way JavaScript differs from Java is that its functions are values, and there is no hard distinction between methods and fields. If the value of a property is a function, that property defines a method; otherwise, it is just an ordinary property or “field.” Despite this difference, we can simulate each of Java’s four categories of class members in JavaScript. In JavaScript, there are three different objects involved in any class definition  see Figure 8-1 , and the properties of these three objects act like different kinds of class members:  Java-Style Classes in JavaScript   141   Constructor object  As we’ve noted, the constructor function  an object  de- fines a name for a JavaScript class. Properties you add to this  constructor  object  serve  as  class  fields  and  class methods.  Prototype object  The properties of this object are inherited by all instances of  the  class,  and  properties  whose  values  are  functions behave like instance methods of the class.  Instance object  Each instance of a class is an object in its own right, and properties defined directly on an instance are not shared by any other instances. Nonfunction properties defined on instances behave as the instance fields of the class.  We can reduce the process of class definition in JavaScript to a three-step algorithm. First, write a constructor function that sets  instance  properties  on  new  objects.  Second,  define  in- stance  methods  on  the  prototype  object  of  the  constructor. Third, define class fields and class methods on the constructor itself.  We  can  even  implement  this  algorithm  as  a  simple defineClass   function:     A simple function for defining simple classes function defineClass constructor,    Initialization                       methods,        Instance methods                      statics         Class properties {     if  methods  {            Copy methods to the prototype         for var m in methods               constructor.prototype[m] = methods[m];     }            if  statics  {            Copy static properties to the constructor         for var s in statics              constructor[s] = statics[s];     }      return constructor; }  142  Chapter 8: Classes      This is a simple variant of our Range class var SimpleRange =     defineClass          function f,t  { this.f = f; this.t = t; },         {             includes: function x  {                 return this.f <= x && x <= this.t;             },             toString: function   {                 return this.f + "..." + this.t;             }         },         {             upto: function t  {                 return new SimpleRange 0, t ;              }         }      ;  Immutable Classes “Property Attributes” on page 87 demonstrated the ECMA- Script 5 Object.defineProperties   method for defining read- only and nonenumerable properties, and also explained that property descriptors can also be passed to Object.create. We can use these ES5 features to define classes whose instances are immutable. Example 8-3 is an immutable version of our Range class with instance methods that are nonenumerable, like the methods of built-in classes. Finally, as an interesting trick, Ex- ample 8-3 has a constructor function that works as a factory function when invoked without the new keyword.  Example 8-3. An immutable class with nonenumerable methods     This function works with or without 'new':    it is a constructor and factory function. function Range from,to  {        These are descriptors for the read-only properties.     var props = {         from: { value:from, enumerable:true },         to: { value:to, enumerable:true }     };       Immutable Classes   143       if  this instanceof Range     Invoked as a constructor         Object.defineProperties this, props ;     else                          Invoked as a factory         return Object.create Range.prototype, props ; }     Now set up the prototype with nonenumerable properties Object.defineProperties Range.prototype, {     includes: {         value: function x  {             return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;         },         writable: true, configurable: true     },     foreach: {         value: function f  {             for var x=Math.ceil this.from ; x<=this.to; x++                  f x ;         },         writable: true, configurable: true     },     toString: {         value: function   {             return " " + this.from + "..." + this.to + " ";         },         writable: true, configurable: true     } } ;  Subclasses In object-oriented programming, a class B can extend or sub- class another class A. We say that A is the superclass and B is the subclass. Instances of B inherit all the instance methods of A. The class B can define its own instance methods, some of which  may  override  methods  of  the  same  name  defined  by class A.  The key to creating subclasses in JavaScript is proper initiali- zation of the prototype object. If an object O is an instance of a class B and B is a subclass of A, then O must also inherit properties from A. We arrange this by ensuring that the pro- totype object of B inherits from the prototype object of A. Using  144  Chapter 8: Classes   Object.create     we  could  also  use  the  inherit    function from Example 5-1 , we write:     Subclass B inherits from superclass A B.prototype = Object.create A.prototype ;     But override the inherited constructor prop. B.prototype.constructor = B;  The two lines of code above are critical to creating subclasses in JavaScript. Without them, the prototype object will be an ordinary  object—an  object  that  inherits  from  Object.proto type—and this means that your class will be a subclass of Ob- ject like all classes are. It is straightforward to add these two lines to the defineClass   function above to transform it into  defineSubclass  . Example 8-4 defines a DateRange class as a subclass of Range. Date objects in JavaScript can be compared with  , so DateRange inherits the includes   and toString   methods. But it overrides the foreach   method to enumerate by days within the range. Note how the DateRange.prototype is set up, and also notice that the  DateRange   constructor invokes its superclass constructor  using the call   method  to initialize the new object.  Example 8-4. A Range subclass     A subclass of our Range class. It inherits the includes      and toString   methods, and overrides the foreach method    to make it work with dates. function DateRange from, to  {        Use the superclass constructor to initialize     Range.call this, from, to ; }     These two lines are key to subclassing. The subclass    prototype must inherit from the superclass prototype. DateRange.prototype = Object.create Range.prototype ; DateRange.prototype.constructor = DateRange;     This "static" field of the subclass holds the    number of milliseconds in one day. DateRange.DAY = 1000*60*60*24;  Subclasses   145      Invoke f once for each day in the range DateRange.prototype.foreach = function f  {     var d = this.from;      while d < this.to  {         f d ;         d = new Date d.getTime   + DateRange.DAY ;     } }  var now = new Date  ; var tomorrow = new Date now.getTime   + DateRange.DAY ; var nextweek = new Date now.getTime   + 7*DateRange.DAY ; var week = new DateRange now, nextweek ;  week.includes tomorrow        => true week.foreach function d  {    Print each day in the week     console.log d.toLocaleDateString   ; } ;  Augmenting Classes JavaScript’s  prototype-based  inheritance  mechanism  is  dy- namic: an object inherits properties from its prototype, even if the properties of the prototype change after the object is cre- ated. This means that we can augment JavaScript classes sim- ply by adding new methods to their prototype objects. Here is code that adds a method to our Range class:     Return a new range with negated endpoints Range.prototype.negate = function   {     return new Range -this.to, -this.from ; };  The  prototype  object  of  built-in  JavaScript  classes  is  also “open”  like  this,  which  means  that  we  can  add  methods  to numbers, strings, arrays, functions, and so on. Here are some examples:     Invoke the function f this many times, passing the    iteration number. E.g., to print "hello" 3 times:      var n = 3;      n.times function n  { console.log n + " hello" ; } ; Number.prototype.times = function f, context  {     var n = Number this ;  146  Chapter 8: Classes       for var i = 0; i < n; i++  f.call context, i ; };     Define the ES5 String.trim   method if it does not     exist. This method trims space from the start and end. String.prototype.trim =     String.prototype.trim  function   {         if  !this  return this;         return this.replace  ^\s+\s+$ g, "" ;     };     Return a function's name or "". If it has a name     property, use it. Otherwise, convert the function to     a string and extract the name from that.  Function.prototype.getName = function   {     return this.name          this.toString  .match  function\s* [^ ]* \   [1]; };  It  is  possible  to  add  methods  to  Object.prototype,  making them available on all objects. This is not recommended, how- ever, because prior to ECMAScript 5, there is no way to make these add-on methods nonenumerable, and if you add prop- erties to Object.prototype, those properties will be reported by all for in loops.  Augmenting Classes   147    CHAPTER 9 Regular Expressions  A  regular  expression  is  an  object  that  describes  a  pattern  of characters. The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular ex- pressions, and both String and RegExp define methods that use regular expressions to perform powerful pattern-matching and search-and-replace functions on text. This chapter begins by defining  the  syntax  that  regular  expressions  use  to  describe textual patterns. It then moves on to describe the String and RegExp methods that use regular expressions.  Describing Patterns with Regular Expressions In JavaScript, regular expressions are represented by RegExp objects. RegExp objects may be created with the RegExp   con- structor,  of  course,  but  they  are  more  often  created  using  a special literal syntax. Just as string literals are specified as char- acters within quotation marks, regular expression literals are specified  as  characters  within  a  pair  of  slash       characters. Thus, your JavaScript code may contain lines like this:  var pattern =  s$ ;  This  line  creates  a  new  RegExp  object  and  assigns  it  to  the variable pattern. This particular RegExp object matches any string  that  ends  with  the  letter  “s.”  This  regular  expression  149   could have equivalently been defined with the RegExp   con- structor like this:  var pattern = new RegExp "s$" ;  Regular-expression pattern specifications consist of a series of characters. Most characters, including all alphanumeric char- acters,  simply  describe  characters  to  be  matched  literally. Thus, the regular expression  java  matches any string that contains the substring “java.” Other characters in regular ex- pressions  are  not  matched  literally  but  have  special  signifi- cance. For example, the regular expression  s$  contains two characters. The first, “s,” matches itself literally. The second, “$,” is a special metacharacter that matches the end of a string. Thus, this regular expression matches any string that contains the letter “s” as its last character.  The  following  sections  describe  the  various  characters  and metacharacters used in JavaScript regular expressions.  Literal Characters All alphabetic characters and digits match themselves literally in regular expressions. Certain nonalphabetic characters can be  matched  literally  with  escape  sequences.  Table  9-1  lists these characters.  Table 9-1. Regular-expression literal characters  Character Alphanumeric character  Matches Itself  \0  \t  \n  \v  \f  \r  The NUL character  \u0000  Tab  \u0009  Newline  \u000A  Vertical tab  \u000B  Form feed  \u000C  Carriage return  \u000D   150  Chapter 9: Regular Expressions   Character \x nn  \u xxxx  \c X  Matches The Latin character specified by the hexadecimal number nn; for ex- ample, \x0A is the same as \n The Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx; for example, \u0009 is the same as \t The control character ^ X; for example, \cJ is equivalent to the newline character \n  A number of punctuation characters have special meanings in regular expressions. They are:  ^ $ . * + ? = ! :  \       [ ] { }  The meanings of these characters are discussed in the sections that follow. Some of these characters have special meaning only within certain contexts of a regular expression and are treated literally in other contexts. As a general rule, however, if you want to include any of these punctuation characters literally in a regular expression, you must precede them with a \. Other punctuation characters, such as quotation marks and @, do not have special meaning and simply match themselves literally in a regular expression.  Character Classes Individual  literal  characters  can  be  combined  into  character classes  by  placing  them  within  square  brackets.  A  character class  matches  any  one  character  that  is  contained  within  it. Thus, the regular expression  [abc]  matches any one of the letters a, b, or c. Negated character classes can also be defined; these match any character except those contained within the brackets.  A  negated  character  class  is  specified  by  placing  a caret   ^   as  the  first  character  inside  the  left  bracket.  The regexp  [^abc]  matches any one character other than a, b, or c. Character classes can use a hyphen to indicate a range of characters.  To  match  any  one  lowercase  character  from  the Latin alphabet, use  [a-z] , and to match any letter or digit from the Latin alphabet, use  [a-zA-Z0-9] . Character classes  Describing Patterns with Regular Expressions   151   work  with  Unicode  characters  as  well.  To  match  a  Cyrillic character, for example, use  [\u0400-\u04FF] . The  regular-expression  syntax  includes  shortcuts  for  a  few commonly used character classes. Table 9-2 lists these charac- ters and summarizes character-class syntax.  Table 9-2. Regular expression character classes  Character Matches  [...]  [^...]  .  \w  \W  \s  \S  \d  \D  [\b]  Any one character between the brackets. Any one character not between the brackets. Any character except newline or another Unicode line terminator. Any ASCII word character. Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Any character that is not an ASCII word character. Equivalent to [^a-zA- Z0-9_]. Any Unicode whitespace character. Any character that is not Unicode whitespace. Note that \w and \S are not the same thing. Any ASCII digit. Equivalent to [0-9]. Any character other than an ASCII digit. Equivalent to [^0-9]. A literal backspace  special case .  Note that the special character-class escapes can be used within square brackets. \s matches any whitespace character, and \d matches any digit, so   [\s\d]  matches any one whitespace character or digit.  Repetition A character or character class may be followed by additional characters  that  specify  how  many  times  those  characters should  be  matched.  Table  9-3  summarizes  the  repetition syntax.  152  Chapter 9: Regular Expressions   Table 9-3. Regular expression repetition characters  Character Meaning {n , m} {n ,} {n}  ?  +  *  Match the previous item at least n times but no more than m times. Match the previous item n or more times. Match exactly n occurrences of the previous item. Match zero or one occurrences of the previous item. That is, the previous item is optional. Equivalent to {0,1}. Match one or more occurrences of the previous item. Equivalent to {1,}. Match zero or more occurrences of the previous item. Equivalent to {0,}.  The following lines show some examples:   \d{2,4}        Between two and four digits  \w{3}\d?       Three word characters + optional digit  \s+java\s+     "java" with spaces before and after  [^ ]*          zero or more chars that are not ' '  Be careful when using the * and ? repetition characters. Since these  characters  may  match  zero  instances  of  whatever  pre- cedes them, they are allowed to match nothing. For example, the regular expression  a*  actually matches the string “bbbb” because the string contains zero occurrences of the letter a!  Nongreedy repetition The repetition characters listed in Table 9-3 match as many times as possible while still allowing any following parts of the regular  expression  to  match.  We  say  that  this  repetition  is “greedy.” It is also possible to specify that repetition should be done in a nongreedy way. Simply follow the repetition char- acter or characters with a question mark: ??, +?, *?, or even {1,5}?. For example, the regular expression  a+  matches one or more occurrences of the letter a. When applied to the string “aaa,” it matches all three letters. But  a+?  matches one or more occurrences of the letter a, matching as few characters as necessary.  When  applied  to  the  same  string,  this  pattern matches only the first letter a.  Describing Patterns with Regular Expressions   153   Alternation, Grouping, and References The  regular-expression  grammar  includes  special  characters for specifying alternatives, grouping subexpressions, and re- ferring to previous subexpressions. The  character separates alternatives. For example,  abcdef  matches the string “ab” or  the  string  “cd”  or  the  string  “ef.”  And   \d{3}[a-z]{4}  matches either three digits or four lowercase letters.  Note that alternatives are considered left to right until a match is found. If the left alternative matches, the right alternative is ignored,  even  if  it  would  have  produced  a  “better”  match. Thus, when the pattern  aab  is applied to the string “ab,” it matches only the first letter.  Parentheses have several purposes in regular expressions. One is to group separate items into a subexpression so the items can be treated as a single unit by , *, +, ?, and so on. For exam- ple,  java script ?  matches “java” followed by the optional “script.” And   abcd +ef  matches either the string “ef” or one or more repetitions of either of the strings “ab” or “cd.”  Another purpose of parentheses is to define subpatterns within the complete pattern. When a regular expression is successfully matched against a target string, you can extract the portions of the  target  string  that  matched  any  particular  parenthesized subpattern.  You’ll see how these matching substrings are ob- tained later.  For example, suppose you’re looking for one or more  lowercase  letters  followed  by  one  or  more  digits.  You might use the pattern  [a-z]+\d+ . But suppose you only care about the digits at the end of each match. If you put that part of the pattern in parentheses   [a-z]+ \d+   , you can extract the digits from any matches you find, as explained later.  A related use of parenthesized subexpressions is to allow you to refer back to a subexpression later in the same regular ex- pression. This is done by following a \ character by a digit or digits.  The  digits  refer  to  the  position  of  the  parenthesized subexpression within the regular expression. For example, \3 refers back to the third subexpression.  154  Chapter 9: Regular Expressions   A reference to a previous subexpression of a regular expression does not refer to the pattern for that subexpression but rather to the text that matched the pattern. Thus, references can be used to enforce a constraint that separate portions of a string contain exactly the same characters. For example, the follow- ing regular expression matches zero or more characters within single or double quotes. However, it does not require the open- ing and closing quotes to match  i.e., both single quotes or both double quotes :  To require the quotes to match, use a reference:   ['"][^'"]*['"]     ['"] [^'"]*\1   The \1 matches whatever the first parenthesized subexpression matched. In this example, it enforces the constraint that the closing quote match the opening quote.  It is also possible to group items in a regular expression without creating a numbered reference to those items. Instead of simply grouping the items within   and  , begin the group with  ?: and end it with  . Table 9-4. Regular expression alternation, grouping, and reference characters  Character Meaning     ...    ?:...   \ n  Alternation. Match either the subexpression to the left or the subexpression to the right. Grouping. Group items into a single unit that can be used with *, +, ?, , and so on. Also remember the characters that match this group for use with later references. Grouping only. Group items into a single unit, but do not remember the characters that match this group. Match the same characters that were matched when group number n was first matched. Groups are subexpressions within  possibly nested  paren- theses. Group numbers are assigned by counting left parentheses from left to right. Groups formed with  ?: are not numbered.  Describing Patterns with Regular Expressions   155   Specifying Match Position As  described  earlier,  many  elements  of  a  regular  expression match a single character in a string. For example, \s matches a single character of whitespace. Other regular expression el- ements match the positions between characters, instead of ac- tual characters. \b, for example, matches a word boundary— the boundary between a \w  ASCII word character  and a \W  nonword character , or the boundary between an ASCII word character and the beginning or end of a string. Elements such as \b do not specify any characters to be used in a matched string; what they do specify, however, are legal positions at which a match can occur. Sometimes these elements are called  anchors because they anchor the pattern to a specific position in the search string. The most commonly used anchor elements are ^, which ties the pattern to the beginning of the string, and $, which anchors the pattern to the end of the string. For example, to match the word “JavaScript” on a line by itself, you can use the regular expression  ^JavaScript$ . If you want to search for “Java” as a word by itself  not as a prefix, as it is in “JavaScript” , you can try the pattern  \sJava\s , which re- quires a space before and after the word. But there are two problems with this solution. First, it does not match “Java” at the beginning or the end of a string, but only if it appears with space  on  either  side.  Second,  when  this  pattern  does  find  a match, the matched string it returns has leading and trailing spaces, which is not quite what’s needed. So instead of match- ing actual space characters with \s, match  or anchor to  word boundaries  with  \b.  The  resulting  expression  is   \bJava\b . The element \B anchors the match to a location that is not a word  boundary.  Thus,  the  pattern   \B[Ss]cript   matches “JavaScript” and “postscript,” but not “script” or “Scripting.”  Table 9-5 summarizes regular-expression anchors.  156  Chapter 9: Regular Expressions   Table 9-5. Regular-expression anchor characters  Character Meaning  ^  $  \b  \B   ?=p    ?!p   Match the beginning of the string and, in multiline searches, the beginning of a line. Match the end of the string and, in multiline searches, the end of a line. Match a word boundary. That is, match the position between a \w character and a \W character or between a \w character and the beginning or end of a string.  Note, however, that [\b] matches backspace.  Match a position that is not a word boundary. A positive lookahead assertion. Require that the following characters match the pattern p, but do not include those characters in the match. A negative lookahead assertion. Require that the following characters do not match the pattern p.  Flags There is one final element of regular-expression grammar. Reg- ular-expression flags specify high-level pattern-matching rules. Unlike the rest of regular-expression syntax, flags are specified to the right of the second slash. JavaScript supports three flags. The  i  flag  specifies  that  pattern  matching  should  be  case- insensitive. The g flag specifies that pattern matching should be  global—that  is,  all  matches  within  the  searched  string should be found. The m flag performs pattern matching in mul- tiline mode. In this mode, if the string to be searched contains newlines, the ^ and $ anchors match the beginning and end of a line in addition to matching the beginning and end of a string. These flags may be specified in any combination. For example, the pattern  java$ im matches “java” as well as “Java\nis fun.” Table 9-6 summarizes these regular-expression flags. Note that you’ll see more about the g flag in the next section.  Describing Patterns with Regular Expressions   157   Table 9-6. Regular-expression flags  Character Meaning  i  g  m  Perform case-insensitive matching. Perform a global match—that is, find all matches rather than stopping after the first match. Multiline mode. ^ matches beginning of line or beginning of string, and $ matches end of line or end of string.  Matching Patterns with Regular Expressions This section discusses methods of the String and RegExp ob- jects that use regular expressions to perform pattern matching and search-and-replace operations.  String Methods for Pattern-Matching Strings support four methods that use regular expressions. The simplest is search  . This method takes a regular-expression argument and returns either the character position of the start of the first matching substring or −1 if there is no match. For example, the following call returns 4:  "JavaScript".search  script i ;  search   does not support global searches; it ignores the g flag of its regular-expression argument.  The replace   method performs a search-and-replace opera- tion. It takes a regular expression as its first argument and a replacement  string  as  its  second  argument.  It  searches  the string on which it is called for matches with the specified pat- tern. If the regular expression has the g flag set, the replace   method replaces all matches in the string with the replacement string; otherwise, it replaces only the first match it finds. If the first argument to replace   is a string rather than a regular ex- pression,  the  method  searches  for  that  string  literally  rather  158  Chapter 9: Regular Expressions   than converting it to a regular expression with the  RegExp   constructor,  as  search    does.  As  an  example,  you  can  use replace   as follows to provide uniform capitalization of the word “JavaScript” throughout a string of text: text.replace  javascript gi, "JavaScript" ;  replace    is  more  powerful  than  this,  however.  Recall  that parenthesized subexpressions of a regular expression are num- bered from left to right and that the regular expression remem- bers the text that each subexpression matches. If a $ followed by a digit appears in the replacement string, replace   replaces those two characters with the text that matches the specified subexpression. You can use this feature, for example, to replace straight quotes in a string with curly quotes, simulated with ASCII characters:     A quote is a quotation mark, followed by any number     of nonquotation-mark characters  which we remember ,     followed by another quotation mark. var quote =  " [^"]* " g;    Replace the straight quotation marks with curly quotes,    leaving the quoted text  stored in $1  unchanged. text.replace quote, '“$1”' ;  The second argument to replace   can also be a function that dynamically  computes  the  replacement  string.  If  you  pass  a function, it will be invoked once for each match. Its first argu- ment will be the text of the matched string, and its remaining arguments will be the text that matched each parenthesized subexpression within the pattern. The return value of the func- tion is used as the replacement string.  The match   method is the most general of the String regular- expression methods. It takes a regular expression as its only argument and returns an array that contains the results of the match. If the regular expression has the g flag set, the method returns an array of all matches that appear in the string. For example:  "1 plus 2 equals 3".match  \d+ g      => ["1","2","3"]  Matching Patterns with Regular Expressions   159   If the regular expression does not have the g flag set, match   does  not  do  a  global  search;  it  simply  searches  for  the  first match. However, match   returns an array even when it does not perform a global search. In this case, the first element of the array is the matching string, and any remaining elements are the substrings that matched the parenthesized subexpres- sions  of  the  regular  expression.  To  draw  a  parallel  with  the replace   method, a[n] holds the contents of $n. For example, consider parsing a URL with the following code:  var url =   \w+ :\ \  [\w.]+ \  \S*  ; var text = "Visit http:  www.example.com ~david"; var result = text.match url ; if  result != null  {     var fullurl = result[0];     the complete match     var protocol = result[1];    => "http"     var host = result[2];        => "www.example.com"     var path = result[3];        => "~david" }  The last of the regular-expression methods of the String object is split  . This method breaks the string on which it is called into an array of substrings, using the argument as a separator. For example:  "123,456,789".split "," ;     => ["123","456","789"]  The split   method can also take a regular expression as its argument. This ability makes the method more powerful. For example, you can specify a separator character that allows an arbitrary amount of whitespace on either side:  "1 , 2,3".split  \s*,\s*  ;    => ["1","2","3"]  RegExp Properties and Methods Each RegExp object has five properties. The source property contains the text of the regular expression. The global property specifies  whether  the  regular  expression  has  the  g  flag.  The ignoreCase property specifies whether the regular expression has the i flag. The multiline property specifies whether the regular  expression  has  the  m  flag.  The  final  property  is  160  Chapter 9: Regular Expressions   lastIndex, a read write integer. For patterns with the g flag, this property stores the position in the string at which the next search is to begin. It is used by the exec   and test   methods, described below.  RegExp  objects  define  two  methods  that  perform  pattern- matching operations; they behave similarly to the String meth- ods  described  earlier.  The  main  RegExp  pattern-matching method is exec  . It is similar to the String match   method described  in  “Matching  Patterns  with  Regular  Expres- sions” on page 158, except that it is a RegExp method that takes a string, rather than a String method that takes a RegExp. The exec   method executes a regular expression on the specified string. That is, it searches the string for a match. If it finds none, it returns null. If it does find one, however, it returns an array just like the array returned by the match   method for nonglo- bal searches. Element 0 of the array contains the string that matched the regular expression, and any subsequent array el- ements contain the substrings that matched any parenthesized subexpressions. Furthermore, the index property contains the character  position  at  which  the  match  occurred,  and  the input property refers to the string that was searched. Unlike the match   method, exec   returns the same kind of array whether or not the regular expression has the global g flag.  Recall  that  match    returns  an  array  of  matches  when passed a global regular expression. exec  , by contrast, always returns  a  single  match  and  provides  complete  information about that match. When exec   is called on a regular expres- sion that has the g flag, it sets the lastIndex property of the regular-expression  object  to  the  character  position  immedi- ately following the matched substring. When exec   is invoked a  second  time  for  the  same  regular  expression,  it  begins  its search  at  the  character  position  indicated  by  the  lastIndex property. If exec   does not find a match, it resets lastIndex to 0.  You can also set lastIndex at any time.  This special be- havior allows you to call  exec   repeatedly in order to loop through all the regular expression matches in a string.  Matching Patterns with Regular Expressions   161   For example:  var pattern =  Java g; var text = "JavaScript is more fun than Java!"; var result; while  result = pattern.exec text   != null  {     alert "Matched '" + result[0] + "'" +           " at position " + result.index +           "; next search at " + pattern.lastIndex ; }  The other RegExp method is test  . test   is a much simpler method than exec  . It takes a string and returns true if the string contains a match for the regular expression:  var pattern =  java i; pattern.test "JavaScript" ;     Returns true  Calling  test    is  equivalent  to  calling  exec    and  returning true if the return value of exec   is not null. Because of this equivalence, the test   method behaves the same way as the exec   method when invoked for a global regular expression: it begins searching the specified string at the position specified by lastIndex, and if it finds a match, it sets lastIndex to the position  of  the  character  immediately  following  the  match. Thus, you can loop through a string using the test   method just as you can with the exec   method.  162  Chapter 9: Regular Expressions   CHAPTER 10 Client-Side JavaScript  The first part of this book described the core JavaScript lan- guage.  We  now  move  on  to  JavaScript  as  used  within  web browsers, commonly called client-side JavaScript. Most of the examples we’ve seen so far, while legal JavaScript code, have no particular context; they are JavaScript fragments that run in no specified environment. This chapter introduces that con- text, and the chapters that follow fill in the details.  Embedding JavaScript in HTML JavaScript code can appear inline within an HTML file between   and     tags:       Your JavaScript code goes here    Example 10-1 is an HTML file that includes a simple JavaScript program. The comments explain what the program does, but the main point of this example is to demonstrate how Java- Script code is embedded within an HTML file along with, in this case, a CSS stylesheet.  Example 10-1. A simple JavaScript digital clock                    163                 Digital Clock              A script of js code    Define a function to display the current time function displayTime   {     var now = new Date  ;    Get current time        Find element with id="clock"     var elt = document.getElementById "clock" ;        Display the time in the element     elt.innerHTML = now.toLocaleTimeString  ;            And repeat in one second     setTimeout displayTime, 1000 ;                }    Start the clock when the document loads. window.onload = displayTime;                * A CSS stylesheet for the clock *  clock {         * Styles apply to element with id="clock" *    font: bold 24pt sans;     * Use a big bold font *    background: ddf;         * on a light gray background. *    padding: 10px;            * Surround it with some space *    border: solid black 2px;  * and a solid black border *    border-radius: 10px;      * with rounded corners. *  }                   Digital Clock                The     tag  can  also  be  used  with  a  src  attribute  that specifies the URL of a file containing JavaScript code. It is used like this:      A  JavaScript  file  contains  pure  JavaScript,  without    tags  or  any  other  HTML.  By  convention,  files  of  JavaScript code have names that end with .js.  A   tag with the src attribute specified behaves exactly as if the contents of the specified JavaScript file appeared di- rectly between the   and   tags. Note that the closing    tag is required in HTML documents even  164  Chapter 10: Client-Side JavaScript   when the src attribute is specified, and there is no content be- tween the   and   tags. JavaScript was the original scripting language for the Web and   elements are, by default, assumed to contain or to reference JavaScript code.   elements have a type at- tribute whose default value is “text javascript.” You can spec- ify this type explicitly if you want, but it is never necessary.  Event-Driven Programming Client-side  JavaScript  programs  are  generally  asynchronous and event-driven. When a web page loads, the scripts in that web page generally initialize some variables and register some event handler functions. These functions are then invoked by the browser when the events for which they were registered occur. A web application that wants to enable keyboard short- cuts for common actions would register an event handler for key  events,  for  example.  Even  noninteractive  programs  use events. Suppose you wanted to write a program that would analyze the structure of its document and automatically gen- erate a table of contents for the document. No event handlers for user input events are necessary, but the program would still register an onload event handler so that it would know when the document had finished loading and was ready to have a table of contents generated.  Events and event handling are the subject of Chapter 12.  The Window Object The Window object is the main entry point to all client-side JavaScript features and APIs. It represents a web browser win- dow or frame, and you can refer to it with the identifier win dow.  The  Window  object  defines  properties  like  location, which refers to a Location object that specifies the URL cur- rently displayed in the window and allows a script to load a new URL into the window:  The Window Object   165      Set location to navigate to a new web page window.location = "http:  www.oreilly.com ";  The Window object also defines methods like alert  , which displays a message in a dialog box, and setTimeout  , which registers a function to be invoked after a specified amount of time:     Wait 2 seconds and then say hello setTimeout function   { alert "hello" ; }, 2000 ;  Notice that the code above does not explicitly use the window property. In client-side JavaScript, the Window object is also the global object. This means that the Window object is at the top of the scope chain and that its properties and methods are effectively global variables and global functions. The Window object has a property named window that always refers to itself. You can use this property if you need to refer to the window object itself, but it is not usually necessary to use window if you just want to refer to access properties of the global window object.  As the global object, Window defines an assortment of prop- erties  and  methods  for  client-side  JavaScript  programming. The most important of these is the document property, which is the subject of Chapter 11. The other properties and methods are covered in the subsections below.  Timers setTimeout   and setInterval   allow you to register a func- tion to be invoked once or repeatedly after a specified amount of time has elapsed. These are important global functions of client-side JavaScript, and are therefore defined as methods of Window,  but  they  are  general-purpose  functions  and  don’t really have anything to do with the window.  The setTimeout   method of the Window object schedules a function to run after a specified number of milliseconds elap- ses. setTimeout   returns a value that can be passed to clear Timeout   to cancel the execution of the scheduled function.  166  Chapter 10: Client-Side JavaScript   If you call setTimeout   with a time of 0 ms, the function you specify  is  not  invoked  right  away.  Instead,  it  is  placed  on  a queue to be invoked “as soon as possible” after any currently pending event handlers finish running.  setInterval    is  like  setTimeout    except  that  the  specified function  is  invoked  repeatedly  at  intervals  of  the  specified number of milliseconds:     Call updateClock   every 60 seconds setInterval updateClock, 60000 ;  Like setTimeout  , setInterval   returns a value that can be passed to clearInterval   to cancel any future invocations of the scheduled function.  Browser Location and Navigation The location property of the Window object refers to a Loca- tion object, which represents the current URL of the document displayed in the window, and which also defines methods for making the window load a new document.  The location property of a window is a reference to a Location object; it represents the current URL of the document being displayed in that window. The href property of the Location object is a string that contains the complete text of the URL. The  toString    method  of  the  Location  object  returns  the value of the href property, so you can usually just write loca tion rather than location.href. Other  properties  of  this  object—protocol,  host,  hostname, port, pathname, search, and hash—specify the individual parts of the URL. They are known as “URL decomposition” prop- erties, and they are also supported by Link objects  created by   and   elements in HTML documents . The Location object also defines a reload  , which makes the browser reload the document.  The Window Object   167   The  Location  object  can  also  be  used  to  make  the  browser navigate to a new page: simply assign the new URL directly to the location property:  location = "http:  www.oreilly.com";  You can also assign relative URLs to  location. They are re- solved against the current URL:  location = "page2.html";    Next page  A bare fragment identifier is a special kind of relative URL that does not cause the browser to load a new document but simply scroll to display a new section of the document. The identifier  top is a special case: if no document element has the ID “top,” it makes the browser jump to the start of the document:  location = "top";  The URL decomposition properties of the Location object are writable, and setting them changes the location URL and also causes the browser to load a new document  or, in the case of the hash property, to navigate within the current document :  location.search = "?page=" +  pagenum+1 ;  Browsing History The history property of the Window object refers to the His- tory  object  for  the  window.  The  History  object  models  the browsing history of a window as a list of documents and docu- ment states.  The History object has back   and forward   methods that be- have  like  the  browser’s  Back  and  Forward  buttons  do:  they make  the  browser  go  backward  or  forward  one  step  in  its browsing history. A third method, go  , takes an integer argu- ment and can skip any number of pages forward  for positive arguments  or backward  for negative arguments  in the his- tory list:  history.go -2 ;    Like clicking Back twice  168  Chapter 10: Client-Side JavaScript   If  a  window  contains  child  windows   such  as     ele- ments—see  “Relationships  Between  Frames”  on  page  173 , the browsing histories of the child windows are chronologically interleaved with the history of the main window. This means that calling history.back    for example  on the main window may cause one of the child windows to navigate back to a pre- viously displayed document but leave the main window in its current state.  Modern web applications can dynamically alter their own con- tent without loading a new document. Applications that do this may want to allow the user to use the Back and Forward buttons to navigate between these dynamically created appli- cation states. One way to do this is to store application state by setting location.hash to a string that captures the applica- tion’s  current  state.  Even  though  this  does  not  load  a  new document, it creates a new history entry, and if the user later uses  the  Back  button  to  go  back  to  that  history  entry,  the browser  will  fire  a  “hashchange”  event.  An  application  that wants to track the Forward and Back buttons can register a handler by setting window.onhashchange. Another more complicated way of managing the browsing his- tory for a web application involves the  history.pushState   method and its corresponding window.onpopstate event han- dler. Coverage of that API is beyond the scope of this book, however.  Browser and Screen Information Scripts sometimes need to obtain information about the web browser in which they are running or the desktop on which the browser  appears.  This  section  describes  the  navigator  and screen properties of the Window object. Those properties refer to Navigator and Screen objects, respectively, and these objects provide information that allows a script to customize its be- havior based on its environment.  The navigator property of a Window object refers to a Navi- gator object that contains browser vendor and version number  The Window Object   169   information.  The  Navigator  object  is  named  after  the  early Navigator browser from Netscape, but it is also supported by all other browsers.  The Navigator object has four properties that provide infor- mation about the browser that is running:  appName  appVersion  The full name of the web browser. In IE, this is “Microsoft Internet  Explorer.”  In  Firefox,  this  property  is  “Net- scape.” For compatibility, other browsers often report the name “Netscape” as well.  This property typically begins with a number and follows that with a detailed string that contains browser vendor and version information. The number at the start of this string is often 4.0 or 5.0 to indicate generic compatibility with fourth- and fifth-generation browsers. There is no standard format for the appVersion string, so parsing it in a browser-independent way isn’t possible.  userAgent  platform  The string that the browser sends in its USER-AGENT HTTP header. This property typically contains all the informa- tion in appVersion and may contain additional details as well. Like appVersion, there is no standard format.  A string that identifies the operating system  and possibly the hardware  on which the browser is running.  In  addition  to  its  browser  vendor  and  version  information properties, the Navigator object has some miscellaneous prop- erties and methods. The standardized and widely implemented nonstandard properties include:  onLine  The  navigator.onLine  property   if  it  exists   specifies whether  the  browser  is  currently  connected  to  the network.  170  Chapter 10: Client-Side JavaScript   geolocation  A Geolocation object that defines an API for determining the user’s geographical location. The details of this API are beyond the scope of this pocket reference.  The screen property of a Window object refers to a Screen ob- ject that provides information about the size of the user’s dis- play. The width and height properties specify the size of the display in pixels. The availWidth and availHeight properties specify the display size that is actually available; they exclude the space required by features such as a desktop taskbar. You might use the Screen object to determine whether your web app is running in a small form factor device such as a tablet or mobile phone.  Dialog Boxes The  Window  object  provides  three  methods  for  displaying simple dialog boxes to the user. alert   displays a message to the  user  and  waits  for  the  user  to  dismiss  the  dialog.  con firm   displays a message, waits for the user to click an OK or Cancel button and returns a boolean value. And prompt   dis- plays a message, waits for the user to enter a string, and returns that string. The following code uses all three methods:  do {      Ask for a string   var n = prompt "What is your name?" ;      Ask for a confirmation   var ok = confirm "Is " + n + " okay?" ; } while !ok  alert "Hello, " + n ;    Display a greeting  Although the alert  , confirm  , and prompt   methods are very easy to use, good design dictates that you use them spar- ingly, if at all. Dialog boxes like these are not a common feature on the Web, and most users will find the dialog boxes produced by these methods disruptive to their browsing experience.  The Window Object   171   Document Elements as Window Properties If you name an element in your HTML document using the id attribute, and if the Window object does not already have a property by that name, the Window object is given a nonenu- merable property whose name is the value of the id attribute and whose value is the HTMLElement object that represents that document element.  As we’ve already noted, the Window object serves as the global object in client-side JavaScript, so this means that the id at- tributes  you  use  in  your  HTML  documents  become  global variables  if there are not already variables by those names  accessible to your scripts. If your document includes the ele- ment  , you can refer to that element using the global variable okay. The implicit use of element IDs as global variables is a historical quirk of web browser evolution. It is required for backward compatibility with existing web pages, but its use is not rec- ommended.  Instead,  explicitly  look  up  elements  using  the techniques shown in Chapter 11.  Multiple Windows and Frames A single web browser window on your desktop may contain several tabs. Each tab is an independent browsing context. Each has its own Window object, and each is isolated from all the others. The scripts running in one tab usually have no way of even knowing that the other tabs exist, much less of interacting with their Window objects or manipulating their document content. If you use a web browser that does not support tabs, or if you have tabs turned off, you may have many web browser windows open on your desktop at one time. As with tabs, each desktop window has its own Window object, and each is usu- ally independent of and isolated from all of the others.  HTML  documents  may  contain  nested  documents  using  an   element. An   creates a nested browsing con- text  represented  by  a  Window  object  of  its  own.  The  172  Chapter 10: Client-Side JavaScript   deprecated   and   elements also create nested browsing  contexts,  and  each     is  represented  by  a Window. Client-side JavaScript makes very little distinction between  windows,  tabs,  iframes,  and  frames:  they  are  all browsing contexts, and to JavaScript, they are all Window ob- jects. Nested browsing contexts are not isolated from one an- other the way independent tabs usually are. A script running in one frame can always see its ancestor and descendant frames, though the same-origin policy described in “The Same-Origin Policy” on page 176 may prevent the script from inspecting the documents in those frames. Nested frames are the topic of “Relationships Between Frames” on page 173.  Since the Window is the global object of client-side JavaScript, each window or frame has a separate JavaScript execution con- text. Nevertheless, JavaScript code in one window can, subject to  same-origin  constraints,  use  the  objects,  properties,  and methods defined in other windows. This is discussed in more detail in “JavaScript in Interacting Windows” on page 175.  Relationships Between Frames You already know that the JavaScript code in any window or frame  can  refer  to  its  own  Window  object  as  window   or  as self . A frame can refer to the Window object of the window or frame that contains it using the parent property:  parent.history.back  ;  A Window object that represents a top-level window or tab has no container, and its parent property simply refers to the win- dow itself:  parent == self;    For toplevel windows  If a frame is contained within another frame that is contained within a top-level window, that frame can refer to the top-level window as parent.parent. The top property is a general-case shortcut, however: no matter how deeply a frame is nested, its top  property  refers  to  the  top-level  containing  window.  If  a Window  object  represents  a  top-level  window,  top  simply refers to that window itself. For frames that are direct children  The Window Object   173   of  a  top-level  window,  the  top  property  is  the  same  as  the parent property. The  parent  and  top  properties  allow  a  script  to  refer  to  its frame’s ancestors. There is more than one way to refer to the descendant frames of a window or frame. Frames are created with   elements. You can obtain an Element object that represents an   just as you would do for any other ele- ment.  Suppose  your  document  contains   . Then, the Element object that represents this iframe is:  var e = document.getElementById "f1" ;    elements have a contentWindow property that refers to the Window object of the frame, so the Window object for this frame is:  var kid = document.getElementById "f1" .contentWindow;  You can go in the reverse direction—from the Window that represents a frame to the   Element that contains the frame—with the frameElement property of the Window. Win- dow  objects  that  represent  top-level  windows  rather  than frames have a null frameElement property: var elt = document.getElementById "f1" ; var w = elt.contentWindow; w.frameElement === elt     Always true for frames w.frameElement === null    For toplevel windows  It is not usually necessary to use the getElementById   method and  the  contentWindow  property  to  obtain  references  to  the child frames of a window, however. Every Window object has a  frames  property  that  refers  to  the  child  frames  contained within the window or frame. The frames property refers to an array-like object that can be indexed numerically or by frame name. To refer to the first child frame of a window, you can use frames[0]. To refer to the third child frame of the second child,  you  can  use  frames[1].frames[2].  Code  running  in  a frame might refer to a sibling frame as parent.frames[1]. Note that the elements of the frames[] array are Window objects, not   elements.  174  Chapter 10: Client-Side JavaScript   If you specify the name or id attribute of an   element, that frame can be indexed by name as well as by number. A frame  named  “f1”  would  be  frames["f1"]  or  frames.f1,  for example.  You can use the name or id attribute of an   element to give the frame a name that can be used in JavaScript code. If you use the name attribute, however, the name you specify also becomes the value of the name property of the Window that represents the frame. A name specified in this way can be used as the target attribute of a link.  JavaScript in Interacting Windows Each window or frame is its own JavaScript execution context with a Window as its global object. But if code in one window or frame can refer to another window or frame  and if the same- origin policy does not prevent it , the scripts in one window or frame can interact with the scripts in the other.  Imagine a web page with two   elements named “A” and “B,” and suppose that those frames contain documents from the same server and that those documents contain inter- acting scripts. The script in frame A might define a variable i:  That variable is nothing more than a property of the global object—a property of the Window object. Code in frame A can refer to the variable with the identifier i, or it can explicitly reference it through the window object:  var i = 3;  window.i  Since the script in frame B can refer to the Window object for frame  A,  it  can  also  refer  to  the  properties  of  that  window object:  parent.A.i = 4;  Recall that the function keyword that defines functions creates a variable just like the var keyword does. If a script in frame B declares a function f, that function is a global variable in frame B, and code in frame B can invoke f as f  . Code in frame A,  The Window Object   175   however, must refer to f as a property of the Window object of frame B:  parent.B.f  ;  If the code in frame A needs to use this function frequently, it might assign the function to a variable of frame A so that it can more conveniently refer to the function:  var f = parent.B.f;  Now code in frame A can invoke the function as f  , just as code in frame B does.  When  you  share  functions  between  frames  or  windows  like this, it is important to keep the rules of lexical scoping in mind. A function is executed in the scope in which it was defined, not in the scope from which it is invoked. Thus, if the function f above refers to global variables, these variables are looked up as properties of frame B, even when the function is invoked from frame A.  The Same-Origin Policy The  same-origin  policy  is  a  sweeping  security  restriction  on what web content JavaScript code can interact with. It typically comes into play when a web page includes   elements. In this case, the same-origin policy governs the interactions of JavaScript code in one window or frame with the content of other windows and frames. Specifically, a script can read only the properties of windows and documents that have the same origin as the document that contains the script.  The origin of a document is defined as the protocol, host, and port of the URL from which the document was loaded. Docu- ments loaded from different web servers have different origins. Documents loaded through different ports of the same host have different origins. And a document loaded with the http: protocol  has  a  different  origin  than  one  loaded  with  the https: protocol, even if they come from the same web server. It is important to understand that the origin of the script itself is not relevant to the same-origin policy: what matters is the  176  Chapter 10: Client-Side JavaScript   origin of the document in which the script is embedded. Sup- pose, for example, that a script hosted by host A is included  using the src property of a   element  in a web page served by host B. The origin of that script is host B and the script has full access to the content of the document that con- tains it. If the script creates an iframe and loads a second docu- ment from host B into it, the script also has full access to the content of that second document. But if the script opens an- other iframe and loads a document from host C  or even one from host A  into it, the same-origin policy comes into effect and prevents the script from accessing this document.  The same-origin policy does not actually apply to all properties of all objects in a window from a different origin. But it does apply to many of them, and, in particular, it applies to practi- cally all the properties of the Document object. You should consider any window or frame that contains a document from another server to be off-limits to your scripts.  The same-origin policy also applies to scripted HTTP requests made with the XMLHttpRequest object  see Chapter 13 . This object  allows  client-side  JavaScript  code  to  make  arbitrary HTTP requests to the web server from which the containing document was loaded, but it does not allow scripts to com- municate with other web servers.  The Window Object   177    CHAPTER 11 Scripting Documents  Client-side JavaScript exists to turn static HTML documents into interactive web applications. The Document object rep- resents  the  content  of  a  web  browser  window,  and  it  is  the subject of this chapter. The Document object does not stand alone, however. It is the central object in a larger API, known as the Document Object Model, or DOM, for representing and manipulating document content.  Overview of the DOM The Document Object Model, or DOM, is the fundamental API for representing and manipulating the content of HTML documents. The API is not particularly complicated, but there are a number of architectural details you need to understand. First, you should understand that the nested elements of an HTML or XML document are represented in the DOM as a tree of objects. The tree representation of an HTML document contains nodes representing HTML tags or elements, such as    and   ,  and  nodes  representing  strings  of  text.  An HTML document may also contain nodes representing HTML comments. Consider the following simple HTML document:             Sample Document   179                An HTML Document       This is a  simple  document.    The DOM representation of this document is the tree pictured in Figure 11-1.  Figure 11-1. The tree representation of an HTML document  If you are not already familiar with tree structures in computer programming, it is helpful to know that they borrow termi- nology from family trees. The node directly above a node is the  parent of that node. The nodes one level directly below another node are the children of that node. Nodes at the same level, and with the same parent, are siblings. The set of nodes any number of levels below another node are the descendants of that node. And the parent, grandparent, and all other nodes above a node are the ancestors of that node.  Each box in Figure 11-1 is a node of the document and is rep- resented by a Node object. We’ll talk about the properties and  180  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   methods of Node in some of the sections that follow. Note that the figure contains three different types of nodes. At the root of  the  tree  is  the  Document  node  that  represents  the  entire document. The nodes that represent HTML elements are Ele- ment nodes, and the nodes that represent text are Text nodes. Document, Element, and Text are subclasses of Node. Docu- ment and Element are the two most important DOM classes, and much of this chapter is devoted to their properties and methods.  Node and its subtypes form the type hierarchy illustrated in  Figure 11-2. Notice that there is a formal distinction between the generic Document and Element types, and the HTMLDo- cument and HTMLElement types. The Document type repre- sents either an HTML or an XML document, and the Element class  represents  an  element  of  such  a  document.  The HTMLDocument and HTMLElement subclasses are specific to HTML documents and elements. In this book, we often use the generic class names Document and Element, even when referring to HTML documents.  Figure 11-2. A partial class hierarchy of document nodes  Overview of the DOM  181   It is also worth noting in Figure 11-2 that there are many sub- types of HTMLElement that represent specific types of HTML elements.  Each  defines  JavaScript  properties  to  mirror  the HTML attributes of a specific element or group of elements. Some of these element-specific classes define additional prop- erties or methods that go beyond simple mirroring of HTML syntax.  Selecting Document Elements Most client-side JavaScript programs work by somehow ma- nipulating one or more document elements. When these pro- grams start, they can use the global variable  document  to refer to the Document object. In order to manipulate elements of the document, however, they must somehow obtain or select the Element objects that refer to those document elements. The DOM defines a number of ways to select elements; you can query a document for an element or elements:    with a specified id attribute;   with a specified name attribute;   with the specified tag name;   with the specified CSS class or classes; or   matching the specified CSS selector  The  subsections  that  follow  explain  each  of  these  element selection techniques.  Selecting Elements by ID Any HTML element can have an id attribute. The value of this attribute must be unique within the document—no two ele- ments in the same document can have the same ID. You can select an element based on this unique ID with the getElement ById   method of the Document object:  var sect1 = document.getElementById "section1" ;  182  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   This is the simplest and most commonly used way to select elements. If your script is going to manipulate a certain specific set of document elements, give those elements id attributes, and look up the Element objects using that ID. If you need to look  up  more  than  one  element  by  ID,  you  might  find  the getElements   function of Example 11-1 useful.  Example 11-1. Looking up multiple elements by ID   *  * This function expects any number of string arguments.  * It treats each argument as an element id and calls  * document.getElementById   for each. It returns an  * object that maps ids to matching Element objects.  *  function getElements  *ids...*   {     var elements = {};            Start with empty map     for var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++  {         var id = arguments[i];    Argument is an elt id         var elt = document.getElementById id ;         if  elt == null              throw new Error "No element with id: " + id ;         elements[id] = elt;       Map id to element     }     return elements;              Return id to elt map }  Selecting Elements by Name The  HTML  name  attribute  was  originally  intended  to  assign names to form elements, and the value of this attribute is used when form data is submitted to a server. Like the id attribute, name assigns a name to an element. Unlike  id, however, the value of a name attribute does not have to be unique: multiple elements may have the same name, and this is common in the case of radio buttons and checkboxes in forms. Also, unlike id, the name attribute is only valid on a handful of HTML ele- ments, including forms, form elements,  , and   elements.  To select HTML elements based on the value of their name at- tributes, you can use the getElementsByName   method of the Document object:  Selecting Document Elements   183   var btns = document.getElementsByName "color" ;  getElementsByName   returns a NodeList object that behaves like a read-only array of Element objects.  Setting the name attribute of a  ,  , or  , creates a property of the Document object whose name is the value of the attribute  assuming, of course, that the document does not already have a property with that name . If there is only a single element with a given name, the value of the automatically cre- ated document property is the element itself. If there is more than one element, then the value of the property is a NodeList object that acts as an array of elements. The document prop- erties created for named   elements are special: instead of  referring  to  the  Element  object,  they  refer  to  the  frame’s Window object.  What this means is that some elements can be selected by name simply by using the name as a Document property:     Get the object for   var form = document.shipping_address;  Selecting Elements by Type You can select all elements of a specified type  or tag name  using  the  getElementsByTagName    method  of  the  Document object. To obtain a read-only array-like object containing the Element objects for all   elements in a document, for ex- ample, you might write:  var spans = document.getElementsByTagName "span" ;  Like  getElementsByName  ,  getElementsByTagName    returns  a NodeList object. The elements of the returned NodeList are in document order, so you can select the first   element of a document like this:  var firstpara = document.getElementsByTagName "p" [0];  HTML tags are case-insensitive, and when getElementsByTag Name    is  used  on  an  HTML  document,  it  performs  a  case- insensitive tag name comparison. The spans variable above, for  184  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   example, will include any   elements that were written as  . You  can  obtain  a  NodeList  that  represents  all  elements in  a  document  by  passing  the  wildcard  argument  “*”  to getElementsByTagName  . The  Element  class  also  defines  a  getElementsByTagName   method. It works in the same way as the Document version, but it only selects elements that are descendants of the element on which it is invoked. So to find all   elements inside the first   element of a document, you could write:  var firstp= document.getElementsByTagName "p" [0]; var firstpSpans = firstp.getElementsByTagName "span" ;  For  historical  reasons,  the  HTMLDocument  class  defines  shortcut  properties  to  access  certain  kinds  of  nodes.  The  images, forms, and links properties, for example, refer to ob- jects that behave like read-only arrays of  ,  , and    elements  but only   tags that have an href attribute . These properties refer to HTMLCollection objects, which are much like NodeList objects, but they can additionally be in- dexed by element ID or name. Earlier, we saw how you could refer to a named   element with an expression like this:  document.shipping_address  With  the  document.forms  property,  you  can  also  refer  more specifically to the named  or ID’ed  form like this:  document.forms.shipping_address;  HTMLDocument also defines two properties that refer to spe- cial  single  elements  rather  than  element  collections.  docu ment.body is the   element of an HTML document, and document.head  is  the     element.  The  documentElement property of the Document class refers to the root element of the document. In HTML documents, this is always an   element.  Selecting Document Elements   185   NodeLists and HTMLCollections  getElementsByName    and  getElementsByTagName    return NodeList  objects,  and  properties  like  document.images  and document.forms are HTMLCollection objects.  These  objects  are  read-only  array-like  objects.  They  have length  properties  and  can  be  indexed   for  reading  but  not writing   like  true  arrays.  You  can  iterate  the  contents  of  a NodeList or HTMLCollection with a standard loop like this:     Loop through all images and hide them for var i = 0; i < document.images.length; i++      document.images[i].style.display = "none";  One of the most important and surprising features of NodeList and HTMLCollection is that they are not static snapshots of a historical document state but are generally live, and the list of elements they contain can vary as the document changes. Sup- pose  you  call  getElementsByTagName 'div'   on  a  document with no   elements. The return value is a NodeList with a length of 0. If you then insert a new   element into the document, that element automatically becomes a member of the NodeList, and the length property changes to 1.  Selecting Elements by CSS Class The class attribute of an HTML is a space-separated list of zero or more identifiers. It describes a way to define sets of related document elements: any elements that have the same identifier in their class attribute are part of the same set. class is a re- served  word  in  JavaScript,  so  client-side  JavaScript  uses  the className property to hold the value of the HTML class at- tribute. The class attribute is usually used in conjunction with a CSS stylesheet to apply the same presentation styles to all members  of  a  set.  In  addition,  however,  HTML5  defines  a method,  getElementsByClassName  ,  that  allows  us  to  select sets  of  document  elements  based  on  the  identifiers  in  their class attribute.  186  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   Like  getElementsByTagName  ,  getElementsByClassName    can be invoked on both HTML documents and HTML elements, and it returns a live NodeList containing all matching descend- ants of the document or element.  getElementsByClassName   takes a single string argument, but the string may specify mul- tiple space-separated identifiers. Only elements that include all of the specified identifiers in their class attribute are matched. The order of the identifiers does not matter. Here are some examples of getElementsByClassName  :     Find all elements with class "warning" var w = document.getElementsByClassName "warning" ;    Find descendants of the element "log" that have    classes "error" and "fatal" var log = document.getElementById "log" ; var fatal = log.getElementsByClassName "fatal error" ;  Selecting Elements with CSS Selectors CSS stylesheets have a very powerful syntax, known as selec- tors, for describing elements or sets of elements within a docu- ment. Full details of CSS selector syntax are beyond the scope of this book, but some examples will demonstrate the basics. Elements can be described by ID, tag name, or class:  nav             An element with id="nav" div              Any   element .warning         Any element with class "warning"  More generally, elements can be selected based on attribute values:  p[lang="fr"]     A paragraph in French:   *[name="x"]      Any element with name="x" attribute  These basic selectors can be combined:  span.fatal.error      with classes "fatal" & "error" span[lang="fr"].warning    Any warning in French  Selectors can also specify document structure:  log span    Any   descendant of the log log>span    Any   child of the log body>h1:first-child    The first   child of    Selecting Document Elements   187   Selectors can be combined to select multiple elements or mul- tiple sets of elements:  div, log    All   elements plus the log  As you can see, CSS selectors allow elements to be selected in all of the ways described above: by ID, by name, by tag name, and by class name. You can select elements that match a CSS selector  with  the  Document  method  querySelectorAll  .  It takes a single string argument containing a CSS selector and returns a NodeList that represents all elements in the docu- ment that match the selector. Unlike previously described el- ement selection methods, the NodeList returned by  querySe lectorAll   is not live: it holds the elements that match the selector at the time the method was invoked, but it does not update as the document changes. If no elements match, query SelectorAll   returns an empty NodeList. If the selector string is invalid, querySelectorAll   throws an exception. In addition to querySelectorAll  , the document object also defines querySelector  , which is like querySelectorAll  , but returns only the first  in document order  matching element or null if there is no matching element. These two methods are also defined on Elements. When in- voked on an element, the specified selector is matched against the entire document, and then the result set is filtered so that it only includes descendants of the specified element.  Document Structure and Traversal Once  you  have  selected  an  Element  from  a  Document,  you sometimes need to find structurally related portions  parent, siblings, children  of the document. The Document object, its Element objects, and the Text objects that represent runs of text in the document are all Node objects. Node defines the following important properties:  188  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   parentNode  childNodes  The Node that is the parent of this one, or null for nodes like the Document object that have no parent.  A read-only array-like object  a NodeList  that is a live representation of a Node’s child nodes.  firstChild, lastChild  The first and last child nodes of a node, or null if the node has no children.  nextSibling, previousSibling  The next and previous sibling node of a node. Two nodes with the same parent are siblings. Their order reflects the order in which they appear in the document. These prop- erties connect nodes in a doubly linked list.  nodeType  nodeValue  nodeName  The kind of node this is. Document nodes have the value 9. Element nodes have the value 1. Text nodes have the value 3. Comment nodes have the value 8.  The textual content of a Text or Comment node.  The tag name of an Element, converted to uppercase.  Using these Node properties, the second child node of the first child of the Document can be referred to with expressions like these:  document.childNodes[0].childNodes[1] document.firstChild.firstChild.nextSibling  Suppose the document in question is the following:     Test   Hello!     Then the second child of the first child is the   element. It has a nodeType of 1 and a nodeName of “BODY.” Note, however, that this API is extremely sensitive to variations in the document text. If the document is modified by inserting  Document Structure and Traversal   189   a single newline between the    and the    tag, for example, the Text node that represents that newline becomes the  first  child  of  the  first  child,  and  the  second  child  is  the   element instead of the   body. When we are primarily interested in the Elements of a docu- ment instead of the text within them  and the whitespace be- tween them , it is helpful to use an API that allows us to treat a document as a tree of Element objects, ignoring Text and Comment nodes that are also part of the document.  The first part of this API is the children property of Element objects.  Like  childNodes,  this  is  a  NodeList.  Unlike childNodes, however, the children list contains only Element objects.  The second part of an element-based document traversal API is Element properties that are analogs to the child and sibling properties of the Node object:  firstElementChild, lastElementChild  Like firstChild and lastChild, but for Element children only.  nextElementSibling, previousElementSibling  Like  nextSibling and  previousSibling, but for Element siblings only. childElementCount  The number of Element children. Returns the same value as children.length.  Attributes HTML elements consist of a tag name and a set of name value pairs known as attributes. The   element that defines a hy- perlink, for example, uses the value of its href attribute as the destination of the link. The attribute values of HTML elements are available as properties of the HTMLElement objects that represent  those  elements.  The  HTMLElement  type  defines properties for the universal HTTP attributes such as id, title,  190  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   lang,  and  dir,  and  event  handler  properties  like  onclick. Element-specific  subtypes  define  attributes  specific  to  those elements. To query the URL of an image, for example, you can use the src property of the HTMLElement that represents the   element:  var img = document.getElementById "myimage" ;  var url = img.src;    The src attribute is the img URL  img.id = "myimg"      Change the id attribute value  Similarly, you might set the form-submission attributes of a    element with code like this:  var f = document.forms[0];    First   in doc f.method = "POST";    Post this form to url below f.action = "http:  www.example.com submit.php";  HTML attributes are not case-sensitive, but JavaScript prop- erty names are. To convert an attribute name to the JavaScript property, write it in lowercase. If the attribute is more than one word long, however, put the first letter of each word after the first in uppercase: defaultChecked and tabIndex, for example. Some HTML attribute names are reserved words in JavaScript. For these, the general rule is to prefix the property name with “html.” The HTML for attribute  of the   element , for example, becomes the JavaScript htmlFor property. “class” is a reserved  but unused  word in JavaScript, and the very im- portant  HTML  class  attribute  is  an  exception  to  the  rule above: it becomes className in JavaScript code. The properties that represent HTML attributes usually have a string value. When the attribute is a boolean or numeric value  the defaultChecked and maxLength attributes of an   el- ement,  for  example ,  the  properties  values  are  booleans  or numbers  instead  of  strings.  Event  handler  attributes  always have Function objects  or null  as their values. The HTML5 specification defines a few attributes  such as the form attribute of   and related elements  that convert element IDs to actual Element objects.  As  described  above,  HTMLElement  and  its  subtypes  define properties that correspond to the standard attributes of HTML  Attributes   191   elements. The Element type also defines  getAttribute    and  setAttribute    methods  that  you  can  use  to  query  and  set nonstandard HTML attributes:  var image = document.images[0]; var width = parseInt image.getAttribute "WIDTH"  ;  image.setAttribute "class", "thumbnail" ;  The code above highlights two important differences between these methods and the property-based API described above. First,  attribute  values  are  all  treated  as  strings.  getAttri bute    never  returns  a  number,  boolean,  or  object.  Second, these methods use standard attribute names, even when those names are reserved words in JavaScript. For HTML elements, the attribute names are case-insensitive.  Element also defines two related methods, hasAttribute   and  removeAttribute  , which check for the presence of a named attribute and remove an attribute entirely. These methods are particularly useful with boolean attributes: these are attributes  such as the disabled attribute of HTML form elements  whose presence or absence from an element matters but whose value is not relevant.  Element Content Take a look again at Figure 11-1, and ask yourself what the “content” of the   element is. There are three ways we might answer this question:    The content is the HTML string “This is a  simple     The  content  is  the  plain-text  string  “This  is  a  simple  document.”  document.”    The content is a Text node, an Element node that has a  Text node child, and another Text node.  Each of these are valid answers, and each answer is useful in its own way. The sections that follow explain how to work with  192  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   the HTML representation, the plain-text representation, and the tree representation of element content.  Element Content as HTML Reading the innerHTML property of an Element returns the con- tent of that element as a string of markup. Setting this property on an element invokes the web browser’s parser and replaces the element’s current content with a parsed representation of the new string.  Web  browsers  are  very  good  at  parsing  HTML  and  setting innerHTML is usually fairly efficient, even though the value you specify  must  be  parsed.  Note,  however,  that  repeatedly  ap- pending  bits  of  text  to  the  innerHTML  property  with  the  += operator is usually not efficient because it requires both a se- rialization step and a parsing step.  The insertAdjacentHTML   method allows you to insert a string of  arbitrary  HTML  markup  “adjacent”  to  the  specified  ele- ment. The markup is passed as the second argument to this method, and the precise meaning of “adjacent” depends on the value of the first argument. This first argument should be a string with one of the values “beforebegin,” “afterbegin,” “be- foreend,” or “afterend.” These values correspond to insertion points that are illustrated in Figure 11-3.  Figure 11-3. Insertion points for insertAdjacentHTML    Element Content as Plain Text Sometimes  you  want  to  query  the  content  of  an  element  as plain  text,  or  to  insert  plain-text  into  a  document   without having to escape the angle brackets and ampersands used in  Element Content   193   HTML markup . The standard way to do this is with the text Content property of Node:     Get first   in the document var para = document.getElementsByTagName "p" [0];      Get its text: "This is a simple document." var text = para.textContent;      Alter paragraph content para.textContent = "Hello World!";  Element Content as Text Nodes Another way to work with the content of an element is as a list of child nodes, each of which may have its own set of children. When thinking about element content, it is usually the Text nodes that are of interest.  Example 11-2 shows a textContent   function that recursively traverses the children of an element and concatenates the text of all the Text node descendants. In order to understand the code, recall that the nodeValue property  defined by the Node type  holds the content of a Text node.  Example 11-2. Finding all Text node descendants of an element     Return the plain-text content of element e,    recursing into child elements. This function works    like the textContent property function textContent e  {     var c, type, s = "";      for c=e.firstChild; c!=null; c=c.nextSibling  {         type = c.nodeType;         if  type === 3              Text node:             s += c.nodeValue;       add text content         else if  type === 1         Element node:             s += textContent c ;    recurse     }     return s; }  Note that the nodeValue property is read write and you can set it to change the content displayed by a Text node.  194  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   Creating, Inserting, and Deleting Nodes We’ve seen how to query and alter document content using strings of HTML and plain text. And we’ve also seen that we can traverse a Document to examine the individual Element and Text nodes that it is made of. It is also possible to alter a document at the level of individual nodes. The Document type defines methods for creating Element and Text objects, and the Node type defines methods for inserting, deleting, and replac- ing  nodes  in  the  tree.  The  following  function  demonstrates how to create and insert an element into the document:     Asynchronously load and execute a script  function loadasync url  {         Create a   element     var s = document.createElement "script" ;          Set its src attribute     s.src = url;        Insert the   into the       document.head.appendChild s ; }  As shown above, you can create new Element nodes with the createElement   method of the Document object. Pass the tag name of the element as the method argument.  Text nodes are created with a similar method:  var t = document.createTextNode "text node" ;  Another way to create new document nodes is to make copies of existing ones. Every node has a  cloneNode   method that returns a new copy of the node. Pass true to recursively copy all descendants as well, or false to only make a shallow copy. Once you have a new node, you can insert it into the document with  the  Node  methods  appendChild    or  insertBefore  . appendChild   is invoked on the Element node that you want to insert into, and it inserts the specified node so that it be- comes the lastChild of that node. insertBefore    is  like  appendChild  ,  but  it  takes  two  argu- ments.  The  first  argument  is  the  node  to  be  inserted.  The  Creating, Inserting, and Deleting Nodes   195   second argument is the node before which that node is to be inserted. This method is invoked on the node that will be the parent of the new node, and the second argument must be a child  of  that  parent  node.  If  you  pass  null  as  that  second argument, the insertBefore   behaves like appendChild   and inserts at the end.  Here is a simple function for inserting a node at a numerical index.  The  function  demonstrates  both  appendChild    and insertBefore  :     Insert the child node into parent at index n function insertAt parent, child, n  {     if  n   parent.childNodes.length          throw new Error "invalid index" ;     else if  n == parent.childNodes.length          parent.appendChild child ;     else         parent.insertBefore child,parent.childNodes[n] ; }  If you call appendChild   or insertBefore   to insert a node that is already in the document, that node will automatically be removed from its current position and reinserted at its new position: there is no need to explicitly remove the node.  The removeChild   method removes a node from the document tree.  Be  careful,  however:  this  method  isn’t  invoked  on  the node to be removed but  as the “child” part of its name implies  on the parent of that node. Invoke the method on the parent node  and  pass  the  child  node  that  is  to  be  removed  as  the method argument. To remove the node n from the document, you’d write:  n.parentNode.removeChild n ;  replaceChild   removes one child node and replaces it with a new one. Invoke this method on the parent node, passing the new node as the first argument and the node to be replaced as the second argument. To replace the node n with a string of text, for example, you could write:  var t = document.createTextNode "[ REDACTED ]" ; n.parentNode.replaceChild t, n ;  196  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   The following function demonstrates another use of replace Child  :     Replace the node n with a new   element and    make n a child of that element. function embolden n  {        If n is a string treat it as an element id     if  typeof n == "string"          n = document.getElementById n ;        Create a   element     var b = document.createElement "b" ;         Replace n with the   element     n.parentNode.replaceChild b, n ;                   Make n a child of the   element     b.appendChild n ;                     }  Element Style Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  is a standard for specifying the visual presentation of HTML documents. CSS is intended for use by graphic designers: it allows a designer to precisely spec- ify fonts, colors, margins, indentation, borders, and even the position of document elements. But CSS is also of interest to client-side JavaScript programmers because CSS styles can be scripted. This section explains how to script CSS and assumes that you are already somewhat familiar with CSS.  The  most  straightforward  way  to  script  CSS  is  to  alter  the style  attribute  of  individual  document  elements.  Like  most HTML attributes, style is a property of the Element object, and you can manipulate it in JavaScript. The style property is unusual, however: its value is not a string or other primitive value but a CSSStyleDeclaration object. The JavaScript prop- erties of this style object represent the CSS properties specified by the HTML style attribute. To make the text of an element e big, bold, and blue, for example, you can use the following code  to  set  the  JavaScript  properties  that  correspond  to  the font-size, font-weight, and color style properties:  Element Style  197   e.style.fontSize = "24pt"; e.style.fontWeight = "bold"; e.style.color = "blue";  Many CSS style properties, such as font-size, contain hyphens in their names. In JavaScript, a hyphen is interpreted as a minus sign, so it is not possible to write an expression like:  e.style.font-size = "24pt";    Syntax error!  Therefore, the names of the properties of the CSSStyleDecla- ration object are slightly different from the names of actual CSS properties. If a CSS property name contains one or more hy- phens, the CSSStyleDeclaration property name is formed by removing the hyphens and capitalizing the letter immediately following each hyphen. Thus, the CSS property border-left- width is accessed through the JavaScript borderLeftWidth prop- erty. Also, when a CSS property, such as the float property, has a name that is a reserved word in JavaScript, that name is prefixed with “css” to create a legal property name.  When working with the style properties of the CSSStyleDecla- ration object, remember that all values must be specified as strings. Also, remember that all the positioning properties re- quire units. Thus, it is not correct to set the left property like this:     Incorrect: this is a number, not a string e.style.left = 300;        Incorrect: the units are missing e.style.left = "300";  Units are required when setting style properties in JavaScript, just as they are when setting style properties in stylesheets. The correct way to set the value of the left property of an element e to 300 pixels is:  e.style.left = "300px";  If you want to set the left property to a computed value, be sure to append the units at the end of the computation:  e.style.left =  x0 + margin + border + padding  + "px";  198  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   Notice that the numeric result of the computation will be con- verted to a string as a side effect of appending the units string.  The style attribute of an HTML element is its inline style, and it overrides any style specifications in a stylesheet. Inline styles are generally useful for setting style values, and that is what the examples above have all done. You can read the properties of a CSSStyleDeclaration object that represents inline styles, but they return meaningful values only if they’ve previously been set by your JavaScript code or if the HTML element with which you are working has an inline style attribute that sets the de- sired properties. For example, your document may include a stylesheet that sets the left margin for all paragraphs to 30 pix- els,  but  if  you  read  the  marginLeft  property  of  one  of  your paragraph  elements,  you’ll  get  the  empty  string  unless  that paragraph has a style attribute that overrides the stylesheet setting.  Sometimes, you may find it easier to set or query the inline style of  an  element  as  a  single  string  value  rather  than  as  a CSSStyleDeclaration object. To do that, you can use the Ele- ment getAttribute   and setAttribute   methods, or you can use the cssText property of the CSSStyleDeclaration object:     Set the style attribute of e to the string s e.setAttribute "style", s ;   e.style.cssText = s;     Another way to do it     Query the inline style of the element e s = e.getAttribute "style" ; s = e.style.cssText;     Another way to do it  An alternative to scripting individual CSS styles through the inline  style  property  is  to  script  the  value  of  the  HTML class attribute. Changing an element’s class changes the set of stylesheet selectors that apply to the element and can cause multiple CSS properties to change at the same time. Suppose, for example, that you want a way to draw the user’s attention to individual paragraphs  or other elements  of a document. You might start by defining attention-grabbing styles for any elements that have a class name of “attention”:  Element Style  199   .attention {   * Styles to grab the user's attention *      background-color: yellow;     * Yellow highlight *      font-weight: bold;            * Bold text *      border: solid black 2px;      * Black box *  }  The identifier  class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so the HTML  class  attribute  is  available  to  JavaScript  code  using the  name  className.  Here  is  code  that  sets  and  clears  the className property of an element to add and remove the “at- tention” class for that element: function grabAttention e  {     e.className = "attention"; } function releaseAttention e  {     e.className = ""; }  HTML elements can be members of more than one CSS class and  the  class  attribute  holds  a  space-separated  list  of  class names. The className property has a misleading name: class Names would have been a much better choice. The functions above assume that the className property will specify zero or one class name and do not work when more than one class is in use. If an element already has a class assigned, calling the grabAttention   function for that element will overwrite the existing class.  HTML5 addresses this issue by defining a classList property for every element. The value of this property is known as a DOMTokenList:  a  read-only  array-like  object   “Array-Like Objects” on page 107  whose elements contain the individual class names for the element. More important than its array el- ements, however, are the methods defined by DOMTokenList.  add    and  remove    add  and  remove  individual  class  names from the element’s class attribute. toggle   adds a classname if it is not already present and removes it otherwise. Finally, the contains   method tests whether the class attribute con- tains a specified classname.  Like other DOM collection types, a DOMTokenList is a “live” representation  of  the  element’s  set  of  classes,  not  a  static  200  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   snapshot of the classes at the time the classList property is queried. If you obtain a DOMTokenList from the classList property of an element and then change the className property of that element, those changes are immediately visible through the token list. Similarly, any changes you make through the token  list  are  immediately  visible  through  the  className property.  Geometry and Scrolling In  this  chapter  so  far  we  have  thought  about  documents  as abstract trees of elements and text nodes. But when a browser renders a document within a window, it creates a visual rep- resentation of the document in which each element has a po- sition and a size. Often, web applications can treat documents as trees of elements and never have to think about how those elements  are  rendered  onscreen.  Sometimes,  however,  it  is necessary to determine the precise geometry of an element. CSS can be used, for example, to specify the position of an element. If  you  want  to  use  CSS  to  dynamically  position  an  element  such as a tooltip or callout  next to some ordinary browser- positioned element, you need to be able to determine the lo- cation of that element.  The position of an element is measured in pixels, with the x coordinate increasing to the right and the y coordinate increas- ing as we go down. There are two different points we can use as the coordinate system origin, however: the x and y coordi- nates of an element can be relative to the top-left corner of the document or relative to the top-left corner of the viewport in which the document is displayed. In top-level windows and tabs, the “viewport” is the portion of the browser that actually displays  document  content:  it  excludes  browser  “chrome” such as menus, toolbars, and tabs. For documents displayed in frames, the viewport is the   element that defines the frame. In either case, when we talk about the position of an element,  we  must  be  clear  whether  we  are  using  document  Geometry and Scrolling  201   coordinates or viewport coordinates.  Note that viewport co- ordinates are sometimes called window coordinates.   If the document is smaller than the viewport, or if it has not been scrolled, the upper-left corner of the document is in the upper-left corner of the viewport and the document and view- port coordinate systems are the same. In general, however, to convert between the two coordinate systems, we must add or subtract the scroll offsets. If an element has a y coordinate of 200 pixels in document coordinates, for example, and if the user has scrolled the browser down by 75 pixels, then that el- ement has a y coordinate of 125 pixels in viewport coordinates. Similarly, if an element has an x coordinate of 400 in viewport coordinates and the user has scrolled the viewport 200 pixels horizontally, the element’s x coordinate in document coordi- nates is 600.  Document coordinates are more fundamental than viewport coordinates,  and  they  do  not  change  when  the  user  scrolls. Nevertheless, it is quite common to use viewport coordinates in  client-side  programming.  We  use  document  coordinates when we specify an element position using CSS. But when we query the position of an element we get viewport coordinates. Similarly,  when  we  register  handler  functions  for  mouse events, the coordinates of the mouse pointer are reported in viewport coordinates.  In order to convert between coordinate systems, we need to be able to determine the scrollbar positions for the browser win- dow. The pageXOffset and pageYOffset properties of the Win- dow object provide these values.  It  is  sometimes  useful  to  be  able  to  determine  the  viewport size—to find what portions of the document are currently visi- ble, for example. Use the innerWidth and innerHeight proper- ties of the Window object to query the viewport size.  To determine the size and position of an element, call its get BoundingClientRect    method.  It  expects  no  arguments  and returns an object with properties left, right, top, and bottom. The left and top properties give the x and y coordinates of the  202  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   upper-left  corner  of  the  element  and  the  right  and  bottom properties give the coordinates of the lower-right corner.  This  method  returns  element  positions  in  viewport  coordi- nates. To convert to document coordinates that remain valid even  if  the  user  scrolls  the  browser  window,  add  the  scroll offsets:     Get position in viewport coordinates var box = e.getBoundingClientRect  ;      Convert to document coordinates var x = box.left + window.pageXOffset; var y = box.top + window.pageYOffset;  When an element is displayed in a browser, the element con- tent is surrounded by an optional blank area known as pad- ding. The padding is surrounded by an optional border, and the border is surrounded by optional margins. The coordinates returned by getBoundingClientRect   include the border and the  padding  of  the  element  but  do  not  include  the  element margins.  We saw above that you can query the position of a window’s scrollbars with pageXOffset and pageYOffset. If you want to set the scrollbar position, use the window’s scrollTo   method. This method takes the x and y coordinates of a point  in docu- ment coordinates  and sets these as the scrollbar offsets. That is, it scrolls the window so that the specified point is in the upper left corner of the viewport. If you specify a point that is too close to the bottom or too close to the right edge of the document, the browser will move it as close as possible to the upper left corner but won’t be able to get it all the way there.  The  scrollBy    method  of  the  Window  is  similar  to scrollTo  , but its arguments are relative and are added to the current scrollbar offsets.  Often, instead of scrolling to a numeric location in the docu- ment, we just want to scroll so that a certain element in the document is visible. You could compute the position of the element with getBoundingClientRect  , convert that position to document coordinates, and then use the scrollTo   method,  Geometry and Scrolling  203   but it is easier to just call the scrollIntoView   method on the desired HTML element. This method ensures that the element on which it is invoked is visible in the viewport. By default, it tries to put the top edge of the element at or near the top of the viewport. If you pass false as the only argument, it will try to put the bottom edge of the element at the bottom of the view- port. The browser will also scroll the viewport horizontally as needed to make the element visible.  204  Chapter 11: Scripting Documents   CHAPTER 12 Handling Events  Client-side JavaScript programs use an asynchronous event- driven programming model. In this style of programming, the web browser generates an event whenever something interest- ing happens to the document or browser or to some element or  object  associated  with  it.  For  example,  the  web  browser generates an event when it finishes loading a document, when the user moves the mouse over a hyperlink, or when the user strikes a key on the keyboard. If a JavaScript application cares about a particular type of event, it can register one or more functions to be invoked when events of that type occur.  The event type is a string that specifies what kind of event oc- curred. The type “mousemove,” for example, means that the user moved the mouse. The type “keydown” means that a key on the keyboard was pushed down. And the type “load” means that a document  or some other resource  has finished loading from the network. Because the type of an event is just a string, it is sometimes called an event name, and indeed, we use this name to identify the specific kind of event we’re talking about.  The event target is the object on which the event occurred or with which the event is associated. When we speak of an event, we must specify both the type and the target. A load event on a Window, for example, or a click event on a   Element. Window, Document, and Element objects are the most com- mon  event  targets  in  client-side  JavaScript  applications,  but  205   some events are triggered on other kinds of objects. In Chap- ter 13 we’ll see a readystatechange event that is triggered on an XMLHttpRequest object, for example.  An event handler or event listener is a function that handles or responds to an event. Applications register their event handler functions with the web browser, specifying an event type and an event target. When an event of the specified type occurs on the specified target, the browser invokes the handler. When event handlers are invoked for an object, we sometimes say that the browser has “fired,” “triggered,” or “dispatched” the event.  An event object is an object that is associated with a particular event and contains details about that event. Event objects are passed as an argument to the event handler function. All event objects have a type property that specifies the event type and a target property that specifies the event target. Each event type defines a set of properties for its associated event object. The object associated with a mouse event includes the coordi- nates of the mouse pointer, for example, and the object asso- ciated with a keyboard event contains details about the key that was pressed and the modifier keys that were held down. Many event  types  define  only  a  few  standard  properties—such  as type and target—and do not carry much other useful infor- mation.  For  those  events  it  is  the  simple  occurrence  of  the event, not the event details, that matter.  Event propagation is the process by which the browser decides which objects to trigger event handlers on. For events that are specific to a single object  such as the load event on the Win- dow object , no propagation is required. When certain kinds of events occur on document elements, however, they propa- gate or “bubble” up the document tree. If the user moves the mouse over a hyperlink, the mousemove event is first fired on the   element that defines that link. Then it is fired on the containing elements: perhaps a   element, a   element, and the Document object itself. It is sometimes more conve- nient to register a single event handler on a Document or other container element than to register handlers on each individual element you’re interested in. An event handler can stop the  206  Chapter 12: Handling Events   propagation of an event, so that it will not continue to bubble and will not trigger handlers on containing elements.  In another form of event propagation, known as event captur- ing, handlers specially registered on container elements have the opportunity to intercept  or “capture”  events before they are delivered to their actual target.  Some events have default actions associated with them. When a click event occurs on a hyperlink, for example, the default action is for the browser to follow the link and load a new page. Event handlers can prevent this default action by invoking a method of the event object.  With those terms defined, we can now move on to study events and event handling in detail. The first section that follows is an overview of the many event types supported by web browsers. The next two sections explain how to register event handlers and how the browser invokes those event handlers.  Types of Events The sections below cover various categories of events: form events, mouse events, key events, and so on. Each section de- scribes the event types in a category, and also explains the im- portant properties of the event objects that are associated with events of those types.  Form Events Forms and hyperlinks were the first scriptable elements in a web page, way back in the early days of the Web and of Java- Script. This means that form events are some of the most stable and well-supported of all event types.   elements fire sub- mit events when the form is submitted and reset events when the form is reset. Button-like form elements  including radio buttons and checkboxes  fire click events when the user inter- acts  with  them.  Form  elements  that  maintain  some  kind  of state generally fire change events when the user changes their  Types of Events   207   state by entering text, selecting an item, or checking a box. For text input fields, a change event is not fired until the user has finished  interacting  with  a  form  element  and  has  tabbed  or clicked to move focus to another element. Form elements re- spond  to  keyboard  focus  changes  by  firing  focus  and  blur events when they gain and lose the focus.  The submit and reset events have default actions that can be canceled by event handlers, and some click events do, too. The focus and blur events do not bubble, but all the other form events do.  Window Events Window events represent occurrences related to the browser window itself, rather than any specific document content dis- played inside the window.  For some of these events, however, an  event  with  the  same  name  can  be  fired  on  document elements.   The load event is the most important of these events: it is fired when  a  document  and  all  of  its  external  resources   such as  images   are  fully  loaded  and  displayed  to  the  user. DOMContentLoaded and readystatechange are alternatives to the load event: they are triggered sooner, when the document and its elements are ready to manipulate, but before external resources are fully loaded.  The unload event is the opposite of load: it is triggered when the user is navigating away from a document. An unload event handler might be used to save the user’s state, but it cannot be used to cancel navigation. The beforeunload event is similar to unload but gives you the opportunity to ask the user to confirm that they really want to navigate away from your web page. If a handler for beforeunload returns a string, that string will be displayed to the user in a confirmation dialog before the new page is loaded, and the user will have the opportunity to cancel her navigation and remain at your page.  208  Chapter 12: Handling Events   The focus and blur events described above for form elements are also used as Window events: they are triggered on a window when that browser window receives or loses keyboard focus from the operating system.  Finally, the resize and scroll events are fired on a Window when the user resizes or scrolls the browser window. Scroll events can also be fired on any scrollable document element, such as those with the CSS overflow property set.  Mouse Events Mouse events are generated when the user moves or clicks the mouse over a document. These events are triggered on the most deeply nested element that the mouse pointer is over, but they bubble up through the document. The event object passed to mouse event handlers has properties set that describe the po- sition and button state of the mouse and also specify whether any modifier keys were held down when the event occurred. The clientX and clientY properties specify the position of the mouse in window coordinates. The altKey, ctrlKey, metaKey, and shiftKey properties are set to true when the corresponding keyboard modifier keys are held down. And for click events, the detail property specifies whether this was a single, double, or triple click.  The mousemove event is triggered any time the user moves or drags  the  mouse.  These  events  occur  frequently,  so  mouse- move  handlers  must  not  trigger  computationally  intensive tasks.  The  mousedown  and  mouseup  events  are  triggered when the user presses and releases a mouse button. By regis- tering a mousedown handler that registers a mousemove han- dler, you can detect and respond to mouse drags. Doing this properly involves being able to capture mouse events so that you  continue  to  receive  mousemove  events  even  when  the mouse has moved out of the element it started in.  After a mousedown and mouseup event sequence, the browser also triggers a click event. If the user clicks a mouse button twice in a row  within a sufficiently short amount of time , the  Types of Events   209   second click event will be followed by a dblclick event. Brows- ers often display a context menu when the right mouse button is clicked. They generally fire a contextmenu event before dis- playing the menu, and if you cancel the event, you can prevent the display of the menu. This is also an easy way to be notified of right mouse button clicks.  When the user moves the mouse so that it goes over a new element, the browser fires a mouseover event on that element. When the mouse moves so that it is no longer over an element, the browser fires a mouseout event on that element. For these events, the event object will have a relatedTarget property that specifies the other element involved in the transition. mouse- over and mouseout events bubble like all of the mouse events described  here.  This  is  often  inconvenient,  because  when  a mouseout handler is triggered, you have to check whether the mouse actually left the element you are interested in or if it merely transitioned from one child of the element to another. mouseenter and mouseleave are new, nonbubbling versions of mouseover  and  mouseout  that  are  supported  in  new browsers.  When  the  user  rotates  the  mouse  wheel,  browsers  trigger  a mousewheel event. The event object passed with these events includes properties that specify how much, and in which di- rection, the wheel was rotated.  Key Events When the web browser has keyboard focus, it generates events each time the user presses or releases a key on the keyboard. Keyboard shortcuts that have meaning to the operating system or to the browser itself are often “eaten” by the OS or browser and may not be visible to JavaScript event handlers, however. Keyboard events are triggered on whatever document element has keyboard focus, and they bubble up to the document and window. If no element has the focus, the events are triggered directly on the document. Keyboard event handlers are passed an event object with a keyCode field that specifies what key was  210  Chapter 12: Handling Events   pressed or released. In addition to keyCode, the event object for key events also has altKey, ctrlKey, metaKey, and shiftKey that describe the state of the keyboard modifier keys.  The keydown and keyup events are low-level keyboard events: they  are  triggered  whenever  a  key   even  a  modifier  key   is pressed or released. When a keydown event generates a print- able character, an additional keypress event is triggered after the keydown but before the keyup.  In the case of a key that is held down until it repeats, there may be many keypress events before the keyup event.  The keypress event is a higher-level text event, and its event object specifies the character that was generated, not the key that was pressed. In some browsers  no- tably Firefox  you must use the charCode property of a keypress event object instead of keyCode. The keydown, keyup, and keypress events are supported by all browsers,  but  there  are  some  interoperability  problems  be- cause  the  values  of  the  keyCode  property  are  not  well standardized.  HTML5 Events HTML5 and related standards define a host of new APIs for web applications. Many of these APIs define events. This sec- tion lists and briefly describes these HTML5 and web applica- tion events. Some of these events are ready to be used now; others are not yet widely implemented.  One of the widely advertised features of HTML5 is inclusion of   and   elements for playing sound and video. These elements have a long list of events that they trigger to send notifications about network events, data buffering status, and playback state:  canplay         loadeddata      playing     stalled canplaythrough  loadedmetadata  progress    suspend durationchange  loadstart       ratechange  timeupdate emptied         pause           seeked      volumechange ended           play            seeking     waiting  Types of Events   211   These media events are passed an ordinary event object with no  special  properties.  The  target  property  identifies  the    or     element,  however,  and  that  element  has many relevant properties and methods.  The HTML5 drag-and-drop API allows JavaScript applications to participate in OS-based drag-and-drop operations, transfer- ring data between web applications and native applications. The API defines the following seven event types:  dragstart    drag        dragend dragenter    dragover    dragleave drop  These drag-and-drop events are triggered with an event object like those sent with mouse events. One additional property, dataTransfer, holds a DataTransfer object that contains infor- mation  about  the  data  being  transferred  and  the  formats  in which it is available.  HTML5 defines a history management mechanism that allows web applications to interact with the browser’s Back and For- ward buttons. This mechanism involves events named hash- change and popstate. These events are life cycle notification events like load and unload and are fired at the Window object rather than any individual document element.  HTML5 defines a lot of new features for HTML forms. In ad- dition to standardizing the form input event described earlier, HTML5 also defines a form validation mechanism, which in- cludes an invalid event fired on form elements that have failed validation.  HTML5 includes support for offline web applications that can be installed locally in an application cache so that they can run even when the browser is offline  as when a mobile device is out of network range . The two most important events associ- ated with this are the offline and online events: they are trig- gered on the Window object whenever the browser loses or gains a network connection. A number of additional events are defined to provide notification of application download pro- gress and application cache updates:  212  Chapter 12: Handling Events   cached      checking      downloading    error noupdate    obsolete      progress       updateready  A number of new web application APIs use a message event for asynchronous communication. The Cross-Document Messag- ing API allows scripts in a document from one server to ex- change  messages  with  scripts  in  a  document  from  another server. This works around the limitations of the same-origin policy  “The Same-Origin Policy” on page 176  in a secure way. Each message that is sent triggers a message event on the Win- dow of the receiving document. The event object passed to the handler includes a data property that holds the content of the message as well as source and origin policies that identify the sender of the message. The message event is used in similar ways for communication with Web Workers and for network communication via Server-Sent Events and WebSockets.  HTML5  and  related  standards  define  some  events  that  are triggered  on  objects  other  than  windows,  documents,  and document elements. Version 2 of the XMLHttpRequest spec- ification, as well as the File API specification, define a series of events that track the progress of asynchronous I O. They trig- ger events on an XMLHttpRequest or FileReader object. Each read operation begins with a loadstart event, followed by pro- gress events and a loadend event. Additionally, each operation ends  with  a  load,  error,  or  abort  event  just  before  the  final loadend event.  Finally, HTML5 and related standards define a few miscella- neous event types. The Web Storage API defines a storage event  on the Window object  that provides notification of changes to stored data. HTML5 also standardizes the beforeprint and afterprint events that were originally introduced by Microsoft in IE. As their names imply, these events are triggered on a Window immediately before and immediately after its docu- ment is printed and provide an opportunity to add or remove content  such  as  the  date  and  time  that  the  document  was printed.  These events should not be used to change the pre- sentation of a document for printing because CSS media types already exist for that purpose.   Types of Events   213   Touchscreen and Mobile Events The widespread adoption of mobile devices with touchscreens has required the creation of new categories of events. In many cases, touchscreen events are mapped to traditional event types such  as  click  and  scroll.  But  not  every  interaction  with  a touchscreen UI emulates a mouse, and not all touches can be treated as mouse events. This section briefly explains the ges- ture and touch events generated by Safari when running on  Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices and also covers the orienta- tionchange event generated when the user rotates the device.  Safari generates gesture events for two-finger scaling and rota- tion gestures. The gesturestart event is fired when the gesture begins and gestureend is fired when it ends. Between these two events are a sequence of gesturechange events that track the progress of the gesture. The event object sent with these events has numeric scale and  rotation  properties. The scale prop- erty is the ratio of the current distance between the two fingers to the initial distance between the fingers. A “pinch close” ges- ture has a scale less than 1.0, and a “pinch open” gesture has a scale greater than 1.0. The rotation property is the angle of finger  rotation  since  the  start  of  the  event.  It  is  reported  in degrees, with positive values indicating clockwise rotation.  Gesture events are high-level events that notify you of a gesture that has already been interpreted. If you want to implement your own custom gestures, you can listen for low-level touch events. When a finger touches the screen, a touchstart event is triggered. When the finger moves, a touchmove event is trig- gered. And when the finger is lifted from the screen, a touchend event is triggered. Unlike mouse events, touch events do not directly report the coordinates of the touch. Instead, the object sent with a touch event has a changedTouches property. This property is an array-like object whose elements each describe the position of a touch.  The orientationchanged event is triggered on the Window ob- ject by devices that allow the user to rotate the screen from portrait  to  landscape  mode.  The  object  passed  with  an  214  Chapter 12: Handling Events   orientationchanged event is not useful itself. In mobile Safari, however, the  orientation  property of the Window object gives the current orientation as one of the numbers 0, 90, 180, or –90.  Registering Event Handlers There are two ways to register event handlers. The first is to set a property on the object or document element that is the event target. The second technique is to pass the handler to a method of the object or element. To complicate matters, there are two versions of each technique. You can set an event handler prop- erty in JavaScript code, or for document elements, you can set the corresponding attribute directly in HTML.  Setting Event Handler Properties The simplest way to register an event handler is by setting a property of the event target to the desired event handler func- tion. By convention, event handler properties have names that consist of the word “on” followed by the event name: onclick, onchange,  onload,  onmouseover,  and  so  on.  Note  that  these property names are case-sensitive and are written in all lower- case, even when the event type  such as “readystatechange” consists of multiple words. Here are two example event han- dler registrations:     Set the onload property of the Window object.    The function is the event handler:    it is invoked when the document loads. window.onload = function   {          Look up a   element     var elt = document.getElementById "address" ;        Register an event handler function that will         be invoked right before the form is submitted.     elt.onsubmit = function   { return validate this ; } }  The shortcoming of event handler properties is that they are designed around the assumption that event targets will have at most  one  handler  for  each  type  of  event.  If  you  are  writing  Registering Event Handlers   215   library code for use in arbitrary documents you can’t rely on this technique.  Setting Event Handler Attributes The event handler properties of a document element can also be set as attributes on the corresponding HTML tag. If you do this, the attribute value should be a string of JavaScript code. That code should be the body of the event handler function, not a complete function declaration. That is, your HTML event handler code should not be surrounded by curly braces and prefixed with the function keyword. For example:      Click Here    If an HTML event handler attribute contains multiple Java- Script statements, you must remember to separate those state- ments with semicolons or to break the attribute value across multiple lines.  Some event types are directed at the browser as a whole, rather than at any particular document element. In JavaScript, han- dlers for these events are registered on the Window object. In HTML, we place them on the   tag, but the browser reg- isters them on the Window. The following is the complete list of  such  event  handlers  as  defined  by  the  draft  HTML5 specification:  onafterprint    onfocus        ononline       onresize         onbeforeprint   onhashchange   onpagehide     onstorage        onbeforeunload  onload         onpageshow     onundo onblur          onmessage      onpopstate     onunload onerror         onoffline      onredo  When you specify a string of JavaScript code as the value of an HTML  event  handler  attribute,  the  browser  converts  your string into a function that looks something like this:  function event  {     with document  {         with this.form  {}  {             with this  {  216  Chapter 12: Handling Events                    * your code here *              }         }     } }  We’ll see more about the event argument and the with state- ments  above  when  we  consider  event  handler  invocation  in “Event Handler Invocation” on page 218.  addEventListener   Any object that can be an event target—this includes the Win- dow  and  Document  objects  and  all  document  Elements— defines a method named addEventListener   that you can use to  register  an  event  handler  for  that  target.  addEventLis tener   takes three arguments. The first is the event type for which the handler is being registered. The event type  or name  is a string and it should not include the “on” prefix that is used when setting event handler properties. The second argument to addEventListener   is the function that should be invoked when the specified type of event occurs. The final argument to addEventListener    is  an  optional  boolean  value.  Normally, you’ll  pass  false  for  this  argument  or  omit  it.  If  you  pass true instead, your function is registered as a capturing event handler and is invoked at a different phase of event dispatch. We  will  cover  event  capturing  in  “Event  Propaga- tion” on page 221.  The code below registers two handlers for the click event on a    element. Note the differences between the two tech- niques used:   Click me    var b = document.getElementById "mybutton" ; b.onclick = function   { alert "Thanks!" ; }; b.addEventListener "click",         function   { alert "Thanks again!" ; } ;    Registering Event Handlers   217   Calling addEventListener   with “click” as its first argument does not affect the value of the onclick property. In the code above, a button click will generate two alert   dialog boxes. More importantly, you can call addEventListener   multiple times to register more than one handler function for the same event type on the same object. When an event occurs on an object, all of the handlers registered for that type of event are invoked, in the order in which they were registered. Invoking addEventListener   more than once on the same object with the same arguments has no effect—the handler function re- mains registered only once, and the repeated invocation does not alter the order in which handlers are invoked.  addEventListener    is  paired  with  a  removeEventListener   method that expects the same three arguments but removes an event handler function from an object rather than adding it. It is often useful to temporarily register an event handler and then remove it soon afterward. For example, when you get a mouse- down  event,  you  might  register  temporary  capturing  event handlers for mousemove and mouseup events so that you can see if the user drags the mouse. You’d then deregister these handlers when the mouseup event arrives. In such a situation, your event handler removal code might look like this:  document.removeEventListener "mousemove",                              handleMove, true ; document.removeEventListener "mouseup",                              handleUp, true ;  Event Handler Invocation Once you’ve registered an event handler, the web browser will invoke it automatically when an event of the specified type oc- curs on the specified object. This section describes event han- dler invocation in detail, explaining event handler arguments, the invocation context  the this value , the invocation scope, and the meaning of the return value of an event handler.  In addition to describing how individual handlers are invoked, this section also explains how events propagate: how a single  218  Chapter 12: Handling Events   event can trigger the invocation of multiple handlers on the original event target and also on containing elements of the document.  Event Handler Argument Event handlers are invoked with an event object as their single argument. The properties of the event object  described earlier in this chapter  provide details about the event.  Recall from “Setting Event Handler Attributes” on page 216 that when you register an event handler by setting an HTML attribute, the browser converts your string of JavaScript code into  a  function  with  a  single  argument  named  event.  This means that HTML event handlers can refer to the event object as event.  Event Handler Context When you register an event handler by setting a property, it looks as if you are defining a new method on an object:  e.onclick = function   {  * handler code *  };  It isn’t surprising, therefore, that event handlers are invoked as methods  of  the  object  on  which  they  are  defined.  That  is, within the body of an event handler, the this keyword refers to the event target.  Handlers registered using addEventListener   are also invoked with the target as their this value.  Event Handler Scope Like  all  JavaScript  functions,  event  handlers  are  lexically scoped. They are executed in the scope in which they are de- fined, not the scope from which they are invoked, and they can access any local variables from that scope.  Event  handlers  registered  as  HTML  attributes  are  a  special case, however. They are converted into top-level functions that  Event Handler Invocation  219   have access to global variables but not to any local variables. But,  for  historical  reasons,  they  run  with  a  modified  scope chain. Event handlers defined by HTML attributes can use the properties of the target object, the containing   object  if there is one , and the Document object as if they are local vari- ables. “Setting Event Handler Attributes” on page 216 shows how an event handler function is created from an HTML event handler attribute, and the code there approximates this modi- fied scope chain using with statements. HTML attributes are not natural places to include long strings of code, and this modified scope chain allows helpful short- cuts. You can use tagName instead of this.tagName. You can use getElementById instead of document.getElementById. And, for document elements that are inside a  , you can refer to any other form element by ID, using zipcode, for example, in- stead of this.form.zipcode. On the other hand, the modified scope chain of HTML event handlers is a source of pitfalls, since the properties of each of the  objects  in  the  chain  shadow  any  properties  of  the  same name in the global object. This is a particular problem with forms,  because  the  names  and  IDs  of  form  elements  define properties on the containing form element. So if a form con- tains an element with the ID “location,” for example, all HTML event handlers within that form must use window.location in- stead of  location  if they want to refer to the window’s Loca- tion object.  Handler Return Value The return value of an event handler registered by setting an object property or an HTML attribute is sometimes significant. In  general,  a  return  value  of  false  tells  the  browser  that  it should  not  perform  the  default  action  associated  with  the event. The onclick handler of a Submit button in a form, for example, can return false to prevent the browser from sub- mitting the form.  This is useful if the user’s input fails client- side validation.  Similarly, an onkeypress handler on an input  220  Chapter 12: Handling Events   field can filter keyboard input by returning false if the user types an inappropriate character.  The return value of the onbeforeunload handler of the Window object  is  also  significant.  This  event  is  triggered  when  the browser is about to navigate to a new page. If this event handler returns a string, it will be displayed in a modal dialog box that asks the user to confirm that she wants to leave the page.  It is important to understand that event handler return values are significant only for handlers registered as properties. We’ll see  below  that  event  handlers  registered  with  addEventLis tener   must instead call the preventDefault   method of the event object.  Event Propagation When the target of an event is the Window object, or some other  standalone  object   such  as  an  XMLHttpRequest ,  the browser responds to an event simply by invoking the appro- priate handlers on that one object. When the event target is a Document  or  document  Element,  however,  the  situation  is more complicated.  After the event handlers registered on the target element are invoked, most events “bubble” up the DOM tree. The event handlers of the target’s parent are invoked. Then the handlers registered on the target’s grandparent are invoked. This con- tinues  up  to  the  Document  object,  and  then  beyond  to  the Window object. Event bubbling provides an alternative to reg- istering handlers on lots of individual document elements: in- stead you can register a single handler on a common ancestor element  and  handle  events  there.  You  might  register  a “change” handler on a   element, for example, instead of registering a “change” handler for every element in the form.  Most events that occur on document elements bubble. Notable exceptions are the focus, blur, and scroll events. The load event on document elements bubbles, but it stops bubbling at the Document object and does not propagate on to the Window  Event Handler Invocation  221   object. The load event of the Window object is triggered only when the entire document has loaded.  Event bubbling is the third “phase” of event propagation. The invocation of the event handlers of the target object itself is the second phase. The first phase, which occurs even before the target handlers are invoked, is called the “capturing” phase. Recall  that  addEventListener    takes  a  boolean  value  as  its third argument. If that argument is true, the event handler is registered as a capturing event handler for invocation during this first phase of event propagation.  The capturing phase of event propagation is like the bubbling phase in reverse. The capturing handlers of the Window object are invoked first, then the capturing handlers of the Document object, then of the body object, and so on down the DOM tree until the capturing event handlers of the parent of the event target are invoked. Capturing event handlers registered on the event target itself are not invoked.  Event capturing provides an opportunity to peek at events be- fore they are delivered to their target. A capturing event handler can be used for debugging, or it can be used along with the event cancellation technique described below to filter events so that the target event handlers are never actually invoked. One common use for event capturing is handling mouse drags, where mouse motion events need to be handled by the object being  dragged,  not  the  document  elements  over  which  it  is dragged.  Event Cancellation “Handler Return Value” on page 220 explained that the return value of event handlers registered as properties can be used to cancel the browser’s default action for the event. You can also cancel the default action for an event by invoking the prevent Default   method of the event object. Canceling the default action associated with an event is only one  kind  of  event  cancellation.  We  can  also  cancel  the  222  Chapter 12: Handling Events   propagation  of  events.  Event  objects  have  a  stopPropaga tion   method that you can invoke to prevent the continued propagation of the event. If there are other handlers defined on the same object, the rest of those handlers will still be invoked, but no event handlers on any other object will be invoked after stopPropagation   is called. The  stop  Propagation    method can be called at any time during event propagation. It works during the capturing phase, at the event target itself, and during the  bubbling  phase.  Another  method  on  the  Event  object, named stopImmediatePropagation  , prevents the propagation of the event to any other objects and also prevents the invoca- tion of any other event handlers registered on the same object.  Event Handler Invocation  223    CHAPTER 13 Networking  This  chapter  describes  four  techniques  for  client-side  Java- Script  networking.  The  first,  XMLHttpRequest,  is  well-known and widely-used in the “Ajax” application architecture. This API is by far the most important of the four, and the bulk of the chapter is devoted to it. The chapter also demonstrates the JSONP  technique  for  Ajax-style  networking  with  the   tag, as well as “server push” or “Comet” style net- working  with  the  new  EventSource  API,  and  bidirectional socket-style networking with WebSockets.  Using XMLHttpRequest Browsers define their HTTP API on an XMLHttpRequest class. Each instance of this class represents a single HTTP request  response pair, and the properties and methods of the object allow you to specify request details and extract response data. XMLHttpRequest is often abbreviated as XHR, and this chap- ter uses the term XHR2 to refer to cutting-edge features intro- duced by drafts of version 2 of the XHR specification. Note that the XMLHttpRequest API has nothing to do with XML: the name is a historical accident that we’re simply stuck with.  The first step in using the XHR API, of course, is to instantiate an XMLHttpRequest object:  225   var request = new XMLHttpRequest  ;  You can also reuse an existing XMLHttpRequest object, but note that doing so will abort any request pending through that object.  Any HTTP request consists of four parts:    the HTTP request method or “verb”   the URL being requested   an optional set of request headers, which may include au-  thentication information   an optional request body  The HTTP response sent by a server has three parts:    a numeric and textual status code that indicates the suc-  cess or failure of the request    a set of response headers   the response body  The first two subsections below demonstrate how to set each of the parts of an HTTP request and how to query each of the parts of an HTTP response with the XHR API. Those key sec- tions are followed by coverage of more specialized topics.  XMLHttpRequest and Local Files  The ability to use relative URLs in web pages usually means that we can develop and test our HTML using the local file system and then deploy it unchanged to a web server. This is generally  not  possible  when  doing  Ajax  programming  with XMLHttpRequest, however. XMLHttpRequest is designed to work with the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, not the file:   protocol. This means that when working with XMLHttpRe- quest, you generally have to upload your files to a web server  or run a server locally  in order to test them.  The basic request response architecture of HTTP is pretty sim- ple and easy to work with. In practice, however, there are all  226  Chapter 13: Networking   sorts  of  complications:  clients  and  server  exchange  cookies, servers redirect browsers to other servers, some resources are cached and others are not, some clients send all their requests through proxy servers, and so on. XMLHttpRequest is not a protocol-level HTTP API but instead a browser-level API. The browser takes care of cookies, redirects, caching, and proxies and your code need worry only about requests and responses.  Specifying the Request After  creating  an  XMLHttpRequest  object,  the  next  step  in making an HTTP request is to call the open   method of your XMLHttpRequest object to specify the two required parts of the request, the method and the URL:  request.open "GET",          Begin a HTTP GET request              "data.csv" ;    For the contents of this URL The first argument to open   specifies the HTTP method or verb. The “GET” and “POST” methods are universally sup- ported. “GET” is used for most “regular” requests, and it is appropriate when the URL completely specifies the requested resource, when the request has no side effects on the server, and  when  the  server’s  response  is  cacheable.  The  “POST” method includes additional data in the request body and that data is often stored in a database on the server  a side effect .  In  addition  to  “GET”  and  “POST”,  the  XMLHttpRequest specification also allows “DELETE,” “HEAD,” “OPTIONS,” and “PUT” as the first argument to open  . The second argument to open   is the URL that is the subject of the request. This is relative to the URL of the document that contains the script that is calling open  . If you specify an ab- solute URL, the protocol, host, and port must generally match those of the containing document: cross-origin HTTP requests normally  cause  an  error.   But  the  XHR2  allows  cross-origin requests when the server explicitly allows it; see “Cross-Origin HTTP Requests” on page 232.   Using XMLHttpRequest   227   The next step in the request process is to set the request head- ers, if any. “POST” requests, for example, need a “Content- Type” header to specify the MIME type of the request body:  request.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "text plain" ;  If  you  call  setRequestHeader    multiple  times  for  the  same header, the new value does not replace the previously specified value: instead, the HTTP request will include multiple copies of the header or the header will specify multiple values.  You cannot specify the “Content-Length,” “Date,” “Referer,” or “User-Agent” headers yourself: XMLHttpRequest will add those automatically for you and will not allow you to spoof them. Similarly, XMLHttpRequest object automatically han- dles cookies, and connection lifetime, charset, and encoding negotiations, so you’re not allowed to set any of those headers either.  The final step in making an HTTP request with XMLHttpRe- quest is to specify the optional request body and send it off to the server. Do this with the send   method:  request.send null ;  GET requests never have a body, so you should pass null or omit the argument. POST requests do generally have a body, and it should match the “Content-Type” header you specified with setRequestHeader  . Example  13-1  uses  each  of  the  XMLHttpRequest  methods we’ve described so far. It POSTs a string of text to a server and ignores any response the server sends. Note that the string sent in the request body may be a complex one: it might be a Java- Script  object  encoded  with  JSON.stringify    or  a  form- encoded set of name value pairs.  Example 13-1. POSTing plain text to a server  function postMessage msg  {     var r = new XMLHttpRequest  ;    New request     r.open "POST", " log.php" ;      POST to this URL        Specify that the request body is UTF8 text     r.setRequestHeader "Content-Type",  228  Chapter 13: Networking                          "text plain;charset=UTF-8" ;        Send msg as the request body     r.send msg ;          Ignore any response or any error.     }  Note that the send   method in Example 13-1 initiates the re- quest and then returns: it does not block while waiting for the server’s  response.  HTTP  responses  are  asynchronous,  as demonstrated in the following section.  Retrieving the Response A complete HTTP response consists of a status code, a set of  response  headers,  and  a  response  body.  These  are  available through  properties  and  methods  of  the  XMLHttpRequest object:    The status and statusText properties return the HTTP status in numeric and textual forms. These properties hold standard HTTP values like 200 and “OK” for successful requests, and 404 and “Not Found” for URLs that don’t match any resource on the server.    The  response  headers  can  be  queried  with  getResponse  Header   and getAllResponseHeaders  .    The response body is available in textual form from the   responseText property.  The  XMLHttpRequest  object  is  used  asynchronously:  the send   method returns immediately after sending the request, and the response methods and properties listed above aren’t valid until the response is received. To be notified when the response is ready, you must listen for readystatechange events  or the new XHR2 progress events described in “HTTP Pro- gress Events” on page 231  on the XMLHttpRequest object. But to understand this event type, you must first understand the readyState property. readyState is an integer that specifies the status of an HTTP request, and its possible values are the following:  Using XMLHttpRequest   229   Value Meaning 0 1 2 3 4  open   has not been called yet open   has been called Headers have been received The response body is being received The response is complete  To  listen  for  readystatechange  events,  set  the  onreadystate change property of the XMLHttpRequest object to your event handler  function.   Or  call  addEventListener   .  Exam- ple 13-2 defines a getText   function that demonstrates how to listen for readystatechange events. The event handler first ensures  that  the  request  is  complete.  If  so,  it  checks  the  re- sponse status code to ensure that the request was successful. Then it looks at the “Content-Type” header to verify that the response was of the expected type. If all three conditions are satisfied, it passes the response body  as text  to a specified callback  function.  That  callback  could  then  process  the  re- sponse further, by passing it to JSON.parse  , for example.  Example 13-2. Getting an HTTP response onreadystatechange     Issue an HTTP GET request for the specified URL.    When the response arrives successfully, verify    that it is plain text and if so, pass it the text    to the specified callback function function getText url, callback  {     var r = new XMLHttpRequest  ;    New request     r.open "GET", url ;              Specify URL     r.onreadystatechange = function   {            If the request is compete and was successful         if  r.readyState === 4 && r.status === 200  {             var type = r.getResponseHeader "Content-Type" ;                If response is text, pass it to callback             if  type.match  ^text                    callback r.responseText ;         }     };     r.send null ;                    Send the request! }  230  Chapter 13: Networking   HTTP Progress Events In the examples above, we’ve used the readystatechange event to detect the completion of an HTTP request. The XHR2 draft specification defines a more useful set of events. In this new event  model,  the  XMLHttpRequest  object  triggers  different types of events at different phases of the request so that it is no longer necessary to check the readyState property. In browsers that support them, these new events are triggered as follows. When the send   method is called, a single loadstart event is fired. While the server’s response is being downloaded, the  XMLHttpRequest  object  fires  progress  events,  typically every 50 milliseconds or so, and you can use these events to give the user feedback about the progress of the request. If a request  completes  very  quickly,  it  may  never  fire  a  progress event. When a request is complete, a load event is fired.  A complete request is not necessarily a successful request, and your handler for the load event should check the status code of the XMLHttpRequest object to ensure that you received an HTTP “200 OK” response rather than a “404 Not Found” re- sponse, for example.  There are three ways that an HTTP request can fail to complete, and  three  corresponding  events.  If  a  request  times  out,  the timeout event is triggered. If a request is aborted, the abort event is triggered. Finally, other network errors, such as too many redirects, can prevent the completion of a request, and the error event is triggered when this happens.  The  event  object  associated  with  these  progress  events  has three useful properties in addition to the normal Event object properties like type and timestamp. The loaded property is the number of bytes that have been transferred so far. The total property is the total length  in bytes  of the data to be trans- ferred, from the “Content-Length” header, or 0 if the content length is not known. Finally, the lengthComputable property is true  if  the  content  length  is  known  and  is  false  otherwise.  Using XMLHttpRequest   231   Obviously,  the  total  and  loaded  properties  are  particularly useful in progress event handlers:  request.onprogress = function e  {     if  e.lengthComputable  {         var p = Math.round 100*e.loaded e.total ;         progress.innerHTML = p + "% Complete";     } }  In addition to defining these useful events for monitoring the download of an HTTP response, XHR2 also allows the events to  be  used  to  monitor  the  upload  of  an  HTTP  request.  In browsers that have implemented this feature, the XMLHttpRe- quest  object  will  have  an  upload  property.  The  value  of  the upload  property  is  an  object  that  defines  an  addEventLis tener   method and defines a full set of progress event prop- erties, such as onprogress and onload. You can use the upload event handlers just as you would use the regular progress event handlers. For an XMLHttpRequest object x, set x.onprogress to monitor the download progress of the response. And set x.upload.onprogress to monitor the upload progress of the request.  Cross-Origin HTTP Requests As part of the same-origin security policy  “The Same-Origin Policy” on page 176 , the XMLHttpRequest object can nor- mally issue HTTP requests only to the server from which the document that uses it was downloaded. This restriction closes security holes, but it is heavy-handed and also prevents a num- ber of legitimate uses for cross-origin requests. You can use  cross-origin URLs with   and   elements, and the browser will display the resulting cross-origin document. But because of the same-origin policy, the browser won’t allow the original script to inspect the contents of the cross-origin docu- ment. With XMLHttpRequest, document contents are always exposed through the responseText property, so the same-origin policy cannot allow XMLHttpRequest to make cross-origin re- quests.  Note that the   element has never really been  232  Chapter 13: Networking   subject to the same-origin policy: it will download and execute any  script,  regardless  of  origin.  As  we’ll  see  in  “HTTP  by  : JSONP” on page 233, this freedom to make cross- origin requests makes the   element an attractive Ajax transport alternative to XMLHttpRequest.   XHR2 allows cross-origin requests to websites that opt-in by sending appropriate CORS  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  headers in their HTTP responses. As a web programmer, there is  nothing  special  you  need  to  do  to  make  this  work:  if  the browser supports CORS for XMLHttpRequest and if the web- site you are trying to make a cross-origin request to has decided to allow cross-origin requests with CORS, the same-origin pol- icy will be relaxed and your cross-origin requests will just work.  HTTP by  : JSONP For certain kinds of content, a   element can be used as  a  useful  alternative  to  XMLHttpRequest.  Simply  set  the src attribute of a    and insert it into the document if it isn’t already there  and the browser will generate an HTTP request to download the URL you specify.   elements are useful Ajax transports for one primary reason: they are not subject to the same-origin policy, so you can use them to re- quest data from servers other than your own.  The technique of using a   element as an Ajax transport has come to be known as JSONP: it works when the response body of the HTTP request is JSON-encoded. The “P” stands for “padding” or “prefix”—this will be explained in a moment.  Suppose you’ve written a service that handles GET requests and returns JSON-encoded data. Same-origin documents can use it with XMLHttpRequest and JSON.parse  . If you enable CORS on your server, cross-origin documents in new browsers can also use your service with XMLHttpRequest. Cross-origin documents in older browsers that do not support CORS can only  access  your  service  with  a     element,  however. Your JSON response body is  by definition  valid JavaScript  HTTP by  : JSONP  233   code, and the browser will execute it when it arrives. Executing JSON-encoded data decodes it, but the result is still just data, and it doesn’t do anything.  This is where the P part of JSONP comes in. When invoked through a   element, your service must “pad” its re- sponse by surrounding it with parentheses and prefixing it with the name of a JavaScript function. Instead of just sending JSON data like this:  [1, 2, {"buckle": "my shoe"}]  It sends a padded-JSON response like this:  handleResponse  [1, 2, {"buckle": "my shoe"}]    As the body of a   element, this padded response does something  valuable:  it  evaluates  the  JSON-encoded  data  which is nothing more than one big JavaScript expression, af- ter all  and then passes it to the function  handleResponse  , which, we assume, the containing document has defined to do something useful with the data.  In order for this to work, we have to have some way to tell the service that it is being invoked from a   element and must send a JSONP response instead of a plain JSON response. This can be done by adding a query parameter to the URL: appending ?json  or &json , for example. In practice, services that support JSONP do not dictate a func- tion name like “handleResponse” that all clients must imple- ment. Instead, they use the value of a query parameter to allow the client to specify a function name, and then use that function name  as  the  padding  in  the  response.  Example  13-3  uses  a query  parameter  named  “jsonp”  to  specify  the  name  of  the callback function.  Example  13-3  defines  a  function  getJSONP    that  makes  a JSONP request. This example is a little tricky, and there are some things you should note about it. First, notice how it cre- ates a new   element, sets its URL, and inserts it into  234  Chapter 13: Networking   the document. It is this insertion that triggers the HTTP re- quest. Second, notice that the example creates a new internal callback function for each request, storing the function as a property of getJSONP   itself. Finally, note that callback per- forms some necessary cleanup: it removes the script element and deletes itself.  Example 13-3. Making a JSONP request with a script element     Make a JSONP request to the specified URL and    pass the parsed response data to the specified    callback. Add a query parameter named "jsonp" to    the URL to specify the name of the callback    function for the request. function getJSONP url, callback  {        Create a unique callback name for this request        The name will be a property of this function.     var cbnum = "cb" + getJSONP.counter++;     var cbname = "getJSONP." + cbnum;             Add the callback name to the url query string.     if  url.indexOf "?"  === -1          url += "?jsonp=" + cbname;     else                                  url += "&jsonp=" + cbname;          Create the script element for this request     var script = document.createElement "script" ;         Define the callback function that we named above.     getJSONP[cbnum] = function response  {         try {             callback response ;    Handle the response         }         finally {    Always clean up, even on error             delete getJSONP[cbnum];                             script.parentNode.removeChild script ;         }     };         Now trigger the HTTP request     script.src = url;          document.body.appendChild script ; }  HTTP by  : JSONP  235      The counter used to assign callback names getJSONP.counter = 0;  Scripts and Security  In order to use a   element as an Ajax transport, you have to allow your web page to run whatever JavaScript code the remote server chooses to send you. This means that you must  not  use  the  technique  described  here  with  untrusted servers. And when you do use it with trusted servers, keep in mind  that  if  an  attacker  can  hack  into  that  server,  then  the hacker can take over your web page, run any code she wants and display any content she wants, and that content will ap- pear to come from your site.  With that said, note that it has become commonplace for web- sites  to  use  trusted  third-party  scripts,  especially  to  embed advertising or “widgets” into a page. Using a   as an Ajax transport to communicate with a trusted web service is no more dangerous than that.  Server-Sent Events In normal HTTP networking with XHR or the   tag, the client requests or “pulls” data from the server when it needs it. There is another style of HTTP-based networking that is used by some web applications. In “server push” or “comet,” the client and server establish an HTTP connection, but leave it open indefinitely, which allows the server to push data to the client through that open connection.  It is possible but difficult to implement this style of networking with  XHR,  but  a  new  HTML5-related  standard  known  as Server-Sent  Events  defines  a  simple  EventSource  API  that makes it trivial to receive and respond to messages pushed by the server. To use Server-Sent Events, simply pass a URL to the EventSource   constructor and then listen for message events on the returned object:  236  Chapter 13: Networking   var ticker = new EventSource "stockprices.php" ; ticker.onmessage = function e  {     var type = e.type;       var data = e.data;         Now process the event type and event data strings. }  The event object associated with a message event has a data property that holds whatever string the server sent as the pay- load for this event. The event object also has a type property like all event objects do. The default value is “message,” but the event source can specify a different string for the property. A  single  onmessage  event  handler  receives  all  events  from  a given server event source, and can dispatch them, if necessary, based on their type property. The Server-Sent Event protocol is straightforward. The client initiates  a  connection  to  the  server   when  it  creates  the EventSource object  and the server keeps this connection open. When an event occurs, the server writes lines of text to the connection. An event going over the wire might look like this:  event: bid    event type data: GOOG    sets the data property data: 999     appends newline and more data               blank line triggers the event  WebSockets All of the networking APIs described so far in this chapter are HTTP-based, which means that they are all constrained by the fundamental nature of the HTTP: it is a stateless protocol that consists of client requests and server responses. HTTP is ac- tually a specialized network protocol. More general network protocols often involve longer-lived connections and bidirec- tional message exchange over TCP sockets. It is not safe to give untrusted client-side JavaScript code access to low-level TCP sockets, but the WebSocket API defines a secure alternative: it allows client-side code to create bidirectional socket-type con- nections to servers that support the WebSocket protocol. This  WebSockets   237   makes it much easier to perform certain kinds of networking tasks.  The WebSocket API is surprisingly easy to use. First, create a socket with the WebSocket   constructor:  var s = new WebSocket "ws:  ws.example.com resource" ;  The argument to the WebSocket   constructor is a URL that uses the ws:   protocol  or wss:   for a secure connection like that used by https:   . The URL specifies the host to connect to, and may also specify a port  WebSockets use the same default ports as HTTP and HTTPS  and a path or resource.  Once you have created a socket, you generally register event handlers on it:  s.onopen = function e  {   * The socket is open. *  }; s.onclose = function e  {  * The socket closed. *  }; s.onerror = function e  {  * Something went wrong! *  }; s.onmessage = function e  {      var m = e.data;   * The server sent a message. *  };  In order to send data to the server over the socket, you call the  send   method of the socket: s.send "Hello, server!" ;  When your code is done communicating with the server, you can close a WebSocket by calling its close   method. WebSocket communication is completely bidirectional. Once a WebSocket connection has been established, the client and server can send messages to each other at any time, and that communication does not have to take the form of requests and responses.  238  Chapter 13: Networking   CHAPTER 14 Client-Side Storage  Web applications can use browser APIs to store data locally on the user’s computer. This client-side storage serves to give the web browser a memory. Web apps can store user preferences, for example, or even store their complete state, so that they can resume exactly where you left off at the end of your last visit. Client-side storage is segregated by origin, so pages from one site can’t read the data stored by pages from another site. But two pages from the same site can share storage and can use it as a communication mechanism. Data input in a form on one page can be displayed in a table on another page, for example. Web applications can choose the lifetime of the data they store: data can be stored temporarily so that it is retained only until the window closes or the browser exits, or it can be saved to the hard drive and stored permanently, so that it is available months or years later. This chapter covers two forms of client- side  storage:  the  modern  Web  Storage  API  and  the  ancient Cookies API.  Storage, Security, and Privacy  Web browsers often offer to remember web passwords for you, and they store them safely in encrypted form on the disk. But none of the forms of client-side data storage described in this chapter involve encryption: anything you save resides on the user’s hard disk in unencrypted form. Stored data is therefore  239   accessible to curious users who share access to the computer and to malicious software  such as spyware  that exists on the computer.  For  this  reason,  no  form  of  client-side  storage should ever be used for passwords, financial account numbers, or other similarly sensitive information.  Also, bear in mind that many web users mistrust websites that use cookies or other client-side storage mechanisms to do any- thing that resembles “tracking.” Try to use the storage mech- anisms discussed in this chapter to enhance a user’s experience at your site; don’t use them as a privacy-invading data collec- tion mechanism. If too many sites abuse client-side storage, users will disable it or clear it frequently, which will defeat the purpose and cripple the sites that depend on it.  localStorage and sessionStorage Browsers that implement the “Web Storage” draft specifica- tion define two properties on the Window object: localStor age and sessionStorage. Both properties refer to a Storage ob- ject—a  persistent  associative  array  that  maps  string  keys  to string  values.  Storage  objects  work  much  like  regular  Java- Script objects: simply set a property of the object to a string, and the browser will store that string for you. The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with life- time and scope: how long the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to.  Storage lifetime and scope are explained in more detail below. First,  however,  let’s  look  at  some  examples.  The  following code  uses  localStorage,  but  it  would  also  work  with sessionStorage:     Query a stored value. var name = localStorage.username;     The array notation equivalent name = localStorage["username"];   if  !name  {    If no name stored, get one and store it     name = prompt "What is your name?" ;     localStorage.username = name;  240  Chapter 14: Client-Side Storage   }     Iterate through all stored name value pairs for var key in localStorage  {     var value = localStorage[key]; }  Storage objects also define methods for storing, retrieving, iter- ating, and deleting data. Those methods are covered in “Stor- age API” on page 243.  The Web Storage draft specification says that we should be able to store structured data  objects and arrays  as well as primitive values and built-in types such as dates, regular expressions, and even File objects. At the time of this writing, however, browsers only allow the storage of strings. If you want to store and re- trieve other kinds of data, you’ll have to encode and decode it yourself. For example:     Stored numbers are automatically converted to strings.    You must parse it when retrieving it from storage. localStorage.x = 10; var x = parseInt localStorage.x ;     Convert a Date to a string when setting it. localStorage.lastRead =  new Date   .toUTCString  ;    And parse it when getting. var last = new Date Date.parse localStorage.lastRead  ;     Use JSON to stringify and parse objects and arrays. localStorage.data = JSON.stringify data ; var data = JSON.parse localStorage.data ;  Storage Lifetime and Scope The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage in- volves  the  lifetime  and  scope  of  the  storage.  Data  stored through localStorage is permanent: it does not expire and re- mains stored on the user’s computer until a web app deletes it or the user asks the browser  through some browser-specific UI  to delete it.  localStorage is scoped to the document origin. As explained in  “The  Same-Origin  Policy”  on  page  176,  the  origin  of  a  localStorage and sessionStorage  241   document is defined by its protocol, hostname, and port, so each of the following URLs has a different origin:  http:  www.example.com https:  www.example.com          Different protocol http:  static.example.com        Different hostname http:  www.example.com:8000      Different port  All documents with the same origin share the same localStor age data  regardless of the origin of the scripts that actually access  localStorage .  They  can  read  each  other’s  data.  And they can overwrite each other’s data. But documents with dif- ferent  origins  can  never  read  or  overwrite  each  other’s  data  even if they’re both running a script from the same third-party server .  Note that localStorage is also scoped by browser vendor. If you visit a site using Firefox, and then visit again using Chrome  for example , any data stored during the first visit will not be accessible during the second visit.  Data  stored  through  sessionStorage  has  a  different  lifetime than data stored through localStorage: it has the same lifetime as the top-level window or browser tab in which the script that stored it is running. When the window or tab is permanently closed,  any  data  stored  through  sessionStorage  is  deleted.  Note, however, that modern browsers have the ability to re- open recently closed tabs and restore the last browsing session, so the lifetime of these tabs and their associated sessionStor age may be longer than it seems.  Like localStorage, sessionStorage is scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share sessionStorage. But sessionStorage is also scoped on a per- window basis. If a user has two browser tabs displaying docu- ments from the same origin, those two tabs have separate ses sionStorage data: the scripts running in one tab cannot read or overwrite the data written by scripts in the other tab, even if both tabs are visiting exactly the same page and are running exactly the same scripts.  242  Chapter 14: Client-Side Storage   Note that this window-based scoping of sessionStorage is only for  top-level  windows.  If  one  browser  tab  contains  two   elements, and those frames hold two documents with the  same  origin,  those  two  framed  documents  will  share sessionStorage.  Storage API localStorage and sessionStorage are often used as if they were regular JavaScript objects: set a property to store a string and query the property to retrieve it. But these objects also define a more formal method-based API. To store a value, pass the name and value to setItem  . To retrieve a value, pass the name to  getItem  .  To  delete  a  value,  pass  the  name  to removeItem  .  In most browsers you can also use the delete operator to remove a value, just as you would for an ordinary object, but this technique does not work in IE8.  To delete all stored  values,  call  clear     with  no  arguments .  Finally,  to enumerate the names of all stored values, use the length prop- erty and pass numbers from 0 to length–1 to the key   method. Here are some examples using localStorage. The same code would work using sessionStorage instead:  localStorage.setItem "x", 1 ;    Store an item "x" localStorage.getItem "x" ;       Retrieve its value     Enumerate all stored name value pairs    Length gives the  of pairs for var i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++  {          Get the name of pair i     var name = localStorage.key i ;                     Get the value of that pair     var value = localStorage.getItem name ; }  localStorage.removeItem "x" ;    Delete the item "x" localStorage.clear  ;    Delete any other items, too  localStorage and sessionStorage  243   Storage Events Whenever the data stored in localStorage or sessionStorage changes,  the  browser  triggers  a  storage  event  on  any  other Window objects to which that data is visible  but not on the window that made the change . If a browser has two tabs open to pages with the same origin, and one of those pages stores a value in localStorage, the other tab will receive a storage event. Remember that sessionStorage is scoped to the top-level win- dow, so storage events are only triggered for sessionStorage changes when there are frames involved. Also note that storage events are only triggered when storage actually changes. Set- ting an existing stored item to its current value does not trigger an  event,  nor  does  removing  an  item  that  does  not  exist  in storage.  Register a handler for storage events with addEventListener    or attachEvent   in IE . In most browsers, you can also set the  onstorage property of the Window object, but at the time of this writing, Firefox does not support that property.  The  event  object  associated  with  a  storage  event  has  five important  properties   they  are  not  supported  by  IE8, unfortunately :  key  newValue  oldValue  storageArea  The name or key of the item that was set or removed. If the clear   method was called, this property will be null.  Holds the new value of the item, or null if removeItem   was called.  Holds the old value of an existing item that changed or was deleted, or null if a new item was inserted.  This  property  will  equal  either  the  localStorage  or  the sessionStorage property of the target Window object.  244  Chapter 14: Client-Side Storage   url  The URL  as a string  of the document whose script made this storage change.  Finally, note that localStorage and the storage event can serve as a broadcast mechanism by which a browser sends a message to all windows that are currently visiting the same website. If a user requests that a website stop performing animations, for example, the site might store that preference in localStorage so that it can honor it in future visits. And by storing the pref- erence, it generates an event that allows other windows dis- playing the same site to honor the request as well. As another example, imagine a web-based image editing application that allows the user to display tool palettes in separate windows. When the user selects a tool, the application uses localStor age to save the current state and to generate a notification to other windows that a new tool has been selected.  Cookies A cookie is a small amount of named data stored by the web browser and associated with a particular web page or website. Cookies were originally designed for server-side programming, and at the lowest level, they are implemented as an extension to the HTTP protocol. Cookie data is automatically transmit- ted between the web browser and web server, so server-side scripts can read and write cookie values that are stored on the client. This section demonstrates how client-side scripts can also manipulate cookies using the cookie property of the Docu- ment object.  The API for manipulating cookies is an old one, which means that it is universally supported. Unfortunately, the API is also cryptic. There are no methods involved: cookies are queried, set, and deleted by reading and writing the cookie property of the  Document  object  using  specially  formatted  strings.  The lifetime and scope of each cookie can be individually specified  Cookies   245   with cookie attributes. These attributes are also specified with specially formatted strings set on the same cookie property. The subsections that follow explain the cookie attributes that specify lifetime and scope, and then demonstrate how to set and query cookie values in JavaScript.  Cookie Attributes: Lifetime and Scope In addition to a name and a value, each cookie has optional attributes that control its lifetime and scope. Cookies are tran- sient by default; the values they store last for the duration of the web browser session but are lost when the user exits the browser. Note that this is a subtly different lifetime than ses sionStorage: cookies are not scoped to a single window, and their default lifetime is the same as the entire browser process, not the lifetime of any one window. If you want a cookie to last beyond a single browsing session, you must tell the browser how long  in seconds  you would like it to retain the cookie by specifying  a  max-age  attribute.  If  you  specify  a  lifetime,  the browser will store cookies in a file and delete them only once they expire.  Cookie visibility is scoped by document origin as  localStor age and sessionStorage are, and also by document path. This scope is configurable through cookie attributes path and do- main. By default, a cookie is associated with, and accessible to, the web page that created it and any other web pages in the same directory or any subdirectories of that directory. If the web page http:  www.example.com catalog index.html creates a cookie, for example, that cookie is also visible to http:  www .example.com catalog order.html  and  http:  www.example .com catalog widgets index.html, but it is not visible to http:   www.example.com about.html.  This default visibility behavior is often exactly what you want. Sometimes, though, you’ll want to use cookie values through- out a website, regardless of which page creates the cookie. For instance, if the user enters his mailing address in a form on one page, you may want to save that address to use as the default  246  Chapter 14: Client-Side Storage   the next time he returns to the page and also as the default in an entirely unrelated form on another page where he is asked to enter a billing address. To allow this usage, you specify a path for the cookie. Then, any web page from the same web server whose URL begins with the path prefix you specified can share the cookie. For example, if a cookie set by http:  www .example.com catalog widgets index.html  has  its  path  set  to “ catalog,”  that  cookie  is  also  visible  to  http:  www.example .com catalog order.html. Or, if the path is set to “ ,” the cookie is  visible  to  any  page  on  the  http:  www.example.com  web server.  Setting the path of a cookie to “ ” gives scoping like that of localStorage and also specifies that the browser must transmit the cookie name and value to the server whenever it requests any web page on the site.  By default, cookies are scoped by document origin. Large web- sites may want cookies to be shared across subdomains, how- ever. For example, the server at order.example.com may need to  read  cookie  values  set  from  catalog.example.com.  This  is where the domain attribute comes in. If a cookie created by a page on catalog.example.com sets its path attribute to “ ” and its domain attribute to “.example.com,” that cookie is available to  all  web  pages  on  catalog.example.com,  orders.exam- ple.com, and any other server in the example.com domain. If the domain attribute is not set for a cookie, the default is the hostname of the web server that serves the page. Note that you cannot set the domain of a cookie to a domain other than the domain of your server.  The final cookie attribute is a boolean attribute named secure that specifies how cookie values are transmitted over the net- work. By default, cookies are insecure, which means that they are transmitted over a normal, insecure HTTP connection. If a cookie is marked secure, however, it is transmitted only when the browser and server are connected via HTTPS or another secure protocol.  Cookies   247   Setting Cookies To associate a transient cookie value with the current docu- ment, simply set the cookie property to a string of the form:  name=value For example:  var v = encodeURIComponent document.lastModified ; document.cookie = "version=" + v;  The next time you read the cookie property, the name value pair you stored is included in the list of cookies for the docu- ment. Cookie values cannot include semicolons, commas, or  whitespace.  For  this  reason,  you  may  want  to  use  the  core JavaScript global function encodeURIComponent   to encode the value before storing it in the cookie.  A cookie written with a simple name value pair lasts for the current web-browsing session but is lost when the user exits the browser. To create a cookie that can last across browser sessions,  specify  its  lifetime   in  seconds   with  a  max-age  at- tribute. You can do this by setting the  cookie property to a string of the form:  name=value; max-age=seconds  The  following  function  sets  a  cookie  with  an  optional  max- age attribute:     Store the name value pair as a cookie, encoding    the value with encodeURIComponent   in order to    escape semicolons, commas, and spaces.    If daysToLive is a number, set the max-age attribute    so that the cookie expires after the specified    number of days. Pass 0 to delete a cookie. function setCookie name, value, daysToLive  {     var cookie = name + "=" + encodeURIComponent value ;     if  typeof daysToLive === "number"           cookie += "; max-age=" +  daysToLive*60*60*24 ;     document.cookie = cookie; }  248  Chapter 14: Client-Side Storage   Similarly, you can set the path, domain, and secure attributes of a cookie by appending strings of the following format to the cookie value before that value is written to the cookie property:  ; path=path ; domain=domain ; secure  To change the value of a cookie, set its value again using the same name, path, and domain along with the new value. You can change the lifetime of a cookie when you change its value by specifying a new max-age attribute. To delete a cookie, set it again using the same name, path, and domain, specifying an arbitrary  or empty  value, and a max- age attribute of 0.  Reading Cookies When you use the cookie property in a JavaScript expression, the value it returns is a string that contains all the cookies that apply to the current document. The string is a list of name = value pairs separated from each other by a semicolon and a space. The cookie value does not include any of the attributes that may have been set for the cookie. In order to make use of the  document.cookie  property,  you  must  typically  call  the split   method to break it into individual name-value pairs. Once  you  have  extracted  the  value  of  a  cookie  from  the cookie property, you must interpret that value based on what- ever format or encoding was used by the cookie’s creator. You might, for example, pass the cookie value to decodeURICompo nent   and then to JSON.parse  . Example 14-1 defines a getCookie   function that parses the document.cookie property and returns an object whose prop- erties specify the name and values of the document’s cookies.  Example 14-1. Parsing the document.cookies property     Return the document's cookies as an object of    name value pairs. Assume that cookie values    are encoded with encodeURIComponent  .  Cookies   249   function getCookies   {     var cookies = {};    The object we return     var all = document.cookie;    All cookies     if  all === ""     If empty         return cookies;    return an empty object        Split string into name=value pairs     var list = all.split "; " ;         Loop through the name=value pairs     for var i = 0; i < list.length; i++  {         var cookie = list[i];            Split each pair at the = sign         var p = cookie.indexOf "=" ;         var name = cookie.substring 0,p ;         var value = cookie.substring p+1 ;            Store the name and decoded value         cookies[name] = decodeURIComponent value ;     }     return cookies; }  Cookie Limitations Cookies are intended for storage of small amounts of data by server-side  scripts,  and  that  data  is  transferred  to  the  server each time a relevant URL is requested. The standard that de- fines cookies encourages browser manufacturers to allow un- limited numbers of cookies of unrestricted size but does not require  browsers  to  retain  more  than  300  cookies  total,  20 cookies per web server, or 4 KB of data per cookie  both name and value count toward this 4 KB limit . In practice, browsers allow many more than 300 cookies total, but the 4 KB size limit may still be enforced by some.  250  Chapter 14: Client-Side Storage   Index  Symbols ! invert boolean value, 29, 41 ! unary negation operator, 18 != loose inequality not equal  operator, 13, 29, 38  !== strict inequality operator, 29,  37, 82 " "  string , 9 top identifier, 168 $ identifier, 2 $ match end, 157 % modulo operator, 7, 32 & bitwise AND operator, 29, 35 && logical AND, 30, 39 &= operator, 43 ' '  string , 9  ?!   negative lookahead assertion,   ?:   grouping only, 155  ?=   positive lookahead assertion,  * multiplication operator, 7, 29,  157  157  32  * repetition character, 153 * wildcard argument, 185 *= operator, 43 + addition operator, 7, 32  + concatenate strings, 29 + convert to number, 29 + repetition character, 153 + unary plus operator, 18, 33 ++ increment operator, 29, 33,  51  30, 46  ++ pre- post-increment, 29 += operator, 42, 193 , discard 1st operand, return 2nd,  - negate number, 29 - subtraction operator, 7, 33 - unary minus operator, 33 -- decrement operator, 29, 34, 51 -- pre- post-decrement, 29 . dot operator, 14 . value of property, 79   division operator, 7, 32  * *  multi-line comment, 1    single-line comment, 1  [ ]  regular expressions, 152 ; empty statement, 52 ; semicolon, 3 < less than operator, 29, 38 <= less than or equal operator, 29,  38  We’d  like  to  hear  your  suggestions  for  improving  our  indexes.
