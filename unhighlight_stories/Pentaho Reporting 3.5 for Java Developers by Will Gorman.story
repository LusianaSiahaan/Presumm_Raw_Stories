In the ancient  city states of Mesopotamia, the rulers of the fast growing states carved inventory lists  and tax records into stone plates. For the first time in human history this enabled the  management of large distributed empires, armies, and organizations.  Fast-forward a few thousand years, and the art reporting is still in fashion. Even  today reporting drives empires, not ones rules by kings, but empires created by  entrepreneurs as well as large-scale public traded companies. Carving lists and  numbers in stones has been replaced by electrons traveling at the speed of light to  deliver critical information to the leaders of today's business world.  When I first came to JFreeReport, I did not care about the big players. All I needed  was a printing system to create long and boring printouts at reasonable speed and  cost. None of the commercial vendors were able or willing to solve my needs, and  hence I stumbled  quite accidentally  over JFreeReport. After some time extending,  optimizing, and debugging in the reporting engine, I was addicted to it. Eight years  later, the project has changed radically from its early roots. As we grew from simple  printing to fully featured BI-reporting, we left the name "JFreeReport" behind and  became known as "Pentaho Reporting". But this original love has never diminished  and all these years later, the project has grown stronger to now challenge even the  age-old commercial offerings in their own space.  The book you're holding in your hand right now marks an important milestone in  Pentaho Reporting's history. For the very first time, we are now able to point our users,  developers, and partners to a professionally written document that covers all aspects  of the Pentaho reporting engine. After eight years of sending developers into the Java  code to learn how a feature is working, this is a remarkable and welcome change.

As the book guides you from the very simple examples,  to the fully embedded reporting scenarios, the knowledge in the book will guide you  safely through all your tasks so that you can become productive very fast.  Business Reporting should be available for everyone who has a need for it, so take  control of your data.

While  many proprietary reporting options are available, none can offer the openness and  flexibility that Pentaho Reporting provides its users with.   As with most successful open source projects, Pentaho Reporting has a proven track  record, along with a long list of features. Most of this history has been documented in  open forums and in email threads, which are still available for folks to browse through  and glean ideas from. Starting as a side hobby and turning into an enterprise reporting  suite over the course of seven years, the Pentaho Reporting Engine and its suite of  tools such as the Report Designer, Report Design Wizard, and Pentaho's web-based Ad  Hoc Reporting user interface, are used as critical components in countless corporate,  educational, governmental, and community-based information technology solutions.   In most business software applications, a reporting component is necessary, be it   for summarizing data, generating large numbers of customized documents, or  simply for making it easier to print information that would be useful in various  output formats. With a complete set of features, including PDF, Excel, HTML,  and RTF report generation, along with advanced reporting capabilities such as  sub-reports and cross tabs, Pentaho Reporting can crack the simplest of problems  quickly, along with solving the more advanced challenges when designing,  generating and deploying reports.

Typical uses of Pentaho Reporting Business users need access to information in many different forms for many different  reasons. Pentaho Reporting addresses the following typical uses of reporting, along  with many other types that will be covered in this book.  Operational reporting One of the most commonly used forms of reporting is operational reporting. When  a developer or an IT organization decides to generate reports directly from their  operational data sources for the purpose of detailed transaction level reporting, this  is referred to as operational reporting. In this scenario, the database is designed to  solve an operational problem, and usually contains live data supporting critical  business functions. Users of Pentaho Reporting can point directly to this data source  and start generating reports.  Some examples of operational reporting include building custom reports directly  based on a third-party software vendor's database schema such as Bugzilla's bug  tracking system or SugarCRM's Customer Relationship Management system.   These reports might include summaries of daily activity, or detailed views into  particular projects or users in the system. Reports might also be generated from   data originating from an in-house custom application. These reports are typically  based on a SQL backend, but could be generated from flat log files or directly from   in-memory Java objects.  Pentaho Reporting's parameterization capabilities provide a powerful mechanism  to render up-to-the-minute customized operational reports. With features such  as cross tabs and interactive reporting, business users can quickly view their  operational data and drill back into operational systems that might require attention.  There are limitations when developing reports based on live operational data.  Developers need to be careful to make sure that queries in the operational system  do not impact the performance of regular operations. An extremely CPU-intensive  query could delay a transaction from taking place. Also, certain historical questions  —for example, state transitions or changes to particular informational fields such as  address—aren't traditionally captured in an operational schema design.

This move is often referred to as business  intelligence reporting. Reporting alone does not provide the necessary tools to make  this transition. You will need an Extract, Transform, and Load  ETL  tool such as  Pentaho Data Integration, along with a sensible warehouse design such as a snow  flake schema, in order to enable business intelligence reporting.  This type of use allows business users to monitor changes over time. It also helps  gain performance benefits by pre-calculating aggregations and defining schemas  that are built in mind for summarized reporting. Until recently, data warehousing  and business intelligence have been limited to large enterprises due to the cost  of software and limited expertise. With open source tools becoming more widely  available, a large number of small and medium size businesses are deploying data  warehouses, in order to get solutions for the critical questions in their business  domain. Common examples of data warehouse reporting include combining sales  and inventory data into a single location for reporting, or combining internal  proprietary sales data with publicly available market trends and analysis.  Pentaho Reporting's flexible data source support makes it easy to incorporate reports  into your business intelligence solutions. Also, with Pentaho Reporting's speed and  scalability, you can deploy Pentaho Reporting with confidence that reports will be  executed efficiently.  As with all approaches, there are limitations to this approach. In traditional  warehousing, data is usually batched nightly, weekly, or monthly. Therefore,  business users rarely get to see up-to-the-minute reports on business operations.  Also, when designing a warehouse, it is important to ask the correct business  questions. Unfortunately, it is possible to build a data warehouse and still not  address business users’ needs, if not investigated ahead of time.   Financial reporting Financial reporting is a very specific, but very common form of reporting, geared  towards generating financial summaries for accountants, managers, and business  investors. Standard reports that fall into this category include balance sheets, income  statements, retained earning statements, and cash flow statements. Unlike business  intelligence or operational reporting, many of these reports are required by law, with  regulations around their content and presentation. Financial reports often include  computations for assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses.

Typically, this type of data exists in a controlled form, be it in a proprietary system  such as QuickBooks or SAP, or in a secure database system such as Oracle or MySQL.  Due to the sensitivity of this data, developers will need to be conscious of who has  access to reports and may want to implement features such as audit logging.  [ 10 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Production reporting Another typical use of Pentaho Reporting includes production reporting. This type  of reporting includes reports such as a customized form letter, invoice, or postcard  for a large audience, as well as automated mail merging. Normally, batch processing  is involved in this form of reporting. However, custom reports generated for  individuals based on a standard template can also fall under this category.

Pentaho Reporting history Pentaho Reporting began as JFreeReport, a Java-based reporting engine and Swing  widget, back in 2002. David Gilbert, author of JFreeChart, implemented the initial  version of JFreeReport to address report rendering needs. Soon after launching the  project, Thomas Morgner, standing to the right of Will Gorman in the following  picture, became the primary developer. He added critical functionality such as   report functions and XML report definitions, launching JFreeReport into a successful  open source Java project.  Since the beginning, Pentaho Reporting has been an international project. David  is located in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and Thomas is located in Frankfurt,  Germany. Many others from all over the world have contributed translations and  code to Pentaho Reporting.  From 2002 to 2006, Thomas continued to develop JFreeReport into an   enterprise-worthy reporting engine. While working as a consultant, Thomas added  support for a variety of outputs, including Excel and RTF. At the beginning of 2006,  Thomas and JFreeReport joined Pentaho, an open source business intelligence  company, and JFreeReport officially became Pentaho Reporting. At this time,  Thomas transitioned from a full-time consultant to a full-time developer, on the  Pentaho Reporting Engine and suite of tools.   [ 12 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 1  In January 2006, along with the acquisition of Pentaho Reporting, Pentaho  announced the general availability of the Pentaho Report Design Wizard, which  walks business users through a set of simple instructions for building sophisticated  template-based reports. Mike D'Amour, a Senior Engineer at Pentaho, was the initial  author of this wizard, which is now used in many Pentaho applications. Another important milestone in Pentaho Reporting's history was the introduction   of Pentaho Report Designer. In 2006, Martin Schmid contributed the first version   of the Pentaho Report Designer to the community. Since its introduction, the Report  Designer has evolved with the reporting engine. In 2007, Pentaho teamed up with Sun's OpenOffice.org, to deliver a reporting  solution for OpenOffice.org's database tool set. This project was headed by Thomas  Morgner, and is now known as the Pentaho Reporting Flow Engine. While this  engine shares many of the concepts from the classic engine discussed in this book,  it is a separate project with dramatically different features and functionality than  Pentaho's classic reporting project. Beginning in Pentaho Business Intelligence  BI  Platform release 1.6, Pentaho  Reporting also tightly integrates with Pentaho's Metadata Engine, allowing   easy-to-use web-based ad hoc reporting by business users who may not have SQL  expertise, data driven formatting in reports, as well as column and row level data  security. The same functionality is available inside Pentaho Report Designer for query  and report building, allowing business users to go from a quick template-based report  to a full-fledged custom report.  Pentaho Reporting timeline The following is a timeline of the major events in Pentaho Reporting over the past  several years:   	 April 2002: David Gilbert and Thomas Morgner start the JFreeReport project.

Feature overview In this quick introduction to the various features available in Pentaho Reporting 3.5,  you'll have an executive summary of how Pentaho Reporting works and what it can  accomplish for your reporting needs. The topics that will follow are covered in more  depth in later chapters of the book.  An advanced reporting algorithm The reporting algorithm is at the heart of Pentaho Reporting. This algorithm  manages the layout and rendering of the entire report, no matter which output  format is being rendered. This algorithm combines a reporting template, along with  a dataset on the fly, in order to generate the final report. There is no unnecessary  compilation step. All other Pentaho Reporting features can be described in the  context of the overall reporting algorithm.  This algorithm allows reports to render with a page header and footer, a report  header and footer, group headers and footers, as well as a details band. The reporting  algorithm traverses the dataset multiple times to render the report.  In the first pass,  the algorithm performs calculations and determines how to separate the data into  groups, along with calculating the height and width of text and images. After the initial  pass, the algorithm traverses the dataset a second time, in order to render the output.  A multitude of available data sources Pentaho Reporting defines a standard Java API for accessing data. Many data source  implementations are made available with Pentaho Reporting. The most commonly  used implementations include JDBC Database Connectivity, XML XPATH capability,  Multidimensional OLAP Data Access using MDX, and simple Plain Old Java Object   POJO  support.  [ 14 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 1  Additional data sources that are available include a Pentaho Data Integration data  source, a Hibernate Query Language  HQL  data source, and a Pentaho Metadata  data source. With Pentaho's Data Integration data source it is easy to use Excel,   Logs, or other file formats as inputs to a report without the need to write any code.  All of these data sources interact with the reporting engine through a standard API,  which is easy to extend.  The following data sources are available with Pentaho Reporting:  Java Reflection  POJO    	 Swing TableModel  	  	 Hibernate HQL JDBC SQL   	  	 OLAP MDX  	 XML XPATH  	 Pentaho Data Integration  	 Pentaho Metadata  By combining Pentaho Reporting's data source functionality with Pentaho's Data  Integration engine, most known data formats and systems are available for input.  This includes combining data sources into a single report. An example might include  a Microsoft Excel file, on a remote shared drive, with a plain text log file from an  HTTP server.  A wide variety of output formats Pentaho Reporting has the ability to render to the most widely used output  formats, including Adobe's PDF standard using the iText Library, Microsoft's  Excel standard using the POI Library, and HTML, all highlighted in the following  image. Other formats available include XML, plain text, Rich Text Format  RTF ,  and Comma-separated values  CSV . In addition to these output formats, a Pentaho  Report can be rendered in Swing and directly printed using PostScript formatting,  allowing print previewing capabilities.

[ 16 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 1  Pixel accurate rich formatting Reports defined in Pentaho Reporting can specify at the pixel level where objects  such as text or images should render. Using Pentaho Report Designer, it is easy to  align fields and group items that need to stay aligned. While not always possible due  to different format types such as XML, CSV, and plain text, the three main graphical  outputs—HTML, PDF, and Excel—strive to look as similar as possible.  Rich formatting includes TrueType system font selection, the ability to render  geometrical shapes and lines, along with the ability to include images and other  objects in a report. This rich formatting is specified under the covers through styles  similar to Cascading Style Sheets  CSS , separating out the format from the report  detail. This makes it easier to modify and maintain reports, and also to apply  corporate styles through the report wizard.

Many chart types are available, including Bar,  Histogram, Pie, and Line charts.  Report parameterization Pentaho Reporting provides easy-to-use tools to parameterize a report, allowing  users to specify ranges and other values that customize the output of a report.  Parameter values can be selected from a list of hardcoded values or driven from a  query. With parameterization, end users may control the amount of information that  is displayed on a report. The following screenshot is an example of parameter input  from within Pentaho's Business Intelligence Server:  [ 18 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 1  Formulas and style expressions Report builders may define custom formulas and style expressions, using the  OpenFormula standard, allowing for calculated values and dynamic formatting in  their reports, such as aggregations, number formatting, as well as traffic lighting.  Sub-reports Pentaho Reporting allows report developers to include sub-reports within a master  report. This provides a powerful capability, which allows reports to contain different  smaller reports, both side-by-side and within the various bands of a report. These  sub-reports may be based on different data sources.  This capability makes it possible to reuse detailed reports within multiple primary  reports, as well as enabling a single report template to render multiple times in a single  PDF document, allowing painless printing of a large number of reports. The following  screenshot is an example of a report that includes a separate chart sub-report:  [ 19 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   An Introduction to Pentaho Reporting  Cross Tab Reports Cross Tab Reports present data in a spreadsheet-like format, making it easier to  view summaries of data. Cross Tab Reports present both row and column headers,   as well as cells of data, all of which can be customized through report elements.  Interactive reporting While most reports are static after being rendered, a subset of reporting includes  functionality such as drill through, pivoting, and other interactivity. Pentaho  Reporting provides a straightforward Java and JavaScript API for manipulating a  report after it has been rendered, allowing report builders to create very interactive  reports. Pentaho Reporting's Interactive functionality is available when rendering a  report in HTML, Excel or Swing. Links to external documents can also be added to  PDF documents.

Pentaho Report  Designer is a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get  WYSIWYG  report editor that  exposes the rich set of features provided by the Pentaho Reporting Engine. In addition  to building a report from scratch, the Report Design Wizard, included as a part of the  Pentaho Report Designer, walks a report author through building a report, which will  then be displayed in the Report Designer for further customization.  [ 22 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 1  Reporting server As a part of the Pentaho suite, reports created by Pentaho Reporting may be  published, executed, and scheduled on Pentaho's Business Intelligence Server.   The BI Server offers authentication and authorization, as well as a central repository,  to manage your business reports. The BI Server also hosts the web-based Ad Hoc  Reporting user interface for creating Pentaho Metadata-based reports. By combining  the use of Pentaho Report Designer and Pentaho's BI Server, there is no need to write  any code to get your business up and running with Pentaho Reporting.  Java API for building reports Pentaho Reporting comes with a well-documented Java API for building reports  from the ground up, so developers can stick with the Java programming language  when customizing existing report templates or building reports from scratch. This  Java API allows developers to create and modify the various sections of a report,  including the various header, footer, group and detail bands, along with creating   and modifying objects within each section of a report.  Extensibility Pentaho Reporting is designed from the ground up in pure Java, exposing many  interfaces for extension. From implementing basic formulas and functions that   can be embedded in reports, to writing a custom data source or output format,  Pentaho Reporting's source code and API interfaces are well documented and easy   to work with.  A business friendly open source license One very attractive feature of Pentaho Reporting is its license. Pentaho Reporting is  available for free under the GNU Lesser General Public License. This license allows  other open source and proprietary projects to embed Pentaho Reporting without  fear of large license fees or viral open source limitations. As an open source project,  developers also have unprecedented access to the engine and to a large group of  software developers within the Pentaho Reporting community. This community  includes open discussion forums, Internet Relay Chat  IRC  along with commercial  support and licensing, if required.

Please  visit http:  reporting.pentaho.org to learn more about what additional features  and functionality are being considered for development, or to access early release  versions of the product.  Pentaho Reporting architecture The Pentaho Reporting Engine is broken up into eleven main Java projects, which  are then combined to author and render reports. The Pentaho Reporting Engine is  backward compatible to Java 1.2.2, making certain that it stays as lightweight and  as useful as possible. Most of the eleven libraries are independently useful for Java  developers, outside of using them strictly for reporting purposes. The following  diagram describes the various dependencies between each of the reporting projects:  LibSerializer  LibLoader  LibFormat  LibFormula  LibRepository  LibXml  LibFonts  LibDocBundle  Report Engine Core  Report Engine Ext  LibBase LibBase is the root library for all other Pentaho Reporting libraries. This library  contains common capabilities, such as debug and error logging utilities, library  configuration, along with library initialization APIs, for consistent startup and  shutdown management of the reporting engine.  LibBase  [ 24 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 1  LibDocBundle LibDocBundle abstracts the management of Pentaho Reporting file bundles, which  are by default stored as ZIP files, and implements the OpenDocument format   ODF . This makes it simpler for other parts of the reporting engine to work with  and manipulate Pentaho Reporting's file formats.  LibFonts LibFonts allows Pentaho Reporting to work with TrueType system fonts, extracting  the necessary metadata from font types, populating an abstract interface to allow  appropriate rendering in various contexts, including PDF and Excel views.  LibFormat LibFormat is a string formatting library, which can render dates and numbers  appropriately based on format strings. This library is focused on memory and   CPU efficiency for high performance report rendering.    LibFormula LibFormula is a formula parsing and execution library based on the OpenFormula  standard. You can learn more about OpenFormula by visiting http:  wiki.oasis- open.org office About_OpenFormula. This library is similar in function to  Excel-based formula definitions. LibFormula is a very general library, and is used  outside Pentaho Reporting in other projects that require OpenFormula style parsing  and execution.  LibLoader LibLoader manages the loading and caching of all necessary resources required  for generating reports in a generic way, providing a simple API for other parts of   the reporting engine that control static and dynamic content, including data sources   and images.  LibRepository LibRepository abstracts the input and output of hierarchical storage systems, such  as file systems, that Pentaho Reporting interacts with. This makes it possible for a  custom storage system such as FTP, to be implemented and to be mapped to the API,  giving Pentaho Reporting access to the system.

This  is necessary so that the reporting engine can serialize standard Java classes that don't  implement Java's Serializable interface.  LibXml LibXml provides utility classes for SAX  Simple API for XML  parsing and XML  writing, based on Java's JAXP  Java API for XML Parsing  API. This library assures  the speedy loading and validation of Pentaho Reporting XML template files.  Report Engine Core The Report Engine Core project contains the main reporting algorithm for  rendering reports, along with the necessary functionality to support styling.   This project also contains the algorithms for rendering specific outputs, including  PDF, Excel, CSV, XML, and more. The engine relies on the already mentioned   Lib libraries for managing the loading, parsing, formatting, rendering, and archiving  of generated reports.   Report Engine Extensions The Report Engine Extensions project contains third-party extensions to the  reporting engine, which are very useful, but increase dependencies. Extensions  in this project include JavaScript Expression support using the Rhino project, a  Hibernate data source factory, Barcode support using Barbecue, Sparkline support,  along with additional JDK 1.4 support for configuration and printing. Additional  extension projects exist that include charting and many of the data sources discussed  in this book.  When combined, these libraries form the Pentaho Reporting Engine. In addition  to these libraries, there are also other related open source tools and projects in the  Pentaho Reporting landscape, including the Report Engine Demo, Report Design  Wizard, Report Designer, and the web-based Ad Hoc Reporting user interface.

Typical  uses for embedded reporting include operational, business intelligence, financial,  and production reporting.  We've covered the unique history of Pentaho Reporting, from its JFreeReport roots  to its current status as Pentaho Reporting. We've learned about the individuals  who have built Pentaho Reporting from a spare time open source project into an  enterprise level reporting engine, competing with proprietary reporting engines.  We've also learned a great deal about the rich features of Pentaho Reporting. Core  features include a wide variety of data source integration, along with PDF, HTML,  and Excel rendering. On the other hand, more advanced features include sub-reports  and cross tab reports. Additionally, developer-oriented features such as open Java  APIs, along with the available source code and a business-friendly LGPL open  source license gives Pentaho Reporting a leg up on all other Java Reporting toolkits.  The architecture of Pentaho Reporting is also covered in this chapter, providing  developers with a twenty thousand foot view of where they might be able to modify  or contribute to the Pentaho Reporting Engine, along with giving them the ultimate  flexibility of access to source code.  You'll soon be able to apply the rich feature set of Pentaho Reporting to your   use case. In the following chapters, we'll introduce you to Pentaho Reporting's easy  to use Report Designer and Java API, making it fun and easy to embed reporting into  your Java application.

You'll  begin by setting up an environment for building and embedding reports. From  there, you will walk through creating a report. After creating the report, you'll walk  through embedding the report into a Java Swing Client application, and finally you'll  walk through embedding the same report into a Java Enterprise J2EE application.  Along the way you'll receive an introduction on building a report, getting data into  the report, along with generating PDF, Excel, and RTF output documents.    This chapter is written as a tutorial. The best way to learn is to follow the instructions  on your PC while reading. At the end of this chapter, you'll feel comfortable with  the basics of building and embedding a Pentaho Report. Later chapters will assume  that your environment is configured appropriately and that you've retained the  knowledge that you gained in this chapter, so pay attention!  Pentaho Reporting and example   prerequisites Pentaho Reporting and Pentaho Report Designer are written in pure Java,  allowing any operating system that supports the Java Runtime Environment to run  the application. This tutorial requires the use of JDK 5.0 or later. Pentaho Reporting  is a cross-platform application and will run in Linux, Windows, Mac, and other   Java-supported environments. The reporting engine is backward compatible to JDK  1.4, and the core engine component is backward compatible to JDK 1.2.2. The Report  Designer is compatible with JDK 5.0 and above.

To get started, please visit http:  java.sun.com  and download the latest patch  release of the J2SE 6.0 JDK. Verify your install by running java –version on the  command line.  Download the binary distribution of Apache Ant 1.7 from http:  ant.apache.org.   Verify that Ant 1.7 is accessible in your system path by typing ant –version on the  command line.  Finally, download the binary distribution of Apache Tomcat 5.5 from  http:  tomcat.apache.org. To verify that you've installed Tomcat correctly,  start up the server by running bin startup.bat on command line, and verify  that you can access http:  localhost:8080 .   One common issue when running Apache Tomcat is a port  conflict with 8080. You can adjust the default ports Tomcat uses  by modifying the Connector element in conf server.xml.  Setting up Pentaho Reporting To install Pentaho Reporting, your first task is to download Pentaho Report  Designer. Visit http:  reporting.pentaho.org, and follow the link to download  the Report Designer, under the Report Creation Tools section of the webpage.

If you are running on a Macintosh, use  report-designer.app.  At this point, you may want to create a shortcut to your desktop or to your start  menu. Simply right-click on report-designer.exe and select Create Shortcut.  Rename the shortcut to the name of your choice and then drag the shortcut to your  start menu or desktop. You've successfully installed Pentaho Report Designer! Pentaho Report Designer  comes packaged with the core Pentaho Reporting Engine libraries, so you now   have the necessary reporting components to complete the examples in this chapter.  If you've experienced difficulties installing Pentaho Report Designer, there are some  common troubleshooting issues that you will want to verify. The most common issue  is related to the Java Virtual Machine and SDK that you've installed on Windows.  The report-designer.exe uses the first Java command found on the system path.  Therefore, you will want to verify that your path is configured correctly. You can  do this by executing java -version in a command window, in order to see which  version of Java you are using.

This simple report will display the eleven Java libraries  involved in Pentaho Reporting, along with the size of each library. At the bottom   of the report, you'll have a summary that shows the total size of the libraries. Before  you begin, create a directory called chapter2 on your machine, to manage the files  you create in this chapter.  Report Designer introduction When you first start Report Designer, you are taken to a welcome screen. From  this start page, you can create a new report, or browse example reports to help you  learn the various capabilities of Pentaho Reporting. Get started by clicking the New  Report button on the welcome page.  [ 32 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 2  The report canvas, shown in the center of the previous screenshot, is where you  define the look of your report. Note that at this point you haven't decided if the  report will be rendered as PDF, RTF, or Excel. In fact, any report definition can be  rendered in all of those formats. Therefore, at this point, you do not have to worry  about that.  The report canvas contains a set of bands that together make up a report. Bands  include the Report Header and Report Footer, individual Group Header and Group  Footer bands, as well as a Details band that is rendered for each row of data. Reports  may also contain a page header and footer.  To the left of the canvas is a palette where you can choose the various report elements  you would like to include in your report, such as labels, fields, and graphics. You can  drag-and-drop these report elements into the various sections of the report canvas. To the right of the canvas is the Structure tab and Data tab. Below these tabs, the  details of the currently selected structure or data item are displayed. The Master  Report structure tree includes details about every report object displayed on the  report canvas, while the report data tree includes details about the report's data  source information, parameters, and functions.  Below the canvas is an optional messages panel that displays help, warning, and  error messages that help you understand what might be wrong with your report.   An example message might be an undefined field warning.  You can hide any of the panels around the canvas by changing their visibility within  the Window menu. This can help manage your screen while designing reports.  You'll now begin to create a very basic report with the Report Designer.

To keep things simple,  this example will have you enter some example data into a table dataset. Click on the  Data tab on the righthand side of Report Designer. Now, right-click on the Data Sets  tree item and select Table. The following dialog will appear:  Click the add query image button, and then enter the Name as default for the table.  This name will be referenced in your report as the main source of data. Click the  add column image button to add a third column. Double-click and edit the column  headers to be Library Name, Library Description, and Library Size. Double-click  on the Library Size column header table cell and select java.lang.Integer as  the data type for this column. Enter the following data into the table cells, clicking  the add row image button to add additional rows of data. An empty report titled  chapter2_tabledata.prpt is available with this book, in order to avoid the need  to type this data.  Library Name LibBase LibLoader LibSerializer LibRepository LibXml LibFormula LibFonts LibDocBundle LibFormat Report Engine Core Report Engine Extensions Group of common extensions  Library Description Library containing common functions Loading and caching library Java serialization utility library Hierarchical storage library XML utility library Implementation of OpenFormula Font utility library ZIP bundle library String formatting library Base report engine  Library Size 121745 122900 25689 63655 72896 368263 248320 71186 69464 3375047 92335  [ 34 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 2  The library sizes shown here may vary between releases of  Pentaho Reporting, so they might not actually match the  current size of the JAR files.  Once you've entered data in your table, the Table Datasource Editor dialog should  look similar to this:  Now click the OK button. You should see the expanded Data Sets tree with  the three new columns, as shown in the following screenshot:  Report layout With the dataset defined, it's now time to build a very simple report. In this report,  you'll include a report title, column headings, and a details band for the reporting  libraries. You will also include a summary section displaying the total number of  libraries, as well as the sum of their sizes.

Edit the label by either double-clicking directly on it, or  by selecting the value property on the right side in the Attributes tab panel. Enter  Pentaho Report Engine Library Report as the title of the report. Also, adjust the font  and size of this label. Making sure you have the label selected, change the font size in  the top toolbar from 10pt to 16pt. Also, select the bold font option. At this point, you  may need to resize the label to display the entire report title. Move the mouse to the  bottom right of the label and drag the label to accommodate the size of the title.  Creating column headings Below the report title, add three more labels that will represent the column headings  for the details data. The three labels should be Library Name, Library Description,  and Library Size. You may want to enable Snap Guides, which renders a rectangle  around the labels, making it easier to view their alignments. To do this, select the  View  Guides  Snap option in the main menu. Also, add a horizontal-line report element below the labels to distinguish the header  row from the data. You may adjust the line width and color by editing the stroke  and text-color style attributes of the line in the Style tab panel appearing on  the right side of the window.

The example dataset includes eleven libraries, so there   will be eleven individual rows represented by the objects placed in the details band. To place the dataset fields in the details band, select the Data tab, and then  drag-and-drop the Library Name, Library Description, and Library Size fields  into the details band, resizing them appropriately to fit the report.

First, place a line element at the top of the Report Footer band. Also,  place two labels—Library Count: and Total Library Size:—close to the right side  of the report.    It's now time to create the functions necessary to calculate the total number of  libraries and their size. Click on the Data tab and right-click on the Functions item  in the tree. Click the Add Function… menu item. Select the Count  Running   function within the Running functions group and click Add. Name the function  Library Count. Also add a Sum  Running  function, which is located in the Running  functions group. Name the function Total Library Size. Set the Field Name to  Library Size. Finally, drag-and-drop the Library Count and Total Library Size functions into  the Report Footer band. Feel free to adjust the style of these labels and fields.  Previewing and saving your report The Report Designer allows you to preview your report by clicking on the Preview  icon in the toolbar above the canvas. Alternatively, you may preview the report in  various output formats by clicking on the menu File  Preview As. Take a look at  the example report to make sure all fields appear and render appropriately.

Go to File  Save As, and save this report as  chapter2 data chapter2_report.prpt, in order to access it later.  The prpt file generated by the Report Designer is similar to OpenOffice.orgs's  OpenDocument format. This file is a ZIP bundle that includes a main report XML  file, along with other supporting files, including any necessary images, data source  information, sub-reports, and more. If you are interested in viewing the contents of  the file, use your favorite unzip utility and extract the included files.  You've successfully built your first report with Pentaho Reporting!  Now you'll need  a place to execute your report.  For non-developers, Pentaho provides an open source  business intelligence reporting server, discussed in the last chapter of this book. The  next two examples demonstrate embedding your report into a custom Swing and  J2EE application.

This example includes defining a simple Swing  application that will include Pentaho Reporting's Swing preview dialog,  affectionately named PreviewDialog. The example application will simply render  a report. With the help of the PreviewDialog helper widget, you'll be able to save  the report in a variety of formats, along with being able to preview and print right  from the application.  Setting up the Swing example application The first step in building the application is to define a Swing application shell.  This example shell is an extremely simple Swing application that is only a few  lines of Java code. You'll start adding to it once you've got the initial application  defined and once it is successfully compiled. In the chapter2 directory, create two  new subdirectories called src and lib. The src subdirectory will contain the  entire example source, and the lib subdirectory will contain all the necessary JAR  dependencies. Create the file Chapter2SwingApp.java in the src directory with  the following Java code:  import java.awt.*;  import java.awt.event.*;  import javax.swing.*;   public class Chapter2SwingApp extends JFrame {     constructor which displays the simple     application shell  public Chapter2SwingApp   {     super "Chapter 2" ;      exit the JVM when the window is closed  System.exit 0 ;   public void windowClosed WindowEvent e  {    }   this.addWindowStateListener new WindowAdapter   {        } ;     display a preview and exit button in the     main window of the example application.  add new JLabel "Chapter 2 Swing Application"  ;   JPanel buttonPanel = new JPanel  ;  JButton previewButton = new JButton "Preview" ;   [ 40 ]                                                                This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 2  JButton exitButton = new JButton "Exit" ;   buttonPanel.add previewButton ;  buttonPanel.add exitButton ;   add buttonPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH ;  onPreview  ;   public void actionPerformed ActionEvent e  {    }   previewButton.addActionListener new ActionListener   {        } ;    exitButton.addActionListener new ActionListener   {  public void actionPerformed ActionEvent e  {          }  } ;   System.exit 0 ;     The onPreview method is called when the preview    button is pressed  public void onPreview   {      TODO: Load Report and Launch the Preview Dialog      the main method is the entry point into our application  public static void main String args[]  {     TODO: Initialize the Reporting Engine  Chapter2SwingApp app = new Chapter2SwingApp  ;  app.pack  ;  app.setVisible true ;   For now, the code contains two TODO comments where Pentaho Reporting Engine  integration code will go. To compile and run this application, you'll need to define a  simple Ant build.xml file, located in the chapter2 folder. This file includes all the  necessary targets and classpath entries for building the complete Swing application.                                [ 41 ]                                   }      }           }                                                                      }           This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Client and Enterprise Examples                                                                                                    <javac classpathref="classpath" destdir="classes"      fork="true" srcdir="src" >         <java fork="true" classpathref="runtime_classpath"         classname="Chapter2SwingApp" >                         The first Ant build target, clean, clears out the compiled class files from the classes  directory. The second Ant build target, compile, generates the class files and  places them in the classes directory. The final Ant build target, run, executes the  Chapter2SwingApp Java application.  You've now set up the Java application shell and build script. Verify that you can run  the Swing application by typing ant in the chapter2 project directory. You should  see a window appear with a Preview and an Exit Button.

These JAR files are already  a part of the Pentaho Report Designer located in the designer's lib directory. You  simply need to copy them into the chapter2 lib directory. Each JAR file appears  with a version number in the Report Designer. Because the version numbers may vary,  they are not included in this list. Following is the list of the JAR files that you must  copy into chapter2 lib for the examples to compile and run successfully:   	 commons-logging-api.jar  	 itext.jar  	 poi.jar  	 libbase.jar  	 libdocbundle.jar  	 libfonts.jar  	 libformat.jar  	 libformula.jar  	 libloader.jar  	 librepository.jar  	 libserializer.jar  	 libxml.jar  	 pentaho-reporting-engine-classic-core.jar  	 pentaho-reporting-engine-classic-extensions.jar  In addition to the eleven libraries discussed in the first chapter, you must also  include three external libraries. Pentaho Reporting uses Apache Commons Logging  for logging, iText for rendering PDF documents, and POI for rendering Excel  documents. Additional libraries are required when working with charts and other  extensions to the reporting engine.  [ 43 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com                  Pentaho Reporting Client and Enterprise Examples  Now that the JAR files have been copied, you can begin writing the  necessary integration code, embedding Pentaho Reporting into your sample  Chapter2SwingApp.java source file. First, start off by initializing the reporting  engine within the application's main method:  public static void main  String args[]  {     TODO: Initialize the Reporting Engine  ClassicEngineBoot.getInstance  .start  ;  Chapter2SwingApp app = new Chapter2SwingApp  ;  This single line of code allows the Pentaho Reporting Engine to boot up. The boot  up process includes loading system fonts and initializing the engine, based on  configuration properties. In this first example, you do not need to adjust any of the  default initialization behavior of the engine. In future chapters, you'll explore the  startup process in more detail. To compile, you must also add the following import  to the beginning of the file:  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.ClassicEngineBoot;  You are now ready to write the code to render the report using the reporting engine's  Swing PreviewDialog helper widget. There are two steps to this process, loading the  report and launching the preview dialog. First, add the following lines to the preview  button's ActionListener.handleAction   method to load the report definition:  public void handleAction   {     TODO: Load Report and Launch the Preview Dialog  try {                                          MasterReport.class ;       load report definition ResourceManager manager = new ResourceManager  ; manager.registerDefaults  ; Resource res = manager.createDirectly     new URL "file:data chapter2_report.prpt" ,    MasterReport report =  MasterReport  res.getResource  ;     To load the report, use LibLoader's ResourceManager to generate a MasterReport  object. The ResourceManager.createDirectly   API call may throw a  ResourceException, if the resource is not available or fails to load. In addition  to this code, you must also add the following Java imports:  import java.net.URL; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.MasterReport; import org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.resourceloader.Resource; import org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.resourceloader.ResourceManager;  [ 44 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 2  Now that the report is loaded, you can launch the preview dialog:     launch the preview dialog final PreviewDialog preview = new PreviewDialog report ; preview.addWindowListener new WindowAdapter   {       } ; preview.pack  ; preview.setVisible true ;  public void windowClosing  final WindowEvent event  {   }  preview.setVisible false ;  The only parameter provided to the preview dialog is the MasterReport object.  The setVisible true  call renders the dialog on screen.    The following import must also be added:  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.gui.base. PreviewDialog;  To finish the onPreview   method, you need to handle the exceptions thrown  by the three sections you just wrote. The two types of exceptions thrown,  ResourceException, which is thrown when loading the report, and the IOException,  which may be thrown when parsing the URL string, both need to be caught:  e.printStackTrace  ;  } catch  ResourceException e  {   } catch  IOException e  {   }  e.printStackTrace  ;                               }  The following two imports must be added to complete the handleAction   method:  import java.io.IOException; import org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.resourceloader. ResourceException;  In this example application, any thrown exceptions are printed to standard error.  In production applications that you build, you may want to present the error in a  dialog, or handle the exception differently.

In just 19 lines of code and 8 imports,  you've added reporting capabilities to your application!  Run the ant command  again and see the results:  You can now see a preview of the report in your Swing application. From the  preview dialog, you can export the report to the HTML, Excel, PDF, RTF, or CSV  format by clicking on the Export menu. Or you can click the print icon to send the  report directly to the printer. Here are a few example screenshots of rendered   output formats:  [ 46 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 2  Embedding your report in an enterprise  web application To take this example one step further, the following steps demonstrate how to embed  your report into a simple Tomcat J2EE application.  Setting up the example Tomcat application To begin, you must define your Tomcat web application. This includes building a  Web Application Archive  WAR . The first step is to create a few directories in the  existing chapter2 example project. Create the following directories:   	 war  	 war WEB-INF  	 war WEB-INF lib  [ 47 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Client and Enterprise Examples  Once you've defined those directories, you need to define a web.xml file in the  war WEB-INF directory as follows:          This file will eventually include a very basic reporting servlet.  You also need to define an index.html file in the war directory:       Example Application   This is an example application demonstrating how to embed Pentaho  Reporting into your web application.       Now, you need to update the project's Ant build.xml file with additional properties  and a war target. First, add the following property and update the classpath  reference with a pointer to the servlet-api.jar file, necessary for compiling the  servlet class:                             Make sure to replace the example tomcat.home value with the reference to your  Tomcat installation location. Also, add the following war and start_tomcat targets  at the end of the file:    <war basedir="war" destfile="chapter2.war" webxml="war WEB-                                    INF web.xml">                                                     [ 48 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 2                  <exec timeout="1000" dir="${tomcat.home} bin"            executable="${tomcat.home} bin shutdown.bat" >           executable="${tomcat.home} bin startup.bat" >      <exec dir="${tomcat.home} bin"            Now, run the ant war command from the command line. The war target clears out  the existing chapter2 web application and deploys a new project. To restart your  Tomcat server, run ant start_tomcat. Once you've started the server, you should  be able to visit http:  localhost:8080 chapter2  and see the following screen:  Incorporating Pentaho Reporting into the   web application Now that you have a basic web application configured, you can start writing code.  Start off by writing a simple servlet that serves up reports based on user requests.  Begin with the skeleton of an HttpServlet. Place the following code into  Chapter2Servlet.java, located in the project's src directory:  import java.io.IOException;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;  public class Chapter2Servlet extends HttpServlet {            servlet initialization method public void init ServletConfig config  throws   [ 49 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Client and Enterprise Examples  super.init config ;    TODO: Initialize the Reporting Engine       }    the doGet method handles all the requests    received by this servlet public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse   throws ServletException, IOException {       TODO: Handle Pentaho Report Request          }    the doPost method simply calls the doGet method public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse                       ServletException {                                  response                                     response         }    doGet request, response ;       }   throws ServletException, IOException {   Now that you have a baseline HttpServlet to work with, you can start to add the  necessary initialization and service code to generate a report. Add the following code  to the init   method of the Chapter2Servlet class. Notice that this is identical to  the initialization code seen earlier in the Swing example application.  public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {       }  super.init config ;    TODO: Initialize the Reporting Engine ClassicEngineBoot.getInstance  .start  ;  Now, you'll add the necessary code to the doGet   method for serving up PDF files.  The following two steps are similar to the two steps in the Swing client example  code. First, load the report definition from disk:     load report definition ResourceManager manager = new ResourceManager  ; manager.registerDefaults  ; String reportPath = "file:" +       TODO: Handle Pentaho Report Request try {            this.getServletContext  .getRealPath "data chapter2_report.prpt" ;                     MasterReport.class ;    Resource res = manager.createDirectly new URL reportPath ,    MasterReport report =  MasterReport  res.getResource  ;  [ 50 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 2  Notice that the only difference between the Swing example code and the servlet code  is the use of a ServletContext object to locate the report definition. Now that you've  loaded the report, you need to generate and return the PDF to the requesting client:     render the pdf response.setContentType "application pdf" ; PdfReportUtil.createPDF report, response.getOutputStream   ;  This step is the significant difference between the Swing and the servlet example.  In the Swing example, a print preview dialog is rendered. On the other hand, in   the servlet example, a direct call is made into the PdfReportUtil to write the PDF  to the HttpServletResponse object's OutputStream. Notice that before writing  the binary data, the response's content type is set to application pdf. This notifies  the browser that the server is transferring a PDF file to the client.  The final change to the doGet   method is catching any potential exceptions  being thrown:  } catch  ResourceException e  {   }  e.printStackTrace  ;  In writing your enterprise applications, you should handle the exceptions  appropriately.  Now that you've completed the doGet   method, you need to make  sure and include the necessary Java imports:  import java.net.URL; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.MasterReport; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.ClassicEngineBoot; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output. pageable.pdf.PdfReportUtil;  import org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.resourceloader.Resource; import org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.resourceloader. ResourceException; import org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.resourceloader.ResourceManager;  Most of these imports were included in the Swing client example. You've now  successfully built a complete servlet that generates a Pentaho Report in PDF format.  In just a few short lines of code, you can generate a report!

Add the following XML to the web-app parent  element in the web.xml file. This makes sure that the servlet gets initialized and  mapped to the correct URL.

Adding output support for other formats is just as easy. Continue the  example by updating the servlet with Excel and RTF output format options. The first  step will be to detect the requested output format type. Once the report is loaded, the  following code should be placed within the Chapter2Servlet class, replacing the  existing PDF rendering code:     determine the output format and render accordingly String outputFormat = request.getParameter "outputFormat" ;  Based on the request, the servlet will check the parameter and generate output.   First, it will check to see if it should render PDF output from earlier:  if  "pdf".equals outputFormat   {           render in pdf response.setContentType "application pdf" ; PdfReportUtil.createPDF report, response.getOutputStream   ;  Next, it will check to see if it should render Excel output:  } else if  "xls".equals outputFormat   {           render in excel response.setContentType "application vnd.ms-excel" ; ExcelReportUtil.createXLS report, response.getOutputStream   ;  And for any other outputFormat request, the servlet will render the report in  the RTF format:  } else {       }     render in rtf response.setContentType "application rtf" ; RTFReportUtil.createRTF report, response.getOutputStream   ;  While you might think that a report rendered as HTML would be  less complicated than PDF or Excel, in fact, it is more complicated  from a Reporting API perspective. These initial examples do not  include HTML rendering because HTML requires multiple files  to render, such as images and CSS. You'll see an example in the  interactive reporting chapter that demonstrates rendering an  HTML formatted report.

ReportProcessingException; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table. rtf.RTFReportUtil; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table. xls.ExcelReportUtil;  Update the index.html file to include links to the new formats. Replace the anchor  tag added earlier with the following HTML:   Generate PDF Report   Generate Excel Report   Generate RTF Report   After making the necessary modifications, run the Ant start_tomcat target again.   Reload http:  localhost:8080 chapter2. You should see three new links. Verify  that all three formats are rendering as expected. Congratulations! You've built your  first enterprise application that embeds Pentaho Reporting!   Summary In this chapter, you’ve walked all the way through a complete reporting example,  with step-by-step instructions on how to embed Pentaho Reporting into both Java  Swing and J2EE Applications. You started off learning the basics of Pentaho Report  Designer, including building a simple report that displayed details regarding  Pentaho Reporting’s libraries. You then learned the basics of how to include  aggregate report values, such as counts and sums, within the report footer.    After completing the report in Report Designer, you started a new example Java  Swing project from scratch, including the source code and build file.   Finally, you completed the chapter working with Tomcat. You learned how to  deploy a simple, but powerful web application that can serve your Pentaho Reports  not only as a PDF, but also as Excel and RTF documents.  [ 54 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples  in the Real World  In the previous chapter, you learned from scratch about how to get reports to render  in both client and enterprise environments. In this chapter, you'll go one step further  and learn the most commonly used features of Pentaho Reporting through real  world examples.   To get started, you'll first set up a SQL data source that will provide all the data for  the examples. From there, you'll create an "Inventory" report, where you will use  additional functions and embed charts in your report. You'll then create an "End of  the Day Cashier Balance" report, defining report parameters, conditional reporting,  and traffic lighting. Finally, you'll learn how to create an "Invoice" report, creating   an inline sub-report, along with building report bursting capabilities.  When you've completed this chapter, you will have seen a breadth of features that  Pentaho Reporting has to offer, and how they aid report developers in creating  highly useful and attractive looking reports.  Setting up the example data source In most cases, you'll be using Pentaho Reporting with an already existing  dataset—be it CSV, a relational database, or another form of data. To demonstrate  the capabilities of Pentaho Reporting, a reasonably believable data source is included  with this book, which will allow you to learn Pentaho Reporting's capabilities.   This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World  Included is a dataset for a fictional retail company called ElectroBarn that sells  computer and electronics supplies. This dataset includes inventory, purchases,  invoices, and customer relational tables, which are used for the three reporting  examples in this chapter.  The examples that will follow use HSQLDB's file-based embedded database option  to access the JDBC database without the need to start a separate server. HSQLDB is a  lightweight Java database. To learn more about HSQLDB, visit http:  www.hsqldb. org. As long as the hsqldb.jar library is included in your classpath, you will be  able to execute SQL queries. In the examples that will follow, you'll use the HSQLDB  JAR file distributed with Report Designer.  To configure HSQLDB with the ElectroBarn Schema, you need a script that defines  the database tables. The script defines the tables and associates each table with a   CSV file. Create a new directory called chapter3, along with a sub-directory called  data. Within the data directory, create a new text file electrobarn.script with  the following script:     electrobarn.script  CREATE SCHEMA PUBLIC AUTHORIZATION DBA     INVENTORY Table Definition  CREATE TEXT TABLE INVENTORY ITEMNAME VARCHAR,ITEMDESCRIPTION  VARCHAR,ITEMCATEGORY VARCHAR,ITEMID INTEGER,ONHAND INTEGER,ONORDER  INTEGER,SALEPRICE DOUBLE,COST DOUBLE,MANUFACTURER VARCHAR   SET TABLE INVENTORY SOURCE "inventory.csv;ignore_first=true"     PURCHASE Table Definition  [ 56 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  CREATE TEXT TABLE PURCHASES EMPLOYEEID INTEGER,SESSIONID  INTEGER,PAYMENTTYPE VARCHAR,PURCHASETIME TIMESTAMP,PURCHASEID INTEGER  SET TABLE PURCHASES SOURCE "purchases.csv;ignore_first=true"     PURCHASEITEMS Table Definition  CREATE TEXT TABLE PURCHASEITEMS PURCHASEID INTEGER,ITEMID  INTEGER,QUANTITY INTEGER  SET TABLE PURCHASEITEMS SOURCE "purchaseitems.csv;ignore_first=true"     ENDOFDAY Table Definition  CREATE TEXT TABLE ENDOFDAY SESSIONID INTEGER,EMPLOYEEID  INTEGER,ACTUALCHECKTOTAL DOUBLE,ACTUALCASHTOTAL DOUBLE,CHECKOUTTIME  TIMESTAMP  SET TABLE ENDOFDAY SOURCE "endofday.csv;ignore_first=true"     INVOICES Table Definition  CREATE TEXT TABLE INVOICES INVOICEID INTEGER,CUSTOMERID  INTEGER,SALESREP VARCHAR,INVOICEDATE DATE,SHIPDATE DATE,SHIPBY  VARCHAR,SHIPCOST DOUBLE,NOTES VARCHAR  SET TABLE INVOICES SOURCE "invoices.csv;ignore_first=true"     INVOICEITEMS Table Definition  CREATE TEXT TABLE INVOICEITEMS INVOICEID INTEGER,ITEMID  INTEGER,QUANTITY INTEGER  SET TABLE INVOICEITEMS SOURCE "invoiceitems.csv;ignore_first=true"     CUSTOMERS Table Definition  CREATE TEXT TABLE CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERID INTEGER,NAME VARCHAR,CONTACT  VARCHAR,ADDR1 VARCHAR,ADDR2 VARCHAR,CITY VARCHAR,STATE VARCHAR,ZIPCODE  VARCHAR  SET TABLE CUSTOMERS SOURCE "customers.csv;ignore_first=true"  CREATE USER SA PASSWORD "" GRANT DBA TO SA SET WRITE_DELAY 10  Note that each table definition must be defined on a single line. This example uses  HSQLDB's TEXT TABLE to allow the CSV files to act as SQL tables. Each CSV  file contains a row heading, hence the ignore_first=true configuration in  setting the table sources. The CSV files must be in the same directory as the  electrobarn.script file. The seven CSV files, along with the electrobarn.script  file, are provided as a part of this book. You can also download them at   http:  www.packtpub.com files code 3193_Code.zip.

The report  will include information about which products are on hand and on order, along  with a summary pie chart to give an idea of which categories are mostly filling the  inventory. This example will also include a static image in the report header, along  with a page count to round up the report.  Configuring the data source As with the report definition in the previous chapter, you'll start off using the  Pentaho Report Designer and will define your report. Create a new report and start  off by configuring a data source. Click on the Data tab, and right-click the Data Sets  tree item, selecting JDBC as the data source. Within the JDBC Data Source dialog, click the Add Connection button. You'll  see a dialog for entering JDBC information. Set the Connection Name property to  ElectroBarn, and select Hypersonic as the Connection Type. Now, set the Host  Name to file: and the Database Name to the full path to your chapter3\data\ electrobarn.script file, minus the .script file extension. Set the Port Number to  blank. Finally, set the User Name to sa and Password to blank. Click on the Test  button to verify that you can connect to the database. Now click OK to save the  connection information.  [ 58 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  When configuring your Database Connection using the file-based  Hypersonic database, a few common mistakes may occur. These  include forgetting to remove the port number, typing an invalid path,  or selecting the wrong Connection Type. If you are having problems,  make sure your screen is as close to the screenshot previous as possible.  Creating a query Once connected to the ElectroBarn JDBC SQL Database, you need to define a SQL  query to populate the dataset, which the report will display. This example keeps  it simple by selecting the entire contents of the INVENTORY table.  First, click the  add image button next to the Available Queries. This adds a new SQL query named  Query 1, which will be referenced by your report. A report may contain multiple  data sources, and each data source may define multiple queries. Click the edit image  button at the top right of the Query text area, which launches a SQL Editor. You  will first be prompted to select a database schema, from where you will derive your  query. Select the Public option from the drop-down menu and click OK. This will  bring up the SQLeonardo Query Builder.    [ 59 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World  Simply double-click on the INVENTORY table in the bottom left panel. The  INVENTORY database table will appear in the right window, with all columns of the  table selected, and you will see a query tree in the top left panel. Now, in the SQL tree  view on the left, drag the ITEMCATEGORY down to the ORDER BY section of the  query. This sorts the items by category in the result set, which will allow for grouping  inventory by categories within the report. At this time, you may click the Preview  button to view the data in this table.  Finally, click OK. You will see the following SQL  query appear in the Query details section of the JDBC Data Source dialog:  SELECT      "INVENTORY"."ITEMNAME",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMDESCRIPTION",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMCATEGORY",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMID",      "INVENTORY"."ONHAND",      "INVENTORY"."ONORDER",      "INVENTORY"."SALEPRICE",      "INVENTORY"."COST",      "INVENTORY"."MANUFACTURER" FROM      "INVENTORY" ORDER BY      "INVENTORY"."ITEMCATEGORY" ASC   You've now completed configuring your data source and query. Click OK to return  to the main report editor view.  Creating the Report Header and Page Footer Now that you have a defined dataset, it's time to start creating the inventory report.  First add a report title, along with ElectroBarn's logo in the Report Header. Also,  leave room for a pie chart in the report header.  [ 60 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   In addition to adding the labels and the background rectangle, drag-and-drop   an image report element   into the Report Header. This allows you to include  an image in the report. Edit the value attribute of the content element by clicking  the ... button within the Value column. This will bring up a dialog where you  can select the image.    Chapter 3  The dialog allows you to embed the image in the report's prpt file or reference it  externally. Leave the Embed in Report option checked. This way, if you move the  report file in the future, the image will go along with it. Once you've selected the  image, you may adjust its size. First, set the scale style attribute to true, and then  drag the bottom right corner of the image for resizing. You may also want to set the  aspect-ratio style attribute to true. Now that you've configured the Report Header, add a page count to the Page Footer.   This is a two step process. First, you must define a Page Of Pages report function.  You may do this by right-clicking on the Functions tree item within the Data tab  and selecting the Add Function… menu option. From there, select the Page of Pages  function from within the Common category   [ 61 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World  To display the Page of Pages function in your report, drag the function from the  Data tab into the Page Footer.  Defining the Group Header Now that you've defined the report header and page footer, it's time to start adding  report content. First, configure a group with a visible header and footer. This group  will organize the dataset into individual item categories. Right-click on the Groups  tree item in the report Structure tab, and select Edit Group….  Groups in a report are  nested. There is only a single root group in a report. From the group fields dialog,  add ITEMCATEGORY as your grouping field. This informs the report to group all  the inventory items by category.   The SQL result set and defined report groups must match  each other in the ordering of their results, or groups rendered  in the report may repeat themselves and return unexpected  summary results.  Beneath the Groups tree item, you will see two child nodes—Group Header and  Group Footer. Select each node and uncheck the hide-on-canvas attribute. This will  render the group bands in the canvas, allowing you to add report elements to the  bands as required.  [ 62 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  Now that the Group Header and Group Footer bands are visible, start adding some  content to the report. First, drag-and-drop a Category: label into the Group Header,  along with dragging the ITEMCATEGORY field into the header. Behind the text, place  a shaded rectangle to highlight the category header. You can control the Z ordering  or Layering of items in the canvas. After selecting the item to adjust, click Alt-Up or  Alt-Down, in order to move the item either forward or backward, or in or out of the  view. Now, add column headings for all the items you'd like to display in the Details  band, which appears right below the Group Header. Add the following labels: ID,  Name, Cost, On Hand, Total Cost, and On Order.    To help align the column headings vertically and horizontally, you can  add line guides to the report. In the ruler area of the report, click your  mouse and a blue line guide will appear. Labels, text fields, and other  report elements dropped into the report will snap to these line guides,  making it easier to get the report to look just right.  Finally, add a line that horizontally crosses the entire report to add a visual  separation between the group's column headings and the data that follows after it.  Defining the Details band Now, place the necessary text and number fields in the Details band, in order to  display the details of the report. Drag-and-drop all the corresponding fields below  their headers in the Details band.   Cost, On Hand, and On Order are all directly available from the SQL query dataset.   Total Cost is a derived value. Therefore, you will need to define a reporting function  to represent this value in the report. Create a new function of type Common  Open  Formula. Click within the value cell of the Formula property, and then click on the  … within the cell. This will bring the formula editor. Enter the following formula in  order to represent Total Cost:  =[COST]*[ONHAND]  [ 63 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World  Name the function costonhand. Drag-and-drop it into position within the  Details band.  Finally, you may adjust the number formatting of the various fields as necessary. For  financial fields, you can specify $,0.00 to render the dollar amount in a standard  form, and for integer-based numbers such as On Hand, you can specify ,0  without the decimal places. These format strings use Java's DecimalFormat patterns,  discussed in more depth later in the book. You've now configured the Details band  of your report.  Defining the Group Footer and the Report  Footer band To provide summaries of the inventory data, add some roll ups of your detailed  information in the report. Start off by adding On Hand and Total Cost group  totals. First, you need to define two functions of type Running  Sum  Running ,  for both the ONHAND field and the previously defined Open Formula function  costonhand. Once you've added these functions, you then need to drag-and-drop  them into the Group Footer band of the report, formatting the fields accordingly. Now that the Group Footer is complete, add two report summary values—the  entire summation of all items in the inventory and the total cost of inventory. Use  the Running  Sum  Running  function to represent these values. The first function  should use the SQL query value ONHAND to populate the function, and the second  function should use the already defined function costonhand as its input. Place labels along with each of these functions within the Report Footer.  The following is a screenshot of the progress so far in the report, including   the Group Header, Details, Group Footer, and Report Footer bands:  [ 64 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  Adding a pie chart To complete the inventory report, fill the blank space created in the report header with  a pie chart that gives a visual idea of how each item category compares to the others in   into  regards to overall inventory cost. First, drag-and-drop a chart report element  the Report Header. Adjust the size of the chart to fill the area provided. Now, select  the chart and right-click. Select the Chart… menu item. This brings up the Edit Chart  dialog, which has many options for configuring your chart. Select the Pie toggle button in the dialog. The only parameters that need to be  modified in a pie chart are the value-column and value-by-series, which appear  in the Primary DataSource list of parameters. For the value-column, select the  previously defined costonhand function. For the value-by-series property, select  the ITEMCATEGORY field.  Click OK to save your changes. Congratulations! You've now completed building the  report, and can save it for display in your J2EE environment. Select File  Save and  save the report to chapter3\data\inventory.prpt.

Starting off with the  servlet implementation from Chapter 2, you'll make the necessary changes to render  this report, along with some other reports which you will build in this chapter.  Copy the servlet file chapter2\src\Chapter2Servlet.java to chapter3\src\ Chapter3Servlet.java, and rename the class to Chapter3Servlet.  Adding report selection as an input to the servlet The first change necessary to the earlier Chapter 2 example is to add an HTTP  request parameter reportName, which allows you to specify the report to be  rendered. At the beginning of the doGet method, add the following lines of code:  String reportName = request.getParameter "reportName" ; if  reportName == null  {     }  response.getWriter  .println "No report parameter specified" ; return;  Map the reportName parameter to the filename of the report, by modifying the  reportPath variable declaration to the following:  String reportPath = "file:" + this.getServletContext  . getRealPath "data\" + reportName + ".prpt" ;  Now, you'll need to modify the Chapter 3 home page in order to link to   your new report. Copy the contents of the war directory of Chapter 2 into  the chapter3\war directory.  Modify the war index.html file report link  to include the report parameter:   Generate  Inventory PDF Report   Compiling and deploying the report servlet You've now completed the changes necessary to display the inventory report in  your J2EE environment.  It's now time to compile, deploy, and test your new servlet.  Start off by copying the JAR files, located in the lib directory of Chapter 2, into the  chapter3\lib directory. Finally, copy the build.xml file, located in the chapter2  directory, into the chapter3 directory.  [ 66 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  You'll need to make a few minor changes to the build environment to complete  the job. First, you'll need to rename your servlet reference in your web.xml to  Chapter3Servlet. Second, you'll need to place the hsqldb.jar file, included in the  lib\jdbc directory of Pentaho Report Designer, in your chapter3\lib directory.  Finally, you'll need to add the following charting JARs to your lib directory as well,  all of which are located in Pentaho Report Designer's lib directory:   	 jfreechart.jar  	 jcommon.jar  	 pentaho-reporting-engine-legacy-charts.jar  The jfreechart and jcommon JAR files are needed for basic JFreeChart capabilities,  and the pentaho-reporting-engine-legacy-charts JAR contains the necessary  Pentaho Reporting API code that allows rendering of JFreeChart within a report.   Finally, you'll need to update the Ant build.xml file's war target to deploy a  chapter3.war file instead of the chapter2.war file. Once those changes have  been made, execute ant start_tomcat, which will compile and deploy the new  chapter3.war file to your tomcat server, along with restarting the server. Visit  http:  localhost:8080 chapter3 . After clicking on the Inventory Report link,  you should see a PDF similar to the following:  [ 67 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World  The ElectroBarn Inventory example highlights a lot of the basic functionality available  to report builders, including simple formulas and functions, as well as static images  and charts based on report data. This report also demonstrates connecting to a JDBC  data source. In future chapters, you'll learn about the APIs necessary to manage JDBC  connections within the servlet environment. In this example, the reporting engine  managed the creation and closing of the HSQLDB file-based connection.  There is a common issue associated when using HSQLDB   file-based connections. It occurs when multiple processes  attempt to connect to the file. If your report fails to render  in your J2EE environment, make sure no other process is  actively accessing the HSQLDB data source.  End of the day cashier balances To continue with the ElectroBarn example, you'll now create an "End of the Day  Cashier Balance" report. This report highlights additional functionality of the  Pentaho Reporting Engine, including report parameters, commonly used functions,  traffic lighting, sub-groups, as well as more advanced formula usage.  This report will display a brief summary of the day's activities for a cashier, along  with a detailed list of all the cashier's sales on a given day. A cash register variance  will be calculated. If it is less than a certain minimum amount, it will change color   to alert managers that there may be an issue.  As in previous examples, you'll first build the report using Report Designer, and   then update the Chapter3Servlet class with the necessary changes to render your  report in your J2EE environment. Begin by creating a new report in the Pentaho   Report Designer.  Configuring an input parameter For this example, you'll define a Session ID input parameter, which will limit the  results of the report to a specific end of day session. To start off the example, create a  new report and right-click on the Parameters tree item in the Data tab, selecting the  Add Parameter… menu option. This brings up the Add Parameter dialog. Click the  add image button next to DataSources and select JDBC. This brings up the JDBC  Data Source dialog demonstrated earlier. Select the already defined ElectroBarn  connection and define a SQL query named Sessions that selects distinct SESSIONID  column results from the ENDOFDAY table.  [ 68 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  SELECT DISTINCT      "ENDOFDAY"."SESSIONID" FROM      "ENDOFDAY" ORDER BY      "ENDOFDAY"."SESSIONID" ASC  This query will be used to populate a parameter drop down when rendering the  report. Once you've defined the query, set the parameter Name to SessionInput, the  Label to Select Session:, and the Type to Drop Down. Also, set the Value Type to  java.lang.Integer. The dialog should look something like the following screenshot:  Now, click the preview button of the empty report. You'll see a parameter section  appear above the rendered report, with a drop down to select the current session:  Selecting a session and clicking Update will refresh the report with the parameter  value. The Autoupdate on selection checkbox may be selected to force an update  every time you change the parameter value.

Launch the JDBC Data Source dialog from the Data tab.  You've already configured the ElectroBarn JDBC connection, so simply select that  option in the Connections list. Add a query and launch the query designer, making  sure to select the Public schema. The SQL query that will drive the balance report will involve multiple tables. First,  double-click on the ENDOFDAY table, in order to add it to your SQL Query. The  ENDOFDAY table contains summary information such as Actual Cash and Actual  Check Total. Next, double-click on the PURCHASES and PURCHASEITEMS tables. These  tables together define individual purchases made throughout the day, and will be  used to calculate total sales, along with displaying the individual sales. Finally,  double-click on the INVENTORY table, which contains details about an item, including  its name and price.  Now that you've added all the necessary tables, you'll need to reduce the number of  selections because you won't be using all of the columns in all of the selected tables  in the report. For instance, you need only the ITEMNAME and SALEPRICE columns in  your INVENTORY table.  You also need to define the relationships between these tables. Within the visual  table views, drag-and-drop the ENDOFDAY.EMPLOYEEID column over to the  PURCHASES.EMPLOYEEID column, along with the ENDOFDAY.SESSIONID column  over to the PURCHASES.SESSIONID column. This sets up an inner join one-to-many  relationship between the ENDOFDAY and PURCHASES tables. Now, drag-and-drop the  PURCHASES.PURCHASEID column over to the PURCHASEITEMS.PURCHASEID column.  This sets up a one-to-many relationship between a purchase and its items. Again,  drag-and-drop the PURCHASEITEMS.ITEMID column over to the INVENTORY.ITEMID  column. You've now set up the relationships between these tables. As the next step, right-click on the WHERE clause and click add condition…. Enter  "ENDOFDAY"."SESSIONID" in the first text area, and ${SessionInput} in the  second text area, leaving the = operator selected. This embeds the SessionInput  parameter, which was defined earlier, into the SQL query.  Finally, you need to specify the correct ORDER BY columns, so the report groups  correctly.  First, right-click on the ENDOFDAY.SESSIONID column in the tree view and  add it to the ORDER BY clause. Now, right-click on the PURCHASEID and add it also to  the ORDER BY clause.

Creating the Report Header and Page Footer In this example, you'll create a very simple report header and page footer, with the  same Page of Pages function that was used in the Inventory example. Include a title  and the ElectroBarn's logo for good measure.

You'll start by defining an Open Formula function  titled TotalItemPrice. First, right-click on the Functions tree item within the Data  tab and select the Add Function… menu option. Select Common  Open Formula  and click the Add button. In the formula editor, enter the following formula:  =[QUANTITY] * [SALEPRICE]  Now drag-and-drop the ITEMNAME, QUANTITY, SALEPRICE, and  TotalItemPrice into the Details band as pictured below:  For the SALEPRICE and TotalItemPrice fields, select the menu item Format   Morph  number-field, and adjust their format attributes to match $,0.00.  Defining the Group bands In this example, there are two levels of groupings. The top level group should use  SESSIONID as its only group field. Right-click on the Groups tree item, click Edit…,  and add SESSIONID to the selected items list. Give the name sessionid to the first  group. To add the second level sub-group, right-click on the first group and click the  Add Group menu option. This second group should use PURCHASEID as its only  group field. You'll be placing group detail in both group headers and the sub-group  footer. Therefore, enable visibility for those three tree items by de-selecting the hide- on-canvas attribute for each band. You'll start off by defining the sub-group header of the report. This sub-group  contains Individual Sales information such as payment type. Create labels for  the Purchase ID, Employee ID, Payment Type, and Purchase Time fields,  along with dragging and dropping those fields on the report layout. Morph the  PURCHASETIME field into a date-field, and set the date format to MM-dd-yyyy  hh:mm a. Note that Pentaho Reporting uses Java's SimpleDateFormat  http:  java. sun.com javase 6 docs api java text SimpleDateFormat.html .  Below the summary section, display column headers for the already defined Details  band, including italicized labels for Purchased Items, Quantity, Sale Price, and  Total. Also, add a line below the header columns to clearly separate them from the  Details band. Your sub-group header band should look something like the following  when complete:  [ 72 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  Now, it's time to begin work on the sub-group footer band. In this section, you're  going to display a Purchase Total: label, along with the Purchase Total. You'll  need to define a Summary  Sum function with TotalItemPrice as its field and  purchaseid as its group. Name this function PurchaseTotal. To complete the  sub-group footer band, drag-and-drop the PurchaseTotal, morphing the report  element to a number-field and applying the appropriate format string. Also, add   a line to separate the sub-group footer from the Details band.  Defining the main Group Header Now that you've defined the low level reporting details, you are ready to present a  summary of the day's activities in the form of the main Group Header. Before you  begin the layout of this band, first define the necessary functions, which you need   for populating your summary results. You'll want to display separate summaries   of each payment type. In order to do so, you'll need to define formulas and functions  to calculate these values. To calculate Total Check Sales, you'll need to define an Open Formula function  titled CheckTotalItemPrice. This Open Formula function will need to determine  if the item is part of a check purchase. And if it is indeed a part of a check purchase,  display its value, otherwise display zero. Here is the formula necessary:  =IF [PAYMENTTYPE]="check";[TotalItemPrice];0   Notice the use of the IF   function as part of the formula. The first parameter of the  IF function evaluates to either true or false. The second parameter, TotalItemPrice,  is returned if PAYMENTTYPE is a check. Finally, the third parameter, 0, is returned if  PAYMENTTYPE is anything but a check.  [ 73 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World  Now that you've defined a row level expression, you also need to sum these values  to get a global group sum for Total Checks. To accomplish this, define a Summary   Sum function titled ExpectedCheckTotal, with the group set to the sessionid  group and the field set to the recently created CheckTotalItemPrice.  You must do this for the other payment options as well, including Cash, Credit,  and Debit. The following table shows the Open Formula and Sum functions, which  should be defined:  Function type Open Formula  Function name CashTotalItemPrice  ExpectedCashTotal  Open Formula  CreditTotalItemPrice  ExpectedCreditTotal  Open Formula  DebitTotalItemPrice  Sum  Sum  Sum  ExpectedDebitTotal  Function parameters  formula  =IF [PAYMENTTYPE]  = "cash";  [TotalItemPrice]; 0  Group: sessionid, Field:  CashTotalItemPrice =IF [PAYMENTTYPE]  = "credit";  [TotalItemPrice]; 0  Group: sessionid, Field:  CreditTotalItemPrice =IF [PAYMENTTYPE]  = "debit";  [TotalItemPrice]; 0  Group: sessionid, Field:  DebitTotalItemPrice  You also need to define a Sum for the entire total, by using TotalItemPrice as the  field and sessionid as the group. Name this function ExpectedTotalItemPrice. For the last function, you must define an additional Open Formula function that  calculates the ActualTotal.  =[ExpectedCreditTotal] + [ExpectedDebitTotal] + [ACTUALCHECKTOTAL] +  [ACTUALCASHTOTAL]  The cashier is accountable for checks and cash. However, the credit card transactions  are automated, so there is no need to calculate a potential variance with those  purchases. You're now ready to lay out the Group Header band. To begin, add a heading label titled End of Day Summary: with a colored rectangle  in the background, in order to highlight its importance. Below that, add an  Employee ID label, along with the EMPLOYEEID field. Also, add a Date: label and  the CHECKOUTTIME field, morphing the time to a formatted date-field. You may  want to also include the SESSIONID field.  [ 74 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  Below that section, add a column of labels for expected totals, including Credit  Sales:, Debit Sales:, Check Sales:, Cash Sales:, and Expected Total:. Next to each of  those labels, add the appropriate data fields, using the functions defined above. Now, add another label column for actual values, including labels for Credit  Actual:, Debit Actual:, Check Actual:, Cash Actual:, and Actual Total:. Next to  each of those labels, add the appropriate fields. For the Credit, Debit, and Actual  Total fields, reuse the expected values. For Check and Cash, use the database fields  ACTUALCHECKTOTAL and ACTUALCASHTOTAL.   You're almost done! To spice things up a bit, you may traffic light the ActualTotal  report element based on variance. The term traffic lighting refers to dynamically  changing the background color of a report element to highlight a range of values  such as the color green to highlight a value within a certain variance, and red for  values outside a variance. Select the ActualTotal report element in the report, and  set the bg-color style formula to the following:  =IF ABS [ActualTotal]-[ExpectedTotal]  < 5.00;"00FF00";  IF ABS [ActualTotal]-[ExpectedTotal]  < 10;"FFFF00";"FF0000"   This formula sets the background color of the report element to either green,  yellow, or red, depending on the variance calculation of ABS  [ActualTotal]- [ExpectedTotal] . If the value is within $5, everything is well and good. If it is  within $10, change the background to yellow. And for the value of variance above  $10, the cashier is in a world of hurt, so display red as the background color. As a final step, add the variance value. First, add a label titled Variance, beneath   next to it. Instead  the Expected Total. Now, add a number field report element  of relying on an existing function or data field, use the value formula property of  the number field to calculate the variance. All styles and attributes may use inline  formulas to determine their values by clicking in the formula cell of the property.  Enter the following formula:  =[ActualTotal]-[ExpectedTotal]  [ 75 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World  You've now completed the main Group Header band. The band should look  something like the following screenshot:  Congratulations! You're now ready to view this report in your J2EE environment.  Save the report as endofday.prpt in the chapter3\data directory.   Incorporating the End of Day report into your  J2EE environment You've already set up the framework for incorporating the Chapter 3 examples   into your J2EE environment. Now, all you need to do is make a minor update to   the servlet, passing in the sessionId parameter to the report. First, get the  sessionId from the HTTP request. Add the following code right after retrieving  the reportName in the doGet   method:  String sessionId = request.getParameter "sessionId" ;   Now you need to provide the MasterReport object with the input parameter.  Add the following code right after creating the MasterReport object:  report.getParameterValues  .put "SessionInput",   if  sessionId != null  {                                  new Integer sessionId  ; }  By placing the sessionId in the MasterReport object's parameter value map, the  report has access to the parameter for execution of the SQL query. Under the covers,  the report engine will use a java.sql.PreparedStatement to populate the SQL  parameter and execute the query.

The final result should look  something like this:  In this example, you learned how to incorporate reporting formulas and functions,  along with using style expressions and multilevel groupings, in order to organize  your data. You also learned how to define and use report parameters.  ElectroBarn invoice example It's often the case that a small-or medium-sized business will want to customize their  invoices and use a reporting engine to generate standard templates for use. In this  example, you'll learn how to build a bursting invoice report, along with learning  about additional capabilities of Pentaho Reporting, including sub-reports and  external URL linking.  As in previous examples, you'll first build the report using the Pentaho Report  Designer, and then update your J2EE environment with the necessary changes   to render the invoice report.  [ 78 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 3  Configuring the data source query To start, launch the JDBC Data Source dialog. You've already configured the  ElectroBarn JDBC data source, so simply select that option in the Connection list.  Now, define a query and launch the query designer, making sure to select the   Public schema. This query will involve multiple tables. First, double-click the INVOICES table, in  order to add it to your SQL Query.  The INVOICES table contains general invoice  information, such as the customer ID and shipping information. Next, double-click  the INVOICEITEMS and INVENTORY tables. These tables define the individual invoice  items purchased, and will be used to calculate the total invoice price, along with  displaying the individual purchased items.  You now need to define the relationships between the tables. Within the visual   table views, drag-and-drop the INVOICES.INVOICEID column over to the  INVOICEITEMS.INVOICEID column. This sets up an inner join one-to-many  relationship between the INVOICES and INVOICEITEMS tables. Now, drag-and-drop  the INVOICEITEMS.ITEMID column over to the INVENTORY.ITEMID column. You've  now set up the relationships between these tables.  Finally, you need to specify the correct ORDER BY columns. First, right-click on the  INVOICE.INVOICEID column in the tree view and add it to the ORDER BY clause,  followed by the INVOICEITEMS.ITEMID column being added to the ORDER BY clause. You should now have the following query defined for the report:  SELECT      "INVOICES"."INVOICEID",      "INVOICES"."CUSTOMERID",      "INVOICES"."SALESREP",      "INVOICES"."INVOICEDATE",      "INVOICES"."SHIPDATE",      "INVOICES"."SHIPBY",      "INVOICES"."SHIPCOST",      "INVOICES"."NOTES",      "INVOICEITEMS"."ITEMID",      "INVOICEITEMS"."QUANTITY",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMNAME",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMDESCRIPTION",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMCATEGORY",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMID",      "INVENTORY"."ONHAND",      "INVENTORY"."ONORDER",      "INVENTORY"."SALEPRICE",  [ 79 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World       "INVENTORY"."COST",      "INVENTORY"."MANUFACTURER" FROM      "INVENTORY" INNER JOIN "INVOICEITEMS" ON "INVENTORY"."ITEMID"         = "INVOICEITEMS"."ITEMID"      INNER JOIN "INVOICES" ON "INVOICEITEMS"."INVOICEID"        = "INVOICES"."INVOICEID" ORDER BY      "INVOICES"."INVOICEID" ASC,      "INVOICEITEMS"."ITEMID" ASC  Defining the Group Header In this report, you'll define a single group. The root group should include the  grouping field INVOICEID. For the group header and footer, uncheck the  hide-on-canvas attributes.    Now, you're ready to begin populating the group header. Note that because you'll  want the ability to burst multiple invoice reports, you'll place no header information  in the report header. Instead, you'll place this information in the group header.  Include the company's logo as in previous examples, along with displaying company  details such as the address, by including labels.  Below the company details, add a label that will render as a hyperlink in the PDF.  First, define a basic label with the URL http:  www.ElectroBarn.com. Then edit  the url style attribute of the label with the same URL. Defining the url style attribute  lets the reporting engine’s report layout renderer know to create a hyperlink over the  defined report element. On the right side of the invoice, include labels and fields to display the INVOICEID,  INVOICEDATE, and SALESREP of the invoice, along with a large label clearly  marking this report as an invoice. Now, add a sub-report element to the group header, selecting the Inline option. An  inline sub-report allows side-by-side sub-reporting, whereas a banded sub-report  acts as an additional report band and can have a dynamic height. Size the sub-report  to fill half the screen.  At the bottom of the group header, you'll add the column headings including  Invoice Items, Quantity, Sale Price, and Total. Also, add a colorful rectangular  background to the header row, in order to distinguish it from the invoice data.

Right-click on the  sub-report element in the canvas and select Edit SubReport. This opens a new canvas  tab, where you can edit the sub-report. Bring up the Sub-report Parameters dialog by  right-clicking and editing the Parameters tree item in the Data tab of the sub-report.

Once you've configured the CUSTOMERID as an input, configure the sub-report's  SQL query. Right-click on the Data Sets tree item in the Data tab, and select the  JDBC menu option. Add a data source query with the name customerdetails.  This query should include all the columns of the CUSTOMERS table.  In addition  to adding the table, right-click on the WHERE clause and add a condition where  "CUSTOMERS"."CUSTOMERID" = ${CUSTOMERID}. This limits the results of the  sub-query to the current customer. Your query result should look like this:  SELECT      "CUSTOMERS"."CUSTOMERID",      "CUSTOMERS"."NAME",      "CUSTOMERS"."CONTACT",      "CUSTOMERS"."ADDR1",      "CUSTOMERS"."ADDR2",      "CUSTOMERS"."CITY",      "CUSTOMERS"."STATE",      "CUSTOMERS"."ZIPCODE" FROM      "CUSTOMERS" WHERE      "CUSTOMERS"."CUSTOMERID"=${CUSTOMERID}  You're now ready to populate the sub-report. In this example, place a rectangle with  a black border in the sub-report Details band, along with a Customer: label and the  appropriate fields to display the customer details. To add the Attn: in front of the  CONTACT field, morph the field into a message-field, and edit the value to equal  Attn: $ CONTACT .  For the CITY, STATE and ZIPCODE fields, morph the CITY field  and edit the value to equal $ CITY , $ STATE  $ ZIPCODE .  You've now created your first sub-report!  This sub-report will be bundled as part of  the .prpt file when saving the main report.

It should also contain a report function of the type  Open Formula titled TotalItemPrice, with the formula:  =[QUANTITY] * [SALEPRICE]  In addition to the data fields, you'll also include a rectangular background that  fills the entire height of the Details band. You'll do some row banding with this  rectangle, so make sure to give it a name such as detailsRect.  Now, set the visible style formula of the rectangle to the following:  =IF ISEVEN ROWCOUNT   ; TRUE  ; FALSE     For every other row, the rectangle will hide itself, allowing the rows of your   invoice items to be clearly banded together.  Defining the Group Footer and Page Footer To complete the invoice report, you'll need to populate the Group Footer with the  necessary summary values, along with a notes section for the invoice. Define a new  report function of type Sum that sums the TotalItemPrice expression, in order to  calculate the PurchaseTotal. Also, define a formula-based number field called  TaxTotal with the following formula:  =[PurchaseTotal]*0.06  Use a 6% sales tax in the example. For a grand total number field, define the  following formula that sums all of the costs:  =[PurchaseTotal] * 1.06 + [SHIPCOST]  [ 83 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Pentaho Reporting Examples in the Real World  In addition to displaying the summarized invoice costs, also add the NOTES field  to your report. Text fields have the ability to wrap multiple lines, if necessary.   Resize the field to fill in the left portion of the Group Footer as shown in the  following screenshot:  As a final touch to the Group Footer, add a friendly message such as Thank you  for shopping at ElectroBarn!, which will encourage your customers to continue  shopping at ElectroBarn. The very last step in completing the report is to add a page  count in the Page Footer band, as well as to force page breaks after each Group  Footer. To make this report burstable, you'll want to reset the page counter at the  end of every invoice and begin each invoice at the top of a page. You can do this by  selecting the pagebreak-after style property in the group footer, which forces a new  page below the group footer. Also, you need to set the group property of the Page  Of Pages Function to the invoice group.  You've now completed the design of the  report. Save the report as chapter3\data\invoices.prpt.   Incorporating the invoice report into your  J2EE environment You're now ready to update your J2EE environment, in order to render the invoices  report. There are no changes required to the servlet, but you will need to update the  home page of the web application. Add a link to the report, in the HTML of your  chapter3 home page, index.html.

Type the ant restart_tomcat command to build the new war.  Visit http:  localhost:8080 chapter3 and click the Burst Report link.  The final result should look something like this:  Chapter 3  This report could be sent directly to a printer to generate all the invoices for a day.  Or you could parameterize the report down to an individual invoice, allowing  customers to access their invoices online. Another option for bursting might include  generating individual PDFs per invoice, and either mailing them out or sending  them to another system to process.  In this example, you learned how to add a sub-report to a main report, along with  learning additional functions and styles, including row banding, URL display, and  page breaking.

In the first example, you learned how  to work with SQL data sources, define charts, and how to use formulas and functions  in an inventory report. In the second example, you defined a parameterized cashier  balance report with dynamically driven styles, including adding traffic lighting to  the report. In the third example, you incorporated inline sub-reports into an invoice  report, along with adding hyperlinks and row banding to the report. You embedded  these reports in a J2EE environment, which involved adding JAR dependencies for  charting and updating your servlet to support parameterization.  Now that you've experienced Pentaho Reporting in the real world, it's time to dive  deeper into each subject area, allowing you to gain the expertise to build advanced  reports with Pentaho Reporting.

To add an element to your report,  drag-and-drop an element from the palette into the report canvas.  Chapter 4  Report canvas tab panel The report canvas tab panel is located in the center of the Report Designer.   Once you've created a new report or opened an existing one, this is where you   drag-and-drop report elements to build your report. In design mode, the canvas  displays the currently visible report bands. The canvas offers many visual features  that allow you to manage the alignment and sizing of your report elements.  In addition to the design canvas, you can also preview the current report. You   can quickly toggle between live data and the report template in this fashion.   Report Explorer The Report Explorer, located on the right side of the Report Designer, includes  a Structure tab panel. The Structure tab panel contains the tree structure of a  report, including all the report bands. The Data tab panel contains all the data  sources, functions, and parameters of a report. Right-clicking on various portions   of the structure and data trees presents options such as adding new data sources   and sub-groups. The Report Explorer may be hidden through the Window  application menu.  Element Properties The Element Properties panel is located below the report explorer panel, on the right  side of the Report Designer, and displays the details of the currently selected item in  the report explorer or canvas. All styles and attributes, which are editable, appear in  this panel. Many editable properties provide additional dialogs for advanced editing  capabilities.

Selecting a message will  automatically select the element and property in question, making it easy to track  down issues in your report. The Message panel is hidden by default, and can be  made viewable through the Window application menu.  Report bands When first creating a report in your canvas and report explorer structure tree, you  will see a Page Header, Report Header, Details band, Report Footer, and a Page  Footer band appear as part of the report. These bands, along with other bands,  including Group, Watermark, and No Data bands that you may define, make up  the entire visual report. All bands may contain elements from the palette, and act as  containers for rendering these elements. Each band has a different life cycle, and is  rendered based on their context. In this section, you'll go over each band's properties,  along with the context in which each band renders itself.  Common properties All bands share a common set of properties, which are explained using tables in the  forthcoming sub-sections. Certain properties may offer a dialog for editing, which is  displayed in the list as well.  Size and position properties These properties define the size and position for the band. These properties may be  edited together by selecting the band in the structure tree and then clicking on the  Format  Size & Border… menu item, or individually within the Report Element  Styles tab.

To enable the grid, enable the menu  item View  Grids  Show. The grid presents itself in point units  also known as  pixel units , with a light gray grid line displayed every five pixels, along with a  darker shade guide line presented every 25 pixels.   Grid lines are useful for visual feedback of alignment, as well as providing a method  to snap elements to the grid. This makes aligning of elements a simple exercise.  To adjust the ruler unit to centimeters, millimeters, inches, or picas, go to the View   Units sub-menu. The default grid size may be adjusted from five pixels to another  number by launching the grid size dialog. Select the View  Grids  Settings  menu item and adjust your grid sizing. Note that the darker shade major guide line  appears between every five regular grid lines. You may show or hide the grid by selecting the menu item View  Grids  Show,  or by pressing Ctrl+Quote.  Guide lines Guide lines allow you to specify a custom grid line. To add a new horizontal or  vertical guide line, click within the ruler section of the report canvas. A new blue  guide line should appear. Guide lines are useful for visual feedback of layout, as   well as snap to grid features that simplify element placement.  Guide lines may be moved by dragging their location within the ruler. They may also  be moved by right-clicking on the line within the ruler and selecting Properties...,  and then typing in the new value for the guide line.  [ 108 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 4  It is possible to deactivate a single guide line by right-clicking and selecting Deactivate.  This causes the guide line to be removed from the report canvas content, and appear  as a greyed out mark within the ruler section of the canvas. Also, guide lines may be  completely removed from the report by right-clicking and selecting Delete. All guide lines may be activated and deactivated together by selecting View   Guides  Show Rulers, or by clicking Ctrl+Semicolon. This is useful if you use many  guidelines and want to quickly see the report without all the blue lines running  through it.  Additional visual indicators In addition to grid lines and grid guides, a couple of other handy shortcuts exist to  make it easier to lay out your report. By default, when selecting a report element,  the style of the selection is considered an Outline Selection. An alternative selection  style is Clamp Selection. You may toggle between these two types of selections by  selecting View  Outline Selection or View  Clamp Selection.  Also, it is possible to show and hide all element frames by selecting View  Guides   Toggle Element Frames, or by clicking Ctrl+H. This is another tool to make it easy  to visualize how the elements will be laid out next to each other, and to see potential  overlaps that might cause problems when rendering the report.  [ 109 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Design and Layout in Pentaho’s Report Designer  Another visual indicator within Report Designer is the View  Show Overlapping  Elements menu option. With this option selected, any overlapping elements are  highlighted, warning that there may be problems when rendering the report.  Finally, another useful capability within the Report Designer is the ability to zoom  in and out of the grid. By default, the Report Designer displays the grid rendered at  100%. Within the View  Zoom menu, you may view the report as 50%, 100%, 200%,  or 400% of its actual size. By default, the Report Designer displays the grid rendered at 100%. Within the View   Zoom menu, you may view the report as 50%, 100%, 200%, or 400% of its actual size.  You may also zoom in by holding your mouse down in the left corner of the report  canvas over the current zoom level and dragging left and right to adjust the zoom.  Moving and aligning single elements In addition to dragging and dropping elements around the report canvas, it is   also possible to use shortcut keys and menu items to more easily align and move  report elements.  To move an element, first select the element and then drag-and-drop it to the new  location within a band. You may also use the arrow keys to move the selected  element by individual pixels.  To control the visibility of an element in context of other elements that may overlap,  select the element, and then select the Format  Arrange  Bring Forward or Format   Arrange  Bring Backward option to adjust the order in which elements appear  within a band. This is also known as Z ordering.  Aligning groups of elements To really sharpen a report, there are two easy-to-use shortcuts available for aligning  groups of elements. First, select the elements as a group by holding the Shift key and  dragging a selection area around the elements, or by holding the Shift key down  while selecting individual elements.  [ 110 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 4  Once you've selected a group of elements, you can easily align all the elements  in a group both horizontally or vertically. If you want to align all the labels in the  example to the top, select the menu item Format  Align  Top. This will align all  the selected elements to the topmost selection in the group. Additionally, you may  align these elements in the Middle or Bottom. For elements grouped vertically, you  can align them Left, Center, or Right.  Now, assume that you want to evenly distribute all the elements that are selected.  This is possible by selecting the menu item Edit  Distribute  Equal Horizontal  Space. You can do the same vertically by selecting Equal Vertical Space.  Miscellaneous layout capabilities There are also some additional layout features that make your life easier when  working within the Report Designer. The first feature is the ability to Paste  Formatting of an element into another element. Select and copy the element you  would like to use to share formatting with. Now, select the additional elements  you would like to apply the formatting to and select the menu item Edit  Paste  Formatting. All the formatting-related attributes are copied into the selected  elements, preserving their data-related properties.

Some additional functionality exists in libfonts, providing the report engine  with additional information that is not available through Java’s standard Font and  FontMetrics API.  In Pentaho Report Designer, fonts may be modified in multiple ways. First, all   text-based elements contain font properties. These properties allow the selection of  the Font-Family, Font-Size, and Font-Style. When editing these properties through  the menu Format  Font…, the following screen is presented:  In addition to modifying the property, Pentaho Report Designer also provides a  toolbar  shown in the following screen , where you can quickly modify the font  name, size, and style.  [ 113 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Design and Layout in Pentaho’s Report Designer  Another way to configure fonts is using the property Styles. The following styles  are available in relation to fonts:  Property name family bold  embed  encoding  italics font-size smooth  strike through  Description A string that represents the font type, for instance “Arial”. If set to true, display the font in bold. For example, if the  formula is set to “=TRUE  ”, the font will appear as bold. If this style equals true, embed the fonts included in the report,  while rendering PDF. A string that represents the character encoding of the font used  in PDF output. If set to true, display the font in italic. A number that represents the point size of the font. If set to auto, fonts above 8 pts have anti-aliasing enabled. If set  to always, all fonts have anti-aliasing enabled. Finally, if set to  never, no fonts have anti-aliasing enabled. If set to true, display the font with a strikethrough.  Additional font-related issues may arise if a report is designed in one operating  system environment and published in other. For instance, Windows XP and  Windows Vista come with a different standard set of fonts than Solaris, Mac, and  Linux systems. Pentaho Reporting does its best to match the correct font, but you  should verify after publishing that font sizes and styles are still working as expected.  Considerations for different output   formats Depending on your output format, there may be differences in rendering your  designed report. You’ll cover some of the more common issues faced when  rendering to various output formats. When developing your report, make sure   to preview the report in the formats you plan to render, in order to avoid any  surprises after publishing your report.  Cell output When rendering to CSV, Excel, RTF, and in some respects to HTML, cell layout  becomes an important issue. The Pentaho Reporting Engine does its best to  determine the most appropriate cell layout for your report, but certain best   practices are necessary to ensure a nice looking report.  [ 114 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Alignment of elements is critical when dealing with cell output. Make sure all  horizontal and vertical alignments are accurate. Even with subtle differences   in horizontal or vertical locations, the report-to-cell-rendering algorithm can  experience difficulties.  The following screenshot shows an illustrative example. The elements in the   report aren't properly aligned.  Chapter 4  This is how the report will look in Excel:  Notice how additional cells appear before the labels. The following screenshot   shows a report where the elements are properly aligned.  This is how the Excel output will look:  [ 115 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Design and Layout in Pentaho’s Report Designer  Another consideration when working with cell-based report generators is element  overlap. Elements that overlap with one another will not render correctly, so it is  important to avoid overlaps.  Paging Certain output formats such as HTML, CSV, RTF, and Excel Output, treat the report   no matter how long the report is  as a single page. Use the page header and footer  with the knowledge that many output types will not render identically.  In relation to paging, Excel output offers the ability to treat sheets as pages, as long  as explicit page breaks are specified in the report bands using the page-break-before  and page-break-after style attributes.  Limits to rich graphics and charts While certain formats such as Excel, HTML, and PDF support images and charts,  others such as CSV, Text, and RTF do not have the capability of embedding these  rich elements. Keep that in mind when designing your reports.  Certain graphical elements such as ellipses do not render in most formats. Always  verify how a report looks by previewing in the expected format!  Summary In this chapter, you explored in-depth the ins and outs of design and layout of  reports using the Pentaho Report Designer. You first learned about the various user  interface components that make up the Report Designer. From there, you dove deep  into each reporting band and its properties. You learned that each band may be  accessed via the tree structure, and each band may display in the canvas as well as  offering properties in the property editor.  You then received an exhaustive look at all the report elements. The chapter  introduced you to the common properties seen throughout all the elements, along  with displaying the dialogs that the various attributes present when editing. You also  walked through utilizing the Menu, Toolbar, Canvas, and Shortcut keys to quickly  arrange and layout your report. This included introducing shortcuts that make it  easy to align and distribute groups of elements.  Finally, the chapter touched on additional details when dealing with fonts, along  with common issues when dealing with the various output formats that Pentaho  Reporting supports.  [ 116 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  In this chapter, you'll work with various methods for loading data into the Pentaho  Reporting Engine, and dig deep into how the Pentaho Reporting Engine interacts  with these data sources to render a report. In the second chapter, you learned how to create a static data source right within  Pentaho Report Designer. In the third chapter, you created a SQL data source   using Hypersonic. Additional data sources are available within Pentaho Report Designer, including  XML XPath, Pentaho Metadata, Multi-Dimensional Expression queries, Pentaho   Data Integration transformations, as well as scriptable data sources. At present, for  all other data sources, including Hibernate, code is required to set up and configure  the data source. With the flexibility of Pentaho Reporting, you'll learn with the help of examples how to  embed the included DataFactory implementations in your environment. You will also  learn the details of the Pentaho Reporting Engine Data API specification, allowing you  to implement your own DataFactory, if necessary.  Pentaho Reporting Engine Data API The Pentaho Reporting Engine data API is a simple API that describes how Pentaho  Reporting accesses data to populate reports. In this section, you'll learn about the  core interfaces of the API. All the individual implementations discussed later in   this chapter implement this API. There are two main Java interfaces related to the Pentaho Reporting Engine Data  API. The first interface you'll learn about is org.pentaho.reporting.engine. classic.core.DataFactory. The primary purpose of the DataFactory interface  is to generate an object that implements the javax.swing.table.TableModel  interface. The TableModel interface is a very simple API for accessing  two-dimensional cell data. These two simple APIs are combined to manage all   data input into Pentaho Reporting.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  The DataFactory interface The DataFactory interface defines seven methods, discussed in this section.  The first method is queryData:  TableModel queryData final String query, final DataRow parameters        throws ReportDataFactoryException;  The queryData method is called by the reporting engine to load a TableModel  object. This is the main factory method. Both a query name and a set of parameters  are passed to the DataFactory.  On a master report, the following built-in parameters are provided:  ::org.pentaho. reporting::query-limit ::org.pentaho. reporting::query-timeout  The maximum number of resulting rows to  be returned. If set to zero, returns all rows. The maximum time to wait for a query   to return. If set to zero, no timeout should   be used.  Also, any parameters specified in the report definition file are available as part of the  DataRow parameters object. If the query is used as part of a sub-report, parameters  passed into the sub-report from the master report are made available as well.  If there is a problem executing the query, the implementer may throw a  ReportDataFactoryException, which will be properly handled by the  reporting engine.   The second method is derive:  DataFactory derive         throws ReportDataFactoryException;  The derive method creates a new DataFactory that should be independent of  the parent DataFactory. Often times, this is simply making a call to the clone    method of the DataFactory implementation.    The third method is open:  void open   throws ReportDataFactoryException;  The open method is called during the initialization process, allowing the  DataFactory to initialize if necessary.    The fourth method is close:  void close  ;  [ 118 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 5  The close method is called once processing of all the TableModel interfaces  generated by this DataFactory is complete.  The fifth method of the DataFactory API is canExecuteQuery:  Boolean canExecuteQuery String query, DataRow parameters ;  The canExecuteQuery method returns true if the DataFactory contains the  named query.    The sixth method of the DataFactory API is getQueryNames:  String[] getQueryNames  ;  The getQueryNames method returns a list of available query names the DataFactory  interface is currently aware of.   The seventh and final method of the DataFactory API is cancelRunningQuery:   void cancelRunningQuery  ;  If supported by the implementing DataFactory, the cancelRunningQuery method  call will cancel the currently executing query of the DataFactory.  The ContextAwareDataFactory interface The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core ContextAwareDataFactory is  an extension of DataFactory, which also adds the following method for initialization:   public void initialize Configuration configuration,                  ResourceManager resourceManager,                  ResourceKey contextKey,                  ResourceBundleFactory resourceBundleFactory ;  The initialize method provides the DataFactory with access to the reporting  engine's ResourceManager, allowing the DataFactory to access resources it may  need to load properly. The ResourceManager class is the same class that is used  to load a report from the file system.  The TableModel interface The javax.swing.table.TableModel interface is part of the Java Platform API.  Pentaho Reporting uses the TableModel interface to access the two-dimensional  data necessary to render a report. Portions of the TableModel interface are not used  within the Pentaho Reporting Engine. Specifically, the following four methods are  not used:  [ 119 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  public boolean isCellEditable int rowIndex, int columnIndex ; public void setValueAt Object aValue, int rowIndex, int columnIndex ; public void addTableModelListener TableModelListener l ; public void removeTableModelListener TableModelListener l ;  All of the unused methods are related to updating a TableModel. The Pentaho  Reporting Engine uses the TableModel interface in a read-only fashion, so these  methods are not applicable. The following four methods are utilized by the   reporting engine:  public int getRowCount  ;  The getRowCount method returns the number of rows the TableModel contains.  public int getColumnCount  ;  The getColumnCount method returns the number of columns the  TableModel contains.  public String getColumnName int columnIndex ;  The getColumnName method returns the column name of the specified  column index.  public Object getValueAt int rowIndex, int columnIndex ;  The getValueAt method returns a particular cell of data based on the  specified row and column index. This is the main method for retrieving   information from the TableModel instance.  To implement your own Java data source for the Pentaho Reporting Engine, all you  need to do is implement the DataFactory and TableModel interfaces. But most  likely, you will be able to take advantage of one of the many existing DataFactory  implementations to load your data.  DataFactory serialization In addition to these core interfaces, the Data API also defines interfaces and base  implementations for serializing and de-serializing DataFactory implementations.  This makes it possible for a user to define a data source in a client tool, and  have that information available to the reporting engine during execution of the  report on the server. The related interfaces for this portion of the API are the  DataFactoryReadHandler and DataFactoryWriteHandler.  [ 120 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 5  Additional data source metadata As an extension to the TableModel, the Pentaho Reporting Engine provides the  MetaTableModel interface.  MetaTableModel defines an API to access additional  metadata that might be available as part of the data source. Examples of additional  metadata might be font or style information. One example of this in use is the  BandedMDXDataFactory implementation. Chapter 12 includes a tutorial on writing  your own MetaTableModel implementation.  Existing DataFactory implementations The following DataFactory implementations are made available as part of the  Pentaho Reporting Engine. In this section, you'll learn about the nine commonly used  DataFactory implementations, including a working example of each DataFactory.  Before you begin the examples, create a new folder called chapter5, and copy  over JAR files in the lib folder from Chapter 2 into chapter5 lib. Also, copy  the chapter2_report.prpt into the chapter5 data folder.  TableDataFactory The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.TableDataFactory  class is the simplest form of a DataFactory for loading data into the Pentaho  Reporting Engine. The TableDataFactory manages a set of existing TableModel  instances and makes them available to the reporting engine. Behind the scenes,  the TableDataFactory was used in Chapter 2. If you were to implement the same  capability in code, you would need to define the TableDataFactory explicitly. To  construct a TableDataFactory, you can either use the default constructor or the  following convenience constructor:  public TableDataFactory final String name,                           final TableModel tableModel ;  This convenience constructor adds a TableModel instance with a particular name  to the list of TableModel instances that the TableDataFactory is aware of. The  other method for adding TableModel instances to the TableDataFactory is via the  following API call:  public void addTable final String name, final TableModel tableModel ;  The addTable method adds an additional table to the list of named TableModel  instances, which are maintained by the TableDataFactory.  [ 121 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  While there is no CSV DataFactory defined, a helper class named  CSVTableModelProducer is available, which is located in the  org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules. misc.tablemodel package. This CSVTableModelProducer class  will generate another class CSVTableModel, which you could then  add to a TableDataFactory.  NamedStaticDataFactory The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.misc.datafactory  .NamedStaticDataFactory class allows you to use your own method of loading a  TableModel to populate your report. There are various ways to configure the factory.   First, you must implement the TableModel interface, and then either tell the factory  to instantiate the TableModel implementation directly or through a specified factory  class. You may want to use this over the TableDataFactory to avoid writing any  directly linking code to the Pentaho Reporting Engine API, or if you already have   a TableModel defined that you want to reuse for reporting.  NamedStaticDataFactory is often used when you would like to specify the  construction of a TableModel or its factory within the report configuration.  NamedStaticDataFactory is available in the Pentaho Report Designer as the  Named Java Method Invocation data source. You must add your classes to Report  Designer's classpath to enable previewing. You can do this by placing your JAR file  in Report Designer's lib folder. Report Designer will automatically add the JAR file  to the classpath.  Query syntax The NamedStaticDataFactory accepts a specific syntax for its query. The syntax  includes a fully-qualified class name, constructor parameters if necessary, followed  by an optional method name and method parameters. The fully-qualified class   name provided may either implement TableModel, or return a table model with  the provided method call. Here is the exactly expected syntax:     ? ''  ? ?  Method parameters are passed in as DataRow parameters. All specified parameters  in the query definition must be available in the DataRow object, which is provided  during the queryData API call.

The ExampleTableModel class uses the data from  Chapter 2, and can be constructed to return either a list of all the example JAR files  or just the example library JAR files. Create the following ExampleTableModel.java  file in the chapter5 src folder:                   }; Object columnNames[] = new Object[] {"Library Name",    {"LibBase","Library containing common functions",121745}, {"LibLoader","Loading and caching library",122900}, {"LibSerializer","Java serialization utility library",   Object data[][] = new Object[][] {        {"LibRepository","Hierarchical storage library",63655}, {"LibXml","Xml utility library",72896}, {"LibFormula","Implementation of OpenFormula",368263}, {"LibFonts","Font utility library",248320}, {"LibDocBundle","Zip bundle library",71186}, {"LibFormat","String formatting library",69464}, {"Report Engine Core","Base report engine",3375047}, {"Report Engine Extensions",   import java.util.Vector; import javax.swing.table.DefaultTableModel; public class ExampleTableModel extends DefaultTableModel {                     25689},                             "Group of common extensions",92335}                               "Library Description", "Library Size"};                                    public Vector > generateData   {                   } public Vector  getColumnNames   {            Vector > v = new Vector >  ; for  int i = 0; i < data.length; i++  {           } return v;  Vector  names = new Vector   ; for  int i = 0; i < columnNames.length; i++  {   } return names;  Vector  r = new Vector   ; for  int j = 0; j < data[i].length; j++  {   } v.add r ;  names.add columnNames[i] ;  r.add data[i][j] ;     [ 123 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  super  ; setDataVector data, columnNames ;  } public ExampleTableModel   {     } public ExampleTableModel boolean libsOnly  {                   }  super  ; if  libsOnly  {         } else {   }  setDataVector data, columnNames ;  Vector > vData = generateData  ; vData.remove vData.size   - 1 ; vData.remove vData.size   - 1 ; setDataVector vData, getColumnNames   ;                                        }  You can now use the following two strings to instantiate this TableModel for  your report, instantiating the two constructors you defined in earlier sections:  ExampleTableModel ExampleTableModel true   In addition to constructing a TableModel directly, you can also use a factory class  to instantiate the TableModel. Here is the example ExampleFactory, which simply  generates either a fully populated ExampleTableModel or one limited to just the  example libraries. Create the ExampleFactory.java file in the chapter5 src folder,  as shown next:  public ExampleTableModel getAllData   {   }  return new ExampleTableModel  ;  public class ExampleFactory {                }  public ExampleTableModel getLibData boolean libOnly  {   }  return new ExampleTableModel libOnly ;  You can now load the TableModel using the following syntax:  ExampleFactorygetAllData ExampleFactorygetLibData true   [ 124 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 5  Now that you've defined your example TableModel and factory class, you  can use NamedStaticDataFactory to instantiate these objects. First, copy  Chapter2SwingApp.java from Chapter 2 and rename it to chapter5 src  NamedStaticDataFactoryApp.java, also renaming the class definition in the  file to NamedStaticDataFactoryApp. Using the example code you created in  Chapter 2, add the following load data section to the onPreview method within the  NamedStaticDataFactoryApp class, right below loading the report object and before  instantiating the PreviewDialog:              load data NamedStaticDataFactory factory = new NamedStaticDataFactory  ; factory.setQuery "default", "ExampleFactorygetAllData" ; report.setDataFactory factory ;  This code overrides the report's data source with the NamedStaticDataFactory.  Note that you named the master report's data source default earlier in Chapter 2.  Also, make sure to add the following import at the beginning of the file:  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.misc. datafactory.NamedStaticDataFactory;  Finally, you'll need to copy the build.xml file from Chapter 2 into the chapter5  folder. Add the following Ant target to the build file:  <java fork="true" classpathref="runtime_classpath"                                        classname="NamedStaticDataFactoryApp" >     Now, type ant runstatic on the command line to view the results.  SQLReportDataFactory The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.misc. datafactory.sql.SQLReportDataFactory class allows you to easily use JDBC and  SQL to populate your reports. In Chapter 3, the SQLReportDataFactory was used  behind the scenes.   To set up the SQLReportDataFactory correctly in your environment, you first  need to create an instance of ConnectionProvider. Three ConnectionProvider  implementations are available for use. The ConnectionProvider interface and three  implementations are available in the same package as SQLReportDataFactory.   The ConnectionProvider interface defines a single getConnection method,  which should return a JDBC connection for SQLReportDataFactory to use when  generating a result set to populate a report.

It is recommended to avoid using DriverConnectionProvider, as it will  create a new connection to the underlying database every time the getConnection  method is called on the API. The DriverConnectionProvider has a default  constructor, and must be configured via setter methods that are provided below:  void setDriver String driver ;  The setDriver method's driver value should be set to the fully qualified name  of the driver class used in JDBC.  void setUrl String url ;  The setUrl method's URL value should be set to the JDBC URL for  connecting to a database.  void setProperty String name, String value ;  The setProperty method adds an additional property to the JDBC  configuration properties. Properties such as username and password are   often passed in through the properties list for a new connection to be generated   via java.sql.DriverManager. Make sure to include the JDBC driver JAR file in  your Java classpath when using DriverConnectionProvider.  JndiConnectionProvider The third available ConnectionProvider is the JndiConnectionProvider. The  JndiConnectionProvider uses Java's Naming and Directory Interface  JNDI   to obtain a connection to a database. The JndiConnectionProvider has a default  constructor, along with the following setter methods that may be configured to  connect to a JNDI data source. Only the connection path property is mandatory:  void setConnectionPath String connectionPath ;  [ 126 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   The setConnectionPath method should be set to the full JNDI path of your JDBC  data source. Examples of JNDI paths are provided later in this section.  Chapter 5  void setUsername String username ;  The setUsername method is an optional field, which may be required  when connecting to your data source.  void setPassword String password ;  The setPassword method is an optional field, which may be required  when connecting to your data source.  JNDI is available in many application servers. It may also be used in a regular Java  application with the help of Simple JNDI, available at http:  www.osjava.org  simple-jndi. The following table shows the examples of JNDI connection strings  in different environments, assuming that you've already configured the JNDI data  sources in that environment:  Tomcat JBoss Simple JNDI  java:comp env jdbc   java:  No Standard, configurable to match other  containers  Once a ConnectionProvider has been created, it's now time to set up a  SQLReportDataFactory instance. The SQLReportDataFactory contains  two constructors. The first constructor takes a ConnectionProvider.  The second constructor takes an existing Connection, which uses the  StaticConnectionProvider under the hood to provide the connection.  In addition to configuring the ConnectionProvider, you also must provide  SQLReportDataFactory with queries to execute. Use the setQuery method  to configure named queries:  void setQuery final String name, final String queryString   The setQuery method takes in the name of the query and the SQL query itself.  As mentioned earlier, the master report in the examples in this chapter use the   name "default" to reference the main query.  To incorporate report parameters into the query, you may specify variables   with the following format in your SQL:  ${ }  [ 127 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  A PreparedStatement is generated, and these variables are parameterized  appropriately via the JDBC specification, in order to avoid potential SQL injection  attacks. In addition to traditional SQL statements, you may also make a call to a SQL  stored procedure.  These calls begin with the string "call", and are recognized by the  SQLReportDataFactory so that the correct JDBC API method is executed.  As mentioned earlier, the Query Limit and Query Timeout parameters made  available to all DataFactory instances also apply to the SQLReportDataFactory.  These values are passed on to the Connection object. Therefore, the underlying  JDBC driver must also support these properties to have an effect.  SQLReportDataFactory example In this example, you'll define a SQLReportDataFactory to populate your report. First,  you'll need to define a file-based HSQLDB data source, similar to the data source  defined in Chapter 3. Place the library data in a tab delimited file, or use the provided  libraries.txt tab delimited file. Copy this file into the chapter5 data folder. Now,  create the data libraryinfo.script file with a simple HSQLDB text table:  CREATE SCHEMA PUBLIC AUTHORIZATION DBA CREATE TEXT TABLE LIBRARYINFO NAME VARCHAR,DESCRIPTION VARCHAR,                                SIZE INTEGER  SET TABLE LIBRARYINFO SOURCE "libraries.txt;fs=\t;ignore_first=true" CREATE USER SA PASSWORD ""  GRANT DBA TO SA  Now that you've defined the data source, make sure to place the hsqldb.jar file,  located in Pentaho Report Designer's lib folder, in the chapter5 lib folder. You're  now ready to add the embedded data source code. As in the earlier example, add  the following load data section to the onPreview method, within a freshly copied  Chapter2SwingApp, which would be renamed to SQLReportDataFactoryApp:     load report sql data DriverConnectionProvider provider = new DriverConnectionProvider  ;  provider.setDriver "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver" ;  provider.setProperty "user", "sa" ;  provider.setProperty "pass", "" ;  provider.setUrl "jdbc:hsqldb:file:data libraryinfo" ; SQLReportDataFactory dataFactory = new SQLReportDataFactory provider ; String sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM LIBRARYINFO";  dataFactory.setQuery "default", sqlQuery ;  report.setDataFactory dataFactory ;  [ 128 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 5  Also, make sure to add the following imports at the beginning of the file:  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.misc. datafactory.sql.DriverConnectionProvider; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.misc. datafactory.sql.SQLReportDataFactory;  Due to the naming of column headers in the HSQLDB database, you must also modify  the sample report. Copy chapter2_report.prpt to chapter5 data sql_report. prpt, and change the following referenced field names in Pentaho Report Designer:   	 Library Name to NAME  	 Library Description to DESCRIPTION  	 Library Size to SIZE  Also change the Total Library Size function’s Field Name to SIZE. Once you've  saved your changes, update the SQLReportDataFactoryApp class with the new  location of the report PRPT file. Finally, you'll need to add the following Ant target to your build.xml file:  <java fork="true" classpathref="runtime_classpath"                                          classname="SQLReportDataFactoryApp" >     Type ant runsql on the command line to verify the results.   XPathDataFactory The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. xpath.XPathDataFactory class allows you to populate your report based on  XML data, provided that it is formatted in a specific way. This DataFactory accepts  XML formatted as rows and columns, where the XPath expression returns a list  of row elements that contain column elements. Each column element's node name  represents the column name, and each column's text data represents the column's  value. An example of a row supported by XPathDataFactory might be:            Row 1 Data In Column 1   Row 1 Data In Column 2   By default, column values are typed as Java Strings. The XPathDataFactory  provides a mechanism to specify certain Java data types, including the following:   	 java.lang.String  	 java.sql.Date  [ 129 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources   	 java.math.BigDecimal  	 java.sql.Timestamp  	 java.lang.Integer  	 java.lang.Double  	 java.lang.Long  These types can be specified in the XML as either a preprocessor step or a comment:  Preprocessor step  Root document comment Root   comment  <?pentaho-dataset java.lang.Integer, java. lang.String?>      The column types should appear in the same order as the elements in the first row.  Beyond the first row, the order of columns is not relevant. The names of the columns  will be used to place them in the correct position of the generated TableModel. The  java.sql.Date and java.sql.Timestamp classes both require a long numeric value  corresponding to milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.  To create an XPathDataFactory, use the default constructor. To configure the  XPathDataFactory, you must specify an XML file, along with a set of XPath queries.   For a good introduction to XPath, please see http:  www.w3.org TR xpath.   The XPathDataFactory uses Pentaho Reporting Engine's ResourceManager  for loading the XPath file.  To set the location of the XML file, use the  setXQueryDataFile method:  void setXqueryDataFile String filename ;  Named queries may be added with the setQuery method:  Void setQuery String name, String xpath ;  One additional note, there is no standard way to easily sort row data via XPath,  so be sure to have your data in the correct order before loading it with the  XPathDataFactory. The inability to sort limits the capabilities of this DataFactory.

Save the following simple XML   file as chapter5 data xpathexample.xml:          LibBase   Base library containing common functions                                              LibLoader   Loading and caching library   53552                   113210   Due to the verbosity of XML, this example is limited to a couple of rows. Once  you've created the XML file, you need to deploy the correct extension JAR files   to the chapter5 lib directory. Copy the pentaho-reporting-engine-classic -extensions-xpath.jar file, located in the Report Designer's lib folder, into the  chapter5 lib folder.    Now, you're ready to write some code. As in the earlier examples, add the  following load data section to the onPreview method within a freshly copied  Chapter2SwingApp, renamed to XPathDataFactoryApp:      load report xpath data  XPathDataFactory factory = new XPathDataFactory  ; factory.setXqueryDataFile "file:data xpathexample.xml" ; factory.setQuery "default", " ExampleResultSet Row" ; report.setDataFactory factory ;  Also, make sure to add the following import at the beginning of the file:  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. xpath.XPathDataFactory;  [ 131 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  Due to the naming of column headers in XPathDataFactory being mapped to the  element node names in the XML file, you must also modify the sample report.   Copy chapter2_report.prpt to chapter5 data xpath_report.prpt, and change  the referenced field names in Pentaho Report Designer, as shown in the following  bullet list:   	 Library Name to NAME  	 Library Description to DESCRIPTION  	 Library Size to SIZE  Also change the Total Library Size function's Field Name to SIZE. Once you've saved  your changes, update the XPathDataFactoryApp class with the new location of the  report PRPT file.  Finally, you'll need to add the following Ant target to your build.xml file:  <java fork="true" classpathref="runtime_classpath"                                             classname="XPathDataFactoryApp" >     Type ant runxpath on the command line to verify the results.  HQLDataFactory The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. hibernate.HQLDataFactory class allows you to populate your report based on  a Hibernate query. Hibernate is an open source relational persistence engine.  Hibernate allows you to easily persist your Java objects to a database.  Much like many of the other DataFactory implementations, the HQLDataFactory  is configured with information to connect to Hibernate, along with the ability  to specify named queries. The HQLDataFactory API defines an interface called  SessionProvider, which it uses to gain access to the current Hibernate Session  object. The SessionProvider contains a single API method, getSession  , which  returns an instance of org.hibernate.Session. There are two implemented  versions of this session provider.  At this time, HQLDataFactory is not available as a data source within Pentaho  Report Designer, so code is required to utilize Hibernate as a data source.  [ 132 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   StaticSessionProvider The StaticSessionProvider simply takes in an org.hibernate.Session object  as a constructor parameter, making available the already existing Session object to  the HQLDataFactory. This would be used if your system already has an initialized  Hibernate session.  Chapter 5  DefaultSessionProvider The DefaultSessionProvider requires no constructor parameters, and uses  the following API call to generate a SessionFactory from Hibernate:  sessionFactory = new Configuration  .configure  . buildSessionFactory  ;  The created sessionFactory instance is used to create new sessions, which  the HQLDataFactory uses to query Hibernate.  The HQLDataFactory provides two constructors. The first constructor takes in a  SessionProvider, as described above. The second constructor simply takes in a  Hibernate Session instance, which it uses to query Hibernate. This constructor  uses a StaticSessionProvider, under the covers, to pass in the Session to  HQLDataFactory.  Once you've instantiated your factory, you may add named queries to the factory   by making the following API call:  void setQuery String name, String queryString ;  The setQuery method takes in the name of the query, and the Hibernate query,  in order to execute.    HQLDataFactory uses Hibernate's query language, which is well-documented  at http:  www.hibernate.org hib_docs reference en html queryhql. html You may include report parameters in your query by using the HQL syntax  ":ParameterName" The max results and query timeout parameters are supported  by HQLDataFactory.

To begin, download the latest version of Hibernate from  http:  www.hibernate.org. This example uses version 3.2.6.ga. Place the  hibernate.jar file and all the JAR files from the Hibernate distribution's lib  folder into the chapter5 lib folder. You must also deploy the pentaho- reporting-engine-classic-extensions-hibernate.jar file, located in  Pentaho Report Designer's lib folder, into the chapter5 lib folder.    In the SQLReportDataFactory example given earlier, you defined an HSQLDB  data source. You'll reuse that data source in this example. Once you've moved  the appropriate JAR files into Chapter 5, you'll need to define a simple Java class,  chapter5 src LibraryInfo.java, which maps to your HSQLDB data source:  return name;  this.name = name;  public class LibraryInfo {                                             }  private String name; private String description; private long size; public LibraryInfo   {} public void setName String name  {   } public String getName   {   } public void setDescription String description  {   } public String getDescription   {   } public void setSize long size  {   } public long getSize   {   }  this.description = description;  return description;  this.size = size;  return size;  [ 134 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 5  Define the Hibernate mapping between the HSQLDB database and the LibraryInfo  class, saved as chapter5 src LibraryInfo.hbm.xml:    <!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC         "-  Hibernate Hibernate Mapping DTD 3.0  EN"         "http:  hibernate.sourceforge.net hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">                            Now, you're ready to configure the Hibernate settings file with the appropriate   JDBC information and mapping input.

PmdDataFactory class allows you to populate your report, using a Pentaho Metadata  Query. Pentaho Metadata allows a database administrator to define a business layer  of their relational data for end users, simplifying the ability to query the data, as  well as protecting users from the complexities that may exist in a database schema.  Pentaho's Metadata Query Language  MQL  is an XML-based query model that  simplifies querying databases, and is currently used within the Pentaho Report  Designer and Pentaho Web Ad Hoc Report client tools.  In order for PmdDataFactory to initialize properly, it must have access to certain  Pentaho Metadata configuration properties that can be configured at runtime, or   be passed in by a configuration file.  XMI file The XMI file contains a serialized version of the defined metadata model, and  is required in order to execute MQL queries. The XMI file contains information  including how to connect to the relational data source, as well as the business  model mapping of the relational data. This file is loaded at runtime into the  configured repository of Pentaho Metadata. The XMI file may be configured by  calling the setXmiFile method. This file is loaded with Pentaho Reporting Engine's  ResourceManager.  Domain Id The metadata domain id is used to map a name to the XMI file within the metadata  repository. This name is also referenced in the MQL query file. Therefore, it is  important to use the same name in the MQL query, as well as the PmdDataFactory.   The domain may be set by the setDomainId method.  IPmdConnectionProvider PmdDataFactory uses the IPmdConnectionProvider interface to obtain the  metadata domain objects as well as the database connection for the query. The  IPmdConnectionProvider must be specified via the setConnectionProvider  method. A default implementation, PmdConnectionProvider, manages loading  the XMI file as well as determining the database connection to be used based on  metadata information provided in the XMI file. The IPmdConnectionProvider  defines the following methods:  [ 137 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources     returns a connection object based on the relational data source Connection gu8etConnection DatabaseMeta databaseMeta  throws  ReportDataFactoryException;     returns a metadata repository based on the domain id and xmi file IMetadataDomainRepository getMetadataDomainRepository String domain,   ResourceManager resourceManager, ResourceKey contextKey, String  xmiFile  throws ReportDataFactoryException;  Registering MQL Queries Once you've configured the PmdDataFactory correctly, you need to provide named  MQL queries via the setQuery String name, String query  method. Please see  http:  wiki.pentaho.com display ServerDoc2x 03.+Pentaho+Metadata+MQL+ Schema to learn more about the MQL query format.  PmdDataFactory example To begin, you'll need to build a very simple Pentaho Metadata model. First,  download Pentaho Metadata Editor from SourceForge: http:  sourceforge.net  projects pentaho. Click on the Download link, and select the Pentaho Metadata  package. Download the latest "pme-ce" zip or tar distribution, depending on  your operating system environment. For Windows, unzip the download, and run  metadata-editor.bat. For Linux and Mac, untar the download and run  metadata-editor.sh. From the main window, select File  new Domain File...  Now, it's time to define your physical model. Right-click on the Connections tree  item and select New Connection...  Name the Connection Library Info and select  Hypersonic as the connection type. Set the Host Name to file: and the Database  Name to the full path to your example libraryinfo.script file minus the .script  file extension.

You may also consider doing this example without the necessity  of the load data section, by adding a Metadata data source to  your report within Pentaho Report Designer.  KettleDataFactory The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. kettle.KettleDataFactory class allows you to populate your report from a Kettle  transformation. Kettle is a data integration tool, also known as an ETL  Extract  Transform and Load  tool. Kettle transformations support a multitude of data  source inputs and transformation capabilities. Kettle, also known as Pentaho Data  Integration, provides mechanisms to incorporate data from Excel, SQL, XML, Text,  and many other data sources. It also provides the ability to combine the results into   a single result set, which Pentaho Reporting can use to render a report.

This is done via the KettleTransformationProducer interface. There  are two provided implementations of KettleTransformationProducer. The first  is KettleTransFromFileProducer, which loads a Kettle transformation from the  file system. The KettleTransFromFileProducer class must be instantiated with the  following parameters:  final String repositoryName,    the repository name final String transformationFile,    the path of the tranformation file  to execute final String stepName,    the step name to collect data from final String username,    the repository user name final String password,    the repository password final String[] definedArgumentNames,    the names of reporting  properties to be passed into Kettle via Transformation Arguments final ParameterMapping[] definedVariableNames    the names of  reporting properties to be passed into Kettle via Transformation  Parameters  The second implementation of KettleTransformationProducer is  KettleTransFromRepositoryProducer. This loads the transformation from an  existing Kettle Repository. The kettleTransFromRepositoryProducer class must  be instantiated with the following parameters:  final String repositoryName,    the repository name final String directoryName,    the repository directory final String transformationName,    the transformation name in the  repository final String stepName,    the step name to collect data from final String username,    the repository user name final String password,    the repository password final String[] definedArgumentNames,    the names of reporting  properties to be passed into Kettle via Transformation Arguments final ParameterMapping[] definedVariableNames    the names of  reporting properties to be passed into Kettle via Transformation  Parameters  The KettleDataFactory has a default constructor. To add Kettle  transformation queries to the KettleDataFactory, call the  setQuery String, KettleTransformationProducer  method.

Download  Pentaho Data Integration 3.2 from SourceForge: http:  sourceforge.net  projects pentaho. Click on the Download link, and select the Data Integration  package. Download the latest "pdi-ce" ZIP  compressed file , TAR, or DMG  distribution, depending on your operating system environment. Install the  distribution. To bring up the user interface, run Kettle.exe if you are a Windows  user. For Linux and Mac users, run spoon.sh. On Kettle's intro screen, select the button No Repository. Kettle allows you to store  and manage your transformations in a central repository, but you won't be using that  feature in this example. In the main window, double-click on the Transformations folder to begin creating  your first transformation. Drag-and-drop a Table input step from the step's Input  folder into your transformation. Double-click on the new step to configure the   Table input.  In the Table input dialog, first configure a new connection to your HSQLDB   file-based database. Click the New... button next to the Connection. In the Database Connection dialog, enter the Connection Name as Library Info and  select Hypersonic as the Connection Type. Set the Database Name to the full path  to your example, that is, libraryinfo.script file minus the .script file extension.  Set the Host Name to file: and the Port Number to blank. Finally, set the user name  to sa and password to blank.

Finally, save  your transformation as chapter5 data libraryinfo.ktr.  Now that you've created your transformation file, it's time to set up the DataFactory.  First, you must place the necessary JAR files into the chapter5 lib folder. You'll  need to place all the JAR files located in Kettle's lib and libext folders into the  chapter5 lib folder. Also, you'll need to place the pentaho-reporting-engine- classic-extensions-kettle.jar file, located in the Pentaho Report Designer lib  folder, into the chapter5 lib folder as well.  This example also uses the libraryinfo.script and libraries.txt files you  defined earlier, so make sure they are available in the chapter5 data folder. Now,  you are ready to go ahead and add a new load data section to the onPreview method  within a freshly copied Chapter2SwingApp, renamed to KettleDataFactoryApp:     load Kettle data source     Initialize Kettle EnvUtil.environmentInit  ; StepLoader.init  ; JobEntryLoader.init  ;    Build Data Factory KettleTransFromFileProducer producer = new KettleTransFromFileProducer  "Embedded Repository", "data libraryinfo.ktr", "Table input", "", "",  new String[0], new ParameterMapping[0] ; KettleDataFactory factory = new KettleDataFactory  ; factory.setQuery "default", producer ; report.setDataFactory factory ;  StepLoader and JobLoader both may throw a KettleException, so you must also add  the following catch block to the end of the onPreview method:  catch  KettleException e  {   }  e.printStackTrace  ;  You must also add the following imports to complete the example:  import org.pentaho.di.core.exception.KettleException; import org.pentaho.di.core.util.EnvUtil; import org.pentaho.di.job.JobEntryLoader; import org.pentaho.di.trans.StepLoader; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.ParameterMapping; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. kettle.KettleTransFromFileProducer; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. kettle.KettleDataFactory;  [ 147 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  Due to the names of column headers in this example, you must also modify your  sample report. Copy chapter2_report.prpt to chapter5 data kettle_report. prpt, and change the column names, as shown in the following bullet list:   	 Library Name to NAME  	 Library Description to DESCRIPTION  	 Library Size to SIZE  Also change the Total Library Size function’s Field Name to SIZE. Once you've  saved your changes, update the KettleDataFactoryApp class with the new location  of the report PRPT file.  Finally, you'll need to add the following Ant target to the build.xml file:  <java fork="true" classpathref="runtime_classpath"                                            classname="KettleDataFactoryApp" >     Type ant runkettle on the command line to view the results!  BandedMDXDataFactory The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. olap4j.BandedMDXDataFactory class allows you to populate your report from  An olap4j data source. olap4j is a Java API for connecting to multi-dimensional  OLAP  Online Analytical Processing  data sources. As of olap4j 0.9.7.145, there  is a driver written for the Mondrian Relational OLAP Engine, as well as an  Extensible Markup Language for Analysis  XMLA  driver implementation, which  provides communication with Microsoft Analysis Services, along with other XMLA  compatible OLAP services.  Natively, OLAP data sources support result sets with more than two axes. In a  traditional result set used by Pentaho Reporting, there are column headers, along  with rows of data.  When using OLAP data, the data source needs to determine how  to map the richer OLAP data into a standard TableModel data source.  With BandedMDXDataFactory, the factory maps the row and column axes of the  OLAP result set to a TableModel. The column headers display the dimensions  selected in the column axis. The rows show the row axis information selected. For  instance, if a year was selected from the time dimension on the column axis, in the  column header you would see the member name [Time].[1997]. To learn more about olap4j and Mondrian's Relational OLAP engine, please visit  http:  www.olap4j.org and http:  mondrian.pentaho.org.

The DriverConnectionProvider provides an implementation.  The DriverConnectionProvider contains a default constructor, and may  be configured with the following methods:  void setDriver String driver ;  The setDriver method specifies the driver class to use.  void setURL String url ;  The setURL method specifies the URL the driver should connect to.  void setProperty String name, String value ;  The setProperty method specifies additional connection properties.  After creating a valid OlapConnectionProvider, pass that object into the  BandedMDXDataFactory constructor. Once you've created the factory, you may  add Multi-dimensional Expression  MDX  queries by calling the setQuery  String name, String mdxQuery  method.  BandedMDXDataFactory example To begin this example, you first need to create a simple OLAP model that you  can query.  First, download Mondrian's Schema Workbench from the following  SourceForge URL: http:  sourceforge.net projects mondrian. Once you've  unzipped the Schema Workbench, copy the hsqldb.jar into the workbench  drivers folder. To bring up the main window, run workbench.bat in Windows,  or run workbench.sh if you are a Mac or Linux user. Before you design an OLAP  Model, first configure your relational data source. Select the menu item Tools   Preferences. Now, specify the necessary JDBC information. Set org.hsqldb. jdbcDriver for the Driver Class Name and jdbc:hsqldb:file:c:\path\to\chapter5\ data\libraryinfo for the Connection URL. Finally, set the username to sa, and the  password to blank. Now, click the Accept button.

Right-click on the schema and select  the add Cube menu item. Name the Cube as Library Info. Select the cube's Table  tree node and set the name attribute of the Table to Library Info. This will act as  your fact table. Now, right-click on the cube and select the Add Dimension menu  item. Set the dimension name to Library. Because you're using the fact table for the  dimension, also known as a degenerate dimension, there is no need for a foreign key.  Right-click on the Table element within the Hierarchy and select the Delete menu  item. This element is also not needed. Right-click on the Hierarchy and select the Add Level menu item. Set the level's  name attribute to Library Name, and the column attribute to NAME. Now, right- click on the level and select the Add Property menu item. Rename the property to  LibDescription and set the column attribute to DESCRIPTION. Set the type attribute  to String. Finally, right-click on the Library Info cube again and select the Add Measure menu  item.  Set the measure's name to Size, and enter SIZE for the column attribute. Select  sum for the aggregator.  You're now done creating a very simple OLAP model. Go ahead and save this model  to data libraryinfo.mondrian.xml. Once saved, verify the model by selecting the  menu item File  New  MDX Query, and typing in the following query:  [ 150 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 5  WITH MEMBER [Measures].[Name] AS '[Library].CurrentMember.Caption' MEMBER [Measures].[Description] AS '[Library].CurrentMember. Properties "LibDescription" ' select [Library].Children on rows, {[Measures].[Name], [Measures].[Des cription], [Measures].[Size]} on columns from [Library Info]  Make sure results are returned.    Now that you have your OLAP schema file defined, you're ready to begin interfacing  the OLAP data source with Pentaho Reporting. First, you must copy over the   necessary JAR files. Place all the JAR files that exist in the workbench lib folder  in chapter5 lib folder. Also, place the pentaho-reporting-engine-classic- extensions-olap4j.jar and olap4j.jar files, found in Pentaho Reporting's lib  folder, into the chapter5 lib folder.  Add the following load data section to the onPreview method within a freshly  copied Chapter2SwingApp, renamed to BandedMDXDataFactoryApp:     load olap data  DriverConnectionProvider provider = new  DriverConnectionProvider  ; provider.setDriver "mondrian.olap4j.MondrianOlap4jDriver" ; provider.setUrl "jdbc:mondrian: " ; provider.setProperty "Catalog", "data libraryinfo.mondrian.xml" ; provider.setProperty "JdbcUser", "sa" ; provider.setProperty "JdbcPassword", "" ; provider.setProperty "Jdbc", "jdbc:hsqldb:file:data libraryinfo" ; provider.setProperty "JdbcDrivers", "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver" ;     create the factory     add the MDX query  BandedMDXDataFactory factory = new BandedMDXDataFactory provider ;  factory.setQuery "default", "WITH MEMBER [Measures].[Name] AS  '[Library].CurrentMember.Caption' MEMBER [Measures].[Description]  AS '[Library].CurrentMember.Properties \"LibDescription\" '  select [Library].Children on rows, {[Measures].[Name], [Measures]. [Description], [Measures].[Size]} on columns from [Library Info]" ;  report.setDataFactory factory ;  You must also add the following imports to complete the example:  import  org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. olap4j.DriverConnectionProvider; import  org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. olap4j.BandedMDXDataFactory;  [ 151 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Working with Data Sources  Due to the built in naming of column headers in BandedMDXDataFactory, you  must also modify your sample report. Copy the  chapter2_report.prpt to  chapter5 data banded_mdx_report.prpt, and change the column names as  shown in the following bullet list:   	 Library Name to [Measures].[Name]  	 Library Description to [Measures].[Description]  	 Size to [Measures].[Size]  Also change the Total Library Size function’s Field Name to [Measures].[Size].  Once you've saved your changes, update BandedMDXDataFactoryApp with the  correct PRPT file to load. Finally, you'll need to add the following Ant target to   the build.xml file:  <java fork="true" classpathref="runtime_classpath"                                          classname="BandedMDXDataFactoryApp" >     Type ant runmdx on the command line to view the results.   You may also consider doing this example without the necessity  of the load data section, by adding an olap4j data source to your  report within Pentaho Report Designer.  DenormalizedMDXDataFactory The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions.datasources. olap4j.DenormalizedMDXDataFactory class queries an olap4j data source in a  similar fashion as the BandedMDXDataFactory. The only difference is the mapping  from OLAP to a two-dimensional result set.  The DenormalizedMDXDataFactory maps all the axes of the OLAP result set to a  TableModel, in a denormalized or flattened fashion. The column headers display the  dimensional metadata selected in the axes, as well as the measure metadata selected.  For instance, if a year was selected from the time dimension, in the column header  you would see the level name [Time].[Year]. DenormalizedMDXDataFactory is often  used with crosstabs, and will be used again in Chapter 8.

For instance, with CompoundDataFactory, you  may use a SQLReportDataFactory for your master report query, as well as an  XPathDataFactory for a sub-report query. The CompoundDataFactory has a default  constructor, and you may add child data factories by calling the add DataFactory   or add index, DataFactory  methods. DataFactory instances are queried in the  order of their index.  All reports generated by the Report Designer use the CompoundDataFactory,  making it possible for users to add different types of data sources to their report   in the user interface.  Experimental data factories Additionally, there are community contributed DataFactory implementations  that are available. Two examples include the XQJReportDataFactory, which uses  the javax.xml.xquery API to query XML database data sources, as well as the  ScriptableDataFactory, which uses the Bean Scripting Framework to execute query  scripts in different scripting languages that return a TableModel implementation.  Accessing data throughout a report Once you've configured your DataFactory implementation, it is important to  know how to access this data within a report. As mentioned in the previous   chapter, elements that contain the field name property access row data via the  column headers provided by the data source. In addition to accessing the fields  directly, you may also access this data in functions and formulas.  Functions in Pentaho Reporting will contain a property named "Field" or "Fields"  that allow you to select a list of fields from the defined data source. To reference   a field in a formula, you will need to place brackets around the field name. An  example reference to a field name in a formula might be "[Library Description]".  When using a DataFactory that isn't supported directly in the Report Designer  such as the Hibernate HQLDataFactory, you will need to manually type in the name  of the fields into the Report Designer. Another issue with using non-supported  DataFactory classes in the Report Designer is that the report preview won't be  available for use. One strategy to avoid these issues is to build a sample dataset,  which contains the identical column headers in a Report Designer supported  DataFactory implementation, in order to verify that reports look as expected.

The Data API provides a rich, easy-to-implement mechanism for providing data to  a report. The DataFactory interface, along with the TableModel interface, make up  the backbone of this API. Additional capabilities of this API include the ability to  serialize connection information, as well as provide a richer set of metadata for result  sets by using MetaTableModel.  Out of the box, the Pentaho Reporting Engine comes with a rich set of DataFactory  implementations that make it possible to connect to practically any type of backend  data, including Java Objects, JDBC, XML XPath, HQL, Pentaho Metadata, Pentaho  Integration, and OLAP data sources.   Once you've configured access to your underlying data, it's simple to reference that  data within your report, via report elements, functions, and formulas.

You'll learn about the different types of charts supported, and how to  configure them in Pentaho Report Designer. You'll also learn how to populate a   chart with various types of data.  In addition to learning all about charts, this chapter also covers the various methods  for including visual information in your report, including embedding images and  Java graphics in your report.  Supported charts Pentaho Reporting relies on JFreeChart, an open source Java chart library, for  charting visualization within reports. From within Report Designer, many chart  types are supported. In the chart editor, two areas of properties appear when   editing a chart. The first area of properties is related to chart rendering, and the  second tabbed area of properties is related to the data that populates a chart.

The first type  is known as a Category Dataset, where the dataset series and values are grouped  by categories. A series is like a sub-group. If the exact category and series appear,   the chart will sum the values into a single result. The following table is a simple  example of a category dataset:  Category Store 1 Sales Store 1 Sales Store 2 Sales Store 2 Sales  Series Cash Credit Cash Credit  Sale Price $14 $12 $100 $120  Pentaho Reporting builds a Category Dataset using the CategorySetDataCollector.   Also available is the PivotCategorySetCollector, which pivots the category and  series data. Collector classes implement Pentaho Reporting’s Function API. The second type of dataset is known as an XY Series Dataset, which is a two  dimensional group of values that may be plotted in various forms. In this dataset,   the series may be used to draw different lines, and so on. Here is a simple example   of an XY series dataset:  [ 156 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 6  Series Cash Credit Cash Credit  Cost of Goods  X  10 11 92 105  Sale Price  Y  14 12 100 120  Note that X is often referred to as the domain, and Y is referred to as the range.  Pentaho Reporting builds an XY Series Dataset using the XYSeriesCollector.  The XYZSeriesCollector also exists for three dimensional data. The third type of dataset is known as a Time Series Dataset, which is a two  dimensional group of values that are plotted based on a time and date. The Time Series  Dataset is more like an XY Series than a Category Dataset, as the time scale is displayed  in a linear fashion with appropriate distances between the different time references.

Common chart rendering properties Most charts share a common set of properties. The following properties are common  across most charts. Any exceptions are mentioned as part of the specific chart type.  Required Property Group Property name name  data-source  no-data-message  Description The name of the chart object within the report. This is not  displayed during rendering, but must be unique in the report.  A default name is generated for each chart added to the report. The dataset name for the chart, which is automatically  populated with the name of the dataset in the Primary  DataSource panel of the chart editor. The message to display if no data is available to render the  chart.

Double-click on the element,  or right-click on the element and select Edit Content to select the static image. This  brings up a resource dialog, where you can browse to the specific file location. You  may Link to or Embed the image in the PRPT file. An example of a static image,  with the ElectroBarn logo, is provided in Chapter 3. The image report element uses Pentaho Reporting's ResourceManager API to  load the image. The ResourceManager interface is located in the org.pentaho. reporting.libraries.resourceloader package.    from   Including dynamic images in your report To add dynamic images to your report, use the content-field report element  . The  content field accepts different types of image inputs for rendering. The first approach  is dynamically changing the image location within your dataset. If you have a field  that contains a URL or file system location to your image, the content-field element  will render the specified image.   The second approach is to populate the content-field with an object of type java.awt. Image for rendering. This approach would require a custom-implemented TableModel   as described in Chapter 5 , or a custom function that returns an Image object.    The third approach is to populate the content-field with an object that contains the  following method, which is determined through Java introspection:  void draw Graphics2D g2, Rectangle2D area ;  In addition to this API, Pentaho Reporting also defines an extended org.pentaho. reporting.engine.classic.core.util.ReportDrawable API with the following  methods, for more detailed access into the report rendering process:   	 void draw Graphics2D g2, Rectangle2D area ;  	 void setConfiguration Configuration config ;   	 void setStyleSheet StyleSheet style ;  [ 182 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com    	 void setResourceBundleFactory ResourceBundleFactory   bundleFactory ;   	 ImageMap getImageMap final Rectangle2D bounds ;  A custom TableModel implementation or custom function would also be required to  make this object available to the Reporting engine.  Chapter 6  Summary In this chapter, you learned how to incorporate many chart types into your reports  in many different ways. You learned how to configure a chart's dataset as well as  customizing how each chart type looks in a report.  You learned how to populate a  category series dataset, as well as an XY series dataset, and make that data available  to the various types of charts that render in your report. You also learned how to  include static and dynamic images, as well as graphics, in your reports.

You'll then  learn about all the predefined functions and expressions available for use within  a report. From there, you'll learn about Pentaho Reporting's formula capabilities,  including the correct syntax and available formula methods. Finally, you'll learn  about the details involved in internationalizing a report.  Report parameterization Report parameterization allows end users to customize results of Pentaho reports,  by entering values that limit report datasets or trigger rendering decisions. Using   the DataFactory API, Pentaho Reporting provides a mechanism to provide  parameters to data sources. As presented in Chapter 5, there are many different  options for providing data to Pentaho Reporting. Each data source type uses its  underlying method for parameterizing queries. For instance, the default syntax for  XPATH, Kettle, MDX, and Hibernate Query Language are supported through their  respective DataFactory implementations. Each data source query syntax defines  how to specify parameters, and Pentaho Reporting provides those parameters via   the DataRow API.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Parameterization, Functions, Formulas, and Internationalization in Reports  The two exceptions from the default management of parameters include SQL and  static data. When specifying a SQL statement in JDBC, you would normally specify  a question mark to denote which parameters should be specified. Pentaho Reporting  requires that you specify the parameters by name, so some parsing is done on  the SQL query before passing the query to JDBC. You may specify parameters as  ${PARAM}, and the SQLReportDataFactory will replace each named parameter with  a question mark  ?  before making the prepared JDBC call.  The NamedStaticDataFactory allows for Java class methods with parameters to be  executed. The names provided when configuring the DataFactory are used when  resolving the values from the DataRow provided.  Providing report parameters In Chapter 3, you implemented two example reports that used report  parameterization. The first report parameterization was done as part of the End of  the Day Cashiers report example. You defined a Sessions dataset to populate a drop  down within Pentaho Report Designer, which determined the results of the report.    The second parameterization example was in the definition of the sub-report in the  Invoice report example. The sub-report defined the parameter ${CUSTOMERID}, and  the value was available to the sub-report, based on the current data row retrieved  from the primary report. Both of these are examples of parameterization.  To provide a master report with parameters, you need to access the parameter  values collection from the master report. To do this, call MasterReport. getParameterValues  . Then you may add parameters to the report by calling  ReportParameterValues.put column, value . The ReportParameterValues  class implements the DataRow API, which makes it possible to pass these parameters  to the various DataFactory implementations.  Available report parameter types Pentaho Reporting defines the following parameter types, which each render  differently within Pentaho Report Designer and Pentaho's BI Server:   	 Drop Down  	 Single Value List  	 Multi Value List  	 Radio Button  	 Check Box  [ 186 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 7   	 Single Selection Button  	 Multi Selection Button  	 Text Box  When embedding Pentaho Reporting into a custom application, it is the embedded  program's responsibility to render parameters, as demonstrated in Chapter 3.  All parameter types may specify a data source for population of possible selections,  as well as for validation. It is possible to nest parameters by parameterizing the data  sources, which are used to populate selections. For example, a top level drop-down  parameter such as Country could drive a secondary radio button parameter such as  Region. Queries are executed in the order in which they appear in the data source list.  Multi Value List, Check Box, and Multi Selection Button parameter types allow the  selection of multiple types. These parameter types return an array of values rather  than a single value. Data sources, including SQL, have special logic that maps the  array of values into the generated query.  Working with functions and expressions Pentaho Reporting provides many functions and expressions that may be used  during report creation. A function in Pentaho Reporting is used to calculate a  computed value. An expression in Pentaho Reporting is a function whose scope   is limited to the current dataset row. A function may maintain state, having access   to many rows of data.  All functions share the following properties:   	 Name: Used to reference the function or expression in elements, formulas,    	 Dependency Level: Used to determine the order in which to execute   and other functions     the functions  Listed below are the available functions and expressions, and how they are used.  Chart related functions were covered in depth within Chapter 6, so there is no need   to restate them in this list.

Formulas in Pentaho Reporting are based on the OpenFormula standard. This  standard is similar to Excel Formula support, and is used in Open Office, as well   as other tools such as Pentaho Metadata. This formula system is often referred to   as LibFormula, which is the library name for reporting's formula sub-project.  [ 198 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 7  Formula syntax A formula evaluates to a final value. Formulas support a standard set of data types,  along with operators and functions that may be used to derive new values. Here is   a simple example formula:  IF [COL1] > 10; "Big"; "Small" ;  This formula uses the IF function with parameters separated by semi-colons.  The first parameter is a comparison, resulting in true or false. To reference an outside  data column or named function, reference the column in brackets, as shown for COL1.  If the comparison example evaluates to true, the second parameter in the IF function  is returned. To specify a string, use double quotes, shown with "Big" and "Small".   If the statement evaluates to false, the third parameter is returned.  Also, the term NULL may be used to denote a null reference.  Formula data types Column data, as well as literal values, all get mapped to a formula data type. The  following data types are supported. Different types may inherit from one another:  Data Type Numeric  Description A Numeric value, represented in Java as a BigDecimal object.  Literal values of this type may take the following forms:  Text  Logical  Error   	  	  	  	  123 123.456 123e10 or 456E-10 -1.2  A text value, represented in Java as a String object. Literal  values of this type must be quoted with double quotes: "Text Here" To place a double quote within a string, reference it twice: " Here is a "" quote" The Logical type inherits from the Numeric type. The values of  this type are Boolean—either true or false. You may specify a  logical value through the functions TRUE   and FALSE  . Various formula functions may fail. When this occurs, an error  is created. Certain functions are available to determine if an  error has occurred.

Converts a Text string to a Numeric value.  As you can see, there are many functions to choose from when defining formulas  within reports. In Chapter 3, multiple formulas were used in examples to create rich,  dynamic reports.  Internationalization and localization   of reports To internationalize a report, you must use the resource elements available within  Pentaho Reporting when creating your report. Each resource element defines a  resource base and a resource key reference. Normally, the resource base refers to   the name of the message properties file in which localized names are kept. For  default handling of resource bundles in Java, please see Java's I18N Tutorial on  resource bundles:  [ 207 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Parameterization, Functions, Formulas, and Internationalization in Reports  http:  java.sun.com docs books tutorial i18n resbundle concept.html  Once you've built your report, you'll want to configure your application  to access the resource bundle files appropriately. Pentaho Reporting  defines a ResourceBundleFactory API, which allows you to customize  how these files are loaded.  By default, a report is configured to use the  DefaultResourceBundleFactory implementation, which uses Java's  ResourceBundle implementation. This implementation resolves the provided  resource base value on the Java classpath.    Another solution is to use the LibLoaderResourceBundleFactory, which uses  LibLoader's approach to loading files. LibLoader is an extendible framework for  loading resources. Utilizing LibLoader's default ResourceLoaders, you may load   data from the filesystem, URLs, ZIP files, as well as the classpath.  If neither of these implementations fits your needs, you may implement your own  ResourceBundleFactory. This factory interface defines the following methods:   	 public ResourceBundle getResourceBundle String key ;  	 public Locale getLocale  ;  If using a factory other than the default, you may specify the factory by calling  setResourceBundleFactory   on the master report object.  The ResouceBundleFactory is also responsible for determining the specific locale  to use when rendering the report. The DefaultResourceBundleFactory uses the  default system locale, but also contains a setLocale   method for configuring the  locale if necessary.  If you are not planning on implementing your own ResourceBundleFactory, the  recommended approach for configuring the locale of a report is to provide it through  the ReportEnvironment API.  The DefaultReportEnvironment class defines a  setLocale  method for configuring the report’s locale.  This is demonstrated in the  example below.  Localizing fields Using the resource-field element within your report allows you to localize dynamic  data to a certain extent. Instead of providing a static resource key, this element type  specifies the field data source where the key is generated from. The only limitation  to this approach is that you must have a defined bundle with the key to localized  mappings already in place. For a complete solution to dynamic localization, you   may want to investigate using the Indirect Lookup function, in order to  dynamically choose different localized columns in a database for populating a  specific dynamic field.

First, launch the  Pentaho Report Designer and create a very basic report with a resource-label in the  Report Header. Specify file:data localization-example as the resource-identifier,  and use localizedString as the value attribute. Export this report as localization- example.prpt, and place it in the data folder for Chapter 2.  You also need to create localized property files. For this example, create a default  English message bundle file as data localization-example.properties, with  the following text:  localizedString=My Localized Report  Create a Spanish message bundle file, localization-example_es.properties,  with the following text:  localizedString=Mi Informe Localizar   You'll now need to configure the Chapter2SwingApp, in order to use the new report,  along with the message bundles. First, edit the report reference to use file:data  localization-example.prpt. You'll now need to configure the report environment  with the correct locale.  Add the following lines of code right after creating the  MasterReport object:  Locale locale = Locale.getDefault  ;   DefaultReportEnvironment report.getReportEnvironment   . setLocale locale ;  Also, make sure to add the following imports:  import java.util.Locale; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core. DefaultReportEnvironment;  Run the example by typing ant run on the command line. You should see the label  "My Localized Report" appearing in the report.  Now change the creation of the Locale object to Spanish:  Locale locale = new Locale "es" ;  Execute ant run again. This time you should see the new Spanish label in your report.

You   also learned about the various ways to dynamically render a report, including  learning all the available functions and expressions, as well as learning the  LibFormula syntax and function list.  Finally, you learned how to internationalize  your reports and the static text within a report, so you can build reports that are  populated by internationalized data.

Sub-reports allow you to embed reusable reports  within a master report. As you'll see with the help of examples, sub-reports can take  on many forms—from multi-page detail reports to summary sub-reports that include  charts. You'll also learn how to create a side-by-side sub-report example. Along with  sub-reports, you'll learn how to incorporate cross tabs into your reports. Cross tabs  allow you to compare multiple variables in a single table of data values.  Adding sub-reports In Chapter 3, you created a very simple single data row sub-report that included  details about the current customer for invoicing purposes. In this chapter, you'll  review other scenarios for using sub-reports and learn the technical details involved  in including sub-reports in a master report.  Sub-reports in Pentaho Reporting may be included in any band of a report, except for  the page header and page footer bands. Sub-reports receive a DataRow of parameters,  determined by the current state of their parent report when rendering the sub-report.   These parameters may be used when executing a sub-report query or referenced  directly in the sub-report.  Within sub-reports, you define named queries that may  reference the DataRow of parameters passed in, allowing a sub-report to query only  the currently scoped data, not the entire data set available to the parent report.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Adding Sub-Reports and Cross Tabs to Reports  Sub-reports may be of any length, may be included in other sub-reports in a nested  fashion, and may also be presented side-by-side one another in their parent report.  When spanning multiple pages, special considerations must be made, including   how to handle the master report's page header, page footer, and group headers.   This chapter will cover all of these topics in the examples below.  Multi-page sub-report example In this first example, you'll build a report, which includes a large sub-report that may  span multiple pages. Before you can begin with these examples, you need to create  a new folder called chapter8, and copy the JAR files from the chapter3 lib folder  into chapter8 lib. Also, copy the chapter2 build.xml file into the chapter8  folder.  Finally, copy the chapter3 data folder to chapter8 data, so that you may  reuse the already configured ElectroBarn data source.  To begin with the example, you must first define your master report dataset. You'll  reuse the ElectroBarn HSQLDB example to build this report.  Launch the Report  Designer and create a new report. Add a new JDBC dataset. Select the already  defined ElectroBarn connection for this example, which was configured in Chapter 3.  Now, define the following query:  SELECT      "ENDOFDAY"."SESSIONID",      "ENDOFDAY"."EMPLOYEEID",      "ENDOFDAY"."ACTUALCHECKTOTAL",      "ENDOFDAY"."ACTUALCASHTOTAL",      "ENDOFDAY"."CHECKOUTTIME" FROM      "ENDOFDAY" ORDER BY      "ENDOFDAY"."SESSIONID" ASC  This simple query selects the high level sales clerk session information. Now that  you've configured your dataset, it's time to define your master report. First, create   an example page header and footer. Place a label in the Page Header and add the  text Master Report Page Header. For the Page Footer, place a label and set the  text to Master Report Page Footer. For both the header and the footer, check the  sticky style attribute checkbox, which appears in the page behavior group of style  attributes. This tells the reporting engine to render the master report's page header  and footer on pages generated by the sub-report. Otherwise, these bands would not  appear in every page of the generated report. Finish the master report by dragging and dropping the fields for SESSIONID and  EMPLOYEEID in the Details band. Give both of these fields a label as well. Your  report should look like the following:  [ 212 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 8  It's now time to add a sub-report to the master report. Drag-and-drop a sub-report   element from the Palette into the Details band, below the Employee ID. When  prompted, select the Banded option for this sub-report. Banded sub-reports act as  an independent band within the report and take up the entire width. A Banded   sub-report must appear below all other elements within a band. Therefore, if you  add additional elements, the sub-report will appear below those added elements.  Now, you're ready to begin editing the sub-report. Double-click on the sub-report  element, or right-click and select the Edit sub-report menu option, in order to bring  up the sub-report for editing.  The first step to setting up the sub-report is to create a new data source query.   Create the following ElectroBarn query as part of the sub-report:  SELECT      "PURCHASES"."SESSIONID",      "PURCHASES"."PAYMENTTYPE",      "PURCHASES"."PURCHASETIME",      "PURCHASES"."PURCHASEID",      "PURCHASEITEMS"."QUANTITY",      "INVENTORY"."SALEPRICE",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMNAME" FROM      "PURCHASEITEMS" INNER JOIN "INVENTORY" ON  "PURCHASEITEMS"."ITEMID" = "INVENTORY"."ITEMID"      INNER JOIN "PURCHASES" ON "PURCHASEITEMS"."PURCHASEID" =  "PURCHASES"."PURCHASEID" WHERE       "PURCHASES"."SESSIONID" = ${SESSIONID} ORDER BY      "PURCHASES"."PURCHASEID" ASC  [ 213 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Adding Sub-Reports and Cross Tabs to Reports  This query selects details for the current SESSIONID, and is used by this and  subsequent sub-report examples. Now, you must customize the parameters that are  available to the sub-report.  You can do this by bringing up the sub-report parameters  dialog. Right-click on the sub-report's Parameters tree item under the Data tab and  select the Edit Sub-report Parameters... menu item. The following dialog will appear:  This example limits the visible fields to the SESSIONID. Click the add import  parameter button, and edit the table row by typing SESSIONID for both the  Outer Name and Inner Name, as displayed above.   The Outer Name defines the name of the field within the master report, and the  Inner Name defines the name as seen by the sub-report. In addition to importing  parameters into a sub-report, sub-reports may make parameters available by  exporting them to the master report.  You're now ready to style the sub-report. In this sub-report, you'll show the  individual sales details with summaries about each sale. To begin, add a label  element, Sub-Report Page Header, to the sub-report's Page Header. Also, add  a label, Sub-Report Page Footer, to the Page Footer.   Second, populate the Details band of the sub-report. Drag-and-drop the field for  the ITEMNAME, as well as for the SALEPRICE and QUANTITY. Also, add an  Open Formula function that multiplies SALEPRICE by QUANTITY, and call  this ITEMPRICE.  =[SALEPRICE]*[QUANTITY]  Add ITEMPRICE to the Details band by dragging and dropping the function  into the canvas.  To complete the details band, you'll want to band the detail rows with different  colors.  Select the Details band in the structure tree and name it details. Now,  create a Row Banding Function, which appears in the Report functions group of  functions. Set the Apply Element s  Named property to details, along with setting  the Active Banding Color and Inactive Banding Color properties to alternating  shades of white and green. The design view of the sub-report Details band should  look like this:    [ 214 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 8  Now, add some summary information to the sub-report. Right-click on the Groups  tree and edit the root group, naming it purchaseid and adding the group field  PURCHASEID. Unselect the hide-on-canvas attribute for the Group Header and  Group Footer bands.  Drag-and-drop the PURCHASEID and PURCHASETIME  fields into the Group Header, along with adding a rectangle background to  distinguish this from other parts of the report. Also, add header columns for the  Details band.  Create a Sum function called TotalSale, which sums the ITEMPRICE formula  defined earlier. Set the Group Name property to purchaseid, which is the name  of the group defined earlier. Drag-and-drop the TotalSale function into the far right of the report's Group Footer,  along with some additional color, in order for the report to look nice.  You're now ready to preview the report to see how the sub-report looks when  combined with the master report. Notice that when you preview the sub-report,  it also renders the master report. Also notice that when the sub-report renders, the master report's Page Header  and Page Footer appear alongside the sub-report's Page Header and Page Footer.  Experiment by unselecting the sticky style attribute on the Page Header and Page  Footer of the master report, and preview to see that the header and footer do not  appear. Save the report as chapter8 data subreport_multipage.prpt. The  sub-report definition is stored as part of the report bundle, so no additional files   are necessary for storage.  To complete this example, copy the chapter2 src Chapter2SwingApp.java file  into the chapter8 src folder and rename the class to MultipageSubreportApp. java, creating a simple Java application to demonstrate the sub-report. Update the  Java application to reference your new report.  Resource res = manager.createDirectly     new URL "file:data subreport_multipage.prpt" , MasterReport.class ;  [ 215 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Adding Sub-Reports and Cross Tabs to Reports  Now that you've updated the report definition, you're ready to run the example  application. Add the following Ant target to your build.xml file:  <java fork="true" classpathref="runtime_classpath" classname="Mult       ipageSubreportApp" >     Type ant runmultipagesubreport to preview the report, which should look  something like this:  [ 216 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 8  Chart sub-report example In addition to embedding traditional reports into a master report, sub-reports  are also useful for embedding summary or detailed information not available in  the initial data source query of a master report. In this example, you'll reuse your  previously defined master report, and instead of showing a multi-page sub-report,  you'll display a pie chart summarizing the information.  Open the already defined subreport_multipage.prpt file. Delete the already  defined sub-report element and place a new Inline sub-report element in its place.  Double-click on the sub-report element to launch the sub-report view. Define a new  data source query for the sub-report by re-using the sub-report query defined earlier.  Make sure to define SESSIONID as a sub-report input parameter. Now that you've defined the sub-report query, place a chart element in the report  header of the sub-report. Select the Pie chart type. Edit the chart element by setting  the value-column property to QUANTITY and the series-by-field property  to PURCHASEID.  Save this report as chapter8 data subreport_chart.prpt.

The example below  demonstrates this functionality by taking the charting example defined previously,  and adding a summary table next to the pie chart for each session.  Open up the subreport_chart.prpt, and add a sub-report element next to the  chart sub-report:  Double-click on the new sub-report to begin editing. You'll use the same data source  query as the chart for this sub-report, so define a new JDBC query with the copied  SQL.  You will also need to define SESSIONID as an input parameter to the sub-report.    In this sub-report, you'll want to define a simple summary of each purchase. As in  the first sub-report example, define a group with PURCHASEID as its field. Make  the group's header visible in the report. Also, define the ITEMPRICE and TotalSale  functions as defined in the first example. Drag-and-drop the PURCHASEID and PURCHASETIME fields, along with the  TotalSale function, into the Group Header. In the Report Header, add the column  headers. Finally, add a rectangle to the group header named GroupBackground,  and add the following visible style formula to toggle the rectangle's visibility:  =IF  ISODD  [PURCHASEID]  ; TRUE  ; FALSE      Toggling the colors acts as a row banding mechanism. The row banding function  used earlier works only on the Details band, hence the special formula expression. The report design should look something like this:  Preview the master report to see side-by-side sub-reports in action. Now,  save this report as chapter8 data subreport_sidebyside.prpt. Copy  the MultipageSubreportApp.java example class to chapter8 src  SideBySideSubReportApp.java. Update the class with the new report filename.

Using cross tabs, you can  easily view two or more fields and how they relate based on a measure. For instance,  you may want to see how much sales each sales person is doing during the course  of a week, and a cross tab allows you to present that data easily, as shown in the  following table:  Chapter 8  Day 1 Day 2  Sales Person 1 $1,240 $1,400  Sales Person 2 $1,100 $1,000  Pentaho Reporting offers the ability to create cross tab-based reports. These are  a special type of report that render differently than most standard reports. These  reports also expect the data to be in a particular format. Traditionally, cross tab  reports are driven by multidimensional queries. As highlighted in Chapter 5,  Pentaho Reporting offers a Mondrian and olap4j DataFactory for providing  multidimensional data to a report. Use the DenormalizedMDXDataFactory to  populate a cross tab report. This Data Factory flattens out an MDX result set.   The following MDX query:  select       [Employee].Members on rows,       [Time].[All Times].Children on columns  from       [Sales]  where       [Measures].[Total Sales]  would result in the dataset as shown in the following table:  Employee  All   Employee Name  Time  All  Time Sale   All Employees All Employees All Employees All Employees All Employees All Employees  — —  Sales Person 1 Sales Person 1 Sales Person 2 Sales person 2  All Times All Times All Times All Times All Times All Times  Day Day 1 Day 2 Day 1 Day 2 Day 1 Day 2  Total  Sales $2,340 $2,400 $1,240 $1,400 $1,100 $1,000  Note that the first two rows are the summation of all the employee sales for the   first two days.    [ 221 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Adding Sub-Reports and Cross Tabs to Reports  Pentaho Reporting uses this dataset to populate a cross tab. First, you would   define the measure in the Details band of the cross tab. You would then define   the Employee dimension as the cross tab column group. Finally, you would   define the Time dimension as the cross tab row group.  In MDX, it is possible to select multiple dimensions on the same axis. For each  dimension defined on an axis, you may add an additional cross tab row or cross   tab column group.  It is also possible to generate the same type of result set with standard SQL.   Here is the same data selected as SQL instead of MDX:  SELECT      'All Employees' AS ALLEMPLOYEES,      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE",      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY",      SUM "SALES_FACT"."SALEPRICE"  AS TOTAL_SALES FROM      "SALES_FACT" GROUP BY      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE",      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY" ORDER BY      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE" ASC,      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY" ASC  Note that this query doesn't sum the values at the All Employees level. Grouping  sets, an advanced SQL concept, would need to be used to make that possible.    Cross tabs may contain multiple rows and columns. For instance, if you placed both  the Employee and Time dimensions in the row group of your cross tab, the results  would look identical to the flattened result set displayed above.  Cross tab MDX example For this example, you'll need a simple Mondrian cube to work with. First define a  quick fact table in HSQLDB, along with defining a Mondrian schema that maps to  the table.  You'll use the example above as the fact table. Add the following DDL to  the electrobarn.script file, which is located in the chapter8 data folder:  CREATE TEXT TABLE SALES_FACT  EMPLOYEE VARCHAR,SALEDAY  VARCHAR,SALETIME VARCHAR, SALEPRICE DOUBLE  SET TABLE INVENTORY SOURCE "salesfact.csv;ignore_first=true"  [ 222 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   The salesfact.csv file, along with the electrobarn.script file,  are provided as part of this book, or you can also download them online at:   http:  www.packtpub.com files code 3193_Code.zip   You also need to define the Mondrian Schema. Save the following Mondrian Schema  XML in your chapter8 data folder as electrobarn.mondrian.xml:  Chapter 8                         column="EMPLOYEE" >                   aggregator="sum" >                                          <Level name="Employee Name"                      <Measure name="Total Sales" column="SALEPRICE"                 This schema defines the Cube, Dimensions, and Measure discussed earlier.  Now, it's time to build the report in Pentaho Report Designer. To begin, you'll define  a Denormalized MDX data source, based on the Sales cube as defined above. Click  the Data tab, right-click on the Data Sets tree item and select OLAP  Mondrian   Denormalized . Select the predefined ElectroBarn HSQLDB Data Source. Edit this  data source to point to chapter8 data electrobarn, which contains the recently  added SALES_FACT table. Now, select the recently saved electrobarn.mondrian. xml as the Mondrian Schema File. Define the following MDX Query as part of your Mondrian data set:  select [Employee].Members on rows, [Time].[All Times].Children on  columns from [Sales] where [Measures].[Total Sales]  This query selects all values from the Employee dimension on rows, and all the  members of the first level of the Time dimension on columns. Once the MDX data  source is defined, you're ready to build the cross tab report.

This  adds a new Add Crosstab Group menu option to the Master Report tree element. To begin, right-click on the Master Report tree element and select Add Crosstab  Group.  This replaces the traditional group hierarchy in the tree with a cross tab  group hierarchy, and also changes the canvas view as shown below:  The cross tab report hierarchy consists of cross tab rows, cross tab columns, and  finally a details body. You may add additional cross tab rows by right-clicking on   the crosstab-row-group and selecting Add Crosstab Row Group. You can add cross  tab columns by right-clicking on the crosstab-column group and selecting Add  Crosstab Column Group. The next step is to configure the rows of the cross tab. Click on the crosstab-row- group, and set the group attribute to [Employee].[ All ]. In the Group Header  tree element within the crosstab-row-group, right-click and select Add Element   string-field. Set the field attribute of the string-field to [Employee].[ All ]. Also,  define an empty label in the title-header. The empty label is used for correct column  header spacing. This defines the first row group in the cross tab.

Right-click on the crosstab-row-group and select Add Crosstab Row Group. For  this row group, set the group attribute to [Employee].[Employee Name]. In the  Group Header tree element within the crosstab-row-group, right-click and select  Add Element  string-field. Set the field attribute of the string-field to [Employee]. [Employee Name]. Also, define an empty label in the title-header. The empty label  is used for correct column header spacing. This defines the second row group in the  cross tab. Now that you've defined the two necessary row groups, click on the  crosstab-column-group and set the group attribute to [Time].[Sale Day].  In the Group Header tree element within the crosstab-row-group, right-click  and select Add Element  string-field. Set the field attribute of the string-field to  [Employee].[Employee Name]. This defines the column group in the cross tab. To complete the cross tab, add a number-field to the Details tree element, and select  [Measures].[Total Sales] for the field attribute. You may choose to customize  the text-field and number-field fonts and styles. Here is the final view of the tree  when you've completed, with the Details number-field selected:  [ 225 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Adding Sub-Reports and Cross Tabs to Reports  The canvas within Report Designer at this point looks like the following:  [ 226 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 8  Once you've built and previewed the report in Report Designer, you'll need to save  the report as chapter8 data mdxcrosstab.prpt and create a Java application to  render the report. Update the report reference section of the onPreview   method,  within a freshly copied Chapter2SwingApp, renamed to MdxCrossTabApp.  Resource res = manager.createDirectly        new URL "file:data mdxcrosstab.prpt" , MasterReport.class ;  You will also need to copy the necessary Mondrian DataFactory JAR files into the  chapter8 lib folder. Copy the following JAR files from the Report Designer's  lib folder:   	 commons-collections.jar  	 commons-dbcp.jar  	 commons-math.jar  	 commons-pool.jar  	 commons-vfs.jar  	 eigenbase-resgen.jar  	 eigenbase-xom.jar  	 eigenbase-properties.jar  	 javacup.jar  	 log4j.jar  	 mondrian.jar  	 pentaho-reporting-engine-classic-extensions-mondrian.jar  Finally, you'll need to add the following Ant target to the build.xml file:  <java fork="true" classpathref="runtime_classpath" classname="MdxC       rossTabApp" >     Type ant runmdxcrosstab on the command line to view the results!

Open up the mdxcrosstab.xml file in Report  Designer and save it as sqlcrosstab.xml.You're now ready to modify the data  source to use a SQL query. Delete the denormalized MDX data source and create   a new JDBC data source.  Now, you need to provide the cross tab SQL statement. The following SQL statement  returns nearly identical results to that of the MDX query generated earlier:  SELECT      'All Employees' AS ALLEMPLOYEES,      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE",      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY",      SUM "SALES_FACT"."SALEPRICE"  AS TOTAL_SALES FROM      "SALES_FACT" GROUP BY      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE",      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY" ORDER BY      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE" ASC,      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY" ASC  You'll need to update the cross tab report to reflect the new field names. Change the  report element fields [Employee].[ All ] to ALLEMPLOYEES, [Employee].[Employee  Name] to EMPLOYEE,  [Time].[Sale Day] to SALEDAY, and [Measures].[Total Sales]  to TOTAL_SALES.  Also, make sure to update the crosstab-row-group and crosstab- column-group group attributes. You're now ready to preview the cross tab example.  The result should look similar to the previous MDX-based example, except for  displaying the total for all employees.  All Employees All Employees  Sales Person 1 Sales Person 2  Day 1  $1,240.00 $1,100.00  Day 2  $1,400.00 $1,000.00  As you can see from this example, a cross tab report can be driven by both  denormalized MDX data, as well as SQL data, given that they return similar result  sets. Save the SQL cross tab report as sqlcrosstab.prpt. You’ll be using it in the  next example.  [ 228 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Multiple row and column cross tab example In this example, you'll update the SQL example with an additional measure, and  display both total sales and average sales in the cross tab. Open the sqlcrosstab. prpt file in Pentaho Report Designer.  Update the SQL data source query to include the average sale price:  Chapter 8  SELECT      'All Employees' AS ALLEMPLOYEES,      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE",      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY",      SUM "SALES_FACT"."SALEPRICE"  AS TOTAL_SALES,      AVG "SALES_FACT"."SALEPRICE"  AS AVERAGE_SALES FROM      "SALES_FACT" GROUP BY      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE",      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY" ORDER BY      "SALES_FACT"."EMPLOYEE" ASC,      "SALES_FACT"."SALEDAY" ASC  You'll now update the cross tab with the necessary report elements, in order to  display the average sale, along with labels for the measures. Right-click on the  Details band in the tree view and select Add Element  number-field. Select  AVERAGE_SALES as the field value, and set the format to $,0.0. Because it's not  possible to move the report element in the canvas, you'll need to update the size  and location attributes to render the cross tab cell correctly. For this element, set the  width style attribute to 60.0, and set the x style attribute to 60.0. This places it after  the Total Sales number-field. Also, select the Total Sales number-field and set it's  width to 60.0 as well. You'll also need to update the column header. Select the SALEDAY string-field  defined in the crosstab-column-group Group Header, and set the width to 120.0.  This keeps the column header width in sync with the details body. Now, right-click  on the same Group Header and add two labels. The first label should be given the  value Total Sale and should have a width of 60.0. It also needs a y value of 20.0.  Add a second label with the value Average Sale, and give this label a width of  60.0, along with an x value of 60.0 and y value of 20.0.

Your report should look something like this:  All Employees All Employees  Sales Person 1 Sales Person 2  Day 1 Total Sales $1,240.00 $1,100.00  $206.67 $183.33  Day 2 Total Sales $1,400.00 $1,000.00  $233.33 $166.67  Average Sales  Average Sales  Summary In this chapter, you built from scratch examples of sub-reports and cross tabs,  exploring the capabilities offered by Pentaho Reporting. You built a multi-page   sub-report, which demonstrated the use of the sticky flag available for managing  page headers. You also built a sub-report with a summary chart. You then extended  that example as a side-by-side sub-report with a summary chart, as well as a  summary table of data retrieved from a different data query than the master report.  You also built cross tab reports based on MDX and SQL queries. These cross tab  reports contained multiple row and column headers, and displayed summary data  regarding ElectroBarn's sales numbers across multiple days.

Interactive reports are less common, but allow for interesting behaviors within various  output formats. Each type of interactive approach covered in this chapter is based on  the particular layout engine. You'll learn about Swing and HTML interactive options  by creating examples that demonstrate their capabilities. By definition, interactive  reports are based on events. Event bindings are defined in the report definition,  making it possible to receive event notifications from within a report.  Interactive reports in Swing In earlier chapters, you learned how to generate a static preview of a report within  Swing via Pentaho Reporting's PreviewDialog API. This API also allows you to  register action, hyperlink, and mouse events, so you can enable interactive reporting  within Swing.  Registering event callbacks The three Java interfaces for retrieving event callbacks from within a report are  ReportHyperlinkListener, ReportActionListener, and ReportMouseListener.  The ReportHyperlinkListener and ReportActionListener require special  properties defined in your report definition, while the ReportMouseListener is  a lower level event that is always called within the report PreviewDialog.  ReportHyperlinkListener The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.gui.base.event. ReportHyperlinkListener interface defines the following API callback method:  void hyperlinkActivated ReportHyperlinkEvent event ;  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Building Interactive Reports  This method is called whenever someone clicks on an element within a report  that has defined the link url style attribute. The ReportHyperlinkEvent provides  additional metadata about the click, including the source node in the report, the  hyperlink target definition, as well as the window and title hyperlink definition:     The PreviewPane object public Object getSource  ;      The reporting node object public RenderNode getSourceNode  ;      The defined style attribute url public String getTarget  ;     The defined style attribute window public String getWindow  ;      The defined style attribute title public String getTitle  ;  ReportHyperlinkListener implementations are registered by calling  PreviewPane.addReportHyperlinkListener listener . The PreviewPane  object is accessible after defining a PreviewDialog by calling PreviewDialog. getPreviewPane  .  One use case for implementing ReportHyperlinkListener is to allow report  linking from one high level report to more detailed reports within a Java application.  Hyperlinks may appear differently when rendering in HTML  and Swing. Make sure to preview your report to verify that it  renders correctly.  ReportActionListener In addition to receiving ReportHyperlinkListener events, the Swing  PreviewDialog may also receive special events triggered only in the Swing  environment. This is done by specifying the swing action attribute on an element.  The swing action attribute type is a string. When an element within a report defines  the action attribute, and a user clicks on that element, an event is fired and all  registered ReportActionListener instances receive an event notification with  the specified swing action attribute value.  The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.gui.base.event. ReportActionListener interface defines the following API callback method:  public void reportActionPerformed final ReportActionEvent event ;  [ 232 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   The ReportActionEvent object returned in the callback provides the  following information:  Chapter 9     The PreviewPane object public Object getSource  ;     The reporting node object public RenderNode getNode  ;      The action parameter specified in the report. public Object getActionParameter  ;  To register a ReportActionListener, you must call PreviewDrawablePanel.addRe portActionListener listener . The PreviewDrawablePanel is accessible via the  PreviewPane.getReportPreviewArea   API call.  ReportMouseListener The org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.gui.base.event. ReportMouseListener interface provides the following callbacks:  public void reportMouseClicked ReportMouseEvent event ; public void reportMousePressed ReportMouseEvent event ; public void reportMouseReleased ReportMouseEvent event ;  These are triggered when a user has clicked, pressed, or released their mouse within  a report. Each listener registered is called for every element found at the specific X,  Y location within the report. If there are two or more elements overlapping, multiple  event calls will be made, one for each of the report elements. The ReportMouseEvent  provides the following information when a callback occurs:     The PreviewPane object public Object getSource  ;     The reporting node object public RenderNode getSourceNode  ;     The original java.awt.event.MouseEvent public MouseEvent getSourceEvent  ;   To register a ReportMouseListener, you must call PreviewDrawablePanel.addRe portMouseListener listener . The PreviewDrawablePanel is accessible via the  PreviewPane.getReportPreviewArea   API call.

The PageDrawable API defines the following methods:     Retrieves ReportNodes based on x and y location.    A namespace and name filter may be applied to only    retrieve nodes that define a certain attribute. public RenderNode[] getNodesAt  final double x,  final double y, final String namespace, final String name ;     Retrieves nodes within a window, starting at an x,y    location and stretching out to the defined pixel width     and height.  A namespace and name filter may be applied     to only retrieve nodes that define a certain attribute.  public RenderNode[] getNodesAt  final double x,     final double y, final double width, final double height,    final String namespace, final String name ;   The PageDrawable object is accessible via the PreviewDrawablePanel. getPageDrawable   API call.  Interactive Swing example In this example, you'll combine the three listener interfaces into a simple report that  demonstrates the various callbacks. To begin, you need to set up your environment.  First, you need to create a new folder called chapter9, and copy over the JAR files  from the chapter3 lib folder into chapter9 lib.  Also, copy the chapter3 data  folder to chapter9 data so that you may reuse the already configured ElectroBarn  data source.  Finally, copy the chapter3 build.xml file into the chapter9 folder so  that you can build the example.  You'll reuse the Chapter2SwingApp class from Chapter 2 as a shell to build  from. Copy chapter2 src Chapter2SwingApp.java to chapter9 src  Chapter9SwingApp.java, and rename the class to Chapter9SwingApp.  Now that you've created the Chapter9SwingApp class, you're ready to begin  designing the report, along with adding the various Swing event listeners to your  Swing PreviewDialog. Launch Pentaho Report Designer and create a new report.  For the master report, define the following ElectroBarn SQL query, which you used  in Chapter 8:  SELECT      "ENDOFDAY"."SESSIONID",      "ENDOFDAY"."EMPLOYEEID",      "ENDOFDAY"."ACTUALCHECKTOTAL",  [ 234 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 9       "ENDOFDAY"."ACTUALCASHTOTAL",      "ENDOFDAY"."CHECKOUTTIME" FROM      "ENDOFDAY" ORDER BY      "ENDOFDAY"."SESSIONID" ASC  In the Details band of the master report, place two labels with the text Session  ID and Employee ID, along with dragging and dropping the SESSIONID and  EMPLOYEEID fields into the band. For the SESSIONID field, also specify the  following formula for the Swing action attribute:  =[SESSIONID]  Later in this example, you'll register a ReportActionListener, which will receive  the SESSIONID as an input parameter, when clicked on the SESSIONID field.   Also, enable row banding by adding a background rectangle and setting its visible  style formula to the following:  =IF ISODD [SESSIONID] ;TRUE  ;FALSE     Now, place an inline sub-report element below the content within the Details band.  Set the sub-report visible style attribute to the following formula:  =AND NOT ISNA [REPORT_PARAM_SESSIONID]  ; [SESSIONID] = [REPORT_PARAM_ SESSIONID]   This will evaluate to true if the parameter REPORT_PARAM_SESSIONID matches the  currently selected session. This parameter will be passed into the report when a user  clicks on the SESSIONID field.   The Details band of the master report should look similar to this:  You're now ready to begin editing the sub-report. Double-click on the sub-report  element or right-click and select the Edit sub-report menu option to bring up the  sub-report for editing.

Create the following ElectroBarn SQL query as part of the sub-report:  SELECT      "PURCHASES"."SESSIONID",      "PURCHASES"."PAYMENTTYPE",      "PURCHASES"."PURCHASETIME",      "PURCHASES"."PURCHASEID",      "PURCHASEITEMS"."QUANTITY",      "INVENTORY"."SALEPRICE",      "INVENTORY"."ITEMNAME" FROM      "PURCHASEITEMS" INNER JOIN "INVENTORY" ON  "PURCHASEITEMS"."ITEMID" = "INVENTORY"."ITEMID"      INNER JOIN "PURCHASES" ON "PURCHASEITEMS"."PURCHASEID" =  "PURCHASES"."PURCHASEID" WHERE       "PURCHASES"."SESSIONID" = ${SESSIONID} ORDER BY      "PURCHASES"."PURCHASEID" ASC  This query selects details only for the current SESSIONID. You must customize the  parameters that are available to the sub-report. You can do this by bringing up the  Sub-report Parameters dialog by right-clicking on the sub-report's Parameters tree  item under the Data tab and selecting the Edit Sub-report Parameters… menu item.  The following dialog will appear:  Now that you've defined the sub-report query, place a chart element in the report  header of the sub-report. Select the Pie chart type. Edit the chart element, setting the  value-column to QUANTITY and the series-by-field to PURCHASEID.

Set the name attribute of the  rectangles to Action1 and Action2—the names of the rectangles will be used by a  ReportMouseListener later in this example. Also, add a label below the rectangles  titled Google Reference. Set the url style formula of this label to a Google query,  which will search for the first item in the dataset:  ="http:  www.google.com search?q=" & [ITEMNAME]  The & symbol concatenates the ITEMNAME to the end of the query string. You'll  use this label to demonstrate the ReportHyperlinkListener. The sub-report should  look similar to this:  Save the master report as chapter9 data interactive_swing.prpt. You're now  ready to update the Chapter9SwingApp class with event listeners.  [ 237 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Building Interactive Reports  First, update the example to render the interactive_swing.prpt report in a  separate method:  ResourceManager manager = new ResourceManager  ; manager.registerDefaults  ; Resource res = manager.createDirectly                 new URL "file:data interactive_swing.prpt" ,    public MasterReport createReport   throws IOException,  ResourceException {                                    MasterReport.class ;     }  MasterReport report =  MasterReport  res.getResource  ;  return report;     Replace the loading of the report in the onPreview method with the following code:  MasterReport report = createReport  ;  Now, you'll define three event listeners. The first event listener to be added is a  ReportActionListener. This listener will re-render the report, displaying the  details of the clicked selection. You must first set up a mechanism to pass the   current Session ID. Define a class member of type String called sessionId:  Integer sessionId = null;  Add the following code at the end of the createReport method, which sets the  sessionId as an input parameter if it's available:  if  sessionId != null  { report.getParameterValues  .put "REPORT_PARAM_SESSIONID", sessionId ; }  Now, add the following code right after the preview.addWindowListener   call:  preview.getPreviewPane  .getReportPreviewArea  . addReportActionListener new ReportActionListener   {  Integer newSessionId =   Number event.getActionParameter   .   public void reportActionPerformed ReportActionEvent event  {                                           intValue  ;                  if  !newSessionId.equals sessionId   {                sessionId = newSessionId;  SwingUtilities.invokeLater new Runnable   {            public void run   {          try {   preview.setReportJob createReport   ; } catch  Exception e  {   e.printStackTrace  ;                   [ 238 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 9  }    }      } ;        }          }            } ;  Note that this example uses SwingUtilities to update the report once the current  event processing is complete.  The second listener to be added is the hyperlink listener. This listener will display a  message dialog. In a real application, this might launch a browser window. Add   the following code after the previously defined report action listener:  preview.getPreviewPane  .addReportHyperlinkListener new     ReportHyperlinkListener   {     public void hyperlinkActivated final ReportHyperlinkEvent event       {        SwingUtilities.invokeLater new Runnable           {public void run   {JOptionPane.showMessageDialog null,                              "Link Clicked: " + event.getTarget   ;}          } ;      }     } ;  The final listener will determine which rectangle was clicked.  preview.getPreviewPane  .getReportPreviewArea  .addReportMouseListener  new ReportMouseListener   {   public void reportMouseClicked ReportMouseEvent event  {     if  event.getSourceNode   !=         null && event.getSourceNode  .getName  .equals "Action1"   {       } else if  event.getSourceNode   !=          null && event.getSourceNode  .getName  .equals "Action2"   {       }   }  JOptionPane.showMessageDialog null, "Action 1 Rectangle Clicked" ;  JOptionPane.showMessageDialog null, "Action 2 Rectangle Clicked" ;    public void reportMousePressed ReportMouseEvent event  {}    public void reportMouseReleased ReportMouseEvent event  {} } ;  Remember, the mouse listener is called for every element that you clicked on. In this  case, you may have clicked on the label and the rectangle, a scenario which would  result in the event handler being called twice.

Interactive reports in HTML In addition to defining interactive reports in Swing, it is also possible to define  highly customized interactive reports within the HTML JavaScript environment.  Pentaho Reporting defines a set of properties, which when specified, allow for rich  interactivity between the user and a report. In this section, you will get an overview  of these properties, along with a rich example that demonstrates potential uses.  Interactive HTML report properties All reporting elements share a common set of HTML-related properties that may   be used to create a dynamic report. Below is a list of properties and their uses:  HTML Properties class  name  title  xml-id  append-body  append-body-footer  append-header  This property sets the class attribute of the current HTML entity  to the specified value. This property sets the name attribute of the current HTML entity  to the specified value. This property sets the title attribute of the current HTML entity to  the specified value. This property allows the naming of the current HTML entity,  setting the id attribute, making it possible to reference in outside  scripts. This property allows the placement of raw HTML within the  body of the HTML document, prior to the rendering of the  current element. This property allows the placement of raw HTML within the  body of the HTML document, after the rendering of the current  element. Defined only at the master report level, this property allows  the inclusion of raw HTML within the header of the HTML  document generated. This location is traditionally used to load  additional CSS files, as well as external JavaScript files.

This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  clicks on the element. This property renders an ondblclick HTML attribute on  the currently defined element. This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  double-clicks on the element. This property renders an onmousedown HTML attribute on  the currently defined element. This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  presses a mouse button. This might be used to detect the  beginning of a drag operation. This property renders an onmouseup HTML attribute on  the currently defined element. This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  releases a mouse button. This property renders an onmousemove HTML attribute on  the currently defined element. This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  moves the mouse. This property renders an onmouseover HTML attribute on  the currently defined element. This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  moves the mouse over the element. This property renders an onkeydown HTML attribute on  the currently defined element. This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  presses a key down. This property renders an onkeypressed HTML attribute  on the currently defined element. This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  presses a key. This property renders an onkeyup HTML attribute on  the currently defined element. This property is a string of  JavaScript that is executed within the browser when a user  releases a key.

For instance, by setting a label's  xml-id to example, and setting the following JavaScript in the on-click property,  you can toggle between two text values:  document.getElementById 'example' .innerHTML=  document.getElementById  'example' .innerHTML == 'Hello'  ? 'Goodbye' : 'Hello';  Including an external CSS or JavaScript  resource Using the master report object's append-header property, it is possible to include  CSS or JavaScript in your report. This is useful if you have written a large amount of  JavaScript that you would like to keep separate from your report, or if you want to  include a useful JavaScript library, as demonstrated in the example that will follow.  An example of the append-header value might be:     When implementing the server, it's important to make sure that the relative path   of the files referenced are accessible from the current document.  Interactive HTML example As a demonstration of how an interactive report might work, this example walks you  through building a dashboard that includes rendering an HTML report with filters  and charts, with the ability to view the result in PDF format.    To begin, you'll need to create a standard report. Note that the master report in this  example does not require a query. You'll populate only the Report Header with two  sub-reports.  First, add a label to the Report Header entitled Session ID, and add  a text field that references the SESSIONID input parameter. Note that you do not  need to define the input parameter in Report Designer, as this will be managed by  the web application. You'll now add two sub-reports to the Report Header. Place  two sub-report objects within the report header below the session information. The  result should look like this:  [ 243 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Building Interactive Reports  You'll reuse the chart and summary sub-report definitions defined in Chapter 8 as  part of the side-by-side sub-report example. Follow the instructions in Chapter 8   for populating these sub-reports.    Also, you must create two identical master reports with the same content and query  as the sub-reports. Save these master reports as chapter9 data subreport_chart. prpt and chapter9 data subreport_summary.prpt.  When complete, the chart sub-report should look like this:  And the summary sub-report should look like this:  When this dashboard example is complete, the sub-reports will be executed in two  different manners. The first is rendered as a sub-report in the master report. The  second is an independent report, which will be executed via a call from the browser  and embedded within the existing report for dynamic updating. Save your report as  chapter9 data dashboard.prpt.  Now that you've defined the basic report without interactive capabilities, you'll set  up the server as well. Copy the chapter3 src Chapter3Servlet.java example  to DashboardServlet.java in the chapter9 src folder. Rename the class to  DashboardServlet. Also, copy chapter3 war WEB-INF web.xml to chapter9  war WEB-INF web.xml. Open the web.xml file and change all references of  Chapter3Servlet to DashboardServlet.  The new DashboardServlet requires the HTTP parameter reportName to be passed  so that the correct report is rendered. The two changes you'll need to make include  updating the Servlet to render reports as HTML, and to pass in the sessionId as  a report input parameter. First, you'll need to update the Session ID input parameter.  Update the getParameterValues  .put   call to pass the sessionId as SESSIONID:  [ 244 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 9  report.getParameterValues  .put "SESSIONID", sessionId ;  For the second modification, HTML documents require additional code to render,  as external files such as CSS, and images, must be cached and available over HTTP  after the report has already been generated. First, add a member variable of type   int called reportNum:  int reportNum = 0;  Now, after the Excel rendering code, add the following lines of code:  String reportLoc = "report_" + reportNum++; String path = this.getServletContext  .getRealPath reportLoc ; File folder = new File path ; folder.mkdir  ; HtmlReportUtil.createDirectoryHTML report,    } else if  "html".equals outputFormat   {                                           path + File.separator + "index.html" ;    response.sendRedirect reportLoc + " index.html" ;  Note that this code creates a new folder with CSS, HTML, and images for every  request made to the server. In a production environment, these files would be hosted  temporarily while the report loaded, and then cleaned out automatically. Make sure  to add the following imports to complete the code changes:  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table. html.HtmlReportUtil;  You'll now create the chapter9 war index.html file with links to the three  regular reports:       Interactive Dashboard Example   This is an example application demonstrating how to create an html  based interactive report.              Master Report    <a href="report?reportName=subreport_chart&outputFormat=html&sessionId           =1">Chart Report   <a href="report?reportName=subreport_summary&outputFormat=html&session           Id=1">Summary Report       [ 245 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Building Interactive Reports  You're now ready to test the base set of reports, which you'll use for the interactive  example. First, update the build.xml to build a chapter9 war folder vs. the  chapter2 war folder. Now, type ant war, along with ant start_tomcat, and visit  http:  localhost:8080 chapter9 in your web browser to view the three reports.  The first is the master report.  The second is the chart report.  Finally, the last one is the summary report.  [ 246 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 9  Now that you have the three reports rendering, you're ready to add interactive  elements, thereby creating a dynamic dashboard.  Adding interactive elements to the dashboard The first step is to add a commonly used JavaScript library known as prototype.js  to the dashboard.prpt report. You can download prototype.js from http:  www. prototypejs.org. Place the prototype.js file in the chapter9 war folder.  This example uses version 1.6 of prototype.js. To include this JavaScript file  in your report, add the following text to the append-header property of the master  report object:      Now, you're ready to add the Session ID select input. Place a label at the top of   the Report Header, in the space left available. Set the label text to Select a  Session:.  Update the label's append-body-footer property to the following  HTML and JavaScript:       this function removes cells and rows from     the generated HTML report for dynamic rendering function removeNodes node  {  if  node  {      var next = node.nextSibling;   node.parentNode.removeChild node ;   removeNodes next ;  [ 247 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Building Interactive Reports   } }     this function is triggered when a change occurs in the    selection list function filterChanged   {  var select = $ 'selection' ;  var currentValue = select.options[select.selectedIndex].text;      remove cells to allow room for dynamic iframe reports  var summary = $ 'summary' ;  removeNodes summary.nextSibling ;  removeNodes summary.parentNode.nextSibling ;  summary.colSpan = "7";  summary.className= "";       update the chart component with the correct filter  $ 'chart' .innerHTML = "<iframe width='261' height='240'     scrolling='no' frameborder='0'     src='.. report?reportName=subreport_chart&outputFormat=          html&sessionId="+currentValue+"' >";     update the pdf link with the correct filter  summary.innerHTML = "<iframe width='375' height='300' scrolling='no'    frameborder='0'    src='.. report?reportName=subreport_summary&outputFormat=         html&sessionId="+currentValue+"' >";   var pdfLink = document.getElementById 'pdfLink' ;  pdfLink.sessionId.value = currentValue; }                         1   2   3   4   5                This JavaScript references the HTML document object model locations of the  sub-reports. In order for this to be successful, you need to specify the xml-id  attribute for both the sub-reports as chart and summary.    [ 248 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 9  The above JavaScript first removes cells from the HTML document, and then places  two IFRAME elements within the HTML DOM. Pentaho Reporting renders a single  HTML table as output, so sub-reports don't get wrapped by a single HTML parent  element. The IFRAME elements must be used instead of direct HTML placements.  This is to make sure that CSS styles, and relative directory paths of images within  sub-reports, are both accessible. Add a label with a single space to the right side of the report. You'll add a View As  PDF button at this location. Edit the append-body attribute of the empty label with  the following HTML and JavaScript:  <form style="display:inline" id="pdfLink" action=".. report"  method="get">                     To demonstrate some of the event callback methods, specify the following  JavaScript within the on-click attribute of the chart sub-report element, within  the master report:  alert "You've clicked on the Chart" ;  Also, specify the following JavaScript within the on-double-click attribute of the  chart sub-report element, within the master report:  alert "You've double clicked on the chart" ;  The final master report should look like this in design mode within Report Designer:  You're now ready to save the changes and deploy them to the server. Note that there  are no changes necessary on the server side to enable this interactive report. In your  command prompt, type ant war to build the web archive, and ant start_tomcat  to restart the server.

Finally, click the View as PDF button. Notice that the  append-body attributes defined earlier do not render within the PDF document.  Summary In this chapter, you learned how to build interactive reports using Swing and HTML  as outputs. You learned how to modify report definitions to generate hyperlink  events, swing action events, and many different HTML JavaScript events. You built  from the ground up a Swing demonstration that selectively shows details of sales  sessions from the ElectroBarn data source, along with demonstrating feedback via  the ReportMouseListenter API.   You also learned how to render an HTML report on a server, along with including  external script files within the HTML rendered report. You learned how to modify  the report HTML document object model dynamically when events are triggered  from the report. You also learned to view an HTML report as a dashboard, finally  allowing the HTML report to be rendered as PDF.

You'll be introduced to  the schemas of the various XML files that persist the data source, parameters,  expressions, layout, and style of a report.    With examples of Pentaho's Java API, you'll learn how easy it is to build a report  programmatically. You'll walk through a complete example that demonstrates  creating different reporting bands, as well as different elements within a report.  Finally, you'll be introduced to the Pentaho Wizard Java API.  Understanding the serialized report   format Pentaho Reports are saved as .prpt bundle files. This is a ZIP-based file format that  includes all the necessary resources to render a report, also referred to as a bundle.  The .prpt bundle file contains a set of XML files that are crucial to rendering a  report, as well as additional resources such as embedded images and sub-reports.   This format is based on the OpenDocument format.  This section goes into detail about each of the primary files that make up a report,  along with providing a simple example of a report written by hand. With the  knowledge of the underlying file format, it is possible to generate reports outside   of the Java environment.  The key files that make up a report include settings.xml datadefinition.xml,  along with individual data source files, layout.xml and styles.xml.

If you set the property org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic. core.function.LogFormulaFailureCause to true, and you have your Log4J  logging set to debug, you'll receive a stack trace, in addition to an error message,  when the formula fails.  Additional configuration properties are available, primarily for use in design tools  such as Pentaho Report Designer. Rarely would you need to define a configuration  property while generating a report.  datadefinition.xml and the datasources folder The datadefinition.xml file contains information about report input parameters,  the report data source, as well as report functions and expressions. The root element in  this XML file is data-definition, and uses the http:  reporting.pentaho.org  namespaces engine classic bundle data 1.0 namespace for XML validation.  Parameters Parameters are defined as children to the data-definition parameter-definition  element. There are two types of parameters—plain parameters and list parameters.  Plain parameters are represented in XML as a plain-parameter element. Plain  parameters define four attributes:  [ 252 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   List parameters are represented in XML as a list-parameter element. In addition  to sharing the same attributes as the plain parameter, list parameters also define the  following attributes:  XML attribute name mandatory  type default-value  XML attribute query  key-column  value-column  value-formula  strict-values  allow-multi-selection  Chapter 10  Description The parameter name If set to true, a value for this parameter is required  before the report is rendered The fully qualified Java type of the parameter The default value of the parameter  Description The query name providing the list of values to choose  from. The key column is returned as the result within a row  that was selected. The value column is displayed as the selection when  presenting data to the user. The value-formula  attribute may be used in place of the value-column. The value formula is displayed as the selection when  presenting data to the user. The value-column  attribute may be used in place of the value-formula. If set to true, validation is done on the parameter value  to determine if it is part of the query results. If set to true, this attribute allows multiple selections  of parameter values from the query results, creating an  array of objects versus a single object.  Sub-reports define a different XML element hierarchy for their parameters. In the  context of a sub-report, a parameter is passed in from the master report's context  versus user or system input. Instead of using the parameter-definition element as  a parent, sub-reports use a parameter-mapping element. Two sub-report parameter  types are defined—import and export. Their XML element tags are import-parameter  and export-parameter. They both define the following two attributes:  [ 253 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   API-based Report Generation  XML Attribute name  alias  Description The name of the parameter. For imported parameters,  this is the name within the master report. For exported  parameters, this is the name within the sub-report. The alias of the parameter. For imported parameters,  this is the name within the sub-report. For exported  parameters, this is the name within the master report.  Data source reference A single reference to the report's data source is specified in the datadefinition.xml  file, as a data-definition data-source XML element. If multiple data sources are  used in a single report, you must use a compound data source that combines different  data sources. The data-source XML element defines the following attributes:  Functions and expressions Every function and expression defined in a report is represented by an expression  XML element. Expression elements have the following five attributes:  XML attribute report-query limit  timeout  ref  XML attribute name class  deplevel  formula initial  Description The named query used by the master report. If specified, defines the limit to number of rows returned  by the primary query of the report. If specified, defines the query timeout for the primary  query of the report. A reference to the specified data source definition file.  Description The name of the function or expression. The class type of the function or expression. This is not  required if specifying a formula. The dependency level of the function or expression,  which determines the order of execution. If specified, defines a formula for execution. If specified, defines a formula for initial execution.  Expressions may also contain properties. These properties appear within a  properties XML element as child property elements.

The class type of the property.  Finally, each property XML element contains a text node with the value of  the property.  The following is an example of a datadefinition.xml file that contains parameters  and a data source, as well as an expression:     <data-definition xmlns="http:  reporting.pentaho.org namespaces  engine classic bundle data 1.0">                <plain-parameter name="Library Size" mandatory="true" type="java. lang.Integer" >               <data-source report-query="Libraries" limit="0" ref="datasources  inline-ds.xml" >                 Data sources folder For each data source defined in a report, a data source file is created with the necessary  information to connect to the data source, usually stored in the datasources folder  within the .prpt bundle file. Defining every data source file is out of the scope of this  chapter. The following example XML is of an inline table data source:     <data:inline-datasource xmlns:data="http:  reporting.pentaho.org  namespaces datasources inline 1.0">                                                     libloader    [ 255 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   API-based Report Generation         114287                        libformula          331839                   As mentioned earlier, a compound data source is often used to refer to multiple data  sources in a single report. Here is an example of a compound data source definition:     <data:compound-datasource xmlns:data="http:  reporting.pentaho.org  namespaces datasources compound 1.0">         For each data source type, there is an equivalent XML format. These formats are  documented within their XML schema files, which are accessible when downloading  the source distribution of the reporting engine and extensions.  layout.xml The layout.xml file defines the primary structure of report bands and elements.  Each band is represented as an XML element, and each band's elements are  contained within the band. Multiple XML namespaces are used within the context   of the layout XML document. The primary namespaces include:   	  	  	  core, which defines core elements and attributes layout, which defines the majority of the elements in this document styles, which define inline styles   The styles namespace will be discussed in more detail in the styles.xml section  that will follow. The core namespace document is located at http:  reporting. pentaho.org namespaces engine attributes core The layout namespace,  which is specified as the default namespace for this document, is located at http:   reporting.pentaho.org namespaces engine classic bundle layout 1.0  The layout XML document contains a root layout XML element. This element  contains root level band information. The layout element may contain attributes  defining report level metadata such as the title of the report. The following child  XML elements may be specified within the layout element:  [ 256 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   XML element preprocessor  layout-processors  report-header  group  report-footer  Chapter 10  Description Any number of preprocessor elements may be  defined within the report layout element. Preprocessors  contain a class attribute that specifies the fully  qualified preprocessor Java class, and may contain  property elements for the preprocessor. Preprocessors  may manipulate a report before it is rendered. You'll see  an example of a preprocessor in the Wizard Java API  section of this chapter. Certain functions that manipulate the layout of  elements may appear within the layout-processors  element of the layout document. For instance, the  ItemHideFunction is considered a layout processor,  so if defined, it will be serialized into this portion of the  document. The report-header element specifies the layout  of the report header. This element contains a child  element entitled root-level-content, which  contains all references to child elements. Note that the  report-header is a report element. Therefore, it may  contain general element attributes and child elements,  defined later in the Report elements section of this  chapter. The group element defines the entire hierarchy of  groups and detail bands defined in a report. This  element hierarchy is defined in more detail in the Group  and detail band hierarchy section of this chapter. The report-footer element specifies the layout  of the report footer. This element contains a child  element entitled root-level-content, which  contains all references to child elements. Note that the  report-footer is a report element. Therefore, it may  contain general element attributes and child elements,  defined later in the Report elements section of this  chapter.  Also note that the report itself is represented as a report element. Therefore, in  addition to the attributes and child elements defined above, the report may also  contain attributes and elements defined in report elements.  These are covered   later in the Report elements section of this chapter.

A  group-body contains the XML element group to represent a hierarchy of groupings.  In addition to containing the group-body or data-body, a group XML element may  also contain group-header and group-footer XML elements. The group-header  and group-footer XML elements may contain a root-level-content XML element,  which contains child layout elements.  The data-body XML element contains the bands relevant to row level data in  your report. This XML element may contain detail-header, details, no-data,  and details-footer child XML elements. Each of these elements may contain a  root-level-content XML element, which contains child layout elements.  Report elements Each report element defined in previous chapters is represented in XML, defining its  properties, as well as where it is located within a band. The most common elements  are highlighted here.  All elements define the style:element-style child XML element, which contains  styling information for the individual element. The most common style element is  style:spatial-styles, which defines where in the band the element is located, as  well as what size it should render as:            Here is a list of some of the primary report elements, along with specific details on  creating them:  XML element label  text-field  number-field  Description The label XML element renders a label. This element  contains a core:value child element, which XML  Text is used for the label value. The text-field XML element renders a text field.  This element contains a core:field attribute, which  defines the field to render. The number-field XML element renders a number  field. This element contains a core:field attribute,  which defines the field to render, as well as a  core:format-string attribute, which defines the  number format string to render.

This element contains a core:field attribute, which  defines the field to render, as well as a core:format- string attribute, which defines the date format  string to render. The message XML element renders a message. This  element contains a core:value child. The resource-label XML element renders  a resource-label. This element contains a  core:resource-identifier attribute referencing  the message bundle, as well as a core:value  attribute, which specifies the key to use in the bundle. The resource-field XML element renders  a resource-field. This element contains a  core:resource-identifier attribute referencing  the message bundle, as well as a core:field  attribute, which specifies the field that is used to  determine the key to be resolved. The resource-message XML element renders  a resource-message. This element contains a  core:resource-identifier attribute referencing  the message bundle, as well as a core:value  attribute, which specifies the message. The rectangle XML element renders a rectangle.  The size of the rectangle is determined by the  style:spatial-sizes element defined above.  A style:content-styles XML element may  be defined, which specifies attributes such as the  boolean attributes draw-shape and fill-shape, as  well as color attributes such as fill-color. Colors  are represented in RGB hexadecimal notation, for  instance ff3333. The horizontal-line XML element renders a  horizontal line. The length of the line is determined  by the style:spatial-sizes XML element defined  above. A style:content-styles XML element is  defined to specify line style and color.

The length of the line is determined by the  style:spatial-sizes XML element defined above.  A style:content-styles XML element is defined  to specify line style and color. A sub-report XML element renders a sub-report.  The attribute href specifies where the sub-report  is located within the .prpt bundle. This XML  element may also contain information about its  location and style via the style:element-style  child XML element, as well as input and output  parameter mappings via input-parameter and  output-parameter XML elements. These mappings  are configured with the master-fieldname and  detail-fieldname attributes. A content XML element renders an image. The  location of the image binary is determined by the  core:value XML element. The scale and aspect ratio  properties for a content element may be customized  by specifying a style:content-styles element  with the attributes scale and keep-aspect-ratio. A content-field XML element renders a dynamic  image based on a field. The location of the dynamic  content to render is determined by the core:field  XML element. The scale and aspect ratio properties  for a content-field element may be customized by  specifying a style:content-styles element, with  the attributes scale and keep-aspect-ratio.  Additional report element types are defined within Pentaho Reporting. Those  listed in the table are the most common elements, along with some of their primary  properties and styles.

The styles.xml file contains the style root XML element, and includes namespaces  relevant to rendering styles, including the core and layout namespaces defined   earlier, as well as the style namespace as the default namespace, which is located  at http:  reporting.pentaho.org namespaces engine classic bundle  style 1.0. The following child elements may be specified within the style  XML element:  XML element page-definition  style-rule  Description The page-definition XML element contains  attributes defining the report's page properties. The  attribute pageformat specifies the page format  type. Examples include "LETTER" and "LEGAL". The  attributes horizontal-span and vertical-span  define how many pages a report should span across.  The width and height attributes define the width  and height of the paper. The orientation attribute  defines whether the page should be laid out as portrait,  landscape, or reverse-landscape. The attributes  margin-top, margin-left, margin-bottom,  and margin-right define the margin values for  the report. Multiple style-rules may be defined in the report.  A style rule has a name and parent attribute, which  define the inheritance tree of a group of styles. Within  the style-rule, style elements such as text-styles  and spatial-styles are defined, which contain  specific styling information.

The watermark XML element is rendered in the  background, behind other bands in a report. This  element contains a child element entitled root- level-content, which contains all references to child  elements. Note that the watermark is a report element,  so it may contain general element attributes and child  elements, defined earlier. The page-header XML element defines the contents  of the header for each page. This element contains   a child element entitled root-level-content,  which contains all references to child elements. Note  that the page-header is a report element, so it may  contain general element attributes and child elements,  defined earlier. The page-footer XML element defines the contents  of the header for each page. This element contains a  child element entitled root-level-content, which  contains all references to child elements.

Go into the directory where the files were created, and type  zip –r example_xml.prpt *.  Now, open the example_xml.prpt file in Pentaho Report Designer and click  the preview button. You should see a report that looks like the following:  Building a report using Pentaho   Reporting's Java API Now that you've built a report using Pentaho Reporting's XML format, it's time to  learn how to do a similar exercise, by building a report using Pentaho Reporting's Java  API. To avoid going over the entire Javadoc of Pentaho Reporting, this chapter covers  only the essentials. This includes references to important packages, making it easier to  find the classes, factories, and interfaces that you need to build your report. Pentaho  Reporting's Javadoc is available at http:  javadoc.pentaho.com reporting   The first step in working with Pentaho Reporting's API is to initialize the reporting  engine and create an empty MasterReport object.     Initialize the reporting engine ClassicEngineBoot.getInstance  .start  ;    Create a report object MasterReport report = new MasterReport  ;  The ClassicEngineBoot and MasterReport classes are located in the  org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core Java package.  Once you've created a report object, you're ready to step through the various  components that make up an entire report. The following sections demonstrate  setting up a data source, adding parameters to a report, including a function, adding  layout bands to the report, adding elements to a report, and customizing the report  page definition.  [ 266 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Adding a data source In Chapter 5, you created many different DataFactory classes and added them to  your reports. Here is a simple example of a DataFactory definition, along with code  to bind it to the report:  Chapter 10     Define a simple TableModel DefaultTableModel data = new DefaultTableModel                new Object[][] {      },  new String[] {"Name", "Size"}             ;                   {"libloader", 114287},  {"libformula", 331839}     create a TableDataFactory final TableDataFactory dataFactory = new TableDataFactory  ;     Add the table model to the factory dataFactory.addTable "default", tableModel ;     Add the factory to the report report.setDataFactory dataFactory ;  When starting from scratch, you must also tell the report which named data source  to use. You can do this by calling the following method:     set the main query to default for this report report.setQuery "default" ;  The default string is the name of the data source. Additional methods on the  report object that relate to data source configuration include setQueryLimit int  queryLimit  and setQueryTimeout int queryTimeout , which allow you to  specify the limit of rows returned in the result set, as well as the maximum length   of time a result set has to execute before the report engine ends the query.  Defining parameters By defining parameter types and validation information about parameters, the  reporting engine can validate incoming parameters. This information is also available  to the system executing the report, allowing for user prompting. Parameters are  managed using the ReportParameterDefinition API. This API is defined in the  package org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.parameters, along with  all the other classes and interfaces discussed in this section.  [ 267 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   API-based Report Generation  The ReportParameterDefinition API defines individual parameter  definitions, as well as the ReportParameterValidator class, which verify that  the entries are valid. The following example demonstrates the use of Pentaho  Reporting's default implementation, the DefaultParameterDefinition class.  Individual parameters use the ParameterDefinitionEntry API. Available  implementations of entries include PlainParameter, DefaultListParameter and  DefaultFormulaListParameter. The following code demonstrates configuring  a PlainParameter called Library Size:     Define a plain parameter PlainParameter entry = new PlainParameter "Library Size", Integer. class ;     Make the parameter Mandatory entry.setMandatory true ;     Add the parameter to our parameter definition paramDef.addParameterDefinition entry ;  Including functions and expressions To add a function or expression to a Pentaho Report, simply create the function  or expression instance and call report.addExpression Expression expression .  All expressions that get added to a report must implement the Expression interface.  All functions added to a report must implement the Function interface, which  extends the Expression interface. Most functions discussed earlier in this book,  along with the Expression and Function interfaces, are defined within the  package org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.function or a sub- package. Expression implementations use the JavaBean standard getters and  setters for configuring their properties. The following code demonstrates creating   a FormulaExpression instance and adding it to a report:     create a formula expression FormulaExpression formula = new FormulaExpression  ;     configure the formulas properties formula.setName "SizeKilobytes" ; formula.setFormula "=[Size]   1024" ;     add the expression to the report report.addExpression formula ;   [ 268 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 10  Defining the report's layout Similar to the layout.xml document described earlier in this chapter, defining the  JavaBeans that make up the report layout include the common report bands such as  the report header and footer, as well as the group band hierarchy that also includes  the details band.  Common report bands For each band defined in a report such as report header, report footer, page header,  and page footer, there are equivalent Java classes that are available, all extending  from the common abstract class Band, located in the org.pentaho.reporting. engine.classic.core package. These bands are all located in the same package.  Each band defines a set of JavaBean properties, but most simply use those defined  in the Band abstract class. One of the primary methods defined in this class is  addElement Element element , which you'll use later when creating elements  and adding them to their parent bands. A subset of Band implementations also  implement the RootLevelBand interface, which allows the addition of sub-reports  to the band via the addSubReport SubReport subreport  method. Bands such  as page header, page footer, and watermark do not allow rendering of sub-reports.  Here is an example of setting the report header and report footer in a report:     Create report header and footer objects  ReportHeader reportHeader = new ReportHeader  ; ReportFooter reportFooter = new ReportFooter  ;     add the report header and footer to the report report.setReportHeader reportHeader ; report.setReportFooter reportFooter ;  It can't get any easier than that!  Group band hierarchy Group bands also follow this simple JavaBean paradigm. Because it is possible to  nest groups, the API is a little bit more advanced. The RelationalGroup class is  used for regular relational groupings. The CrosstabGroup is used for defining cross  tabs within a report. The CrosstabGroup API is out of the scope of this chapter, but  is well documented in Javadoc.  The RelationalGroup class may contain a group header and group footer, as well  as a GroupBody implementation. GroupBody is an abstract class that SubGroupBody  and GroupDataBody extend. The SubGroupBody allows for nested groups, and  the GroupDataBody contains the ItemBand, as well as three other less used bands,  DetailHeader, DetailsFooter, and NoDataBand.  [ 269 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   API-based Report Generation  To configure a RelationalGroup class, you must provide a set of data row fields  that define the grouping. This may be done via the addField String field ,  setFields List fields , or setFieldsArray String[] fieldsArray  method  calls. In this example, you'll define a RelationalGroup and ItemBand, and group by  the Name field. Note that the ItemBand class represents a details band in a report:     Create the root relational group RelationalGroup group = new RelationalGroup  ;     Use "Name" as the root grouping group.addField "Name" ;     Create a group data body GroupDataBody groupData = new GroupDataBody  ;     Create an item band ItemBand itemBand = new ItemBand  ;     place the item band within the group data body groupData.setItemBand itemBand ;     place the group data body within the root group group.setBody groupData ;     set the root group within the report report.setRootGroup group ;  Adding elements to the report Now that you've set up all the bands for your report, you're ready to start adding  elements. Unlike the previous classes and interfaces introduced for bands, all  elements share a single class implementation, Element, and are created by element  factories. The Element class is located in the org.pentaho.reporting.engine. classic.core package. The primary set of element factories are located in the org. pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.elementfactory package.    To use a factory, first instantiate the factory object, and then configure the JavaBean  setters of the factory. Once you've built your element within the factory object,   call createElement   to retrieve the Element instance, which you will then add  to your report.

Factories also expose style attributes as  JavaBean setters, so it's possible to configure the location, size, and font style of   this element.     create a label element factory instance LabelElementFactory labelFactory = new LabelElementFactory  ;     configure the label's text labelFactory.setText "Library Information" ;     configure the label's location and size labelFactory.setX 1f ; labelFactory.setY 1f ; labelFactory.setMinimumWidth 100f ; labelFactory.setMinimumHeight 20f ;     set the font to bold labelFactory.setBold true ;     instantiate the label element Element label = labelFactory.createElement  ;  Now, add the label to your ReportHeader instance defined earlier:     add the label to the report header reportHeader.addElement label ;   It is important to note that for the JavaBean properties not set, elements inherit their  default values from their parent band. For instance, you can specify the bold attribute  on the ReportHeader instance, and all text elements will default to that value.     set the bold property to true, inherited by all     child text elements reportHeader.getStyle  .setStyleProperty TextStyleKeys.BOLD, true ;  [ 271 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   API-based Report Generation  Java API example In this example, you'll take what you've learned and incorporate it into a simple  Java Application.

You should see a report like this:  Wizard Java API In addition to building reports via Pentaho Reporting's traditional API, it is also  possible to build a report using Pentaho's Wizard API. This API is defined in the  wizard-core library, within the org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.wizard  package and sub-packages. The DefaultWizardSpecification class, defined in the  model package, allows you to quickly populate a report with groupings and details.  The Wizard API may incorporate predefined styles, allowing your organization to  easily generate dynamic reports that fit your company's style requirements.    [ 274 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 10  Once a WizardSpecification is defined, you can easily populate a report with just  two lines of code:  WizardProcessorUtil.applyWizardSpec styledReport, wizardSpec ; WizardProcessorUtil.ensureWizardProcessorIsAdded styledReport, null ;  The applyWizardSpec inserts the wizardSpec into the styledReport, and  the ensureWizardProcessorIsAdded method adds a WizardProcessor  as a ReportPreProcessor to the styledReport, by calling the  AbstractReportDefinition.addPreProcessor ReportPreProcessor  preprocessor  method.  In addition to defining a WizardSpecification instance, a data source must already  be configured before rendering a report.  To learn more about the Wizard API, please review the Javadoc at http:  javadoc. pentaho.com reporting org pentaho reporting wizard-core   Summary In this chapter, you walked through Pentaho Reporting's .prpt bundle file format,  and learned about the various XML documents that combine to render a report.  You learned how to define parameters, data sources, and expressions in the  datadefinition.xml file. You also learned how to lay out and style a report within  the layout.xml and styles.xml files. You combined all the files to generate an  example .prpt bundle file, and loaded the result in Report Designer to verify that it  renders as expected.  This chapter also covered the basics of building a MasterReport via Pentaho  Reporting's easy to use Java API. You saw examples of defining parameters, adding  data sources, and defining expressions. You also learned about how to build the  group hierarchy, and add elements to reports via Pentaho Reporting's element factory  approach. You then walked through a full example of a simple report, demonstrating  how easy it is to build a report from scratch, using just a few lines of code.  Finally, you received a brief introduction to Pentaho's Wizard API, which makes  API-based report generation an easy task.

You'll first begin with implementing your  own report functions and expressions. From there, you'll design your own formula  functions, as well as BeanShell expressions. Finally, you'll complete the chapter with  an example of writing a custom report element.  Implementing report functions and   expressions As you learned in Chapter 7, Pentaho Reporting comes with many already defined  functions and expressions. All expressions implement the Expression Java interface,  and all functions implement the Function Java interface—both are located in  the org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.function package. An  expression is stateless, and only has access to its current dataset row. Functions are  stateful, and may maintain state across rows of data.  Implementing expressions To implement an expression, you must define a class that implements the  Expression interface, as well as associated metadata, so the expression may  appear in Pentaho's Report Designer.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Extending Pentaho Reporting Defining an expression class The Expression interface defines the methods necessary for an expression to be  evaluated. The Expression Javadoc, available at http:  javadoc.pentaho. com reporting , provides details on each method within the interface. An  AbstractExpression class is provided, located in the same Java package as the  Expression interface, which implements the common interface requirements  of all expressions. This includes handling of common properties such as name,  dependency level, and preserve, as well as managing the reporting runtime,  which includes access to the data row and resource bundle factory.  To implement your own expression, extend the AbstractExpression class, add  JavaBean getters and setters for the properties you are interested in for configuration  of the Expression, and implement the Object getValue   method, which is part of  the Expression API. The getValue method will be called during report evaluation  on every row and band, in order to execute the Expression.  Also, you must provide a default constructor for your class. The reporting engine  will instantiate a single expression object during report execution.  Note that only certain class types may be used as properties for expressions. For  more information on which class types are supported, see the ConverterRegistry  class, located in the org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.util.beans  package, which defines the supported class types along with their converter classes.  Defining expression metadata If you would like your expression to appear in the Report Designer, you'll need  to create additional files that describe your expression. The first file that must be  defined is the expression properties bundle. This bundle is a standard Java resource  bundle file that contains specific name value pairs. The file should be located in  the same directory as the Expression implementation, and be named <Class  Name>Bundle.properties. Two properties—display-name and grouping—must be defined for each expression.  The display-name property defines how the expression is presented in the Report  Designer, and the grouping property defines which group the expression is  located in within the Add Function dialog. Each property name must begin with  expression. . —for example  expression.ExampleExpression.display-name=Example Expression.  [ 278 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 11  For each JavaBean property defined within the Expression implementation, the  display-name and grouping properties must be defined as well. The names of  these properties should appear in the bundle as expression.<package and class  name>.property. . —for example  expression.ExampleExpression.property.name.display-name=Name.  In addition to defining the bundle, you must also provide expression metadata  in XML. This is done using Pentaho Reporting's metadata XML namespace. The  element should be defined in an XML file as a child element called expression,  with a root node of meta-data. The expression XML element should contain  the following XML attributes:  Expression attribute Class  Bundlename Result  hidden  Description The fully qualified class name of the Expression  implementation. The fully qualified path of the resource bundle defined above. The fully qualified class name of the value returned by the  method getValue  . This attribute can be set to true or false. If true, the element  will not appear in the Report Designer.  Also, the expression element should contain a property XML element for each  JavaBean property defined in the element. The property element should contain  the following XML attributes:  Property attribute name mandatory value-role  hidden  Description The name of the JavaBean property. Set mandatory to true if this attribute must not be null. The role this value is used for. This helps determine the type  of editor to display in the Report Designer. The following are  valid options—Value, Resource, ElementType, Query, Field,  and Group. This attribute can be set to true or false. If true, the   element will not appear in the Report Designer.

The Module interface is defined in Pentaho Reporting's libbase subproject within the  org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.base.boot package. The AbstractModule  class is created to simplify defining a new module. An implemented module should  contain a default constructor with a call to the AbstractModule loadModuleInfo    method. This loads the necessary module configuration files, which are defined  below. To load your expression metadata file, define the following method:  public void initialize final SubSystem subSystem  throws  ModuleInitializeException  Within the method, make a call to ElementMetaDataParser.initializeOptional ExpressionsMetaData String xmlFile  with a reference to your metadata XML  file defined above.  In addition to defining your Module class, you must also define a  module.properties file that describes your module. This properties file should  contain the following properties:  Property name module.name module.producer module.description module.version.major module.version.minor module.version.patchlevel  dependency.core.module  dependency.core.dependency-type  dependency.core.version.major  dependency.core.version.minor  Description The name of the module. The author of the module. The description of the module. The major version number of the module. The minor version number of the module. The patch level version number of the  module. This is the name of the module in which  you require to exist before loading. In most  cases, this should be set to  org.pentaho.reporting. engine.classic.core. ClassicEngineCoreModule This describes the type of dependency,   usually set to required. The major version number of the  dependency. The minor version number of the  dependency.  dependency.core.version.patchlevel The patchlevel version number of the   dependency.

Once you've defined your Module implementation, you must also register the  module with the reporting engine. To do this, create a properties file at the root  of your JAR, containing your module called classic-engine.properties, with  a property called org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.extensions. modules. .Module, setting its value to the full module class name  including its package. The reporting engine searches the classpath for this file, and loads the modules listed.  You may use a single Module to define multiple expressions and  other extensions within Pentaho Reporting.  An example expression This example will demonstrate creating an expression by implementing the  RegexExpression class. This expression will take a data field, run it through  a regular expression, and then render a message containing groups from the   regular expression. First, you'll need to set up the Chapter 11 project. Create a folder chapter11, and  copy the chapter10 lib folder into the new project. Also, create an src folder.  Now, create the file RegexExpression.java in the src folder, and stub out a class.  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.function. AbstractExpression; public class RegexExpression extends AbstractExpression {         }  public RegexExpression   { }    add properties here    add getValue here  Now that you've stubbed out the expression class, you're ready to give it a set of  properties. Add two properties that are relevant to this expression. The first is regex,  which will contain a defined regular expression. The second is field, which will  contain the data field to parse. Add the following lines of code after the    add  properties here comment: private String regex; private String field; public void setRegex String regex  {   } public String getRegex   {  this.regex = regex;  [ 281 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Extending Pentaho Reporting  return regex;    } public void setField String field  { this.field = field; } public String getField   {   }  return field;  It's now time to write the getValue   method of the expression. This method uses  the two expression properties and returns a result. Add the following lines of code  after the    add getValue here comment:     wrap the regex code in a try catch, so that an  public Object getValue   {         error message can be presented if the parsing failed.           create a pattern based on the regex input final Pattern p = Pattern.compile regex ;  try {            lookup the field, and if not null, create a matcher final Object o = getDataRow  .get getField   ; if  o == null  {   } final Matcher m = p.matcher o.toString   ;  return null;                                     }                          } catch  Exception e  {     }     find the first match in the string m.find  ;     return the first group found within the match return m.group 1 ;     return the error message instead return e.getMessage  ;  To complete the RegexExpression class, you must also add the following imports  to the beginning of the class:  import java.util.regex.Pattern; import java.util.regex.Matcher;  [ 282 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 11  Now that you've defined the Expression class, you must also define a properties  file describing the expression. Create the RegexExpressionBundle.properties  file in the src folder, and add the following contents:   The name and grouping of the expression expression.RegexExpression.display-name=Regex Expression expression.RegexExpression.grouping=Other   The field property expression.RegexExpression.property.field.display-name=Field Name expression.RegexExpression.property.field.grouping=Other   The regex property expression.RegexExpression.property.regex.display-name=Regex expression.RegexExpression.property.regex.grouping=Other   common properties, name and dependencyLevel expression.RegexExpression.property.name.display-name=Name expression.RegexExpression.property.name.grouping=Common expression.RegexExpression.property.dependencyLevel.display- name=Dependency Level expression.RegexExpression.property.dependencyLevel.grouping=Common  To finish defining all the necessary metadata for the expression, create a   src meta-expressions.xml file, which contains details about the expression:  <meta-data xmlns="http:  reporting.pentaho.org namespaces engine  classic metadata 1.0">    <expression class="RegexExpression"               bundle-name="RegexExpressionBundle"               result="java.lang.String" hidden="false">      <property name="dependencyLevel" mandatory="false"                value-role="Value" hidden="false" >      <property name="field" mandatory="true" value-role="Field"               hidden="false" >      <property name="regex" mandatory="true" value-role="Value"               hidden="false" >     <property name="name" mandatory="true" value-role="Name"               hidden="false" >        To complete this example, you need to define a reporting module that will  manage the initialization of the expression and other examples that appear later in  this chapter. First, create the file Chapter11Module.java in the src folder, which  loads the meta-expressions.xml file.

Create a report with a table data source, with the following values:  Field Please call 513-523-1222 at your earliest convenience. The number 518-123-5555 is unlisted. To place an order, call 941-563-1324.  Drag-and-drop the Field into the details band. Also, add a label with the text "Fields"  in the report header. Now, add a Regex Expression to the report. Set the Field  Name equal to Field, and the regex equal to  \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4} . This regular  expression will find the first phone number in the field. Drag the expression into   the details band, and run a preview of the report. Also, add a label in the report  header called Phone Number. Your results should look something like the following:  Save this report as chapter11.prpt—you'll be using it later in this chapter.

The Function interface  extends the Expression interface, as well as the ReportListener interface defined  in the org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.event package. Functions  receive event notifications while the report is being generated, allowing functions  to detect progress in report generation. See the ReportListener Javadoc for the  various callbacks that the Function interface receives.  An additional class called FunctionUtilities, located in the org.pentaho. reporting.engine.classic.core.function package, provides useful methods  for accessing elements within a report, as well as determining the exact state of  report generation. Knowing that the report is in the prepare run state is important  for functions calculating values. This is possible with the FunctionUtilities. isDefinedPrepareRunLevel   method call. Please see the FunctionUtilities  Javadoc for additional information on the utility functions available.  Functions must provide the same exact metadata that an expression defines,  as described above. There are many examples of Function and Expression  implementations in the reporting engine core project that demonstrate everything  from row banding to open formula evaluation.  Implementing a formula function As described in Chapter 7, formulas are used in many places within a report for  dynamic evaluation. Pentaho Reporting allows the definition of custom formula  functions so that developers may extend the capability of the formula subsystem.  To define a formula function, you must implement the Function interface located  in the org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.formula.function package, as well  as a FunctionDescription defined in the same package. Note that this is a different  Function interface as described earlier. The two methods a formula function must  implement are:     This is the name of the function as it appears in the formula public String getCanonicalName  ;     this method evaluates a result based on the incoming parameters public TypeValuePair evaluate FormulaContext context,                               ParameterCallback parameters        throws EvaluationException;  [ 287 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Extending Pentaho Reporting  The TypeValuePair class simply contains a variable value and its type.  The FormulaContext class provides access to the formula system, and the  ParameterCallback class provides information about the parameters being  passed into the current function.  The FunctionDescription interface describes details about the function, including  its inputs and output type. The AbstractFunctionDescription class is available to  simplify the implementation of your FunctionDescription class. When using the  AbstractFunctionDescription, you must implement the following methods in  your description class, along with a properties bundle file:  Method Default Constructor  FunctionCategory getCategory    int getParameterCount    Type getParameterType int  position  public Type getValueType   public boolean  isParameterMandatory int position   Description The default constructor of your  description class must call  AbstractFunctionDescription's  super String canonicalName,  String messageBundle  parent  constructor to initialize properly. Defines which FunctionCategory  the formula function should appear in.  Normally, custom functions should return  UserDefinedFunctionCategory. CATEGORY. Defines the number of parameters  accepted by this function.  Returns the parameter type of a parameter  expected at a specific position. Returns the result value type. Returns true if a parameter is required at a  specific position.  The properties bundle contains information about the function. Required   properties include:  Property Description The canonical name of the formula function. display-name The description of the formula function. Description parameter. .display-name The display name of the Nth parameter. parameter. .description  The description of the Nth parameter.

Regex formula function example In this example, you'll define a function called regex, which takes a regular  expression and an input string, returning the first matching group of the regular  expression.

Congratulations! Your new formula results should look  identical to the regex expression example defined earlier.  Implementing BeanShell expressions Another approach to implementing your own report expressions is using the  BSHExpression report expression, which uses BeanShell to evaluate an expression.   BeanShell is a Java code interpreter, so you can write Java for direct execution  within a report with this expression. The BSHExpression contains a property called  expression, which should contain the necessary BeanShell script. This script must  contain the Object getValue   method, which is called to evaluate the expression.  Imports and additional functions may be included in the expression. The expression  also has access to the DataRow class instance named dataRow. This allows for easy  access to the current row of data for the expression to use.  Example BSHExpression Open up the already defined chapter11.prpt, defined earlier in this chapter,  within Report Designer. Now add a Bean-Scripting-Host  BSH  expression, which  is located within the Script function group. Set the expression property to the  following BeanShell syntax:  import java.util.regex.*; Object getValue   {                       }  try {             } catch  Exception e  {     }  final Pattern p = Pattern.compile " \\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4} " ; final Matcher m = p.matcher dataRow.get "Field"  ;    find the first match in the string m.find  ;    return the first group found within the match return m.group 1 ;     appropriate way to log a error   warning message? return e.getMessage  ;  Drag-and-drop the expression onto the details band, below the other expressions.  You should see results similar to the first and second examples above. To learn   more about BeanShell, please visit http:  www.beanshell.org .

In this section, you'll walk through the necessary steps to implement a basic report  element.  You'll learn how to define an ElementType, XML read and write handlers,  as well as all the metadata necessary to have your report element appear in the  Report Designer.  Chapter 11  Defining an ElementType class The first step in defining a new report element is implementing the ElementType  interface, located in the org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.metadata  package. This interface defines a set of methods that allow the creation and  rendering of an element within a report.     the getMetaData method returns the element type's     metadata, including the element name, attributes and styles public ElementMetaData getMetaData  ;     Inherited from the DataSource interface, the getValue     method generates a renderable object that will appear    in a report. public Object getValue final ExpressionRuntime runtime, final Element  element      the getDesignValue returns a design time rendering of the    element.  This is useful if you have an element     without access to its source data. public Object getDesignValue ExpressionRuntime runtime, final Element  element ;     the configureDesignTimeDefaults method is used in     designers when an element is first added to a report. public void configureDesignTimeDefaults Element element, Locale  locale ;  The getValue method must return a Java object that the report engine knows how to  process for rendering.  This includes the types java.lang.String, java.awt.Shape,  org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.util.ReportDrawable, along with  any class that defines the following method, which is executed via introspection:  public void draw Graphics2D, Rectangle2D   The ReportDrawable interface defines the draw method, as well as additional  methods providing access to the report configuration, the current stylesheet, and   the resource bundle factory. Also defined is the getImageMap method, which allows  the ReportDrawable implementation to define a clickable map over the content.  [ 293 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Extending Pentaho Reporting  The Report Engine renders in multiple formats, and each format  handles the rendering of Java graphics differently. For instance,  PDF rendering, which uses iText, translates the rendered items  within the Graphics2D context into PDF elements.  In the getValue method, the current element instance is provided for access to its  attributes and styles. See the org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core. Element Javadoc API for details on how to access attributes and styles.  Defining element metadata Now that you've defined the main ElementType class, you need to define the metadata  to go along with the element. Element metadata is similar to expression metadata  defined earlier. The element should be defined in an XML file with a root node of  meta-data, as a child XML element called element. This XML file should use the  namespace: http:  reporting.pentaho.org namespaces engine classic  metadata 1.0. The element XML element should contain the following attributes:   XML attribute Name Hidden  Deprecated  container  bundle-name implementation  Description The name of the element type. This attribute can be set to true or false. If true, the element  will not appear in the Report Designer. This attribute can be set to true or false. This attribute is not  used at this time. This attribute can be set to true or false. If true, the element is  recognized as a container type element. The fully qualified location of the resource bundle. The fully qualified class name of the ElementType  implementation.  The element XML may also contain child elements, defining attributes and styles.  The attribute XML element contains the following XML attributes:   Attribute Namespace Name Mandatory  Description The namespace of the attribute. The name of the attribute. This attribute can be set to true or false. This attribute is not  used at this time.  [ 294 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 11  design-time-value  Attribute Hidden  Computed  Deprecated  prefer-bulk  value-type value-role  propertyEditor  bundle-name  Description This attribute can be set to true or false. If true, the attribute  will not appear in the Report Designer. This attribute can be set to true or false.  If true, this attribute  will not be serialized. If computed, and design-time-value is set, the attribute will  still be serialized. This attribute can be set to true or false. This attribute is not  used at this time. This attribute determines where in the element XML the  attribute is serialized. The fully qualified Java class name of the attribute value. The role this value is used for. This helps determine the type  of editor to display in the Report Designer. The following are  valid options—Value, Resource, ElementType, Query, Field,  and Group. Defines the java.beans.PropertyEditor class for  this attribute. Defines the fully qualified bundle name for this attribute.  In addition to defining custom attributes and styles, defined elements may also  import existing groups of attributes and styles. To reference these groups, first   you must include the global XML file within the root meta-data XML element:    <include-globals src="res:  org pentaho reporting engine classic  core metadata global-meta-elements.xml" >  Within the child element, you must specify an attribute-group-ref child XML  element, or a style-group-ref XML element, to include a group. Set the ref  XML attribute to the named group. Examples of common attribute groups include  common-attributes and interactivity. Examples of common styles include  borders, common, layout, and replaced-content. See the global-meta-elements. xml for additional groups.  Elements, along with their attributes and styles, may refer to resource bundles  for defining localized property information. For element properties, the  syntax is element. . = . For attributes  and styles, the syntax is element. .attribute.<ATTRIBUTE_ NAMESPACE>. . . Localized properties for elements,  styles, and attributes include:  [ 295 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Extending Pentaho Reporting  Property display-name grouping grouping.ordinal ordinal  description deprecated icon  Description The name displayed in the Report Designer. The group in which the item appears. The defined group location relative to other groups. The ordinal location of this item related to other items  in the Report Designer. The description of the item. A deprecation message if the item is deprecated. A reference to the element icon, displayed in the  Report Designer. This property does not apply to  attributes and styles.  Once you've defined the meta-elements.xml file, as well as its resource bundle, you  must inform the reporting engine that these elements are available. You may do this  by calling the following method within your module's initialize method:  ElementMetaDataParser.initializeOptionalElementMetaData "meta- elements.xml" ;  Defining read and write handlers Now that you've defined the ElementType class, as well as the metadata  relating to the element, you're ready to define the element's read and write  handlers, so you can serialize the element state to XML. You'll do this by  defining an ElementReadHandler, as well as a BundleElementWriteHandler.  The ElementReadHandler interface is located in the org.pentaho.reporting. engine.classic.core.modules.parser.bundle.layout package, and the  BundleElementWriteHandler is located in the org.pentaho.reporting.engine. classic.core.modules.parser.bundle.writer package. Luckily for us, the  reporting engine defines abstract classes that do most of the serialization work,   based on the metadata you defined for your element.  Read and write handlers are registered through the module's configuration. properties file. A demonstration using the AbstractElementReadHandler and  the AbstractElementWriteHandler class is provided in the following section.  An example report element This example will demonstrate what you just learned by walking through a full  implementation of a new ElementType, a star shape, and seeing it run within the  Report Designer.

You now need to create the file StarWriteHandler. java in the src folder with the following code:  import java.io.IOException;  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.Element; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.parser. bundle.writer.BundleWriterException; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.parser. bundle.writer.BundleWriterState; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.parser. bundle.writer.elements.AbstractElementWriteHandler; import org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.docbundle.

Open up  Chapter11Module.java, and add the following line to the initialize method:  ElementMetaDataParser.initializeOptionalElementMetaData "meta- elements.xml" ;  You also need to create the module's configuration.properties file with the  information regarding the read and write handlers. This file should be created in   the src folder. Add the following text to the configuration file:   define the prefix for this configuration org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.parser.bundle. element-factory-prefix.pr4jd=pr4jd.   define the pr4jd namespace for this configuration pr4jd.namespace.pr4jd=http:  reporting.pentaho.org namespaces pr4jd   define the pr4jd namespace for the metadata org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.metadata.namespaces. pr4jd=http:  reporting.pentaho.org namespaces pr4jd   define the star read handler pr4jd.tag.pr4jd.star=StarReadHandler   define the star write handler org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.parser.bundle. writer.element-write-handler.star=StarWriteHandler  You're now ready to build the project and see some stars. Type ant jar to build the  chapter11.jar file. Place the chapter11.jar file in the lib folder of the Report  Designer, and start the Report Designer. You should see the star element within the  list of elements. Drag-and-drop a star element into the report header.  In addition to adjusting the star's custom properties, you may also use the   built-in styles to configure the border and colors, as well as properties such as   aspect ratio. These capabilities are available because you defined a Shape object  as the element value. Set the star's inner-percent to 0.75, and points to 16. Under the Style tab, set fill to  true and fill-color to yellow. Add a label over the star, and preview the report in  PDF. You should see something like this:  [ 304 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 11  Save your report, and reopen it. The star was saved into the .prpt file with the  defined XML write handler, and reopened using the defined XML read handler.  Due to the table rendering technique used when generating HTML, Excel,  and RTF outputs, by default Shape objects are not rendered during  report generation. You may enable Shape rendering by setting the report  configuration property org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic. core.modules.output.table.html.ShapeAsContent to true  via a JVM system setting. Table renderers do not allow overlapping of  elements, so in the previous example, the Pentaho Reporting label would  be hidden until it was moved below the star.  Summary In this chapter, you learned a great deal about Pentaho Reporting Engine extension  points. You learned the details of implementing a report expression, including  defining the Expression class, as well as all of the necessary metadata to view the  expression in the Report Designer. With the RegexExpression example, you were  able to execute your own expression in the Report Designer. You also learned about  report functions and how they differ from expressions.  Next, you learned how to implement your own formula functions, as well as the  necessary metadata to execute the formula function within the Report Designer. You  took the same regex example and placed it within the formula system. You then used  the BSHExpression to add your own custom code directly into a report within the  Report Designer.  The chapter ended with an introduction to building report elements, and you created  a star element that defines its own set of properties and renders different types of  stars within reports.

You'll start off by learning about Pentaho's  Business Intelligence Server, which acts as a centralized reporting server where  users can publish, schedule, and create ad hoc reports. From there, you'll learn  how to use Pentaho Reporting for mobile reporting. The chapter continues with  a look at the MetaTableModel API, which provides data source metadata to a  report. Also included in this chapter is a brief introduction to Pentaho Reporting's  OutputProcessor API for generating custom report output types. The chapter  concludes with additional information about the Pentaho Reporting community   and where to go for help.  Using Pentaho Reporting with Pentaho's  Business Intelligence Server As part of Pentaho's suite of products, Pentaho offers an open source Business  Intelligence Server. The BI Server is a web application which allows users to publish  and manage reports within an enterprise Business Intelligence system. The BI Server  offers many capabilities, including the management and execution of Pentaho  Reports. Combining Pentaho Reporting and Pentaho's BI Server, information  technologists may utilize Pentaho Reporting in their environment without writing  any code. In addition to the publishing and execution of reports, the open source  BI Server allows for scheduling, background execution, security, and much more.  With Pentaho's Enterprise BI Server, additional capabilities are available, including  enterprise auditing as well as server management.  In this section, you'll get a taste of the capabilities within the BI Server related to  Pentaho Reporting.

The  file to download begins with biserver-ce-. Pentaho Reporting 3.5 is included in this  release of the BI Server. The BI Server is a large download, and comes bundled with  much more than Pentaho Reporting. The download includes an Apache Tomcat web  server, which includes the Pentaho web application, a sample HSQLDB database, as  well as an administration console for managing users and database connections.  Before you start the server, you need to enable a publish password so that you  can send reports from the Report Designer application to the server. Unzip the  distribution, and go into the bi-server-ce pentaho-solutions system folder.  Edit the publisher_config.xml file, updating the empty publisher-password  XML element with a password such as:   password   Now go back to the bi-server-ce folder and execute start-pentaho.bat. This will  start the sample HSQLDB database, as well as Tomcat.  Once you've started the server, you may visit http:  localhost:8080 pentaho in  your browser to view the Pentaho User Console, where BI related content is hosted,  created, and executed.

This starts the administration console application, which is  hosted within a Jetty web server. It is accessible by visiting http:  localhost:8099   in your browser. The default username and password are admin and password.   Publishing a report to the BI Server Now that you have the BI Server running, you're ready to publish a report to the  server.  Open one of the example reports within Pentaho Report Designer. You can  access the sample reports through the main menu by going to the Help  Welcome  screen and double clicking on a report in the samples tree. All of these reports are  based on the same sample database provided in the BI Server. Select File  Publish.  You'll see the following dialog:  [ 309 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics  Make sure the URL is set to http:  localhost:8080 pentaho. Enter your user  credentials for the BI Server. The example user joe with the default password  password is provided. Click OK. You should see a repository browser dialog:  Name the report, and traverse into the steel-wheels folder. Note that you cannot  publish reports in the root of the repository. Enter your recently created publish  password and click the OK button. The report is sent to the server via HTTP. You  can now log into the BI Server and execute the report.  Report definitions published to the server are stored in the server's solution  repository, and are given default author read and write permissions. Report  definitions may be deleted by going to the BI Server's solution navigator, right- clicking on the file, and selecting Delete.

This feature is even more useful if you configure the report  for email, which is described below. To schedule a report, right-click on the report  within the Pentaho User Console solution navigator and select Schedule.... This  brings up the following dialog:  Chapter 12  Enter a name, group, and description. Groups allow you to organize your schedules,  so you can enter any group name that you prefer. You may choose from a set of  recurrence options. As an example, choose Weekly, and check Monday at 8PM,  beginning with the current date.

Select View   Workspace from the main menu. The workspace contains all of your schedules,  including results generated from those schedules:  In addition to defining custom schedules, administrators may define a public  recurring schedule and attach reports to that schedule, so business users may   easily register for pre-canned reports.

This is possible by configuring permissions on folders  and individual published reports. Right-click on a folder or a report and select  Properties. Now select the Share tab:  Chapter 12  From this view, you can manage individual users and role permissions for the file  or folder selected. Each item in the repository has a set of permissions for various  actions such as Execute, Create, and Schedule. Later in this section you'll learn how  to add and manage roles and users for the BI Server.  Report emailing and bursting To enable advanced features within the BI Server such as report bursting and  emailing, you must wrap your report in an action sequence. Action sequences  are created using the Pentaho Design Studio, and can be thought of as a simple  programming environment for advanced business users. The Pentaho Design Studio  is based on the Eclipse project.  You can download the Design Studio from Pentaho's  SourceForge project page.  [ 313 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics  Once you've downloaded and unzipped the Design Studio, you'll walk through  creating a simple emailed report. Launch the Design Studio by executing  PentahoDesignStudio.bat. This brings up a design environment. To begin, you  need to create a project that will host your action sequences. Select File  New   Project..., and create a project using the General  Project wizard.  For Linux users, you will also need to create a workspace  directory before defining your project.  Once you've created your new project, create a new action sequence by selecting BI  Platform  New Action Sequence in the main menu. Select your recently created  project as the container, and name your action sequence. Finally, select Send Email  as the template for the action sequence and click OK. This will open the new action  sequence on the Define Process tab.   The action sequence is created with predefined action inputs, along with an  EmailComponent ready to send out an email. You'll need to update the inputs with  your own values, and add a report to the action sequence to complete the example.  [ 314 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 12  Click the to input parameter, and enter in the default email ID you'd like the report  to be sent to. You may also adjust the from, subject, and message input parameters,  which define who the report will be sent from, along with email details.  Now you need to add a report component to the action sequence, which generates  a report from the PRPT file. Select the add image-button under Process Actions,  and select Report  Pentaho Report. Click the Browse… button under the Report  Specification text field, and locate your PRPT file. Also, enter "pdf" as the Report  Format. Finally, set the Output Report Name for reference later. The configured  report component should look something like this:   Make sure that your report component appears above the EmailComponent in  the process list. To complete the action sequence, click on the EmailComponent,  and scroll to the bottom of the component screen. Click the Attachments add  image-button and select the Output Report Name defined in the previous step.  Now save your changes. The file is saved with an .xaction extension.  You're now ready to deploy the action sequence to the server. To do this, copy the  .xaction file along with the PRPT file into the bi-server pentaho-solutions  steel-wheels folder.  [ 315 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics  Before executing the report on the server, you need to configure the BI Server's  email settings. Open the bi-server pentaho-solutions system smtp-email  email_config.xml file, and update the SMTP configuration with your SMTP server  settings. Once you've made your changes, run Tools  Refresh  System Settings  in the user console as an admin user. Also, to have the action sequence appear in   the solution navigator, you will need to run Tools  Refresh  Repository Cache. Once you've successfully published the new action sequence to the server, log  into the BI Server and browse to the solution location where the report was saved.  Execute the action sequence. You should see a success message, as well as receiving  the email.  To broaden this example to burst the report to multiple individuals, you would  need to set up a method for accessing multiple email addresses, as well as adding  a loop within the action sequence to email the report multiple times. The email list  might be stored as an action sequence string-list input parameter, or possibly stored  in a database accessible through the use of an action sequence SQLLookupRule  component, which you can add to an action sequence in Design Studio by selecting  Get Data From  Relational in the Process Actions menu. To add the loop within  the Design Studio, select Loop in the Process Actions menu, and select your list or  result set as the loop on field. To learn more about the Design Studio, please see the Design Studio documentation  located on Pentaho's wiki: http:  wiki.pentaho.com display ServerDoc2x  Design+Studio.  Managing database connections and users Managing database connections and users for the Pentaho BI Server is done through  the Pentaho Administration Console. This application appears in the BI Server under  the administration-console folder. If you haven't already, you can launch the  Administration Console by typing startup.bat. This starts a web server on port  8099.  Open a browser and go to http:  localhost:8099. A basic authentication  dialog will appear. The default username and password for the administration  console are admin and password.

This section of the Administration Console contains the User and Roles tab,  as well as the Database Connections tab. Click on the User and Roles tab. From this  screen, you can easily add and remove users and roles to be used within the BI Server:  [ 317 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics  Now click on the Database Connections tab. On this page, you can add, manage,  and remove configured JDBC database connections.  The BI Server comes pre-configured with the SampleData database connection,  which connects to the HSQLDB sample data database provided with the application.  If you are using a JDBC driver that isn't already packaged with the BI Server, you'll  need to install it before configuring your database connection. Place the JDBC  driver in the administration-console jdbc folder, as well as within the tomcat  webapps pentaho WEB-INF lib folder, and restart your web server for the driver  to be recognized.  Creating ad hoc reports In addition to publishing reports made in Report Designer, the BI Platform allows  users to create reports on the fly based on predefined Pentaho Metadata models,  as well as SQL Queries and CSV files. In order to enable Pentaho Metadata  functionality, a DBA or IT Expert would need to use Pentaho Metadata Editor as  described in the data sources chapter, and publish the model to the BI Server. Once  published, users are able to define their own reports without requiring knowledge  of SQL and table relationships. The ad hoc reporting tool appears in the user console  when users click on the new report toolbar icon:  [ 318 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 12  To learn more about many of the other capabilities of the BI Server, please visit  http:  www.pentaho.com.  Mobile reporting When discussing mobile reporting, there are multiple factors involved in providing  a robust reporting solution. This section focuses on discussing issues with building  a mobile reporting solution for the latest smart phone platforms. Most of these  platforms have some capability around viewing rich document formats such as  PDF, Excel, and HTML. Also, most of these platforms have the ability to create basic  navigation HTML web pages or install a custom application that allows navigation.  [ 319 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics  Mobile report server The first step in building a mobile reporting solution is developing a report server  that can support mobile clients. Due to the differences in smart phone technologies,  it's important that the reporting server has the ability to detect the phone technology  that is making the request, and proxy to the correct service for providing a mobile  user interface. For instance, if your reporting server was using a rich HTML  Javascript client, you may not want to attempt to render that on a mobile phone.  Instead, you would redirect the request to a simpler version of the user interface.  Because most smart phones provide PDF rendering capabilities with similar results,  it's most likely that your reporting server will default to rendering the reports as  PDF. Various smart phone technologies also support Excel viewing, so making this  an option for a general reporting server is also valuable.  Another consideration when hosting a report server meant for mobile use is mobile  phone access to Intranets and wireless networks. Not all mobile phone platforms  provide VPN access, so it may be necessary to provide access outside your Intranet  to your report server. This increases the need to verify that your web server hosting  the report server is secure, and that only authorized business users from your  organization have access to the server.  [ 320 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 12  Another option to consider when building a report server that works with  multiple smart phone technologies is providing an XML-based web service layer,  implementing smart phone native applications for browsing reports instead of  relying on the smart phone's browser as a delivery platform. The disadvantage to  this approach is the need to implement and maintain one or many custom phone  applications. Advantages to this approach include offline browsing of cached  reports, as well as richer integration with the platform for things such as ad hoc  report generation and event-driven report generation. Imagine a scenario where  a report is automatically requested and stored locally on a smart phone when a  business user arrives at the office on Monday morning. This type of capability is  possible today only by implementing a custom application on a specific smart phone  platform that offers geo-location capabilities.  At this time, there are no known mobile platforms that can execute Pentaho's  reporting engine natively within a phone's operating system, but as smart phone  technology evolves, this could become possible. Having the ability to generate  reports directly on a phone opens up even more possibilities for the future of mobile  reporting. Business application developers who are moving more capabilities to   the mobile phone may consider rendering PDF and Excel based reports directly   on the phone itself, instead of relying on a reporting server.  Mobile report design While any report designed as a PDF should render on a smart phone, it's important  to consider the implications of mobile reporting when designing reports. Mobile  phones have less memory, and may have a difficult time rendering a large report  with many pages of data. For this scenario, designing summary reports and enabling  drill through into sub-reports might be useful.  Also when designing a report, it's important to consider the screen size in which  the report will be rendered. Font size and style become important when building a  report specifically designed for the phone. Because of potential incompatibilities with  fonts and layout, make sure to test designed reports on the mobile platform before  releasing it out to business users.  Example: Pentaho's iPhone BI extension Pentaho offers an open source extension to the BI Server, which allows easy  navigation and report execution on the iPhone. The following link describes  the steps for configuring the BI Server:  http:  wiki.pentaho.com display COM Enabling+the+iPhone+BI+Extension.

A similar approach could be used for designing navigation for Google's  Android, Windows Mobile, Palm, and Blackberry smart phone technologies.  Data source metadata in Pentaho   Reporting As described in Chapter 5, data sources implement the DataFactory interface which  returns a TableModel, representing the data used to populate the report. Pentaho  Reporting defines an extension to TableModel, called MetaTableModel. This  extension to TableModel allows the report to query column and cell-level metadata,  allowing for customization of styles dynamically based on the data source.  [ 322 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 12  One example of this implementation is the Pentaho Metadata DataFactory. As  described in Chapter 5, Pentaho Metadata allows business users to build queries and  select data without requiring knowledge of SQL or the underlying database schema.  Along with those capabilities, it is also possible to attach style attributes to business  columns. For example, metadata information can be fed into Pentaho Reporting to  manage the formatting of a number within a report, or to adjust the font styles of a  column within a report.  Most implementations of metadata define their metadata differently. Pentaho  Reporting provides a method for mapping external metadata values to known  Pentaho Reporting attributes and styles.  MetaTableModel API The MetaTableModel interface defines four additional methods to the  TableModel interface. The MetaTableModel interface is located within the  org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core package. Following are the  four methods and descriptions of each:     getTableAttributes returns a list of table wide attributes.  public DataAttributes getTableAttributes  ;     getColumnAttributes returns a list of attributes     per column.  public DataAttributes getColumnAttributes final int column ;     isCellDataAttributesSupported returns true if     the implementation supports cell level data attributes.      The OLAP data factories are an implementation example     of cell level data attributes.  public boolean isCellDataAttributesSupported  ;     getCellDataAttributes returns a list of attributes     related to a specific cell in the table model.  public DataAttributes getCellDataAttributes final int row,                                            final int column ;  The DataAttributes interface, located within the org.pentaho.reporting. engine.classic.core.wizard package, defines the following methods, used  to access individual metadata:     getMetaAttributeDomains returns the namespaces of     metadata attributes available.  public String[] getMetaAttributeDomains  ;     getMetaAttributeNames returns the list of attributes   [ 323 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics     under a particular domain.  public String[] getMetaAttributeNames String domainName ;     getMetaAttribute returns the value of an attribute.  public Object getMetaAttribute String domain,                                String name,                                Class type,                                DataAttributeContext context ;     getMetaAttribute returns the value of an attribute,     returning a default value if not set  public Object getMetaAttribute String domain,                                  String name,                                  Class type,                                  DataAttributeContext context,                                  Object defaultValue ;     getMetaAttributeMapper returns the defined concept     query mapper for a particular attribute.  public ConceptQueryMapper getMetaAttributeMapper                                               String domain,                                                 String name ;  The ConceptQueryMapper interface is related to mapping external metadata,  and will be described in the next section.  For a real world example of a MetaTableModel implementation, please see the  PmdMetaTableModel class, located in the org.pentaho.reporting.engine. classic.extensions.datasources.pmd package within Pentaho Reporting's  extension-pentaho-metadata project.  Mapping external metadata Pentaho Reporting manages the mapping from external metadata through the use of  the data schema XML specification. The dataschema.xsd XML schema file is located  in Pentaho Reporting's engine-core project.  To register a data schema XML file with mappings, a reporting module must  specify a property starting with org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core. DataSchemaDefinition within its configuration properties file. Once registered,  the reporting engine manages the mapping of its named attributes and styles to   the external system's metadata.

The three supported mapping types that appear as child  XML elements are—direct-mapping, indirect-mapping, and global-mapping.  The direct-mapping element requires a field attribute, which specifies the  TableModel column name in which to map a property. The direct mapping may  contain data-attributes and data-attribute-mapping elements as children.  The data-attributes element may contain XML attributes that map directly to  a style or attribute within Pentaho Reporting.    The data-attribute-mapping element defines the mapping between Pentaho  Reporting's attributes and the specific MetaTableModel attribute namespace, also  referred to as a domain. The attributes—source-domain and source-name—define  the MetaTableModel class's attribute instance. The target-domain and target- name attributes define the reporting engine's attribute instance. If the attribute  concept-mapper is defined, the value is used as the ConceptQueryMapper class  to be used for conversion from the MetaTableModel class's attribute type to the  reporting engine's attribute type.  The indirect-mapping element contains a match XML element, which contains  a domain and name attribute describing the external attribute to match. Optionally,  you may specify a type and value attribute. The type attribute defines what Java  class type the value is, and the value attribute is the specific value required for  matching. These match elements are used to determine if the indirect-mapping  applies to the current MetaTableModel implementation. The indirect-mapping  elements also specify the data-attributes and data-attribute-mapping  elements defined above. The indirect-mapping element is more widely used  over the other two element types for integrating metadata into the reporting engine.  The global-mapping XML element defines the same data-attributes and  data-attribute-mapping as the previous mapping elements, and requires no  additional configuration. All data-attribute and data-attribute-mapping  elements contained within global-mapping elements are passed into the final  data schema used by the report.  The ConceptQueryMapper interface allows conversion from external metadata  system Java types to Pentaho Reporting's expected attribute types. This interface  defines a single method:     getValue converts an external metadata value to the    expected Pentaho reporting object type.  public Object getValue final Object value, final Class type, final  DataAttributeContext context ;  [ 325 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics  The DataAttributeContext object provides access to the running report's context  such as the locale of the report.  Using metadata attributes in a report Only a subset of attributes and styles defined in Pentaho Reporting support  external MetaTableModel metadata without the use of OpenFormula. The  MetaDataStyleEvaluator class, located in the org.pentaho.reporting.engine. classic.core.function.sys, manages updating the individual supported  elements within a report. Only those elements that define the field attribute located  in the core namespace, or the labels-detail-header attribute located in the  wizard namespace, support these metadata attributes.  In addition to defining these attributes, the element must also have the   sstyle-format attribute, located in the query-metadata name space, set to true.  Otherwise metadata attributes are ignored. The following is a list of all the style  attributes that are currently supported:   	 font-family  	 font-size  	 bold  	 italic  	 underline  	 strikethrough  	 color  	 background-color  	 horizontal-alignment  	 vertical-alignment  It is also possible for the metadata to set the format-string, as well as the value  attribute of a report element, as long as the data-format attribute located in the  query-metadata namespace is set to true within the element. An example of this  might be to set a report label's value based on metadata. You would need to set the  label's labels-detail-header attribute to the MetaTableModel column containing  the value metadata, as well as setting the label's data-format attribute to true. This  would allow the label's value to be set to the MetaTableModel class's label attribute,  located in the formatting namespace.  [ 326 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 12  If the format-string isn't explicitly set by the MetaTableModel, the reporting  engine uses the AutoGeneratorUtility, located in the org.pentaho.reporting. engine.classic.core.wizard package, to determine a correct format string.  Additional metadata is accessed to determine the correct format, including the type,  currency, scale, and precision attributes. A format string is generated if the type  is of java.util.Date, java.sql.Date, java.sql.Time, or java.lang.Number.  Another method for applying metadata from a MetaTableModel is to use the  METADATA formula function. This function takes three parameters and returns  a metadata value. The first parameter is the column name in which to extract  metadata, the second parameter is the namespace of the metadata value, and   the third parameter is the metadata name for the value being accessed.  Current MetaTableModel implementations A few working examples are available within reporting to demonstrate the use  of MetaTableModel. The first, already discussed, is Pentaho Metadata. Pentaho  Metadata allows easy configuration of the supported style attributes. Additional  column metadata is used during wizard report generation such as display-size,  which is used to calculate relative column widths.  Another working example is the SQLReportDataFactory. The MetaTableModel  implementation exposes ResultSet metadata, including column names as well as  column types.  The other working examples of the MetaTableModel are the olap4j and Mondrian set  of DataFactory classes. Using OLAP allows for cell-level metadata, not just column  level metadata.    All existing implementations of MetaTableModel only use  indirect-mapping with data-attribute-mapping elements.  There are no existing examples of global-mapping or direct- mapping in use within the reporting engine today.  The metadata and OLAP projects can be found within Pentaho Reporting's SVN  repository under engines classic trunk extensions-pentaho-metadata,  engines classic trunk extensions-mondrian, and engines classic trunk  extensions-olap4j.

You'll define a report that utilizes data source metadata  attributes, and build a DefaultMetaTableModel that provides those attributes.  Instead of building a new workspace for this chapter, reuse the Chapter 11  project, so you can easily reuse the module configuration for this example. First,  you'll need to define a MetaTableModel implementation.  Create the file src  DefaultMetaTableModel.java, with the following source code. The inline  comments describe the key areas of functionality.  import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;  import javax.swing.event.TableModelListener; import javax.swing.table.TableModel;  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.MetaTableModel; import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.wizard.

For this example, you'll take a shortcut. Open the Report Designer,  and build a very simple report. Create a static table of data, with a single column  named Value with data Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3. Name the static table default. Now add the Value field to the report Details band. Modify the background color  style formula for this field, which appears in the Style tab as text  bg-color. Set it to:  =METADATA "Value"; "exampleDomain"; "bg-color"   [ 330 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Chapter 12  This executes the metadata formula function described earlier, looking for the  metadata attribute bg-color in the exampleDomain namespace. Now place a report  label in the report header. Set the label's labels-detail-header value to the Value  field. The labels-detail-header value can be found as part of the Attributes tab under  the wizard category. This informs the engine that the label should use column-level  metadata from the Value column in the table data source. Also set the label's data- format and style-format metadata attributes to true. Both of these attributes can be  found as part of the Attributes tab under the query-metadata category. This informs  the reporting engine to look for the value metadata attribute for the Value column,  which is located in the engine's formatting namespace.  Preview your report. At this point, there is no metadata feeding the label or the  background color, so you should see a report like this:  Save your report as metadata_table.prpt in the chapter11 data folder. You'll  now write a simple application that loads the report definition and renders a PDF.  Before rendering the report, you'll update the report's TableModel, named default,  defined earlier with metadata from your DefaultMetaTableModel implementation,  including your two metadata attributes—bg-color and label.

These interfaces, along with abstract class implementations, make it  possible to write your own custom output generator. In this section, you'll discover  the main interfaces within the API, learn about some of the key classes involved in  rendering a report, as well as walk through a very simple example demonstrating  how to render a report to your own custom format.  The OutputProcessor API is used during the last stage in general report processing.   Before the calls are made to the OutputProcessor API, a ReportProcessor  implementation generates an internal logical model of the report to be rendered.  This includes executing all the functions defined, calculating all the locations and  sizes of individual components within the report, and in the case of a paged report,  determining which content goes on what page.  Once a ReportProcessor has completed the internal calculations necessary for  rendering, it then proceeds to making calls into the provided OutputProcessor  implementation. When implementing your own output layer, you must implement  the OutputProcessor interface, as well as the OutputProcessorMetaData interface.  The OutputProcessor and OutputProcessorMetaData interfaces are located in  the org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.layout.output package.  The OutputProcessorMetaData interface The OutputProcessorMetaData interface provides a general metadata  interface for the OutputProcessor, including which features and content are  supported, as well as providing access to the report configuration along with  access to font metric details. The class AbstractOutputProcessorMetaData  is available, which implements the common set of functionality across the  various output implementations. As an example, the Excel implementation of  OutputProcessorMetaData configures the various features of Excel rendering  based on configuration properties, while the PDF implementation also overrides  some of the default font behavior for translation into the PDF format.  [ 335 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics  The OutputProcessor interface The OutputProcessor interface defines callbacks so that the ReportProcessor  may trigger rendering of the output. During the processing of a report  and after it is complete, a call is made to the processContent method for  each logical page generated by the Renderer implementation, described  later. The class AbstractOutputProcessor is available, which implements  common state management tasks. Two subclass implementations— AbstractPageableOutputProcessor and AbstractTableOutputProcessor— are available for the different output rendering types.  Pageable outputs include  documents such as PDF, while table outputs include documents such as Excel   and HTML.  The AbstractPageableOutputProcessor traverses the logical page,  providing direct access to each physical page within the page grid. The  AbstractTableOutputProcessor provides a flattened two dimensional  structure of the report, useful for rendering cell based formats. The  AbstractTableOutputProcessor also implements the IterativeOutputProcessor  interface, an extension to the OutputProcessor interface, which allows for  iterative rendering.  RenderNode Document Object Model The OutputProcessor receives the report model in a RenderNode Document  Object Model, which it translates to a specific output. The RenderNode class,  located in the org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.layout.model  package, is the base of the RenderNode DOM and defines a set of core attributes.  Child classes add additional metadata. For instance, the RenderBox class provides  a linked list of children, and acts as a container object. The RenderableText and  SpacerRenderNode contain the text-related information within a report, while the  RenderableReplacedContentBox contains references to content such as images  and Java Shape and Drawable objects.  The RenderNode objects are generated during the rendering process. The Renderer  implementations within the reporting engine manage the creation of the RenderNode  DOM. The two primary rendering implementations are PageableRenderer, which  manages generating individual pages, and StreamingRenderer, which ignores pages.

The org.pentaho.reporting.designer. core.actions.report.preview package contains the default implementations  as examples. These examples contain the user interface and report generation code,  allowing previews in the various supported formats.  To add the action to Report Designer's menu system, edit the designer-frame.xul  file located in the org.pentaho.reporting.designer.core.xul package. Find the  file-preview-popup menu pop up element in the XUL file, and add a new menu  item with reference to the action class name.  Under the covers, the Report Designer uses its own OutputProcessor, the  DesignerOutputProcessor, which only works with the logical page model, for  rendering of the report in design mode. This guarantees compatibility between the  Report Designer and the reporting engine, reusing the same layout algorithms for  both rendering and designing a report.  Example: PojoObject output In this example, you'll implement your own OutputProcessor and  OutputProcessorMetaData classes that will generate a list of PojoObject instances,  containing their text and location within the report. To keep the example simple,  you'll write a main method within a PojoUtil class that executes the simple report  metadata_table.prpt defined in the earlier MetaTableModel example.  First, create the PojoOutputMetaData class, which must provide an export  descriptor.  This descriptor is accessible by report functions, allowing the report to  know which context it is rendering in. The expected syntax of the export descriptor   is [output class] [output type] [output sub type]. Create the file  chapter11 src PojoOutputMetaData.java with the following source code:  import org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.layout.output. AbstractOutputProcessorMetaData; import org.pentaho.reporting.libraries.base.config.Configuration;  public class PojoOutputMetaData extends  AbstractOutputProcessorMetaData {     Define a basic constructor that calls its super.         public PojoOutputMetaData final Configuration configuration  {   }  super configuration ;  [ 337 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics     Provide an export descriptor.  public String getExportDescriptor   {   }  return "stream pojo";        }  Now you'll begin to build the PojoOutputProcessor class. This class implements  the OutputProcessor interface, and manages the creation of the list of plain old  Java objects, which will contain an x and y coordinate, along with the text associated  with that location. Comments have been placed in the source that describe the  inner workings of this very simple example.

To  make sure you can find what you need to engage the Pentaho Reporting community.  The following is the list of online places and tools to help you get started.  Asking questions, helping others Today, there are two primary methods of communication within the Pentaho  Reporting community. The first and most widely used are the Pentaho Reporting  forums. These forums are located at http:  forums.pentaho.org  under the main  category Reporting.  Thomas Morgner, the founder and primary architect of Pentaho  Reporting, also known as Taqua in the forums, has over 4,800 posts and is always  helping out folks with their questions. You can search and read forum discussions,   or sign up for an account and ask your own questions.  Another method of communication is Pentaho's IRC channel, set up by Pentaho  community members. This channel is located on the chat.freenode.net server,  as channel pentaho. A large number of active Pentaho community members are  available to answer technical questions.  Online documentation Pentaho hosts a wiki, which contains community documentation for Pentaho's  various projects. You can find the wiki at http:  wiki.pentaho.com, which  contains links to Pentaho Reporting documentation, as well as tech tips that walk  through specific use cases. As a wiki, community members may contribute their   own tech tips or documentation around any of the Pentaho projects.  Pentaho also hosts a sub-domain dedicated to the Pentaho Reporting community  at http:  reporting.pentaho.org, which contains information about the latest  releases and download links. Also, Javadoc for the latest versions of Pentaho's  open source projects is hosted online at http:  javadoc.pentaho.com. Pentaho  Reporting Javadoc can be found at http:  javadoc.pentaho.com reporting .  Submitting bugs and viewing backlogs To submit a bug, or view Pentaho Reporting's backlog, you can visit Pentaho's  JIRA bug tracking system at http:  jira.pentaho.com.  [ 343 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by David Martone on 16th September 2009 710 South Avenue West, , Westfield, , 07090  Download at WoWeBook.Com   Additional Pentaho Reporting Topics  Pentaho Reporting is broken out into two main projects—the Pentaho Reporting  Engine and the Pentaho Report Designer. Each project contains a Road Map link,  containing a list of prioritized activities that Pentaho and the open source community  are working on.  Contributing code If you'd like to add a new feature to Pentaho Reporting or fix a bug, the source code  for the reporting engine and Report Designer is easily accessible. Pentaho hosts the  reporting project's SVN server at http:  source.pentaho.org pentaho-reporting.  The reporting engine's core source code is located in the engines classic sub-folder,  and the Report Designer is located in the tools report-designer sub-folder. By  going to http:  source.pentaho.org viewvc pentaho-reporting , you can  browse the source and version changes using your browser.  Once you've made your change, you can submit your patch to Pentaho's JIRA  system. If you become a regular contributor, often Thomas will grant you direct  commit access to SVN.  One of the many types of contributions Pentaho receives includes translated message  bundles. These message bundles are located within the reporting projects, and can be  found by searching for messages.properties files within each project. For instance,  there are many of these files within the engine-core project.    Enterprise support Pentaho offers an Enterprise Edition of Pentaho Reporting, which includes direct  customer support, as well as additional functionality such as enterprise auditing  within Pentaho's Business Intelligence Server. If you are working within an  enterprise and would like to purchase an enterprise license, you can contact Pentaho  directly by visiting http:  www.pentaho.com. Subscription customers have  access to Pentaho’s Knowledge Base, which contains many articles and enterprise  documentation on all of Pentaho's products.  Pentaho also offers online and in-person training courses, which include hands on  tutorials of the Pentaho Report Designer, as well as the Pentaho Business Intelligence  Server. Pentaho works with a large set of partners to offer consulting, which  may include everything from setting up your reporting server to writing custom  functionality that your business requires.

You began with an  introduction to Pentaho's open source Business Intelligence Server, which allows  organizations to publish, schedule, and build reports from a web application.  You learned about action sequences for emailing and bursting reports, along with  learning where to set up database connections and add users to the BI Server. You  also were introduced to mobile reporting, which included a reference to Pentaho's  iPhone BI Extension.  Also in this chapter, you discovered Pentaho Reporting's data source metadata  capabilities by implementing your own MetaTableModel class. You were introduced  to Pentaho Reporting's output rendering API through a simple plain old Java object  output example.  Finally, you learned more about the Pentaho Reporting community, including where  to go to ask questions, file bugs, and how to contribute back to Pentaho's open source  reporting projects.  Thank you for taking the time to read this book. I hope you learned a lot along   the way, and are excited about using Pentaho Reporting to solve your business  reporting needs!

Therefore by purchasing Pentaho Reporting 3.5 for Java Developers, Packt will have  given some of the money received to the Pentaho project.  In the long term, we see ourselves and you—customers and readers of our books—as part of  the Open Source ecosystem, providing sustainable revenue for the projects we publish on.  Our aim at Packt is to establish publishing royalties as an essential part of the service and  support a business model that sustains Open Source.

Writing for Packt We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals  should be sent to author@packtpub.com.
