www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Preface  In 2011, Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton were working at Twitter on a number of  projects. The two creators of the Bootstrap framework needed a way to achieve  consistency across them all. The solution they developed was the Bootstrap CSS  framework. Over time, more developers came on board and the project quickly  became the most popular repository on GitHub. As time has passed, the framework  has become the backbone of websites and web applications across the Internet.  Other companies have tried to emulate their success by creating their own internal  frameworks, but Bootstrap still remains the gold standard of open source CSS  frameworks.  Bootstrap provides developers with all the CSS tools that they need to quickly develop  websites. It has a deep feature set, is easy to learn, is mobile-first, and is cross-browser  compatible. Hundreds of additional components and plugins have been developed by  programmers, making it the go-to tool for web designers everywhere. Bootstrap Site Blueprints Volume II provides you with detailed instructions on how  to develop some of the most common website and web application types on the  Internet. If you have struggled with using Bootstrap in the past or applying a custom  look and feel to your projects, this book will give you the foundation that you need  to become a Bootstrap master.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Advanced Bootstrap Development Tools, is a quick introduction to Bootstrap.  This chapter also covers some advanced development tools that can be used to make  Bootstrap site development easier, such as Less, Node.js, EJS, and Harp.js. Chapter 2, Building a Restaurant Website, is where we take our Harp.js development  environment and build a restaurant website. This will include building more page  templates, introducing Google web fonts, customizing Bootstrap components, and  much more.  [ ix ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3, Mobile-First Bootstrap, covers how to do the following: create a mobile-first   website using Bootstrap, design a mobile-first website, use Google material design  colors and styles, do advanced customizations on the Bootstrap modal component,  use jQuery to make a search bar hide show effect, and create a static, single-page  app using Bootstrap. Chapter 4, Bootstrap Wiki, tells us how to create a wiki layout with Bootstrap and  how to add multiple templates to a project in Harp. You also get to learn how to  customize the navigation modal you made in the previous chapter, how to use Harp  partials for more than just the header and footer, and how to code your template in   a modular fashion to save time and produce Less code. Chapter 5, Bootstrap News Magazine, illustrates the creation of a magazine website  using Bootstrap, and a new way to lay out a header using inline divs. Here, we see  how to construct a complex footer using multiple parts, how to use flexbox with   a Bootstrap grid, and how to use a basic jQuery to improve the experience of your  article page. We also implement a Disqus-powered comments section. Chapter 6, Bootstrap Dashboard, teaches you how to code a dashboard using Bootstrap,  how to create a project with a dark look and feel, and how to implement and  customize the Chartist JavaScript library. In this chapter, we customize the Bootstrap  panels component, the Bootstrap table component, and the Boostrap nav and navbar  components. We also see how to use a mobile nav outside of the default navbar. Chapter 7, Bootstrap Social Network, covers the coding of a social network using  Bootstrap. We customize the Bootstrap well component, the Bootstrap navbar  component, and the Bootstrap alert and button components. Finally, we see   how to create a highly modular design for easy reuse of code and components.

[ xiii ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Advanced Bootstrap  Development Tools  Although Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework on the block, which  polarizes web developers of all skill levels, one of the main complaints against  it is that it's too large and hard to use. The primary goal of this book is to give  you an advanced set of tools to make building websites with Bootstrap easier  and even enjoyable. We'll start out by showing you how to create a development  environment and workflow that is easy to set up and reuse in all your Bootstrap  projects. From there on, we'll tackle a number of common website designs to  get you comfortable with the advanced techniques. Finally, we'll include some  JavaScript libraries and really take our Bootstrap projects to the next level. Sit  back, fire up your code editor of choice, and get ready to dive into some advanced  Bootstrap blueprints.  In this chapter, you'll learn:     How to create a development environment with Harp.js    How to run a localhost server with Node.js to preview your project    How to write templates with EJS and use variables and partials    How to set up your theme with Less in the most efficient manner    How to compile your project for production  [ 1 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Theming is hard!@ I won't lie. Bootstrap theming can be really challenging. There is a large library  of components that take some time to understand, and learning the best ways to  customize them also takes time. But what if there was an easier way? I'm happy  to say that I've designed a workflow using some modern frontend development  tools that make it much easier to work with Bootstrap. The problem with frontend  languages such as HTML and CSS is that they lack some core programming features,  such as variables and includes. Thanks to tools such as Less for CSS and Harp.js for  templating, these missing features are now available for building static websites.  Harp.js – the static web server with   built-in preprocessing The title says it all, and it is taken from the official http:  harpjs.com  website.  Harp is an open source project from some of the same people who brought us  PhoneGap, and it is my tool of choice for any static website project I work on.   Why is Harp so great? Here are just a few reasons:       It includes automatic preprocessing of languages such as EJS, Jade,  Markdown, CoffeeScript, Less, Sass, and Stylus     Harp converts the aforementioned languages into vanilla HTML, CSS,                   and JavaScript and feeds it to the browser It allows powerful templating through the use of common layouts and  partials or includes for PHP people It includes a lightweight web server that compiles your code in the  background for quick and easy testing It passes in custom metadata through JSON to save your time It compiles all of your code into production-friendly files that you can   deploy on your server.  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books you  have purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub.com.  If you purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http:  www. packtpub.com support and register to have the files e-mailed  directly to you.  [ 2 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating a development environment Everything that I outlined earlier basically creates a development environment for  your Bootstrap websites. The advantage of using a development environment is  that you can use tools such as Harp to make your website development faster and  easier. It provides you with a working copy on your local computer, and you can use  that copy to develop your projects. When you're done, you can compile it into the  production version and deploy it on the Internet. It's a good idea to get into the habit  of creating a development environment because it's a better coding practice and  makes it easier to maintain your project in the future. This is because the production  code is totally separate from the source development files. Running a localhost server  for testing also allows you to build new features without having to worry about  negatively affecting your live production website.  Installing Node.js The web server that is built into Harp runs on Node.js. Therefore, you will need to  install Node on your computer before you can set up Harp. If you don't have Node  already installed, head over to the following link to download the version you need:  http:  nodejs.org download   Once you've downloaded and installed Node, you'll have to open and use the  command line to test the installation. If you're on a Mac, I'd recommend that you use  the terminal or an app such as iTerm to access the command line. If you're working  on Windows, you can use Cygwin. Once you've opened up your command-line app,  type in the following line:  If you have installed Node correctly, the number of the version you have installed  should be printed on the terminal. You should see something like this:  $ node -v  $ v0.10.33  Great! Now we can move on to installing Harp.  Installing Harp.js Actually, setting up Harp.js is really easy. If you have closed your terminal, open it  again. Insert this command if you're on a Mac:  $ sudo npm install -g harp  [ 3 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you're on Windows, use the following command:  $ npm install -g harp  After you execute this command, you should see a bunch of packages being installed  in the terminal window. Once everything stops loading, Harp is installed. To verify  that it has worked, enter the following in the terminal and hit Enter:  $ harp version  This should give you the version number, which means that Harp was successfully  installed.  Since Less preprocessing is included with Harp, we don't need to install anything  special to use Less. This is great news, because we don't need to rely on less.js or a  standalone compiler app. Once we compile our Harp project and run the web server,  any changes to Less files will be picked up automatically. For now, just celebrate, and  we'll cover compiling Less in more detail a little later.  Setting up a boilerplate project For the rest of this chapter, I'm going to teach you how to set up a Bootstrap  boilerplate project in Harp. Moving forward, this boilerplate will be the basis for all  the projects in the book. One of the great things about Harp is that you can simply  copy and paste a project to create a new instance of it on your local machine. There  are also some other commands that you can run to generate project scaffolding,  and I welcome you to check them out at http:  harpjs.com docs . However,  for this book, we aren't going to take any shortcuts, and I'm going to show you  how to manually set up a project. The best practice is to do it the hard way first  so that you learn how it works. This will save you a headache down the road if  you are troubleshooting a problem. The first thing you should do is navigate to a  directory on your computer where you want to store your project. In the directory  you created the following files and sub directories. For the time being, just leave  the .json and .ejs files blank. We'll fill them in a little later. Take a look at the  following image to see how your project directory should look.  Note that there is a project boilerplate available for download or forking  from GitHub at https:  github.com cardeo booterator.  [ 4 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This is the root of our project, and here we'll find everything at a high level:      css: This directory will contain all our custom CSS and the Bootstrap   framework CSS files.      fonts: This directory will be for holding any web fonts or icon web fonts.   The directory isn't totally necessary, but I always include Font Awesome  with all my projects so that I have an icon library to pull from.      img: This directory will hold all the images for the project. For the   boilerplate, we won't actually need any images, but we're setting this up for  future projects too.      js: This directory will hold any custom libraries and the Bootstrap   framework's JavaScript file.      partial: This directory will hold the pieces of code that we want to reuse in   our templates, such as our header and footer.     _data.json: This is the file in which we will define any metadata that we  want to use in our template. An example of this could be the page title for  each web page.     _harp.json: This is a file for setting global properties, such as the title of the   website, which is used on all pages.     _layout.ejs: This file is the scaffolding for our page. It includes the    and   sections of our document. At the very least, you need one layout  in every Harp project. It is possible to have multiple layouts if you want to  load in JavaScript libraries to only some pages.  [ 5 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      index.ejs: This file holds the actual code for our boilerplate home page.   This is the body or content of the page minus the wrapping template pieces  that are held in _layout.ejs.  The Embedded JavaScript  EJS  template language is very similar  to HTML and is therefore really easy to grasp. The advantage of  using EJS is that it allows the use of elements such as variables.  Setting up the CSS Now that the root of our project is set up, let's set up the subdirectories. We'll start  with the CSS directory by adding the following files. Now would be a good time to  download the latest version of Bootstrap from http:  getbootstrap.com if you  haven't done so already. Again, just leave theme.less blank for now.  Within the components directory, create a Less file and name it _variables.less.  Leave this file blank for the time being.  Starting a file with an underscore in Harp will mark it as a template  file that should not be a straight copy to the production directory.  It is file that should be compiled into another to create a full HTML  page or CSS style sheet.  Let's quickly walk through the files in the  css directory:     bootstrap.min.css: This is the Bootstrap CSS framework. When you  download the Bootstrap package, there are a number of other CSS files.  We don't need any of those files; we only need the minified version of the  framework.      components: This is a directory for storing the Bootstrap component's Less  files. If you are customizing a Bootstrap component, you should create a Less  file for it and enter the custom CSS.  [ 6 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      theme.less: This is the master file for our CSS. All our components should  be imported into this file so that upon compilation, it will be a single theme. css file for our project.  Setting up the fonts Bootstrap comes with Glyphicons out of the box, which is fine. I, however, prefer to  use font awesome because their license is more flexible. To add font awesome to your  project, head to http:  fontawesome.io and download the package. Unzip it into  your computer after downloading and copy the contents of the  fonts directory to  your project's  fonts directory. Next, go to the  css folder and copy font-awesome. min.css to your project's  css directory. For now, that's all you need to do; we'll  hook up everything else a little later. The  fonts directory should now look like this:  Setting up the JavaScript For our boilerplate, all that we need to do is copy bootstrap.min.js to our  js  directory. Like the Bootstrap CSS, there are a few JavaScript files included in the  download package. You can ignore the other files as we won't need them.  Setting up the partials The last directory that we need to set up is our partials. If you come from the PHP  world, note that partials are includes. They are little snippets of code that are reused  across all or many of your pages, such as your header, footer, and navigation.  Partials are one of the best features of Harp because you can update these template  pieces in one place when changes occur, instead of updating on every page! For now,  create two files in your  partial directory, called _header.ejs and _footer.ejs.  Now that we've finished setting up the basic structure of our project, we can move  on to actually filling in some code for our .json and .ejs files.  [ 7 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up _harp.json I'm going to start with _harp.json before _data.json. This is because the first   file deals with the global settings for our project. In this case, we're going to use  _harp.json to set up a global variable that will map to the website name for our  project. Later on, we'll insert this variable into our layout so that it appears on every  page of our website. Enter the following code and save it:  {   "globals": {     "siteTitle": "My Bootstrap Boilerplate"   } }  What we've done here is set up a global variable named siteTitle and set its value  to My Bootstrap Boilerplate. Once we insert this variable into our layout, the title  will be shown on every page of our project.  This is only a fraction of what you can do here. Check out  http:  harpjs.com docs development globals  to learn more about globals.  Configuring _data.json If _harp.json applies to all the pages in our website, _data.json contains page- specific data for our project. In this case, I'm going to set up a variable that can be  used to insert the page name for each page of my project:  {   "index": {     "pageTitle": "Home"   } }  Here's how this data works:     The index refers to the name of my ejs template that I want to target.   Currently, we have only one, called index.ejs.     The pageTitle is a variable I created for the title of each of my pages. We'll   need to insert this variable into the layout later on.    Finally, I entered a value of Home for my variable.  Again, there is more that you can do with metadata in Harp, but at this point, this  is all that we need. To learn more about Harp metadata, visit http:  harpjs.com  docs development metadata.  [ 8 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up the layout As I mentioned previously, _layout.ejs is the wrapper file for my index.ejs page  template. Layouts can be reused, and pages will always default to using _layout. ejs unless you tell them otherwise. If you want to create a second layout for use on  a specific page, you simply have to create a new file called something like _layout- two.ejs. Then, in your _data.json file, you have to add a second line to your  template declaration that points to the new layout:  {   "index": {     "pageTitle": "Home",      "layout": "_layout-two"   } }  When you're working with your .json file, file extensions  are not required.  Now, that's an example of how to use multiple layouts. For our boilerplate, we'll  need only one layout. A layout file can be written in mostly normal HTML, but we  need to insert a yield property to tell Harp where to insert the content from the page  file  index.ejs . We also need to insert the variables that we defined in _harp.json  and _data.json. Open up your _layout.ejs file in the root of the project and insert  the following   code:                  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-      scale=1">             <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"       href="css bootstrap.min.css">   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="css font-      awesome.min.css">        <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements     and media queries -->  [ 9 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via       file:   -->         <script       src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com html5shiv 3.7.2 html5shiv.min.js">            <script       src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com respond 1.4.2 respond.min.js">               The preceding code is the standard Bootstrap header with some small changes:     Always load the Bootstrap CSS first, as you may want to overwrite   something in your theme Include the font awesome CSS file so that you can use the icons in   your projects Insert your theme CSS file, which will contain all your custom CSS          Make sure you use the CSS extension here for all your files. Once  theme.less is compiled, it will turn into theme.css. Therefore,  we need to name it correctly so that it's picked up by the browser.  Inserting the variables If you look at the   tag in  , you'll notice a couple of variables. These  are the two variables that we set up in _harp.json and _data.json. On compiling,  pageTitle and siteTitle will be inserted into the page layout. Depending on the  page, the proper pageTitle variable will be inserted.  Now that we have the   element of our layout set up, let's enter the code for   :                        [ 10 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     <script       src="  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.11.1 jquery.min. js">    <script src="js bootstrap.min.js"       type="text javascript">       Now, the   code is going to look a little different from what we are used to  with Bootstrap and HTML. Let me go through each part of the layout:     The header partial will include our header code, which we haven't set    up yet.  is inserted.     The yield tag is the marker for loading in the contents of our pages. In this   case, it will load index.ejs.     Like the header, the footer partial will be included wherever the tag       At the bottom, I've included jQuery and a link to the Bootstrap JavaScript   framework that is in our project.  Setting up the header To set up the header, we need to edit the _header.ejs file that we created earlier in  this chapter. Head to the  partial directory and open up _header.ejs. Then paste  the following in the Bootstrap navbar code:                    <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-          toggle="collapse" data-target="navbar1">          Toggle navigation                                                 <%- siteTitle          %>                        [ 11 ]  www.it-ebooks.info            Home                        The code for the header is pretty straightforward, except for one thing; it's your  standard Bootstrap navbar. One more thing that is different is that I've used the  siteTitle global variable again so that siteTitle will automatically be inserted  into the navbar brand for each page upon compilation. This is a simple example of  how you can reuse variables in your templates.  Setting up the footer Next, open up the _footer.ejs file, which is in the same  partial directory.  Here, we'll just want to insert some super simple footer code that can be used as  a placeholder. Notice how I'm wrapping my footer in a container-fluid class.  It's a good idea to componentize the pieces of your theme so that they are easily  interchangeable and don't rely on markup in other components or partials:                    &copy; 2015 Matt Lambert              As you can see, it is super simple! The last template or HTML EJS work that we  need to do is set up the body of our page, which lives inside of index.ejs. For our  boilerplate, let's create a super simple piece of page content:                     Bootstrap Boilerplate         This is a Bootstrap starter template built with Harp,           Less, CSS, EJS, and HTML         Made in Vancouver by <a           href="http:  twitter.com cardeo">@cardeo               [ 12 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This chunk of code should be self-explanatory. I've purposely kept it simple so that  you can easily see where the lines between page templates and partials are. Now that  the base of our project is set up, let's compile and preview it!  Compiling for the first time Now that our initial project is set up, it's time to compile it and test it out to make  sure that everything works. When we compile our project for the first time, Harp  creates a directory in the root of our project, called  www. Within this directory, it  will dump all the compiled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. When you are ready to  publish your project, simply upload the contents of this directory to your server. See  how simple and clean it is? Your development and production files live in the same  project directory but are totally separate.  You should never manually edit any of the files in your    www directory. If you do, on the next compilation, any  changes you make will be overwritten.  The compilation of your project is done from the command line or terminal app. If  you have closed it, open it again and navigate to your project directory. Once you get  there, run the following command:  $ harp compile  If all goes well, a new line should appear in the terminal. If there is an error, Harp  will give you an error message with a clue to the problem. Let's assume that all has  gone well and everything has worked fine. Go to your project directory and look for  the  www directory. If it's there, it means that the compile worked fine.  Running the local server The next thing you'll want to do is actually test your project in a browser. To do  this, we can use Harp's built-in web server to test the website locally. This is a great  feature because you can test drive your project locally without having to upload it to  the Internet. To fire up the server, enter the following command in the terminal from  your project directory:  $ harp server --port 9000  This will deploy your project locally on port 9000. Open up a web browser and go  to http:  localhost:9000 to view the website.  [ 13 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Your page should look like this:  Now that you have the server running, you can take advantage of one of Harp's  other awesome features. Every time you make a change to a template file, CSS file,  and so on, you don't have to recompile your project. You can simply save the file and  refresh the browser, and you'll see the updated version. This will save you so much  time! One thing to remember, however, is to make sure you compile when you're  done so that the changes are applied to the  www directory.  I encourage you to memorize the preceding commands, but if you want something  easier to remember, you can use $ harp server www to run the local server. The  only problem with this command, however, is that I've found it to be a bit buggy.  It will start the server but updates to templates in the background won't always be  picked up. A more reliable method is to manually declare which port to use when  you fire up the server. Now that our project is all set up and running, it's time to set  up our Less configuration to theme our project.  Configuring Less A great advantage of using Harp is that it has a built-in Less compiler. When you   run the $ harp compile command, it compiles both your .ejs templates and your  .less files into regular HTML and CSS. This is much easier than using something   like less.js, which you would have to remove from production. When you're  compiling your project for the first time, ensure that you include some code inside  your theme.less file. Otherwise, theme.css will not be written.  [ 14 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Defining your Less variables Head back to the css components directory that you created earlier and open up  the _variables.less file. Within this file, we'll configure what I call global CSS  variables. Moreover, within this file, we'll define only those variables that apply  across our entire website. Component-specific variables have no place in this file.  I know that some developers like to have one big file for variables, but I prefer to  keep the component-specific ones out in their own Less files. We will see more on  that later, when we dive into custom components. For now, let's start pasting the  following code in _variables.less.  Colors Let's start by inserting some color variables that can be used throughout all our  Bootstrap projects:  @black: 000;  @dark-grey: 333;  @grey: ccc;  @light-grey: ebebeb;  @off-white: f5f5f5;  @white: ffffff;  @blue1: 3498db;  @blue2: 2980b9;  @red1: e74c3c;  @red2: c0392b;  @yellow1: f1c40f;  @yellow2: f39c12;  @green1: 2ecc71;  @green2: 27ae60;  @orange1: e67e22;  @orange2: d35400;  @aqua1: 1abc9c;  @aqua2: 16a085;  @purple1: 9b59b6;  @purple2: 8e44ad;  @navy1: 34495e;  @navy2: 2c3e50;  As you'll see, I like to define a fairly large color palette. But this doesn't mean that all  my projects will use all of these colors. However, like a good typography, it's a good  idea over time to develop a library of colors that work well together. We can then  easily include them in all our projects so that we have colors that work well together  right at our fingertips. When you are diving deep into theming, this is really valuable  because you don't have to go and look for a new color palette with every new theme.  You already have a collection of colors that you can pull from, which will speed up  your theming process.  [ 15 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Backgrounds Lets add the background variables:  @primary-background: @white;  @secondary-background: @off-white;  @third-background: @light-grey;  @fourth-background: @grey;  @inverse-background: @dark-grey;  The preceding code is my boilerplate for backgrounds. Note how these  colors use a variable name for their value and not a hexadecimal value.  The reason that this is done is to speed up theming. Instead of having  to change a color in two places, we only have to change it in one, and  then it inherits throughout our other variables. Here are a few more  key points about backgrounds. The variable naming convention here is similar to that of Bootstrap,  for consistency. This also makes it easier to remember a variable name,  such as primary, as against something like white-background. At the very least, you should have a primary, a secondary, and an  inverse background. I like to include a couple more, but feel free to  scale this back a bit if it makes it easier for you.  Text As with our backgrounds, we are following the Bootstrap naming conventions for  our text colors:  @primary-text: @dark-grey;  @light-text: @light-grey;  @loud-text: @black;  @inverse-text: @white;  @heading-text: @dark-grey;  Consistency is the key as it makes it easier to remember variable names. It is critical  when you're dealing with a large framework that you make things as easy as  possible to remember. Again, make sure you use color variables for the values here  and not actual hexadecimal numbers.  Links Defining the link colors is pretty straightforward:  @primary-link-color: @blue1;  @primary-link-color-hover: @blue2;  [ 16 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   One thing that I'll point out here is that this is the first example where you'll see why  you should have at least two versions of every color that you use in your palette.  Things such as hover states usually require a base color and a darker or lighter  version of the same color to indicate a change in hovering. You may want to expand  this section to include a second or even third-link color variation.  Borders The border variable is the first place where you'll see some values that aren't only  color-based:  In this case, you should always set your size to 1px. The reason for this is that you  can use a Less operation like the following to increase the size of your border.  Starting from 1px makes your operations simple and easy to follow for other  developers who may be maintaining or editing your code:  @border-color: @light-grey;  @border-size: 1px;  @border-type: solid;  @border-focus: @grey;  @secondary-border-color: @blue1;  .good-class {   border-size:  @border-size + 1 ; }  .bad-class {   border-size: 2px; }  Never use pixel values in any of your custom CSS! You would  want to use variables so that you can make any units relative and,  therefore, controlled by a variable. This will allow you to quickly  spin up a new theme by only editing the variable's Less file.  Typography Next we need to setup the global settings for our typography variables. We'll set our  body and heading font stacks, a base font size and line height.  @body-copy: "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;  @heading-copy: "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans- serif;  @base-font-size: 14px;  @font-size: 1em;  @base-line-height: 1.5;  [ 17 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When I set up typography for a theme, I like to follow a few simple rules:     Make sure you define at least a body and a heading copy variable.    Set the base font size as a pixel value.    Set the actual font size to 1em and use this variable throughout your custom   CSS. In this way, you will be using a relative value that is easier with  operations. This is exactly the same as the preceding border example. I personally prefer to reset Bootstrap's line-height to 1.5 for easier math.      Layout The only layout variables that you should be setting in your globals are margin and  padding:  @margin: 1em;  @padding: 1em;  Both should be set to 1em for easy relative operations. This follows the same unit of  measurement patterns set with borders and typography.  Mixins The other element that I recommend including in your global Less file is mixins. In  my opinion, there are only two of them  and maybe only one  that you definitely  need to include to speed up your Bootstrap theming.  Border radius The border radius is by far the most important as it is used a ton through Bootstrap  components:  .round-corners  @radius: 2px  {    -moz-border-radius: @radius;    -ms-border-radius: @radius;    border-radius: @radius;  }  Make sure you set this up and use it for everything. If you are thorough, you can  change the border radius of all elements in one place. An example of this would   look like the following:  .btn {    * fill in the rest of the styles here *   [ 18 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     .round-corners; }  Now, if I change my @radius value to a different pixel amount, it will inherit down  to my button corners. Do this for all your Bootstrap components!  Animations and transitions Another property that I use heavily in my themes is the animations or transitions  property:  .transition  @transition: background .1s linear  {    -moz-transition: @transition;    -webkit-transition: @transition;    transition: background @transition;  }  I find that a little transition, when added, can add a lot to a UI. Instead of defining  this from the ground up on every component, use this simple mixin. It will speed up  your theming time and also ensure that transitions are consistent across your entire  theme. That's just good design and coding. Here's an example that shows you how   to apply the round corners and transition mixins to a button:  .btn {    * fill in the rest of the styles here *    .round-corners;   .transition; }  This completes your _variables.less file. Save the file and close it. Next, we'll  cover the setup of the master theme file for our project.  Setting up your theme Now that we've set up our variables file, we need to set up the master theme that  we'll import it into. The master theme file, or theme.less, is the primary file that  we will link in the   section of our pages. I've organized the theme using the  Scalable and Modular CSS  SMACSS  system. Using a modular approach while  coding the CSS will make the job easier and the code more maintainable over time.  [ 19 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   SMACSS overview The scalable and modular CSS system was created by Jonathan Snook, who is  currently a product manager at Shopify. It divides your style sheet into five sections  in order to make it easier to categorize your CSS. Let's review each SMACSS category  to see how it applies to our Bootstrap theme structure.  Base rules A base rule applies to any element that is an element selector, descendent selector,  child selector, or pseudo-class. It doesn't apply to CSS classes or IDs. These are  basically all your core HTML tags.  Layout rules The layout section is dedicated to any custom classes that you've written for  the layout of your project. This could be something simple, such as a header, or  something more complex, such as a widget. If you're following best practices, your  layout should only use classes. However, if you have used some IDs, you should  include them here as well.  Module rules This is the big one for Bootstrap, because this is where you should import all your  component Less files. Later on, I'll explain how you should break down each  Bootstrap component into its own Less file and then import it into the master theme.  The code for this will look a little something like the following:  @import "components _badges.less"; @import "components _typography.less"; @import "components _tables.less";  State rules These styles refer to anything that applies to a state change, such as form validation  or alert bars.  Theme rules This part of your style sheet is optional. You may cover it in the preceding sections.  However, if you find yourself needing a section for styles specific to your theme, this  is where you should insert them.  [ 20 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now that I've explained how we'll organize our master theme, let's actually start  putting it together. The first thing we need to do is import the _variables.less file  that we created. We want this to be the first thing that we load into the theme, so we  place the following line of code at the top:  @import "components _variables";  With the variables file in Harp, you shouldn't include the file  extension. The reason behind this is that multiple preprocessor  types are supported and variables is a keyword.  Setting up the base The next section that we want to set up in our theme is the base. Insert the following  boilerplate CSS. We want to keep this really basic so that we have a starting point for  our future projects:  body {   background: @primary-background;   font-family: @body-copy;   font-size: @base-font-size;   line-height: @base-line-height;   color: @primary-text;  }  ul, ol { }  li { }  p { }  hr { }  a, a:link, a:visited { }  a:hover { }  [ 21 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I'm not even going to fill in any of the tags at this point, as they will be defined in the  actual project. The only tag I will fill in is  . Let's review the properties that we  have added to the body tag at the top of the preceding section of code:     We'll set our background to the @primary-background variable. The @  primary-background variable should be set to the color you want for the  background of your project.     We set the font-family property to our @body-copy variable.    Set the font-size property to the @base-font-size variable. Remember  that this is the one that has the pixel value, and it should be a value of this  type on the body tag. In any future use of the font-size property, you  should use the @font-size variable.     The line-height is set using the @base-line-height variable.    Finally, we'll set the font color to our @primary-text variable.  As I mentioned earlier, we'll leave the rest of this section blank as it will be filled in to  match the actual project that we will be designing in the future.  Setting up the layout Since this is a boilerplate project, we don't really have a layout. We can fall back on  the Bootstrap's grid and we don't need anything custom. Therefore, just leave this  section blank for now, but you might want to insert a comment to show where the  layout code should be inserted for future projects:   * 02. LAYOUT Styles specific to your layout or website *   Setting up the modules This section should be a list of @import keywords that load into our Less component  files. As I mentioned earlier, you should break down any custom Bootstrap  component CSS into its own Less file and save it in the  components directory. This  is the way to keep your CSS neat and tidy in the development version of your theme.  On compile, all of these Less files will be combined into a single CSS file called  theme.css. However, for development purposes, it makes a ton of sense to break  down the CSS for easier maintenance and writing.  [ 22 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As you create a project, you may not need to overwrite code in every Bootstrap  component. Personally, I think it's good practice to customize everything, but it's not  always practical to do this. The following is a list of potential Less component files  that you can make with Bootstrap:     badges    breadcrumbs    buttons    button groups    button dropdowns    carousel    code    collapse    dropdown    forms    icons    input groups    images    helpers    jumbotron    labels    The list group    The media object    modal    navs    navbar    pager    The page header    pagination    panels    pills  [ 23 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      popover    progress bars    scrollspy    tables    tabs    thumbnails    tooltip    typography    well  When you're creating a component Less file, first save it at css components, and  then use the @import keyword to import it into theme.less. You need a different   @import statement for each file to load it in:  @import "components _badges.less"; @import "components _typography.less"; @import "components _tables.less";  Setting up the states With Bootstrap, the States section works much like modules, but I like to divide the  following two components into the states section:  @import "components _alerts.less"; @import "components _form-validation.less";  These two make sense from a Bootstrap component standpoint. If you are using   a different JavaScript library to perform your form validation, you should include  the corresponding styles here. This should also apply for any component that has   a state change.  Setting up the theme The final section is the theme, and it is totally optional. One thing that would be  theme-specific is your color palette. I break my color palette into another Less file  and import it under the modules section.  [ 24 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You may be wondering what goes into this colors.less file, since we have  defined our colors in the _variables.less file. In the variables file, we only assign  hexadecimal numbers to variables. In the colors.less file, I assign these variable  names to actual CSS classes so that we can use them in our layouts. In this way, we  stay more modular because we can assign a color class to a widget instead of putting  the color in the widget's CSS layout code. I usually define a text and background  color class for each color in my palette:  .red1 {   color: @red1; }  .red1-bg {   background: @red1; }  .red2 {   color: @red2; }  .red2-bg {   background: @red2; }  Now, those class names are way easier to remember than hexadecimal numbers, and  this allows you to apply them to a widget, as follows:   this is a custom box with a red  background   Using this method, I can leave out any color styles in my custom-box class and only  worry about layout styles. I can then apply the color using a CSS class, which is  much more modular and reusable.  Finishing up theme.less Now that we've finished the last section of theme.less, our style sheet is ready  to roll. Go back to the terminal and compile your project again. Once that's done,  go to www css and you should see theme.css. Our boilerplate CSS development  environment is ready to roll for an actual project.  [ 25 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, you learned how to—and why it's important to—build a  development environment with Harp.js. You also learned how to write templates   in EJS using variables and partials. Lastly, you got to know how to set up your   theme with Less and compile your project for production.  In the next chapter, we'll begin our first project, where we'll build a full-fledged  restaurant website. Eager to get started? Flip those pages and dive right in!  [ 26 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a Restaurant Website  In the previous chapter, we laid down the foundation that will be used in all our  blueprints moving forward. In the second chapter, we'll use our Harp.js development  environment and build an actual restaurant website. This will include building more  page templates, introducing Google Web Fonts, customizing Bootstrap components,  and much more. But before we jump right into it by expanding on the files we set up   in the first chapter, let's preview the home page for our new restaurant website:  [ 27 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building our development environment In the first chapter, we kept our Harp.js development environment pretty basic.  We did this because we want to be able to use it as a boilerplate for all our projects.  The first thing that we need to do in this chapter is expand on our original work to  customize and extend it for our restaurant website.  Adding more pages Now, the first thing we should do is update _data.json with all the new pages that  we'll be building for our restaurant website. Along with our home page, let's add  three new pages: Menu, About, and Contact. Our file should look like this:  {   "index": {     "pageTitle": "Home"   },   "menu": {     "pageTitle": "Menu"   },   "about": {     "pageTitle": "About"   },   "contact": {     "pageTitle": "Contact"   } }  As you can see, I've added three new sections to our JSON file. Make sure you name  your files to match the first part. Then, I've defined a pageTitle value for each page.  Save the file and close it.  The _harp.json doesn't require any updates for this project.  Expanding the layout We need to make a couple of additions to _layout.ejs for our restaurant website.  We're going to load a secondary web icon font library and some Google Web Fonts.  [ 28 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding Google Web Fonts I don't want our restaurant website to look like every other Bootstrap website, so  I'm going to import some Google Web Fonts to give it a more original look. If you're  unfamiliar with this service, remember that it's an open source library of web fonts  provided for free from Google. You can even download the actual font files on your  computer for use in programs such as Photoshop or Illustrator. For this project, I've  selected the Raleway font and I'll need four weights: light  300 , normal  400 , bold   700 , and ultra-bold  900 . To import the fonts, simply add this line of code to the    tag of _layout.ejs:  <link   href='  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Raleway:400,300,700,900'   rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>  Now that we've imported the fonts from Google's CDN, we need to hook them  up in our Less theme. Pop open the _variables.less component located at css  components. Locate the Typography section of the file and add Raleway as the first  option in your font stack:  @body-copy: "Raleway", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial,   verdana, sans-serif; @heading-copy: "Raleway", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial,   verdana, sans-serif;  Now our fonts are all set to use Raleway. In the current configuration, Raleway  will be the only font used across the entire website. In some cases, you might want  to use something like Helvetica Neue for the body copy and Raleway for the  heading copy. If that's the case, just remove Raleway from the @body-copy variable.  However, for my design, I'm going to use Raleway for both copy types.  Our updates to _layout.ejs are now complete. The entire file should look like this:                  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-      scale=1">             <link type="text css" href="css bootstrap.min.css"       rel="stylesheet">   <link type="text css" href="css font-awesome.min.css"       rel="stylesheet">  [ 29 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         <link     href='  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Raleway:400,300,700,900'         rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>    <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements       and media queries -->   <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via       file:   -->         <script   src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com html5shiv 3.7.2 html5shiv.min.js"><  script>     <script   src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com respond 1.4.2 respond.min.js">                                <script       src="  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.11.1 jquery.min. js">    <script src="js bootstrap.min.js"       type="text javascript">       Updating the Less variables Before we go any further with this project, we should update a few of the global  variables to match the look and feel of our restaurant website.  [ 30 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Backgrounds I'm going to change the primary background to be light gray and the secondary  background to be white. The main background of the website will be light gray. It  will have a centered section that holds the majority of the content, which will be  white for easy readability:     background colors @primary-background: @off-white; @secondary-background: @white;  Links I'm also going to move away from the default Bootstrap link colors by setting them  to red. The basic color palette for our website will be white, light grey, dark grey,   and red:     link colors  @primary-link-color: @red1; @primary-link-color-hover: @red2;  That's all the updates that our global variables will need. Let's move on to editing  our header, which will require us to write some new CSS in our theme.   Updating the header The next thing that we need to update is the header partial. Open up _header.ejs,  located in the  partial directory. Select the contents of the file and delete them all.  For this project, it's going to be easier to create custom header navigation instead  of using Bootstrap's. When creating Bootstrap websites or themes, it's important to  remember that you don't have to use all the native components. This is actually a  good way to avoid a generic-looking Bootstrap website. This is also a technique that  you will start to see throughout this book, for creating a unique look and feel. Here's  the code for our new header:                               Public                                                      Home    [ 31 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                 Menu                                 About                                 Contact                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default"                 data-toggle="modal" data-target="reservation-                  modal">Reservations                                              As you can see, I may not be using the default Bootstrap navbar component, but I'm  still using the basic grid classes to build a new custom header. Let's go through each  part and talk about the custom CSS that goes with it.  The first thing that I've done is added a wrapping class around a container so that I  can apply some styles to this specific chunk of layout. Let's update theme.less by  adding the following styles:  .header .container {   background: @primary-background;   padding-left: 0;   padding-right: 0; }  In a future step, we're going to set our default container to use our secondary- background variable, which is white. However, for this header, we want the  background to be light gray, so we'll set it to the @primary-background variable. We  also want the text in our header to line up vertically with our layout box, so we've  removed the left and right padding.  I'm a big supporter of minimal layouts with lots of white space, so let's add some  vertical padding to our header to give it some breathing room:  .header {   padding:  @padding * 4  0; }  [ 32 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I've used a Less operation here to render the padding value. Instead of writing  something like 4em, I've used  @padding * 4 . This is very powerful because we  can control the overall global padding values from our global Less variables. In our  actual theme, we are simply creating a relative measurement. This will save you a  ton of time. You don't need to go through your entire theme while making edits; you  can simply update the variables file. I hope it's clearer now why we set the margin  and padding to 1em. It makes doing the math in your head super easy when you   are multiplying, adding, dividing, or subtracting from a base value of 1.  Setting up the page title The next thing that I'll do is set up the page title with a   to optimize it for SEO.  For this tag, we're going to write some custom CSS to change the font size and use  our Google web font. I'll also use this as an example to create a new Less component.  Open a new file and save it to the css components folder with the filename as   _typography.less. We're going to break all of our custom type out into its own Less  component file, which we will then import back into theme.less. This keeps our  Less files small and easier to read. Once you've created the file, paste the following  code in it:  h1 {   font-weight: 900;   height: 36px;   margin: 0;   line-height: 1; }  Remember that we're using the Raleway web font, so I'm setting font-weight to a  value of 900 to apply the ultra-bold font option. I've also changed the font size to  36px, removed the margin and set line-height to 1. The reason I've normalized  these values is that this will make it easier to line up the page title with the nav links  unordered list, which we haven't added yet.  Before we can apply these styles, we need to import _typography.less back into  theme.less. Head back to that file and scroll down to the modules section of the file.  Once you're there, insert the following line of code to import the type component file.  @import "components _typography.less";  That's all we need to do for the page title. For the purposes of the project, I've named  the restaurant public. Feel free to keep this name or rename it to something else.  The next step is to set up the navigation component.  [ 33 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up the navigation You'll notice that I've set up a custom div to wrap an inline list named main-nav.  What I'm doing here is using Bootstrap's built-in inline list component and then  building on it a bit more to get the look that I want. This is the power of using  a framework. I don't have to write the whole unordered list component; I can  use what is provided and customize it. The main-nav component has a few CSS  customizations, so let's jump into them all:  .main-nav {   line-height: 36px;    vertical center with logo }  The first thing that we'll do is set line-height to 36px, which matches the height of  the public page title. This will vertically center the page title and the navigation. It's  basically a quick and easy way to apply vertical centering in CSS:  Next, we'll remove the bottom margin from the   tag to maintain the same  vertical alignment. If we were to leave that in, then it would push the next container  down and ruin our nice equal space above and below our header, which we set   to 4ems:  .main-nav ul {   margin-bottom: 0; }  .main-nav li.divider {   color: @grey; }  You'll notice that in our unordered list, every other   tag has a class of .divider.  This is a quick and easy way to add a little design element to your nav to make it  look different. I've styled the color of these dividers to be a bit lighter so that they're  an accent and don't clash with the page links, which are the main thing that we want  your user to notice:  .main-nav a {   text-decoration: none; }  The last thing we need to cover is the appearance of the links in our navigation.   For our static state, I've simply removed the underline. On hover of the link,   things get a little more interesting:  .main-nav a:hover {   border-bottom:  @border-size * 5  @border-type @grey;   transition: border-color 0.2s ease; }  [ 34 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I've used a CSS3 transition to fade in the border bottom color of each link. I've also  increased the border size to five pixels, using a Less operation, to make it stand out  more. This is purely a design element, so feel free to play around with it to get the  effect you want.  Setting up the reservations modal The last part of the header and navigation is the Reservations button. Clicking on  this button will launch a modal popup where the user can fill in and submit a form  to request a reservation at the restaurant. We'll need to insert our button into our  header. Then, the corresponding modal code will have to be inserted into every   page template. Here's what the modal will look like:  Next, let's start with the code for the button:  <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="modal"  data-target="reservation-modal">  There's nothing out of the ordinary here. Just be sure to note the data-target value,  or ID, as we'll need it when we set up our modal code in the page template.  Once we've inserted our button, we need to open up index.ejs and insert the  modal code, which will be executed once the button is clicked on. Paste the following  snippet of code in your index file. I prefer to insert my modal code at the bottom of  the file so that it doesn't confuse other developers.   [ 35 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Make sure that you also comment what the modal is for:                                <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"             aria-label="Close"><span aria-              hidden="true">&times;            Book Reservation                                                     Name              <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Enter your name">                                      Date              <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Enter your date">                                      Guests              <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Enter the number of guests">                                               <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-            dismiss="modal">Close          <button type="button" class="btn btn-            primary">Submit                          [ 36 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's review the key parts of this modal for reservations:          In the first line of the modal code, make sure that the CSS ID matches the  data-target that was entered on the button code in the previous step. In  this case, it should be reservation-modal. If you change the name, make  sure that it is something descriptive, as we'll be adding more modals on the  menu page. Insert the code for a basic form in the modal-body, and you're done. If you  save the file and fire up the Harp.js server, you can test out the header and  the modal. On a click of the reservations button, the modal should launch  over the top of your page.  This concludes the setup of the header for this project. Before we jump into page  templates, let's set up the global footer.  Setting up the footer The last part of our base template that we need to update is the footer. We're going   to give the footer a unique new look, use some Font Awesome social media icons,  and define our first utility CSS classes.  The footer layout First, open up _footer.ejs, which is located in the  partial directory. Delete the  existing code in there and replace it with the following snippet:                     Public         1234 Street Name   Vancouver, BC   604.123.1234         Hours: Open 12pm to 9pm 7 days a week                                                                             &copy; 2015 Public Restaurant               [ 37 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Like our header, I've wrapped the footer section in a .footer class so that I can  target all of the code within it. The first thing that we'll do is set up the following  styles on the wrapping class:  .footer {   text-align: center;   color: @inverse-text;   padding-bottom:  @padding * 4 ; }  I'm using the @inverse-text variable here to set the text to white. In the next step,  the background color will be reversed, so that's why we are also reversing the text  color. I've also added some bottom padding to the footer and centered the contents   of the section.  If you prefer, you can choose to use the   HTML5 tag here  instead of a .footer class.  Next, we need to make some customizations to the .container class, which   is nested inside of .footer. As with our header, we'll want to customize this  container without affecting the primary container used in the body of the page:  .footer .container {   background: @inverse-background;   padding:  @padding * 4  0; }  Here, I've used the @inverse-background variable to reverse the background footer  color. I've also applied some top and bottom padding to the section.  Now that we've set up our wrapping styles, we can go through the actual HTML  code for our footer. First off, we've reused our   tag and added in the name of  the restaurant. Following that, we add in the address and hours of operation for the  restaurant. All that is straightforward. The next section is the social media icons,  which will require some special styles. First of all, we'll add some vertical padding  around the icons to give them some breathing space:     add padding around social media links .social-media {   padding: @padding 0; }  [ 38 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, we'll set up some custom link states for the icons. The default red links would  be a bit loud here, so we'll go with a more subtle light gray treatment. I've also added  some horizontal padding to each icon link for additional breathing room:     space out social media icons and change link color .social-media a {   padding: 0  @padding - 0.5 ;   color: @white; }     hover link color for social media icons .social-media a:hover {   color: @grey; }  You may have noticed that the HTML for the icons is using some new classes. These  are the Font Awesome icons that we set up in our header. As I mentioned, the  Glyphicon library that comes with Bootstrap doesn't provide social media icons,   so we've also added them in Font Awesome:                       That's it for our footer. We've now finished expanding all the template files that we  created in Chapter 1, Advanced Bootstrap Development Tools. In the next step, we'll work  on customizing index.ejs and build the home page of our restaurant website.  [ 39 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Home page The home page for the restaurant website will be split into four main parts: a  primary image banner, an "about the restaurant" statement, a few food thumbnails  that will link to our menu page, and a Bootstrap reviews carousel. Here's what the  page that we'll be creating will look like:  [ 40 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the primary header image We're going to set up some reusable styles for this image banner, which will be present  across multiple pages of the website. Here's the code for the home page banner:                          <img src="img banner.jpg" width="1170" height="500"             alt="Public Restaurant Banner">                    The primary image for the design will stretch the entire width of the layout. The  problem is that Bootstrap provides some padding here by default. Using the  .public-banner class, we'll remove that default padding:     here - allows image to go right to the edge .public-banner .col-lg-12 {   padding-left: 0;   padding-right: 0; }  We also need to add a couple of styles to the primary header image so it will look  correct on mobile devices. The actual image is larger than the default container size,  but width is set to 100%, so it fills the width of the container. The height property is  set to auto, so the image will automatically resize at smaller screen resolutions:  .public-banner img {   width: 100%;   height: auto; }  Now we'll insert the actual image into our layout with the following line of code:  <img src="img banner.jpg" width="1170" height="500" alt="Public   Restaurant Banner">  We provide some set dimensions here so that our HTML code will validate.  However, this is just a starting point. The image will automatically resize depending  on the viewport size. The first part of our home page is done; the next thing that we'll  cover is the About text section.  [ 41 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the about text to the home page Let's add the About text section. This is a place to add a tagline or a quick description  about the restaurant. Here's what the code looks like:                                       About                                           Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus                   et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis                     egestas.                                                         You'll notice that this section has a wrapping class called .home-about. This is  similar to the approach we took with the header and footer. I'm reusing this   pattern because I want to apply some padding to the section of the text in the   about section:     add some padding around the about headline .home-about {   padding:  @padding * 4  0  @padding * 6  0; }  For the actual text in this section, I don't want it to stretch the width of the layout,   so I'll get a little creative with the Bootstrap grid. Consider the following code:       Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et       malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.     I'd like the width of the text column to be half the width of the layout, so I'll use   the .col-lg-6 grid class. To center the text column in the layout, I'll use the offset  class .col-lg-offset-3. Using the offset class, I can now center my paragraph   in the layout.  [ 42 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up the food tiles The next part of this page is the four food tiles that show some featured restaurant  items. Each of these images will be a link that leads to our menu page. Here's what  the code for the section looks like:                                      <img src="img food-feature1.jpg" width="250"               height="250" alt="Food Feature 1">                    Sandwich                                      <img src="img food-feature2.jpg" width="250"               height="250" alt="Food Feature 2">                    Dessert                                      <img src="img food-feature3.jpg" width="250"               height="250" alt="Food Feature 3">                    Salad                                      <img src="img food-feature4.jpg" width="250"               height="250" alt="Food Feature 4">                    Coffee                     Again I've wrapped the section in its own class; this time, it is called .home-food.  You're likely seeing a pattern emerge here of wrapping sections in their own classes.  This is a good practice to follow as it allows you to componentize sections of a  page. This will make it easier to apply specific styles to these sections if needed.  You should strive to avoid being too specific in your CSS, but sometimes it will be  necessary to get the look and feel you are going for.   [ 43 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In this case, we're going to use the wrapping class to center everything within it:     center all items .home-food {   text-align: center; }  The second customization that we want to add to this section is the application of  some bottom padding to each of the images. Since we have the wrapping class, it's  easy to target the contained images without worrying about negatively affecting  other images on our page:     add a little extra padding under images .home-food img {   padding-bottom: @padding; }  The rest of the code here is basic Bootstrap grid code, and it should be easy to  decipher. If you need a refresher, check out the complete code for the preceding  section.  Adding the review carousel The final piece for this page will be a review carousel. Using this component here  allows you to add multiple social proof examples for the website in a slick-looking  execution. Here's the code for the carousel:                                         Reviews            <div id="carousel-reviews" class="carousel slide" data-              ride="carousel">                                           <li data-target="carousel-reviews" data-slide-                  to="0" class="active">                <li data-target="carousel-reviews" data-slide-                  to="1">                <li data-target="carousel-reviews" data-slide-                  to="2">                 [ 44 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                                                This is the best sandwich I've ever had! I                     Highly recommend trying the chicken sandwich                       for lunch.                                                   The desserts are to die for. Make sure you                     save enough room after you eat your dinner.                                                   They have some of the best locally brewed                     coffee I have ever tasted. So fresh and eye                       opening early in the morning.                                                           <a class="left carousel-control" href="carousel-                reviews" role="button" data-slide="prev">               <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"                   aria-hidden="true">                 Previous                            <a class="right carousel-control" href="carousel-                reviews" role="button" data-slide="next">               <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"                   aria-hidden="true">                 Next                                                         Like all our previous sections, I've wrapped this one in a class called .reviews. I'll  simply use this class to add some vertical padding around the review carousel:     add review padding consistent with about .reviews {   padding:  @padding * 4  0  @padding * 6  0; }  [ 45 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   From here on, the rest of the HTML is stock Bootstrap markup. I've added in some  of my own made-up reviews to give you an idea. What we need to do, however,  is customize the look and feel of this component so that it matches our website's  design. In this case, we are going to customize a Bootstrap component, so we'll create  another component Less file to hold the styles. First things first, create a new Less file  called _carousel.less and save it in the css components directory. Next, import  that file into theme.less with the following line of code:  @import "components _carousel.less";  Now that we've imported our file, we need to add in some custom styles. Let's go  through each declaration, explaining what it does:  .carousel .item {   padding: @padding  @padding * 12   @padding * 4   @padding * 12 ;   font-size:  @font-size * 1.5 ; }  The first thing that we'll do is add some padding to the carousel. I don't want the text  to stretch the width of the layout, so I'll add some generous horizontal padding to  condense the paragraph size. Next, I want to increase font-size 1.5 times so that   the reviews are nice and easy to read:  .carousel-control.right, .carousel-control.left {   background-image: none; }  a.carousel-control {   color: @light-grey; }  The default Bootstrap carousel has a gradient behind the left and right sides of the  carousel on hover. I personally don't like this treatment as I'm more of a minimalist.  The preceding snippet of CSS will remove the default gradient:  Now that we've removed the background gradient, the CSS that you just saw will  change the color of the carousel arrows to match the new color scheme. Little things  like this might seem tedious, but they are the small details that will make your  website look unique and not like a generic Bootstrap website:  .carousel-indicators li {   border: @border-size @border-color @border-type; }  [ 46 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This declaration is about consistency. Let's simply reset the borders on the carousel  indicators to use our border variables' names and values. We do this so that if we  change the global variable's value, it will automatically be picked up through the  component. This saves us the effort of coming to the actual component CSS to make  an edit:  .carousel-indicators .active {   background: @light-grey; }  The last step is to change the color of the indicators to match the left right arrow  colors. Consistency is the name of the game, and paying attention to these little  details will take your website from good to great. But your home page is not  complete!

This page will feature  a two-column layout and some custom text styles to give it a unique look. Here's a  screenshot of what we'll be building:  [ 51 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Changing the feature image The first thing that we need to do is create a new file called about.ejs. Next, we'll  change the feature image as displayed in the preceding screenshot. To do this, we'll  simply update this image line of code:  <img src="img banner-about.jpg" width="1170" height="500"   alt="Public Restaurant About Banner">  Make sure you update the alt text to optimize your image for search results. The  next thing we need to do is set up our two-column layout. I'm going to wrap a    with a class of .page-body around the row, as we've done in the past:  This will allow us to apply some padding around our main page body:     .page-body {   padding:  @padding * 4 ; }  I do this to add some whitespace and give the layout room to breathe.  Setting up the large subtitle Let's start with the column on the left first, and we'll set up the oversized subtitle  with the following line of code:   Great food, great people, good times.   We're using the   tag here; I've applied a class of .large to it. This class is a  reusable utility that you can add to any text tag to increase its size four times. Open  up the type component named _typography.less in css components and add in  the following styles:  h2 {   font-weight: 900; }  .large {   font-size:  @font-size * 4 ; }  Now you can see how I've set up the .large class to multiply font-size by 4. I've  also changed the font weight of the   tag to 900, which will trigger the heaviest  weight of our Google web font that we previously imported.  [ 52 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the social media icons For the About page, I think it's important to move the links to the restaurant's social  media profiles more to the forefront. We can also combine them with our large  headline to create a nice visual element without the use of any images, thus creating  a nice, lightweight effect. Let's reuse the social media icon code that we set up in our  footer, as follows:                                   Note that there is one small but critical difference in this code compared to the footer,  which is the class name on the wrapping  . In this case, I've applied a class  called .about-social-media. It's a great practice to reuse our HTML code and   then simply apply some different styling to it with a new class name:  .about-social-media {   margin:  @margin * 2  0;   font-size:  @font-size * 2 ; }  For these icons, I'm going to apply top and bottom margins to give them some  vertical space. I'm also going to increase the font size a bit so that they stand   out more.  Adding the address The last part of the left-hand-side column is a repetition of the restaurant's address.  No special classes here, but I'm using the   tag to give this section a unique  look, like this:            Public Restaurant      1234 Street Name      Vancouver, BC      604.123.1234        [ 53 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I'm using a simple   tag here with a number of line breaks to create the text layout.  You may want to use an unordered list with the list-unstyled class, but that is a  little more code heavy.  This completes the left column. Let's move on to the right column in the next step.  Reviewing the layout Before we jump to the next column, we should review the layout code. Here's the  code for the two columns:       left col     right col     You'll notice that I haven't divided the columns into two equal widths. I've followed  this layout for two reasons:          I want to use an asymmetric layout. Uneven layouts are more pleasing to  the eye and will give your design some personality. Wherever possible, you  should always shoot to create asymmetric layouts. This is a rule taken from  the print design world that, when used properly in web design, can create a  very nice-looking layout. I want to provide some extra horizontal space between my two columns.  As we've done with the vertical space, it can be nice to give our text some  horizontal breathing space. This makes the text easier to read and breathes  some life into your layout. Following some simple design tips like this will  also prevent your website from looking like a generic Bootstrap site.  Inserting the About text Now that we've set up our layout, it's a simple exercise to insert our text. Here's my  code for this:   Our Story   Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et   malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam,   feugiat vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu   libero sit amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae   est. Mauris placerat eleifend leo.   Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et   malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam,   feugiat vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu   libero sit amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae    [ 54 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   est. Mauris placerat eleifend leo. Quisque sit amet est et sapien   ullamcorper pharetra. Vestibulum erat wisi, condimentum sed,   commodo vitae, ornare sit amet, wisi. Aenean fermentum, elit eget   tincidunt condimentum, eros ipsum rutrum orci, sagittis tempus   lacus enim ac dui. Donec non enim in turpis pulvinar facilisis.   Ut felis. Praesent dapibus, neque id cursus faucibus, tortor   neque egestas augue, eu vulputate magna eros eu erat. Aliquam   erat volutpat. Nam dui mi, tincidunt quis, accumsan porttitor,   facilisis luctus, metus   You'll notice that I'm using some header tags here, specifically   and  . Again,  taking the time to use some other text tags will give your design some life and  differentiate it from regular Bootstrap sites. I've also customized the   tag   a bit to give it a different look:  h3 {   font-weight: 700;   color: @red1; }  h4 {   line-height: 1.5 }  I've upped font-weight to 700, or bold, and I've applied one of our Less color  variables  @red1 in this case  to change the color of the header tag. I've also   made a small change to the   tag:  By default, header tags in Bootstrap are set to 1.1 for the line-height property. The  reason for this is that headers are usually on one line only, so you don't necessarily  want to add a ton of extra vertical spacing. However, in this case, I'm using an    across multiple lines, so I want to increase line-height to match the default for   my regular paragraphs of text. Otherwise, the   text will be cramped and too  hard to read.  Don't forget the modal The last thing that we need to do for this page is copy and paste the reservation  modal code at the bottom. If we leave this out, our reservation modal won't work on  the About page. If I were smart, I would actually drop this modal code into a new  partial and then just import it into the page. In that way, we only have to manage  one reservation modal component. Why don't we do that right now? Take the  following code and create a new file at  partial called _reservation-modal.ejs:       [ 55 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                             <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"             aria-label="Close"><span aria-              hidden="true">&times;            Book Reservation                                                     Name              <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Enter your name">                                      Date              <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Enter your date">                                      Guests              <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Enter the number of guests">                                               <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-            dismiss="modal">Close          <button type="button" class="btn btn-            primary">Submit                          Once you've saved the file, go back to about.ejs and paste this line of code at the  very bottom of your file:     [ 56 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Recompiling your project Now is a great time to talk about recompiling your project. One of the great things  about Harp is that it will pick up changes as you make them and display them in the  browser. However, if you make a significant change, such as adding a new partial,  it's a good idea to recompile your code. The best practice would be to recompile after  each new page that you create. You'll want to make sure that you test each page as  you go. If you have a typo in your filename, it will throw an error in the terminal  until you correct it. It's easier to do this one page at a time compared to trying to  figure out which page is wrong once you've created ten of them. Anyhow, head back  to your command-line tool and stop the web server by hitting Ctrl + C. Next enter  the Harp compile command again:  $ harp compile  If all is good, you shouldn't see any errors. If you do see an error, make sure you  check the page filename against what you entered in the _data.json file. Most of the  time, it will be a simple typo here that needs to be corrected to get your production  site to compile properly again. After you've completed your compile, fire up the  server again, as follows:  $ harp server –port 9000  Then head back to your browser and refresh the About page. Click on the  Reservations button in the header and the modal should launch. You're now using a  partial to import a chunk of code that is reused across multiple pages. This is one of  the awesome parts of Harp! This concludes the design and coding of the About page. Next, let's tackle one of the  most important pages of our restaurant website—the menu!

The following is a preview of   what the page will look like:  [ 59 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As you can see, I've kept the layout pretty minimal, which is my style and will  transfer well to the mobile view. Let's start by going over the page header style   that is used for each section of the menu.  Customizing the .page-header class For each section of the menu, I'm using a   tag with the Bootstrap .page-header  class to make it stand out. Here's what the code looks like:   Appetizers   Since we don't want our site to look like a generic Bootstrap project, I'm going to  customize the look and feel of the page-header component:  .page-header {   padding-bottom:  @padding * 1.5 ;   margin: @margin 0;   border-bottom:  @border-size * 5  @border-type @border-color; }  As you can see, I've inserted some additional bottom padding, increased the vertical  margin around the title, and beefed up the bottom border to give it a unique look. The  fatter border also fits in better with the overall look and feel of the restaurant site.  Setting up the layout Before we jump into the menu items, let's quickly talk about the page layout. Make  sure you wrap the page in the page-body class that you created for the About page.  Each section of the menu has a col-lg-12 for the section title, and after that is a  three-column layout that uses the col-lg-4 grid classes. In this case, I'm choosing a  symmetrical layout as it makes sense for a menu. Here's some sample layout code:             Appetizers                   Item Name       Item description goes here.       $5   [ 60 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                Item Name       Item description goes here.       $5               Item Name       Item description goes here.       $5         The grid here should be pretty straightforward. Let's talk a bit more about the menu  items. I'm using an   tag for the title of each menu item. This allows them to  stand out and will help optimize our food titles for searching. You'll notice a new  class named .price that is attached to a   tag and wrapped around a dollar price.  I've created it because I want the price to stand out but don't want to use a header tag  here. This is purely for readability of the menu and has nothing to do with searching,  so a class is a better call:  .price {   color: @red1;   font-weight: 700; }  As you can see, I'm using the @red1 color variable again and I've upped font- weight to bold, or 700. This will allow the price to stand out easily when read.  [ 61 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the featured modal Near a few of the menu items, you'll notice a View link. This link will launch a  modal to show an image of the food item. You could also add more information  about the food item here if you like. For the purposes of this demo, I've added this  modal to only a couple of the items, but you might want to add it for all food items  on your restaurant website. Here's what our modal will look like once launched:  Now let's take a look at the code that is required to launch our food modal:       Green Salad     A great healthy start to your meal. <a href="" data-      toggle="modal" data-target="salad-modal">View      $9     The code here is exactly the same, with only an addition of the View link that will  trigger the modal:  <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="salad-  modal">View   [ 62 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now that we've set up the trigger, let's create the actual modal code. Here it is   for review:                                <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"             aria-label="Close"><span aria-              hidden="true">&times;            Appetizer                                       <img src="img salad.jpg" width="400" height="267"               alt="Salad">             Green Salad             A great healthy start to your meal.             $9                                    You'll notice that this modal code is a bit simpler than the reservations one. That's for  a couple of reasons. Firstly, we could be reusing this code on a number of items, so  we should try and keep it simple if we can. Secondly, I don't want this to look like a  generic Bootstrap modal. I want it to look like a nicer popup geared for a restaurant.  So, by removing some of the default parts that aren't needed, we can provide a more  customized look and feel. Let's go over what has changed:             <img src="img salad.jpg" width="400" height="267"         alt="Salad">       Green Salad       A great healthy start to your meal.       $9          [ 63 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   First, you'll notice that I've inserted an image. The width is set to 400 pixels, which  is a bit smaller than the overall width of our modal. Make sure you keep your image  size within that limit. If you'd like to use a larger image, increase the size of your  modal. You may even want to experiment with making your modal full screen.  The other big difference with this modal is that I have deleted the .modal-footer  section. Remember that with Bootstrap, some of these parts are optional. Just because  they are in the core code doesn't mean you can't experiment with them. In the case  of the footer, the default content is a submit or cancel button. This doesn't make a  ton of sense in the context of how we are using the modal, so just delete that part.  We still have the Close button in the header of the modal, or the user can click  outside the modal window to close it. Again, this is another example of customizing  a Bootstrap component to make it your own. I encourage you to push the design of  your modals even further.  You'll notice that on the menu, I've added a second modal under the Sandwich  heading. Here's the code for that modal:                                <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"             aria-label="Close"><span aria-              hidden="true">&times;            Sandwiches                                       <img src="img sandwich.jpg" width="400" height="274"               alt="Sandwich">             Veggie Sandwich             tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, salsa.             $12                                    [ 64 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Multiple modals In your own restaurant website, if you do go by the route of the popup for every menu  item, you may want to consider a cleaner approach for all your modal code. Currently,  you need to create a new instance of the modal HTML for each food item. This could  become quite long if you have a big menu. A better technique would be to create a  template for the modal into which you can load your values. One way you can do this  is with a JavaScript MVC library, such as Backbone or Angular. They will allow you  to create a view for that page, with a template  such as a Handlebar template  that you  can then load in the different values. This book isn't about JavaScript MVCs, so I won't  go further into that subject, but this is just something to keep in mind as you build  your production-ready restaurant website. The way that I've shown you will work   for a large menu, but using an MVC may be a cleaner solution. This concludes the Menu section. Before we move on to our last page, the Contact  page, here's all the code for the menu:                                         Appetizers                                       Garlic Bread           Delicious pan fried bread with olive oil.           $7                           Chicken Wings           One dozen wings, come in hot or bbq flavour.           $12                           Nachos           Great for sharing with friends.

The last thing do is set   up our Contact page, which will include an actual Google map along with some  required content that all restaurants should ideally list on their website. Here's   what the Contact page will look like once we're done:  [ 68 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   [ 69 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Inserting the Google Map If you haven't done this before, you should note that Google actually makes it quite  easy to generate maps that you can insert into your website. First, let's head over to  http:  google.com maps. Once it loads up, enter the address of your restaurant. I  don't have an actual restaurant, so I'm just using Vancouver as my search term. After  the map is generated, there will be a little Settings gear icon near the bottom-right  corner of the window. Click on this icon and you'll see a pop-up menu. Choose the  Share or Embed Map option from the menu. Clicking on this link will launch a modal. Make sure you click on the second tab,  called Embed Map. The first thing in the modal is the size of the map that you want  to embed; this will default to Medium. Click on this dropdown and choose Custom  size. For the width, make sure you enter 1170. You can make the height whatever  you want, but I've decided to make my map 500 pixels high.  After you've entered the size values, copy the iframe code given in the next section  and go back to the contact.ejs file.  Inserting the Google Map code Under the   with the .public-banner class that you set up on the home page,  you'll want to insert your Google Map code like this:                    <iframe   src="https:  www.google.com maps embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d20822.3905 3484898!2d-123.11777955000004!3d49.28020924999999!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m 2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x5486717f41ba2fb1%3A0xc6952794560a4 4aa!2sDowntown%2C+Vancouver%2C+BC!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1434608605144"  width="1170" height="500" frameborder="0" style="border:0">               Save the file and your map code is complete. You may want to recompile it at this  point and test it out before moving on to the rest of the Contact page. Note that in the  iframe code, you can see the width and height values. Feel free to tweak them in the  file if you want to perhaps change the height. You don't need to go back to Google  Maps to do that.  [ 70 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up the body of the page After we finish setting up the map in the header of the page, we need to set up   some content in the body. As in our other pages, we use the .page-body class to  wrap the entire section. For the remainder of the page, we're going to use the same  three-column layout that we had in our menu page.  I'm also going to reuse the .text-center utility class here to center all of the content  in the child   of this section. Let's take a look at all of the code and then we'll  review it:                         Hours           Open 7 days a week 12pm to 9pm.

As you can see, I've wrapped the entire section in the page-body class. I've also  added the .center class to the .row   so that everything is centered:     The first column should display the hours for the restaurant. As with the   menu page, I'm using an   tag here for the heading. It's good to try   and keep your headings consistent from a design standpoint.     For the center column, you should insert the address of your restaurant.    The last column has some additional information about how a person can  book a reservation. Not everyone may want to book online, so it's a good  idea to also provide a phone number for the Internet illiterate.  [ 71 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The reservation modal Like all your other pages, don't forget to add the partial to load in the reservation  modal at the bottom of the page:     That brings the final page of our restaurant website to a close.   Let's review all of the code for the Contact page before we move   onto the chapter summary.                                 <iframe src="https:  www.google.com maps embed?pb=!1m18!1m12! 1m3!1d20822.39053484898!2d-123.11777955000004!3d49.28020924999999!2m 3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x5486717f41ba2fb1%3 A0xc6952794560a44aa!2sDowntown%2C+Vancouver%2C+BC!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca! 4v1434608605144"   width="1170" height="500" frameborder="0"   style="border:0">                                                   Hours           Open 7 days a week 12pm to 9pm.

Summary That brings the second chapter to a close. We built on what you learned in Chapter  1, Advanced Bootstrap Development Tools, and used it to create a restaurant website.  Let's review what we learned. We learned how to build out actual pages with our  Harp development environment; import and use the Font Awesome web icon  library; import and use open source Google Web Fonts; use and customize Bootstrap  components such as the modal, page header, and carousel; create a Harp partial that  is used within a page template; use design principles when laying out grids and type  to create a unique look with Bootstrap; and create and insert a custom Google map  into our website.  [ 73 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Mobile First Bootstrap  Being the seasoned developer you are, you probably know that Bootstrap is actually  a mobile first CSS framework. Up until now, we haven't focused that much on the  mobile first philosophy. However, that will change in this chapter, as I teach you  how to build a mobile first aggregator website template. Along with taking the  mobile first approach for the first time, I'll cover using some custom JavaScript   to improve the UI and use a flat Google material inspired design.   [ 75 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   First of all, let's take a look at what the mobile website will look like when completed:  [ 76 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's also take a look at what the desktop version of this project will look like:  [ 77 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As you can see in the preceding screenshot, the layout is going to change depending  on our viewport size. I've optimized the mobile layout to make sure it's easy to use  on a phone or tablet. This is done through the use of buttons and text links that are  easy to touch. We also aren't relying on any hover states for our links or buttons since  you cannot hover on mobile devices. Finally, I've kept the layout pretty minimal to  allow for easy reading no matter which device is being used.  Setting up the template Before we get too far, let's create a new project called Chapter 3 by copying over  our boilerplate code we created in the first chapter. Let's update some of the basic  template files for this new project.  Adding a new web font I mentioned that we are going to use some Google material design principals and  styles in this project. The first thing I'd like you to do is to use the material design  font called Roboto. It's available for free from the Google web fonts website or you  can simply include the following line of code in the _layout.ejs file:  <link href='http:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Robo to:400,300,700,900' rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>  You'll notice I'm using the light, regular, bold, and super bold weights of the   web font.  Adding the JavaScript to _layout.ejs For this project, I've written a little custom jQuery that we'll use in our search bar.   I'll cover that a little later but for now, just insert the following code at the bottom   of _layout.ejs after jQuery:        $ document .ready function   {       $ "header-search" .hide  ;       $ "search-trigger" .on "click", function   {         $ "header-search" .toggle  ;       } ;     } ;      [ 78 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After pasting that snippet in, the _layout.ejs file is ready to go. Here's what the full  file should now look like:                  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-      scale=1">             <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"       href="css bootstrap.min.css">   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="css font-      awesome.min.css">       <link       href='http:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Robo to:400,300,700,900' rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>    <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements       and media queries -->   <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via       file:   -->         <script src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com html5shiv 3.7.2 html5shiv.min. js">      <script src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com respond 1.4.2 respond.min. js">                                    <script src="  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.11.1 jquery. min.js">    <script src="js bootstrap.min.js"       type="text javascript">   [ 79 ]  www.it-ebooks.info               $ document .ready function   {       $ "header-search" .hide  ;       $ "search-trigger" .on "click", function   {         $ "header-search" .toggle  ;       } ;     } ;          Updating the Less variables The next template file we need to make some changes to is our Less variables file.   If you've forgotten, you can find that file at:   css components _variables.less  Open the file and paste in the following color variables. We're not going to replace  our existing colors, we're going to simply add more for this project. It's not a good  idea to replace the base colors as that won't make your theme interchangeable:  @md-black: 212121; @md-dark-blue: 303f9f; @md-blue: 3f51b5; @md-light-blue: c5cae9; @md-pink: ff4081; @md-grey: 727272; @md-light-grey: b6b6b6;  I've name spaced each of the colors with md- so it's easy to tell the difference between  our base color palette and our new material design colors. By the way, if you're  looking for a great tool to generate material design color palettes, check out   http:  www.materialpalette.com .  Updating the text colors Next, let's update our text color variables to use the new material design colors:  @primary-text: @md-black; @light-text: @md-grey; @loud-text: @md-black; @inverse-text: @white; @heading-text: @md-dark-blue;  [ 80 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I'll also update the link colors to use or you can use new colors:  @primary-link-color: @md-blue; @primary-link-color-hover: @md-grey;  The last colors we need to update are the border colors:  @border-focus: @md-blue; @secondary-border-color: @md-blue;  That's it for color updates. The last thing we need to change in this file is our typeface  properties. Let's update our text variables to use Roboto:  @body-copy: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; @heading-copy: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; @heading-copy-bold: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;  That's it, that's all. Let's take a look at the entire _variables.less file to make sure  we haven't missed anything:     color palette  @black: 000; @dark-grey: 333; @grey: ccc; @light-grey: ebebeb; @off-white: f5f5f5; @white: ffffff;  @blue1: 3498db; @blue2: 2980b9; @red1: e74c3c; @red2: c0392b; @yellow1: f1c40f; @yellow2: f39c12; @green1: 2ecc71; @green2: 27ae60; @orange1: e67e22; @orange2: d35400; @aqua1: 1abc9c; @aqua2: 16a085; @purple1: 9b59b6; @purple2: 8e44ad; @navy1: 34495e; @navy2: 2c3e50;  [ 81 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      material design colors materialpalette.com @md-black: 212121; @md-dark-blue: 303f9f; @md-blue: 3f51b5; @md-light-blue: c5cae9; @md-pink: ff4081; @md-grey: 727272; @md-light-grey: b6b6b6;     background colors @primary-background: @white; @secondary-background: @off-white; @third-background: @md-light-grey; @fourth-background: @md-grey; @inverse-background: @md-dark-blue;     text colors @primary-text: @md-black; @light-text: @md-grey; @loud-text: @md-black; @inverse-text: @white; @heading-text: @md-dark-blue;     link colors  @primary-link-color: @md-blue; @primary-link-color-hover: @md-grey;     primary border properties  @border-color: @md-light-grey; @border-size: 1px; @border-type: solid; @border-focus: @md-blue; @secondary-border-color: @md-blue;     typography @body-copy: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; @heading-copy: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; @heading-copy-bold: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; @base-font-size: 14px; @font-size: 1em; @base-line-height: 1.5;      layout  @margin: 1em;  [ 82 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   @padding: 1em;     MIXINS     round corners or Border radius .round-corners  @radius: 2px  {   -moz-border-radius: @radius;   -ms-border-radius: @radius;   border-radius: @radius; }     animation transitions .transition  @transition: background .1s linear  {   -moz-transition: @transition;   -webkit-transition: @transition;   transition: background @transition; }  Our project's look and feel is now updated. By the way, isn't it great that we can  create a new visual design so easily? That's why it's really important to have a base  theme, as in Chapter 1, Advanced Bootstrap Development Tools, which you can use as a  boilerplate for all your projects. Why reinvent the wheel each time? We'll be adding a  bunch of additional CSS as we work through this chapter. For now, let's finish up the  header and the footer. We'll jump back to the CSS as it comes up.  Setting up the header For the projects header, we are going to use the default Bootstrap navbar and style it  to match our look and feel. We are also going to expand are header to use a couple of  custom sections. The first will be a collapsible search bar section and the second will  be some feed filters. We'll start off by wrapping the entire header in a   with the  class of .header:     We are wrapping the entire header so we can apply some bottom-margin to the  entire section:  .header {   margin-bottom:  @margin * 2 ; }  [ 83 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We'll also wrap the default Bootstrap navbar in another   with a class of  .header-nav:     This additional   will allow us to set the background color for the entire width  of the section. Otherwise, there would be a few pixels on either side that aren't  covered by styling the .navbar class:  .header-nav {   background: @md-blue; }  The next section I'll setup is the collapsible search bar. I'm going to wrap this section  in a   tag with an ID of header-search. In this case, I'm going to use an ID  because I want to target this section with jQuery a little later:     I'll go into full detail on the search bar a little later. For now, just set up the section.  The last section of our header that we need to set up is the filters. For this part, insert  a third   tag with the class name .header-filters:     Close that section off and the skeleton for our header is complete. You should enter  all this code into our _header.ejs partial if you're wondering. Let's jump back to   the Bootstrap navbar section and go over the HTML and CSS.  Navbar The actual markup for this is pretty straightforward. If you've coded a Bootstrap  header before, then this will look very familiar. Here's the entire section of code:                    <!-- Brand and toggle get grouped for better mobile             display -->                     <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed"               data-toggle="collapse" data-target="bs-example-                navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false">              Toggle navigation                                                            [ 84 ]  www.it-ebooks.info              Agger                     <!-- Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for             toggling -->         <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="bs-example-            navbar-collapse-1">                          <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="about-modal">About                <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="contact-modal">Contact                <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="login-modal">Login   Register                 <i class="fa fa-                search">                                         As I mentioned, this should be pretty straightforward. However, let's go over the  parts that aren't right out of the Bootstrap box. I've added a name for our .navbar- brand, which is Agger. This is the name of the fictional aggregator product.  Modal triggers In the navigation list of links, you'll notice I'm using modals for About, Contact,  and Login Register. I'm doing this because we are going to make this a one page  app. The homepage or feed will be the primary view where the user can see their  aggregated feeds. When they click on, say, About in the nav tag, a full page modal  will appear over the top of the main page and contain the content for the About  page. This way we can keep everything on one page instead of having to navigate  away. For now, simply add in the link code and we'll go over the modals more in  detail later:                 <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="about-modal">About                <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="contact-modal">Contact                <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="login-modal">Login   Register                 <i class="fa fa-                search">                 [ 85 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   That concludes the setup of the primary navigation HTML for the project. To get the  look and feel we want, we're going to need to do some customization to the navbar  styles in our theme. Let's go over each part as follows:  .navbar {   margin-bottom: 0; }  First of all, I've removed the bottom margin from the navbar. This is done   because once we reveal the hidden search field, we don't want a space between   the two sections:  .navbar-default, .navbar-default .navbar-collapse,  .navbar-default .navbar-form {   background: @md-blue;   text-transform: uppercase; }  .navbar-default .navbar-brand {   color: @inverse-text;   font-weight: 700; }  Next, I've changed the default navbar tag to use our material design blue. I've also  converted the links to uppercase to match the material design style:  For the navbar brand, I want it to stick out a bit from the actual navigation links.   To do that, I've set the color to c, which is set to @white. I've also bumped up the  font-weight tag to bold or 700 to give it some extra emphasis:  .navbar-default .navbar-brand:focus, .navbar-default .navbar-brand:hover {   color: @md-light-blue; }  .navbar-default {   border-color: @md-blue; }  I've also changed the focus and hover states for the navbar brand to use a material  design color:  [ 86 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We need to set the border-color for the default navbar to the same color as the  background. I don't want a different border color here, so just set it to this to   match the flat design style:  .navbar-default .navbar-nav > li > a {   color: @md-light-blue;   text-transform: uppercase; }  For our navigation links, I've set them to the material design light blue color. This is  slightly subdued compared to our brand color, creating some typographic hierarchy.  I've also converted the text to uppercase to match the material design style:  .navbar-default .navbar-nav > li > a:focus,  .navbar-default .navbar-nav > li > a:hover {   color: @inverse-text; }  For the hover state of the navbar links, I've gone with something a little more bold,  which is the @inverse-text color again. Remember that is set to @white:  .navbar-default .navbar-toggle, .navbar-default .navbar-toggle .icon-bar {   border-color: @md-blue; }  The preceding styles are the first ones that are mobile specific to our navbar tag.  If the viewport is small enough, the nav will be rolled into a menu automatically  that has a toggle button to open or close it. To make our design look a little less  Bootstrap-y, I've actually set the border color of the toggle to the same color as the  background. That way, you won't see the border and it will help to give you a more  unique look. This is also more inline with the material design style:  .navbar-default .navbar-toggle .icon-bar {   background-color: @md-light-blue; }  The bars within the mobile toggle switch are actually drawn with code. Therefore,  I'm changing their default color to use our color palette:  .navbar-default .navbar-toggle:focus,  .navbar-default .navbar-toggle:hover {   background-color: @md-dark-blue; }  [ 87 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The last part of this mobile toggle button is the hover state. I've set the background   to our dark blue but I've left the lines the same. This way only the background of   the button changes, which creates a nice subtle effect:  .navbar-default .navbar-collapse,  .navbar-default .navbar-form {   border-color: @md-dark-blue; }  These last styles control the bottom border of the mobile navbar once it's opened.  I've set this to dark blue to add a simple visual treatment to divide the header from  the list of links. That's it for our header styles, let's move onto the next section of the  header, which is the search bar.  Search bar One thing I didn't cover previously is the Search icon in the primary navigation.  I'm using the Font Awesome, which we covered in the previous chapter, to insert a  magnifying glass icon. This icon is wrapped in a link with the search-trigger ID.  As it's named, clicking on this link will be the trigger that reveals the search field:       <  li>  Go back to the   tag we setup earlier with the header-search ID, and insert  the following section of code:                                              <input type="text" class="form-control"                placeholder="Search for...">                             <button class="btn btn-default"                   type="button">Go!                                                     [ 88 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before I jump into this code, let's actually review the styles for the header-search  ID:  header-search {   height: 60px;   background: @secondary-background;   padding: 0  @padding * 1.5 ; }  I want the height of the search section to match the navbar tag so I've manually set  it to 60px. I'd like the background color to be different, though, so I'm using the @ secondary-background color variable. Finally, I've added some additional padding  to the section.  Back to the code within our main section. First of all, I'm wrapping the whole thing  in a container class so we can componentize this section. Next, I'll insert a full  width column using the largest view port. In this case, we only need that one class  because we want this column to stretch the width of our layout. Before I jump further into the Search bar, I should mention that I've added 100px   of horizontal padding to the container class to add some breathing space in   the layout:  .container {   padding: 0 100px; }  Within the column, you'll see I'm using a Bootstrap .input-group component. This  component combines a form input with a button. They butt up right next to each  other and give the feeling that they are actually one component. There is only one  custom style that is needed on this input-group:  header-search .input-group {   margin-top: 13px; }  I want the search field to be centered vertically in the section, so I've had to add 13px  of top margin to achieve this layout. That's it for the search section styles. Let's go  over the jQuery that will trigger the toggle.  [ 89 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Search bar jQuery Open up _layout.ejs and head to the bottom of the file. There you'll find the script  we inserted when we setup this file a little while ago:        $ document .ready function   {       $ "header-search" .hide  ;       $ "search-trigger" .on "click", function   {         $ "header-search" .toggle  ;       } ;     } ;      I'll assume that you have a basic understanding of jQuery and not cover document. ready. Here's a breakdown of what this script is doing:     Once the DOM is ready on page load, header-search   is being hidden.     If the search-trigger link in the navigation is clicked, the click function  is called and the header-search section is shown using the .toggle    method.     This method will also hide the section if the trigger button is clicked    on again.  I'm not a jQuery master so you should be able to follow along pretty easily here. Save  your file, fire up the Harp server and give this a try. Make sure you get this working  before you go any further because you don't want to be troubleshooting JavaScript  issues once the project is done. It's much easier to do it now before we add a bunch  of additional code. That completes the search bar section of the header. Click on the Search icon in  the main nav bar a few times to ensure you are happy with the effect. You could  consider adding a .fadeIn   jQuery method if you want to polish the transition  further. If not, then move onto the final section of the header, which is our filters.  Filters The filters section of the header is also pretty simple to setup. Let's start by looking at  the CSS for wrapping the .header-filters class:  .header-filters {   background: @primary-background;   height: 60px;   line-height: 60px; }  [ 90 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I'm using a third color here for this section. If the search bar is visible, we want a  different color for each section so you can see where the division is. I've also set the  height of this section to 60px to match the previous two. Finally, the line-height  property is also set to 60px as this will center anything in this area vertically. Let's  take a look at the HTML for this section:                                                Top                 Posts                 Recent                 Posts                                        You'll notice the structure of this section is very similar to the previous one. The  exception here is that I'm using an unordered list to display the content instead of   the input group. It's worth mentioning that you should strive to be as consistent   as possible when planning the structure of sections like this. It makes your code  much more modular and easier to scale and understand for other developers.  At this point, I'm using the default Bootstrap inline list component. Within each  list item, we have a small button that will be used as a filter. You'll notice that the  buttons are pink so I have definitely customized the primary button class. Let's   take a look at the CSS:  .btn-primary {   background: @md-pink;   border-color: @md-pink;   text-transform: uppercase; }  .btn-primary:hover {   background:  @md-pink - 111 ;   border-color:  @md-pink - 111 ; }  The background color and border color have both been set to the Material Design  pink from our palette. I've also converted the text to uppercase:  [ 91 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Our button hover state is using a Less operator to change our background and  border colors. You could insert a different color value here if you like. However,  with buttons, you generally want a subtle change on hover. Using an operator like  this will adjust the hex color slightly and give you a different shade of your primary  color, which is a nice trick to have in your bag.  With this, we have completed the markup and styles for our header. Let's take a look  at the complete HTML for the header partial before we move onto the footer:                                  <!-- Brand and toggle get grouped for better mobile             display -->                     <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed"               data-toggle="collapse" data-target="bs-example-                navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false">              Toggle navigation                                                                      Agger                     <!-- Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for             toggling -->         <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="bs-example-            navbar-collapse-1">                          <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="about-modal">About                <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="contact-modal">Contact                <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="login-modal">Login   Register                 <i class="fa fa-                search">                                         [ 92 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                                               <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Search for...">                             <button class="btn btn-default"                   type="button">Go!                                                                                                                  Top                 Posts                 Recent                 Posts                                              Remember to make sure you are breaking the Less code for each  component into its own .less file. Those component files should be  living in a subdirectory of  css called  components. You should then  be importing the component files into your master theme file.  [ 93 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up the footer For the project footer, we're going to keep things pretty simple. I'll be inserting some  social media icon links using the Font Awesome and a simple copyright statement.  Open up the _footer.ejs partial and paste in the following HTML:                                            <i class="fa fa-facebook-              official">                <i class="fa fa-twitter-              square">                <i class="fa fa-pinterest-              square">                <i class="fa fa-linkedin-              square">                       &copy; 2015 Agger                       The layout here is pretty basic. We only need to set the large viewport grid class as  this section will always span the width of the layout. I'm using the Bootstrap inline  list component to display the social media icons. You'll notice I'm using the Font  Awesome icon classes for the social media links. Finally, I've wrapped the entire  section in the   tag and am using it to apply some global footer styles:  footer {   margin-top:  @margin * 6 ;   padding-bottom:  @padding * 6 ;   padding-top:  @padding * 2 ;   background: @md-grey;   color: @md-light-grey;   text-align: center; }  Here's a breakdown of the styles for the header section of the project:          I've added a healthy top margin of 6 ems to allow for some breathing room  from the body of the page. I've also added a good amount of bottom padding so the text is not butted   up right against the bottom of the browser window.  [ 94 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           I've also added a little bit of top padding so that our icons will have some  space above them. I've set the background color to use the material design dark grey from our  palette.     To create a nice subtle effect, I've set the text color to the light grey from our   palette. This will also be the color for our social media icons.    Finally, I've set the alignment to center for the entire section.  The other styles we need to apply to the footer are for the links:  footer a {   font-size:  @font-size * 2 ;   color: @md-light-grey; }   footer a:hover {   color: @inverse-text; }  I've bumped up the font size of the links to double the normal size so that the social  media icons are more noticeable. I also set the link color to the same as the text color.  Finally, the hover color is set to @inverse-text or @white. That concludes the footer  section and our template is now ready to go. Next, we'll focus on the body of our  page and the modals that will be used for the About, Contact, and Login sections.  Single page apps A popular trend in web development today is the single page app. From a static  website design standpoint, that might sound a little scary. How do I approach an  app that is only one page when I'm used to dealing in multiple pages? It's actually  not that tough if you are strategic in how you design your project. For this chapter, our project has the following pages or sections: Home, About,  Contact, and Login Registration. Normally, you would treat those as four different  pages. With my design, home is the only actual page. The other elements will be  built off the home page. A little later, we'll do some heavy customization to the  Bootstrap modal component for the other sections we need.  For now, don't worry about this. I'm bringing it up because this project will only  have one actual page template, which is index.ejs.  [ 95 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up the index page The layout for the body of the page is the first place where we will use some different  grid classes. When the project is viewed on the desktop, there will be a main feed on  the left and a sidebar on the right. If we switch to viewing this on a mobile device,  there will be only one column with the sidebar sliding in below the main feed.   Here's the grid code we'll use to set this up:    …     …    The first column uses the col-lg-8 class for the desktop, which will set the feed to  roughly three-fourth of the width of the layout. However, for mobile devices, I'm  using the col-xs-12 class because I want it to span the width of the layout. The  second column is the sidebar and for the desktop I'm offsetting it by one column  with the col-lg-offset-1 class, then I'm using the col-lg-3 class to fill in the rest  of the row. This will set the sidebar to be roughly the remaining one-fourth of the  layout. For mobile devices, I'm using the col-xs-12 class again. This will cause the  sidebar to slide in below the feed on mobile viewport.  Feed Let's now look at the HTML for the feed section of the page. Within the feed   section, I'm going to create a new reusable class called .post that we'll use   for each aggregator entry:                         Aggregate your feeds with Agger.

We'll start with  the wrapping feed class. The entire feed is contained in a   tag with a class of  .feed on it. We'll use this section to hold all of our aggregator entries. Here are the  styles for this wrapping section:  .feed {   background: @primary-background;   padding:  @padding * 2 ;   margin-bottom:  @margin * 2 ;   .round-corners; }  The background color of the entire page is light-grey. I want the feed section to   pop so I'm going to set it to white using the @primary-background color variable.  Since we're using a different background color here, let's add some padding to the  section to apply some whitespace. I'll also add a little bit of a bottom margin so if you  were to add another section, it will be spaced out properly. Finally, I've added the  border-radius mixin to give the whole white section round corners.  Adding the feed header Primarily, for visual design reasons, I've decided to add a subheader inside the feed  that you can use to enter a little marketing message. In this case, I've entered a basic  description of what the web app would do: "Aggregate your feeds with Agger". To  make this stick out, I've stuck it inside a Bootstrap well component:       Aggregate your feeds with Agger.     [ 98 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I've also added some custom well styles so that it matches our look and feel. Create a  new component Less file in css components called _well.less. Then, update your  master theme to import this new file. Within the less file, add the following styles:  .well {   border: 0;   box-shadow: none;   .round-corners; }  .feed .well {   background-color: @md-grey;   color: @white; }  First of all, I've removed the well border and box-shadow so that it matches the  material design style. I've also applied the border-radius mixin so that the value   of the round corners is consistent throughout the project.  The second section creates some styles specific to the well that appears inside the  feed section. The reason I've done so that incase you want to use a well outside of the  feed. You might not want to apply the same colors, so it's good to make these colors  specific to this section. I've set the background-color to the Material Design grey and  the text color to white.  Filling in the posts section The following section is the actual feed of social media posts. Within this section,  I've created a reusable class called .post for each entry. I've also wrapped the entire  section in a new row that has another column class on it:     You'll notice that I've only applied a desktop specific column class here and it's set to  span the width of the layout. Remember, this is a nested row within the three-fourth  layout, so in this case we always want it to span the width of the section. Therefore,   it doesn't matter if you're viewing this on a desktop or mobile, you want the feed   to fill in the entire parent column.  [ 99 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Within this new row and column, we have a collection of   with the new   .post class on them. Let's take a look at a single post and breakdown the markup  and styles:                    Link Title Here    url.com  goes here                    Posted 5 hours ago on  Facebook<  a>                  First off, I've wrapped the entire section in a   tag with the class of .post:  .post {   padding-bottom: @padding;   border-bottom: @border-size @light-grey @border-type;   margin-top:  @margin * 2 ; }  For each post, we want to space them out a bit so I've added some bottom padding.   I also want a bottom border to help divide each post so I've added that in. Finally,  I've added a top margin so the contained text doesn't bump up right against the  bottom border. One problem with this layout is that the first feed post doesn't need  the top margin. The well component has already provided the necessary spacing.   So, what we need to do is apply a pseudo selector to the first post and remove that  top margin:  .post:first-child {   margin-top: 0; }  We can do that easily enough by targeting the first post child with the first-child  pseudo selector. Then, we can remove the margin for that post only.  Now, let's cover the contents of each post section. We'll start off by wrapping  the post title in a   tag and making it a link to the actual post or story on the  appropriate social network. Nesting the   tag within the   tag, we can  take advantage of some default Bootstrap typography styles. Within the   tag,  I've inserted the URL to the page for the user's reference. Following the post title, I've  used a   tag with a nested   tag for the post meta.  [ 100 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I've used the   tag a few times in this section and I've also applied some  custom CSS for the tag:  .post small {   color: @md-light-grey; }  .post small a {   color: @md-light-grey;   text-decoration: underline; }  .post small a:hover {   color: @md-grey; }  Let's take a closer look at what's happening with the CSS in this section.          I've changed the text color of the   tag to use the light grey from our  Material Design palette. I've also changed the link color within a   tag to use the same   light grey.     The link underline has also been removed from any hrefs inside a      tag.     The hover color for links nested in a   tag has also been updated    to use a Material Design color.     Also note that I'm only targeting   tags nested inside .post.   Therefore, if you use the tag outside of a post, it will fall back to the default  Bootstrap styling.  That concludes the markup and styles for the posts in the feed. The last thing we  need to add to the feed is some pagination.  Adding pagination to the feed Once you've closed off the post's row, we need to add another row that will hold the  pagination for the feed. Pagination will consist of a post count and a next button to  load the next ten posts:                                             Page 1 of 21                             [ 101 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                            Next                                       For pagination, we're going to use some mobile column classes again. The reason  for this is that we want the post count and the next button to stay on their respective  sides of the layout. I don't want the button to slide in under the post count on mobile  devices. To do this, we simply have to split the columns into two equals halves:    …     …    The code here should be pretty straightforward based on the previous explanation of  the feed. One thing to keep in mind is that if your count gets really large, like several  thousand posts, you might need to rebalance this a bit to make the first column  wider to allow for the large numbers. Otherwise, the count might break onto two  lines. However, I think it would be pretty hard to get it that wide.  Adding the feed count and the next button For the feed count part of the pagination, I've wrapped the count in a   tag with  a class of .feed-pages. This will allow me to style this a bit. The styling for this  section is actually the same as the next button, which has a   tag with a class   of .feed-nav:  .feed-nav, .feed-pages {   margin-top:  @margin * 2 ; }  All I've done here is add the same top margin to the pagination that the post entries  had. This will keep the flow of the layout consistent. Within the .feed-pages  section, I'm using the   tag again to make this text subtle. In the .feed-nav  section, I've added a primary button and the wrapping class takes advantage of  the Bootstrap .pull-right utility class to align the button on the right side of the  column. That concludes the feed section of the layout. The last part of the homepage  we need to go over is the sidebar.  [ 102 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Sidebar The sidebar of the web app is designed to be a deeper filters section for controlling  what content shows up. This is all static so you need to use your imagination a bit.  The idea is that you would check or uncheck boxes and the feed would automatically  update to show the changes. Here's the full markup for the section:           Channels                                Facebook                                                 Twitter                                                 Pintrest                                                 Linkedin                                                 Google+                                  Filters                                Comments                                      [ 103 ]  www.it-ebooks.info               Recent Comments                                                 Top Posts                                                 Recent Posts                                   RSS Feed          This section is actually pretty easy to breakdown. I'm using all default Bootstrap  styling and components here. Each filter section has a title wrapped in a   tag.  Below that is a collection of checkbox form components that would be used to toggle  posts on and off. Finally, at the bottom, there is a simple text link to an RSS Feed of  the master feed. The RSS Feed link should be a standard feature with any aggregator  app incase the user wants to subscribe to your feed.  That concludes the sidebar design and the markup for the homepage view of the  project. The last sections we need to review are all the modals. To make this a one-page  app, we're going to include the markup for the modals at the bottom of index.ejs.  This contains all of our views to one file, which is really handy. If you wanted to get  a bit more fancy, you could break each modal into its own partial and simply import  them into the bottom of index.ejs. However, for this exercise, I'm going to keep it  simple and add the markup right into the file.  About modal The first modal we're going to tackle is the About section. What I'm doing here  is wrangling the modal component to make it fill the entire screen, giving it the  appearance of a page floating over the top of the homepage. The actual HTML  structure of the modal doesn't change very much, but we will be doing some  advanced styling. Here's the markup for the modal:                       [ 104 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"             aria-label="Close"><span aria-              hidden="true">&times;            About                                                                     Pellentesque habitant morbi...               Pellentesque habitant morbi...            Pellentesque habitant morbi...                                                  The first thing you should do is give the modal a unique ID on the first  . In  this case, I've given it an ID of about-modal. Each modal needs a unique ID so  that the browser knows which one to trigger on the button press. From there, the  modal markup is out-of-the-box Bootstrap with one exception. The only difference  is that we are going to remove the .modal-footer section. This section contains the  Close and Submit buttons, which don't really fit our design. We want to give the  appearance that this is a page floating over the homepage, not a modal. We keep   the closing X in the .modal-header tag, which is how we will dismiss the modal.  Now that we've laid out the markup for the modal, let's go over all the styles that  need customization. Create a new Less component file in css components called  _modal.less. Make sure you import this file into your master theme:  The first thing we're going to do is edit the .modal-dialog class. We'll remove the  margin and set the width to auto, which will make the modal span the width of the  browser:  .modal-dialog {   margin: 0;   width: auto; }  .modal-backdrop {   background: @md-pink;   opacity: 0.9!important; }  [ 105 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, we need to edit the .modal-backdrop class. This class controls the semi- transparent black background that shows in the default modal. I've made a couple  of changes here that are important. First, I've changed the background to @md-pink  to fit in with our color palette. Second, I've set the opacity function of the backdrop  to 0.9. By default, the opacity is much lower and that makes text on top of it harder  to read. We want to darken this for readability. You'll also notice, I'm using the  !important helper here. Normally, this should be avoided at all costs. The reason it's  acceptable here is because this property is applied in Bootstrap.min,js. I don't  really want to start editing the library JavaScript so we're going to overwrite this  property once the DOM loads using !important:  .modal-content {   background: none;   color: @inverse-text;   box-shadow: none;   border: 0;      -moz-border-radius: 0px;   border-radius: 0px; }  The next part we need to customize is the .modal-content class. We're going to  remove the background here so that the pink we set in the backdrop shows through.  This will make the overlay look more like a page and Less like a modal. Since the  background is pink, I've changed the text color to @inverse-text or white. I've also  removed the box-shadow, borders, and border-radius from the modal to make it  look like a page. These changes are more about resetting the default component to  wrestle it into something new. This is a great example of how you can make websites  unique using Bootstrap. I constantly hear the complaint that all Bootstrap sites look  the same. That couldn't be more false if you put a little effort and creativity in:  .modal-content p {   margin-bottom:  @margin * 1.5 ; }  The default modal isn't really designed to hold paragraphs of content. Therefore,  the spacing between   tags is really tight. This customization is adding in spacing  more consistent to what you'd see on a regular text page. It's all about making the  content more readable:  .modal-header {   border-bottom: 0; }  [ 106 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   For the .modal-header class, I've removed the bottom border to, once again, make  this look more like a page, not a modal:  The last part of the header we need to change is the .close class. This is the X button  in the top-right corner of the modal. I've changed the color to @inverse-text so that  it matches our body copy color. I've removed the text-shadow to make it fit into the  material design style. Finally, I bumped up the opacity of the button. We want it to  be really noticeable as this is the only way to close the modal:  .close {   color: @inverse-text;   text-shadow: none;   opacity: 1; }  .modal a {   color: @inverse-text;   text-decoration: underline; }  .modal a:hover {   color: @md-black; }  I've also updated the link styles for the modal to better match the overall new look  and feel. I've set the link color to @inverse-text and added the link underline back  in so they stand out from the regular text. I've also added a really contrasting hover  color so that it's really clear when you hover over a link.  That's the final CSS we need to customize for the first modal. There are a few   other form styles we'll need to update for the Contact and Login modals. I'll   cover those next.  The Contact modal The Contact modal is setup exactly like the About modal, with the exception that we  are going to include a form in this section. Insert the following modal code below the  About modal in index.ejs:                              <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"             aria-label="Close"><span aria-              hidden="true">&times;    [ 107 ]  www.it-ebooks.info            Contact                                                     Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et                 netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.                   Vestibulum tortor quam, feugiat vitae, ultricies                     eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu libero sit                       amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi                         vitae est. Mauris placerat eleifend leo.                                                 Name                                                                     Email                                                                     Message                  <textarea class="form-control"                     rows="10">                                <button type="submit" class="btn btn-                  default">Send                                                              The first thing you should do with this second modal is give it a unique ID. For the  example, I've called the modal contact-modal. For the body of this modal, I've  included a new row with a column class of col-lg-6. The reason I've done that  is because I don't want the form inputs to stretch the width of the layout. That would  look a bit weird so I'm going to limit their width.  [ 108 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   At the top of the body section, I've included a   tag where you can enter a message  or description for the Contact form. Below that, I've inserted a basic Bootstrap form.  There are a few styles for the form that we need to customize, which are outlined   as follows:  I've added a bottom margin to our form so that it doesn't bump up against the bottom  of the browser window. This will insert a little bit of whitespace for readability:  .modal form {   margin-bottom:  @margin * 2 ; }  .modal .form-control {   border: 0;   box-shadow: none;    .round-corners; }  For the form control or input, I've reset a few styles to make the form fit our look  and feel. First off, I've removed the border around the inputs. Since the background  is pink, we don't really need these borders to make the fields stand out. I've also  removed the box-shadow because that doesn't jive with our flat design style.   Finally, I've reset the border-radius of the inputs to match our other components   for consistency:  .modal .btn-default {   border: 0; }  Similar to the input borders, we don't really need the button border here since it's  sitting on a pink background. I'm also using the default button here, which is white,  instead of using the pink primary button. That button type wouldn't work very well  on a pink background. That concludes the customizations we need to make to the  form styles inside of a modal. Let's move onto the following modal, which is for   the Login and Registration section.  [ 109 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Login modal The last modal or section we need to cover is the Login and Registration modal. This  one is going to be very similar to the Contact modal because it's a form. Let's jump  in and look at the HTML markup:                              <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"             aria-label="Close"><span aria-              hidden="true">&times;            Login                                                     Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et                 netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.

Like with the Contact modal, I've made  the form span only half of the page with the col-lg-6 column class. I've inserted  a new form that uses the same inputs as the previous modal. We're not using any  new components here, so we don't actually need to add anymore CSS. That brings  our single page app layout to its completion.

Summary That brings the third chapter to a close. We've covered how to create mobile first  websites using Bootstrap. We covered how to design a mobile first website, how to  use Google material design colors and styles, how to make advanced customizations  to the Bootstrap modal component, how to use some jQuery to make a search bar  hide show effect, and how to create static single page apps using Bootstrap.  [ 117 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Bootstrap Wiki  In this chapter, we're going to use Bootstrap to create a project that you might   not usually think would be suited for the framework. I'm a firm believer that you   can use the power of Bootstrap to create any type of web application, so we're   going to build a wiki. I'll take you through the process of building pages such as   the wiki home page, content page, and search results page. We'll also touch on  creating some mobile-specific styles using media queries to optimize the layout   for phones and tablets.   [ 119 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before we jump into creating the home page, let's take a look at what we'll be  building:  [ 120 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Customizing the template As in our previous projects, let's update our Harp templates, theme, and Less files  before we start with the actual pages. Make a copy of your boilerplate from chapter  1 and rename it to chapter 4 or Bootstrap Wiki. Open up the _data.json file and  insert the following code into it:  {   "index": {     "pageTitle": "Bootstrap Wiki"   },   "article": {     "pageTitle": "Article"   },   "search-results": {     "pageTitle": "Search Results"   },   "profile": {     "pageTitle": "Profile"   } }     index.ejs    article.ejs    search-results.ejs    profile.ejs  For this project, we'll have four different page templates, so we need to create an  entry for each of them. Remember that the first portion is the actual .ejs filename  and the pageTitle variable is what we'll use to set the   of each page. Go  ahead and create these four .ejs files in the root of your project directory. You can  just leave them blank for now:  Updating _layout.ejs The next thing that we'll do is update _layout.ejs, adding in any new code that is  specific to our new wiki project. I'm going to use a different Google web font for this  project, called Source Sans Pro. Insert the following line of code after theme.css in  the   of the file:  <link href='http:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Source+Sans+P ro:300,400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>  This will import three type weights: light  300 , regular  400 , and bold  700 .  [ 121 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding a new partial We're going to add something else new to the layout for this project. Just as we did in  the previous project, I'm going to use the modal component for the main navigation  menu. The difference here is that this will be a multipage app, compared to the last  project, which was a single-page app.  We don't want to insert the same modal code at the bottom of each page template.  This is excess of work, and it exposes you to possible errors or inconsistencies. It's  a better, more modular practice to create a new partial and put the modal code into  it. We'll then include it in the layout so that it is available for all page templates in  the wiki. We'll go over the actual modal code a little later; for now, just enter the  following line of code below the footer partial:     You might as well create the new partial file at this point. Create a new file called  _nav-modal.ejs. You can leave it blank for now, and save it in the  partial  directory in the root of the project. This completes the updates that you need   to make to the layout file. Here's what the entire file looks like when completed:                  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-      scale=1">             <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"       href="css bootstrap.min.css">   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="css font-      awesome.min.css">       <link   href='http:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Source+Sans+P ro:300,400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>    <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements       and media queries -->   <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via       file:   -->      [ 122 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       <script   src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com html5shiv 3.7.2 html5shiv.min.js"><  script>     <script   src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com respond 1.4.2 respond.min.js">                                     <script src="  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.11.1 jquery. min.js">    <script src="js bootstrap.min.js"       type="text javascript">       Setting up the Less variables As in our previous projects, the next step is to update our Less variables for our new  project. Open _variables.less, which is located in  css components. Let's go  through each new part section by section.  Adding new colors I've added a few new colors that I want to use in the project. Each of these colors is  prepended with bw- so that we can easily identify that they are project-specific; bw-  stands for Bootstrap wiki, if it's not obvious. Here are the new colors:  @bw-dark-primary: 00796b; @bw-primary: 009688; @bw-light-primary: b2dfdb; @bw-black: 212121; @bw-grey: 727272; @bw-light-grey: b6b6b6;  [ 123 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You might notice a different naming convention here. I've changed it to use primary  instead of the actual color name for the main color. This is simply to show you that  there is more than one way to organize your colors and you don't have to do it the  same way each time. For this project, there is one primary color, so it makes sense   to use this type of naming convention.  Background colors As I mentioned earlier, the color palette for this project is pretty simple, so I've  eliminated some of the background color options because we won't need them:  @primary-background: @white; @secondary-background: @light-grey; @inverse-background: @bw-primary;  I'm using white and light grey from our base palette, and then the primary color is  used for the inverse background. The reason I didn't use the Bootstrap Wiki light  grey here is that it has a darker value than I want. It's perfectly fine to combine color  palettes in this way. That's why we have a base palette. The base colors should be  your regular go-to colors that you feel comfortable using.  Text colors The updates to the text colors are straight forward. I've simply changed the values   to use the new color palette:  @primary-text: @bw-black; @light-text: @bw-grey; @inverse-text: @white; @heading-text: @bw-primary;  Link and border colors The same goes for the link and border colors. We're just replacing the values with the  new color palette:  @primary-link-color: @bw-primary; @primary-link-color-hover: @bw-dark-primary;  @border-color: @light-grey; @border-size: 1px; @border-type: solid; @border-focus: @bw-primary;  [ 124 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Typography For the typography variables, you'll need to update the copy to use the new typeface,  which is called Source Sans Pro. I've also bumped up the base font-size to 16px. This  is done to increase the readability of the text; since this is a wiki, we want it to be  easy to read!  @body-copy: "Source Sans Pro", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; @heading-copy: "Source Sans Pro", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans- serif; @base-font-size: 16px;  Rounder corners The final update needed in this file is bumping up the border-radius value to 5px. I  thought I'd mix it up and make the round corners more obvious in this design:  .round-corners  @radius: 5px  {   -moz-border-radius: @radius;   -ms-border-radius: @radius;   border-radius: @radius; }  The updates here should be pretty simple for you. Let's check out what the entire file  looks like:     color palette @black: 000; @dark-grey: 333; @grey: ccc; @light-grey: ebebeb; @off-white: f5f5f5; @white: ffffff;  @blue1: 3498db; @blue2: 2980b9; @red1: e74c3c; @red2: c0392b; @yellow1: f1c40f; @yellow2: f39c12; @green1: 2ecc71; @green2: 27ae60; @orange1: e67e22; @orange2: d35400; @aqua1: 1abc9c;  [ 125 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   @aqua2: 16a085; @purple1: 9b59b6; @purple2: 8e44ad; @navy1: 34495e; @navy2: 2c3e50;     custom colors prepended with bw- @bw-dark-primary: 00796b; @bw-primary: 009688; @bw-light-primary: b2dfdb; @bw-black: 212121; @bw-grey: 727272;  @bw-light-grey: b6b6b6;     background colors @primary-background: @white; @secondary-background: @light-grey; @inverse-background: @bw-primary;     text colors @primary-text: @bw-black; @light-text: @bw-grey; @inverse-text: @white; @heading-text: @bw-primary;     link colors @primary-link-color: @bw-primary; @primary-link-color-hover: @bw-dark-primary;     primary border properties @border-color: @light-grey; @border-size: 1px; @border-type: solid; @border-focus: @bw-primary;     typography  @body-copy: "Source Sans Pro", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; @heading-copy: "Source Sans Pro", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans- serif; @base-font-size: 16px; @font-size: 1em; @base-line-height: 1.5;  [ 126 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      layout @margin: 1em; @padding: 1em;     MIXINS     round corners or Border radius .round-corners  @radius: 5px  {   -moz-border-radius: @radius;   -ms-border-radius: @radius;   border-radius: @radius; }     animation transitions .transition  @transition: background .1s linear  {   -moz-transition: @transition;   -webkit-transition: @transition;   transition: background @transition; }  Updating the header and footer Now that our Less variables are ready to go, let's move on to updating our template  partials. At this point, we'll set up a new header and footer. We'll also create a couple  of more placeholder files for sidebars, which will be added a little later. For now,  create the following blank files for later use:     _nav-modal.ejs  if you haven't already     _sidebar.ejs    _sidebar-search.ejs  As explained earlier, the nav modal will be our primary navigation component.  The sidebar partial will be used on almost every page, so I've broken it down into  a partial. Thus, it can be easily edited. Our search results page will have a different  sidebar, so a partial has been created for that as well.  Coding the header As we've done in a past project, we're not going to use the default Bootstrap header  here. We're going to use the basic grid, the inline list component, and some wrapper  classes to create a custom header. The header will be divided into two sections. The  first will be the logo and actual navigation links. The second will be the full-width  search bar.  [ 127 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   One thing to keep in mind is that this is a wiki. The links along the top are not the  primary navigation. They are simply a collection of useful links that help the user  find what they are looking for faster. I wanted to mention this so that you don't get  confused when we cover the nav modal. First things first, let's insert the wrapper  code for the entire header:  We're using the default Bootstrap container here, but I have added some custom  styles to it as I want to squish the width a little:  The .header class will be our wrapper for the entire header. It has the following  basic styles applied to it:            ..        .container {   padding: 0 100px; }  .header {   margin-top:  @margin * 2 ; }  .header a {   color: @bw-black;   font-weight: bold; }  .header a:hover {   color: @bw-grey;  }          Let's take a closer look at the CSS for our header and what's going on:  I've added a top margin to the header to move it off the top edge of the  browser. I don't want to use the default link colors here, so I've changed them. I've also  made the header links bold.  [ 128 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Coding the header nav Let's code the first portion of the header, which is the logo and header links. Insert  the following markup inside .header  :                                                <img src="img logo.png"  width="90" height="43" alt="Bootstrap Wiki Logo">                 Main Page                 Categories                 Favorites                <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="nav- modal">                                          The nav is wrapped in a class called .header-nav. Within this  , I'm using the  Bootstrap inline list component to create the layout of the logo and header links. For  this project, I thought I'd mix it up and use an image for the logo.  You'll notice that the text link   tags have a class of .desktop-only on them.  That is there because we are going to hide them in the mobile view. The reason  I'm doing this is to make the header work for phones. You'll also remember that  these text links are not our actual nav; they are just helpers. The final list item is a  hamburger menu icon that triggers the nav. This icon link will not be hidden in   the mobile view. Let's review the styles that construct this part of the page:  I've added a little margin at the bottom of the header nav; this is equal to the margin  I added at the top of the header wrapper:  .header-nav {   margin-bottom:  @margin * 2 ; }  .header ul {   margin-bottom: 0; }  .header ul.list-inline li {   margin-right:  @margin * 1.25 ; }  [ 129 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We need to tweak the list component a bit so that it works for our layout:          I've removed the bottom margin from   so that it doesn't give me extra  spacing. Remember that we set the spacing on .header-nav. I want more horizontal spacing than what comes out of the box with this  component, so I've bumped up the right margin.  Coding the header search bar Now that the logo and header links are complete, let's insert the full-width search  bar. After .header-nav  , insert the following code:                                                              <input type="text" class="form-control"                   placeholder="Search">                                 <button class="btn btn-primary"                     type="button">Go!                                                                     The section is wrapped in a   with the class of .header-search. Contained  within, we're using a well component that has an input-group nested inside.  But before we can totally finish this, we need to update a couple of Bootstrap  components, namely the button and well components.  Adding custom button styles Create a new file called _buttons.less and save it in the  css components  directory. Next, pop open theme.less and insert this line of code in the   Modules section:  @import "components _buttons.less";  [ 130 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Go back to the _buttons.less file and insert the following code:  .btn {   text-transform: uppercase; }  .btn-primary {   background: @bw-primary;   border-color: @bw-primary;   color: @white; }  .btn-primary:hover {   background: @bw-dark-primary;   border-color: @bw-dark-primary; }  Let's review the CSS code for our buttons:      I want to capitalize the labels of all my buttons, so I've transformed the text  to uppercase in the .btn class.     For the primary button, I'll use the primary color from the palette. The hover   state will use the dark version of the primary color.  Adding custom well styles Next, we need to add some custom well styles for the search bar section. Create a  new file called _well.less in  css components. Open up theme.less and insert  the following line of code after the button one you just added:  @import "components _well.less";  Head back to _well.less and insert this code:  .well {   border: 0;   box-shadow: none;   background-color: @secondary-background;   .round-corners; }  [ 131 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's review the CSS in more detail for the well component:            I've removed the border and box-shadow from the well I've set the background-color to use one of our colors I've inserted the round-corners or border-radius mixin so that the well uses  our 5px value  Finishing off the header search Now that we've updated those two components, let's finish off going through the  header search section. Here's the code again, for reference:                                                              <input type="text" class="form-control"                   placeholder="Search">                                 <button class="btn btn-primary"                     type="button">Go!                                                                     The entire section is wrapped in the .header-search class, which actually doesn't  have any styles applied to it—mostly just for organization at this point. Within the  section, insert a well component and then insert an input group. That will finish off  this section, and the header will be complete. Here's what the full header partial code  should look like:                                                   [ 132 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                 <img src="img logo.png"                 width="90" height="43" alt="Bootstrap Wiki                   Logo">                 Main                 Page                <a                 href="">Categories                <a                 href="">Favorites                <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-                target="nav-modal"><i class="fa fa-                  bars">                                                                                                              <input type="text" class="form-control"                   placeholder="Search">                                 <button class="btn btn-primary"                     type="button">Go!                                                                           [ 133 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the navigation modal Before we move on to coding the footer, I think this would be a good time to set up  the navigation modal. As in the previous chapter, we're going to use a Bootstrap  modal component and customize it to look like a full page overlay when you click on  the hamburger icon in the header links. Let's start by opening up _nav-modal.ejs,  which is in the  partial directory. Once you have it open, insert the following code:                              <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"             aria-label="Close"><span aria-              hidden="true">&times;                                                       + Add Content                 Profile                 About                 Contact                 Logout                                                 The code here is very similar to what we did in the last chapter, but with one  exception; I've removed the modal title section as I don't want to display a title when  this opens up. Aside from this, we have a collection of links within the body of the  modal, with some custom styles. Let's go over the styles next by popping up modal. less, which is located inside  css components:  .modal-dialog {   margin: 0;   width: auto; }  .modal-backdrop {   background: @white;  [ 134 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     opacity: 0.9!important; }  .modal-content {   background: none;   box-shadow: none;   border: 0;   text-align: center;      -moz-border-radius: 0px;   border-radius: 0px; }  .modal-header {   border-bottom: 0; }  .close {   color: @bw-black;   text-shadow: none;   opacity: 1; }  .modal a {   color: @bw-black;   text-decoration: none;   font-weight: 700;   font-size:  @font-size * 4 ; }  .modal a:hover {   color: @bw-primary; }  Let's go over all the CSS in depth for the modal component:     The .modal-dialog is unchanged from the previous chapter          The only other things that have changed are the color and font-size in the   In the .modal-backdrop class, I've changed the background color to @white In the .modal-content class, I've set text-align to center  .modal a declaration  [ 135 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This completes the updates that you need to perform for the navigation modal. It  would probably be a good idea to compile your code and test it out before moving  on. However, you may want to complete the footer first and then test out the entire  page template at once.  Adding the footer Like the header, the footer of this project is divided into two sections. The top section  has the language selector links. The second part has the footer links and copyright  statement. Open up _footer.ejs, which is located in the  partial directory, and  insert the following code:  The entire section is wrapped inside a class of .footer-language. Within this  section is another inline list component for displaying all the available languages.  Let's review the wrapper class styles first:                                            Language:               English               French               German               Italian               Spanish                                  .footer-languages {   background: @inverse-background;   color: @bw-black;   padding:  @padding * 2  0; }  .footer-languages ul {   margin-bottom: 0; }  [ 136 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   .footer-languages a {   color: @white; }  .footer-languages a:hover {   color: @bw-black; }  Let me summarize what is happening with the footer CSS:      I've set the background of this section to use the @inverse-background color  variable     The text color is set to our custom black so that it really pops out of the   background I've added some top and bottom padding to give the section some breathing  space         As with the header links, I've removed the bottom margin from   so that   the spacings above and below the list are equal     Finally, I've set the links in the section to white, and the hover color is black  The rest of this section depends on default Bootstrap styles, so this part is complete.  Let's add the second half of the footer, which is the utility links and the copyright  statement. Insert the following markup below the language section:                                            RSS               Terms &amp; Conditions               About               Contact              Copyright 2015 Bootstrap Wiki                                 This section is actually the true footer of the project. However, I wanted the  language picker to appear on every page, so I included it with the footer partial,  again saving me some effort if I want to customize it with more languages.  [ 137 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I've wrapped this entire section in a class of .footer. Within that, I'm using—you  guessed it—another inline list component to lay out the links. The list component is  actually a really powerful flexible piece of code that you can use for many things.  Before you start laying out a bunch of  , I encourage you to consider it for your  layout challenges. Let's review the .footer styles:  .footer {   color: @bw-light-grey;   margin:  @margin * 2  0; }  .footer a {   color: @bw-light-grey; }  .footer a:hover {   color: @bw-grey; }  The last thing we need to do is review the CSS for the links in the footer:          I've set the text color for the footer to use our palette's light grey. I've also  added some top and bottom margin for whitespace reasons. I set the footer links to the same light grey color to make them subtle. On  hovering, they will change to darker grey so that they are easy to read.  This completes the footer code. Let's see what the entire thing should look like:                                              Language:               English               French               German               Italian               Spanish                                [ 138 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                               RSS               Terms &amp; Conditions               About               Contact              Copyright 2015 Bootstrap Wiki                                 This completes the updates to the Harp template files for the new project. We'll come  back in a moment and fill in the new partials. Next, let's move on to setting up the  new home page.  Coding the homepage The first page that we will tackle in this project is the wiki home page. It consists of a  two-column layout. The left side will be a feed of updated pages, and the right side  will be our sidebar, which contains a list of categories. We'll also set up a page title  and button for adding new content or pages.  Setting up the page title section Let's go ahead and set up the page title section first. It consists of an   heading  and an Add Content button:                           Featured Pages                                                     + Add                 Content               [ 139 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                I've divided each side into equal-width columns with the .col-lg-6 class. You may  want to increase the size of the page title   if you anticipate having longer page  titles. You'll notice that with the Add Content button, I'm using another inline list  even though there is only one button. In other pages, there will be multiple buttons,  so I'm just being consistent here. Let's review the CSS for this section:  .page-title {   border-bottom:  @border-size * 5  @border-type @border-color;   padding-bottom: @padding; }  Let me explain how the .page-title CSS works:         The page title section has a bottom border of 5px so as to divide it from the   page content I've also added some padding at the bottom of the section so that the border  doesn't bump right up against the text: .add-content {   line-height: 36px; }  I've set the line-height for the add-content section to 36px, which matches the   font-size of our   tag. This will force the button to be vertically centered with   the page title. Setting the wrapping   line-height to match the height of the   text is a simple way to achieve the ever-tricky vertical centering. That finishes up   this section, but before we go any further, we should add a Less component for   our typography styles.  Setting up the type styles Create a new file called _typography.less and save it in the  css components  directory. Next, open up theme.less and enter the following line of code in the  Modules section:  @import "components _typography.less";  [ 140 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Save theme.less and head back to _typography.less. Enter this code in the file  and save it:  h1 {   margin: 0;   color: @bw-primary;   font-weight: 300; }  h5 {   color: @bw-grey;   text-transform: uppercase;   font-weight: 700; }  small {   color: @bw-light-grey; }  Let's review the values for the typography styles:     For the   tag, I've removed bottom-margin so that the true height of the   tag is 36px. In this way, it will line up perfectly with the Add Content button. I've set the color of   to our primary hue and font-weight will be the light  version of Source Sans Pro.         The   tag will be used in the sidebar, and I'm customizing it to use one of  the palette's grey values. I've also converted it to uppercase, and font-weight  will be bold.     Finally, we'll be using the   tag in the content feed, and we've set it to   use one of our colors.  Coding the page body Let's move on to coding the main body of our home page. It's divided into two  columns and the wrapping code looks like this:                          ..                        [ 141 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You'll notice that I've included a partial here for the sidebar. Let's go ahead and set  up the code for that now.  Coding the sidebar  Open up _sidebar.ejs, which is in the  parital directory. Once you have it open,  insert the following code:             Categories                Arts           Cars           Computers           Education           Family           Finance           Food           Health           Hobbies           Holidays           Home &amp; Garden           Pets           Philosophy           Relationships           Sports           Technology           Travel           Work                Make sure you include the grid   in the partial so that it's a fully contained  component. The sidebar makes use of the Bootstrap unstyled list component. We've  already set up the custom styles for the   header tag, but we do need to add some  sidebar styles to theme.less:  .sidebar {   background: @secondary-background;   padding: @padding;   margin-bottom:  @margin * 2 ; }  [ 142 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let me explain further how the sidebar CSS works:         I'm using the secondary background color here, which is a light grey. I've added some padding to the sidebar so that the text has some   breathing space.     Finally, I've added a little margin-bottom in case the sidebar becomes longer   than the feed. And we don't want it to bump up right against the footer.  That concludes the setup of the sidebar. Let's move on to setting up the feed portion  of the home page.  Coding the home page feed Head back to the first column that has the class of .col-lg-8 on it, and insert the  following feed code:                                 Page name                 goes here                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing                 elit.

Each page  or piece of content is wrapped in this .post class. Let's break down an individual  instance of this code:                     Page name                 goes here                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing                 elit.

Each post has a  heart that is inserted from the font awesome library:      [ 145 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you want to make the heart look selected, you need to add the .favorite class   to the   tag:      The styles for both states of the heart icon are as follows:  .post i {   color: @light-grey; }  i.favorite {   color: @red1; }  That's the full breakdown for each post or entry in our feed. The last thing that we  need to go over is the pagination for the feed. At the very bottom of the feed, after  the last post, you'll see this code:       Next       Page     I'm using a next page type pagination to show the next 10 entries in the feed. The  following styles are used for the layout:  .feed-pagination {   margin-top:  @margin * 2 ;   padding-bottom:  @padding * 2 ;   text-align: right; }  Let's breakdown what's happening with the pagination CSS:     As with the Post component, I'm applying some margin and padding for   vertical consistency I've set the alignment of this section to right as I want the button to float on  the right-hand side of the        This completes the layout of the homepage.

Here's what the page we're going to build will look like:  [ 149 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   First, create a new file called article.ejs and save it to the root of your project. If  you remember, earlier in this chapter, we added this page to the _data.json file. If  you name it differently, make sure that the filename matches what was entered in the  _data.json file. Once you have saved the file, you may want to compile the project  to ensure that everything is working correctly. It's a good idea to do a compile every  so often so that you catch errors before you are done. Waiting until the very end will  make it more complicated to troubleshoot compile errors if you have them.  Start off your new page template by coding a wrapping .container   for the  entire page:      ..    The first section that we will insert into the container is the page title. This is identical  to the page title from the index template, with the addition of one button. First of all,  you'd want to update the   tag with the title of your page:   Page Title   Next, we'll insert an Edit button that will allow the user to edit this wiki page. We're  going to insert this button next to the Add Content button. Now you see why I  decided to use an inline list here. I'm inserting an additional button as a new  :       Edit     I've used the .btn-default class here as I want the Add Content button to stand  out more than the Edit button. This is a simple design trick to set the hierarchy of   our two buttons.  This concludes the changes that we need to make to the page title section of   the template.  Coding the article page body Let's move on to coding the body of the article page. We're going to reuse the   .page-content and the .feed   structure that we set up on the index template  here. A new addition to the page is the .post-meta section, where will add some  metadata about this page. After opening .feed  , add the following block   of code:             23    Last edited:    [ 150 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         January 1, 2015 by  John Smith          The .post-meta class doesn't actually have any custom styles attached to it. It's  simply an identifier for the section. However, if you'd like to customize this part   of the page, you can easily use the presetup class to do so.  Within the .post-meta section, I've added a   tag; this tag actually holds the  content. Using the   tag here will give us a bottom margin to space out the text  from the body copy that we'll be adding next. The metadata should be secondary  to the actual body text, so I've wrapped it in a   tag. This will lighten the  text and make it a bit smaller. The favorite icon and link at the end will still use the  default styles and stand out a bit more, which is what I want. This concludes the   .post-meta section of the template.  Adding the body content The next part of the layout is the addition of body content for the page. Here, I'm  going to reuse the .post class that I created in the previous template. Within that   , simply enter the content for the page. This can include text tags, headers,  images, videos, or whatever you want. I've included some   tags in the example   shown later  to keep things simple. After you close the .post  , make sure   you keep the pagination section so that users can navigate from page to page on   your wiki:       Next       Page     That concludes the setup of the content section of the page. The last thing that   you need to add is the sidebar partial. This is exactly the same as the index template.  Insert the partial code in the same location. You can also see the entire page   template here:                               Page Title                                         [ 151 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                Edit<  button>                                      + Add  Content                                                                                                               23    Last  edited: January 1, 2015 by  John Smith                                                      Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus  et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.

Compile your project and fire  up the server. Then enter the following URL in a browser to test it out:  http:  localhost:9000 article.html  Once you're happy with how everything looks, move on to the next section, where  I'll show you how to create the search results template.  [ 153 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The search results page template It's time to create the third template for our wiki project. Create a new file and name  it search-results.ejs. As with the previous template, make sure you keep the  name the same or update the value in _data.json for this template. Before we   jump into coding the page, let's see what it will look like when we're done:  [ 154 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You'll notice that the search results page is similar to our other pages, but with one  major difference. It has a different sidebar. Previously, I had you creating a second  sidebar file and as part of this section. We will code it and insert it into the layout.  In the case of the search results page, it has some specific search-related content and  filters that we want to show in place of the regular categories. That's why I've created  a second sidebar for this template.  Updating the page title Before you jump into the body of the page, you'd want to change the   tag to  search results. In this case, we won't have an Edit button, so the only button to the  right will be the add content one. Aside from the change in the page title, everything  should be the same as that in the index template.  Updating the post-meta class Here, I'm again going to use the .post-meta section that I set up in the article  template. In this case, we'll insert some search-specific data into the section:             About 2,003 results found in 0.45 seconds         Adding search posts Each search entry in our feed will use the same .post   structure that we set up  on the home page, but with one exception. I've put an additional   tag after the  page title; it includes the URL of the page:           Page name goes       here       http:  bootstrapwiki.com path to page here      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

First of all,  update the partial to use the right file:     Next, open the _sidebar-search.ejs file in  partial and enter the following code:             Related Searches                 Keyword  something            Keyword  something           else            Keyword  maybe           this                    Related Tags                Tag 01           Tag 02           Tag 03           Tag 04           Tag 05                    Related Topics                Topic 01           Topic 02           Topic 03           Topic 04           Topic 05                [ 156 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The code here should be pretty straightforward. Each section of the sidebar has  a heading that uses an   tag. Under each heading, I'm using an unstyled list  component to list a search-related filter. Finally, each section is divided by an  . I  have customized the color of the   tag on the sidebar with the following styles:  .sidebar hr {   border-color: @bw-light-grey; }  Here's what the entire page template code looks like:                               Search Results                                                     + Add  Content                                                                                                               About 2,003 results found in 0.45 seconds                                                         Page name goes  here                 http:  bootstrapwiki.com path to page here<  small>               Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing  elit.

You'll notice that we didn't  really need to update much CSS for this template. The HTML was also quite  straightforward! That was by design and it's an example of making your project  modular. When you're coding a project, make sure you think about how to reuse your  CSS classes. We could have easily called .post, .feed, or .post-meta something  more page-specific, which would have resulted in more CSS than we need. Keep it  clean and it will be easier to manage down the road as the project grows.  [ 159 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Profile template The last template that we need to create for our wiki is the Profile page. This  template will reuse some of the classes that we have already set up and add a   bit more to create a complete user profile page. Take a look at this screenshot   to understand what we'll be building:  [ 160 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding an avatar We're going to update our page title section to include a user avatar for this page.  Update the   tag to include an image, as shown in this example:   <img src="http:  fillmurray.com 36 36" width="36" height="36"  alt="Avatar"> John Smith   Also make sure you change the page title to be your user's name. In this case, I'm  using John Smith. After you've finished this, add the Edit button back to the inline  list so that you can allow the user to edit their profile:       Edit     This concludes the page title setup. Let's move on to the body of the page. It is going  to use the same   structure as all our other templates. In this case, however, we  are going to use multiple .post   to separate a few different chunks of content.  The first piece of content that we'll insert is a bio for the user:                 Bio               Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus  et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.

It uses a new  .social-media class and it will contain links to the user's social media websites. I've  created a new section here because I'm going to bump up the size of the icons and I  want to isolate these styles:                 Social Media                                 <  i>                     <  a>                    <  a>                    <  a>                   <  i>                     <  a>                             There are a few custom styles associated with this section, as shown in the   following code:  .social-media {   margin-top:  @margin * 2 ;   padding-bottom:  @padding * 1.5 ; }  .social-media i {   font-size:  @font-size * 2 ; }  [ 162 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's review the CSS for the .social-media section:     The .social-media class has some simple margin and padding added to it   to match the post layout styles I've bumped up the size of the icons with the next declaration so they really  stand out on the page      The last thing we need to add to this page is the regular sidebar partial, as we did on  the index template.

You will need to insert these styles at the bottom of theme.less in the   css directory. Before I explain the code, here's a preview of what the mobile version  will look like on a phone:  [ 165 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, let's review the custom styles that go into the making of this layout:  @media  max-width: 768px  {   .container {     padding-right: @padding;     padding-left: @padding;   }    .add-content {     float: left;     margin-top: @margin;   }    li.desktop-only {     display: none;   }    .modal a {     font-size:  @font-size * 2 ;   } }  Let me explain how the mobile specific styles work for this project:      I'm using the value of 768px in the media query to target tablets and phones  with these mobile-specific styles.     The styles in the .container class reset the left and right padding. I've   added more padding to our desktop containers to squeeze the layout. I want the Add Content button to left align in mobiles, so adding the float  will accomplish this. The margin will ensure that the button doesn't bump  into the page title.         The .desktop-only class will hide some of the header links that aren't as   important. Those links are only for the desktop version of the user will have  to rely on the navigation modal to navigate on a phone. I've shrunk the text down for the links that appear in the modal to make it  more suitable for smaller view ports.      [ 166 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary That brings the fourth chapter to a close. We've successfully created our own wiki  layout using Bootstrap. Anything is possible with this framework if you use a little  creativity. Let's review what you learned: how to create a wiki layout with Bootstrap,  how to add multiple templates to a project in Harp, how to customize the navigation  modal that we made in the previous chapter, how to use Harp partials for more than  just the header and footer, and how to code our template in a modular fashion to  save time and produce Less code.  [ 167 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Bootstrap News Magazine  In this chapter, I'm going to show you how to create an art-and-design Bootstrap  magazine website. We'll be creating a home page and an article template that you  can use to create your own blog or magazine. As part of this chapter, I'm going to  show you how to use a flexbox layout within the Bootstrap grid. Like the previous  projects, I'll use a minimal design with lots of whitespace, and to make things  interesting, I'll you show you how to implement Disqus comments.   [ 169 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before we jump into updating our template, let's take a look at the home page:  [ 170 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Customizing the template As in our previous projects, we start by copying our Boilerplate project and   create a new one called Chapter 5. Open up the _data.json file and insert   the following code:  {   "index": {     "pageTitle": "Home"   },   "article": {     "pageTitle": "Article",     "layout": "_layout-article"   } }  For this project, we are going to create two page templates. Let's start by creating   two new files in the root of our project. For now, they can just be blank and we'll   start to fill them in a little later:     index.ejs    article.ejs  Updating _layout.ejs Let's start by updating the _layout.ejs file in the root of our new project. The  layout for the home page is pretty straightforward. Make sure you include the line  of code that will import Source Sans Pro as our web font. Yep, we're going to use it  again in this project:  <link   href='http:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:300,  400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>  This will import three type weights: Light  300 , Regular  400 , and Bold  700 . When  we get to the article template, we're actually going to create a unique layout for it.  However, we'll cover that a little later, after the home page. For now, simply create  another file in the root of the project, called _layout-article.ejs. This completes  the customizations of our base layout file. Here's what the entire file should look like:                 [ 171 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-    scale=1">             <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"     href="css bootstrap.min.css">   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="css font-    awesome.min.css">       <link     href='http:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:    300,400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>    <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements     and media queries -->   <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via     file:   -->         <script       src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com html5shiv 3.7.2 html5shiv.min.js">             <script       src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com respond 1.4.2 respond.min.js">                                      <script     src="  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.11.1     jquery.min.js">    <script src="js bootstrap.min.js"     type="text javascript">       [ 172 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up the Less variables The next step will be to set up the new Less variables for the magazine project. Open  the _variables.less file, which is found in css components. Let's go through each  section that you need to update:  @bm-primary: 673ab7; @bm-dark-primary: 512da8; @bm-light-primary: d1c4e9; @bm-accent: e040fb; @bm-black: 212121; @bm-grey: 727272; @bm-light-grey: b6b6b6;  As we did in the previous wiki project, we're going to use the primary naming  convention for our custom colors. Each one is prepended with bm- in order to   make it easily identifiable.  Background colors Next, let's update our background color variables to use our new color values:  @primary-background: @white; @secondary-background: @bm-grey; @inverse-background: @bm-black;   Text colors After setting up the background, let's move on to updating our text color variables   to use the new values:  @primary-text: @bm-grey;  @light-text: @bm-light-grey;  @loud-text: @bm-black;  @inverse-text: @white;  @heading-text: @bm-black;   Link colors For the links, we're going to use our primary color for the link and the dark primary  color for the hover state:  @primary-link-color: @bm-primary;  @primary-link-color-hover: @bm-dark-primary;   [ 173 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Borders For the project's borders, we're only going to update the colors for the primary and  focus border states. The size and type values will stay the same:  @border-color: @light-grey;  @border-size: 1px; @border-type: solid; @border-focus: @bm-accent;  Typography The typography values will more or less be the same, but with one change. Since  this is a magazine, I'm going to bump up the base font size to 16px. We want our  magazine to be easy to read, so it makes sense that we should make the type larger.  Also make sure that the font stack is set up properly, with Source Sans Pro   spelled properly:  @body-copy: "Source Sans Pro", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial,   verdana, sans-serif;  @heading-copy: "Source Sans Pro", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica,   arial, verdana, sans-serif;  @base-font-size: 16px;   new @font-size: 1em; @base-line-height: 1.5;   Border radius The last thing that I'm going to do is change the border-radius value to 5px. I  thought I'd mix up the look a little by making our corners more rounded:  .round-corners  @radius: 5px  {   -moz-border-radius: @radius;   -ms-border-radius: @radius;   border-radius: @radius; }     color palette  @black: 000; @dark-grey: 333; @grey: ccc;  This completes the updates that you need to make to the variables' Less file.

It will include a logo, some  post filter links, and a search field. The footer for this project, however, is the most  complex one we've done yet. It will include two sections, a number of links, an  e-mail sign-up form, and space for an advertisement—any good magazine design  will include some space for ads.  Updating the header Let's start with updating the header first. For this project, I'm going to use a couple   of HTML5 tags to mix things up. For each project in this book, I try to change how   I build the header to show you that there are several ways by which you can  construct a header. Some will use the default Bootstrap header, but some will be  totally custom. The first thing that we're going to do is wrap the entire header in   the   tag:  Everything contained within the header is going to be centered horizontally, so let's  apply a single style to this tag:      …    header {   text-align: center; }  Inserting the logo Next we'll insert a new   tag for the logo. Once you've inserted the following  HTML, open up the theme.less file and insert the corresponding styles:       <img src="img bootmag-logo.png" width="234"     height="67" alt="Bootmag">     The logo needs a top margin so that it doesn't bump against the top edge of the  browser. It will inherit the center styling from the   tag:  .logo {   margin-top:  @margin * 2 ; }  [ 177 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the filters Directly after the logo, we are going to insert a second   tag for our filters.  Within the wrapping parent   tag, I've inserted a number of child     tags, one for each filter:                All               Design               Illustration               Painting               Web      For the wrapping .filters  , we are going to add top and bottom margins:  We want the child   tags to be displayed in a line horizontally and centered  within the overall layout. To achieve this, we will use the display property with   a value of inline-block. We'll then add left and right margins to each to space   them out:  I'm going to change the appearance of the filter links to be different from that of our  primary links. Add the following styles to theme.less:  .filters {   margin:  @margin * 2  0; }  .filters div {   display: inline-block;   margin: 0  @margin * 2 ; }  .filters a {   color: @bm-black; }  .filters a:hover {   color: @bm-accent; }  [ 178 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the search field The last piece of the header that we need to add is the search field. Immediately after  the filters   tag, insert the following block of code:                                            <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Search">                                      For this component, we're wrapping a generic Bootstrap form within a   tag  with a class of .search on it. We'll need to add some custom styles to the form to  achieve the look that we want:  .search form {   width: 200px;   margin: 0 auto; }  .search input {   width: 200px;    -moz-border-radius: 20px;   border-radius: 20px; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the search form:  I've set width of form and input to 200px, so it isn't too long.        Setting text-align to center won't work with a form. So, I've set the left   and right margin to auto to center it in the layout. I've bumped up the border-radius on the actual input to 20px so that I get  the circular look at the ends of the field.      [ 179 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the form Less component For the search field, we need to customize one of the default Bootstrap form styles.  When the input is in focus, I want the border to use our color palette. Create a new  file in css components called _forms.less and insert the following code:  .form-control:focus {   border-color: @border-focus;   box-shadow: none; }  Don't forget to @import the new _forms.less file into theme.less. That completes  the design of our header. As I explained, this should've been pretty straightforward.  Before we move on to the footer, let's review the entire code for the header:                                           <img src="img bootmag-logo.png" width="234"             height="67" alt="Bootmag">                                  All               Design               Illustration               Painting               Web                                                               <input type="text" class="form-control"                 placeholder="Search">                                                          [ 180 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Updating the footer As I mentioned early in this chapter, the footer for this project is the most  complicated one yet. It will be divided into a top and a bottom section and the design  is in line with footers that you would see on other magazine-style websites. Similar  to the header design, I want to strive to give you something that is a little different in  each project. As we did with the header, we're going to wrap the entire footer in the  HTML5   tag:  The actual   tag doesn't have any styles attached to it, but it's a good way   to group the top and bottom sections of the overall section. Before we jump into   the footer sections, let's customize the links styles for both in theme.less:  Coding the top of the footer The top section of the footer is divided into four columns. The first two columns  contain unordered lists of links, the third column will hold a newsletter sign-up  form, and the final column will be a placeholder for an advertisement. We want   the footer to stretch across the full width of the browser, so we won't use the  .container   here. I'll wrap the top section in a .footer-top     and then start a regular Bootstrap grid within it:      ..    .footer-top a, .footer-bottom a {   color: @white;   text-decoration: none; }  .footer-top a:hover, .footer-bottom a:hover {   color: @bm-light-grey; }                    ..                   ..        [ 181 ]  www.it-ebooks.info               ..                   ..              Let's breakdown the CSS for the footer:     The first two columns use the .col-lg-2 class. They don't need to be very   wide as they just have a list of links.     The third column is a bit wider in order to allow more space for our   newsletter sign-up form. As part of this section, we'll update our   Button styles.     The final column is the widest and is offset by 1 to give some space around   for our ad. As part of this section, we'll update our Well styles.  At this point, let's set up the styles for the .footer-top class, which wraps this  entire section. We're going to set the background to black, set the text to white, and  add some padding:  .footer-top {   background: @bm-black;   color: @white;   padding:  @padding * 2 ; }  Adding the first two columns The first two columns are pretty simple—just a couple of unordered lists that use the  Bootstrap unstyled list class:       Categories            Art         Design         Illustration         Painting         Web         Street Art    [ 182 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         Mixed Media              Help &amp; Support            FAQ         Terms of Use         Contact Support         About         Advertise         Meetups          .footer-top h5 {   text-transform: uppercase;   color: @bm-accent;   font-size:  @font-size - 0.25 ;   letter-spacing: 1px; }  This section is straightforward, but I will add some custom styles to the   tag,  which are shown here:  Adding the newsletter form Let's move on to the third column and add the form for the newsletter. Insert the  following code after the first two columns:       Newsletter     Sign up for the Bootmag email list to keep up to date on all     the latest news.                               Sign Up         This section should also be pretty easy to understand. We're using a basic Bootstrap  form combined with some type tags. One thing that we need to do here is update our  button styles.  [ 183 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Updating the button styles The button used in the form is the first instance in this project, so let's go ahead   and update our styles. Create a new file called _buttons.less and save it in   css components. Next, head to theme.less and @import it into theme.less.   Once that's set up, insert the following code into the new Less file:  .btn {   text-transform: uppercase; }  .btn-primary {   background: @bm-primary;   border-color: @bm-primary;   color: @white; }  .btn-primary:hover {   background: @bm-dark-primary;   border-color: @bm-dark-primary; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the button component:     All the buttons are going to be uppercase     I have reset the primary button static and hover states to use the color palette  This completes the third column in the first part of footer. Let's move on to the final  column, which holds the advertisement.  Coding the advertisement section We're going to make the advertisement section the widest so that it can support a  larger ad if needed. We're also going to offset it by 1 to add some space. This will  make the ad more noticeable, which is what you would want if you're using an ad   on your magazine website:       Advertisement           ad        [ 184 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I'm using a .advertisement class here and some other custom styles, so let's take a  look at what's going on:  .advertisement {   text-align: center; }  .advertisement .well {   margin: 0  @margin * 4 ; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the .advertisement class:          I want to center this section, so I've added the text-align property to the  .advertisement class. I also want to add some more margin to the Well component that holds the  advertisement. Speaking of the Well component, we need to update it.   Updating the well styles Create a new file named _well.less and save it in css components. Next, open  theme.less and @import the new Less file  into theme.less. Once you've done   that, insert the following styles:  .well {   border: 0;   box-shadow: none;   background-color: @secondary-background;   .round-corners; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the .well component:  I've removed the well's border and box-shadow        Next, we'll want to use our background-color variable    Finally, let's reset border-radius to use our Less mixin  This brings the fourth column to a close, as well as the top of the footer. Let's move  on to the bottom of this section to finish it.  [ 185 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Coding the bottom of the footer The bottom part of the footer is simpler than its top. This section is divided into two  equal columns. On the left, we have the standard copyright statement, and on the  right, we have social media icon links. Let's take a look at the code:                    Copyright 2015 Bootmag                               <i class="fa fa-facebook-          official">              <i class="fa fa-twitter-          square">              <i class="fa fa-github-          square">              <i class="fa fa-linkedin-          square">              <i class="fa fa-google-plus-          square">              <i class="fa fa-pinterest-          square">                         As with the top of the footer, we have some styles specific to the bottom. The  background will use our primary color, white text, and the same padding as the top:  The last thing that we should cover is the social media links. As with the header  section, I'm using a collection of  s here, which are displayed as inline-block.  This   tag also floats to the right, so it aligns to the right side of the column:  .footer-bottom {   background: @bm-primary;   color: @white;   padding:  @padding * 2 ; }  .social-media div {   display: inline-block;   margin: 0  @margin - 0.5 ;   float: right; }  [ 186 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This brings the footer to a close. Let's review all of the markup together before we  move on to coding the Homepage template:                               Categories                        Art               Design               Illustration               Painting               Web               Street Art               Mixed Media                                    Help &amp; Support                        FAQ               Terms of Use               Contact Support               About               Advertise               Meetups                                      Newsletter           Sign up for the Bootmag email list to keep up to date           on all the latest news.

Once you have confirmed that your project is set up properly, you can move on to  the Homepage layout.  Coding the home page The first of two templates for this project is the home page. This page is made up   of a flexbox grid that is wrapped into the Bootstrap grid code. Following the grid,  we'll add a pagination section. The entire body of the page is wrapped in the  following HTML:      ..    [ 188 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This section has top and bottom margins attached to it. This is the same spacing that  we'll use on the article page, so you'll see .article class in there as well:  .page-body, .article {   margin:  @margin * 2  0; }  Creating a post grid with flexbox Before we jump fully into the flexbox code, let's outline the basic structure of a row  of posts. Each row of our grid will have four posts in it. As with the footer, we want  rows to stretch across the width of the layout, so we'll be omitting the .container   . Here's the basic structure of a row:                              ..                         ..                         ..                         ..                      Let's breakdown the CSS for the flexbox layout:     We're wrapping a full-width Bootstrap grid around our flexbox layout    The .flex-parent is the wrapper for this row of posts    The .flex-child is the class for every post or child of .flex-parent  [ 189 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The code for each flex child   looks like what is shown next. It's made up of an  image and a post title. You can easily add more content to the section if you like:              Article Title      Let's take a look at the styles that power this section of the layout. There are a few  things that we need to review to get our flexbox to work properly. First, create a new  file called _flexbox.less and save it in css components. After that, open theme. less and @import the new file. Go back to the Less file and insert the following code:  .flex-parent {   display: flex;   display: -webkit-flex; }  .flex-child {   width: 100%;   flex: 1;   background: @off-white;   margin: 10px;   height: auto;   padding: 10px;    .round-corners; }  .flex-child img {   width: 100%;    .round-corners; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the flexbox layout:     Our .flex-parent class simply needs to have its display property set to   flex. Don't forget the webkit value too.     The child needs a little more work. Set width to 100% so that the @off-white   background fills the width of the column. We set flex to 1, and we'll need  to add some margin and padding since this is not a regular Bootstrap grid.  Finally, set height to auto so that the background will grow to fit its content.  Don't forget to reset border-radius too.  [ 190 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      We also need to add some styles for the image that appears in each column.   It's a good idea to use a larger image here as the width of this column is fluid.  By setting the image width to 100%, we can be sure that the image will fit in  the box properly. Setting height to auto will allow it to resize properly.  Now that we've finished a single row of four posts, it's just a matter of adding more  rows of four. We need to add the pagination controls to this layout next. Then I'll  show you what all of the markup should look like.  Adding the pagination section For the pagination of this project, we're going to use a mobile pattern. Instead of  traditional pagination, which has a page count, we're just going to insert a Load  More button and use an infinite scrolling pattern. Start by adding the following  HTML after the grid code:                               Load More                       You'd see that I'm using a container here, which is perfectly fine. I don't need this  part of the layout to stretch the width of the browser. You'll notice that on the grid  class  , I've also added a class of .pagination. The following styles apply to  this class:  .pagination {   text-align: center;   margin:  @margin * 2  0; }   I've centered the entire section and added top and bottom margins for spacing. This  brings the pagination section to an end. The idea here is that you would click on the  button and another row or two of posts would load in. This will go on infinitely or  until you run out of posts to show. Let's take a look at the entire HTML code for this  template:                       [ 191 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                       Article Title                                                 Article Title                                                 Article Title                                                 Article Title                                                                                     Article Title                                                 Article Title                                                 Article Title                                                 Article Title                                    [ 192 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                                     Article Title                                                 Article Title                                                 Article Title                                                 Article Title                                                                           Load More                                 [ 193 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Coding the article template The second template in this project is the article or post template. It will contain the  detailed view and content for a magazine story. Before we start coding the page, let's  see what it will look like:  [ 194 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The layout here is narrower, which allows easier readability of a large amount of  content. I've also followed my regular minimal style to keep the page looking really  clean. The entire page template is wrapped in a   tag with a class of .article  so that we can apply some styling:  We had already added the styles for this when we set up our .page-body class in the  previous template. However, there is a container class inside of the .article class  that needs some customization:      ..    .article .container {   padding-left:  @padding * 18 ;   padding-right:  @padding * 18 ; }  This might look like a decent amount of padding, and it is. This is how we will  achieve the narrower column layout that we want for better readability.  Adding the article title First things first, let's add our page title. Like any good page title, ours is wrapped in  an   tag:   This is the title for the story it can get kinda big if we want it  to eh.   Let's take a look at the styles that are being applied to this header tag:  .article h1 {   text-align: center;   margin: 0;   margin-bottom:  @margin - 0.5 ;   line-height: 1.3;   font-weight: 700;   color: @bm-black; }  [ 195 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's breakdown the CSS for our article section of the page:     The text-align is set to center for the entire title     I've removed the default Bootstrap margin on the   tag and then   re-added a bottom margin I've tweaked the default line-height a bit to make it more readable        Finally, the type is set to bold and our black  Adding the article metadata After finishing the page title, let's cover the article or post meta markup. The meta  section lists the post category as a link, and the author's name:      Posted in  Design  by John Smith    There are also a few styles that you need to add for the metadata section:  I've added a bottom margin to the section        The text-align here is centered again, and the text color is set to use    our palette  .article-meta {   margin-bottom:  @margin * 2 ;   text-align: center;   color: @bm-light-grey; }  Adding the article content We're now ready to jump into the actual content section of a post. There is no special  wrapper for this section, but I will add a bottom margin to each image in this section  to create more space:  .article img {   margin-bottom:  @margin * 2 ; }  Following this, it's simply an exercise of entering content for the actual article. At the  end of this section, I'll insert the entire page code so that you can see some sample  content. For now, let's move on to the comments section of the post.  [ 196 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the comment section The comment section of the article template is going to be a two-part exercise. First,  we're going to use some jQuery to reveal the comment feed at the click of a button.  Then we're going to implement a Disqus comment system. Let's start with the  custom jQuery that we'll need to power the button effect.  Creating the custom article layout  To start, open the _layout-article.ejs file in the root of the project that I had you  create earlier in the chapter. Also open up _layout.ejs. Copy the entire content of  the file and then paste it in the new layout file. Scroll to the bottom of the template,  and after the line where we import bootstrap.min.js, insert a new     tag. Within the   tag, insert the following jQuery code. Then we'll go   over each line:        $ document .ready function   {       $ "comment-container" .hide  ;       $ "comment-trigger" .click function  {         $ "comment-container" .fadeIn  ;         $ "comment-trigger" .fadeOut  ;       } ;     } ;      I'm going to assume that you know a little bit about jQuery and know what   document .ready does. If not, just insert that line and move on to the next one.  You're going to see some IDs here that we haven't set up yet in our template.   After I review the jQuery, we'll insert the related code into article.ejs:  $ "comment-container" .hide  ;  In this line, we're going to target the comment-container   and hide it using  the .hide   method. When the page first loads, we don't want the comment section  to show up, so we need to hide it:  $ "comment-trigger" .click function  {   .. } ;  [ 197 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, we need to set up a click function that will be attached to a button with the  comment-trigger ID. The code inside this function will be executed once the   user clicks on the button. Here's what the entire function looks like:  $ "comment-trigger" .click function  {   $ "comment-container" .fadeIn  ;    $ "comment-trigger" .fadeOut  ;  } ;  We're doing two things here on the button click. The first thing we want to do is  reveal the comment-container  , and I'm using the .fadeIn   method for  a subtle effect. The next thing I'm going to do is remove the Load Comments button,  and I'll use the .fadeOut   method to do this. This completes the jQuery code that  you need to include in the layout. Let's save the file, get back to the article.ejs  template, and insert the corresponding HTML code.  Adding the trigger button Scroll to the bottom of the template, and at the end of your post content, insert the  following code:       Load     Comments     The first thing I've done here is creating a new   with a class of .center on  it. This is a new utility class that you can use to center anything in your templates.  Jump over to theme.less quickly and insert this CSS for the utility class:  .center {   text-align: center; }  Since the button is inside of our post column, this class will center the button in the  layout. Next, I've created a button, and note that it's using the comment-trigger   ID that we added in the layout. This part is critical for the button click to work.  Adding the Disqus content component  Now that the button is ready to roll, let's set up the comments container  . After  our button code, we insert the following markup:      ..    [ 198 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As I mentioned, this is going to be the container for our comments. Note that the  ID matches the one that we set up in the layout. Again, this is critical to making the  effect work. The next thing you need to do is register for a Disqus account to get  the code that will generate your comments feed for you. Head over to https:   publishers.disqus.com and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.  Once you've signed up, follow these steps:     Enter your website details when prompted to do so    Click on the Universal Code option    Copy the code that appears and paste it in the comments-container       Insert the second piece of code from the Disqus page in _layout-article. ejs, at the bottom right before the closing   tag  Now save your template and the layout and compile your code. Open the article  template in the browser and refresh the page. Hit the Load Comments button and  wait for a couple seconds the first time for the comment feed to load. If all goes well,  your Disqus comments feed should load, and you now have a great component that  you can use. Here's an example of what the entire section should look like in your  template. Please keep in mind that this code is configured for my website, so you  can't do a straight copy and paste. You need to use the code snippet that is provided  when you sign up for your account:       Load Comments<  button>                     * * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES * * *        var disqus_shortname = 'bootstrapblueprints';               * * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * *         function   {           var dsq = document.createElement 'script' ; dsq.type =             'text javascript'; dsq.async = true;           dsq.src = '  ' + disqus_shortname +             '.disqus.com embed.js';            document.getElementsByTagName 'head' [0]              document.getElementsByTagName 'body' [0]             .appendChild dsq ;       }   ;      [ 199 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Please enable JavaScript to view the <a     href="https:  disqus.com ?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments     powered by Disqus.      That completes the article template and the project. Before we move on to the  chapter's summary, let's review the code for the entire article.ejs file:                               This is the title for the story it can get kinda big             if we want it to eh.

Summary That brings the fifth chapter to a close. Let's review what you learned: how to create  a magazine website using Bootstrap, a new way to lay out a header using inline div,  how to construct a complex footer using multiple parts, how to use flexbox with  a Bootstrap grid, how to use some basic jQuery to improve the experience of your  article page, and how to implement a Disqus-powered comments section.  [ 201 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Bootstrap Dashboard  In this chapter, I'm going to show you how to create a dashboard using Bootstrap.  For a change, we'll make a dark-colored design and implement a number of  components commonly found on a dashboard. Part of this exercise will teach you  how to integrate a third-party chart library and customize it to work in Bootstrap.  We'll also cover customizations of a few components that we have not used yet,   such as navigation pills, panels, and tables.   [ 203 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before we dive into updating our template, let's take a look at what we'll be creating:  [ 204 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Customizing the template As in our other projects, we start by copying our boilerplate project to a new  directory called chapter6. Open the _data.json file and insert the following code:  {   "index": {     "pageTitle": "Dashboard" }  For this project, we're only creating one page template. Let's start by creating a file  in the root of our project. For now, just leave the file blank; we'll fill it in a bit later:  index.ejs.  Updating _layout.ejs Next, let's update the _layout.ejs file in the root of our new project. The layout  for this project will need a few more things that we haven't seen before. First of all,  insert the following line of code to import the Google web font Roboto, which we'll  be using for our dashboard:  <link href='https:  fonts.googleapis.com  css?family=Roboto:400,300,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>  For this project, we're going to use a third-party chart library to draw some pie charts  and line graphs. I've decided to use a library called Chartist. This library   is a simple, responsive charts option that will give us exactly what we need. Head  over to the following URL and download the library:  https:  gionkunz.github.io chartist-js   Once you've downloaded the library, unzip it and then copy a couple of files to your  project. Locate the file named chartist.min.css and copy it to your  css directory.  Also, find the file named chartist.min.js and copy it to the  js directory. Once  you've copied the files, you need to insert them into the layout. Add the following  line of code to the layout after font-awesome.min.css. Also make sure that your  theme.css is inserted after the Chartist CSS. Later on, we're going to overwrite some  of the styles in the library:     Next, we need to include the JavaScript library file. Insert the following line of code  after bootstrap.min.js:      [ 205 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We also need to include another JavaScript file. This file will hold our custom  code that will render our charts on the dashboard page. First, create a file named  bootboard-charts.js in the  js directory. You can leave it blank for now. Next,   go back to the layout and insert the following line of code after chartist.min.js:      This completes the updates we need for the layout. Let's check out what the entire  file looks like:                                    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="css font-awesome.min. css">           <link href='https:  fonts.googleapis.com  css?family=Roboto:400,300,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>    <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements and  media queries -->   <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via  file:   -->         <script src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com html5shiv 3.7.2 html5shiv.min. js">      <script src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com respond 1.4.2 respond.min. js">                              [ 206 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         <script src="  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.11.1 jquery. min.js">               <  script>      Setting up the Less variables Now that we've finished our layout, it's time to move on to updating our Less  variables. For this project, I'm not going to add any new colors. We're going to fall  back to the colors from our original boilerplate. I want to give you a good example   of how it's useful to have these stock colors for use on a project.  Background colors Let's start by updating our background colors to use our boilerplate color values. As  you'll see, I'm using @black for the primary background. This is because we're going  to make this a dark colored design:  @primary-background: @black; @secondary-background: @dark-grey; @inverse-background: @white;  Text colors Next, let's update our text colors and invert them to be readable on a dark  background:  @primary-text: @white; @light-text: @dark-grey; @loud-text: @white; @inverse-text: @white; @heading-text: @light-grey;  Link colors The same inverse color approach will be used to set the values for our links:  @primary-link-color: @light-grey; @primary-link-color-hover: @white;  [ 207 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Borders Again, we'll update the border colors to match our new dark design:  @border-color: @dark-grey; @border-size: 1px; @border-type: solid; @border-focus: @light-grey;  Typography For the typography of this project, I've decided to switch the font to Roboto. You'll  need to update the two typeface variables to reflect this:  @body-copy: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; @heading-copy: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;  This completes the updates that you need to make to the variables Less file. Look  how easy it was using the stock color values! You didn't even need to think about  the colors; you only had to think how you wanted to apply them. That process was  super easy too! If you are working on a large number of projects or themes, this type  of time saver will be invaluable to you. Let's take a look at the entire variables file  before we move on to the header and footer:     color palette   @black: 000; @dark-grey: 333; @grey: 777; @light-grey: ebebeb; @off-white: f5f5f5; @white: ffffff;  @blue1: 3498db; @blue2: 2980b9; @red1: e74c3c; @red2: c0392b; @yellow1: f1c40f; @yellow2: f39c12; @green1: 2ecc71; @green2: 27ae60; @orange1: e67e22; @orange2: d35400; @aqua1: 1abc9c; @aqua2: 16a085; @purple1: 9b59b6;  [ 208 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   @purple2: 8e44ad; @navy1: 34495e; @navy2: 2c3e50;     background colors  @primary-background: @black;  @secondary-background: @dark-grey;  @inverse-background: @white;      text colors  @primary-text: @white;  @light-text: @dark-grey;  @loud-text: @white;  @inverse-text: @white; @heading-text: @light-grey;     link colors @primary-link-color: @light-grey; @primary-link-color-hover: @white;     primary border properties  @border-color: @dark-grey; @border-size: 1px; @border-type: solid; @border-focus: @light-grey;     layout  @margin: 1em; @padding: 1em;     MIXINS     round corners or Border radius .round-corners  @radius: 2px  {   -moz-border-radius: @radius;   -ms-border-radius: @radius;   border-radius: @radius;  [ 209 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     typography NEW fonts @body-copy: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;  @heading-copy: "Roboto", helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;  @base-font-size: 14px; @font-size: 1em; @base-line-height: 1.5;    }     animation transitions .transition  @transition: background .1s linear  {   -moz-transition: @transition;   -webkit-transition: @transition;   transition: background @transition; }  Coding the header and footer Let's now proceed to code the header and footer for the project. The header will use  the default Bootstrap navbar with some color customizations. We'll also be inserting  a search form and some other text into the header. Our footer will be super basic,  with only a few social media icons and a copyright statement.  Updating the header Let's start out by creating the header, and then we'll customize it. Here's the code   for the entire thing:                    <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data- toggle="collapse" data-target="bootboard-nav">          Toggle navigation                                                  Bootstrap Dashboard<  span>                                                                          [ 210 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           John Smith                      The first important thing to note here is the responsive button line of code. You'll  notice the data-target attribute is pointing to bootboard-nav. This nav is not  actually in the header; it will be the sidebar navigation. If you're viewing this on a  mobile device, the sidebar will disappear and the links will be rolled into the mobile  navigation list of links:  <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse"  data-target="bootboard-nav">  The next part that we should review is the markup for the search input:                     This is our standard navbar search field, but I've applied some custom styles to the  field to give it round corners. Create a new file called _navbar.less and save it  in the css components directory. Also, don't forget to import _navbar.less into  theme.less. In _navbar.less, insert the following code:  .navbar-form input {   -moz-border-radius: 20px;   border-radius: 20px;   border: 0;   background: @dark-grey;   color: @white;   margin-top: -5px; }  Here, you'll see that I've set border-radius to 20px to get that rounded ends look.  I've also customized the colors to match our dark color scheme, and I need to apply  a bit of negative margin to vertically center the field in the navbar. I'll get deeper  into the customization of the navbar component a little later. The last things that we  should review are the username and icon on the right-hand side of the navbar:                [ 211 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       John Smith        On the   tag, I've added the .navbar-right Bootstrap utility class, which will  align the list on the right-hand side of the page. I'm also using a Font Awesome   icon here for the user. The last three points are the key things you need to keep in  mind while coding this component. Now, let's move on to all the styles required   to customize the look and feel of the navigation bar.  Customizing the navbar component Go back to the _navbar.less file that you recently created. We're going to insert  some more styles for our component:  I've set the background of the navbar to use our primary background color, which  is black. I've also reset the margins to use our global value. We're going to use the  default Bootstrap navbar, but we'll need to make a bunch of changes:  .navbar {   background: @primary-background;   margin-bottom: @margin; }  .navbar-default .navbar-brand {   font-family: @heading-copy;   font-weight: 400;   font-size:  @font-size * 2 ;   height: 72px;   line-height: 72px;   padding: 0;  }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the .navbar component:     Using the .brand class, I'm going to set it to use our heading copy variable.    We'll set font-weight to regular and double the font-size.     I'm going to set the height and line-height of the brand to 72px. This is   a little trick to vertically center everything in our navbar.     Finally, I'm going to remove the default padding so that everything lines    up vertically.  [ 212 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's continue editing the brand by setting up some hover and color styles. You'll  notice in the HTML that part of the title is wrapped in a   tag. This will allow  me to target that word and give it a different color:  .navbar-default .navbar-brand:hover,  .navbar-default .navbar-brand:hover span {   color: @blue1; }  .navbar-default .navbar-brand span {   color: @blue1;   font-weight: 300; }  I've also reduced the font-weight of the brand   to light or 300. On hovering  over the brand, both words will turn blue. This creates a subtle but attractive little  effect. Let's continue and customize the actual default navbar styles:  .navbar-default {   border: 0;   border-bottom: @border-size @border-type @border-color;   margin: 0;   margin-bottom:  @margin * 2 ;   line-height: 72px;   height: 72px;    border-radius: 0;   -moz-border-radius: 0; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the .navbar a little more:          I've removed all borders from the navbar, but then I've added the bottom- border back in. I did it this way because I first want to neutralize the  Bootstrap styles before I apply my own. I've also removed the margin so that the vertical centering doesn't get messed  up. However, I've added some bottom-margin to create some space below  the navbar.     Again, I set the height and line-height to 72px so that everything is centered   vertically.  [ 213 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Finally, I removed border-radius. This is because I want the navbar and   background to blend in together perfectly: .navbar-collapse {   padding-left: 0;   padding-right: 0; }  I've removed the default left and right padding from the collapsible navbar for the  same reasons as I removed border-radius. There's one last style that we need to add:  .navbar-form {   margin: 0; }  Finally, I've removed the margin from the navbar form so that it doesn't mess  up the vertical centering of the component. This brings the navbar component  customization to an end. Let's proceed to set up the footer, and then we can move   on to the actual body of our dashboard.  Updating the footer The footer for the dashboard project is pretty straightforward. It's made up of a  copyright statement and social media links. Let's take a look at the HTML:                                                <  a>                 <  li>                <  li>                <  li>            &copy; 2015 Bootstrap Dashboard                                 [ 214 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I've wrapped the entire footer in the HTML5   tag. Within that is a container  with a Bootstrap inline list. Each list item uses the Font Awesome icon set and then a  copyright statement. There are also a few footer styles to review:  footer {   margin-top:  @padding * 6 ;   padding-bottom:  @padding * 2 ;   padding-top:  @padding * 2 ;   border-top: @border-size @border-color @border-type;   color: @light-text; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the footer:      I've added a top margin in order to add some spacing between the content  and the footer I've also added a little bottom padding for breathing space        Then, I've added a top border to act as a divider    There is some top padding so as to add space between the list and the border    Finally, I set the text color to light  This completes the updates to all our standard template pieces. Next, we'll move on  to coding the main content section of the dashboard.  Coding the dashboard The main body of the dashboard is going to hold the main portion of this project.  We'll start by setting up the two-column layout, followed by inserting the sidebar  with pill-based navigation. Next, we'll update the typography styles and insert pie  charts. Finally, we'll customize the Bootstrap panel and table components and add   a line chart for good measure.  Setting up the layout The dashboard is going to use a two-column layout. The left column will be our  sidebar navigation, and it will use the Bootstrap pill component. The right-side will  hold our page content with charts, panels, and tables. If you haven't already done so,  create a file named index.ejs in the root of your project and enter the layout code:         [ 215 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                                  This layout code is very straightforward. I've created a 1:4 grid system. Let's move on  to setting up the sidebar.  Creating the sidebar The sidebar is going to use the Bootstrap pill navigation component. Let's start by  coding a basic list of pages first. Then, we'll add the custom pill styles that we need   to update:                        Control Panel          Dashboard           Applications           Documentation           Analytics           Discussion           Users          Account          Profile           Settings           Help           Logout                [ 216 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Within the parent  , there is   with the Bootstrap collapsible   navigation classes. In a mobile viewport, this list of links will be grabbed  and inserted into the mobile menu. It's important to note that you can grab  any list of links and make it a mobile navigation if you use the write code  structure. You aren't restricted to using only the default navigation bar. Inside that collapsible  , there is a   with some nav pill classes on   the  . These are the classes that will change the regular list into a pill  navigation.         Some   tags have a class of .navigation-header on them. These are the   category names for our navigation, and they will be styled differently.  Customizing the nav pills component Thus, we have completed the HTML for the navigation. Let's now take a look at the  custom styles that we need to add. Start by creating a new Less file called _navs. less and save it to the css components directory. Before we code the pill-specific  CSS, we need to update this global nav component. We'll customize the actual pill  styles next. For now, insert the following CSS into the nav file:  .nav-stacked > li + li {   margin-top: @margin; }  .nav > li > a:focus,  .nav > li > a:hover {   background-color: @blue1;   color: @white; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the navigation links:     The first selector will add a top margin to each list item.    The second set of styles will set the link colors for our navigation list. As you   can see, we're using our color palette variables here.  [ 217 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, let's create the pills CSS. Create another Less file and name it _pills.less.  Import it into theme.less. Within _pills.less, insert the following CSS:  These styles set the link text and background colors for the active pill or page in our  navigation. You can set the active link by adding a class of .active to the   tag for  the current page. In this case, it should be set to Dashboard.  Before we can complete the sidebar, we need to add styles for our navigation  category headers. Open theme.less, scroll down to the Layout section, and   insert the following CSS:  .nav-pills > li > a {   color: @grey; }  .nav-pills > li.active > a,  .nav-pills > li.active > a:focus,  .nav-pills > li.active > a:hover {   background-color: @dark-grey; }  li.navigation-header {   color: @blue1;   text-transform: uppercase;   font-size:  @font-size - 0.25 ;   letter-spacing: 1px;   font-weight: 700;   margin-bottom: @margin 0;   padding-left: 15px; }  These styles will give the navigation category headers a unique look so that they  stand out from the regular navigation links.  That completes the sidebar navigation portion of the dashboard. Next, I'll go over  how to build the content section of the project.  Creating the content section The content section of the dashboard will be made up of pie charts, panels, tables,  and line charts. We'll also use the Bootstrap page header component and customize  some other text styles. Let's start with the page section headers.  [ 218 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Customizing the typography There is a page header component in Bootstrap that will add some spacing and a  border to a section header so that it stands out more. Let's take a look at the HTML  for this component:                     Charts  A quick view of your website stats <  h3>              Let's breakdown the CSS for the project's typography:     Within my content section, using the col-lg-9 grid class, I'm going to insert  a number of new row classes for each part of the page body. Since we want  the section header to span the entire width of the parent  , we'll use the  col-lg-12 grid class here.     Within that  , we'll use the .page-header class to invoke that   component.     Then, within the page header, I'll use an   tag for my section title.    You'll also notice a   tag nested in  , which is a feature of the page  header component. This allows you to add a smaller piece of text next to the  title. This is great for adding a short description, as I've done here.  Before we move on to the pie charts, we need to customize the page header   styles a little. Create a new Less file called _typography.less and save it to   the css components directory. Don't forget to import it into theme.less. Within   _typography.less, insert the following CSS:  .page-header {   border-bottom: @border-size @border-type @border-color; }  All I've done here is normalized the border for this component so that it uses our  look and feel. Let's move on to the pie chart section of the dashboard.  [ 219 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Writing the pie chart HTML The pie chart portion of the dashboard is rendered using a JavaScript chart library  called Chartist. We previously included the Chartist library when we set up our  layout. Now we actually need to use it. We're going to divide the section into three  equal columns and then insert a chart into each:                             Impressions                            Clicks                            Sales              Let's breakdown the HTML for the pie charts:      I've wrapped the entire row in a class of .charts, which we'll use to add  some styling a little later. I divided the row into three equal columns using the col-lg-4 grid class.        Within each column is a   for a chart. These   will be empty as we'll   be loading in the chart with JavaScript.     Note that each   has a unique class for each chart, for example, ch-  chart-one. This is required so that we can make each chart different.     There is a second class called ct-perfect-fourth that defines the type  of chart we want to use. Check out the Chartist documentation for more  information on how this works at https:  gionkunz.github.io  chartist-js getting-started.html.  Now that we've coded the HTML for the pie charts, we need to move on to the  JavaScript. Following that, we'll customize the pie chart look and feel with some CSS.  [ 220 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Writing the pie chart JavaScript This project marks the first time we'll write some custom JavaScript. Start by creating  a new file called bootboard-chart.js and save it to the  js directory in your  project. Next, we insert the following JavaScript for our first chart:     first pie chart var data = {   series: [5, 3, 4] };  var sum = function a, b  { return a + b };  new Chartist.Pie '.ct-chart-one', data, {   labelInterpolationFnc: function value  {     return Math.round value   data.series.reduce sum  * 100  + '%';   } } ;  Let's breakdown the JavaScript for the chart:     Don't let the JavaScript intimidate you. There is actually very little that we   need to change here.     Take a look at the series: line of code and you'll see three numerical values.   This is how our chart will be divided. It doesn't really matter what these  numbers are; you just need three of them.     Next, jump to the new Chartist.Pie line. Notice that there is a CSS class on  this line. This is the class that we entered in our first chart  . Make sure  that the class name matches and save your file. That's all you need to update.  Let's take a look at the JavaScript for the second pie chart. It's very similar to the first  pie chart, but we're going to change a few values:     second pie chart var data = {   series: [8, 1, 7] };  var sum = function a, b  { return a + b };  new Chartist.Pie '.ct-chart-two', data, {   labelInterpolationFnc: function value  {  [ 221 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       return Math.round value   data.series.reduce sum  * 100  + '%';   } } ;  Let's breakdown the second pie chart:     Note that the values in the series: array have changed, so the chart will be   divided differently I've also changed the class to point to our second        Finally, let's check out the JavaScript for the last chart:     third pie chart var data = {   series: [7, 3, 9] };  var sum = function a, b  { return a + b };  new Chartist.Pie '.ct-chart-three', data, {   labelInterpolationFnc: function value  {     return Math.round value   data.series.reduce sum  * 100  + '%';   } } ;  Let's breakdown the last pie chart:     Like the previous two, I've updated the numbers in the series: array to be   different I've also changed the class name to make it unique and match our third         Let's take a look at all of the chart code together:     first pie chart var data = {   series: [5, 3, 4] };  var sum = function a, b  { return a + b };  new Chartist.Pie '.ct-chart-one', data, {  [ 222 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     labelInterpolationFnc: function value  {     return Math.round value   data.series.reduce sum  * 100  + '%';   } } ;     second pie chart var data = {   series: [8, 1, 7] };     third pie chart var data = {   series: [7, 3, 9] };  var sum = function a, b  { return a + b };  new Chartist.Pie '.ct-chart-two', data, {   labelInterpolationFnc: function value  {     return Math.round value   data.series.reduce sum  * 100  + '%';   } } ;  var sum = function a, b  { return a + b };  new Chartist.Pie '.ct-chart-three', data, {   labelInterpolationFnc: function value  {     return Math.round value   data.series.reduce sum  * 100  + '%';   } } ;  That's it! The pie chart JavaScript is done. Pretty straightforward if you ask me!  Keep the file open as we'll add a line chart later on in this chapter. At this point,  I'd recommend that you save all your files and compile them. Open up the project  in the browser and make sure that your charts are loading in. If they are, it's great!  However, you'll notice that they don't quite look right. We need to apply some  custom CSS styles.  [ 223 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating a Less component for the charts Just like all of our Bootstrap components, we're going to create a new Less file named  _charts.less and save it to the css components directory. Also, don't forget to  import all of these new Less files into theme.less. Otherwise, the CSS changes won't  be overwritten. Within the new charts less file, insert the following code:     pie charts  .ct-series-a .ct-area,  .ct-series-a .ct-slice-pie {   fill: @blue1; }  .ct-series-b .ct-area,  .ct-series-b .ct-slice-pie {   fill:  @blue1 - 222 ; }  .ct-series-c .ct-area,  .ct-series-c .ct-slice-pie {   fill: @blue2; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the customizing the chart colors:     We're using pie charts with three sections, so note the class naming: ct-  series-a, ct-series-b, and ct-series-c. Each one of these will map to a  piece of pie.     For each different piece of pie, I've assigned a unique color: @blue1 for the   first piece,  @blue1 - 222  for the second piece  this is by using a Less  operator , and @blue2 for the third piece.  That's all you need to change to adjust the look and feel. Compile your code again  and test it in your browser. You can also keep this file open, as we'll be adding  more styles for our line chart later. Before we move on to the widgets section of the  dashboard, we don't want to forget about styling the .charts container that we  previously set up. Open theme.less and scroll down to the Layout section of the  theme. Once you get there, insert the following CSS:  .charts {   text-align: center; }  [ 224 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I want each chart to be centered in its  , so I've set text-align to center for  everything nested under .charts.  That completes the pie chart section of the dashboard. Let's move on to the next  section—widgets.  Setting up the widgets section The widgets section of the dashboard is going to be built using the Bootstrap panels  component. However, before we get that far, let's insert another page header  component for this new section. This will be just like the pie charts section but   with a new title and description:                     Widgets  Important stats about your websites <  h3>              Writing the widgets HTML With that complete, let's move on to the content of this section. The widget row is  going to be divided into four equal columns using the col-lg-3 Bootstrap grid class.  Within each column, we'll insert one panel component, which we'll then customize.  Let's check out the HTML for the entire section:                     Impressions                   2,338                                                Conversion Rate                   2.3%   [ 225 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                                 Mobile Visits                   1,453                                                New Visits                   52.4%                                  Let's breakdown the HTML for the widgets :      I've added a class of .widgets to the .row   so that I can add some  styling later.     You'll notice that I'm using two types of panels here: .panel-success and  .panel-danger. We're going to be creating some simple analytics widgets,  so if a value is up, with positive and down with negative.     Within the body of each panel, we have a value and a Font Awesome up  or down arrow icon, depending on whether the number has increased or  decreased based on the previous day. Of course, this content is fictional,   but it can easily be applied to an actual dashboard.  [ 226 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Reviewing the success panel Let's take a closer look at the success panel HTML and the styles that we need to  customize for this component:       Impressions               2,338                        Let's breakdown the HTML for the panel component:     As you can see, the first   has a class of .panel and .panel-success.   The .panel class is required, and the second class can change depending on  what type you want to use.     Each panel has a .panel-heading  , which is the title for that panel. In   this case, I've named it Impressions.     Each panel also has a .panel-body   for the body of the component.    The first thing that I inserted in the body is an   tag with a value. I used    so that the text would be larger in size. Feel free to use a different tag   if you like.     Next, there is a Font Awesome up arrow icon, since this is a success panel.  Before we can move on to the danger panel, we need to add some custom styles for  the success version. Create a new Less file called _panels.less and save it in the  css components directory. Also, don't forgot to import this file into theme.less.  Insert the following code into the new panel Less file:  .panel {   background: transparent; }  .panel h2 {   margin-top: 0; }  .panel i {   font-size:  @font-size * 4 ; }  [ 227 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's breakdown the CSS for the .panel component:     Let's start with some styles consistent in all panel components. By default,   the background of all panels is white, but I want to remove that. So, I've reset  it to transparent. I removed the top margin for the   in the body of the panel so that the  vertical alignment is equal.         Finally, I set the font-size of the icon to four times the normal size, as I want   the arrows to be quite large.  Now, let's add a few more styles that are specific to the success panel:  .panel-success {   border-color: @green1; }  .panel-success > .panel-heading {   color: @white;   background: @green1;   border-color: @green1; }  .panel-success i {   color: @green1; }  Let's review the CSS for setting up the different panel colors:     The first selector will reset the border of the success panel to use the color   green from our palette     We'll also reset the colors of the panel heading to use our palette's colors    Finally, I'll set the arrow icon color to green to match the rest of the panel  [ 228 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Reviewing the danger panel The danger panel is just like the success one, but it will be red. This panel styling  should be used for an analytical value that has gone down since the last time of  measure. The only change in HTML here will be the .panel-danger class on the  parent  :       Conversion Rate                2.3%                        We will need to add some more custom CSS to our panels component. Go back to  _panels.less and insert the following danger panel styles:  .panel-danger {   border-color: @red1; }  .panel-danger > .panel-heading {   color: @white;   background: @red1;   border-color: @red1; }  .panel-danger i {   color: @red1; }  As with the success panel, these styles will reset the panel to use the red shade from  our color palette. This will also set the down arrow icon that appears in the body of  the component to red.  This completes the widgets section of the dashboard. Next, I'll teach you how to code  the Panels section  not to be confused with the panels component .  [ 229 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Writing the panels HTML The next section of the dashboard will also use the panel component, but we will  extend it further by including a table. Let's first look at the HTML for the first panel.  Then, we'll go over the styles that need customizing. First of all, we'll include a   full-width row with our section header:                     Panels  Detailed information about your website<  small>               This is the same as the previous section headers. Next, we'll divide a row into two  equal columns and insert our first panel with a table inside:       Top Referals                             google.com           1,656                           facebook.com           1,453                           twitter.com           945                           pinterest.com           922                           linkedin.com           844                           buffer.com   [ 230 ]  www.it-ebooks.info            817                           bing.com           767                           yahoo.com           672                           msn.com           454                           cbc.com           231                       Let's breakdown the HTML for the table:         I'm using the .panel-default class again. Inside my panel body, I inserted a   with some classes in it. The  .table-striped will zebra stripe the table, .table-bordered will add  borders, and .table-hover will add a hover state to each row.  Next, let's review the styles that we need to add for this variation of the panel  component.  Customizing the table component Start by creating a new file called _tables.less and save it at css components  directory. Next, open up theme.less and import the table component Less file.   Let's start breaking down the custom table styles:  table, tr, tbody {   border-color: @dark-grey; }  [ 231 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I've reset the table borders to use a color from our palette. Otherwise, they'll be the  default light gray, which we don't want:  .table-bordered > tbody > tr > td,  .table-bordered > tbody > tr > th,  .table-bordered > tfoot > tr > td,  .table-bordered > tfoot > tr > th,  .table-bordered > thead > tr > td,  .table-bordered > thead > tr > th {   border: @border-size @border-type @border-color; }  We also need to customize the border values for the .table-bordered class, which  we added to our   tag. We'll want those values to match the global variables  that we set up previously:  .table-striped > tbody > tr:nth-of-type odd  {   background-color: @dark-grey; }  For the .table-striped class, which adds the zebra striping effect, we need to  change background-color to use the dark gray shade from our color palette.   Again, if you don't change this, it will be a light gray background:  .table-hover > tbody > tr:hover {   background-color: @blue1; }  Finally, we need to set a hover color for the .table-hover class. In this case, I'm  going to use the same blue that I used for the global links. This will give us some  color consistency throughout the dashboard.  Adding the button You'll notice below the panel that I've inserted a button. This could allow the user to  go to an inside page that shows an expanded report. Insert the following button code  after the panel:   Show More   I'm using a basic primary button here. We'll need to update the CSS for the buttons  to match our design.  [ 232 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Customizing the button component Create a new file called _buttons.less and save it at css components directory.  Next, open up theme.less and import the new button component into the master  theme. Insert the following styles into the button style sheet to apply the proper look  and feel:  .btn-primary {   background: @black;   border:  @border-size * 2  @border-type @blue1;   color: @blue1; }  .btn-primary:hover {   background-color: @black;   border:  @border-size * 2  @border-type @blue1;   color: @white; }  Let's breakdown the CSS for the button component:      I've set background-color to black so that it blends with our page  background. You can set it to transparent if you prefer. I've increased the border-width a bit so that it really pops.        The border-color is set to the same blue that we've been using throughout    the dashboard.     On hover, the only thing that will change is the color of the text in the button,   which will go from blue to white. This creates a nice, subtle button effect.  Inserting a line chart We've made it to the last part of the dashboard project. Now we're going to step back  and insert another chart here using the chartist library. However, in this case, we are  going to insert a line chart instead of a pie chart. The first thing that we need to do  is code the HTML for the chart. Next, we'll add some more JavaScript to render the  chart. Finally, we'll need to update some more CSS to control the look and feel of the  lines in our chart.  [ 233 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the HTML for the line chart This final section of the dashboard is made up of three parts. The first is the section  header, the second is the line chart, and the third is a table that will appear below the  line chart. Let's start by first inserting the section header. Insert the following HTML  after the panel tables section that you just completed:                     Table  More detailed information about your website<  small>               This section is the same as that of the previous headers. I'm just changing the name  and description. Let's move on to the next part of this section, which is the line chart  container. Remember that as in our previous charts, we just need to code a container    in which the chart will be loaded via our JavaScript. Insert the following  HTML after the section header code:                      Let's breakdown the HTML for the line chart:         For this chart, I'm using the .ct-chart-table class, which will render    a line chart. I'm also using the .ct-golden-section class, which determines what aspect  ratio should be used for the chart. There are many different options that  you can use here. For more information, check out the documentation at  https:  gionkunz.github.io chartist-js getting-started.html.  Finally, let's insert the HTML for the table that will appear below the line chart. Also  note that there is a button directly below the table in the layout:                     Traffic Sources   [ 234 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                              Organic Search               1,656                                       Referral               1,453                                       Direct               945                                           Show More         As in the previous section, I'm using a panel here with a table nested inside. The only  difference is that this table stretches the width of the layout to fill the entire column.  The Show More button at the bottom is also the same as that in the previous section.  Now that all of the HTML is written, let's move on to coding the JavaScript for the  line chart.  Updating the chart JavaScript For the line chart, we'll need to insert some additional code into the bootboard- charts.js file, which is found in the  js directory. This is the same file that we  created when we made the pie charts earlier in this chapter. Open it again and   insert the following JavaScript code:     table chart new Chartist.Line '.ct-chart-table', {   labels: ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday'],   series: [     [12, 9, 7, 8, 5],     [2, 1, 3.5, 7, 3],     [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]   ] }, {   fullWidth: true,  [ 235 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     chartPadding: {     right: 40   } } ;  Let's breakdown the CSS for the line chart:     The labels array contains the labels that will appear along the x axis of the   chart. They are displayed at the bottom of the chart.     The series array will plot the dots for your line. In this chart, there will be   three lines, so there are three sets of values. Feel free to use more or less. I've included the fullWidth property as I want the chart to span the width   of its container.         Finally, I've added some padding around the chart with the chartPadding   property.  After you've finished customizing these values, save your JavaScript file and  compile. Let's do a compilation here to make sure that everything is working before  we do the CSS updates. Take a look at your page to make sure that a line chart is  being loaded in. It will likely look messed up, but don't worry about that. The last  step will be to customize the CSS and get our chart to look right.  Updating the chart CSS So, the last thing that we need to do for our line chart is update the associated CSS  so that it matches the look and feel of the dashboard. Open _charts.less, which  is located in the css components directory. Let's go step by step through the CSS  changes that are required:  .ct-series-a .ct-line, .ct-series-a .ct-point  {   stroke: @blue1; }  Similar to the pie charts, each section of our line chart will be represented by a  letter—a, b, and c—and we can assign a color to each one of them. The first line in  our chart will be blue. You'll also notice there is a class for the line and the point. The  line should be self-explanatory, but you could break that point class out to be on its  own if you want to give the chart points a color different from that of the line. In this  case, I'm making them the same:  .ct-series-b .ct-line, .ct-series-b .ct-point {  [ 236 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The second line in the chart will use the aqua color from the global color palette. Let's  move on to the third and final line:    stroke: @aqua1; }   .ct-series-c .ct-line, .ct-series-c .ct-point {   stroke: @purple1; }  We'll set the final point to purple from the global color palette. Don't forget that the  second line used -b in the class name and the third used -c. Save the CSS, compile  again, and go back to the dashboard in your browser. Refresh the page, and your line  chart should load in and match the proper color scheme.  That brings the dashboard design and coding to a close! Let's now take a look at the  code for the entire page:                                                    Control Panel              Dashboard               Applications               Documentation               Analytics               Discussion               Users              Account              Profile               Settings               Help               Logout                                                                              [ 237 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                Charts  A quick view of your website stats<  small>                                                                                         Impressions                                                    Clicks                                                    Sales                                                                                  Widgets  Important stats about your websites<  small>                                                                           Impressions                               2,338                                                                                          Conversion Rate                 [ 238 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                  2.3%                                                                                          Mobile Visits                               1,453                                                                                          New Visits                               52.4%                                                                                                                  Panels  Detailed information about your  website                                                                            Top Referals              <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table- hover">                                                      google.com                     1,656                     [ 239 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                        facebook.com                     1,453                                                         twitter.com                     945                                                         pinterest.com                     922                                                         linkedin.com                     844                                                         buffer.com                     817                                                         bing.com                     767                                                         yahoo.com                     672                                                         msn.com                     454                                                         cbc.com                     231                                                                         Show More                                               Popular Pages              <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table- hover">  [ 240 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                                                              1,433                                                          store                     1,211                                                          blog                     1,032                                                          store product                     984                                                          contact                     898                                                          blog post                     872                                                          blog post2                     734                                                          about                     711                                                          blog post3                     454                                                          store product2                     349                                                                         Show More   [ 241 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                                                        Table  More detailed information about your  website                                                                                                                             Traffic Sources              <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table- hover">                                                      Organic Search                     1,656                                                         Referral                     1,453                                                         Direct                     945                                                                         Show More                                 [ 242 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Mobile considerations To optimize the dashboard for mobiles, we need to insert a few mobile-specific   styles into theme.less. Head over to the bottom of the stylesheet and insert the  following code:  @media  max-width: 768px  {   .container {     padding-right: @padding;     padding-left: @padding;   }    .navbar-form {     display: none;   }    ul.nav.navbar-nav.navbar-right {     display: none;   } }  Let's breakdown the mobile specific CSS for the project:          I've added some left and right padding to the overall layout for tablets   and phones I've removed the search field, username, and icon in the navbar for   mobile devices  Summary This brings the sixth chapter to a close. We covered how to code your own  dashboard using Bootstrap. Let's review what you learned, which is as follows— how to code a dashboard using Bootstrap; how to create a project with a dark look  and feel; how to implement and customize the Chartist JavaScript library; how to  customize the Bootstrap panels component, table component, nav component, and  navbar component; and how to use a mobile nav outside of the default navbar.  [ 243 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Bootstrap Social Network  Welcome to the last chapter of this book, where you're going to learn how to build  a social networking site using Bootstrap! This project will include a public profile,  an activity feed, notifications, friends, and private message pages. As part of this  chapter, we'll use much of what you learned in the book to create a complex project  with a minimal look.   [ 245 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before we jump into updating our template, let's take a look at the public profile  page, which will be like this:  [ 246 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Customizing the template Let's start the last blueprint by copying our boilerplate project and creating a new  one called Chapter 7. Open the _data.json file and insert the following code:  {   "index": {     "pageTitle": "Home"   },   "activity-feed": {     "pageTitle": "Activity Feed"   },   "notifications": {     "pageTitle": "Notifications"   },   "messages": {     "pageTitle": "Messages"   },   "friends": {     "pageTitle": "Friends"   } }  For this project, we are going to create five page templates. Let's start by creating the  files in the root of our project. For now, they can just be blank, and we'll start to fill  them in a little later:    index.ejs    activity-feed.ejs    notifications.ejs    messages.ejs    friends.ejs  Updating _layout.ejs Next, let's update the _layout.ejs file in the root of our new project. The layout for  the profile page doesn't have any major differences. Make sure you include the line  of code that will import Roboto as your web font:  <link   href='https:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Roboto:400,700,300'   rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>  [ 247 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This will import three type weights: light  300 , regular  400 , and bold  700 . That's  all we need to do to customize the layout for this project. Here's what the entire file  should look like:                                <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"   href="css bootstrap.min.css">   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="css font-awesome.min. css">   <link   href='https:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Roboto:400,700,300'   rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>        <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements   and media queries -->   <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via   file:   -->         <script   src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com html5shiv 3.7.2 html5shiv.min.js"><  script>     <script   src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com respond 1.4.2 respond.min.js">                                <script   src="  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.11.1 jquery.min.js"><  script>  [ 248 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     <script src="js bootstrap.min.js"   type="text javascript">       Setting up the Less variables The process of setting up your Less variables should feel pretty familiar now. Let's  go ahead and set up the Less variables for the social network. As in the previous  project, we're going to use the colors included with the boilerplate.  Background colors For the background color section, we only need to update the value of the inverse  background variable:  @inverse-background: @navy1;  Text colors The only text color that we are going to change is the heading text variable:  @heading-text: @navy1;  Link colors Let's change both the link color variables to match the color scheme for our   new project:  @primary-link-color: @aqua1; @primary-link-color-hover: @aqua2;  Border colors For the borders, everything will stay the same except for the focus color. This is   the property that controls the border color of an input when it is in focus:  @border-focus: @aqua1;  [ 249 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Typography Earlier, we imported Roboto from Google Web Fonts. Let's now set up our text  variables to use the typeface:  @body-copy: "Roboto", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, verdana,   sans-serif; @heading-copy: "Roboto", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial,   verdana, sans-serif;  Border radius Finally, let's update the border-radius variable to 5px, which will make our buttons  a little rounder:  .round-corners  @radius: 5px  {    new   -moz-border-radius: @radius;   -ms-border-radius: @radius;   border-radius: @radius; }  These are all the updates for the Less variables. Let's take a look at the entire file  before we move on to setting up the header and footer:     color palette  @black: 000; @dark-grey: 333; @grey: ccc; @light-grey: ebebeb; @off-white: f5f5f5; @white: ffffff;  @blue1: 3498db; @blue2: 2980b9; @red1: e74c3c; @red2: c0392b; @yellow1: f1c40f; @yellow2: f39c12; @green1: 2ecc71; @green2: 27ae60; @orange1: e67e22; @orange2: d35400; @aqua1: 1abc9c; @aqua2: 16a085;  [ 250 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   @purple1: 9b59b6; @purple2: 8e44ad; @navy1: 34495e; @navy2: 2c3e50;     background colors @primary-background: @white; @secondary-background: @off-white; @inverse-background: @navy1;     text colors @primary-text: @dark-grey; @light-text: @light-grey; @loud-text: @black; @inverse-text: @white; @heading-text: @navy1;     link colors @primary-link-color: @aqua1; @primary-link-color-hover: @aqua2;     primary border properties @border-color: @light-grey; @border-size: 1px; @border-type: solid; @border-focus: @aqua1;     layout @margin: 1em; @padding: 1em;     MIXINS     round corners or Border radius .round-corners  @radius: 5px  {  [ 251 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     typography @body-copy: "Roboto", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, verdana,  sans-serif; @heading-copy: "Roboto", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, verdana,  sans-serif; @base-font-size: 14px; @font-size: 1em; @base-line-height: 1.5;     -moz-border-radius: @radius;   -ms-border-radius: @radius;   border-radius: @radius; }     animation transitions .transition  @transition: background .1s linear  {   -moz-transition: @transition;   -webkit-transition: @transition;   transition: background @transition; }  Coding the header and footer Let's set up the header and footer for our social networking website. It's going  to be made up of the regular Bootstrap navbar component, with some new  customizations. The main new items will be an icon-based navigation, a search   bar, a utility drop-down menu, and some mobile-specific styling.  Updating the header I'll start out by showing you the code for the entire header, and then we'll dissect   the parts that we need to update. Start off by creating a file called _header.ejs,   and save it in the  partial directory. Then, insert this code:                    <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data- toggle="collapse" data-target="navbar1">          Toggle navigation                                                   Soc<  span>Strap                                   <  a>   [ 252 ]  www.it-ebooks.info               <  a>              <  a>                                                     <input type="text" class="form-control"   placeholder="Search">                                               <a href="" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"  role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Username                                View Profile                 Settings                 Help                 Logout                                              Inserting the brand Head down to the Soc Strap brand line of code as shown in the following code.  You'll notice that part of the brand is wrapped in a   tag. This is for styling  reasons, which I'll cover next:    Soc Strap   Creating the navbar Less file We need to create a new Less file for the navbar component. Open up a new file,  name it _navbar.less, and save it in the css components directory. Insert the  following styles into the file and save it:    navbar .navbar-default {   background-color: @inverse-background;  [ 253 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This first section of styles is actually for the navbar, not the brand. I've set the  background to a different color and removed the bottom border and round corners:    border-color: transparent;    -moz-border-radius: 0;   border-radius: 0; }     brand .navbar-default .navbar-brand {   font-weight: 300;   color: @inverse-text; }  Here's our base brand class. I've set the font weight to light and set the color to use  the inverse variable for the text:  .navbar-default .navbar-brand:focus,  .navbar-default .navbar-brand:hover {   color: @aqua1; }  At the same time, let's set up the hover and focus states for the brand to use our   color palette:  .navbar-brand span {   font-weight: 700;   color: @aqua1; }  Finally, I've set some different styles for the portion of the brand text that appears  in the   tag. This will make the text bold and give it a different color. This is a  easy way of making your brand or logo look a little unique without having to use an  image. Once you've saved the file, don't forget to import it back into theme.less in  the modules section:  @import "components _navbar.less";  Setting up the icon navigation For this project, we're going to use Font Awesome icons for the primary navigation  links. Check out the following HTML for rendering the icons:                       [ 254 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                        The HTML portion here should be easy to understand. However, we need to add  some custom styles for our navbar links as well. Head back to the navbar Less file  and insert the following styles:     navbar links .navbar-default .navbar-nav > li > a {   color: @aqua1; }  .navbar-default .navbar-nav > li > a:focus, .navbar-default .navbar-nav > li > a:hover {   color: @inverse-text; }  These styles will simply customize the icons and all the links in the navbar to use  our color palette.  Adding the search bar For the search bar in the navbar, we're going to insert a form. This is a basic  Bootstrap navbar form, but I'll go over what's happening:                     I've inserted a basic Bootstrap form. Make sure you include the navbar-form class  to get some custom header styling. Also, don't forget the navbar-right class as we  want the form to be aligned right in the header. From there on, it is just your basic  Bootstrap form code, with the exception of a couple of custom styles:     search form .navbar-form .form-control {   border-color: @navy1; }  .form-control:focus {   border-color: @border-focus; }  [ 255 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's take a closer look at what's happening with the search bar:  I've changed the border color of the form input to navy blue        The next class applies the custom border-focus variable that we previously   set up  Adding the utility drop-down menu The last piece of HTML that we need to include is the portion that will include the  utility drop-down menu. Here's what it looks like:            <a href="" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"   role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Username                     View Profile           Settings           Help           Logout                Like the search field, the HTML here is straight out of the Bootstrap box.

Adding some mobile-specific styles The final thing that we need to do before finishing our header is include some  mobile-specific styles. Head back to the navbar Less file and paste the following   code in it:     mobile trigger .navbar-default .navbar-toggle {   border-color: @white; }  .navbar-toggle {   background: @navy2;   border: none;   .round-corners; }  [ 256 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   .navbar-default .navbar-toggle:focus,  .navbar-default .navbar-toggle:hover {   background-color: @aqua1; }  .navbar-default .navbar-toggle .icon-bar {   background-color: @white; }  The preceding styles control the color of the mobile toggle button that will appear on  tablets and phones. I'm simply switched them to match the project's color scheme.  Before we move on to the footer, we need to add some more mobile styles to theme. less. Open up that file and head to the bottom, where the media queries appear.  Then, insert the following:  @media  max-width: 767px  {   .navbar-default .navbar-nav .open .dropdown-menu > li > a {     color: @primary-link-color;   }    .navbar-default .navbar-nav .open .dropdown-menu > li >a:focus,   .navbar-default .navbar-nav .open .dropdown-menu > li >a:hover {     color: @white;   } }  We need to switch some of the utility drop-down menu's colors when it's in the  mobile view. Otherwise, the colors will be lost in the background. That's it for our  header; let's move on to the footer:  Updating the footer The footer for this project is purposely simple. Create a new file called _footer.ejs  and save it in the  partial directory. Then, insert the following code:                                &copy; SocStrap                      [ 257 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As I mentioned, the footer is really simple. We do need to add a few custom styles,  however, to give it a proper look and feel. Insert the following code into theme.less:  .footer {   margin-top:  @padding * 6 ;   padding-bottom:  @padding * 6 ;   padding-top: @padding;   border-top: @border-size @border-color @border-type;   color: @grey; }  Here, I'm giving the footer some margin and padding. I've also added a top border  and set the text to a lighter color. That completes the setup of the header and the  footer. Let's move on to the first template for our project, which will be the public- facing profile page.  Coding the profile page The profile page is the public-facing page of your social network. If someone is  searching for you on the website, this is the page that they will see. In this first  template, we will define a three-column layout that will be used through all the  pages of this project. We'll also set up some new partials for the sidebar elements of  the profile. In this way, we can modularize the design and reuse some of the parts  where it makes sense. Let's start by creating a new file called index.ejs and saving  it to the root of the project. As I mentioned, our project will have a three-column  layout built upon the following grid:          I'm using the container-fluid class here because I want the layout to span  the entire width of the viewport I'm using a three-column grid of 25%, 50%, and 25%                         ..                   ..              [ 258 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         ..              Setting up the left sidebar The left sidebar of our project is going to have a couple of versions. One will be for  public-facing pages such as this profile. The second will be for internal pages, which  only the logged-in user can see. This second version will have some different actions  that make sense for the user. First of all, let's insert the code for the first column into  the profile page:                     To make the code more modular, I've broken the sidebar into a partial. Create a new  file called _sidebar-left-home.ejs and save it in the  partial directory. Let's  open the file and go over the code.  Adding the avatar This first line of the code will render the user's avatar for their profile. Here's   the code:       It's linking to an image that has a class of .main-avatar on it. We need to add some  custom styles for this class:      I've set the width of the image to 100% so that it will stretch the entire width  of the column. It's a good idea to make sure that your image is a little bigger  than you think the maximum size will be so that no pixelation occurrs.     The height property is set to auto so that the image will automatically resize   depending on the width the column.  [ 259 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       I've added a border-radius to the image to give it a more polished look.  img.main-avatar {   width: 100%;   height: auto;    .round-corners; }  Adding the name and description The next block of code will render our user's name and description. Here's the   HTML code:    John Smith    Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et   malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam, feugiat   vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu libero sit   amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae est. Mauris   placerat eleifend leo.          Vancouver, BC         website.com      The first line is our user's name, and there are a couple of styles that we need to add  to theme.less. I'm going to remove line-height and manually set the top and  bottom margins that are exact:  .sidebar-left h2 {   margin-top:  @margin * 1.5 ;   margin-bottom:  @margin * 1.5 ;   line-height: 0; }  .sidebar-left li {   margin-bottom:  @margin - 0.5 ; }  We also need to add a few styles for the unordered list of properties at the bottom of  the description. The following are some simple layout tweaks meant to tighten up  the look and feel:  [ 260 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   .sidebar-left li i {   margin-right: 5px; }  This completes all of the code for the first sidebar partial. Let's take a look at the  entire thing before we move on:        John Smith    Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et   malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam, feugiat   vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu libero sit   amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae est. Mauris   placerat eleifend leo.          Vancouver, BC        <a   href="">website.com      Adding the content column Let's move on to the second column in the layout, which will hold the main content   or feed  for the page. Here's the basic structure of the column:                          ..              Let's take a closer look at what's happening with the structure of the column:     Within the column, there is a   with a wrapping class of content-feed. Inside the content feed will be a series of well. Each post on the feed will be a     new well component.  The following code shows the contents of a single well post in the feed:               [ 261 ]  www.it-ebooks.info          <img src="img avatar1.jpg" width="70" height="70"   class="avatar">                      Mike Michaels          Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus   et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.                               About 3 minutes ago                   Reply                    Like                                  Let's take a closer look at the contents of a single well post in the feed:     Each well is divided into two-column grid    The left column holds the user's avatar image    The right column holds the content of the post    Within the content section, there is some post metadata at the bottom  Each well comes with some custom styling that we need to add. Let's first start with  the global styles that we need to add to theme.less:  .content-feed h3 {   margin-top: 0;   margin-bottom:  @margin - 0.5 ; }  img.avatar {   .round-corners; }  The following margin styles tweak the default Bootstrap margins on an   tag to  make them work with our layout:  [ 262 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Like our main profile avatar, we want each of the post avatars to also have round  corners. However, this image doesn't need to stretch the width of its column, so I've  created a more general .avatar class to apply border-radius:  .feed-meta {   font-size:  @font-size - 0.25 ; }  The preceding style will shrink the font-size of the meta text by 25%:  .feed-meta ul {   margin-bottom: 0; }  Finally, I've removed the bottom margin from the meta unordered list so that I don't  have extra spacing on the inside of the well component. Before we can finish this  column, we need to customize the well component.  Customizing the well component We'll be using the well on multiple pages, so let's create a new Less file named   _well.less and save it in  css components. Once you've completed that, insert   the following code into the Less file:  .well {   background: @secondary-background;   border: none;   padding:  @padding * 2 ;   box-shadow: none;    .round-corners; }  Let's take a closer look at what's happening in the Less file:               I've updated the background color to use our palette I've removed the well's border I added some more padding to the well I've also removed the default box-shadow and added round corners using  the property value of 5px  [ 263 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now this well component can be used across multiple templates. We will come back  a little later and add an alternate styling option for a different well. Once you've  saved the file, don't forget to import it back into theme.less in the modules section:  @import "components _well.less";  Adding the third column The third column of the profile page is similar to the first. It will also use a partial   to make our project more modular. Here's the HTML code:                     I've created another sidebar partial here that we need to fill in. Create a new file  called _sidebar-right.ejs and save it to the  partial directory. Here's the   code for the right sidebar:       Trends            Trend1         Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et   netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.

However, there are some custom styles that we need to apply  to these wells. Open up theme.less and insert the following CSS under the layout  section:  I want to space out each   element within the well consistently, so I've added  the preceding styling to do this:  Since I've added a margin to the wrapping  , I've removed the bottom margin  from any   tags in these wells. This is because I don't want extra spacing there:  .sidebar-right .well div {   margin-bottom: @margin; }  .sidebar-right .well div p {   margin-bottom: 0; }  .sidebar-right h5 {   font-weight: 700;   margin-top: 0;   margin-bottom:  @margin * 1.5 ;   color: @heading-text; }  Finally, I added some custom styling to the   tag that is used for the header in  each well.  [ 265 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Completing the template The rest of the HTML in the template is basic Bootstrap code. Save the index.ejs file  and the first template is complete!

Also make sure you test the first  page in the browser to ensure that it looks good.  Coding the activity feed The next template in the project that we're going to tackle is the activity feed. This is  the page that you would see when you log in to your account. The main differences  compared to the public profile are the form for posting an update and some changes  to the right sidebar.   [ 269 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's see what this page will look like:  [ 270 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Customizing the first column As I mentioned earlier, the first column in this template is going to be different  compared to the public profile. The second left sidebar will be the one used for the  remaining templates as they are all pages that are viewable by the logged-in user  only. Start by creating a new file called _sidebar-left.ejs and save it to the   partial directory. The top of the sidebar, which includes the avatar and description,  will remain the same. Here's the code again, or you can copy it from the first file:        John Smith    Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et   malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam, feugiat   vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu libero sit   amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae est. Mauris   placerat eleifend leo.   The new portion of this file is a set of action buttons. These buttons are designed as a  quick way to get to other pages or sections of the social network. Insert the following  HTML after the avatar and description code:           Friends             Notifications         <i class="fa fa- envelope">  Messages             Edit Profile     This is your standard Bootstrap button code. However, note that I'm using the   .btn-block class on each button as I want them to be treated as block elements   that will span the width of the column.  [ 271 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding button styles Since we're using the Bootstrap button component, we need to create a new Less  component file to style its look and feel. Create a new file called _buttons.less   and save it to the  css components directory. Insert the following code into the   file and save:  .btn-primary {   background-color: @navy1;   border-color: @navy1; }  .btn-primary.active, .btn-primary.focus, .btn-primary:active, .btn-primary:focus,  .btn-primary:hover,  .open > .dropdown-toggle.btn-primary {   background-color: @navy2;   border-color: @navy2; }  I'm only going to customize the .btn-primary button variation. This is because we'll  only be using one button style in the project. All I've done here is changed the colors  to match our palette. Note that I've also included some dropdown classes so that the  navbar dropdown will have the same colors. Once you've saved the file, don't forget  to import it back into theme.less in the modules section:  @import "components _buttons.less";  Adding the post form The second main element of the activity feed is the form for posting an update. This  will be inserted at the top of the center column above the feed of updates. The update  list code is the same as that for the public profile, so feel free to paste that in. Next,  you'll want to insert the following code above the feed entries:                      <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="What's   Up?">              [ 272 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                      Media                    Location                                                  Post Update                                 The entire form is wrapped inside a well component. However, note that there is  also a .alternate class on that   element. What I've done here is created a  variation of the well with a different look and feel for the form. This will require you  to add some more styles to your well component. Open _well.less again and paste  the following code:  First, I've set the alternate well to use the inverse-background color variable, which  happens to be the navy blue color:  .well.alternate {    background: @inverse-background; }  .well.alternate ul.list-inline {   margin-top: 10px;   margin-bottom: 0; }  Next, note the Media and Location links in the form. These are displayed using an  inline list component, and I had to adjust their margins so that they fit perfectly  in the well. These two items also take advantage of using a Font Awesome icon to  improve the design. Finally, we're using our button again and the .pull-right  Bootstrap class to align it on the right within the well.  [ 273 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the new post notification bar The last element that we need to add to this template is the new post notification bar.  This is the aqua colored bar that appears below the form in the layout. The idea here  is similar to Twitter, where you likely have an Ajax call updating you if there are  new posts to view while you are on this page. We're going to implement this using  the Bootstrap alert component. First of all, insert the following HTML code after the  form you just created:          View 10 new   posts     This should be straightforward. We're using the alert-info variation of the  component, which we will style next. Within the alert, there is a link that wraps  another Font Awesome icon and a label indicating how many new posts are available.  Styling the alert bar Create another Less file called _alert.less and save it to  css components.   Next, insert the following code into the file and save it:  .alert {   .round-corners;   padding: @padding; }  Let's take a closer look at what's happening with the alert bar:         I've added our border-radius mixing to normalize the round corners I've also added our padding variable so that it is a consistent value  throughout the project: .alert-info {   background: @aqua1;   text-align: center;   border-color: @aqua1;   color: @white; }  [ 274 ]  www.it-ebooks.info             I reset the background to use the aqua color from our palette I've set the text alignment as center for the entire bar I've also set the border color to the same as the background, as I want them   to be the same     The text color is set to white so that it's easy to read on the aqua background  .alert-info a {   color: @white; }     Any links within the alert bar have also been set to white for consistency  Once you've saved the file, don't forget to import it back into theme.less in the  modules section:  @import "components _alert.less";  All the templates in this project will use the same partial for the third column. Thus,  you're done with the activity feed template. Compile your code and make sure that  you don't have any errors. If all is good, test the page in the browser. Then, let's start  off with the notifications template.

Here, you might see things such as the confirmation of a new  friend following you, someone who has liked one of your posts, or a public reply to  a post from another user. Like the previous template, we are going to use the same  code for the first column. The main changes will be to the second column, where the  content will change to reflect the types of notifications you might receive.   [ 279 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before we start, let's see what this page will look like:  Open the notifications.ejs file and insert the partial for the first column. Here's  the code again, just in case you need it:                       [ 280 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Updating the center column The layout code for this column will not change. However, the content of the column  will be different. The first new part will be the introduction of a page header for this  template. Insert the following code at the top of the column:   Notifications   You'll notice that I'm using the Bootstrap .page-header class here. Before we move  on, let's style this component to match our design. Create a new Less file called   _typography.less and save it to  css components. Then, paste the following code:  .page-header {   margin-top: 0; }  h1 {   font-weight: 300;   color: @heading-text; }  .center {   text-align: center; }  Let's take a closer look at what's happening with the center column:          I've removed the top margin from the page-header class, as I want my title  to align horizontally with the top of the avatar. I customized the   tag to use the lightweight of our font and applied the  heading-text color variable.     Lastly, I added a utility centering class that can be used anywhere in the   project. We're not actually using this in the header, but this is a good time   to add it since we're creating the typography Less file.  Save the Less file, and don't forget to import it to theme.less under the modules  section:  @import "components _typography.less";  [ 281 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding an alert bar As we did with the activity feed, we're going to add a new notification alert bar to  the top of the feed for this page. Insert the following code after the page header:         5 New Notifications    I've swapped in a different Font Awesome icon and label here, but otherwise the  code is the same as that of the previous page.  Adding a notification entry There are multiple types of notifications that you could have on your social  networking website. However, the code for all of them will be the same, with only  the content changing. Let's check out what one of them will look like, in this case,  when a new friend adds you. Insert the following code after the alert bar:                      <img src="img avatar1.jpg" width="70" height="70"   class="avatar">                     Mike Michaels          Added you as a friend.  About 3 minutes   ago                We're using the same two-column grid here as in the other templates. On the avatar    tag, I've applied the .avatar class to give the image round corners. Make sure  that you add these styles to theme.less so that the styles are applied:  img.avatar {   .round-corners; }  [ 282 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The rest of the CSS for this section has been set up in previous templates, so this is  just an exercise of changing the content to be notification-specific. Let's take a look   at the entire page code before we move on to the private messages section:                                                                                 Notifications                         5 New Notifications                                                                       <img src="img avatar1.jpg" width="70" height="70"   class="avatar">                                             Mike Michaels                  Added you as a friend.

This is  where you would come to send a direct message to one of your friends on the social  network—a message that you want to keep private and hidden from other users. The  left and right sidebars will remain the same; only the content of the center column  will change.   [ 285 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before we start, let's see what this page will look like:  [ 286 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Open the messages.ejs file and paste the page-header code at the top of   the column:      Messages          New Message         Note that in this header, I've added a   tag that is right aligned with a button  inside of it. This is the button that a user would click on to start a new message. The  span needs to be nested inside the   tag as it's a block element, but we don't want  to break the button onto a new line.  Adding a conversation In previous templates, we were happy to have a single entry in a single well  component. For a conversation, however, there may be multiple entries and  we would want to group them all into one well so that the user can see where  conversations start and end. To do this, I've decided to use the Bootstrap media  component. This is a flexible component that can be used to display different types   of content, such as feeds, conversations, and card-type layouts. Let's start by looking  at the code for a single conversation:                                            Mike Michaels          Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus   et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam,   feugiat vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu   libero sit amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae   est. Mauris placerat eleifend leo.                                   [ 287 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                       John Smith          Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus   et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam,   feugiat vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu   libero sit amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae   est. Mauris placerat eleifend leo.                       Reply                Delete                       Let's take a closer look at what's happening with the single conversation:     Note that there is a well component that wraps the entire conversation.    Each entry or response in the conversation is wrapped into a media   component. In the case of this component, you don't need to use the standard  Bootstrap grid classes; you can simply use the predefined class names.     At the bottom of the well are some action buttons. They are wrapped in a     tag with the pull-right class in order to right-align them. I'm using the primary button style for the Reply button and the danger  button style as a "delete this conversation" button.         Each button makes use of a Font Awesome icon to better indicate its    assigned action.  That completes the design of the private messages section. Let's look at all of the  HTML before moving on to the final friends template:                                                           [ 288 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                                     Messages                          New Message                                                                                    <img src="img avatar1.jpg" class="media-object   avatar">                                             Mike   Michaels                  Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et   netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.

We'll only need to edit the middle column, so open up friends.ejs and insert this  page-header code at the top of the column:      Friends     134 Friends      I'm using the same pattern here as that of the other page headers. But within the    tag on this   tag, we are going to use the   tag to indicate the  number of friends the user has. A   tag with a header tag in Bootstrap  provides some built-in styles you can take advantage of.  Adding a friend entry As in the previous templates, let's dissect a single friend entry and figure out how   it's built. Insert the following code below the page-header in the center column:                      <img src="img avatar1.jpg" width="70" height="70"   class="avatar">                              Mike Michaels                       <i class="fa fa- trash">                           Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et   malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam, feugiat   vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu libero sit   amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae est. Mauris   placerat eleifend leo.              [ 293 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's take a closer look at how a friend entry is built:     We're back to using our regular Bootstrap grid column classes again.    No need to use the media component here!     The entire entry is wrapped in a well component.    At the top of the right-hand-side column, I've inserted a   with the   pull-right class again. This time, it includes a button with a Font Awesome  trash icon. The idea here is that clicking on this button would delete the  friend from your list.     The remaining content in the right-hand-side column is the friend's name,  with a link to their profile and the description that appears on their profile.  This template should be really easy to understand and code. Before we finish this,  let's take a look at the code for the entire page:                                                                                            Friends             134   Friends                                                                         <img src="img avatar1.jpg" width="70" height="70"   class="avatar">                                                              Mike Michaels                     [ 294 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                      <i   class="fa fa-trash">                                                   Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et   netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.
