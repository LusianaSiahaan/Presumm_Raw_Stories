If you are looking for a  resource to learn about deep learning from scratch and to quickly become able to use this  knowledge to solve real-world problems, you have found the right book. Deep Learning  with R is meant for statisticians, analysts, engineers and students with a reasonable amount  of R experience, but no significant knowledge of machine learning and deep learning. This  book is an adaptation of my previously published Deep Learning with Python, with all of  the  code  examples  using  the  R  interface  to Keras.  The  goal  of  the  book  is  to  provide  a  learning resource for the R community that goes all the way from basic theory to advanced  practical applications.    Deep  learning  is  an  immensely  rich  subfield  of  machine  learning,  with  powerful  applications ranging from machine perception to natural language processing, all the way up  to  creative  AI.  Yet,  its  core  concepts  are  in  fact  very  simple.  Deep  learning  is  often  presented as shrouded in a certain mystique, with references to algorithms that “work like  the  brain”,  that  “think”  or  “understand”.  Reality  is  however  quite  far  from  this  science- fiction dream, and I will do my best in these pages to dispel these illusions. I believe that  there  are  no  difficult  ideas  in  deep  learning,  and  that’s  why  I  started  this  book,  based  on  premise that all of the important concepts and applications in this field could be taught to  anyone, with very few prerequisites.   This book is structured around a series of practical code examples, demonstrating on real- world  problems  every  the  notions  that  gets  introduced.  I  strongly  believe  in  the  value  of  teaching  using  concrete  examples,  anchoring  theoretical  ideas  into  actual  results  and  tangible code patterns. These examples all rely on Keras, the deep learning library. When I  released the initial version of Keras almost two years ago, little did I know that it would  quickly skyrocket to become one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks. A big  part  of  that  success  is  that  Keras  has  always  put  ease  of  use  and  accessibility  front  and  center.  This  same  reason  is  what  makes  Keras  a  great  library  to  get  started  with  deep  learning, and thus a great fit for this book. By the time you reach the end of this book, you  will have become a Keras expert.   I  hope  that  you  will  this  book  valuable  —deep  learning  will  definitely  open  up  new  intellectual  perspectives  for  you,  and  in  fact  it  even  has  the  potential  to  transform  your  career, being the most in-demand scientific specialization these days. I am looking forward  to your reviews and comments. Your feedback is essential in order to write the best possible  book, that will benefit the greatest number of people.     — François Chollet      Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r          brief contents   PART 1:  INTRODUCTION TO DEEP LEARNING     1  What is deep learning?    2  Before we begin: the mathematical blocks of neural networks    3  Getting started with neural networks    4  Fundamentals of machine learning  PART 2:  DEEP LEARNING IN PRACTICE     5  Deep learning for computer vision    6  Deep learning for text and sequences    7  Advanced deep learning best practices    8  Generative deep learning    9  Conclusions   APPENDIXES:    A  Installing Keras and its dependencies on Ubuntu   B  Running RStudio Server on a EC2 GPU instance   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r   What is deep learning?  1  This chapter covers  High-level definitions of fundamental concepts Timeline of the development of machine learning Key factors behind deep learning’s rising popularity and future potential  In the past few years, artificial intelligence  AI  has been a subject of intense media hype. Machine learning, deep learning, and AI come up in countless articles, often outside of technology-minded publications. We’re being promised a future of intelligent chatbots, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants—a future sometimes painted in a grim light and other times as an utopia, where human jobs would be scarce and most economic activity would be handled by robots or AI agents. This chapter provides essential context around artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.  1.1 Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning  As  a  future  or  current  practitioner  of  machine  learning,  it’s  important  to  be  able  to recognize the signal in the noise so that you can tell world-changing developments from mere overhyped press releases. Our future is at stake, and it’s a future in which you have an active role to play: after reading this book, you’ll be one of those who develop the AIs.  So  let’s  tackle  these  questions:  What  has  deep  learning  achieved  so  far?  How significant is it? Where are we headed next? Should you believe the hype?  First, we need to define clearly what we’re talking about when we mention   . What are artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning  see figure 1.1 ? How do they relate to each other?  AI  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  1   Figure 1.1 Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning  1.1.1 Artificial intelligence  Artificial intelligence was born in the 1950s, when a handful of pioneers from the nascent field of computer science started asking whether computers could be made to "think"—a question whose ramifications we’re still exploring today. A concise definition of the field would  be  as  follows:  the  effort  to  automate  intellectual  tasks  normally  performed  by humans .  As  such,  AI  is  a  general  field  that  encompasses  machine  learning  and  deep learning, but that also includes many more approaches that don’t involve any learning. Early  chess  programs,  for  instance,  only  involved  hard-coded  rules  crafted  by programmers,  and  didn’t  qualify  as  machine  learning.  For  a  fairly  long  time,  many experts  believed  that  human-level  artificial  intelligence  could  be  achieved  by  having programmers  handcraft  a  sufficiently  large  set  of  explicit  rules  for  manipulating knowledge. This approach is known as  , and it was the dominant paradigm in AI  from  the  1950s  to  the  late  1980s.  It  reached  its  peak  popularity  during  the  expert systems   boom of the 1980s.  symbolic AI  Although symbolic AI proved suitable to solve well-defined, logical problems, such as playing chess, it turned out to be intractable to figure out explicit rules for solving more  complex,  fuzzy  problems,  such  as  image  classification,  speech  recognition,  and language  translation.  A  new  approach  arose  to  take  symbolic  AI’s  place:  machine learning  .  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  2   1.1.2 Machine Learning  Analytical  Engine  In  Victorian  England,  Lady  Ada  Lovelace  was  a  friend  and  collaborator  of  Charles Babbage,  the  inventor  of  the  :  the  first  known  general-purpose, mechanical  computer.  Although  visionary  and  far  ahead  of  its  time,  the  Analytical Engine wasn’t meant as a general-purpose computer when it was designed in the 1830s and 1840s, because the concept of general-purpose computation was yet to be invented. It was  merely  meant  as  a  way  to  use  mechanical  operations  to  automate  certain computations  from  the  field  of  mathematical  analysis—hence  the  name  Analytical Engine. In 1843, Ada Lovelace remarked on the invention, "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it  to  perform.…  Its  province  is  to  assist  us  in  making  available  what  we’re  already acquainted with."  This  remark  was  later  quoted  by  AI  pioneer  Alan  Turing  as  "Lady  Lovelace’s objection" in his landmark 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence,"  which introduced the   as well as key concepts that would come to shape AI. Turing was quoting Ada Lovelace while pondering whether general-purpose computers could be capable of learning and originality, and he came to the conclusion that they could.  Turing test  1  Footnote 1mA. M. Turing, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence,"   Mind   59, no. 236  1950 : 433-460.  Machine learning arises from this question: could a computer go beyond "what we know how to order it to perform" and learn on its own how to perform a specified task? Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data?  This  question  opens  the  door  to  a  new  programming  paradigm.  In  classical programming, the paradigm of symbolic AI, humans input rules  a program  and data to be  processed  according  to  these  rules,  and  out  come  answers   see  figure  1.2 .  With machine learning, humans input data as well as the answers expected from the data, and out  come  the  rules.  These  rules  can  then  be  applied  to  new  data  to  produce  original answers.  Figure 1.2 Machine learning: a new programming paradigm  A  machine-learning  system  is     rather  than  explicitly  programmed.  It’s presented with many examples relevant to a task, and it finds statistical structure in these examples that eventually allows the system to come up with rules for automating the task. For instance, if you wished to automate the task of tagging your vacation pictures,  trained  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  3   you could present a machine-learning system with many examples of pictures already tagged by humans, and the system would learn statistical rules for associating specific pictures to specific tags.  Although  machine  learning  only  started  to  flourish  in  the  1990s,  it  has  quickly become  the  most  popular  and  most  successful  subfield  of  AI,  a  trend  driven  by  the availability of faster hardware and larger datasets. Machine learning is tightly related to mathematical statistics, but it differs from statistics in several important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to deal with large, complex datasets  such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels  for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would be impractical. As a result, machine learning,  and  especially  deep  learning,  exhibits  comparatively  little  mathematical theory—maybe  too  little—and  is  engineering  oriented.  It’s  a  hands-on  discipline  in which ideas are proven empirically much more often than theoretically.  1.1.3 Learning representations from data  deep learning  To define   and understand the difference between deep learning and other machine-learning  approaches,  first  we  need  some  idea  of  what  machine-learning algorithms  .  We  just  stated  that  machine  learning  discovers  rules  to  execute  a data-processing task, given examples of what’s expected. So, to do machine learning, we need three things:  do  Input data points—For instance, if the task is speech recognition, these data points could be sound files of people speaking. If the task is image tagging, they could be picture files. Examples of the expected output—In a speech-recognition task, these could be human-generated transcripts of sound files. In an image task, expected outputs could tags such as "dog", "cat", and so on. A way to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job—This is necessary in order to determine the distance between the algorithm’s current output and its expected output. The measurement is used as a feedback signal to adjust the way the algorithm works. This adjustment step is what we call   learning  .  representations  A machine-learning model transforms its input data into meaningful output, a process that is "learned" from exposure to known examples of inputs and outputs. Therefore, the meaningfully transform data central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to  :  of the input data at hand—representations in other words, to learn useful  that  get  us  closer  to  the  expected  output.  Before  we  go  any  further:  what’s  a encode representation? At its core, it’s a different way to look at data—to  data. For instance, a color image can be encoded in the RGB format  red-green-blue  or in the HSV format  hue-saturation-value : these are two different representations of the same data. Some tasks that may be difficult with one representation can become easy with another. For example, the task "select all red pixels in the image" is simpler in the RBG format, whereas "make the image less saturated" is simpler in the HSV format. Machine-learning models are all about finding appropriate representations for their input data—transformations of the data that make it more amenable to the task at hand, such as a classification task.  represent   or   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  4   Let’s make this concrete. Consider an x axis, a y axis, and some points represented by  their coordinates in the  x, y  system, as shown in figure 1.3.  Figure 1.3 Some sample data  As you can see, we have a few white points and a few black points. Let’s say we want to develop an algorithm that can take the coordinates  x, y  of a point and output whether that point is likely to be black or to be white. In this case,  The inputs are the coordinates of our points. The expected outputs are the colors of our points. A way to measure whether our algorithm is doing a good job could be, for instance, the percentage of points that are being correctly classified.  What we need here is a new representation of our data that cleanly separates the white points  from  the  black  points.  One  transformation  we  could  use,  among  many  other possibilities, would be a coordinate change, illustrated in figure 1.4.  Figure 1.4 Coordinate change  In this new coordinate system, the coordinates of our points can be said to be a new representation of our data. And it’s a good one! With this representation, the black white classification problem can be expressed as a simple rule: black points are such that x 0 or "white  points  are  such  that  x  <  0".  This  new  representation  basically  solves  the classification problem.  In  this  case,  we  defined  the  coordinate  change  by  hand.  But  if  instead  we  tried systematically searching for different possible coordinate changes, and used as feedback  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  5   deep learning   special.  1.1.4 The "deep" in deep learning  the  percentage  of  points  being  correctly  classified,  then  we  would  be  doing  machine learning.  ,  in  the  context  of  machine  learning,  describes  an  automatic  search process for better representations.  Learning  All  machine-learning  algorithms  consist  of  automatically   finding  such transformations that turn data into more useful representations for a given task. These operations can be coordinate changes, as you just saw, or linear projections  which may destroy information , translations, nonlinear operations  such as select all points such that x  0 ,  and  so  on.  Machine-learning  algorithms  aren’t  usually  creative  in  finding  these transformations; they’re merely searching through a predefined set of operations, called a hypothesis space  .  So that’s what machine learning is, technically: searching for useful representations of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from some feedback  signal.  This  simple  idea  allows  for  solving  a  remarkably  broad  range  of intellectual tasks, from speech recognition to autonomous car driving.  Now that you understand what we mean by   learning  , let’s take a look at what makes    in   deep  layers  deep learning  Deep  learning  is  a  specific  subfield  of  machine  learning:  a  new  take  on  learning representations  from  data  that  puts  an  emphasis  on  learning  successive    of increasingly meaningful representations. The   isn’t a reference to any kind of deeper understanding achieved by the approach; rather, it stands for this idea of successive layers of representations. How many layers contribute to a model of the data is called the   of the model. Other appropriate names for the field could have been  . Modern deep  learning  often  involves  tens  or  even  hundreds  of  successive  layers  of representation—and  they’re  all  learned  automatically  from  exposure  to  training  data. Meanwhile, other approaches to machine learning tend to focus on learning only one or two layers of representation of the data; hence they’re sometimes called shallow learning .  hierarchical representations learning  layered representations learning  depth   and   neural networks  In deep learning, these layered representations are  almost always  learned via models , structured in literal layers stacked one after the other. The term  called  neural network  is a reference to neurobiology, but although some of the central concepts in deep learning were developed in part by drawing inspiration from our understanding of the brain, deep learning models are   models of the brain. There’s no evidence that the brain implements anything like the learning mechanisms used in modern deep-learning models. You may come across pop-science articles proclaiming that deep learning works like  the  brain  or  was  modeled  after  the  brain,  but  that  isn’t  the  case.  It  would  be confusing and counterproductive for newcomers to the field to think of deep learning as being in any way related to the neurobiology; you don’t need that shroud of "just like our  not  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  6   minds" mystique and mystery, and you may as well forget anything you may have read about  hypothetical  links  between  deep  learning  and  biology.  For  our  purposes,  deep learning is a mathematical framework for learning representations from data.  What do the representations learned by a deep-learning algorithm look like? Let’s examine how a network several layers deep  see figure 1.5  transforms an image of a digit in order to recognize what digit it is.  Figure 1.5 A deep neural network for digit classification  As  you  can  see  in  figure  1.6,  the  network  transforms  the  digit  image  into representations that are increasingly different from the original image and increasingly informative  about  the  final  result.  You  can  think  of  a  deep  network  as  a  multistage information-distillation operation, where information goes through successive filters and comes out increasingly     that is, useful with regard to some task .  purified  Figure 1.6 Deep representations learned by a digit-classification model  So  that’s  what  deep  learning  is,  technically:  a  multistage  way  to  learn  data  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  7   representations.  It’s  a  simple  idea—but,  as  it  turns  out,  very  simple  mechanisms, sufficiently scaled, can end up looking like magic.  1.1.5 Understanding how deep learning works, in three figures  At this point, you know that machine learning is about mapping inputs  such as images  to targets  such as the label "cat" , which is done by observing many examples of input and targets. You also know that deep neural networks do this input-to-target mapping via a  deep  sequence  of  simple  data  transformations   layers   and  that  these  data transformations are learned by exposure to examples. Now let’s look at how this learning happens, concretely.  The specification of what a layer does to its input data is stored in the layer’s   weights , which  in  essence  are  a  bunch  of  numbers.  In  technical  terms,  we’d  say  that  the  by its weights  see figure 1.7 . transformation implemented by a layer is  learning  Weights are also sometimes called the  means finding a set of values for the weights of all layers in a network, such that the network  will  correctly  map  example  inputs  to  their  associated  targets.  But  here’s  the thing:  a  deep  neural  network  can  contain  tens  of  millions  of  parameters.  Finding  the correct  value  for  all  of  them  may  seem  like  a  daunting  task,  especially  given  that modifying the value of one parameter will affect the behavior of all others!   of a layer.  In this context,   parametrized  parameters  Figure 1.7 A neural network is parametrized by its weights.  To control something, first you need to be able to observe it. To control the output of a neural network, you need to be able to measure how far this output is from what you objective expected. This is the job of the  function . The loss function takes the predictions of the network and the true target  what you wanted the network to output  and computes a distance score, capturing how well the network has done on this specific example  see figure 1.8 .   of the network, also called the   loss function  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  8   Figure 1.8 A loss function measures the quality of the network’s output.  The fundamental trick in deep learning is to use this score as a feedback signal to adjust the value of the weights a little, in a direction that will lower the loss score for the current  example   see  figure  1.9 .  This  adjustment  is  the  job  of  the  ,  which  algorithm: the central algorithm in deep implements what’s called the  learning. The next chapter will explain in more detail how backpropagation works.  backpropagation  optimizer  Figure 1.9 The loss score is used as a feedback signal to adjust the weights.  Initially,  the  weights  of  the  network  are  assigned  random  values,  so  the  network merely implements a series of random transformations. Naturally, its output is far from what it should ideally be, and the loss score is accordingly very high. But with every example the network processes, the weights are adjusted a little in the correct direction, and  the  loss  score  decreases.  This  is  the  ,  which,  repeated  a  sufficient number of times  typically tens of iterations over thousands of examples , yields weight values that minimize the loss function. A network with a minimal loss is one for which the outputs are as close as they can be to the targets: a trained network. Once again, a simple mechanism that, once scaled, ends up looking like magic.  training  loop  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  9   1.1.6 What deep learning has achieved so far  Although  deep  learning  is  a  fairly  old  subfield  of  machine  learning,  it  only  rose  to prominence in the early 2010s. In the few years since, it has achieved nothing short of a revolution in the field, with remarkable results on perceptual problems such as seeing and hearing—problems involving skills that seem natural and intuitive to humans but have long been elusive for machines.  In  particular,  deep  learning  has  achieved  the  following  breakthroughs,  all  in  historically difficult areas of machine learning:  Near-human-level image classification Near-human-level speech recognition Near-human-level handwriting transcription Improved machine translation Improved text-to-speech conversion Digital assistants such as Google Now and Amazon Alexa Near-human-level autonomous driving Improved ad targeting, as used by Google, Baidu, and Bing Improved search results on the Web Ability to answer natural-language questions Superhuman Go playing  We’re  still  exploring  the  full  extent  of  what  deep  learning  can  do.  We’ve  started applying  it  to  a  wide  variety  of  problems  outside  of  machine  perception  and natural-language understanding, such as formal reasoning. If successful, this may herald an age where deep learning assists humans in doing science, developing software, and more.  1.1.7 Don’t believe the short-term hype  Although deep learning has led to remarkable achievements in recent years, expectations for what the field will be able to achieve in the next decade tend to run much higher than what  will  turn  out  to  be  possible.  Although  some  world-changing  applications  like autonomous cars are already within reach, many more are likely to remain elusive for a long time, such as believable dialogue systems, human-level machine translation across arbitrary languages, and human-level natural-language understanding. In particular, talk of   shouldn’t be taken too seriously. The risk with high expectations for the short term is that, as technology fails to deliver, research investment will dry up, slowing progress for a long time.  human-level general intelligence  This  has  happened  before.  Twice  in  the  past,  AI  went  through  a  cycle  of  intense optimism  followed  by  disappointment  and  skepticism,  with  a  dearth  of  funding  as  a result. It started with symbolic AI in the 1960s. In those early days, projections about AI were flying high. One of the best-known pioneers and proponents of the symbolic AI approach  was  Marvin  Minsky,  who  claimed  in  1967,  "Within  a  generation  …  the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved." Three years later, in 1970, he made a more precisely quantified prediction: "In from three to eight years we  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  10   1.1.8 The promise of AI  will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being." In 2016, such an achievement still appears to be far in the future—so far that we have no way to predict how long it will take—but in the 1960s and early 1970s, several experts believed it to be right around the corner  as do many people today . A few years later, as these high expectations failed to materialize, researchers and government funds turned away from the field, marking the start of the first    a reference to a nuclear winter, because this was shortly after the height of the Cold War .  AI winter  It wouldn’t be the last one. In the 1980s, a new take on symbolic AI,   expert systems , started gathering steam among large companies. A few initial success stories triggered a wave of investment, with corporations around the world starting their own in-house AI departments to develop expert systems. Around 1985, companies were spending over $1 billion each year on the technology; but by the early 1990s, these systems had proven expensive to maintain, difficult to scale, and limited in scope, and interest died down. Thus began the second AI winter.  We may be currently witnessing the third cycle of AI hype and disappointment—and we’re still in the phase of intense optimism. It’s best to moderate our expectations for the short term and make sure people less familiar with the technical side of the field have a clear idea of what deep learning can and can’t deliver.  Although we may have unrealistic short-term expectations for AI, the long-term picture is  looking  bright.  We’re  only  just  getting  started  in  applying  deep  learning  to  many important problems for which it could prove transformative, from medical diagnoses to digital assistants. AI research has been moving forward amazingly quickly in the past five years, in large part due to a level of funding never seen before in the short history of AI, but so far relatively little of this progress has made its way into the products and processes that form our world. Most of the research findings of deep learning aren’t yet applied, or at least not applied to the full range of problems they can solve across all industries.  Your  doctor  doesn’t  yet  use  AI,  and  neither  does  your  accountant.  You probably don’t use AI technologies in your day-to-day life. Of course, you can ask your smartphone  simple  questions  and  get  reasonable  answers,  you  can  get  fairly  useful product recommendations on Amazon.com, and you can search for "birthday" on Google Photos  and  instantly  find  those  pictures  of  your  daughter’s  birthday  party  from  last month. That’s a far cry from where such technologies used to stand. But such tools are still only accessory to our daily lives. AI has yet to transition to being central to the way we work, think, and live.  Right now, it may seem hard to believe that AI could have a large impact on our world, because it isn’t yet widely deployed—much as, back in 1995, it would have been difficult to believe in the future impact of the internet. Back then, most people didn’t see how the internet was relevant to them and how it was going to change their lives. The same is true for deep learning and AI today. But make no mistake: AI is coming. In a not-so-distant  future,  AI  will  be  your  assistant,  even  your  friend;  it  will  answer  your  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  11   questions,  help  educate  your  kids,  and  watch  over  your  health.  It  will  deliver  your groceries to your door and drive you from point A to point B. It will be your interface to an increasingly complex and increasingly information-intensive world. And, even more important, AI will help humanity as a whole move forward, by assisting human scientists in  new  breakthrough  discoveries  across  all  scientific  fields,  from  genomics  to mathematics.  On the way, we may face a few setbacks and maybe a new AI winter—in much the same way the internet industry was overhyped in 1998–1999 and suffered from a crash that dried up investment throughout the early 2000s. But we’ll get there eventually. AI will end up being applied to nearly every process that makes up our society and our daily lives, much like the internet today.  Don’t believe the short-term hype, but do believe in the long-term vision. It may take a while for AI to be deployed to its true potential—a potential the full extent of which no one  has  yet  dared  to  dream—but  AI  is  coming,  and  it  will  transform  our  world  in  a fantastic way.  1.2 Before deep learning: a brief history of machine learning  Deep learning has reached a level of public attention and industry investment never seen before in the history of AI, but it isn’t the first successful form of machine learning. It’s safe to say that most of the machine-learning algorithms used in the industry today aren’t deep-learning  algorithms.  Deep  learning  isn’t  always  the  right  tool  for  the job—sometimes  there  isn’t  enough  data  for  deep  learning  to  be  applicable,  and sometimes the problem is better solved by a different algorithm. If deep learning is your first contact with machine learning, then you may find yourself in a situation where all you  have  is  the  deep-learning  hammer,  and  every  machine-learning  problem  starts  to look  like  a  nail.  The  only  way  not  to  fall  into  this  trap  is  to  be  familiar  with  other approaches and practice them when appropriate.  A detailed discussion of classical machine-learning approaches is outside of the scope of this book, but we’ll briefly go over them and describe the historical context in which they were developed. This will allow us to place deep learning in the broader context of machine  learning  and  better  understand  where  deep  learning  comes  from  and  why  it matters.  1.2.1 Probabilistic modeling  Probabilistic modeling is the application of the principles of statistics to data analysis. It was one of the earliest forms of machine learning, and it’s still widely used to this day. One of the best-known algorithms in this category is the Naive Bayes algorithm.  Naive Bayes is a type of machine-learning classifier based on applying the Bayes theorem while assuming that the features in the input data are all independent  a strong, or "naive" assumption, which is where the name comes from . This form of data analysis predates  computers  and  was  applied  by  hand  decades  before  its  first  computer  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  12   1.2.2 Early neural networks  implementation   most  likely  dating  back  to  the  1950s .  The  Bayes  theorem  and  the foundations of statistics date back to the 18th century, and these are all you need to start using Naive Bayes classifiers.  logistic  regression  A  closely  related  model  is  the      logreg  for  short ,  which  is sometimes  considered  to  be  the  "hello  world"  of  modern  machine  learning.  Don’t  be misled  by  its  name—logreg  is  a  classification  algorithm  rather  than  a  regression algorithm. Much like Naive Bayes, logreg predates computing by a long time, yet it’s still useful to this day, thanks to its simple and versatile nature. It’s often the first thing a data scientist will try on a dataset to get a feel for the classification task at hand.  Early  iterations  of  neural  networks  have  been  completely  supplanted  by  the  modern variants  covered  in  these  pages,  but  it’s  helpful  to  be  aware  of  how  deep  learning originated. Although the core ideas of neural networks were investigated in toy forms as early as the 1950s, the approach took decades to get started. For a long time, the missing piece was an efficient way to train large neural networks. This changed in the mid 1980s, when  multiple  people  independently  rediscovered  the    algorithm—a way to train chains of parametric operations using gradient-descent optimization  later in the  book,  we’ll  precisely  define  these  concepts --and  started  applying  it  to  neural networks.  backpropagation  The first successful practical application of neural nets came in 1989 from Bell Labs, when  Yann  LeCun  combined  the  earlier  ideas  of  convolutional  neural  networks  and backpropagation, and applied them to the problem of classifying handwritten digits. The resulting network, dubbed  , was used by the United States Postal Service in the 1990s to automate the reading of ZIP codes on mail envelopes.  LeNet  As neural networks started to gain some respect among researchers in the 1990s, thanks to this first success, a new approach to machine learning rose to fame and quickly sent neural nets back to oblivion: kernel methods.   are a group of classification algorithms, the best known of which is the    SVM . The modern formulation of an SVM was developed by Vladimir Vapnik and Corinna Cortes in the early 1990s at Bell Labs and published in 1995,  although an older linear formulation was published by Vapnik and Chervonenkis as early as 1963.3 Footnote 2mVladimir Vapnik and Corinna Cortes, "Support-Vector Networks,"  3  1995 : 273–297.  Kernel methods support vector machine  Machine Learning   20, no.  2  Footnote 3mVladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis, "A Note on One Class of Perceptrons,"  Automation and Remote Control   25  1964 .  SVMs aim at solving classification problems by finding good  decision boundaries  see  figure  1.10   between  two  sets  of  points  belonging  to  two  different  categories.  A  1.2.3 Kernel methods  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  13   decision boundary can be thought of as a line or surface separating your training data into two spaces corresponding to two categories. To classify new data points, you just need to check which side of the decision boundary they fall on.  Figure 1.10 A decision boundary  SVMs proceed to find these boundaries in two steps:  1.  2.  The data is mapped to a new high-dimensional representation where the decision boundary can be expressed as a hyperplane  if the data was two-dimensional, as in figure 1.10, a hyperplane would be a straight line . A good decision boundary  a separation hyperplane  is computed by trying to maximize the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class, a step called samples outside of the training dataset.  . This allows the boundary to generalize well to new  maximizing the margin  kernel trick  The  technique  of  mapping  data  to  a  high-dimensional  representation  where  a classification problem becomes simpler may look good on paper, but in practice it’s often computationally intractable. That’s where the   comes in  the key idea that kernel methods are named after . Here’s the gist of it: to find good decision hyperplanes in the new representation space, you don’t have to explicitly compute the coordinates of your points in the new space; you just need to compute the distance between pairs of points  in  that  space,  which  can  be  done  efficiently  using  a  .  A  kernel function is a computationally tractable operation that maps any two points in your initial space to the distance between these points in your target representation space, completely bypassing  the  explicit  computation  of  the  new  representation.  Kernel  functions  are typically crafted by hand rather than learned from data—in the case of an SVM, only the separation hyperplane is learned.  kernel  function  At  the  time  they  were  developed,  SVMs  exhibited  state-of-the-art  performance  on simple  classification  problems  and  were  one  of  the  few  machine-learning  methods backed by extensive theory and amenable to serious mathematical analysis, making them well  understood  and  easily  interpretable.  Because  of  these  useful  properties,  SVMs became extremely popular in the field for a long time.  But SVMs proved hard to scale to large datasets and didn’t provide good results for  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  14   perceptual problems such as image classification. Because an SVM is a shallow method, applying an SVM to perceptual problems requires first extracting useful representations manually  a step called    , which is difficult and brittle.  feature engineering  1.2.4 Decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines  Decision  trees  are  flowchart-like  structures  that  let  you  classify  input  data  points  or predict  output  values  given  inputs   see  figure  1.11 .  They’re  easy  to  visualize  and interpret. Decisions trees learned from data began to receive significant research interest in the 2000s, and by 2010 they were often preferred to kernel methods.  Figure 1.11 A decision tree: the parameters that are learned are the questions about the data. A question could be, for instance, "Is coefficient 2 in the data higher than 3.5?"  kaggle.com  Random  Forest  In  particular,  the     algorithm  introduced  a  robust,  practical  take  on decision-tree learning that involves building a large number of specialized decision trees and  then  ensembling  their  outputs.  Random  forests  are  applicable  to  a  wide  range  of problems—you could say that they’re almost always the second-best algorithm for any shallow machine-learning task. When the popular machine-learning competition website   got started in 2010, random forests quickly became a favorite on Kaggle   the  platform—until  2014,  when    took  over.  A  gradient boosting machine, much like a random forest, is a machine-learning technique based on ensembling weak prediction models, generally decision trees. It uses  , a way  to  improve  any  machine-learning  model  by  iteratively  training  new  models  that specialize  in  addressing  the  weak  points  of  the  previous  models.  Applied  to  decision trees, the use of the gradient boosting technique results in models that strictly outperform random forests most of the time, while having similar properties. It may be one of the best, if not   best, algorithm for dealing with nonperceptual data today. Alongside deep learning, it’s one of the most commonly used techniques in Kaggle competitions.  gradient  boosting  machines  gradient boosting  the  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  15   1.2.5 Back to neural networks  Around  2010,  although  neural  networks  were  almost  completely  shunned  by  the scientific  community  at  large,  a  number  of  people  still  working  on  neural  networks started to make important breakthroughs: the groups of Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto, Yoshua Bengio at the University of Montreal, Yann LeCun at New York University, and IDSIA in Switzerland.  In  2011,  Dan  Ciresan  from  IDSIA  began  to  win  academic  image-classification competitions  with  GPU-trained  deep  neural  networks—the  first  practical  success  of modern  deep  learning.  But  the  watershed  moment  came  in  2012,  with  the  entry  of Hinton’s group in the yearly large-scale image-classification challenge ImageNet. The ImageNet  challenge  was  notoriously  difficult  at  the  time,  consisting  of  classifying high-resolution color images into 1,000 different categories after training on 1.4 million images.  In  2011,  the  top-five  accuracy  of  the  winning  model,  based  on  classical approaches  to  computer  vision,  was  only  74.3%.  Then,  in  2012,  a  team  led  by  Alex Krizhevsky and advised by Geoffrey Hinton was able to achieve a top-five accuracy of 83.6%--a  significant  breakthrough.  The  competition  has  been  dominated  by  deep convolutional neural networks every year since. By 2015, the winner reached an accuracy of 96.4%, and the classification task on ImageNet was considered to be a completely solved problem.  convnets  Since 2012, deep convolutional neural networks      have become the go-to algorithm  for  all  computer  vision  tasks;  more  generally,  they  work  on  all  perceptual tasks. At major computer vision conferences in 2015 and 2016, it was nearly impossible to find presentations that didn’t involve convnets in some form. At the same time, deep learning has also found applications in many other types of problems, such as natural language processing. It has completely replaced SVMs and decision trees in a wide range of applications. For instance, for several years, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, used decision tree–based methods for analysis of particle data from the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider  LHC ; but CERN eventually switched to Keras-based deep neural networks due to their higher performance and ease of training on large datasets.  1.2.6 What makes deep learning different  The primary reason deep learning took off so quickly is that it offered better performance on  many  problems.  But  that’s  not  the  only  reason.  Deep  learning  also  makes problem-solving much easier, because it completely automates what used to be the most crucial step in a machine-learning workflow: feature engineering.  techniques—shallow   Previous  machine-learning   involved transforming the input data into one or two successive representation spaces, usually via simple  transformations  such  as  high-dimensional  non-linear  projections   SVM   or decision trees. But the refined representations required by complex problems generally can’t be attained by such techniques. As such, humans had to go to great length to make the initial input data more amenable to processing by these methods: that is, they had to  learning—only   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  16   manually engineer good layers of representations for their data. This is called  feature engineering . Deep learning, on the other hand, completely automates this step: with deep learning, you learn all features in one pass rather than having to engineer them yourself. This  has  greatly  simplified  machine-learning  workflows,  often  replacing  sophisticated multistage pipelines with a single, simple, end-to-end deep-learning model.  You  may  ask,  if  the  crux  of  the  issue  is  to  have  multiple  successive  layers  of representation,  could  shallow  methods  be  applied  repeatedly  to  emulate  the  effects  of deep learning? In practice, there are fast-diminishing returns to successive applications of shallow-learning methods, because the optimal first representation layer in a three-layer model  isn’t  the  optimal  first  layer  in  a  one-layer  or  two-layer  model .  What  is transformative  about  deep  learning  is  that  it  allows  a  model  to  learn  all  layers  of representation  , as it’s called . With joint feature learning, whenever the model adjusts one of its internal features, all other  features  that  depend  on  it  automatically  adapt  to  the  change,  without  requiring human intervention. Everything is supervised by a single feedback signal: every change in the model serves the end goal. This is much more powerful than greedily stacking shallow models, because it allows for complex, abstract representations to be learned by breaking them down into long series of intermediate spaces  layers ; each space is only a simple transformation away from the previous one.  , at the same time, rather than in succession    greedily  jointly  These are the two essential characteristics of how deep learning learns from data: the  incremental,  layer-by-layer  way  in  which  increasingly  complex  representations  are developed these  intermediate  incremental  representations  are  learned jointly , each layer being updated to follow both the representational needs of the layer above and the needs of the layer below. Together, these two properties have made deep learning vastly more successful than previous approaches to machine learning.  ,  and  the  fact   A great way to get a sense of the current landscape of machine-learning algorithms and tools  is  to  look  at  machine-learning  competitions  on  Kaggle.  Due  to  its  highly competitive environment  some contests have thousands of entrants and million-dollar prizes  and to the wide variety of machine-learning problems covered, Kaggle offers a realistic  way  to  assess  what  works  and  what  doesn’t.  So,  what  kind  of  algorithm  is reliably winning competitions? What tools do top entrants use?  In 2016, Kaggle was dominated by two approaches: gradient boosting machines and deep learning. Specifically, gradient boosting is used for problems where structured data is  available,  whereas  deep  learning  is  used  for  perceptual  problems  such  as  image classification.  Practitioners  of  the  former  almost  always  use  the  excellent  XGBoost library. Meanwhile, most of the Kaggle entrants leveraging deep learning use the Keras library, due to its ease of use and flexibility. XGBoost and Keras both support the two most popular data science languages: R and Python.  These are the two techniques you should be the most familiar with in order to be successful  in  applied  machine  learning  today:  gradient  boosting  machines,  for  1.2.7 The modern machine-learning landscape  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  17   shallow-learning  problems;  and  deep  learning,  for  perceptual  problems.  In  technical terms, this means you’ll need to be familiar with XGB and Keras—the two libraries that currently dominate Kaggle competitions. With this book in hand, you’re already one big step closer.  1.3 Why deep learning? Why now?  The two key ideas of deep learning for computer vision—convolutional neural networks and  backpropagation—were  already  well  understood  in  1989.  The  Long  Short-Term Memory  LSTM  algorithm, which is fundamental to deep learning for time series, was developed in 1997 and has barely changed since. So why did deep learning only take off after 2012? What changed in these two decades?  In general, three technical forces are driving advances in machine learning:  Hardware Datasets and benchmarks Algorithmic advances  1.3.1 Hardware  Because  the  field  is  guided  by  experimental  findings  rather  than  by  theory, algorithmic advances only become possible when appropriate data and hardware were available to try new ideas  or scale up old ideas, as is often the case . Machine learning isn’t mathematics or physics, where major advances can be done with a pen and a piece of paper. It’s an engineering science.  The real bottlenecks throughout the 1990s and 2000s were data and hardware. But here’s  what  happened  during  that  time:  the  internet  took  off,  and  high-performance graphics chips were developed for the needs of the gaming market.  Between 1990 and 2010, off-the-shelf CPUs became faster by a factor of approximately 5,000. As a result, nowadays it’s possible to run small deep learning models on your laptop, whereas this would have been intractable 25 years ago.  But  typical  deep-learning  models  used  in  computer  vision  or  speech  recognition require  orders  of  magnitude  more  computational  power  than  what  your  laptop  can deliver. Throughout the 2000s, companies like NVIDIA and AMD have been investing billions of dollars in developing fast, massively parallel chips  graphical processing units [GPUs]   to  power  the  graphics  of  increasingly  photorealistic  video  games—cheap, single-purpose supercomputers designed to render complex 3D scenes on your screen in real  time.  This  investment  came  to  benefit  the  scientific  community  when,  in  2007, NVIDIA launched CUDA    , a programming interface for its line of GPUs. A small number of GPUs started replacing massive clusters of CPUs in  various  highly  parallelizable  applications,  beginning  with  physics  modeling.  Deep neural networks, consisting mostly of many small matrix multiplications, are also highly  developer.nvidia.com about-cuda  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  18   to  write  CUDA parallelizable;  and  around  2011,  some  researchers  began  5 implementations of neural nets—Dan Ciresan  and Alex Krizhevsky  were among the first.  4  Footnote 4mSee "Flexible, High Performance Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification,"  Proceedings of the 22nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence www.ijcai.org Proceedings 11 Papers 210.pdf.    2011 ,  Footnote 5mSee "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks," Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems  mng.bz 2286   25  2012 ,   .  What  happened  is  that  the  gaming  market  subsidized  supercomputing  for  the  next generation of artificial intelligence applications. Sometimes, big things begin as games. Today, the NVIDIA Titan X, a gaming GPU that cost $1,000 at the end of 2015, can deliver a peak of 6.6 TLOPS in single precision: that is, 6.6 trillion   operations per second. That’s about 350 times more than what you can get out of a modern laptop. On a Titan X, it takes only a couple of days to train an ImageNet model of the sort that would have won the ILSVRC competition a few years ago. Meanwhile, large companies train  deep-learning  models  on  clusters  of  hundreds  of  GPUs  of  a  type  developed specifically  for  the  needs  of  deep  learning,  such  as  the  NVIDIA  K80.  The  sheer computational power of such clusters is something that would never have been possible without modern GPUs.  float32  What’s  more,  the  deep-learning  industry  is  starting  to  go  beyond  GPUs  and  is investing  in  increasingly  specialized,  efficient  chips  for  deep  learning.  In  2016,  at  its annual I O convention, Google revealed its tensor processing unit  TPU  project: a new chip  design  developed  from  the  ground  up  to  run  deep  neural  networks,  which  is reportedly 10 times faster and far more energy efficient than top-of-line GPUs.  AI is sometimes heralded as the new industrial revolution. If deep learning is the steam engine of this revolution, then data is its coal: the raw material that powers our intelligent machines, without which nothing would be possible. When it comes to data, in addition to  the  exponential  progress  in  storage  hardware  over  the  past  20  years   following Moore’s law , the game changer has been the rise of the internet, making it feasible to collect and distribute very large datasets for machine learning. Today, large companies work  with  image  datasets,  video  datasets,  and  natural-language  datasets  that  couldn’t have  been  collected  without  the  internet.  User-generated  image  tags  on  Flickr,  for instance, have been a treasure trove of data for computer vision. So are YouTube videos. And Wikipedia is a key dataset for natural-language processing.  If there’s one dataset that has been a catalyst for the rise of deep learning, it’s the ImageNet dataset, consisting of 1.4 million images that have been hand-annotated with 1,000 image categories  1 category per image . But what makes ImageNet special isn’t just its large size, but also the yearly competition associated with it.6  1.3.2 Data  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  19   1.3.3 Algorithms  Footnote 6mThe ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge  ILSVRC , www.image-net.org challenges LSVRC.  As Kaggle has been demonstrating since 2010, public competitions are an excellent way  to  motivate  researchers  and  engineers  to  push  the  envelope.  Having  common benchmarks that researchers compete to beat has greatly helped the recent rise of deep learning.  In addition to hardware and data, until the late 2000s, we were missing a reliable way to train very deep neural networks. As a result, neural networks were still fairly shallow, using only one or two layers of representations; thus they weren’t able to shine against more refined shallow methods such as SVMs and random forests. The key issue was that of   through deep stacks of layers. The feedback signal used to train neural networks would fade away as the number of layers increased.  gradient propagation  This  changed  around  2009–2010  with  the  advent  of  several  simple  but  important  algorithmic improvements that allowed for better gradient propagation:  activation functions weight-initialization schemes   for neural layers  Better Better quickly abandoned Better  optimization schemes  , such as RMSProp and Adam  , starting with layer-wise pretraining, which was  Only when these improvements began to allow for training models with 10 or more  layers did deep learning start to shine.  Finally,  in  2014,  2015,  and  2016,  even  more  advanced  ways  to  help  gradient propagation  were  discovered,  such  as  batch  normalization,  residual  connections,  and depthwise  separable  convolutions.  Today  we  can  train  from  scratch  models  that  are thousands of layers deep.  As deep learning became the new state of the art for computer vision in 2012–2013, and eventually  for  all  perceptual  tasks,  industry  leaders  took  note.  What  followed  was  a gradual wave of industry investment far beyond anything previously seen in the history of AI.  In  2011,  right  before  deep  learning  took  the  spotlight,  the  total  venture  capital investment  in  AI  was  around  $19  million,  which  went  almost  entirely  to  practical applications  of  shallow  machine-learning  approaches.  By  2014,  it  had  risen  to  a staggering  $394  million.  Dozens  of  startups  launched  in  these  three  years,  trying  to capitalize on the deep-learning hype. Meanwhile, large tech companies such as Google, Facebook,  Baidu,  and  Microsoft  have  invested  in  internal  research  departments  in amounts that would most likely dwarf the flow of venture-capital money. Only a few numbers have surfaced: in 2013, Google acquired the deep-learning startup DeepMind for  a  reported  $500  million—the  largest  acquisition  of  an  AI  company  in  history.  In  1.3.4 A new wave of investment  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  20   2014,  Baidu  started  a  deep-learning  research  center  in  Silicon  Valley,  investing  $300 million in the project. The deep-learning hardware startup Nervana Systems was acquired by Intel in 2016 for over $400 million.  Machine learning—in particular, deep learning—has become central to the product strategy of these tech giants. In late 2015, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated, "Machine learning  is  a  core,  transformative  way  by  which  we’re  rethinking  how  we’re  doing everything.  We’re  thoughtfully  applying  it  across  all  our  products,  be  it  search,  ads, YouTube,  or  Play.  And  we’re  in  early  days,  but  you’ll  see  us—in  a  systematic way—apply machine learning in all these areas."  As  a  result  of  this  wave  of  investment,  the  number  of  people  working  on  deep learning went in just five years from a few hundred to tens of thousands, and research progress has reached a frenetic pace. There are currently no signs that this trend will slow any time soon.  1.3.5 The democratization of deep learning  One  the  key  factors  driving  this  inflow  of  new  faces  in  deep  learning  has  been  the democratization of the toolsets used in the field. In the early days, doing deep learning required significant C++ and CUDA expertise, which few people possessed. Nowadays, basic Python or R scripting skills suffice to do advanced deep-learning research. This has been  driven  most  notably  by  the  development  of  Theano  and  then  TensorFlow—two symbolic  tensor-manipulation  frameworks  that  support  auto-differentiation,  greatly simplifying the implementation of new models—and by the rise of user-friendly libraries such as Keras, which makes deep learning as easy as manipulating LEGO bricks. After its release early 2015, Keras quickly became the go-to deep-learning solution for large numbers of new startups, grad students, and researchers pivoting into the field.  1.3.6 Will it last?  Is  there  anything  special  about  deep  neural  networks  that  makes  them  the  "right" approach for companies to be investing in and for researchers to flock to? Or is deep learning just a fad that may not last? Will we still be using deep neural networks in 20 years?  The short answer is yes—deep learning has several properties that justify its status as an AI revolution, and it’s here to stay. We may not be using neural networks two decades from now, but whatever we use will directly inherit from modern deep learning and its core concepts. These important properties can be broadly sorted into three categories:  Simplicity—Deep learning removes the need for feature engineering, replacing complex, brittle, engineering-heavy pipelines with simple, end-to-end trainable models that are typically built using only five or six different tensor operations. Scalability—Deep learning is highly amenable to parallelization on GPUs or TPUs, so it can take full advantage of Moore’s law. In addition, deep-learning models are trained by iterating over small batches of data, allowing them to be trained on datasets of arbitrary size.  The only bottleneck is the amount of parallel computational power available, which, thanks to Moore’s law, is a fast-moving barrier.  Versatility and reusability—Unlike many prior machine-learning approaches,  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  21   deep-learning models can be trained on additional data without restarting from scratch, making them viable for continuous online learning—an important property for very large production models. Furthermore, trained deep-learning models are repurposable and thus reusable: for instance, it’s possible to take a deep-learning model trained for image classification and drop it into a video-processing pipeline. This allows us to reinvest previous work into increasingly complex and powerful models. This also makes deep learning applicable to fairly small datasets.  Deep  learning  has  only  been  in  the  spotlight  for  a  few  years,  and  we  haven’t  yet established the full scope of what it can do. With every passing month, we learn about new use cases and engineering improvements that lift previous limitations. Following a scientific revolution, progress generally follows a sigmoid curve: it starts with a period of fast  progress,  which  gradually  stabilizes  as  researchers  hit  hard  limitations,  and  then further improvements become incremental. Deep learning in 2017 seems to be in the first half of that sigmoid, with much more progress to come in the next few years.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  22   2  Before we begin: the mathematical blocks of neural networks  This chapter covers  A first example of a neural network Tensors and tensor operations How neural networks learn, via backpropagation and gradient descent  Understanding  deep  learning  requires  familiarity  with  many  simple  mathematical concepts: tensors, tensor operations, differentiation, gradient descent, and so on. Our goal in this chapter will be to build your intuition about these notions without getting overly technical.  In  particular,  we’ll  steer  away  from  mathematical  notation,  which  can  be off-putting for those without any mathematics background and isn’t strictly necessary to explain things well.  To add some context for tensors and gradient descent, we’ll begin the chapter with a practical example of a neural network. Then we’ll go over every new concept that’s been introduced, point by point. Keep in mind that these concepts will be essential for you to understand the practical examples that will come in the following chapters!  After  reading  this  chapter,  you’ll  have  an  intuitive  understanding  of  how  neural networks work, and you’ll be able to move on to practical applications—which will start with chapter 3.  2.1 A first look at a neural network  Let’s look at a concrete example of a neural network that uses the Keras R package to learn to classify hand-written digits. Unless you already have experience with Keras or similar libraries, you will not understand everything about this first example right away. You probably haven’t even installed Keras yet. Don’t worry, that is perfectly fine. In the next chapter, we will review each element in our example and explain them in detail. So don’t worry if some steps seem arbitrary or look like magic to you! We’ve got to start somewhere.  The problem we’re trying to solve here is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits  28 pixels by 28 pixels  into their 10 categories  0 to 9 . We’ll use the MNIST  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  23   dataset,  a  classic  dataset  in  the  machine-learning  community,  which  has  been  around almost as long as the field itself and has been intensively studied. It’s a set of 60,000 training  images,  plus  10,000  test  images,  assembled  by  the  National  Institute  of Standards  and  Technology   the  NIST  in  MNIST   in  the  1980s.  You  can  think  of "solving" MNIST as the "Hello World" of deep learning—it’s what you do to verify that your  algorithms  are  working  as  expected.  As  you  become  a  machine-  learning practitioner, you’ll see MNIST come up over and over again, in scientific papers, blog posts, and so on. You can see some MNIST samples in figure 2.1.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the images and the labels.  training set test set test_images   and   ,   The R   str     function is a convenient way to get a quick glimpse at the structure of  an array. Let’s use it to have a look at the training data:  > str train_images   int [1:60000, 1:28, 1:28] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... > str train_labels   int [1:60000 1d ] 5 0 4 1 9 2 1 3 1 4 ...

The workflow will be as follows: first we’ll feed the neural network the training data,  . The network will then learn to associate images and , and we’ll  train_images labels. Finally, we’ll ask the network to produce predictions for  verify whether these predictions match the labels from   train_labels  test_images  test_labels   and   .  Let’s  build  the  network—again,  remember  that  you  aren’t  supposed  to  understand  everything about this example yet.  Listing 2.2 The network architecture  network  %   layer_dense units = 512, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 28 * 28   %>%   layer_dense units = 10, activation = "softmax"   If you aren’t familliar with the pipe      operator used to invoke methods on the   object fear not, we’ll cover this when we review this example again towards the network end of this chapter. For now, read it in your head as "then"  e.g. start with a model, then add a layer, then add another layer, etc. .  %>%  layer  The core building block of neural networks is the   , a data-processing module that you can think of as a filter for data. Some data comes in, and it comes out in a more useful  form.

Most of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers that will implement a form of progressive  .

The  second   and  last   layer  is  a  10-way   also  called  softmax  layer, which means it will return an array of 10 probability scores  summing to 1 . Each score will be the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of our 10 digit classes.

Listing 2.3 The compilation step  network %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "categorical_crossentropy",   metrics = c "accuracy"     You’ll notice that the    function modifies the network in-place  rather than returning a new network object as is more conventional in R . We’ll describe the reason for this when we revisit the example later in the chapter.  compile    Before training, we’ll preprocess the data by reshaping it into the shape the network   interval.

We’ll cover the reason for this later on, when we talk about tensor reshaping.   function rather than the   array_reshape    dim<-    We also need to categorically encode the labels, a step that’s explained in chapter 3.  Listing 2.5 Preparing the labels  train_labels <- to_categorical train_labels  test_labels <- to_categorical test_labels   We’re  now  ready  to  train  the  network,  which  in  Keras  is  done  via  a  call  to  the  network’s  fit   method: we   fit   the model to its training data:  > network %>% fit train_images, train_labels, epochs = 5, batch_size = 128  Epoch 1 5 60000 60000 [==============================] - 9s - loss: 0.2575 - acc: 0.9255 Epoch 2 5 60000 60000 [==============================] - 10s - loss: 0.1038 - acc: 0.9687 Epoch 3 5 60000 60000 [==============================] - 10s - loss: 0.0688 - acc: 0.9793 Epoch 4 5 60000 60000 [==============================] - 9s - loss: 0.0496 - acc: 0.9855 Epoch 5 5 60000 60000 [==============================] - 9s - loss: 0.0372 - acc: 0.9883  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  26   Two quantities are displayed during training: the   loss   of the network over the training  data, and the accuracy of the network over the training data.  We quickly reach an accuracy of 0.989  98.9%  on the training data. Now let’s check  that the model performs well on the test set, too:  > metrics  % evaluate test_images, test_labels  > metrics $loss [1] 0.07519608  $acc [1] 0.9785  The test-set accuracy turns out to be 97.8%--that’s quite a bit lower than the training set accuracy. This gap between training accuracy and test accuracy is an example of  overfitting : the fact that machine-learning models tend to perform worse on new data than on their training data. Overfitting will be a central topic in chapter 3.  Let’s generate predictions for the first 10 samples of the test set:  Listing 2.6 Generating predictions  > network %>% predict_classes test_images[1:10,]   [1] 7 2 1 0 4 1 4 9 5 9  This  concludes  our  first  example—you  just  saw  how  you  can  build  and  a  train  a neural network to classify handwritten digits in less than 20 lines of R code. In the next chapter,  we’ll  go  into  detail  about  every  moving  piece  we  just  previewed  and  clarify what’s going on behind the scenes. You’ll learn about tensors, the data-storing objects going into the network; about tensor operations, which layers are made of; and about gradient descent, which allows your network to learn from its training examples.  2.2 Data representations for neural networks  tensors  In the previous example, we started from data stored in multidimensional arrays, also called  . In general, all current machine-learning systems use tensors as their basic data  structure.  Tensors  are  fundamental  to  the  field—so  fundamental  that  Google’s TensorFlow was named after them. So what’s a tensor?  Tensors  are  a  generalization  of  vectors  and  matrices  to  an  arbitrary  number  of dimensions   note  that  in  the  context  of  tensors,  "dimension"  is  often  called  "axis" . Within R, vectors are used to create and manipulate 1D tensors and matrices are used for 2D tensors. For higher level dimensions   objects  which support any number of dimensions  are used.  array  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  27   2.2.1 Scalars  0D tensors   A  tensor  that  contains  only  one  number  is  called  a     or  scalar  tensor,  or 0-dimensional  tensor,  or  0D  tensor .  While  R  does  not  have  a  data  type  to  represent scalars  all numeric objects are vectors, matrices, or arrays , an R vector that is always length 1 is conceptually similar to a scalar.  scalar  2.2.2 Vectors  1D tensors   A one dimensionanl array of numbers is called a  to have exactly one axis. We can convert the R vector to an  inspect it’s dimensions:  vector  , or 1D tensor.

A 5D vector has only one axis and has five dimensions along its axis, whereas a 5D tensor has five axes  and may have any number of dimensions along each axis .   can denote either the number of entries along a specific axis  as in the case of our 5D vector  or the number of axes in a tensor  such as a 5D tensor , which can be confusing at times. In the latter case, it’s technically more correct to talk about    the rank of a tensor being the number of axes , but the ambiguous notation    is common regardless.  a tensor of rank 5  Dimensionality  5D tensor  2.2.3 Matrices  2D tensors   A two dimensional array of numbers is a matrix, or 2D tensor. A matrix has two axes  often referred to   . You can visually interpret a matrix as a rectangular grid of numbers:  columns  rows   and   Listing 2.8 An R matrix  > x <- matrix rep 0, 3*5 , nrow = 3, ncol = 5   > x      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,]    0    0    0    0    0 [2,]    0    0    0    0    0 [3,]    0    0    0    0    0  > dim x  [1] 3 5  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  28   2.2.4 3D tensors and higher-dimensional tensors  If you pack such matrices in a new array, you obtain a 3D tensor, which you can visually interpret as a cube of numbers:  Listing 2.9 An R 3D array  > x <- array rep 0, 2*3*2 , dim = c 2,3,2    > str x  num [1:2, 1:3, 1:2] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  > dim x  [1] 2 3 2  By packing 3D tensors in an array, you can create a 4D tensor, and so on. In deep learning, you’ll generally manipulate tensors that are 0D to 4D, although you may go up to 5D if you process video data.  2.2.5 Key attributes  A tensor is defined by three key attributes:  Number of axes  rank —For instance, a 3D tensor has three axes, and a matrix has two axes. Shape—This is an integer vector that describes how many dimensions the tensor has along each axis. For instance, the previous matrix example has shape  tensor example has shape  as Data type—This is the type of the data contained in the tensor; for instance, a tensor’s type could be   tensor. However, since tensors live in pre-allocated contiguous memory segments, and strings, being variable-length, would preclude the use of this implementation, they are more rarely used.  . You can access the dimensions of any array using the   . A vector has a shape with a single element, such  . On rare occasions, you may see a    function.   3, 3, 5   character  integer   3, 5   double  dim     or    5   , and the 3D  To make this more concrete, let’s look back at the data we processed in the MNIST  example. First, we load the MNIST dataset:  Next we display the number of axes of the tensor   train_images  :  library keras   mnist <- dataset_mnist   train_images <- mnist$train$x train_labels <- mnist$train$y test_images <- mnist$test$x test_labels <- mnist$test$y  > length dim train_images   [1] 3  Here’s its shape:  > dim train_images   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  29   [1] 60000    28    28  And this is its data type:  > typeof train_images  [1] "integer"  So what we have here is a 3D tensor of integers. More precisely, it’s an array of 60,000  matrices  of  28  ×  28  integers.  Each  such  matrix  is  a  grayscale  image,  with coefficients between 0 and 255.  Let’s plot the 5th digit in this 3D tensor:  Listing 2.10 Displaying the 5th digit  digit <- train_images[5,,] plot as.raster digit, max = 255    Figure 2.2 The 5th sample in our dataset  2.2.6 Manipulating tensors in R  selected In the previous example, we  syntax  .  Selecting  specific  elements  in  a  tensor  is  called  train_images[i,,] slicing . Let’s take a look at the tensor slicing operations that you can do on R arrays.   a specific digit alongside the first axis using the tensor  The following selects digits 10 to 99 and puts them in an array of shape  90, 28, :  28   It’s equivalent to this more detailed notation, which specifies a start index and stop  Listing 2.11 Slicing a tensor  > my_slice <- train_images[10:99,,] > dim my_slice  [1] 90 28 28  index for the slice along each tensor axis.  Listing 2.12 Advanced tensor slicing  > my_slice <- train_images[10:99,1:28,1:28] > dim my_slice  [1] 90 28 28  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  30   In  general,  you  may  select  between  any  two  indices  along  each  tensor  axis.  For instance, in order to select 14 × 14 pixels in the bottom-right corner of all images, you’d do this:  Listing 2.13 Advanced tensor slicing  continued   my_slice <- train_images[, 15:28, 15:28]  2.2.7 The notion of data batches  In general, the first axis in all data tensors you’ll come across in deep learning will be the samples axis  . In the MNIST example, samples are images of digits.    sometimes called the   samples dimension  In addition, deep-learning models don’t process an entire dataset at once; rather, they break the data into small batches. Concretely, here’s one batch of our MNIST digits, with batch size of 128:  Listing 2.14 Slicing a tensor into batches  batch <- train_images[1:128,,] batch <- train_images[129:256,,]  When considering such a batch tensor, the first axis is called the   batch .  This  is  a  term  you’ll  frequently  encounter  when  using  Keras  and  other  batch axis   or   dimension deep-learning libraries.  2.2.8 Real-world examples of data tensors  Let’s  make  data  tensors  more  concrete  with  a  few  examples  similar  to  what  you’ll encounter  later.  The  data  you’ll  manipulate  will  almost  always  fall  into  one  of  the following categories:  Vector data—2D tensors of shape  samples, features  Timeseries data or sequence data—3D tensors of shape  samples, timesteps, features  Images—4D tensors of shape  channels, height, width  Video—5D tensors of shape   samples, frames, channels, height, width    samples, frames, height, width, channels    samples, height, width, channels    or    samples,   or   2.2.9 Vector data  This is the most common case. In such a dataset, each single data point can be encoded as a vector, and thus a batch of data will be encoded as a 2D tensor  that is, an array of vectors , where the first axis is the    and the second axis is the   samples axis  features axis  .  Let’s take a look at two examples:  An actuarial dataset of people, where we consider each person’s age, ZIP code, and  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  31   income. Each person can be characterized as a vector of 3 values, and thus an entire dataset of 100,000 people can be stored in a 2D tensor of shape  A dataset of text documents, where we represent each document by the counts of how many times each word appears in it  out of a dictionary of 20,000 common words . Each document can be encoded as a vector of 20,000 values  one count per word in the dictionary , and thus an entire dataset of 500 documents can be stored in a tensor of shape  500, 20000    100000, 3   .  .  2.2.10 Timeseries data or sequence data  Whenever time matters in your data  or the notion of sequence order , it makes sense to store  it  in  a  3D  tensor  with  an  explicit  time  axis.  Each  sample  can  be  encoded  as  a sequence of vectors  a 2D tensor , and thus a batch of data will be encoded as a 3D tensor  see figure 2.3 .  Figure 2.3 A 3D timeseries data tensor  The time axis is always the second axis, by convention. Let’s have a look at a few  examples:   390, 3     there are 390 minutes in a trading day , and 250 days worth of data can . Here, each sample would be one day’s  A dataset of stock prices. Every minute, we store the current price of the stock, the highest price in the past minute, and the lowest price in the past minute. Thus every minute is encoded as a 3D vector, an entire day of trading is encoded as a 2D tensor of shape be stored in a 3D tensor of shape  worth of data. A dataset of tweets, where we encode each tweet as a sequence of 140 characters out of an alphabet of 128 unique characters. In this setting, each character can be encoded as a binary vector of size 128  an all-zeros vector except for a 1 entry at the index corresponding to the character . Then each tweet can be encoded as a 2D tensor of shape   140, 128   1000000, 140, 128   , and a dataset of 1 million tweets can be stored in a tensor of shape    250, 390, 3   .  2.2.11 Image data  Images  typically  have  three  dimensions:  height,  width,  and  color  depth.  Although grayscale images  like our MNIST digits  have only a single color channel and could thus be  stored  in  2D  tensors,  by  convention  image  tensors  are  always  3D,  with  a one-dimensional color channel for grayscale images. A batch of 128 grayscale images of size 256 × 256 could thus be stored in a tensor of shape  , and a batch of 128 color images could be stored in a tensor of shape   128, 256, 256, 3   see figure 2.4 .   128, 256, 256, 1   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  32   Figure 2.4 A 4D image data tensor  channels-first convention   channels-first  There are two conventions for shapes of images tensors: the    convention   convention   used  by  Theano .  The  used  by  TensorFlow   and  the  TensorFlow machine-learning framework, from Google, places the color-depth axis at the  end,  as  you  just  saw:  .  Meanwhile, Theano places the color depth axis right after the batch axis:  samples, color_depth, . With the Theano convention, the previous examples would become  height, width  .  The  Keras  framework  provides   samples,  height,  width,  color_depth    128,  3,  256,  256   channels-last    and    128,  1,  256,  256  support for both formats.  2.2.12 Video data  Video data is one of the few types of real-world data for which you’ll need 5D tensors. A video  can  be  understood  as  a  sequence  of  frames,  each  frame  being  a  color  image. Because each frame can be stored in a 3D tensor  , a sequence  of  frames  can  be  stored  in  4D  tensor   frames,  height,  width, , and thus a batch of different videos can be stored in a 5D tensor of shape color_depth    height, width, color_depth    samples, frames, height, width, color_depth   .   4, 240, 256, 144, 3   For instance, a 60-second, 256 × 144 YouTube video clip sampled at 4 frames per second would have 240 frames. A batch of four such video clips would be stored in a . That’s a total of 106,168,320 values! If the tensor of shape  data type of the tensor is double, then each value is stored in  , so the tensor would represent 810 MB. Heavy! Videos you encounter in real life are much lighter, because they aren’t stored in   and they’re typically compressed by a large factor  such as in the MPEG format .  64  bits  float32  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  33   2.3 The gears of neural networks: tensor operations  Much  as  any  computer  program  can  be  ultimately  reduced  to  a  small  set  of  binary operations on binary inputs  AND, OR, NOR, and so on , all transformations learned by deep neural networks can be reduced to a handful of   applied to tensors of numeric data. For instance, it’s possible to add tensors, multiply tensors, and so on.  tensor operations  In our initial example, we were building our network by stacking dense layers on top  of each other. A layer instance looks like this:  layer_dense units = 512, activation = "relu"   This  layer  can  be  interpreted  as  a  function,  which  takes  as  input  a  2D  tensor  and returns another 2D tensor—a new representation for the input tensor. Specifically, the function is as follows  where   is a vector, both attributes of the layer :   is a 2D tensor and   W  b  output = relu dot W, input  + b   Let’s unpack this. We have three tensor operations here: a dot product      between , an addition     between the resulting 2D tensor  dot  W  the input tensor and a tensor named  and a vector   , and finally a   relu  b   operation.   relu x   max x, 0   .  +  is   NOTE  Note Although this section deals entirely with linear algebra expressions, you won’t find any mathematical notation here. We’ve found that mathematical concepts can be more readily mastered by readers with no mathematical background  if  they’re  expressed  as  short  code  snippets  instead  of mathematical equations. So we’ll use R code throughout.  2.3.1 Element-wise operations  relu  element-wise   operation and addition are   The   operations: operations that are applied independently to each entry in the tensors being considered. This means these operations are highly amenable to massively parallel implementations    implementations, a  term  that  comes  from  the    supercomputer  architecture  from  the 1970–1990 period . If you wanted to write a naive R implementation of an element-wise operation, you’d use a  relu operation:   loop, as in this naive implementation of an element-wise   vector  processor  vectorized  for  naive_relu <- function x  {   for  i in nrow x       for  j in ncol x         x[i, j] <- max x[i, j], 0    x }  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  34   x is a 2D tensor  R matrix   You’d do the same for addition:  naive_add <- function x, y  {   for  i in nrow x       for  j in ncol x         x[i, j] = x[i, j] + y[i, j]   x }  x and y are 2D tensors  matrices   On the same principle, you can do element-wise multiplication, subtraction, and so  on.  In  practice,  when  dealing  with  R  arrays,  these  operations  are  available  as well-optimized  built-in  R  functions,  which  themselves  delegate  the  heavy  lifting  to  a BLAS implementation  Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms  if you have one installed, which  you  should.  BLAS  are  low-level,  highly-parallel,  efficient  tensor  manipulation routines typically implemented in Fortran or C.  So in R you can do the following, and it will be blazing fast:  Listing 2.15 Native element-wise operation in R   Element-wise addition z <- x + y   Element-wise relu z <- pmax z, 0   2.3.2 Operations involving tensors of different dimensions  Our earlier naive implementation of   only supports the addition of 2D tensors with identical shapes. But in the dense layer introduced earlier, we added a 2D tensor with  a  vector.

Mathematically, what does the dot operation do? Let’s start with the dot product of  two vectors    and   x  . It’s computed as follows:  y  Listing 2.19 A naive implementation of dot products  naive_vector_dot <- function x, y  {   z <- 0   for  i in 1:length x       z <- z + x[[i]] * y[[i]]   z }  x and y are 1D tensors  vectors   You’ll have noticed that the dot product between two vectors is a scalar and that only  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  36   vectors with the same number of elements are compatible for a dot product.  You can also take the dot product between a matrix   vector whose elements are the dot products between  it as follows:  x   and a vector   and the rows of  x  , which returns a y . You implement  y  naive_matrix_vector_dot <- function x, y  {   z <- rep 0, nrow x     for  i in 1:nrow x       for  j in 1:ncol x         z[[i]] <- z[[i]] + x[[i, j]] * y[[j]]   z }  x is a 2D tensor  matrix  y is a 1D tensor  vector   naive_matrix_vector_dot <- function x, y  {   z <- rep 0, nrow x     for  i in 1:nrow x       z[[i]] <- naive_vector_dot x[i,], y    z }  You could also reuse the code we wrote previously, which highlights the relationship  between a matrix-vector product and a vector product:  Note that as soon as one of the two tensors has more than one dimension,   %*%   is no  longer symmetric, which is to say that   x %*% y   isn’t the same as   y %*% x  .  Of course, a dot product generalizes to tensors with an arbitrary number of axes. The most common applications may be the dot product between two matrices. You can take the dot product of two matrices  . ncol x  == nrow y  ,  where  coefficients  are  the The  result  is  a  matrix  with  shape  vector  products  between  the  rows  of  .

Although it wasn’t used in the dense layers in our first neural network example, we used it when we preprocessed the digits data before feeding them into our network:  train_images <- array_reshape train_images, c 60000, 28 * 28    array_reshape    Note that we use the    function rather than the    function to reshape the array. This is so that the data is re-interpreted using row-major semantics  as opposed to R’s default column-major semantics , which is in turn compatible with the way that the numerical libraries called by Keras  e.g. NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.  interpret array  dimensions.  You  should  always  use  the    function  when reshaping R arrays that will be passed to Keras.  array_reshape    dim<-    Reshaping a tensor means rearranging its rows and columns to match a target shape. Naturally, the reshaped tensor has the same total number of coefficients as the initial tensor. Reshaping is best understood via simple examples:  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  38   > x <- matrix c 0, 1,                 2, 3,                 4, 5 ,              nrow = 3, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE   > x      [,1] [,2] [1,]    0    1 [2,]    2    3 [3,]    4    5  > x <- array_reshape x, dim = c 6, 1   > x      [,1] [1,]    0 [2,]    1 [3,]    2 [4,]    3 [5,]    4 [6,]    5   > x <- array_reshape x, dim = c 2, 3    > x       [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,]    0    1    2 [2,]    3    4    5  > x <- matrix 0, nrow = 300, ncol = 20  > dim x  [1] 300  20  > x <- t x  > dim x  [1]  20 300  A  special  case  of  reshaping  that’s  commonly  encountered  is  the   a matrix means exchanging its rows and its columns, so that  t     function can be used to transpose a matrix:  Transposing . The  x[, i]  transposition x[i,]  .   becomes  2.3.5 Geometric interpretation of tensor operations  Because the contents of the tensors manipulated by tensor operations can be interpreted as coordinates of points in some geometric space, all tensor operations have a geometric interpretation. For instance, let’s consider addition. We’ll start with the following vector:  A = [0.5, 1.0]  It’s a point in a 2D space  see figure 2.6 . It’s common to picture a vector as an arrow  linking the origin to the point, as shown in figure 2.7.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  39   Figure 2.6 A point in a 2D space  Figure 2.7 A point in a 2D space pictured as an arrow  Let’s consider a new point,   , which we’ll add to the previous one. This  is  done  geometrically  by  chaining  together  the  vector  arrows,  with  the  resulting location being the vector representing the sum of the previous two vectors  see figure 2.8 .  B = [1, 0.25]  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  40   Figure 2.8 Geometric interpretation of the sum of two vectors  In general, elementary geometric operations such as affine transformations, rotations, scaling, and so on can be expressed as tensor operations. For instance, a rotation of a 2D vector by an angle theta can be achieved via a dot product with a 2 × 2 matrix R = [u,  and  v]   and both vectors of the plane:   u = [cos theta , sin theta ]  , where    and   u  v  v = [-sin theta , cos theta ]  .  2.3.6 A geometric interpretation of deep learning  You just learned that neural networks consist entirely of chains of tensor operations and that all of these tensor operations are just geometric transformations of the input data. It follows  that  you  can  interpret  a  neural  network  as  a  very  complex  geometric transformation  in  a  high-dimensional  space,  implemented  via  a  long  series  of  simple steps.  In 3D, the following mental image may prove useful. Imagine two sheets of colored paper: one red and one blue. Put one on top of the other. Now crumple them together into a small ball. That crumpled paper ball is your input data, and each sheet of paper is a class  of  data  in  a  classification  problem.  What  a  neural  network   or  any  other machine-learning model  is meant to do is figure out a transformation of the paper ball that would uncrumple it, so as to make the two classes cleanly separable again. With deep learning, this would be implemented as a series of simple transformations of the 3D space, such as those you could apply on the paper ball with your fingers, one movement at a time.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  41   Figure 2.9 Uncrumpling a complicated manifold of data  Uncrumpling  paper  balls  is  what  machine  learning  is  about:  finding  neat representations for complex, highly folded data manifolds. At this point, you should have a pretty good intuition as to why deep learning excels at this: it takes the approach of incrementally decomposing a complicated geometric transformation into a long chain of elementary ones, which is pretty much the strategy a human would follow to uncrumple a paper ball. Each layer in a deep network applies a transformation that disentangles the data  a  little—and  a  deep  stack  of  layers  makes  tractable  an  extremely  complicated disentanglement process.  2.4 The engine of neural networks: gradient-based optimization  As you saw in the previous section, each neural layer from our first network example transforms its input data as follows:  output = relu dot W, input  + b   b  W   and   In this expression,  weights   are tensors that are attributes of the layer. They’re called the    attributes, respectively .  These  weights  contain  the  information  learned  by  the  network  from exposure to training data.  trainable  parameters    of  the  layer   the   kernel    and     or   bias  , when   Initially, these weight matrices are filled with small random values  a step called  random initialization  . Of course, there’s no reason to expect that  relu dot W, input   are random, would yield any useful representations. The resulting + b  b representations  are  meaningless—but  they’re  a  starting  point.  What  comes  next  is  to gradually adjust these weights, based on a feedback signal. This gradual adjustment, also called  , is basically the learning that machine learning is all about.  training   and   W  This  happens  within  what’s  called  a   training  loop follows.

The network that has "learned" to map its inputs to correct targets. From afar, it may look like magic, but when you reduce it to elementary steps, it turns out to be simple.   and expected targets   y_pred  y  Step 1 sounds easy enough—just I O code. Steps 2 and 3 are merely the application of a handful of tensor operations, so you could implement these steps purely from what you learned in the previous section. The difficult part is step 4: updating the network’s weights. Given an individual weight coefficient in the network, how can you compute whether the coefficient should be increased or decreased, and by how much?  One naive solution would be to freeze all weights in the network except the one scalar coefficient being considered, and try different values for this coefficient. Let’s say the initial value of the coefficient is 0.3. After the forward pass on a batch of data, the loss of the network on the batch is 0.5. If you change the coefficient’s value to 0.35 and re-run the forward pass, the loss increases to 0.6. But if you lower the coefficient to 0.25, the loss  falls  to  0.4.  In  this  case,  it  seems  that  updating  the  coefficient  by  -0.05  would contribute to minimizing the loss. This would have to be repeated for all coefficients in the network.  But such an approach would be horribly inefficient, because you’d need to compute two forward passes  which are expensive  for every individual coefficient  and there are many, usually thousands and sometimes up to millions . A much better approach is to take advantage of the fact that all operations used in the network are  , and compute the   of the loss with regard to the network’s coefficients. You can then move  the  coefficients  in  the  opposite  direction  from  the  gradient,  thus  decreasing  the loss.  differentiable  gradient  If you already know what    is, you can skip to section  2.4.3.

This can be done by solving the equation   variables,  is the number of coefficients in the network. Although it would be possible to where  solve such an equation for for   = 3, doing so is intractable for real neural networks, where the number of parameters is never less than a few thousand and can often be several tens of millions.  . This is a polynomial equation of    = 2 or    for   N  N  N  N  W  Instead, you can use the four-step algorithm outlined at the beginning of this section: you modify the parameters little by little based on the current loss value on a random batch of data. Because you’re dealing with a differentiable function, you can compute its gradient, which gives you an efficient way to implement step 4.

The term   Easy  enough!  What  we’ve  just  described  is  called  mini-batch  stochastic  gradient descent  refers to the fact that each batch of data is drawn at random    .

If   is too large, your updates may end up taking you to completely random locations on the curve.  step   SGD  as opposed to   Note  that  a  variant  of  the  mini-batch  SGD  algorithm  would  be  to  draw  a  single sample and target at each iteration, rather than drawing a batch of data.

The efficient compromise between these two extremes is to use mini-batches of reasonable size.   data available, which is called   batch SGD  mini-batch  all  Although figure 2.11 illustrates gradient descent in a 1D parameter space, in practice you’ll use gradient descent in highly dimensional spaces: every weight coefficient in a neural network is a free dimension in the space, and there may be tens of thousands or even  millions  of  them.  To  help  you  build  intuition  about  loss  surfaces,  you  can  also visualize gradient descent along a 2D loss surface, as shown in figure 2.12. But you can’t possibly visualize what the actual process of training a neural network looks like—you can’t represent a 1,000,000-dimensional space in a way that makes sense to humans. As such,  it’s  good  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  intuitions  you  develop  through  these  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  46   low-dimensional  representations  may  not  always  be  accurate  in  practice.  This  has historically been a source of issues in the world of deep-learning research.  Figure 2.12 Gradient descent down a 2D loss surface  two learnable parameters   Additionally, there exist multiple variants of SGD that differ by taking into account previous weight updates when computing the next weight update, rather than just looking at the current value of the gradients. There is, for instance, SGD with momentum, as well as  Adagrad,  RMSProp,  and  several  others.  Such  variants  are  known  as  optimization methods , which is used in many of these  variants,  deserves  your  attention.  Momentum  addresses  two  issues  with  SGD: convergence speed and local minima. Consider figure 2.13, which shows the curve of a loss as a function of a network parameter.  . In particular, the concept of   momentum  optimizers   or   Figure 2.13 A local minimum and a global minimum  As you can see, around a certain parameter value, there is a   local minimum  : around  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  47   that point, moving left would result in the loss increasing, but so would moving right. If the parameter under consideration were being optimized via SGD with a small learning rate,  then  the  optimization  process  would  get  stuck  at  the  local  minimum  instead  of making its way to the global minimum.  You  can  avoid  such  issues  by  using  momentum,  which  draws  inspiration  from physics. A useful mental image here is to think of the optimization process as a small ball rolling down the loss curve. If it has enough momentum, the ball won’t get stuck in a ravine and will end up at the global minimum. Momentum is implemented by moving the ball at each step based not only on the current slope value  current acceleration  but also based on the current velocity  resulting from past acceleration . In practice, this means updating the parameter   based not only on the current gradient value but also on the previous parameter update, such as in this naive implementation:  w  past_velocity <- 0 momentum <- 0.1 while  loss > 0.01  {   params <- get_current_parameters     w <- params$w   loss <- params$loss   gradient <- params$gradient    velocity <- past_velocity * momentum + learning_rate * gradient   w <- w + momentum * velocity - learning_rate * gradient   past_velocity <- velocity    update_parameter w  }  2.4.4 Chaining derivatives: the backpropagation algorithm  In the previous algorithm, we casually assumed that because a function is differentiable, we can explicitly compute its derivative. In practice, a neural-network function consists of  many  tensor  operations  chained  together,  each  of  which  has  a  simple,  known derivative. For instance, this is a network  , and , with weight matrices  c   composed of three tensor operations   , and   W1 W2  ,  a b  W3  f  :  ,  f W1, W2, W3  = a W1, b W2, c W3     :   chain rule f g x   = f' g x   * g' x   Calculus  tells  us  that  such  a  chain  of  functions  can  be  differentiated  using  the following identity, called the  . Applying the chain rule to the computation of the gradient values of a neural network gives rise to an reverse-mode differentiation algorithm called   . Backpropagation starts with the final loss value and works backward from the top layers to  the  bottom  layers,  applying  the  chain  rule  to  compute  the  contribution  that  each parameter had in the loss value.    also sometimes called   backpropagation  Nowadays,  and  for  years  to  come,  people  will  implement  networks  in  modern frameworks  that  are  capable  of  ,  such  as  TensorFlow.  This means, given a chain of operations with a known derivative, they can compute a gradient   symbolic  differentiation  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  48   function  for the chain  by applying the chain rule  that maps network parameter values to gradient values. When you have access to such a function, the backward pass is reduced to a call to this gradient function. Thanks to symbolic differentiation, you’ll never have to implement the backpropagation algorithm by hand. For this reason, we won’t waste your time and focus on deriving the exact formulation of the backpropagation algorithm in these pages. All you need is a good understanding of how gradient-based optimization works.  2.5 Looking back at our first example  You’ve  reached  the  end  of  this  chapter,  and  you  should  now  have  a  general understanding of what’s going on behind the scenes in a neural network. Let’s go back to the first example and review each piece of it in the light of what you’ve learned in the previous three sections.  This was the input data:  library keras   mnist <- dataset_mnist    train_images <- mnist$train$x train_images <- array_reshape train_images, c 60000, 28 * 28   train_images <- train_images   255  test_images <- mnist$test$x test_images <- array_reshape test_images, c 10000, 28 * 28   test_images <- test_images   255  784   Now you understand that our input images are stored in tensors of shape   60000,   training data  and  This was our network:    test data  respectively.   10000, 784   network  %   layer_dense units = 512, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 28*28   %>%   layer_dense units = 10, activation = "softmax"   Now you understand that this network consists of a chain of two dense layers, that each  layer  applies  a  few  simple  tensor  operations  to  the  input  data,  and  that  these operations involve weight tensors.

This  operator  comes  from  the    package,  and  is shorthand for passing the value on it’s left hand side as the first argument to the function on the right hand side. We could have equally written the above as:  magrittr  %>%  network <- keras_model_sequential   layer_dense network, units = 512, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 28*28   layer_dense network, units = 10, activation = "softmax"   %>%  Using the   results in code that is more readable and compact, so we’ll use that form throughout the book.

Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  51   2.6 Summary  Learning means a finding a combination of model parameters that minimizes a loss function for a given set of training data samples and their corresponding targets. Learning happens by drawing random batches of data samples and their targets, and computing the gradient of the network parameters with respect to the loss on the batch. The network parameters are then moved a bit  the magnitude of the move is defined by the learning rate  in the opposite direction from the gradient. The entire learning process is made possible by the fact that neural networks are chains of differentiable tensor operations, and thus it’s possible to apply the chain rule of derivation to find the gradient function mapping the current parameters and current batch of data to a gradient value. Two key concepts you’ll see come up a lot in future chapters are  These are the two things you need to define before you begin feeding data into a network.

You’ll consolidate the knowledge you gained from our first practical example in chapter 2, and you’ll apply what you’ve learned to three new problems covering the three  most  common  use  cases  of  neural  networks:  binary  classification,  multiclass classification, and scalar regression.  In this chapter, we’ll take a closer look at the core components of neural networks  that we introduced in chapter 2: layers, networks, objective functions, and optimizers.  We’ll give you a quick introduction to Keras, the deep-learning library that we’ll use throughout the book. You’ll set up deep-learning workstation, with TensorFlow, Keras, and  GPU  support.

Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  53   3.1 Anatomy of a neural network  As  you  saw  in  the  previous  chapters,  training  a  neural  network  revolves  around  the following objects:  Layers, which are combined into a  The  and corresponding  The The  input data loss function optimizer  , which defines the feedback signal used for learning  , which determines how learning proceeds    or   model     network targets  You can visualize their interaction as illustrated in figure 3.1: the network, composed of layers that are chained together, maps the input data to predictions. The loss function then compares these predictions to the targets, producing a loss value: a measure of how well the network’s predictions match what was expected. The optimizer uses this loss value to update the network’s weights.  Figure 3.1 Relationship between the network, layers, loss function, and optimizer  Let’s take a closer look at layers, networks, loss functions, and optimizers.  3.1.1 Layers: the building blocks of deep learning  The  fundamental  data  structure  in  neural  networks  is  the  ,  to  which  you  were introduced in chapter 2. A layer is a data-processing module that takes as input one or more tensors and that outputs one or more tensors. Some layers are stateless, but more frequently layers have a state: the layer’s  , one or several tensors learned with stochastic gradient descent, which together contain the network’s   knowledge  weights  layer  .  Different layers are appropriate for different tensor formats and different types of data processing. For instance, simple vector data, stored in 2D tensors of shape   samples,  or features  dense  function in Keras . Sequence data, stored in 3D tensors  , is often processed by    layers, also called   densely connected  fully connected   layers  the   layer_dense  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  54    samples, timesteps, features    layers .

You can think of layers as the LEGO bricks of deep learning, a metaphor that is made explicit by frameworks like Keras. Building deep-learning models in Keras is done by clipping  together  compatible  layers  to  form  useful  data-transformation  pipelines.  The notion of   here refers specifically to the fact that every layer will only accept input tensors of a certain shape and will return output tensors of a certain shape. Consider the following example:  layer compatibility  layer <- layer_dense units = 32, input_shape = c 784    We’re  creating  a  layer  that  will  only  accept  as  input  2D  tensors  where  the  first dimension is 784  the first dimension, the batch dimension, is unspecified, and thus any value would be accepted . This layer will return a tensor where the first dimension has been transformed to be 32.  Thus  this  layer  can  only  be  connected  to  a  downstream  layer  that  expects 32-dimensional vectors as its input. When using Keras, you don’t have to worry about compatibility, because the layers you add to your models are dynamically built to match the shape of the incoming layer. For instance, suppose you write the following:  model  %   layer_dense units = 32, input_shape = c 784   %>%   layer_dense units = 32   The second layer didn’t receive an input shape argument—instead, it automatically  inferred its input shape as being the output shape of the layer that came before.  3.1.2 Models: networks of layers  A deep-learning model is a directed, acyclic graph of layers. The most common instance is a linear stack of layers, mapping a single input to a single output.  But as you move forward, you’ll be exposed to a much broader variety of network  topologies. Some common ones include the following:  Two-branch networks Multihead networks Inception blocks  The topology of a network defines a   . You may remember that in chapter 1, we defined machine learning as "searching for useful representations of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from some feedback signal."  By  choosing  a  network  topology,  you  constrain  your  space  of  possibilities  hypothesis space  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  55    hypothesis space  to a specific series of tensor operations, mapping input data to output data. What you’ll then be searching for is a good set of values for the weight tensors involved in these tensor operations.  Picking the right network architecture is more an art than a science; and although there are some best practices and principles you can rely on, only practice can help you become a proper neural-network architect. The next few chapters will both teach you explicit principles for building neural networks and help you develop intuition as to what works or doesn’t work for specific problems.  3.1.3 Loss functions and optimizers: keys to configuring the learning  process Once the network architecture is defined, you still have to choose two more things:  Loss function  objective function —The quantity that will be minimized during training. It represents a measure of success for the task at hand. Optimizer—Determines how the network will be updated based on the loss function. It implements a specific variant of stochastic gradient descent  SGD .  A neural network that has multiple outputs may have multiple loss functions  one per output . But the gradient-descent process must be based on a   scalar loss value; so, for  multiloss  networks,  all  losses  are  combined   via  averaging   into  a  single  scalar quantity.  single  Choosing the right objective function for the right problem is extremely important: your  network  will  take  any  shortcut  it  can,  to  minimize  the  loss;  so  if  the  objective doesn’t fully correlate with success for the task at hand, your network will end up doing things you may not have wanted. Imagine a stupid, omnipotent AI trained via SGD, with this poorly chosen objective function: "maximizing the average well-being of all humans alive." To make its job easier, this AI might choose to kill all humans except a few and focus  on  the  well-being  on  the  remaining  ones—because  average  well-being  isn’t affected  by  how  many  humans  are  left.  That  might  not  be  what  you  intended!  Just remember that all neural networks you build will be just as ruthless in lowering their loss function—so  choose  the  objective  wisely,  or  you  will  have  to  face  unintended side-effects.  Fortunately, when it comes to common problems such as classification, regression, and sequence prediction, there are simple guidelines you can follow to choose the correct loss. For instance, you’ll use binary crossentropy for a two-class classification problem, categorical crossentropy for a many-class classification problem, mean-squared error for a  regression  problem,  CTC  for  a  sequence  learning  problem,  and  so  on.  Only  when you’re  working  on  truly  new  research  problems  will  you  have  to  develop  your  own objective functions. In the next few chapters, we’ll detail explicitly which loss functions to choose for a wide range of common tasks.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  56   3.2 Introduction to Keras  Throughout  this  book,  the  code  examples  use  Keras     .  Keras  is  a deep-learning framework that provides a convenient way to define and train almost any kind of deep-learning model. Keras was initially developed for researchers, with the aim of enabling fast experimentation.  keras.rstudio.com  Keras has the following key features:  It allows the same code to run seamlessly on CPU or GPU. It has a user-friendly API that makes it easy to quickly prototype deep-learning models. It has build-in support for convolutional networks  for computer vision , recurrent networks  for sequence processing , and any combination of both. It supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models, layer sharing, model sharing, and so on. This means Keras is appropriate for building essentially any deep-learning model, from a generative adversarial network to a neural Turing machine.  Keras and it’s R interface are is distributed under the permissive MIT license, which means it can be freely used in commercial projects. The Keras R package is compatible with R versions 3.2 and higher. The documentation for the R interface is available at  keras.rstudio.com  . The main project website can be found at   keras.io  .  Keras has well over 150,000 users, ranging from academic researchers and engineers at both startups and large companies to graduate students and hobbyists. Keras is used at Google, Netflix, Uber, CERN, Yelp, Square, and hundreds of startups working on a wide range of problems. Keras is also a popular framework on Kaggle, the machine-learning competition website, where almost every recent deep-learning competition has been won using Keras models.  Figure 3.2 Google web search interest for different deep-learning frameworks over time  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  57   3.2.1 Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK  backend engine  Keras  is  a  model-level  library,  providing  high-level  building  blocks  for  developing deep-learning models. It doesn’t handle low-level operations such as tensor manipulation and differentiation. Instead, it relies on a specialized, well-optimized tensor library to do so, serving as the   of Keras. Rather than choosing a single tensor library and tying the implementation of Keras to that library, Keras handles the problem in a modular  way   see  figure  3.3 ;  thus  several  different  backend  engines  can  be  plugged seamlessly  into  Keras.  Currently,  the  three  existing  backend  implementations  are  the TensorFlow backend, the Theano backend, and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit  CNTK  backend. In the future, it’s likely that Keras will be extended to work with even more deep-learning execution engines.  Figure 3.3 The deep-learning software and hardware stack  github.com Microsoft CNTK  deeplearning.net software theano  TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano are some of the primary platforms for deep learning    is  developed  by  the  MILA  lab  at  today.  Theano    Université de Montréal , TensorFlow  www.tensorflow.org  is developed by Google, and CNTK     is developed by Microsoft. Any piece of code that you write with Keras can be run with any of these backends without having to change anything in the code: you can seamlessly switch between the two during development, which often proves useful—for instance, if one of these backends proves to be faster for a specific task. We recommend using the TensorFlow backend as the default for most of your deep-learning needs, because it’s the most widely adopted, most scalable, and most production ready.  Via  TensorFlow   or  Theano,  or  CNTK ,  Keras  is  able  to  run  seamlessly  on  both CPUs  and  GPUs.  When  running  on  CPU,  TensorFlow  is  itself  wrapping  a  low-level library for tensor operations called Eigen    . On GPU, TensorFlow wraps a library of well-optimized deep-learning operations called the NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library  cuDNN .  eigen.tuxfamily.org  3.2.2 Installing Keras  To get started with Keras, you need to install the Keras R package, the core Keras library, as well as a backend tensor engine  e.g. TensorFlow . You can accomplish all of this as follows:  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  58   Listing 3.1 Installing Keras   Install the keras R package install.packages "keras"    Install the core Keras library + TensorFlow library keras  install_keras    This  will  provide  you  with  a  default  CPU-based  installation  of  Keras  and  TensorFlow.  As noted in the next section on setting up a deep learning workstation, you will very likely want to train your deep learning models on a GPU. If you are running on a system with an NVIDIA GPU and properly configured CUDA and cuDNN libraries then you can install the GPU-based version of the TensorFlow backend engine as follows:  Listing 3.2 Installing the GPU version of TensorFlow  install_keras tensorflow = "gpu"   Note  that  you  should  only  do  this  if  your  workstation  has  an  NVIDIA  GPU  and required software  CUDA and cuDNN , as the GPU version of TensorFlow will fail to load if these prerequisites are not met. The next section covers GPU configurations in more detail.  3.2.3 Developing with Keras: a quick overview  You’ve already seen one example of a Keras model: the MNIST example. The typical Keras workflow looks just like that example:  1. 2. 3.  4.  Define your training data: input tensors and target tensors. Define a network of layers  or  Configure the learning process by choosing a loss function, an optimizer, and some metrics to monitor. Iterate on your training data by calling the     that maps your inputs to your targets.   method of your model.  model  fit    There  are  two  ways  to  define  a  model:  using  the  keras_model_sequential   function  only for linear stacks of layers, which is the most common network architecture by far  or the    for directed acyclic graphs of layers, which lets you build completely arbitrary architectures .  functional API  As a refresher, here’s a two-layer model defined using  keras_model_sequential   note that we’re passing the expected shape of the input data to the first layer :  model  %   layer_dense units = 32, input_shape = c 784   %>%   layer_dense units = 10, activation = "softmax"   And here’s the same model defined using the functional API:  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  59   input_tensor <- layer_input shape = c 784    output_tensor  %   layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 10, activation = "softmax"   model <- keras_model inputs = input_tensor, outputs = output_tensor   With the functional API, you’re manipulating the data tensor that the model processes  and applying layers to this tensor as if they were functions.  NOTE  Note A detailed guide to what you can do with the functional API can be found in chapter 7. Until chapter 6, we’ll only be using keras_model_sequential in our code examples.  Once  your  model  architecture  is  defined,  it  doesn’t  matter  whether  you  used    or  the  functional  API.  All  of  the  following  steps  are  the  keras_model_sequential same.  The  learning  process  is  configured  in  the  compilation  step,  where  you  specify  the optimizer and loss function s  that the model should use, as well as the metrics you want to monitor during training. Here’s an example with a single loss function, which is by far the most common case:  model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop lr = 0.0001 ,   loss = "mse",   metrics = c "accuracy"     Finally,  the  learning  process  consists  of  passing  arrays  of  input  data   and  the  method, similar to what you would  fit    corresponding target data  to the model via the  do with other machine-learning libraries:  model %>% fit input_tensor, target_tensor, batch_size = 128, epochs = 10   Over the next few chapters, you’ll build a solid intuition about what type of network architectures  work  for  different  kinds  of  problems,  how  to  pick  the  right  learning configuration, and how to tweak a model until it gives the results you want to see.  We’ll  look  at  three  basic  examples  in  sections  3.4,  3.5,  and  3.6:  a  two-class classification example, a many-class classification example, and a regression example. All  the  code  examples  in  this  book  are  available  as  open  source  notebooks;  you  can download  the  www.manning.com books deep-learning-with-r  website   book’s   them   from   at   .  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  60   3.3 Setting up a deep-learning workstation  Before you can get started developing deep-learning applications, you need to set up your workstation.  It’s  highly  recommended,  although  not  strictly  necessary,  that  you  run deep-learning code on a modern NVIDIA GPU. Some applications—in particular, image processing with convolutional networks and sequence processing with recurrent neural networks—will be excruciatingly slow on CPU, even a fast multicore CPU. And even for applications that can realistically be run on CPU, you’ll generally see speed increase by a factor or 5 or 10 by using a modern GPU. If you don’t want to install a GPU on your machine, you can alternatively consider running your experiments on a AWS EC2 GPU instance  or  on  Google  Cloud  Platform.  But  note  that  that  cloud  GPU  instances  can become expensive over time.  Whether  you’re  running  locally  or  in  the  cloud,  it’s  better  to  be  using  a  Unix workstation. Although it’s technically possible to use Keras on Windows  all three Keras backends support Windows , we don’t recommend it. In the installation instructions in appendix A, we’ll consider an Ubuntu machine. If you’re a Windows user, the simplest solution to get everything running is to set up an Ubuntu dual boot on your machine. It may seem like a hassle, but using Ubuntu will save you a lot of time and a trouble in the long run.  Note that in order to use Keras, you need to install TensorFlow    Theano  or  all  of  them,  if  you  want  to  be  able  to  switch  back  and  forth  among  the  three backends . In this book, we’ll focus on TensorFlow, with some light instructions relative to Theano. We won’t cover CNTK.   CTNK   or  or  3.3.1 Getting Keras running: two options  To get started in practice, we recommend one of the following two options:  aws.amazon.com amazon-ai amis  Use the official EC2 Deep Learning AMI    , and run Keras experiments within RStudio Server on EC2. Do this if you don’t already have a GPU on your local machine. We provide a step-by-step guide in appendix B. You can find details on other cloud GPU options at  Install everything from scratch on a local Unix workstation. Do this if you already have a high-end NVIDIA GPU. We provide an Ubuntu-specific, step-by-step guide in appendix A. You can find additional details on local GPU configurations at  tensorflow.rstudio.com tools local_gpu  tensorflow.rstudio.com tools cloud_gpu .  .  Let’s take a closer look at some of the compromises involved in picking one option  over the other.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  61   3.3.2 Running deep-learning jobs in the cloud: pros and cons  If you don’t already have a GPU that you can use for deep learning  a recent, high-end NVIDIA  GPU ,  then  running  deep-learning  experiments  in  the  cloud  is  a  simple, low-cost way for you to get started without having to buy any additional hardware. If you’re using RStudio Server, the experience of running in the cloud is no different from running locally. As of mid-2017, the cloud offering that makes it easiest to get started with deep learning is definitely AWS EC2. In appendix B, we provide a step-by-step guide to running RStudio Server on a EC2 GPU instance.  But if you’re a heavy user of deep learning, this setup isn’t sustainable in the long term—or even for more than a few weeks. EC2 instances are expensive: the instance type we recommend in appendix B  the   instance, which won’t provide you with much power  costs $0.90 per hour as of mid-2017. Meanwhile, a solid consumer-class GPU will cost you somewhere between $1,000 and $1,500—a price that has been fairly stable over time, even as the specs of these GPUs keeps improving. If you’re serious about deep learning, you should set up a local workstation with one or more GPUs.  p2.xlarge  In short, EC2 is a great way to get started. You could follow the code examples in this book entirely on a EC2 GPU instance. But if you’re going to be a power user of deep learning, get your own GPUs.  3.3.3 What is the best GPU for deep learning?  If you’re going to buy a GPU, which one should you choose? The first thing to note is that it must be an NVIDIA GPU. NVIDIA is the only graphics computing company that has invested heavily in deep learning so far, and modern deep-learning frameworks can only run on NVIDIA cards.  As  of  mid-2017,  we  recommend  the  NVIDIA  TITAN  Xp  as  the  best  card  on  the market for deep learning. For lower budgets, you may want to consider the GTX 1060. If you’re  reading  these  pages  in  2018  or  later,  take  the  time  to  look  online  for  fresher recommendations, because new models come out every year.  From this section onward, we’ll assume that you have access to a machine with Keras and its dependencies installed—preferably with GPU support. Make sure you finish this step before you proceed. Go through our step-by-step guides in the appendixes, and look online if you need further help. There is no shortage of tutorials on how to install Keras and common deep-learning dependencies.  We can now dive into practical Keras examples.  3.4 Classifying movie reviews: a binary classification example  Two-class classification, or binary classification, may be the most widely applied kind of machine-learning  problem.  In  this  example,  you’ll  learn  to  classify  movie  reviews  as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  62   3.4.1 The IMDB dataset  You’ll be working with the IMDB dataset: a set of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. They’re split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting of 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.  Why  use  separate  training  and  test  sets?  Because  you  should  never  test  a machine-learning model on the same data that you used to train it! Just because a model performs well on its training data doesn’t mean it will perform well on data it has never seen; and what you care about is your model’s performance on new data  because you already know the labels of your training data—obviously you don’t need your model to predict  those .  For  instance,  it’s  possible  that  your  model  could  end  up  merely  memorizing  a mapping between your training samples and their targets, which would be useless for the task of predicting targets for data the model has never seen before. We’ll go over this point in much more detail in the next chapter.  Just like the MNIST dataset, the IMDB dataset comes packaged with Keras. It has already  been  preprocessed:  the  reviews   sequences  of  words   have  been  turned  into sequences of integers, where each integer stands for a specific word in a dictionary.  The following code will load the dataset  when you run it the first time, about 80 MB  of data will be downloaded to your machine .

Reverses it, mapping integer indices to words Decodes the review. Note that the indices are offset by 3 because 0, 1, and 2 are reserved indices for "padding", "start of sequence", and "unknown".  3.4.2 Preparing the data  You can’t feed lists of integers into a neural network. You have to turn your lists into tensors. There are two ways to do that:   samples, word_indices   Pad your lists so that they all have the same length, turn them into an integer tensor of shape , and then use as the first layer in your network a layer capable of handling such integer tensors  the "embedding" layer, which we’ll cover in detail later in the book . One-hot-encode your lists to turn them into vectors of 0s and 1s. This would mean, for instance, turning the sequence  zeros except for indices 3 and 5, which would be ones. Then you could use as the first layer in your network a dense layer, capable of handling floating-point vector data.   into a 10,000-dimensional vector that would be all  [3, 5]  Let’s go with the latter solution and vectorize the data, which you’ll do manually for  maximum clarity.

A  type  of  network  that  performs  well  on  such  a  problem  is  a simple  stack  of  fully  connected   "dense"     activations:  layer_dense units = 16, activation = "relu"   layers  with   relu  .  The argument being passed to each dense layer  16  is the number of hidden units of  is a dimension in the representation space of the layer. You may  activation implements  the layer. A  remember from chapter 2 that each such dense layer with a  the following chain of tensor operations:  hidden unit  relu  output = relu dot W, input  + b   Having  16  hidden  units  means  the  weight  matrix     will  have  shape   will project the input data onto  input_dimension, 16   and apply a 16-dimensional representation space  and then you’ll add the bias vector  the    operation .  You  can  intuitively  understand  the  dimensionality  of  your representation space as "how much freedom you’re allowing the network to have when  : that is, the dot product with   relu  b  W  W  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  65   learning  internal  representations."  Having  more  hidden  units   a  higher-dimensional representation space  allows your network to learn more complex representations, but it makes the network more computationally expensive and may lead to learning unwanted patterns  patterns that will improve performance on the training data but not on the test data .  There are two key architecture decisions to be made about such stack of dense layers:  How many layers to use How many hidden units to choose for each layer  In chapter 4, you’ll learn formal principles to guide you in making these choices. For  the time being, you’ll have to trust us with the following architecture choice:  Two intermediate layers with 16 hidden units each A third layer that will output the scalar prediction regarding the sentiment of the current review  relu  The intermediate layers will use    as their activation function, and the final layer will  use  a  sigmoid  activation  so  as  to  output  a  probability   a  score  between  0  and  1, indicating how likely the sample is to have the target "1": that is, how likely the review is to be positive . A    rectified linear unit  is a function meant to zero-out negative values  see figure 3.4 , whereas a sigmoid "squashes" arbitrary values into the  [0, 1] interval  see figure 3.5 , outputting something that can be interpreted as a probability.  relu  Figure 3.4 The rectified linear unit function  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  66   Figure 3.5 The sigmoid function  Figure 3.6 show what the network looks like.

Without  an  activation  function  like   ,  the dense  layer  would  consist  of  two  linear  operations—a  dot  product  and  an addition:     also  called  a   non-linearity  relu  output = dot W, input  + b  linear transformations hypothesis space    affine transformations  So the layer could only learn  of the input data: that is, the   of the layer would be the set of all possible linear transformations of the input data into a 16-dimensional space. Such a hypothesis space is too restricted and wouldn’t benefit from multiple  layers  of  representations,  because  a  deep  stack  of  linear  layers would still implement a linear operation: adding more layers wouldn’t extend the hypothesis space. In order to get access to a much richer hypothesis space that would benefit from deep representations, you need a non-linearity, or activation function.   is the most popular activation function in deep learning, but there are relu ,  many other candidates, which all come with similarly strange names:  prelu elu  , and so on.  Finally, you need to choose a loss function and an optimizer. Because you’re facing a binary classification problem and the output of your network is a probability  you end your network with a single-unit layer with a sigmoid activation , it’s best to use the   loss. It isn’t the only viable choice: you could use, for instance,  binary_crossentropy . But crossentropy is usually the best choice when you’re dealing mean_squared_error with  models  that  output  probabilities.    is  a  quantity  from  the  field  of Information Theory that measures the distance between probability distributions or, in this case, between the ground-truth distribution and your predictions. rmsprop  Here’s the step where you configure the model with the    optimizer and the    loss  function.  Note  that  you’ll  also  monitor  accuracy  during  Crossentropy  binary_crossentropy training.  Listing 3.7 Compiling the model  model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "accuracy"     rmsprop binary_crossentropy  You’re passing your optimizer, loss function, and metrics as strings, which is possible because   are packaged as part of Keras. Sometimes you may want to configure the parameters of your optimizer or pass a custom loss  function  or  metric  function.  The  former  can  be  done  by  passing  an  optimizer  accuracy  , and   ,   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  68   instance as the  passing function objects as the   optimizer   argument, as shown in listing 3.8; the latter can be done by  loss   and or   metrics   arguments, as shown in listing 3.9.  3.4.4 Validating your approach  In order to monitor during training the accuracy of the model on data it has never seen before, you’ll create a validation set by setting apart 10,000 samples from the original training data.   and   You’ll  now  train  the  model  for  20  epochs   20  iterations  over  all  samples  in  the   tensors , in mini-batches of 512 samples. At the same time, you’ll x_train monitor loss and accuracy on the 10,000 samples that you set apart. You do so by passing the validation data as the   validation_data   argument.  y_train  Listing 3.8 Configuring the optimizer  model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop lr=0.001 ,   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "accuracy"     Listing 3.9 Using custom losses and metrics  model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop lr = 0.001 ,   loss = loss_binary_crossentropy,   metrics = metric_binary_accuracy    Listing 3.10 Setting aside a validation set  val_indices <- 1:10000  x_val <- x_train[val_indices,] partial_x_train <- x_train[-val_indices,]  y_val <- y_train[val_indices] partial_y_train <- y_train[-val_indices]  Listing 3.11 Training your model  model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "accuracy"     history  % fit    partial_x_train,   partial_y_train,   epochs = 20,   batch_size = 512,   validation_data = list x_val, y_val     Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  69   On  a  CPU,  this  will  take  less  than  2  seconds  per  epoch—training  is  over  in  20 seconds. At the end of every epoch, there is a slight pause as the model computes its loss and accuracy on the 10,000 samples of the validation data.  Note that the call to   fit     returns a   history   object. Let’s take a look at it:  Listing 3.12 The   history   object  > str history  List of 2  $ params :List of 8   ..$ metrics           : chr [1:4] "loss" "acc" "val_loss" "val_acc"   ..$ epochs            : int 20   ..$ steps             : NULL   ..$ do_validation     : logi TRUE   ..$ samples           : int 15000   ..$ batch_size        : int 512   ..$ verbose           : int 1   ..$ validation_samples: int 10000  $ metrics:List of 4   ..$ acc     : num [1:20] 0.783 0.896 0.925 0.941 0.952 ...   ..$ loss    : num [1:20] 0.532 0.331 0.24 0.186 0.153 ...   ..$ val_acc : num [1:20] 0.832 0.882 0.886 0.888 0.888 ...   ..$ val_loss: num [1:20] 0.432 0.323 0.292 0.278 0.278 ...  - attr *, "class" = chr "keras_training_history"  The   history  history$params  history$metrics    object  includes  various  parameters  used  to  fit  the  model       as  well  as  data  for  each  of  the  metrics  being  monitored     .  The   history   object has a   plot     method that enables us to visualize the training and  validation metrics by epoch:  Listing 3.13 Plotting the training and validation metrics  plot history   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  70   Figure 3.7 Training and validation metrics  The accuracy is plotted on the top panel and the loss on the bottom panel.

You can customize all of this behavior via various arguments to the plot method.  ggplot2  If  you  want  to  create  a  custom  visualization  you  can  call  the    method  on  the  history  to  obtain  a  data  frame  with  as.data.frame   factors for each metric as well as training vs. validation:  > history_df <- as.data.frame history  > str history_df  'data.frame':   120 obs. of  4 variables:  $ epoch : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...  $ value : num  0.87 0.941 0.954 0.962 0.965 ...  $ metric: Factor w  2 levels "acc","loss": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...  $ data  : Factor w  2 levels "training","validation": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...  As  you  can  see,  the  training  loss  decreases  with  every  epoch,  and  the  training accuracy  increases  with  every  epoch.  That’s  what  you  would  expect  when  running  a gradient-descent  optimization—the  quantity  you’re  trying  to  minimize  should  be  less with every iteration. But that isn’t the case for the validation loss and accuracy: they seem to peak at the fourth epoch. This is an example of what we warned against earlier: a  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  71   model  that  performs  better  on  the  training  data  isn’t  necessarily  a  model  that  will  do overfitting better on data it has never seen before. In precise terms, what you’re seeing is  : after  the  second  epoch,  you’re  over-optimizing  on  the  training  data,  and  you  end  up learning representations that are specific to the training data and don’t generalize to data outside of the training set.  In  this  case,  to  prevent  overfitting,  you  could  stop  training  after  three  epochs.  In general, you can use a range of techniques to mitigate overfitting, which we’ll cover in chapter 4.  Let’s train a new network from scratch for four epochs and then evaluate it on the test  data.  Listing 3.14 Retraining a model from scratch  model  %   layer_dense units = 16, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 10000   %>%   layer_dense units = 16, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "accuracy"     model %>% fit x_train, y_train, epochs = 4, batch_size = 512  results  % evaluate x_test, y_test   The final results are as follows:  > results $loss [1] 0.2900235  $acc [1] 0.88512  This  fairly  naive  approach  achieves  an  accuracy  of  88%.  With  state-of-the-art  approaches, you should be able to get close to 95%.  3.4.5 Using a trained network to generate predictions on new data  After  having  trained  a  network,  you’ll  want  to  use  it  in  a  practical  setting.  You  can generate the likelihood of reviews being positive by using the    method:  predict  > model %>% predict x_test[1:10,]   [1,] 0.92306918  [2,] 0.84061098  [3,] 0.99952853  [4,] 0.67913240  [5,] 0.73874789  [6,] 0.23108074  [7,] 0.01230567  [8,] 0.04898361  [9,] 0.99017477 [10,] 0.72034937  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  72   As you can see, the network is confident for some samples  0.99 or more, or 0.01 or  less  but less confident for others  0.7, 0.2 .  3.4.6 Further experiments  The following experiments will help convince you that the architecture choices you’ve made are all fairly reasonable, although they can still be improved:  You used two hidden layers. Try using one or three hidden layers, and see how doing so affects validation and test accuracy. Try using layers with more hidden units or fewer hidden units: 32 units, 64 units, and so on.

But what happens when you have more than two classes?  In this section, you’ll build a network to classify Reuters newswires into 46 different mutually exclusive topics. Because you have many classes, this problem is an instance of  multiclass classification ; and because each data point should be classified into only one category,  the  problem  is  more  specifically  an  instance  of  single-label,  multiclass classification .

It’s  a  simple,  widely  used  toy  dataset  for  text classification.  There  are  46  different  topics;  some  topics  are  more  represented  than others, but each topic has at least 10 examples in the training set.  Like IMDB and MNIST, the Reuters dataset comes packaged as part of Keras. Let’s  take a look.  library keras   Listing 3.15 Loading the Reuters dataset  reuters <- dataset_reuters num_words = 10000  c c train_data, train_labels , c test_data, test_labels   %<-% reuters  As with the IMDB dataset, the argument   num_words = 10000   restricts the data to the  10,000 most frequently occurring words found in the data.

Listing 3.17 Encoding the data  vectorize_sequences <- function sequences, dimension = 10000  {   results <- matrix 0, nrow = length sequences , ncol = dimension    for  i in 1:length sequences       results[i, sequences[[i]]] <- 1   results }  x_train <- vectorize_sequences train_data  x_test <- vectorize_sequences test_data   To vectorize the labels, there are two possibilities: you can cast the label list as an one-hot  encoding. One-hot encoding is a widely used integer tensor, or you can use a  format  for  categorical  data,  also  called  .  For  a  more  detailed explanation of one-hot encoding, see section 6.1. In this case, one-hot encoding of the labels consists of embedding each label as an all-zero vector with a 1 in the place of the label index. Here’s an example:  categorical  encoding  to_one_hot <- function labels, dimension = 46  {   results <- matrix 0, nrow = length labels , ncol = dimension    for  i in 1:length labels       results[i, labels[[i]]] <- 1   results }  one_hot_train_labels <- to_one_hot train_labels  one_hot_test_labels <- to_one_hot test_labels   Note that there is a built-in way to do this in Keras, which you’ve already seen in  action in the MNIST example:  one_hot_train_labels <- to_categorical train_labels  one_hot_test_labels <- to_categorical test_labels   3.5.3 Building your network  This  topic-classification  problem  looks  similar  to  the  previous  movie-review classification problem: in both cases, you’re trying to classify short snippets of text. But there is a new constraint here: the number of output classes has gone from 2 to 46. The dimensionality of the output space is much larger.  In a stack of dense layers like that you’ve been using, each layer can only access information  present  in  the  output  of  the  previous  layer.  If  one  layer  drops  some information  relevant  to  the  classification  problem,  this  information  can  never  be recovered by later layers: each layer can potentially become an information bottleneck. In  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  75   the previous example, you used 16-dimensional intermediate layers, but a 16-dimensional space may be too limited to learn to separate 46 different classes: such small layers may act as information bottlenecks, permanently dropping relevant information.  For this reason you’ll use larger layers. Let’s go with 64 units.  Listing 3.18 Model definition  model  %   layer_dense units = 64, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 10000   %>%   layer_dense units = 64, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 46, activation = "softmax"   There are two other things you should note about this architecture:  You end the network with a dense layer of size 46. This means for each input sample, the network will output a 46-dimensional vector. Each entry in this vector  each dimension  will encode a different output class. The last layer uses a  means the network will output a  classes: that is, for every input sample, the network will produce a 46-dimensional output vector, where  . The 46 scores will sum to 1.   activation. You saw this pattern in the MNIST example. It   is the probability that the sample belongs to class    over the 46 different output  probability distribution  softmax  output  i  The  best  loss  function  to  use  in  this  case  is   .  It measures  the  distance  between  two  probability  distributions:  here,  between  the probability distribution output by the network and the true distribution of the labels. By minimizing the distance between these two distributions, you train the network to output something as close as possible to the true labels.  categorical_crossentropy  3.5.4 Validating your approach  Let’s set apart 1,000 samples in the training data to use as a validation set.

The  only  thing  this  approach  would  change  is  the  choice  of  the  loss function. The previous loss,  , expects the labels to follow a categorical  sparse_categorical_crossentropy  categorical_crossentropy labels,   encoding.

Now let’s see what happens when  you  introduce  an  information  bottleneck  by  having  intermediate  layers  that  are significantly less than 46-dimensional: for example, 4-dimensional.  Listing 3.25 A model with an information bottleneck  model  %   layer_dense units = 64, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 10000   %>%   layer_dense units = 4, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 46, activation = "softmax"   model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "categorical_crossentropy",   metrics = c "accuracy"     model %>% fit    partial_x_train,   partial_y_train,   epochs = 20,   batch_size = 128,   validation_data = list x_val, y_val     The network now peaks at ~71% validation accuracy, an 8% absolute drop. This drop is  mostly  due  to  the  fact  that  you’re  trying  to  compress  a  lot  of  information   enough information  to  recover  the  separation  hyperplanes  of  46  classes   into  an  intermediate most space that is too low-dimensional. The network is able to cram   of the necessary information into these eight-dimensional representations, but not all of it.

Now try using a single hidden layer, or three hidden layers.  3.5.9 Wrapping up  Here’s what you should take away from this example:  N  .N   classes, your network should end with a   activation so that it will output a probability distribution over the   If you’re trying to classify data points among  dense layer of size  In a single-label, multiclass classification problem, your network should end with a   output softmax classes.

Another  common  type  of machine-learning problem is  , which consists of predicting a continuous value instead  of  a  discrete  label:  for  instance,  predicting  the  temperature  tomorrow,  given meteorological data; or predicting the time that a software project will take to complete, given its specifications.  regression  NOTE  Note Don’t  confuse  . logistic  regression Confusingly,  logistic  regression  isn’t  a  regression  algorithm—it’s  a classification algorithm.  the  algorithm   regression    and   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  80   3.6.1 The Boston Housing Price dataset  You’ll be attempting to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given data points about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local  property  tax  rate,  and  so  on.  The  dataset  you’ll  be  using  has  an  interesting difference from the two previous examples. It has relatively few data points: only 506, split between 404 training samples and 102 test samples. And each   in the input data  for example, the crime rate  has a different scale. For instance, some values are proportions, which take a values between 0 and 1; others take values between 1 and 12, others between 0 and 100, and so on.  feature  Listing 3.26 Loading the Boston housing dataset  library keras   dataset <- dataset_boston_housing   c c train_data, train_targets , c test_data, test_targets   %<-% dataset  Let’s look at the data:  > str train_data   num [1:404, 1:13] 1.2325 0.0218 4.8982 0.0396 3.6931 ... > str test_data   num [1:102, 1:13] 18.0846 0.1233 0.055 1.2735 0.0715 ...  As you can see, you have 404 training samples and 102 test samples, each with 13 numerical features, such as per capita crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, accessibility to highways, and so on.  The targets are the median values of owner-occupied homes, in thousands of dollars:  > str train_targets  num [1:404 1d ] 15.2 42.3 50 21.1 17.7 18.5 11.3 15.6 15.6 14.4 ...  The  prices  are  typically  between  $10,000  and  $50,000.  If  that  sounds  cheap,  remember that this was the mid-1970s, and these prices aren’t adjusted for inflation.  3.6.2 Preparing the data  It would be problematic to feed into a neural network values that all take wildly different ranges. The network might be able to automatically adapt to such heterogeneous data, but it would definitely make learning more difficult. A widespread best practice to deal with such data is to do feature-wise normalization: for each feature in the input data  a column in the input data matrix , you subtract the mean of the feature and divide by the standard deviation, so that the feature is centered around 0 and has a unit standard deviation. This is easily done in R using the    function.  scale    Listing 3.27 Normalizing the data  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  81   mean <- apply train_data, 2, mean  std <- apply train_data, 2, sd   train_data <- scale train_data, center = mean, scale = std  test_data <- scale test_data, center = mean, scale = std   Calculate the mean and sd on the training data Scale training and test data using the mean and sd from the training data  Note that the quantities used for normalizing the test data are computed using the training data. You should never use in your workflow any quantity computed on the test data, even for something as simple as data normalization.  3.6.3 Building your network  Because so few samples are available, you’ll use a very small network with 2 hidden layers,  each  with  64  units.  In  general,  the  less  training  data  you  have,  the  worse overfitting will be, and using a small network is one way to mitigate overfitting.  Listing 3.28 Model definition  build_model <- function   {   model  %     layer_dense units = 64, activation = "relu",                 input_shape = dim train_data [[2]]  %>%     layer_dense units = 64, activation = "relu"  %>%     layer_dense units = 1     model %>% compile      optimizer = "rmsprop",     loss = "mse",     metrics = c "mae"      }  Because you’ll need to instantiate the same model multiple times, you use a function to construct it.  The network ends with a single unit and no activation  it will be a linear layer . This is  a  typical  setup  for  scalar  regression   a  regression  where  you’re  trying  to  predict  a single continuous value . Applying an activation function would constrain the range the output can take; for instance, if you applied a   activation function to the last layer, the network could only learn to predict values between 0 and 1. Here, because the last layer is purely linear, the network is free to learn to predict values in any range.  sigmoid  Note that you compile the network with the   mean squared error , the square of the difference between the predictions and the targets. This is a widely used loss function for regression problems.   loss function—  mse  You’re also monitoring a new metric during training:     MAE . It’s  the  absolute  value  of  the  difference  between  the  predictions  and  the  targets.

But  because  you  have  so  few  data  points,  the validation set would end up being very small  for example, about 100 examples . As a consequence, the validation scores might change a lot depending on which data points you chose to use for validation and which you chose for training: that is, the validation scores might have a high   with regard to the validation split. This would prevent you from reliably evaluating your model.  variance   cross-validation  see figure 3.9 . It The best practice in such situations is to use    =  4  or  5 , consists  of  splitting  the  available  data  into  instantiating    –  1  partitions  while evaluating on the remaining partition. The validation score for the model used is then the average of the    validation scores obtained.

The average  2.4  is a much more reliable metric than any single score—that’s the entire point of K-fold cross-validation. In this case, you’re off by $2,400 on average, which is significant considering that the prices range from $10,000 to $50,000.  Let’s try training the network a bit longer: 500 epochs. To keep a record of how well the  model  does  at  each  epoch,  you’ll  modify  the  training  loop  to  save  the  per-epoch validation score log.

Past that point, you start overfitting.

Mean squared error  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  86   3.7 Summary   MSE  is a commonly used loss function for regression. Similarly, evaluation metrics to be used for regression differ from those used for classification; naturally, the concept of accuracy doesn’t apply for regression. A common regression metric is mean absolute error  MAE . When features in the input data have values in different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently as a preprocessing step. When there is little data available, using K-fold validation is a great way to reliably evaluate a model. When little training data is available, it’s preferable to use a small network with few hidden layers  typically only one or two , in order to avoid severe overfitting.  You’re now able to handle the most common kinds of machine-learning tasks on vector data: binary classification, multiclass classification, and scalar regression. The "Wrapping up" sections earlier in the chapter summarize the important points you’ve learned regarding these types of tasks. You’ll usually need to preprocess raw data before feeding it into a neural network. When your data has features with different ranges, scale each feature independently as part of preprocessing. As training progresses, neural networks eventually begin to overfit and obtain worse results on never-before-seen data. If you don’t have much training data, use a small network with only one or two hidden layers, to avoid severe overfitting. If your data is divided into many categories, you may cause information bottlenecks if you make the intermediate layers too small. Regression uses different loss functions and different evaluation metrics than classification. When you’re working with little data, K-fold validation can help reliably evaluate your model.

This chapter will formalize some of your new intuition into a solid conceptual framework for attacking and solving  deep-learning  problems.  We’ll  consolidate  all  of  these  concepts—model evaluation, data preprocessing and feature engineering, and tackling overfitting—into a detailed seven-step workflow for tackling any machine-learning task.  4.1 Four branches of machine learning  In  our  previous  examples,  you’ve  become  familiar  with  three  specific  types  of machine-learning  problems:  binary  classification,  multiclass  classification,  and  scalar regression. All three are instances of  , where the goal is to learn the relationship between training inputs and training targets.  supervised learning  Supervised learning is just the tip of the iceberg—machine learning is a vast field with  a  complex  subfield  taxonomy.  Machine-learning  algorithms  generally  fall  four broad categories, described in the following sections.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  88   4.1.1 Supervised learning  annotations  This is by far the most common case. It consists of learning to map input data to known targets  also called   , given a set of examples  often annotated by humans . All four examples you’ve encountered in this book so far were canonical examples of supervised learning. Generally, almost all applications of deep learning that are in the spotlight these days belong in this category, such as optical character recognition, speech recognition, image classification, and language translation.  Although supervised learning mostly consists of classification and regression, there  are more exotic variants as well, including the following:  Sequence generation—For example, given a picture, predict a caption describing it. Sequence generation can sometimes be reformulated as a series of classification problems  such as repeatedly predicting a word or token in a sequence . Syntax tree prediction—For example, given a sentence, predict its decomposition into a syntax tree. Object detection—Given a picture, draw a bounding box around certain objects inside the picture. This can also be expressed as a classification problem  given many candidate bounding boxes, classify the contents of each one  or as a joint classification and regression problem, where the bounding-box coordinates are predicted via vector regression. Image segmentation—Given a picture, draw a pixel-level mask on a specific object.  4.1.2 Unsupervised learning  This branch of machine learning consists of finding interesting transformations of the input data without the help of any targets, for the purposes of data visualization, data compression, or data denoising, or to better understand the correlations present in the data at hand. Unsupervised learning is the bread and butter of data analytics, and it’s often  a  necessary  step  in  better  understanding  a  dataset  before  attempting  to  solve  a supervised-learning  problem.    are  well-known categories of unsupervised learning.  Dimensionality  reduction  clustering    and   4.1.3 Self-supervised learning  This is a specific instance of supervised learning, but it’s different enough that it deserves its  own  category.  Self-supervised  learning  without human-annotated labels—you can think of it as supervised learning without any humans in the loop. There are still labels involved  because the learning has to be supervised by something ,  but  they’re  generated  from  the  input  data,  typically  using  a  heuristic algorithm.  is  supervised   learning   autoencoders  For  instance,     are  a  well-known  instance  of  self-supervised  learning, where the generated targets are the input, unmodified. In the same way, trying to predict the next frame in a video, given past frames, or the next word in a text, given previous words, are instances of self-supervised learning   , in this case:  supervision  comes  from  future  input  data .  Note  that  the  distinction  between supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised learning can be blurry sometimes—these  temporally supervised learning  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  89   categories are more of a continuum without solid borders. Self-supervised learning can be reinterpreted as either supervised or unsupervised learning, depending on whether you pay attention to the learning mechanism or to the context of its application.  NOTE  In this book, we’ll focus specifically on supervised learning, because it’s by  far  the  dominant  form  of  deep  learning  today,  with  a  wide  range  of industry  applications.  We’ll  also  take  a  briefer  look  at  self-supervised learning in later chapters.  4.1.4 Reinforcement learning  Long overlooked, this branch of machine learning recently started to get a lot of attention after Google DeepMind successfully applied it to learning to play Atari games  and, later, to learning to play Go at the highest level . In reinforcement learning, an   receives information about its environment and learns to choose actions that will maximize some reward. For instance, a neural network that "looks" at a video-game screen and outputs game actions in order to maximize its score can be trained via reinforcement learning.  agent  Currently,  reinforcement  learning  is  mostly  a  research  area  and  hasn’t  yet  had significant  practical  successes  beyond  games.  In  time,  however,  we  expect  to  see reinforcement learning take over an increasingly large range of real-world applications: self-driving  cars,  robotics,  resource  management,  education,  and  so  on.  It’s  an  idea whose time has come, or will come soon.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  90   SIDEBAR  Classification and regression glossary Classification and regression involve many specialized terms. You’ve come across  some  of  them  in  earlier  examples,  and  you’ll  see  more  of  them  in future  chapters.  They  have  precise,  machine-learning-specific  definitions, and you should be familiar with them:  input  output  —What comes out of your model.  —One data point that goes into your model.  Sample or  Prediction or  Target—The truth. What your model should ideally have predicted, according to an external source of data. Prediction error or  loss value model’s prediction and the target. Classes—A set of possible labels to choose from in a classification problem. For example, when classifying cat and dog pictures, "dog" and "cat" are the two classes. Label—A specific instance of a class annotation in a classification problem. For instance, if picture 1234 is annotated as containing the class "dog", then "dog" is a label of picture 1234.  —A measure of the distance between your  Ground-truth or  humans.  annotations  —All targets for a dataset, typically collected by  Binary classification—A classification task where each input sample should be categorized into two exclusive categories. Multiclass classification—A classification task where each input sample should be categorized into more than two categories: for instance, classifying handwritten digits. Multilabel classification—A classification task where each input sample can be assigned multiple labels. For instance, a given image may contain both a cat and a dog and should be annotated both with the "cat" label and the "dog" label. The number of labels per image is usually variable. Scalar regression—A task where the target is a continuous scalar value. Predicint house prices is a good example: the different target prices form a continuous space. Vector regression—A task where the target is a set of continuous values: for example, a continuous vector. If you’re doing regression against multiple values  such as the coordinates of a bounding box in an image , then you’re doing vector regression. Mini-batch or  —A small set of samples  typically between 8 and 128  that are processed simultaneously by the model. The number of samples is often a power of 2, to facilitate memory allocation on a GPU. When training, a mini-batch is used to compute a single gradient-descent update applied to the weights of the model.  batch  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  91   4.2 Evaluating machine-learning models  In  the  three  examples  presented  in  chapter  3,  we  split  the  data  into  a  training  set,  a validation set, and a test set.

The  following  sections  look  at  strategies  for mitigating overfitting and maximizing generalization. In this section, we’ll focus on how to measure generalization: that is, how to evaluate machine-learning models.  generalize  4.2.1 Training, validation, and test sets  Evaluating  a  model  always  boils  down  to  splitting  the  available  data  into  three  sets: training, validation, and test. You train on the training data and evaluate your model on the validation data. Once your model is ready for prime time, you test it one final time on the test data.  You may ask, why not have two sets: a training set and a test set? You’d train on the  training data and evaluate on the test data. Much simpler!   of the model, to distinguish them from the   The reason is that developing a model always involves tuning its configuration: for example,  choosing  the  number  of  layers  or  the  size  of  the  layers   called  the  hyperparameters , which are the network’s weights . You’ll do this tuning by using as a feedback signal the performance of the model on the validation data. In essence, this tuning is a form of  : a search for a good configuration in some parameter space. As a result, tuning the configuration of the model based on its performance on the validation set can quickly result in overfitting to the validation set  , even though your model is never being directly trained on it.  parameters  learning  information leaks  Central to this phenomenon is the notion of   . Every time you tune a hyperparameter of your model based on the model’s performance on the validation set, some information about the validation data leaks into the model. If you do this only once, for one parameter, then very few bits of information will leak, and your validation set will remain reliable to evaluate the model. But if you repeat this many times—running one  experiment,  evaluating  on  the  validation  set,  and  modifying  your  model  as  a result—then  you’ll  leak  an  increasingly  significant  amount  of  information  about  the validation set into the model.  At the end of the day, you’ll end up with a model that performs artificially well on the validation data, because that’s what you optimized it for. You care about performance on completely new data, not the validation data, so you need to use a completely different, never-before-seen dataset to evaluate the model: the test dataset. Your model shouldn’t  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  92   any  have had access to   information about the test set, even indirectly. If anything about the  model  has  been  tuned  based  on  test-set  performance,  then  your  measure  of generalization will be flawed.  Splitting your data into training, validation, and test sets may seem straightforward, but there are a few advanced ways to do it that can come in handy when little data is available.  Let’s  review  three  classic  evaluation  recipes:  simple  hold-out  validation, K-fold validation, and iterated K-fold validation with shuffling.  SIMPLE HOLD-OUT VALIDATION Set apart some fraction of your data as your test set. Train on the remaining data, and evaluate  on  the  test  set.  As  you  saw  in  the  previous  sections,  in  order  to  prevent information leaks, you shouldn’t tune your model based on the test set, and therefore you should   reserve a validation set.  also  Schematically, hold-out validation looks like figure 4.1. The following listing shows a  simple implementation.  Figure 4.1 Simple hold-out validation split  Listing 4.1 Hold-out validation  indices <- sample 1:nrow data , size = 0.80 * nrow data    evaluation_data  <- data[-indices, ]  training_data <- data[indices, ]  model <- get_model   model %>% train training_data  validation_score  % evaluate validation_data   model <- get_model    model %>% train data  test_score  % evaluate test_data   Shuffling the data is usually appropriate. Defines the validation set Defines the training set  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  93   Trains a model on the training data, and evaluates it on the validation data Once you’ve tuned your hyperparameters, it’s common to train your final model from scratch on all non-test data available.  This is the simplest evaluation protocol, and it suffers from one flaw: if little data is available,  then  your  validation  and  test  sets  may  contain  too  few  samples  to  be statistically  representative  of  the  data  at  hand.  This  is  easy  to  recognize:  if  different random  shuffling  rounds  of  the  data  before  splitting  end  up  yielding  very  different neasures  of  model  performance,  then  you’re  having  this  issue.  K-fold  validation  and iterated K-fold validation are two ways to address this, as discussed next.  K-FOLD VALIDATION With this approach, you split your data into   partitions of equal size. For each partition  K . Your , train a model on the remaining  i  scores obtained. This method is helpful when the final score is then the averages of the  performance of your model shows significant variance based on your train-test split. Like hold-out validation, this method doesn’t exempt you from using a distinct validation set for model calibration.   – 1 partitions, and evaluate it on partition  K  K  i  Schematically, K-fold cross-validation looks like this figure 4.2. Here’s a simple R  pseudo-code implementation.

Creates a brand-new instance of the model  untrained  Validation score: average of the validation scores of the k folds Trains the final model on all non-test data available  ITERATED K-FOLD VALIDATION WITH SHUFFLING This one is for situations in which you have relatively little data available and you need to evaluate your model as precisely as possible. We’ve found it to be extremely helpful in Kaggle competitions. It consists of applying K-fold validation multiple times, shuffling the data every time before splitting it   ways. The final score is the average of the scores obtained at each run of K-fold validation. Note that you end up training and evaluating P *  models  where    is the number of iterations you use , which can very expensive.  K  K  P  4.2.2 Things to keep in mind  Keep an eye out for the following when you’re choosing an evaluation protocol:  Data representativeness—You want both your training set and test set to be representative of the data at hand. For instance, if you’re trying to classify images of digits, and you’re starting from an array of samples where the samples are ordered by their class, taking the first 80% of the array as your training set and the remaining 20% as your test will result in your training set containing only classes 0–7, whereas your test set contains only classes 8–9. This seems like a ridiculous mistake, but it’s surprisingly common. For this reason, you usually should  it into training and test sets. The arrow of time—If you’re trying to predict the future given the past  for example, the weather tomorrow, stock movements, and so on , you should   randomly shuffle your data before splitting it, because doing so will create a  effectively be trained on data from the future. In such situations, you should always make sure all data in your test set is  Redundancy in your data—If some data points in your data appear twice  fairly common with real-world data , then shuffling the data and splitting it into a training set and a validation set will result in redundancy between the training and validation sets. In effect, you’ll be testing on part of your training data, which is the worst thing you can do!

Many  data-preprocessing  and feature-engineering techniques are domain specific  for example, specific to text data or image  data ;  we’ll  cover  those  in  the  following  chapters  as  we  encounter  them  in practical  examples.  For  now,  we’ll  review  the  basics  that  are  common  to  all  data domains.  4.3.1 Data preprocessing for neural networks  Data  preprocessing  aims  at  making  the  raw  data  at  hand  more  amenable  to  neural networks.  This  includes  vectorization,  normalization,  handling  missing  values,  and feature extraction.  VECTORIZATION All inputs and targets in a neural network must be tensors of floating-point data  or, in specific cases, tensors of integers . Whatever data you need to process—sound, images, text—you must first turn into tensors, a step called  . For instance, in the two  previous  text-classification  examples,  we  started  from  text  represented  as  lists  of integers  standing for sequences of words , and we used   to turn them into a tensor of floating point data. In the examples of classifying digits and predicting house prices, the data already came in vectorized form, so you were able to skip this step.  data vectorization  one-hot encoding  VALUE NORMALIZATION In the digit-classification example, you started from image data encoded as integers in the 0–255 range, encoding grayscale values. Before you fed this data into your network, you had  to  divide  by  255  so  you’d  end  up  with  floating-point  values  in  the  0–1  range. Similarly, when predicting house prices, you started from features that took a variety of ranges—some  features  had  small  floating-point  values,  others  had  fairly  large  integer values. Before you fed this data into your network, you had to normalize each feature independently so that it had a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0.  In general, it isn’t safe to feed into a neural network data that takes relatively large values  for example, multidigit integers, which are much larger than the initial values taken by the weights of a network  or data that is heterogeneous  for example, data where one feature is in the range 0–1 and another is in the range 100–200 . Doing so can trigger large gradient updates that will prevent the network from converging. To make learning easier for your network, your data should have the following characteristics:  Take small values—Typically, most values should be in the 0–1 range. Be homogenous—That is, all features should take values in roughly the same range.  Additionally, the following stricter normalization practice is common and can help, although  it  isn’t  always  necessary   for  example,  you  didn’t  do  this  in  the digit-classification example :  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  96   Normalize each feature independently to have a mean of 0. Normalize each feature independently to have a standard deviation of 1.  This is easy to do with R using the   scale     function:  Listing 4.3 Feature-wise normalization of 2D arrays  x <- scale x   Assuming x is a 2D matrix of shape  samples, features   Typically you’ll be normalizing features in both training and test data. In this case you’ll want to compute the mean and standard deviation on the training data only and then apply it to both the training and test data. This is what we did in chapter 3 when normalizing features in the Boston housing dataset:  Listing 4.4 Normalizing training and test data  mean <- apply train_data, 2, mean  std <- apply train_data, 2, sd   train_data <- scale train_data, center = mean, scale = std  test_data <- scale test_data, center = mean, scale = std   Calculate the mean and sd on the training data Scale training and test data using the mean and sd from the training data  The   caret   and   recipes   R packages both include many more high-level functions for  data preprocessing and normalization.  HANDLING MISSING VALUES You may sometimes have missing values in your data. For instance, in the house-price example, the first feature  the column of index 0 in the data  was the per capita crime rate.  What  if  this  feature  wasn’t  available  for  all  samples?  You’d  then  have  missing values in the training or test data.  In  general,  with  neural  networks,  it’s  safe  to  input  missing  values  as  0,  with  the condition that 0 isn’t already a meaningful value. The network will learn from exposure to the data that the value 0 means    and will start ignoring the value.  missing data  Note that if you’re expecting missing values in the test data, but the network was trained on data without any missing values, the network won’t have learned to ignore missing values! In this situation, you should artificially generate training samples with missing entries: copy some training samples several times, and drop some of the features that you expect are likely to be missing in the test data.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  97   4.3.2 Feature engineering  Feature  engineering  is  the  process  of  using  your  own  knowledge  about  the  data  and about the machine-learning algorithm at hand  in this case, a neural network  to make the algorithm work better by applying hard-coded  nonlearned  transformations to the data before  it  goes  into  the  model.  In  many  cases,  it  isn’t  reasonable  to  expect  a machine-learning  model  to  be  able  to  learn  from  completely  arbitrary  data.  The  data needs to be presented to the model in a way that will make the model’s job easier.  Let’s look at an intuitive example. Suppose you’re trying to develop a model that can  take as input an image of a clock and can output the time of day  see figure 4.3 .  Figure 4.3 Feature engineering for reading the time on a clock  If  you  choose  to  use  the  raw  pixels  of  the  image  as  input  data,  then  you  have  a difficult machine-learning problem on your hands. You’ll need a convolutional neural network to solve it, and you’ll have to expend quite a bit of computational resources to train the network.  But  if  you  already  understand  the  problem  at  a  high  level   you  understand  how humans read time on a clock face , then you can come up with much better input features for a machine-learning algorithm: for instance, it’s easy to write a short R script to follow the black pixels of the clock hands and output the  x, y  coordinates of the tip of each hand. Then a simple machine-learning algorithm can learn to associate these coordinates with the appropriate time of the day.  You can go even further: do a coordinate change, and express the  x, y  coordinates as polar coordinates with regard to the center of the image. Your input will become the angle   of each clock hand. At this point, your features are making the problem so easy that no machine learning is required; a simple rounding operation and dictionary lookup are enough to recover the approximate time of day.  theta  That’s the essence of feature engineering: making a problem easier by expressing it in  a simpler way. It usually requires understanding the problem in depth.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  98   Before  deep  learning,  feature  engineering  used  to  be  critical,  because  classical shallow algorithms didn’t have hypothesis spaces rich enough to learn useful features by themselves. The way you presented the data to the algorithm was essential to its success. For  instance,  before  convolutional  neural  networks  became  successful  on  the  MNIST digit-classification problem, solutions were typically based on hard-coded features such as the number of loops in a digit image, the height of each digit in an image, a histogram of pixel values, and so on.  Fortunately, modern deep learning removes the need for most feature engineering, because neural networks are capable of automatically extracting useful features from raw data. Does this mean you don’t have to worry about feature engineering as long as you’re using deep neural networks? No, for two reasons:  Good features still allow you to solve problems more elegantly while using fewer resources. For instance, it would be ridiculous to solve the problem of reading a clock face using a convolutional neural network. Good features let you solve a problem with much less data. The ability of deep-learning models to learn features on their own relies on having lots of training data available; if you have only a few samples, then the informativeness of their features becomes critical.  4.4 Overfitting and underfitting  In  all  the  examples  in  the  previous  chapter—predicting  movie  reviews,  topic classification, and house-price regression—the performance of the model on the held-out validation data always peaked after a few epochs and then began to degrade: that is, the model  quickly  started  to    to  the  training  data.  Overfitting  happens  in  every machine-learning problem. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning.  overfit  Optimization  The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization.   refers to the process of adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data  the   , whereas  generalization  refers to how well the trained model performs on data it has never seen before.  The  goal  of  the  game  is  to  get  good  generalization,  of  course,  but  you  don’t control generalization; you can only adjust the model based on its training data.  machine learning  learning   in   under-fit  At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower the loss on training data, the lower the loss on test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be  : there is still progress to be made; the network hasn’t yet modeled all relevant patterns in the training data. But after a certain number of iterations on the training data, generalization stops improving, and validation metrics stall and then begin to degrade: the model is starting to over-fit. That is, it’s beginning to learn patterns that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.  To  prevent  a  model  from  learning  misleading  or  irrelevant  patterns  found  in  the training data,  . A model trained on more data will  naturally  generalize  better.  When  that  isn’t  possible,  the  next-best  solution  is  to  the best solution is to get more training data  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  99   4.4.1 Reducing the network’s size  modulate  the  quantity  of  information  that  your  model  is  allowed  to  store  or  to  add constraints on what information it’s allowed to store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.  The processing of fighting overfitting this way is called   . Let’s review some  of  the  most  common  regularization  techniques  and  apply  them  in  practice  to improve the movie-classification model from section 3.4.  regularization  The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model: that is, the number  of  learnable  parameters  in  the  model   which  is  determined  by  the  number  of layers  and  the  number  of  units  per  layer .  In  deep  learning,  the  number  of  learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model’s  . Intuitively, a model with more parameters has more   and therefore can easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets—a mapping without any generalization power. For instance, a model with 500,000 binary parameters could easily be made to learn the class of every digit in the MNIST training set: we’d need only 10 binary parameters for each of the 50,000 digits. But such a model would be useless  for  classifying  new  digit  samples.  Always  keep  this  in  mind:  deep-learning models  tend  to  be  good  at  fitting  to  the  training  data,  but  the  real  challenge  is generalization, not fitting.  memorization capacity  capacity  On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it won’t be able to learn this mapping as easily; thus, in order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets—precisely the type of representations we’re interested in. At the same time, keep in mind that you should use models that have enough parameters that they don’t underfit: your model shouldn’t be starved for memorization resources. There is a compromise to be found between   not enough capacity  too much capacity   and   .  Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine the right number of layers or the right size for each layer. You must evaluate an array of different architectures  on your validation set, not on your test set, of course  in order to find the correct model size for your data. The general workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few layers and parameters, and increase the size of the layers or add new layers until you see diminishing returns with regard to validation loss.  Let’s  try  this  on  the  movie-review  classification  network.  The  original  network  is  shown next.  Listing 4.5 Original model  library keras   model  %   layer_dense units = 16, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 10000   %>%   layer_dense units = 16, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  100   Now let’s try to replace it with this smaller network.  Listing 4.6 Version of the model with lower capacity  model  %   layer_dense units = 4, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 10000   %>%   layer_dense units = 4, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   Figure 4.4 shows a comparison of the validation losses of the original network and  the smaller network  remember, a lower validation loss signals a better model .  Figure 4.4 Effect of model capacity on validation loss: trying a smaller model  As you can see, the smaller network starts overfitting later than the reference network  after six epochs rather than four , and its performance degrades much more slowly once it starts overfitting.  Now,  for  kicks,  let’s  add  to  this  benchmark  a  network  that  has  much  more  capacity—far more than the problem warrants.  Listing 4.7 Version of the model with higher capacity  model  %   layer_dense units = 512, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 10000   %>%   layer_dense units = 512, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   Figure 4.5 shows how the bigger network fares compared to the reference network.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  101   Figure 4.5 Effect of model capacity on validation loss: trying a bigger model  The bigger network starts overfitting almost immediately, after just one epoch, and it  overfits much more severely. Its validation loss is also noisier.  Meanwhile, figure 4.6 shows the training losses for the two networks. As you can see, the bigger network gets its training loss near zero very quickly. The more capacity the network has, the more quickly it can model the training data  resulting in a low training loss , but the more susceptible it is to overfitting  resulting in a large difference between the training and validation loss .

This  idea  also  applies  to  the  models  learned  by  neural networks: given some training data and a network architecture, multiple sets of weight values  multiple    could explain the data. Simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones. simple model   in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy  or a model with fewer parameters, as you saw in the previous section . Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity of a network by forcing its weights to take only small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more  , and it’s done by adding  associated with having large weights. This cost to the loss function of the network a  comes in two flavors:  weight regularization  . This is called   regular  cost  A     the   L1 norm   of the weights .

Listing 4.8 Adding L2 weight regularization to the model  model  %   layer_dense units = 16, kernel_regularizer = regularizer_l2 0.001 ,               activation = "relu", input_shape = c 10000   %>%   layer_dense units = 16, kernel_regularizer = regularizer_l2 0.001 ,               activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   regularizer_l2 0.001  means every coefficient in the weight matrix of the layer  to the total loss of the network. Note , the loss for this network will be  0.001 * weight_coefficient_value  only added at training time  will add  that because this penalty is  much higher at training than at test time.  Figure 4.7 shows the impact of the L2 regularization penalty. As you can see, the model  with  L2  regularization  has  become  much  more  resistant  to  overfitting  than  the reference model, even though both models have the same number of parameters.  Figure 4.7 Effect of L2 weight regularization on validation loss  As an alternative to L2 regularization, you can use one of the following Keras weight  regularizers.

Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly    setting to zero  a number of output features of the layer during training. Let’s say a given layer would normally return a vector [0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1] for a given input sample during training. After applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random: for example, [0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]. The   is the fraction of the features that are zeroed out; it’s usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out; instead, the layer’s output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.  dropping out  dropout rate  Consider  a  matrix  containing  the  output  of  a  layer,   ,  of  shape  . At training time, we zero out at random a fraction of the  layer_output   batch_size,  features  values in the matrix:  layer_output <- layer_output * sample 0:1, length layer_output ,                                       replace = TRUE   At test time, we scale down the output by the dropout rate. Here we scale by 0.5   because we previously dropped half the units :  layer_output <- layer_output * 0.5  Note that this process can be implemented by doing both operations at training time and leaving the output unchanged at test time, which is often the way it’s implemented in practice  see figure 4.8 :  layer_output <- layer_output * sample 0:1, length layer_output ,                                       replace = TRUE   layer_output <- layer_output   0.5  At training time Note that we’re scaling up rather scaling down in this case.  Figure 4.8 Dropout applied to an activation matrix at training time, with rescaling happening during training. At test time, the activation matrix is unchanged.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  105   This  technique  may  seem  strange  and  arbitrary.  Why  would  this  help  reduce overfitting?  Hinton  says  he  was  inspired  by,  among  other  things,  a  fraud-prevention mechanism  used  by  banks.  In  his  own  words,  "I  went  to  my  bank.  The  tellers  kept changing  and  I  asked  one  of  them  why.  He  said  he  didn’t  know  but  they  got  moved around  a  lot.  I  figured  it  must  be  because  it  would  require  cooperation  between employees  to  successfully  defraud  the  bank.  This  made  me  realize  that  randomly removing a different subset of neurons on each example would prevent conspiracies and thus reduce overfitting."  The core idea is that introducing noise in the output values of a layer can break up happenstance patterns that aren’t significant  what Hinton refers to as  conspiracies   , which the network will start memorizing if no noise is present.  7  Footnote 7mSee the Reddit thread "AMA: We are the Google Brain team. We’d love to answer your questions about machine learning,"   mng.bz XrsS  .  In  Keras,  you  can  introduce  dropout  in  a  network  via   layer_dropout  ,  which  is  applied to the output of layer right before it:  layer_dropout rate = 0.5   reducing overfitting.  Let’s  add  two  dropout  layers  in  the  IMDB  network  to  see  how  well  they  do  at  Listing 4.10 Adding dropout to the IMDB network  model  %   layer_dense units = 16, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 10000   %>%   layer_dropout rate = 0.5  %>%   layer_dense units = 16, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dropout rate = 0.5  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   Figure 4.9 shows a plot of the results.

Reduce the capacity of the network. Add weight regularization. Add dropout.  4.5 The universal workflow of machine learning  In this section, we’ll present a universal blueprint that you can use to attack and solve any machine-learning  problem.  The  discussion  ties  together  the  concepts  you’ve  learned about in this chapter: problem definition, evaluation, feature engineering, and fighting overfitting.  4.5.1 Defining the problem and assembling a dataset  First, you must define the problem at hand:  What will your input data be? What are you trying to predict? You can only learn to predict something if you have available training data: for example, you can only learn to classify the sentiment of movie reviews if you have both movie reviews and sentiment annotations available. As such, data availability is usually the limiting factor at this stage  unless you have the means to pay people to collect data for you . What type of problem are you facing? Is it binary classification? Multiclass classification? Scalar regression? Vector regression? Multiclass, multilabel classification? Something else, like clustering, generation, or reinforcement learning? Identifying the problem type will guide your choice of model architecture, loss function, and so on.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  107   You can’t move to the next stage until you know what your inputs and outputs are,  and what data you’ll be using. Be aware of the hypotheses you’re making at this stage:  You’re hypothesizing that your outputs can be predicted given your inputs. You’re hypothesizing that your available data is sufficiently informative to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs.  Until you have a working model, these are merely hypotheses, waiting to be validated or invalidated. Not all problems can be solved; just because you’ve assembled examples of inputs X and targets Y doesn’t mean X contains enough information to predict Y. For instance, if you’re trying to predict the movements of a stock on the stock market given its recent price history, you’re unlikely to succeed, because price history doesn’t contain much predictive information.  One class of unsolvable problems you should be aware of is   nonstationary problems . Suppose you’re trying to build a recommendation engine for clothing, you’re training it on one month of data  August , and you want to start generating recommendations in the winter.  One  big  issue  is  that  the  kinds  of  clothes  people  buy  change  from  season  to season: clothes buying is a nonstationary phenomenon over the scale of a few months. What  you’re  trying  to  model  changes  over  time.  In  this  case,  the  right  move  is  to constantly retrain your model on data from the recent past, or gather data at a timescale where the problem is stationary. For a cyclical problem like clothes buying, a few years' worth of data will suffice to capture seasonal variation—but remember to make the time of the year an input of your model!  Keep it in mind that machine learning can only be used to memorize patterns that are present in your training data. You can only recognize what you’ve seen before. Using machine learning trained on past data to predict the future is making the assumption that the future will behave like the past. That often isn’t the case.  To control something, you need to be able to observe it. To achieve success, you must define what you mean by success: accuracy? precision-recall? customer retention rate? Your metric for success will guide the choice of a loss function: that is, what your model will optimize. It should directly align with your higher-level goals, such as the success of your business.  For balanced-classification problems, where every class is equally likely, accuracy area  under  the  receiver  operating  characteristic  curve and     ROC  AUC   are  common metrics.  For  class-imbalanced  problems,  you  can  use  precision-recall.  For  ranking problems or multilabel classification, you can use mean average precision. And it isn’t uncommon to have to define your own custom metric by which to measure success. To get a sense of the diversity of machine-learning success metrics and how they relate to different  problem  domains,  it’s  helpful  to  browse  the  data  science  competitions  on Kaggle     ; they showcase a wide range of problems and evaluation metrics.  kaggle.com  4.5.2 Choosing a measure of success  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  108   4.5.3 Deciding on an evaluation protocol  Once you know what you’re aiming for, you must establish how you’ll measure your current progress. We’ve previously reviewed three common evaluation protocols:  Maintaining a hold-out validation set—The way to go when you have plenty of data Doing K-fold cross-validation—The right choice when you have too few samples for hold-out validation to be reliable Doing iterated K-fold validation—For performing highly accurate model evaluation when little data is available  Just pick one of these. In most cases, the first will work well enough.  4.5.4 Preparing your data  Once you know what you’re training on, what you’re optimizing for, and how to evaluate your approach, you’re almost ready to begin training models. But first, you should format your data in a way that can be fed into a machine-learning model—here we’ll assume a deep neural network:  As you saw previously, your data should be formatted as tensors. The values taken by these tensors should usually be scaled to small values: for example, in the [-1, 1] range or [0, 1] range. If different features take values in different ranges  heterogenous data , then the data should be normalized. You may want to do some feature engineering, especially for small data problems.  Once  your  tensors  of  input  data  and  target  data  are  ready,  you  can  begin  to  train  models.  4.5.5 Developing a model that does better than a baseline  : that is, to develop a small model Your goal at this stage is to achieve  that is capable of beating a dumb baseline. In the MNIST digit-classification example, anything that achieves an accuracy greater than 0.1 can be said to have statistical power; in the IMDB example, it’s anything with an accuracy greater than 0.5.  statistical power  Note  that  it’s  not  always  possible  to  achieve  statistical  power.  If  you  can’t  beat  a random baseline after trying multiple reasonable architectures, it may be that the answer to  the  question  you’re  asking  isn’t  present  in  the  input  data.  Remember  that  you’re making two hypotheses:  You’re hypothesizing that your outputs can be predicted given your inputs. You’re hypothesizing that the available data is sufficiently informative to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs.  It may well be that these hypotheses are false, in which case you must go back to the  Assuming that things go well, you need to make three key choices to build your first  drawing board.  working model:  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  109   Last-layer activation—This establishes useful constraints on the network’s output. For instance, the IMDB classification example used  example didn’t use any last-layer activation; and so on. Loss function—This should match the type of problem you’re trying to solve. For instance, the IMDB example used  mse Optimization configuration—What optimizer will you use? What will its learning rate be?

Sometimes there is no easy way to turn a metric into a loss function; loss functions, after all, need to be computable given only a mini-batch of data  ideally, a loss function should be computable for as little as  a  single  data  point   and  must  be  differentiable   otherwise  you  can’t  use backpropagation  to  train  your  network .  For  instance,  the  widely  used  classification metric  ROC  AUC  can’t  be  directly  optimized.  Hence,  in  classification  tasks,  it  is common to optimize for a proxy metric of ROC AUC, such as cross-entropy. In general, you can hope that the lower the cross-entropy gets, the higher the ROC-AUC will be.  Table 4.1 can help you choose a last-layer activation and a loss function for a few  common problem types.  m  Table 4.1 Choosing the right last-layer activation and loss function for your model Problem type Binary classification Multiclass, single-label classification Multiclass, multilabel classification Regression to arbitrary values Regression to values between 0 and 1  mse mse or binary_crossentropy  Loss function binary_crossentropy  Last-layer activation sigmoid  categorical_crossentropy  binary_crossentropy  sigmoid  softmax  sigmoid  None  4.5.6 Scaling up: developing a model that overfits  Once you’ve obtained a model that has statistical power, the question becomes, is your model powerful enough? Does it have enough layers and parameters to properly model the problem at hand? For instance, a network with a single hidden layer with two units would have statistical power on MNIST but wouldn’t be sufficient to solve the problem well. Remember that the universal tension in machine learning is between optimization and  generalization;  the  ideal  model  is  one  that  stands  right  at  the  border  between under-fitting and over-fitting; between under-capacity and over-capacity. To figure out where this border lies, first you must cross it.  To figure out how big a model you’ll need, you must develop a model that overfits.  This is fairly easy:  1. 2. 3.  Add layers. Make the layers bigger. Train for more epochs.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  110   Always  monitor  the  training  loss  and  validation  loss,  as  well  as  the  training  and validation  values  for  any  metrics  you  care  about.  When  you  see  that  the  model’s performance on the validation data begins to degrade, you’ve achieved overfitting.  The next stage is to start regularizing and tuning the model, to get as close as possible  to the ideal model that neither underfits nor overfits.  4.5.7 Regularizing your model and tuning your hyperparameters  This step will take the most time: you’ll repeatedly modify your model, train it, evaluate on your validation data  not the test data, at this point , modify it again, and repeat, until the model is as good as it can get. These are some things you should try:  Add dropout. Try different architectures: add or remove layers. Add L1 and or L2 regularization. Try different hyperparameters  such as the number of units per layer or the learning rate of the optimizer  to find the optimal configuration. Optionally, iterate on feature engineering: add new features, or remove features that don’t seem to be informative.  Be  mindful  of  the  following:  every  time  you  use  feedback  from  your  validation process to tune your model, you leak information about the validation process into the model. Repeated just a few times, this is innocuous; but done systematically over many iterations, it will eventually cause your model to overfit to the validation process  even though  no  model  is  directly  trained  on  any  of  the  validation  data .  This  makes  the evaluation process less reliable, so keep it in mind.  Once you’ve developed a good enough model configuration, you can train your final production model on all the available data  training and validation  and evaluate it one last time on the test set. If it turns out that performance on the test set is significantly worse than the performance measured on the validation data, this may mean either that your validation procedure wasn’t reliable after all, or that you started overfitting to the validation data while tuning the parameters of the model. In this case, you may want to switch to a more reliable evaluation protocol  such as iterated K-fold validation .  4.6 Summary  Define the problem at hand and the data on which you’ll be training. Collect this data, or annotate it with labels if need be. Choose how you’ll measure success on your problem. Which metrics will you monitor on your validation data? Determine your evaluation protocol: hold-out validation? K-fold validation? Which portion of the data should you use for validation? Develop a first model that does better than a basic baseline: a model with statistical power. Develop a model that overfits. Regularize your model and tune its hyperparameters, based on performance on the validation data. A lot of machine-learning research tends to focus only on this step—but keep the big picture in mind.

You’ll learn to apply convnets to image-classification problems—in particular those involving small training datasets, which are the most common use case if you aren’t a large tech company.  convnets  5.1 Introduction to convnets  We’re about to dive into the theory of what convnets are and why they have been so successful  at  computer  vision  tasks.  But  first,  let’s  take  a  practical  look  at  a  simple convnet example. It uses a convnet to classify MNIST digits, a task we performed in chapter 2 using a densely connected network  our test accuracy then was 97.8% . Even though  the  convnet  will  be  basic,  its  accuracy  will  blow  out  of  the  water  that  of  the densely connected model from chapter 2.  The following lines of code show you what a basic convnet looks like. It’s a stack of    layers.  You’ll  see  in  a  minute  exactly  layer_max_pooling_2d    and   layer_conv_2d what they do.  library keras   Listing 5.1 Instantiating a small convnet  model  %   layer_conv_2d filters = 32, kernel_size = c 3, 3 , activation = "relu",                 input_shape = c 28, 28, 1   %>%  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  112     layer_max_pooling_2d pool_size = c 2, 2   %>%   layer_conv_2d filters = 64, kernel_size = c 3, 3 , activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_max_pooling_2d pool_size = c 2, 2   %>%   layer_conv_2d filters = 64, kernel_size = c 3, 3 , activation = "relu"   Importantly,  a  convnet  takes  as  input  tensors  of  shape   image_height,    not  including  the  batch  dimension .  In  this  case, image_width,  image_channels  we’ll configure the convnet to process inputs of size  , which is the format of MNIST images. We do this by passing the argument input_shape = c 28, 28, 1  to the first layer.   28, 28, 1   Let’s display the architecture of the convnet so far:  > model  ________________________________________________________________ Layer  type                      Output Shape          Param  ================================================================ conv2d_1  Conv2D                  None, 26, 26, 32     320 ________________________________________________________________ maxpooling2d_1  MaxPooling2D      None, 13, 13, 32     0 ________________________________________________________________ conv2d_2  Conv2D                  None, 11, 11, 64     18496 ________________________________________________________________ maxpooling2d_2  MaxPooling2D      None, 5, 5, 64       0 ________________________________________________________________ conv2d_3  Conv2D                  None, 3, 3, 64       36928 ================================================================ Total params: 55,744 Trainable params: 55,744 Non-trainable params: 0   and   layer_conv_2d  layer_max_pooling_2d  You can see that the output of every    is a 3D tensor of shape  . The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network. The number of channels is controlled by the first argument passed to the    height, width, channels     32 or 64 . The next step is to feed the last output tensor  of shape     into a densely connected  classifier  network  like  those  you’re  already  familiar  with:  a  stack  of  dense layers. These classifiers process vectors, which are 1D, whereas the current output is a 3D tensor. First we have to flatten the 3D outputs to 1D, and then add a few dense layers on top.  layer_conv_2d   3, 3, 64   Listing 5.2 Adding a classifier on top of the convnet  model  %   layer_flatten   %>%   layer_dense units = 64, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 10, activation = "softmax"   We’ll  do  10-way  classification,  using  a  final  layer  with  10  outputs  and  a  softmax  activation.

Not bad!  But why does this simple convnet work so well, compared to a densely connected  let’s  dive   into  what   layer_conv_2d    and   model?  To  answer  layer_max_pooling_2d  this,   actually do.  5.1.1 The convolution operation  The fundamental difference between a densely connected layer and a convolution layer is this: dense layers learn global patterns in their input feature space  for example, for a MNIST  digit,  patterns  involving  all  pixels ,  whereas  convolution  layers  learn  local patterns   see  figure  5.1 :  that  is,  in  the  case  of  images,  patterns  found  in  small  2D windows of the inputs. In the previous example, these windows were all 3 × 3.  Figure 5.1 Images can be broken into local patterns such as edges, textures, and so on.  This key characteristic gives convnets two interesting properties:  the visual world is fundamentally translation invariant  The patterns they learn are translation-invariant. After learning a certain pattern in the lower-right corner of a picture, a convnet can recognize it anywhere: for example, in the upper-left corner. A densely connected network would have to learn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This makes convnets data-efficient when processing images  because training samples to learn representations that have generalization power. They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns  see figure 5.2 . A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolution layer will learn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows convnets to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts  because the visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical   : they need fewer   .  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  115   Figure 5.2 The visual world forms a spatial hierarchy of visual modules: hyperlocal edges combine into local objects such as eyes or ears, which combine into high-level concepts such as "cat."   and   depth  width  channels  feature maps    as well as a    axis  also called the   Convolutions operate over 3D tensors, called   , with two spatial axes   height  axis . For an RGB image, the dimension of the depth axis is 3, because the image has 3 color channels: red, green, and blue. For a black-and-white picture, like the MNIST digits, the depth is 1  levels of gray . The convolution operation extracts patches from its input feature map and applies the same transformation to all of these patches, producing an output feature map . This output feature map is still a 3D tensor: it has a width and a height. Its depth can be arbitrary, because the output depth is a parameter of the layer, and the different channels in that depth axis no longer stand for specific colors as in RGB input; rather, they stand for  . Filters encode specific aspects of the input data: at a high level, a single filter could encode the concept "presence of a face in the input," for instance.  filters   and outputs a feature map of size   In the MNIST example, the first convolution layer takes a feature map of size  28, : it computes 32 filters over its 28, 1  input. Each of these 32 output channels contains a 26 × 26 grid of values, which is a  response map  of the filter over the input, indicating the response of that filter pattern at  means: different locations in the input  see figure 5.3 . That is what the term  every dimension in the depth axis is a feature  or filter , and the 2D tensor  output[:, :, n]   of the response of this filter over the input.   is the 2D spatial   feature map   26, 26, 32   map  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  116   Figure 5.3 The concept of a response map: a 2D map of the presence of a pattern at different locations in an input  Convolutions are defined by two key parameters:  Size of the patches extracted from the inputs—These are typically 3 × 3 or 5 × 5. In the example, they were 3 × 3, which is a common choice. Depth of the output feature map—That is, the number of filters computed by the convolution. The example started with a depth of 32 and ended with a depth of 64.

Border effects, which can be countered by padding the input feature map The use of   , which we’ll define in a second  strides  Let’s take a deeper look at these notions.  UNDERSTANDING BORDER EFFECTS AND PADDING Consider a 5 × 5 feature map  25 tiles total . There are only 9 tiles around which you can center a 3 × 3 window, forming a 3 × 3 grid  see figure 5.5 . Hence the output feature map will be 3 × 3. It shrinks a little: by exactly two tiles alongside each dimension, in this case. You can see this border effect in action in the earlier example: you start with 28 × 28 inputs, which become 26 × 26 after the first convolution layer.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  118   Figure 5.5 Valid locations of 3 × 3 patches in a 5 × 5 input feature map  padding  If you want to get an output feature map with the same spatial dimensions as the input, you can use  . Padding consists of adding an appropriate number of rows and columns on each side of the input feature map so as to make it possible to fit center convolution windows around every input tile. For a 3 × 3 window, you’d add one column on the right, one column on the left, one row at the top, and one row at the bottom. For a 5 × 5 window, you’d add two rows  see figure 5.6 .  Figure 5.6 Padding a 5 × 5 input in order to be able to extract 25 3 × 3 patches  In   layer_conv_2d  "valid"  takes two values:  be used ; and  same width and height as the input." The   "same"   layers, padding is configurable via the    argument, which , which means no padding  only valid window locations will , which means "pad in such a way as to have an output with the  padding  padding   argument defaults to   "valid"  .

The description of convolution so far has assumed that the center tile of the convolution windows are all contiguous.  But  the  distance  between  two  successive  windows  is  a  parameter  of  the strided convolution,  called  its  convolutions : convolutions with a stride higher than one. In figure 5.7, you can see the patches  extracted  by  a  3  x  3  convolution  with  stride  2  over  a  5  ×  5  input   without padding .  ,  which  defaults  to  1.  It’s  possible  to  have   strides  stride  5.1.2 The max-pooling operation  Figure 5.7 3 × 3 convolution patches with 2 × 2 strides  Using stride 2 means the width and height of the feature map are downsampled by a factor of 2  in addition to any changes induced by border effects . Strided convolutions are rarely used in practice, although they can come in handy for some types of models; it’s good to be familiar with the concept.  To  downsample  feature  maps,  instead  of  strides,  we  tend  to  use  the  max-pooing operation, which you saw in action in the first convnet example. Let’s look at it in more depth.  every   layer_max_pooling_2d  In the convnet example, you may have noticed that the size of the feature maps is halved after  ,  the  feature  map  is  26  ×  26,  but  the  max-pooing  operation layer_max_pooling_2d halves it to 13 × 13. That’s the role of max pooling: to aggressively downsample feature maps, much like strided convolutions.  instance,  before   .  For   first   the   Max  pooling  consists  of  extracting  windows  from  the  input  feature  maps  and outputting the max value of each channel. It’s conceptually similar to convolution, except that  instead  of  transforming  local  patches  via  a  learned  linear  transformation   the convolution kernel , they’re transformed via a hard-coded   tensor operation. A big difference from convolution is that max pooling is usually done with 2 × 2 windows and stride 2, in order to downsample the feature maps by a factor of 2. On the other hand, convolution is typically done with 3 × 3 windows and no stride  stride 1 .  max  Why downsample feature maps this way? Why not remove the max-pooing layers and  keep  fairly  large  feature  maps  all  the  way  up?  Let’s  look  at  this  option.

Two things:  It isn’t conducive to learning a spatial hierarchy of features. The 3 × 3 windows in the third layers will only contain information coming from 7 × 7 windows in the initial input. The high-level patterns learned by the convnet will still be very small with regard to the initial input, which may not be enough to learn to classify digits  try recognizing a digit by only looking at it through windows that are 7 × 7 pixels! . We need the features from the last convolution layer to contain information about the totality of the input. The final feature map has 22 * 22 * 64 = 30,976 total coefficients per sample. This is huge. If you were to flatten it to stick a dense layer of size 512 on top, that layer would have 15.8 million parameters. This is far too large for such a small model and would result in intense overfitting.  In  short,  the  reason  to  use  downsampling  is  to  reduce  the  number  of  feature-map coefficients  to  process,  as  well  as  to  induce  spatial-filter  hierarchies  by  making successive convolution layers look at increasingly large windows  in terms of the fraction of the original input they cover .  Note that max pooling isn’t the only way you can achieve such downsampling. As you already know, you can also use strides in the previous convolution layer. And you can  use  average  pooling  instead  of  max  pooling,  where  each  local  input  patch  is transformed by taking the average value of each channel over the patch, rather than the max. But max pooling tends to work better than these alternative solutions. In a nutshell, the reason is that features tend to encode the spatial presence of some pattern or concept  , and it’s more over the different tiles of the feature map  hence the term  average informative to look at the  presence . So the most reasonable subsampling strategy is to first produce dense maps of features   via  unstrided  convolutions   and  then  look  at  the  maximal  activation  of  the features over small patches, rather than looking at sparser windows of the inputs  via   of different features than at their   maximal presence  feature map  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  121   strided convolutions  or averaging input patches, which could cause you to miss or dilute feature-presence information.  At  this  point,  you  should  understand  the  basics  of  convnets—feature  maps, convolution, and max pooling—and you know how to build a small convnet to solve a toy  problem  such  as  MNIST  digits  classification.  Now  let’s  move  on  to  more  useful, practical applications.  5.2 Training a convnet from scratch on a small dataset  Having  to  train  an  image-classification  model  using  very  little  data  is  a  common situation, which you’ll likely encounter in practice if you ever do computer vision in a professional context. A "few" samples can mean anywhere from a few hundred to a few tens of thousands of images. As a practical example, we’ll focus on classifying images as dogs or cats, in a dataset containing 4,000 pictures of cats and dogs  2,000 cats, 2,000 dogs . We’ll use 2,000 pictures for training, 1,000 for validation, and 1,000 for testing.  In this section, we’ll review one basic strategy to tackle this problem: training a new model from scratch using what little data you have. You’ll start by naively training a small convnet on the 2,000 training samples, without any regularization, to set a baseline for what can be achieved. This will get you to a classification accuracy of 71%. At that point,  the  main  issue  will  be  overfitting.  Then  we’ll  introduce  ,  a powerful  technique  for  mitigating  overfitting  in  computer  vision.  By  using  data augmentation, you’ll improve the network to reach an accuracy of 82%.  data  augmentation  feature extraction with a pretrained network  In  the  next  section,  we’ll  review  two  more  essential  techniques  for  applying  deep learning to small datasets:    which will get you to an accuracy of 90% to 96%  and    this will get you to a final accuracy of 97% . Together, these three strategies—training a small model from  scratch,  doing  feature  extraction  using  a  pretrained  model,  and  fine-tuning  a pretrained  model—will  constitute  your  future  toolbox  for  tackling  the  problem  of performing computer vision with small datasets.  fine-tuning a pretrained network  5.2.1 The relevance of deep learning for small-data problems  You’ll sometimes hear that deep learning only works when lots of data is available. This is  valid  in  part:  one  fundamental  characteristic  of  deep  learning  is  that  it  can  find interesting features in the training data on its own, without any need for manual feature engineering, and this can only be achieved when lots of training examples are available. This is especially true for problems where the input samples are very high-dimensional, like images.  But what constitutes lots of samples is relative—relative to the size and depth of the network you’re trying to train, for starters. It isn’t possible to train a convnet to solve a complex  problem  with  just  a  few  tens  of  samples,  but  a  few  hundred  can  potentially suffice  if  the  model  is  small  and  well  regularized  and  the  task  is  simple.  Because convnets  learn  local,  translation-invariant  features,  they’re  highly  data-efficient  on perceptual problems. Training a convnet from scratch on a very small image dataset will  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  122   still  yield  reasonable  results  despite  a  relative  lack  of  data,  without  the  need  for  any custom feature engineering. You’ll see this in action in this section.  What’s more, deep-learning models are by nature highly repurposable: you can take, say, an image-classification or speech-to-text model trained on a large-scale dataset and reuse it on a significantly different problem with only minor changes. Specifically, in the case  of  computer  vision,  many  pretrained  models   usually  trained  on  the  ImageNet dataset  are now publicly available for download and can be used to bootstrap powerful vision models out of very little data. That’s what you’ll do in the next section. Let’s start by getting your hands on the data.  5.2.2 Downloading the data  The  Dogs  vs.  Cats  dataset  that  you’ll  use  isn’t  packaged  with  Keras.  It  was  made available by Kaggle as part of a computer-vision competition in late 2013, back when convnets  weren’t  mainstream.  You  can  download  the  original  dataset  from www.kaggle.com c dogs-vs-cats data  you’ll need to create a Kaggle account if you don’t already have one—don’t worry, the process is painless .  The pictures are medium-resolution color JPEGs. Figure 5.8 shows some examples.  Figure 5.8 Samples from the Dogs vs. Cats dataset. Sizes weren’t modified: the samples are heterogenous in size, appearance, and so on.  Unsurprisingly,  the  cats-versus-dogs  Kaggle  competition  in  2013  was  won  by entrants  who  used  convnets.  The  best  entries  achieved  up  to  95%  accuracy.  In  this example, you’ll get fairly close to this accuracy  in the next section , even though you’ll be  training  your  models  on  less  than  10%  of  the  data  that  was  available  to  the competitors.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  123   This dataset contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats  12,500 from each class  and is 543  MB   compressed .  After  downloading  and  uncompressing  it,  you’ll  create  a  new dataset  containing  three  subsets:  a  training  set  with  1,000  samples  of  each  class,  a validation set with 500 samples of each class, and a test set with 500 samples of each class.  Following is the code to do this.  Listing 5.4 Copying images to train, validation, and test directories  original_dataset_dir <- "~ Downloads kaggle_original_data"  base_dir <- "~ Downloads cats_and_dogs_small" dir.create base_dir   train_dir <- file.path base_dir, "train"  dir.create train_dir  validation_dir <- file.path base_dir, "validation"  dir.create validation_dir  test_dir <- file.path base_dir, "test"  dir.create test_dir   train_cats_dir <- file.path train_dir, "cats"  dir.create train_cats_dir   train_dogs_dir <- file.path train_dir, "dogs"  dir.create train_dogs_dir   validation_cats_dir <- file.path validation_dir, "cats"  dir.create validation_cats_dir   validation_dogs_dir <- file.path validation_dir, "dogs"  dir.create validation_dogs_dir   test_cats_dir <- file.path test_dir, "cats"  dir.create test_cats_dir   test_dogs_dir <- file.path test_dir, "dogs"  dir.create test_dogs_dir   fnames <- paste0 "cat.", 1:1000, ".jpg"  file.copy file.path original_dataset_dir, fnames ,           file.path train_cats_dir    fnames <- paste0 "cat.", 1001:1500, ".jpg"  file.copy file.path original_dataset_dir, fnames ,           file.path validation_cats_dir    fnames <- paste0 "cat.", 1501:2000, ".jpg"  file.copy file.path original_dataset_dir, fnames ,           file.path test_cats_dir    fnames <- paste0 "dog.", 1:1000, ".jpg"  file.copy file.path original_dataset_dir, fnames ,           file.path train_dogs_dir    fnames <- paste0 "dog.", 1001:1500, ".jpg"  file.copy file.path original_dataset_dir, fnames ,           file.path validation_dogs_dir    fnames <- paste0 "dog.", 1501:2000, ".jpg"  file.copy file.path original_dataset_dir, fnames ,           file.path test_dogs_dir    As  a  sanity  check,  let’s  count  how  many  pictures  are  in  each  training  split   train validation test :  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  124   > cat "total training cat images:", length list.files train_cats_dir  , "\n"  total training cat images: 1000 > cat "total training dog images:", length list.files train_dogs_dir  , "\n"  total training dog images: 1000 > cat "total validation cat images:", length list.files validation_cats_dir  , "\n"  total validation cat images: 500 > cat "total validation dog images:", length list.files validation_dogs_dir  , "\n"  total validation dog images: 500 > cat "total test cat images:", length list.files test_cats_dir  , "\n"  total test cat images: 500 > cat "total test dog images:", length list.files test_dogs_dir  , "\n"  total test dog images: 500  5.2.3 Building your network  So you have indeed 2,000 training images, 1,000 validation images, and 1,000 test images.  Each  split  contains  the  same  number  of  samples  from  each  class:  this  is  a balanced binary-classification problem, which means classification accuracy will be an appropriate measure of success.  You built a small convnet for MNIST in the previous example, so you should be familiar with convnets. You’ll reuse the same general structure: the convnet will be a stack of alternated  layer_max_pooling_2d   activation  and   layer_conv_2d   stages.    with   relu  But because you’re dealing with bigger images and a more complex problem, you’ll make  your  network  larger,  accordingly:  it  will  have  one  more    +   stage. This serves both to augment the capacity of the network layer_max_pooling_2d and to further reduce the size of the feature maps so they aren’t overly large when you reach  the  .  Here,  because  you  start  from  inputs  of  size  150  ×  150   a somewhat arbitrary choice , you end up with feature maps of size 7 × 7 just before the  layer_flatten  layer_conv_2d  layer_flatten  .  NOTE  The  depth  of  the  feature  maps  progressively  increases  in  the  network  from 32 to 128 , whereas the size of the feature maps decreases  from 148 × 148 to 7 × 7 . This is a pattern you’ll see in almost all convnets.  Because you’re attacking a binary-classification problem, you’ll end the network with  activation.

Currently,  the  data  sits  on  a drive as JPEG files, so the steps for getting it into the network are roughly as follows:  1. 2. 3.  Read the picture files. Decode the JPEG content to RGB grids of pixels. Convert these into floating-point tensors.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  126   4. Rescale the pixel values  between 0 and 255  to the [0, 1] interval  as you know, neural  networks prefer to deal with small input values .  It may seem a bit daunting, but thankfully Keras has utilities to take care of these steps  automatically.  Keras  includes  a  number  of  image  processing  helper  tools.  In particular, it includes the   function, which can automatically turn image files on disk into batches of pre-processed tensors. This is what we will use here.  image_data_generator    Listing 5.7 Using   image_data_generator   to read images from directories  train_datagen <- image_data_generator rescale = 1 255  validation_datagen <- image_data_generator rescale = 1 255   train_generator <- flow_images_from_directory    train_dir,   train_datagen,   target_size = c 150, 150 ,   batch_size = 20,   class_mode = "binary"    validation_generator <- flow_images_from_directory    validation_dir,   validation_datagen,   target_size = c 150, 150 ,   batch_size = 20,   class_mode = "binary"    Let’s look at the output of one of these generators: it yields batches of 150 × 150  .

The training accuracy increases linearly over time, until it reaches nearly 100%, whereas the validation accuracy stalls at 71–75%. The validation loss reaches its minimum after only five epochs and then stalls, whereas the training loss keeps decreasing linearly until it reaches nearly 0.  Because you have relatively few training samples  2,000 , overfitting will be your number-one  concern.  You  already  know  about  a  number  of  techniques  that  can  help mitigate overfitting, such as dropout and weight decay  L2 regularization . We’re now going to introduce a new one, specific to computer vision and used almost universally when processing images with deep-learning models:   data augmentation  .  5.2.5 Using data augmentation  Overfitting is caused by having too few samples to learn from, rendering you unable to train a model that can generalize to new data. Given infinite data, your model would be exposed  to  every  possible  aspect  of  the  data  distribution  at  hand:  you  would  never overfit.  Data  augmentation  takes  the  approach  of  generating  more  training  data  from existing  training  samples,  by    the  samples  via  a  number  of  random transformations that yield believable-looking images. The goal is that at training time, your model will never see the exact same picture twice. This helps expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.  augmenting  In Keras, this can be done by configuring a number of random transformations to be . Let’s get started with an  image_data_generator  performed on the images read by an  example.

Let’s quickly go over this code:  height_shift   are ranges  as a fraction of total width or height   rotation_range is a value in degrees  0–180 , a range within which to randomly rotate pictures. width_shift and  within which to randomly translate pictures vertically or horizontally. shear_range is for randomly applying shearing transformations. zoom_range is for randomly zooming inside pictures. horizontal_flip is for randomly flipping half the images horizontally—relevant when there are no assumptions of horizontal asymmetry  for example, real-world pictures . fill_mode is the strategy used for filling in newly created pixels, which can appear after a rotation or a width height shift.  Let’s look at the augmented images  see figure 5.10 .

Plot the images  Figure 5.10 Generation of cat pictures via random data augmentation  If you train a new network using this data-augmentation configuration, the network will never see the same input twice. But the inputs it sees are still heavily intercorrelated, because  they  come  from  a  small  number  of  original  images—you  can’t  produce  new information, you can only remix existing information. As such, this may not be enough to completely get rid of overfitting. To further fight overfitting, you’ll also add a dropout layer to your model, right before the densely connected classifier.

Listing 5.16 Saving the model  model %>% save_model_hdf5 "cats_and_dogs_small_2.h5"   Thanks to data augmentation and dropout, we are no longer overfitting: the training curves are rather closely tracking the validation curves. We are now able to reach an accuracy of 82%, a 15% relative improvement over the non-regularized model.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  132   Figure 5.11 Training and validation metrics  By  using  regularization  techniques  even  further,  and  by  tuning  the  network’s parameters  such as the number of filters per convolution layer, or the number of layers in the network , you may be able to get an even better accuracy, likely up to 86 or 87%. But it would prove difficult to go any higher just by training your own convnet from scratch, because you have so little data to work with. As a next step to improve your accuracy on this problem, you’ll have to use a pretrained model, which will be the focus of the next two sections.  5.3 Using a pretrained convnet  pretrained network  A common and highly effective approach to deep learning on small image datasets is to use a pretrained network. A   is a saved network that was previously trained  on  a  large  dataset,  typically  on  a  large-scale  image-classification  task.  If  this original dataset is large enough and general enough, then the spatial-feature hierarchy learned by the pretrained network can effectively act as a generic model of the visual world,  and  hence  its  features  can  prove  useful  for  many  different  computer-vision problems, even though these new problems may involve completely different classes than those of the original task. For instance, you might train a network on ImageNet  where classes are mostly animals and everyday objects  and then repurpose this trained network for  something  as  remote  as  identifying  furniture  items  in  images.  Such  portability  of learned features across different problems is a key advantage of deep learning compared to many older, shallow-learning approaches, and it makes deep learning very effective for small-data problems.  In  this  case,  let’s  consider  a  large  convnet  trained  on  the  ImageNet  dataset   1.4  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  133   million  labeled  images  and  1,000  different  classes .  ImageNet  contains  many  animal classes, including different species of cats and dogs, and you can thus expect to perform well on the cats-versus-dogs classification problem.  You’ll  use  the  VGG16  architecture,  developed  by  Karen  Simonyan  and  Andrew Zisserman in 2014; it’s a simple and widely used convnet architecture for ImageNet.8 Although it’s an older model, far from the current state of the art and somewhat heavier than many other recent models, we chose it because its architecture is similar to what you’re  already  familiar  with  and  is  easy  to  understand  without  introducing  any  new concepts.  This  may  be  your  first  encounter  with  one  of  these  cutesy  model names—VGG,  ResNet,  Inception,  Inception-ResNet,  Xception,  and  so  on;  you’ll  get used to them, because they will come up frequently if you keep doing deep learning for computer vision.  Footnote 8mKaren Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman, "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition," Cornell University Library  2014 ,  arxiv.org abs 1409.1556 . feature extraction There are two ways to use a pretrained network:   We’ll cover both of them. Let’s start with feature extraction.   and   fine-tuning  .  5.3.1 Feature extraction  Feature extraction consists of using the representations learned by a previous network to extract interesting features from new samples. These features are then run through a new classifier, which is trained from scratch.  As you saw previously, convnets used for image classification comprise two parts: they start with a series of pooling and convolution layers, and they end with a densely connected classifier. The first part is called the   of the model. In the case  of  convnets,  feature  extraction  consists  of  taking  the  convolutional  base  of  a previously trained network, running the new data through it, and training a new classifier on top of the output  see figure 5.12 .  convolutional base  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  134   Figure 5.12 Swapping classifiers while keeping the same convolutional base  Why  only  reuse  the  convolutional  base?  Could  you  reuse  the  densely  connected classifier  as  well?  In  general,  doing  so  should  be  avoided.  The  reason  is  that  the representations  learned  by  the  convolutional  base  are  likely  to  be  more  generic  and therefore  more  reusable:  the  feature  maps  of  a  convnet  are  presence  maps  of  generic concepts over a picture, which is likely to be useful regardless of the computer-vision problem  at  hand.  But  the  representations  learned  by  the  classifier  will  necessarily  be specific to the set of classes on which the model was trained—they will only contain information  about  the  presence  probability  of  this  or  that  class  in  the  entire  picture. Additionally, representations found in densely connected layers no longer contain any information about   objects are located in the input image: these layers get rid of the notion of space, whereas the object location is still described by convolutional feature maps. For problems where object location matters, densely connected features are largely useless.  where  Note  that  the  level  of  generality   and  therefore  reusability   of  the  representations extracted by specific convolution layers depends on the depth of the layer in the model. Layers that come earlier in the model extract local, highly generic feature maps  such as visual edges, colors, and textures , whereas layers that are higher up extract more abstract concepts  such as "cat ear" or "dog eye" . So if your new dataset differs a lot from the dataset on which the original model was trained, you may be better off using only the first  few  layers  of  the  model  to  do  feature  extraction,  rather  than  using  the  entire convolutional base.  In this case, because the ImageNet class set contains multiple dog and cat classes, it’s likely to be beneficial to reuse the information contained in the densely connected layers of the original model. But we’ll choose not to, in order to cover the more general case where the class set of the new problem doesn’t overlap the class set of the original model. Let’s put this in practice by using the convolutional base of the VGG16 network, trained  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  135   on ImageNet, to extract interesting features from cat and dog images, and then training a cats-versus-dogs classifier on top of these features.  The VGG16 model, among others, comes prepackaged with Keras. Here’s the list of image-classification models  all pretrained on the ImageNet dataset  that are available as part of Keras:  Xception InceptionV3 ResNet50 VGG16 VGG19 MobileNet  Let’s instantiate the VGG16 model.  Listing 5.17 Instantiating the VGG16 convolutional base  library keras   conv_base <- application_vgg16    weights = "imagenet",   include_top = FALSE,   input_shape = c 150, 150, 3     You pass three arguments to the function:  weights specifies the weight checkpoint from which to initialize the model. include_top refers to including  or not  the densely connected classifier on top of the network. By default, this densely connected classifier corresponds to the 1,000 classes from ImageNet. Because you intend to use your own densely connected classifier  with only two classes:  input_shape is the shape of the image tensors that you’ll feed to the network. This argument is purely optional: if you don’t pass it, the network will be able to process inputs of any size.   , you don’t need to include it.   and   dog  cat  Here’s the detail of the architecture of the VGG16 convolutional base. It’s similar to  the simple convnets you’re already familiar with.  > conv_base  Layer  type                      Output Shape          Param  ================================================================ input_1  InputLayer               None, 150, 150, 3    0 ________________________________________________________________ block1_conv1  Convolution2D       None, 150, 150, 64   1792 ________________________________________________________________ block1_conv2  Convolution2D       None, 150, 150, 64   36928 ________________________________________________________________ block1_pool  MaxPooling2D         None, 75, 75, 64     0 ________________________________________________________________ block2_conv1  Convolution2D       None, 75, 75, 128    73856 ________________________________________________________________ block2_conv2  Convolution2D       None, 75, 75, 128    147584 ________________________________________________________________ block2_pool  MaxPooling2D         None, 37, 37, 128    0  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  136   ________________________________________________________________ block3_conv1  Convolution2D       None, 37, 37, 256    295168 ________________________________________________________________ block3_conv2  Convolution2D       None, 37, 37, 256    590080 ________________________________________________________________ block3_conv3  Convolution2D       None, 37, 37, 256    590080 ________________________________________________________________ block3_pool  MaxPooling2D         None, 18, 18, 256    0 ________________________________________________________________ block4_conv1  Convolution2D       None, 18, 18, 512    1180160 ________________________________________________________________ block4_conv2  Convolution2D       None, 18, 18, 512    2359808 ________________________________________________________________ block4_conv3  Convolution2D       None, 18, 18, 512    2359808 ________________________________________________________________ block4_pool  MaxPooling2D         None, 9, 9, 512      0 ________________________________________________________________ block5_conv1  Convolution2D       None, 9, 9, 512      2359808 ________________________________________________________________ block5_conv2  Convolution2D       None, 9, 9, 512      2359808 ________________________________________________________________ block5_conv3  Convolution2D       None, 9, 9, 512      2359808 ________________________________________________________________ block5_pool  MaxPooling2D         None, 4, 4, 512      0 ================================================================ Total params: 14,714,688 Trainable params: 14,714,688 Non-trainable params: 0  The final feature map has shape    4,  4,  512   . That’s the feature on top of which  you’ll stick a densely connected classifier.  At this point, there are two ways you could proceed:  Running the convolutional base over your dataset, recording its output to an array on disk, and then using this data as input to a standalone, densely connected classifier similar to those you saw in part 1 of this book. This solution is fast and cheap to run, because it only requires running the convolutional base once for every input image, and the convolutional base is by far the most expensive part of the pipeline. But for the same reason, this technique won’t allow you to use data augmentation. Extending the model you have   the whole thing end to end on the input data. This will allow you to use data augmentation, because every input image goes through the convolutional base every time it’s seen by the model. But for the same reason, this technique is far more expensive than the first.    by adding dense layers on top, and running  conv_base  We’ll cover both techniques. Let’s walk through the code required to set up the first  on your data and using these outputs as inputs to  conv_base  one: recording the output of  a new model.  FAST FEATURE EXTRACTION WITHOUT DATA AUGMENTATION You’ll start by running instances of the previously introduced image_data_generator to  extract  images  as  arrays  as  well  as  their  labels.  You’ll  extract  features  from  these images by calling the    method on the model.  predict  Listing 5.18 Extracting features using the pretrained convolutional base  base_dir <- "~ Downloads cats_and_dogs_small" train_dir <- file.path base_dir, "train"  validation_dir <- file.path base_dir, "validation"   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  137   test_dir <- file.path base_dir, "test"   datagen <- image_data_generator rescale = 1 255  batch_size <- 20  extract_features <- function directory, sample_count  {    features <- array 0, dim = c sample_count, 4, 4, 512     labels <- array 0, dim = c sample_count      generator <- flow_images_from_directory      directory = directory,     generator = datagen,     target_size = c 150, 150 ,     batch_size = batch_size,     class_mode = "binary"        i <- 0   while TRUE  {     batch <- generator_next generator      inputs_batch <- batch[[1]]     labels_batch <- batch[[2]]     features_batch  % predict inputs_batch       index_range <-   i * batch_size +1 :  i + 1  * batch_size      features[index_range,,,] <- features_batch     labels[index_range] <- labels_batch      i <- i + 1     if  i * batch_size >= sample_count         break   }    list      features = features,     labels = labels     }  train <- extract_features train_dir, 2000  validation <- extract_features validation_dir, 1000  test <- extract_features test_dir, 1000   Note that because generators yield data indefinitely in a loop, you must break after every image has been seen once.  The extracted features are currently of shape   . You’ll feed them  to  a  densely  connected  classifier,  so  first  you  must  flatten  them  to   samples, 8192    samples, 4, 4, 512   :  reshape_features <- function features  {   array_reshape features, dim = c nrow features , 4 * 4 * 512   } train$features <- reshape_features train$features  validation$features <- reshape_features validation$features  test$features <- reshape_features test$features   At  this  point,  you  can  define  your  densely  connected  classifier   note  the  use  of  dropout for regularization  and train it on the data and labels that you just recorded.

Let’s look at the loss and accuracy curves during training  see figure 5.13 .  Listing 5.20 Plotting the results  plot history   Figure 5.13 Training and validation metrics for simple feature extraction  You reach a validation accuracy of about 90%: much better than you achieved in the previous section with the small model trained from scratch. But the plots also indicate  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  139   that you’re overfitting almost from the start—despite using dropout with a fairly large rate. That’s because this technique doesn’t use data augmentation, which is essential for preventing overfitting with small image datasets.  FEATURE EXTRACTION WITH DATA AUGMENTATION Now, let’s review the second technique we mentioned for doing feature extraction, which is  much  slower  and  more  expensive,  but  which  allows  you  to  use  data  augmentation during training: extending the   model and running it end to end on the inputs.  conv_base  NOTE  This technique is so expensive that you should only attempt it if you have access to a GPU—it’s absolutely intractable on a CPU. If you can’t run your code on a GPU, then the previous technique is the way to go.  Because models behave just like layers, you can add a model  like   conv_base    to a  sequential model just like you would add a layer. So, you can do the following.  Listing 5.21 Adding a densely connected classifier on top of the convolutional base  model  %   conv_base %>%   layer_flatten   %>%   layer_dense units = 256, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   This is what the model looks like now:  > model  Layer  type                      Output Shape          Param  ================================================================ vgg16  Model                      None, 4, 4, 512      14714688 ________________________________________________________________ flatten_1  Flatten                None, 8192           0 ________________________________________________________________ dense_1  Dense                    None, 256            2097408 ________________________________________________________________ dense_2  Dense                    None, 1              257 ================================================================ Total params: 16,812,353 Trainable params: 16,812,353 Non-trainable params: 0  As you can see, the convolutional base of VGG16 has 14,714,688 parameters, which  is very large. The classifier you’re adding on top has 2 million parameters.  Before  you  compile  and  train  the  model,  it’s  very  important  to  freeze  the convolutional base.   a layer or set of layers means preventing their weights from being updated during training. If you don’t do this, then the representations that were previously learned by the convolutional base will be modified during training. Because  Freezing  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  140   the  dense  layers  on  top  are  randomly  initialized,  very  large  weight  updates  would  be propagated  through  the  network,  effectively  destroying  the  representations  previously learned.  In Keras, you freeze a network using the   freeze_weights     function:  > cat "This is the number of trainable weights before freezing",       "the conv base:", length model$trainable_weights , "\n"  This is the number of trainable weights before freezing the conv base: 30 > freeze_weights conv_base  > cat "This is the number of trainable weights after freezing",       "the conv base:", length model$trainable_weights , "\n"  This is the number of trainable weights before freezing the conv base: 4  With this setup, only the weights from the two dense layers that you added will be trained. That’s a total of four weight tensors: two per layer  the main weight matrix and the bias vector . Note that in order for these changes to take effect, you must first compile the  model.  If  you  ever  modify  weight  trainability  after  compilation,  you  should  then recompile the model, or these changes will be ignored.  Now  you  can  start  training  your  model,  with  the  same  data-augmentation  configuration that you used in the previous example.  Listing 5.22 Training the model end to end with a frozen convolutional base  train_datagen = image_data_generator    rescale = 1 255,   rotation_range = 40,   width_shift_range = 0.2,   height_shift_range = 0.2,   shear_range = 0.2,   zoom_range = 0.2,   horizontal_flip = TRUE,   fill_mode = "nearest"    test_datagen <- image_data_generator rescale = 1 255   train_generator <- flow_images_from_directory    train_dir,   train_datagen,   target_size = c 150, 150 ,   batch_size = 20,   class_mode = "binary"    validation_generator <- flow_images_from_directory    validation_dir,   test_datagen,   target_size = c 150, 150 ,   batch_size = 20,   class_mode = "binary"    model %>% compile    loss = "binary_crossentropy",   optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop lr = 2e-5 ,   metrics = c "accuracy"     history  % fit_generator    train_generator,   steps_per_epoch = 100,  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  141     epochs = 30,   validation_data = validation_generator,   validation_steps = 50    Let’s plot the results again  see figure 5.14 . As you can see, you reach a validation accuracy of about 96%. This is much better than you achieved with the small convnet trained from scratch.  Figure 5.14 Training and validation metrics for feature extraction with data augmentation  5.3.2 Fine-tuning  Another widely used technique for model reuse, complementary to feature extraction, is  fine-tuning   see figure 5.15 . Fine-tuning consists of unfreezing a few of the top layers of a frozen model base used for feature extraction, and jointly training both the newly added part of the model  in this case, the fully connected classifier  and these top layers. This is called    because  it  slightly  adjusts  the  more  abstract  representations  of  the model being reused, in order to make them more relevant for the problem at hand.  fine-tuning  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  142   Figure 5.15 Fine-tuning the last convolutional block of the VGG16 network  We stated earlier that it was necessary to freeze the convolution base of VGG16 in order to be able to train a randomly initialized classifier on top. For the same reason, it’s only possible to fine-tune the top layers of the convolutional base once the classifier on top has already been trained. If the classifier wasn’t already trained, then the error signal propagating  through  the  network  during  training  would  be  too  large,  and  the representations  previously  learned  by  the  layers  being  fine-tuned  would  be  destroyed. Thus the steps for fine-tuning a network are as follow:  1. 2.  Add your custom network on top of an already-trained base network. Freeze the base network.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  143   3. 4. 5.  Train the part you added. Unfreeze some layers in the base network. Jointly train both these layers and the part you added.  You  already  completed  the  first  three  steps  when  doing  feature  extraction.  Let’s   and  then  freeze  individual  conv_base  proceed  with  the  step  4:  you’ll  unfreeze  your  layers inside it.

Why not fine-tune more layers? Why not fine-tune the entire convolutional base? You  could. But you need to consider the following:  Earlier layers in the convolutional base encode more generic, reusable features, whereas layers higher up encode more specialized features. It’s more useful to fine-tune the more specialized features, because these are the ones that need to be repurposed on your new  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  144   problem. There would be fast-decreasing returns in fine-tuning lower layers. The more parameters you’re training, the more you’re at risk of overfitting. The convolutional base has 15 million parameters, so it would be risky to attempt to train it on your small dataset.  Thus, in this situation, it’s a good strategy to fine-tune only the top two or three layers in  the  convolutional  base.  Let’s  set  this  up,  starting  from  where  you  left  off  in  the previous example.  Listing 5.23 Unfreezing previously frozen layers  unfreeze_weights conv_base, from = "block5_conv1"   Now  you  can  begin  fine-tuning  the  network.  You’ll  do  this  with  the  RMSProp optimizer, using a very low learning rate. The reason for using a low learning rate is that you want to limit the magnitude of the modifications you make to the representations of the  three  layers  you’re  fine-tuning.  Updates  that  are  too  large  may  harm  these representations.  Now let’s proceed with fine-tuning.  Listing 5.24 Fine-tuning the model  model %>% compile    loss = "binary_crossentropy",   optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop lr = 1e-5 ,   metrics = c "accuracy"     history  % fit_generator    train_generator,   steps_per_epoch = 100,   epochs = 100,   validation_data = validation_generator,   validation_steps = 50    Let’s plot our results :  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  145   Figure 5.16 Training and validation metrics for fine-tuning  You’re seeing a nice 1% absolute improvement in accuracy, from about 96% to above  97%.  Note  that  the  loss  curve  doesn’t  show  any  real  improvement   in  fact,  it’s deteriorating . You may wonder, how could accuracy stay stable or improve if the loss isn’t decreasing? The answer is simple: what you display is an average of pointwise loss values;  but  what  matters  for  accuracy  is  the  distribution  of  the  loss  values,  not  their average, because accuracy is the result of a binary thresholding of the class probability predicted by the model. The model may still be improving even if this isn’t reflected in the average loss.  You can now finally evaluate this model on the test data:  test_generator <- flow_images_from_directory    test_dir,   test_datagen,   target_size = c 150, 150 ,   batch_size = 20,   class_mode = "binary"    > model %>% evaluate_generator test_generator, steps = 50  $loss [1] 0.2840393  $acc [1] 0.972  Here you get a test accuracy of 97.2%. In the original Kaggle competition around this dataset,  this  would  have  been  one  of  the  top  results.  But  using  modern  deep-learning techniques, you managed to reach this result using only a small fraction of the training  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  146   data available  about 10% . There is a huge difference between being able to train on 20,000 samples compared to 2,000 samples!  5.3.3 Take-aways: using convnets with small datasets  Here’s what you should take away from the exercises of the past two sections:  Convnets are the best type of machine-learning models for computer-vision tasks. It’s possible to train one from scratch even on a very small dataset, with decent results. On a small dataset, overfitting will be the main issue. Data augmentation is a powerful way to fight overfitting when you’re working with image data. It’s easy to reuse an existing convnet on a new dataset via feature extraction. This is a valuable technique for working with small image datasets. As a complement to feature extraction, you can use fine-tuning, which adapts to a new problem some of the representations previously learned by an existing model. This pushes performance a bit further.  Now you have a solid set of tools for dealing with image-classification problems—in  particular with small datasets.  5.4 Visualizing what convnets learn  It’s often said that deep-learning models are "black boxes": learning representations that are difficult to extract and present in a human-readable form. Although this is partially true for certain types of deep-learning models, it’s definitely not true for convnets. The representations learned by convnets are highly amenable to visualization, in large part because  they’re  .  Since  2013,  a  wide  array  of techniques  have  been  developed  for  visualizing  and  interpreting  these  representations. We won’t survey all of them, but we’ll cover three of the most accessible and useful ones:  representations  of  visual  concepts  Visualizing intermediate convnet outputs  intermediate activations —Useful for understanding how successive convnet layers transform their input, and for getting a first idea of the meaning of individual convnet filters. Visualizing convnets filters—Useful for understanding precisely what visual pattern or concept each filter in a convnet is receptive to. Visualizing heatmaps of class activation in an image—Useful for understanding which parts of an image were identified as belonging to a given class, and thus allows you to localize objects in images.  For the first method—activation visualization—you’ll use the small convnet that you trained from scratch on the cats-versus-dogs classification problem in section 5.2. For the next two methods, you’ll use the VGG16 model that we introduced in section 5.3.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  147   5.4.1 Visualizing intermediate activations  activation  Visualizing  intermediate  activations  consists  of  displaying  the  feature  maps  that  are output by various convolution and pooling layers in a network, given a certain input  the output of a layer is often called its  , the output of the activation function . This gives a view into how an input is decomposed unto the different filters learned by the network. These feature maps you want to visualize have three dimensions: width, height, and  depth   channels .  Each  channel  encodes  relatively  independent  features,  so  the proper way to visualize these feature maps is by independently plotting the contents of every channel as a 2D image.

Listing 5.26 Displaying the test picture  plot as.raster img_tensor[1,,,]    Figure 5.17 The test cat picture  In order to extract the feature maps you want to look at, you’ll create a Keras model that takes batches of images as input, and outputs the activations of all convolution and pooling layers. To do this, we will use the   function, which takes two arguments: an input tensor  or list of input tensors  and an output tensor  or list of output tensors .  The  resulting  class  is  a  Keras  model,  just  like  the  ones  created  by  the   function that you are familiar with, mapping the specified keras_sequential_model   inputs to the specified outputs. What sets this type of model apart apart is that it allows for  models  with  multiple  outputs   unlike   .

This is the first time you’ve encountered a multi-output model in this book: until now, the models you’ve seen have had exactly one input and one output. In the general case, a model can have any number of inputs and outputs. This one has one input and eight outputs: one output per layer activation.

Let’s  try  the  seventh channel   see  figure  5.19 —but  note  that  your  own  channels  may  vary,  because  the specific filters learned by convolution layers aren’t deterministic.

We’ll  extract  and  plot  every  channel  in  each  of  our  8 activation maps, and we will stack the results in one big image tensor, with channels stacked side by side.

At that stage, the activations retain almost all of the information present in the initial picture. As you go higher, the activations become increasingly abstract and less visually interpretable. They begin to encode higher-level concepts such as "cat ear" and "cat eye." Higher presentations carry increasingly less information about the visual contents of the image, and increasingly more information related to the class of the image. The sparsity of the activations is increasing with the depth of the layer: in the first layer, all filters are activated by the input image, but in the following layers some filters are blank. This means that the pattern encoded by the filter isn’t found in the input image.  We have just evidenced an important universal characteristic of the representations learned by deep neural networks: the features extracted by a layer become increasingly abstract with the depth of the layer. The activations of higher layers carry less and less  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  153   information about the specific input being seen, and more and more information about the  target   in  this  case,  the  class  of  the  image:  cat  or  dog .  A  deep  neural  network effectively acts as an  , with raw data going in  in this case, RGB pictures  and being repeatedly transformed so that irrelevant information is filtered  out   for  example,  the  specific  visual  appearance  of  the  image   and  useful information is magnified and refined  for example, the class of the image .  information distillation pipeline  This is analogous to the way humans and animals perceive the world: after observing a scene for a few seconds, a human can remember which abstract objects were present in it  bicycle, tree  but can’t remember the specific appearance of these objects. In fact, if you tried to draw a generic bicycle from memory, chances are you couldn’t get it even remotely right, even though you’ve seen thousands of bicycles in your lifetime  see, for example,  figure  5.24 .  Try  it  right  now:  this  effect  is  absolutely  real.  You  brain  has learned  to  completely  abstract  its  visual  input—to  transform  it  into  high-level  visual concepts while filtering out irrelevant visual details—making it tremendously difficult to remember how things around you look.  Figure 5.24 Left: attempts to draw a bicycle from memory. Right: what a schematic bicycle should look like.  5.4.2 Visualizing convnet filters  Another easy thing to do to inspect the filters learned by convnets is to display the visual pattern that each filter is meant to respond to. This can be done with gradient ascent in input space : applying   to the value of the input image of a convnet so as maximize to    the  response  of  a  specific  filter,  starting  from  a  blank  input  image.  The resulting input image will be one that the chosen filter is maximally responsive to.  gradient descent  The process is simple: you’ll build a loss function that maximizes the value of a given filter  in  a  given  convolution  layer,  and  then  you’ll  use  stochastic  gradient  descent  to adjust the values of the input image so as to maximize this activation value. For instance, here’s  a  loss  for  the  activation  of  filter  1  in  the  layer    of  the  VGG16 network, pretrained on ImageNet.  block3_conv1  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  154   Listing 5.33 Defining the loss tensor for filter visualization  library keras  K <- backend    model <- application_vgg16    weights = "imagenet",   include_top = FALSE    layer_name <- "block3_conv1" filter_index <- 1  NOTE  layer_output <- get_layer model, layer_name $output loss <- K$mean layer_output[,,,filter_index]   Using the Keras backend In  the  code  above  we  get  a  reference  to  the  Keras  backend  with  the statement    then  subsequently  use  it  in  the  statement  K$mean layer_output[,,,filter_index]   . What is the Keras backend?  K  <-  backend    Keras is a model-level library, providing high-level building blocks for developing  deep  learning  models.  It  does  not  handle  itself  low-level operations such as tensor products, convolutions and so on. Instead, it relies  on  a  specialized,  well-optimized  tensor  manipulation  library  to  do so, serving as the “backend engine” of Keras.  Some  operations  in  Keras  require  interfacing  directly  with  the functions in the backend engine, and the statement   gives us access to those functions. Note that when a backend function expects an integer value you need to ensure that the R type is "integer" rather than "double"  e.g. pass    rather than   . 1  K <- backend    1L  You can find additional documntation on available backend functions . keras.rstudio.com articles backend.html  at  To implement gradient descent, you’ll need the gradient of this loss with respect to  function packaged with the   gradients  the model’s input. To do this, you’ll use the  backend   module of Keras.  Listing 5.34 Obtaining the gradient of the loss with regard to the input  grads <- K$gradients loss, model$input [[1]]  The call to gradients returns an R list of tensors  of size 1 in this case . Hence you keep only the first element—which is a tensor.  A non-obvious trick to use to help the gradient-descent process go smoothly is to normalize the gradient tensor by dividing it by its L2 norm  the square root of the average of the square of the values in the tensor . This ensures that the magnitude of the updates done to the input image is always within a same range.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  155   Listing 5.35 Gradient-normalization trick  grads <- grads    K$sqrt K$mean K$square grads    + 1e-5   Add 1e-5 before dividing to avoid accidentally dividing by 0.  Now you need a way to compute the value of the loss tensor and the gradient tensor, given an input image. You can define a Keras backend function to do this:   is a function that takes a tensor  as a list of tensors of size 1  and returns a list of two tensors: the loss value and the gradient value.  iterate  Listing 5.36 Fetching output values given input values  iterate <- K$`function` list model$input , list loss, grads    c loss_value, grads_value  %<-%     iterate list array 0, dim = c 1, 150, 150, 3      At this point, you can define an R loop to do stochastic gradient ascent.  Listing 5.37 Loss maximization via stochastic gradient descent  input_img_data <-   array runif 150 * 150 * 3 , dim = c 1, 150, 150, 3   * 20 + 128  step <- 1  for  i in 1:40  {    c loss_value, grads_value  %<-% iterate list input_img_data      input_img_data <- input_img_data +  grads_value * step  }  Starts from a gray image with some noise Runs gradient ascent for 40 steps Computes the loss value and gradient value Adjusts the input image in the direction that maximizes the loss  The resulting image tensor is a floating-point tensor of shape   ,  1, 150, 150, 3  with values that may not be integers within [0, 255]. Hence you need to post-process this tensor to turn it into a displayable image. You do so with the following straightforward utility function.  Listing 5.38 Utility function to convert a tensor into a valid image  deprocess_image <- function x  {    dms <- dim x   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  156     x <- x - mean x     x <- x    sd x  + 1e-5    x <- x * 0.1    x <- x + 0.5    x <- pmax 0, pmin x, 1      array x, dim = dms  }  Normalizes the tensor: centers on 0., ensures that std is 0.1 Clips to [0, 1] Reshape to original image dimensions  Now you have all the pieces. Let’s put them together into an R function that takes as input a layer name and a filter index, and returns a valid image tensor representing the pattern that maximizes the activation of the specified filter.  Listing 5.39 Function to generate filter visualizations  generate_pattern <- function layer_name, filter_index, size = 150  {    layer_output <- model$get_layer layer_name $output   loss <- K$mean layer_output[,,,filter_index]     grads <- K$gradients loss, model$input [[1]]    grads <- grads    K$sqrt K$mean K$square grads    + 1e-5     iterate <- K$`function` list model$input , list loss, grads        array runif size * size * 3 , dim = c 1, size, size, 3   * 20 + 128    input_img_data <-    step <- 1    for  i in 1:40  {     c loss_value, grads_value  %<-% iterate list input_img_data       input_img_data <- input_img_data +  grads_value * step    }    img <- input_img_data[1,,,]   deprocess_image img  }  Builds a loss function that maximizes the activation of the nth filter of the layer under consideration Computes the gradient of the input picture with regard to this loss Normalization trick: normalizes the gradient Returns the loss and grads given the input picture Starts from a gray image with some noise Runs gradient ascent for 40 steps  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  157   Let’s try it  see figure 5.25 :  > library grid  > grid.raster generate_pattern "block3_conv1", 1    Figure 5.25 Pattern that the 1st channel in layer block3_conv1 responds to maximally  block3_conv1   is responsive to a polka-dot pattern.

It also allows you to locate specific objects in an image.  class  activation  map  This  general  category  of  techniques  is  called      CAM  visualization, and it consists of producing heatmaps of class activation over input images. A class-activation heatmap is a 2D grid of scores associated with a specific output class, computed for every location in any input image, indicating how important each location is with respect to the class under consideration. For instance, given an image fed into a cat-versus-dog  convnet,  CAM  visualization  allows  you  to  generate  a  heatmap  for  the class "cat," indicating how cat-like different parts of the image are, and also a heatmap for the class "dog," indicating how dog-like parts of the image are.  The specific implementation you’ll use is the one described in "Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization." . It’s very simple: it consists of taking the output feature map of a convolution layer, given an input image, and weighing every channel in that feature map by the gradient of the class with respect to the channel. Intuitively, one way to understand this trick is that you’re weighting a spatial  map  of  "how  intensely  the  input  image  activates  different  channels"  by  "how important each channel is with regard to the class," resulting in a spatial map of "how intensely the input image activates the class."  9  Footnote 9mRamprasaath R.

Convnets work by learning a hierarchy of modular patterns and concepts to represent the visual world. The representations they learn are easy to inspect—convnets the opposite of black boxes! You’re now capable of training your own convnet from scratch to solve an image-classification problem. You understand how to use visual data augmentation to fight overfitting. You know how to use a pretrained convnet to do feature extraction and fine-tuning. You can generate visualizations of the filters learned by your convnets, as well as heatmaps of class activity.

The  two  fundamental  deep-learning  algorithms  for  sequence  processing  are  recurrent neural networks , the one-dimensional version of the 2D convnets that we  covered  in  the  previous  chapters.  We’ll  discuss  both  of  these  approaches  in  this chapter.  1D convnets   and   Applications of these algorithms include the following:  Document classification and timeseries classification, such as identifying the topic of an article or the author of a book Timeseries comparisons, such as estimating how closely related two documents or two stock tickers are Sequence-to-sequence learning, such as decoding an English sentence into French Sentiment analysis, such as classifying the sentiment of tweets or movie reviews as positive or negative Timeseries forecasting, such as predicting the future weather at a certain location, given recent weather data  This chapter’s examples will focus on two narrow tasks: sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset, a task we approached earlier in the book, and weather forecasting. But the techniques we’ll demonstrate for these two tasks are relevant to all the applications we just listed, and many more.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  167   6.1 Working with text data  Text is one of the most widespread forms of sequence data. It can be understood as either a sequence of characters or a sequence of words, but it’s most common to work at the level of words. The deep-learning sequence-processing models that we’ll introduce in the following  sections  can  use  text  to  produce  a  basic  form  of  natural  language understanding,  sufficient  for  applications  including  document  classification,  sentiment analysis, author identification, and even answering questions  in a constrained context . Of course, keep in mind throughout this chapter that none of these deep-learning models truly  understand  text  in  a  human  sense;  rather,  these  models  can  map  the  statistical structure  of  written  language,  which  is  sufficient  to  solve  many  simple  textual  tasks. Deep learning for natural-language processing is pattern recognition applied to words, sentences,  and  paragraphs,  in  much  the  same  way  that  computer  vision  is  pattern recognition applied to pixels.  Like all other neural networks, deep-learning models don’t take as input raw text:  text is the process of transforming text  they only work with numeric tensors.  into numeric tensors. This can be done in multiple ways:  Vectorizing  Segment text into words, and transform each word into a vector. Segment text into characters, and transform each character into a vector. Extract N-grams of words or characters, and transform each N-gram into a vector.  N-grams   are overlapping groups of multiple consecutive words or characters.  tokens  Collectively,  the  different  units  into  which  you  can  break  down  text   words, characters, or N-grams  are called  , and breaking text into such tokens is called  tokenization .  All  text-vectorization  processes  consist  of  applying  some  tokenization scheme and then associating numeric vectors with the generated tokens. These vectors, packed into sequence tensors, are fed into deep neural networks. There are multiple ways to associate a vector with a token. In this section, we’ll present two major ones: one-hot encoding    typically  used  exclusively  for  words,  and  .  The  remainder  of  this  section  explains  these  techniques  and called  shows how to use them to go from raw text to a tensor that you can send to a Keras network.  token  embedding  word  embedding    of  tokens,  and   Figure 6.1 From text to tokens to vectors  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  168   NOTE  Understanding N-grams and bag-of-words Word N-grams are groups of    or fewer  consecutive words that you can extract  from  a  sentence.  The  same  concept  may  also  be  applied  to characters instead of words.  N  Here’s a simple example. Consider the sentence "The cat sat on the  mat". It may be decomposed into the following set of 2-grams:  {"The", "The cat", "cat", "cat sat", "sat",   "sat on", "on", "on the", "the", "the mat", "mat"}  It may also be decomposed into the following set of 3-grams:  {"The", "The cat", "cat", "cat sat", "The cat sat",   "sat", "sat on", "on", "cat sat on", "on the", "the",   "sat on the", "the mat", "mat", "on the mat"}  bag-of-2-grams  ,  respectively. Such  a  set  is  called  a  The  term    of tokens rather than a list or sequence: the tokens have no specific order. This family of tokenization methods is called     here  refers  to  the  fact  that  you’re  dealing  with  a   bag-of-3-grams  . bag-of-words  bag    or   set  Because bag-of-words isn’t an order-preserving tokenization method  the tokens generated are understood as a set, not a sequence, and the general structure of the sentences is lost , it tends to be used in shallow language-processing  models  rather  than  in  deep-learning  models. Extracting N-grams is a form of feature engineering, and deep learning does  away  with  this  kind  of  rigid,  brittle  approach,  replacing  it  with hierarchical  feature  learning.  One-dimensional  convnets  and  recurrent neural networks, introduced later in this chapter, are capable of learning representations  for  groups  of  words  and  characters  without  being explicitly told about the existence of such groups, by looking at continuous word  or  character  sequences.  For  this  reason,  we  won’t  be  covering N-grams  any  further  in  this  book.  But  do  keep  in  mind  that  they’re  a powerful,  unavoidable  feature-engineering  tool  when  using  lightweight, shallow text-processing models such as logistic regression and random forests.  6.1.1 One-hot encoding of words and characters  One-hot encoding is the most common, most basic way to turn a token into a vector. You saw it in action in the initial IMDB and Reuters examples in chapter 3  done with words, in that case . It consists of associating a unique integer index with every word and then N turning this integer index   into a binary vector of size    the size of the vocabulary ; the vector is all zeros except for the _i_th entry, which is 1.  i  Of  course,  one-hot  encoding  can  be  done  at  the  character  level,  as  well.  To unambiguously drive home what one-hot encoding is and how to implement it, listings 6.1 and 6.2 show two toy examples: one for words, the other for characters.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  169   Listing 6.1 Word-level one-hot encoding  toy example   samples <- c "The cat sat on the mat.", "The dog ate my homework."   token_index <- list   for  sample in samples     for  word in strsplit sample, " " [[1]]      if  !word %in% names token_index          token_index[[word]] <- length token_index  + 2  max_length <- 10  results <- array 0, dim = c length samples ,                             max_length,                              max as.integer token_index      for  i in 1:length samples   {   sample <- samples[[i]]   words <- head strsplit sample, " " [[1]], n = max_length    for  j in 1:length words   {     index <- token_index[[words[[j]]]]     results[[i, j, index]] <- 1   } }  Initial data: one entry per sample  in this example, a sample is a sentence, but it could be an entire document  Builds an index of all tokens in the data Tokenizes the samples via the strsplit function. In real life, you’d also strip punctuation and special characters from the samples. Assigns a unique index to each unique word. Note that you don’t attribute index 1 to anything. Vectorizes the samples. You’ll only consider the first max_length words in each sample. This is where you store the results.

You  should  use  these  utilities, because  they  take  care  of  a  number  of  important  features  such  as  stripping  special characters from strings and only taking into account the   most common words in your dataset  a common restriction, to avoid dealing with very large input vector spaces .

Vectorization modes other than one-hot encoding are supported by this tokenizer. How you can recover the word index that was computed  one-hot hashing trick  A variant of one-hot encoding is the so-called   , which you can use  when  the  number  of  unique  tokens  in  your  vocabulary  is  too  large  to  handle explicitly. Instead of explicitly assigning an index to each word and keeping a reference of these indices in a dictionary, you can hash words into vectors of fixed size. This is typically  done  with  a  very  lightweight  hashing  function.  The  main  advantage  of  this method  is  that  it  does  away  with  maintaining  an  explicit  word  index,  which  saves memory and allows online encoding of the data  you can generate token vectors right away, before you’ve seen all of the available data . The one drawback of this approach is that it’s susceptible to  : two different words may end up with the same hash, and subsequently any machine-learning model looking at these hashes won’t be able  to  tell  the  difference  between  these  words.  The  likelihood  of  hash  collisions decreases  when  the  dimensionality  of  the  hashing  space  is  much  larger  than  the  total number of unique tokens being hashed.  hash collisions  Listing 6.4 Word-level one-hot encoding with hashing trick  toy example   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  171   samples <- c "The cat sat on the mat.", "The dog ate my homework."   library hashFunction   dimensionality <- 1000  max_length <- 10  results <- array 0, dim = c length samples , max_length, dimensionality    for  i in 1:length samples   {   sample <- samples[[i]]   words <- head strsplit sample, " " [[1]], n = max_length    for  j in 1:length words   {      index <- abs spooky.32 words[[i]]   %% dimensionality      results[[i, j, index]] <- 1   } }  Stores the words as vectors of size 1,000. If you have close to 1,000 words  or more , you’ll see many hash collisions, which will decrease the accuracy of this encoding method. Use hashFunction::spooky.32   to hash the word into a random integer index between 0 and 1,000  6.1.2 Using word embeddings  ,  also  called   word  embeddings  Another popular and powerful way to associate a vector with a word is the use of dense  word  vectors .  Whereas  the  vectors  obtained  through one-hot encoding are binary, sparse  mostly made of zeros , and very high-dimensional  same dimensionality as the number of words in the vocabulary , word embeddings are low-dimensional  floating-point  vectors   that  is,  dense  vectors,  as  opposed  to  sparse vectors ; see figure 6.2. Unlike the word vectors obtained via one-hot encoding, word embeddings  are  learned  from  data.  It’s  common  to  see  word  embeddings  that  are 256-dimensional, 512-dimensional, or 1,024-dimensional when dealing with very large vocabularies. On the other hand, one-hot encoding words generally leads to vectors that are 20,000-dimensional or greater  capturing a vocabulary of 20,000 token, in this case . So, word embeddings pack more information into far fewer dimensions.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  172   Figure 6.2 Whereas word representations obtained from one-hot encoding or hashing are sparse, high-dimensional, and hardcoded, word embeddings are dense, relatively low-dimensional, and learned from data.  There are two ways to obtain word embeddings:  Learn word embeddings jointly with the main task you care about  such as document classification or sentiment prediction . In this setup, you start with random word vectors and then learn word vectors in the same way you learn the weights of a neural network. Load into your model word embeddings that were precomputed using a different machine-learning task than the one you’re trying to solve. These are called pretrained word embeddings  .  Let’s look at both.  LEARNING WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH AN EMBEDDING LAYER The  simplest  way  to  associate  a  dense  vector  with  a  word  is  to  choose  the  vector  at random. The problem with this approach is that the resulting embedding space has no structure:  for  instance,  the  words    may  end  up  with  completely different  embeddings,  even  though  they’re  interchangeable  in  most  sentences.  It’s difficult  for  a  deep  neural  network  to  make  sense  of  such  a  noisy,  unstructured embedding space.  accurate    and   exact  To get a bit more abstract, the geometric relationships between word vectors should reflect the semantic relationships between these words. Word embeddings are meant to map human language into a geometric space. For instance, in a reasonable embedding space, you would expect synonyms to be embedded into similar word vectors; and in general, you would expect the geometric distance  such as L2 distance  between any two  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  173   word  vectors  to  relate  to  the  semantic  distance  between  the  associated  words   words meaning  different  things  are  embedded  at  points  far  away  from  each  other,  whereas related words are closer . In addition to distance, you may want specific   in the embedding  space  to  be  meaningful.  To  make  this  clearer,  let’s  look  at  a  concrete example.  directions  In figure 6.3, four words are embedded on a 2D plane,   . With the  vector  representations  we  chose  here,  some  semantic  relationships  between  these words can be encoded as geometric transformations. For instance, the same vector allows : this vector could be interpreted as the us to go from  "from pet to wild animal" vector. Similarly, another vector lets us go from   and from   to  , which could be interpreted as a "from canine to feline" vector.  cat dog wolf   and from   , and   tiger  tiger  tiger  wolf  wolf  dog  dog   to    to    to   cat  cat  ,   ,   Figure 6.3 A toy example of a word-embedding space  In real-world word-embedding spaces, common examples of meaningful geometric transformations  are  "gender"  vectors  and  "plural"  vectors.  For  instance,  by  adding  a "female" vector to the vector "king", we obtain the vector "queen". By adding a "plural" vector, we obtain "kings". Word-embedding spaces typically feature thousands of such interpretable and potentially useful vectors.  human language  Is there some ideal word-embedding space that would perfectly map human language and could be used for any natural language-processing task? Possibly, but we have yet to compute anything of the sort. Also, there is no such a thing as  —there are  many  different  languages,  and  they  aren’t  isomorphic,  because  a  language  is  the reflection  of  a  specific  culture  and  a  specific  context.  But  more  pragmatically,  what makes  a  good  word-embedding  space  depends  heavily  on  your  task:  the  perfect word-embedding space for an English-language movie-review sentiment-analysis model may  look  different  from  the  perfect  embedding  space  for  an  English-language legal-document-classification  model,  because  the  importance  of  certain  semantic relationships varies from task to task. learn    a  new  embedding  space  with  every  new  task. Fortunately, backpropagation makes this easy, and Keras makes it even easier. It’s about learning the weights of a layer using layer_embedding  It’s  thus  reasonable  to   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  174   Listing 6.5 Instantiating an embedding layer  embedding_layer <- layer_embedding input_dim = 1000, output_dim = 64   The embedding layer takes at least two arguments: the number of possible tokens   here, 1,000  and the dimensionality of the embeddings  here, 64 .  A   layer_embedding    is  best  understood  as  a  dictionary  that  maps  integer  indices  which stand for specific words  to dense vectors. It takes integers as input, it looks up these  integers  in  an  internal  dictionary,  and  it  returns  the  associated  vectors.  It’s effectively a dictionary lookup  see figure 6.4 .  Figure 6.4 An embedding layer   32,  10     batch of 32 sequences of length 10  or   An  embedding  layer  takes  as  input  a  2D  tensor  of  integers,  of  shape   samples, , where each entry is a sequence of integers. It can embed sequences sequence_length  of variable lengths: for instance, you could feed into the embedding layer in the previous example batches with shapes   64,   batch of 64 sequences of length 15 . All sequences in a batch must have the same 15  length, though  because you need to pack them into a single tensor , so sequences that are shorter than others should be padded with zeros, and sequences that are longer should be truncated. This   tensor,  of  shape   samples, .  Such  a  3D  tensor  can  then  be sequence_length,  embedding_dimensionality  processed by an RNN layer or a 1D convolution layer  both will be introduced in the following sections .  returns  a  3D   floating-point   layer   When you instantiate an embedding layer, its weights  its internal dictionary of token vectors  are initially random, just as with any other layer. During training, these word vectors are gradually adjusted via backpropagation, structuring the space into something the downstream model can exploit. Once fully trained, the embedding space will show a lot of structure—a kind of structure specialized for the specific problem for which you were training your model.  Let’s apply this idea to the IMDB movie-review sentiment-prediction task that you’re already  familiar  with.  First,  you’ll  quickly  prepare  the  data.  You’ll  restrict  the  movie reviews to the top 10,000 most common words  as you did the first time you worked with this  dataset   and  cut  off  the  reviews  after  only  20  words.  The  network  will  learn 8-dimensional embeddings for each of the 10,000 words, turn the input integer sequences  2D integer tensor  into embedded sequences  3D float tensor , flatten the tensor to 2D, and train a single dense layer on top for classification.  Listing 6.6 Loading the IMDB data for use with an embedding layer  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  175   max_features <- 10000  maxlen <- 20  imdb <- dataset_imdb num_words = max_features   c c x_train, y_train , c x_test, y_test   %<-% imdb  x_train <- pad_sequences x_train, maxlen = maxlen  x_test <- pad_sequences x_test, maxlen = maxlen   Number of words to consider as features Cuts off the text after this number of words  among the max_features most common words  Loads the data as lists of integers Turns the lists of integers into a 2D integer tensor of shape  samples, maxlen   Listing 6.7 Using an embedding layer and classifier on the IMDB data  model  %    layer_embedding input_dim = 10000, output_dim = 8,                   input_length = maxlen  %>%    layer_flatten   %>%    layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "acc"     summary model   history  % fit    x_train, y_train,   epochs = 10,   batch_size = 32,   validation_split = 0.2    Specifies the maximum input length to the embedding layer so you can later flatten the embedded inputs.

But note that merely flattening the embedded sequences and training a single dense layer on top leads to a model that treats  each  word  in  the  input  sequence  separately,  without  considering  inter-word relationships and sentence structure  for example, this model would likely treat both "this movie is a bomb" and "this movie is the bomb" as being negative reviews . It’s much  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  176   better  to  add  recurrent  layers  or  1D  convolutional  layers  on  top  of  the  embedded sequences to learn features that take into account each sequence as a whole. That’s what we’ll focus on in the next few sections.  USING PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS Sometimes, you have so little training data available that you can’t use your data alone to learn an appropriate task-specific embedding of your vocabulary. What do you do then?  Instead of learning word embeddings jointly with the problem you want to solve, you can  load  embedding  vectors  from  a  precomputed  embedding  space  that  you  know  is highly  structured  and  exhibits  useful  properties—that  captures  generic  aspects  of language  structure.  The  rationale  behind  using  pretrained  word  embeddings  in  natural language  processing  is  much  the  same  as  for  using  pretrained  convnets  in  image classification: you don’t have enough data available to learn truly powerful features on your  own,  but  you  expect  the  features  that  you  need  to  be  fairly  generic—that  is, common visual features or semantic features. In this case, it makes sense to reuse features learned on a different problem.  Such  word  embeddings  are  generally  computed  using  word-occurrence  statistics  observations about what words co-occur in sentences or documents , using a variety of techniques,  some  involving  neural  networks,  others  not.  The  idea  of  a  dense, low-dimensional  embedding  space  for  words,  computed  in  an  unsupervised  way,  was initially explored by Bengio et al. in the early 2000s,  but it only started to take off in research  and  industry  applications  after  the  release  of  one  of  the  most  famous  and successful  word-embedding  schemes:    code.google.com archive p word2vec  , developed by Tomas Mikolov at Google in 2013. Word2vec dimensions capture specific semantic properties, such as gender.  the  Word2vec   algorithm   10  Footnote 10mYoshua Bengio et al.,   Neural Probabilistic Language Models    Springer, 2003 .  There are various precomputed databases of word embeddings that you can download and use in a Keras embedding layer. Word2vec is one of them. Another popular one is called Global Vectors for Word Representation  GloVe,  nlp.stanford.edu projects glove  , which  was  developed  by  Stanford  researchers  in  2014.  This  embedding  technique  is based on factorizing a matrix of word co-occurrence statistics. Its developers have made available  precomputed  embeddings  for  millions  of  English  tokens,  obtained  from Wikipedia data and Common Crawl data.  Let’s look at how you can get started using GloVe embeddings in a Keras model. The same  method  will  of  course  be  valid  for  Word2vec  embeddings  or  any  other word-embedding database. You’ll also use this example to refresh the text-tokenization techniques we introduced a few paragraphs ago: you’ll start from raw text and work your way up.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  177   6.1.3 Putting it all together: from raw text to word embeddings  You’ll be using a model similar to the one we just went over: embedding sentences in sequences of vectors, flattening them, and training a dense layer on top. But you’ll do so using  pretrained  word  embeddings;  and  instead  of  using  the  pretokenized  IMDB  data packaged in Keras, you’ll start from scratch by downloading the original text data.  DOWNLOADING THE IMDB DATA AS RAW TEXT First, head to  ai.stanford.edu ~amaas data sentiment  if the URL isn’t working anymore, Google "IMDB dataset" . Uncompress it.   and download the raw IMDB dataset  Now, let’s collect the individual training reviews into a list of strings, one string per  review. You’ll also collect the review labels  positive   negative  into a   labels   list.  Listing 6.8 Processing the labels of the raw IMDB data  imdb_dir <- "~ Downloads aclImdb" train_dir <- file.path imdb_dir, "train"   labels <- c   texts <- c    for  label_type in c "neg", "pos"   {   label <- switch label_type, neg = 0, pos = 1    dir_name <- file.path train_dir, label_type    for  fname in list.files dir_name, pattern = glob2rx "*.txt" ,                            full.names = TRUE   {     texts <- c texts, readChar fname, file.info fname $size       labels <- c labels, label    } }  TOKENIZING THE DATA Let’s vectorize the text and prepare a training and validation split, using the concepts we introduced earlier in this section. Because pretrained word embeddings are meant to be particularly  useful  on  problems  where  little  training  data  is  available   otherwise, task-specific embeddings are likely to outperform them , we’ll add the following twist: restricting  the  training  data  to  the  first  200  samples.  So  you’ll  be  learning  to  classify movie reviews after looking at just 200 examples.  Listing 6.9 Tokenizing the text of the raw IMDB data  library keras   maxlen <- 100  training_samples <- 200  validation_samples <- 10000  max_words <- 10000  tokenizer  %   fit_text_tokenizer texts   sequences <- texts_to_sequences tokenizer, texts   word_index = tokenizer$word_index  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  178   cat "Found", length word_index , "unique tokens.\n"   data <- pad_sequences sequences, maxlen = maxlen   labels <- as.array labels  cat "Shape of data tensor:", dim data , "\n"  cat 'Shape of label tensor:', dim labels , "\n"   indices <- sample 1:nrow data   training_indices <- indices[1:training_samples] validation_indices <- indices[ training_samples + 1 :                                  training_samples + validation_samples ]  x_train <- data[training_indices,] y_train <- labels[training_indices]  x_val <- data[validation_indices,] y_val <- labels[validation_indices]  Cuts off reviews after 100 words Trains on 200 samples Validates on 10,000 samples Considers only the top 10,000 words in the dataset Splits the data into a training set and a validation set. But first shuffles the data, because you’re starting with data in which samples are ordered  all negative first, then all positive .  nlp.stanford.edu projects glove  DOWNLOADING THE GLOVE WORD EMBEDDINGS Go to  , and download the precomputed embeddings from 2014  English  Wikipedia.  It’s  a  822  MB  zip  file  called  glove.6B.zip,  containing 100-dimensional embedding vectors for 400,000 words  or nonword tokens . Unzip it.  PREPROCESSING THE EMBEDDINGS Let’s parse the unzipped file  a .txt file  to build an index that maps words  as strings  to their vector representation  as number vectors .  Listing 6.10 Parsing the GloVe word-embeddings file  glove_dir = '~ Downloads glove.6B' lines <- readLines file.path glove_dir, "glove.6B.100d.txt"    embeddings_index <- new.env hash = TRUE, parent = emptyenv    for  i in 1:length lines   {   line <- lines[[i]]   values <- strsplit line, " " [[1]]   word <- values[[1]]   embeddings_index[[word]] <- as.double values[-1]  }  cat "Found", length embeddings_index , "word vectors.\n"   Next, you’ll build an embedding matrix that you can load into an embedding layer. It , where each entry   contains -dimensional vector for the word of index   in the reference word  must be a matrix of shape  the    max_words, embedding_dim   embedding_dim  i  i  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  179   index  built during tokenization . Note that index 1 isn’t supposed to stand for any word or token—it’s a placeholder.  Listing 6.11 Preparing the GloVe word-embeddings matrix  embedding_dim <- 100  embedding_matrix <- array 0, c max_words, embedding_dim    for  word in names word_index   {   index <- word_index[[word]]   if  index < max_words  {     embedding_vector <- embeddings_index[[word]]     if  !is.null embedding_vector          embedding_matrix[index+1,] <- embedding_vector   } }  Words not found in the embedding index will be all zeros.  DEFINING A MODEL You’ll use the same model architecture as before.  Listing 6.12 Model definition  model  %   layer_embedding input_dim = max_words, output_dim = embedding_dim,                   input_length = maxlen  %>%   layer_flatten   %>%   layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   summary model   LOADING THE GLOVE EMBEDDINGS IN THE MODEL The embedding layer has a single weight matrix: a 2D float matrix where each entry   isi the word vector meant to be associated with index  . Simple enough. Load the GloVe matrix you prepared into the embedding layer, the first layer in the model.  i  Listing 6.13 Loading pretrained word embeddings into the embedding layer  get_layer model, index = 1  %>%   set_weights list embedding_matrix   %>%   freeze_weights    Additionally, you’ll freeze the weights of the embedding layer, following the same rationale you’re already familiar with in the context of pretrained convnet features: when parts  of  a  model  are  pretrained   like  your  embedding  layer   and  parts  are  randomly initialized  like your classifier , the pretrained parts shouldn’t be updated during training, to avoid forgetting what they already know. The large gradient updates triggered by the randomly initialized layers would be disruptive to the already-learned features.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  180   TRAINING AND EVALUATING THE MODEL Compile and train the model.  Listing 6.14 Training and evaluation  model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "acc"     history  % fit    x_train, y_train,   epochs = 20,   batch_size = 32,   validation_data = list x_val, y_val     save_model_weights_hdf5 model, "pre_trained_glove_model.h5"   Now, plot the model’s performance over time  see figure 6.5 .  Listing 6.15 Plotting the results  plot history   Figure 6.5 Training and validation metrics when using pretrained word embeddings  The model quickly starts overfitting, which is unsurprising given the small number of training samples. Validation accuracy has high variance for the same reason, but it seems to reach the high 50s.  Note  that  your  mileage  may  vary:  because  you  have  so  few  training  samples, performance is heavily dependent on exactly which 200 samples you choose—and you’re  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  181   choosing them at random. If this works poorly for you, try choosing a different random set of 200 samples, for the sake of the exercise  in real life, you don’t get to choose your training data .  You can also train the same model without loading the pretrained word embeddings and without freezing the embedding layer. In that case, you’ll be learning a task-specific embedding of the input tokens, which is generally more powerful than pretrained word embeddings when lots of data is available. But in this case, you have only 200 training samples. Let’s try it  see figure 6.6 .  Listing 6.16 Training the same model without pretrained word embeddings  model  %   layer_embedding input_dim = max_words, output_dim = embedding_dim,                   input_length = maxlen  %>%   layer_flatten   %>%   layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "acc"     history  % fit    x_train, y_train,   epochs = 20,   batch_size = 32,   validation_data = list x_val, y_val     Figure 6.6 Training and validation metrics without using pretrained word embeddings  Validation accuracy stalls in the mid 50s. So in this case, pretrained word embeddings outperform jointly learned embeddings. If you increase the number of training samples,  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  182   this will quickly stop being the case—try it as an exercise.  Finally, let’s evaluate the model on the test data. First, you need to tokenize the test  data.  Listing 6.17 Tokenizing the data of the test set  test_dir <- file.path imdb_dir, "test"   labels <- c   texts <- c    for  label_type in c "neg", "pos"   {   label <- switch label_type, neg = 0, pos = 1    dir_name <- file.path test_dir, label_type    for  fname in list.files dir_name, pattern = glob2rx "*.txt" ,                            full.names = TRUE   {     texts <- c texts, readChar fname, file.info fname $size       labels <- c labels, label    } }  sequences <- texts_to_sequences tokenizer, texts  x_test <- pad_sequences sequences, maxlen = maxlen  y_test <- as.array labels   Next, load and evaluate the first model.  Listing 6.18 Evaluating the model on the test set  model %>%   load_model_weights_hdf5 "pre_trained_glove_model.h5"  %>%   evaluate x_test, y_test   You get an appalling test accuracy of 58%. Working with just a handful of training  samples is difficult!  6.1.4 Wrapping up  Now you’re able to do the following:  Turn raw text into something a neural network can process Use an embedding layer in a Keras model to learn task-specific token embeddings Use pretrained word embeddings to get an extra boost on small natural-language-processing problems  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  183   6.2 Understanding recurrent neural networks  A  major  characteristic  of  all  neural  networks  you’ve  seen  so  far,  such  as  densely connected networks and convnets, is that they have no memory. Each input shown to them  is  processed  independently,  with  no  state  kept  in  between  inputs.  With  such networks, in order to process a sequence or a temporal series of data points, you have to show the entire sequence to the network at once: that is, turn it into a single data point. For instance, this is what you did in the IMDB example: an entire movie review was transformed into a single large vector and processed in one go. Such networks are called  feedforward networks  .  In  contrast,  as  you’re  reading  the  present  sentence,  you’re  processing  it  word  by word—or rather, eye saccade by eye saccade—while keeping memories of what came before; this gives you a fluid representation of the meaning we’re conveying with this sentence. Biological intelligence processes information incrementally while maintaining an  internal  model  of  what  it’s  processing,  built  from  past  information  and  constantly updated as new information comes in.  A   state  recurrent neural network    RNN  adopts the same principle, albeit in an extremely simplified version: it processes sequences by iterating through the sequence elements and maintaining a   containing information relative to what it has seen so far. In effect, an RNN is a type of neural network that has an internal loop  see figure 6.9 . The state of the RNN  is  reset  between  processing  two  different,  independent  sequences   such  as  two different IMDB reviews , so you still consider one sequence a single data point: a single input to the network. What changes is that this data point is no longer processed in a single step; rather, the network internally loops over sequence elements.  Figure 6.7 A recurrent network: a network with a loop  loop  state   and   To make these notions of    clear, let’s implement the forward pass of a toy RNN in R. This RNN takes as input a sequence of vectors, which you’ll encode as a . It loops over timesteps, and at each 2D tensor of size  timestep,  it  considers  its  current  state  at    and  the  input  at     of  shape  . You’ll then set the  input_features   , and combines them to obtain the output at    timesteps, input_features   t  t  t  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  184   state  for  the  next  step  to  be  this  previous  output.  For  the  first  timestep,  the  previous output isn’t defined; hence there is no current state. So, you’ll initialize the state as an all-zero vector called the    of the network.  initial state In pseudocode, this is the RNN:  Listing 6.19 Pseudocode RNN  state_t = 0  for  input_t in input_sequence  {   output_t <- f input_t, state_t     state_t <- output_t }  The state at t Iterates over sequence elements The previous output becomes the new state.  You can even flesh out the function   f  an output will be parametrized by two matrices,  the transformation operated by a densely connected layer in a feedforward network.  U  W  : the transformation of the input and state into , and a bias vector. It’s similar to   and   Listing 6.20 More detailed pseudocode for the RNN  state_t <- 0 for  input_t in input_sequence  {   output_t <- activation dot W, input_t  + dot U, state_t  + b    state_t <- output_t }  To make these notions absolutely unambiguous, let’s write a naive R implementation  of the forward pass of the simple RNN.  Listing 6.21 R implementation of a simple RNN  timesteps <- 100  input_features <- 32  output_features <- 64  random_array <- function dim  {   array runif prod dim  , dim = dim  }  inputs <- random_array dim = c timesteps, input_features    state_t <- rep_len 0, length = c output_features    W <- random_array dim = c output_features, input_features    U <- random_array dim = c output_features, output_features    b <- random_array dim = c output_features, 1    Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  185   output_sequence <- array 0, dim = c timesteps, output_features   for  i in 1:nrow inputs   {    input_t <- inputs[i,]    output_t <- tanh as.numeric  W %*% input_t  +  U %*% state_t  + b      output_sequence[i,] <- as.numeric output_t     state_t <- output_t }  Number of timesteps in the input sequence Dimensionality of the input feature space Dimensionality of the output feature space Input data: random noise for the sake of the example Initial state: an all-zero vector Creates random weight matrices input_t is a vector of shape  input_features . Combines the input with the current state  the previous output  to obtain the current output Updates the result matrix Updates the state of the network for the next timestep  Easy enough: in summary, an RNN is a    loop that reuses quantities computed during  the  previous  iteration  of  the  loop.  Nothing  more.  Of  course,  there  are  many different RNNs fitting this definition that you could build—this example is one of the simplest RNN formulations. RNNs are characterized by their step function, such as the following function in this case  see figure 6.8 :  for  output_t <- tanh as.numeric  W %*% input_t  +  U %*% state_t  + b    Figure 6.8 A simple RNN, unrolled over time  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  186   NOTE  In  this  example,  the  final  output  is  a  2D  tensor  of  shape   timesteps, , where each timestep is the output of the loop at time  output_features  t   in  the  output  tensor  contains  information  about .  Each  timestep  t timesteps   in the input sequence—about the entire past. For this t reason, in many cases, you don’t need this full sequence of outputs; you just  need  the  last  output      at  the  end  of  the  loop ,  because  it already contains information about the entire sequence.  output_t   to   1  6.2.1 A recurrent layer in Keras  The process you just naively implemented in R corresponds to an actual Keras layer— layer_simple_rnn  .  layer_simple_rnn units = 32   There is one minor difference:    processes batches of sequences, like all other Keras layers, not a single sequence as in the R example. This means it takes inputs  of  shape  ,  rather  than   timesteps, input_features    batch_size,  timesteps,  input_features   layer_simple_rnn  .  layer_simple_rnn  Like all recurrent layers in Keras,    can be run in two different modes: it can return either the full sequences of successive outputs for each timestep  a 3D tensor of shape    or only the last tensor  of  shape   batch_size, output  for  each  return_sequences output_features  constructor argument.

Unfortunately,  this  small  recurrent  network  doesn’t  perform  well compared to this baseline  only 84% validation accuracy . Part of the problem is that your inputs only consider the first 500 words, rather than full sequences—hence the RNN has  access  to  less  information  than  the  earlier  baseline  model.  The  remainder  of  the problem is that   isn’t good at processing long sequences, such as text. Other types of recurrent layers perform much better. Let’s look at some more advanced layers.  layer_simple_rnn    and   layer_simple_rnn  Simple RNNs aren’t the only recurrent layers available in Keras. There are two others:  .  In  practice,  you’ll  always  use  one  of  these,  because  layer_gru layer_lstm  is generally too simplistic to be of real use. One major issue with   is that although it should theoretically be able to retain at time  layer_simple_rnn t information  about  inputs  seen  many  timesteps  before,  in  practice,  such  long-term dependencies are impossible to learn. This is due to the  , an effect  that  is  similar  to  what  is  observed  with  non-recurrent  networks   feedforward networks  that are many layers deep: as you keep adding layers to a network, the network eventually becomes untrainable. The theoretical reasons for this effect were studied by Hochreiter, Schmidhuber, and Bengio in the early 1990s.  layers are designed to solve this problem.  vanishing gradient problem   The    and   LSTM  GRU  11  Footnote 11mSee, for example, Yoshua Bengio, Patrice Simar, and Paolo Frasconi, "Learning Long-Term  5, no. 2  1994 .

Imagine  a  conveyor  belt  running parallel to the sequence you’re processing. Information from the sequence can jump onto the conveyor belt at any point, be transported to a later timestep, and jump off, intact, when you need it. This is essentially what LSTM does: it saves information for later, thus preventing older signals from gradually vanishing during processing.  To understand this in detail, let’s start from the simple RNN cell  see figure 6.10 .  matrices in the cell  Because you’ll have a lot of weight matrices, you’ll index the  with the letter   output     o Wo    for    and    and   Uo  U  W  .  Figure 6.10 The starting point of an LSTM layer: a simple RNN  Let’s  add  to  this  picture  an  additional  data  flow  that  carries  information  across timesteps. You’ll call its values at different timesteps  . This information will have the following impact on the cell: it will be combined with the input connection and the recurrent connection  via a dense transformation: a dot product with a weight matrix followed by a bias add and the application of an activation function , and it will  affect  the  state  being  sent  to  the  next  timestep   via  an  activation  function  an  a multiplication operation . Conceptually, the carry dataflow is a way to modulate the next output and the next state  see figure 6.11 .

It  involves three distinct transformations. All three have the form of a simple RNN cell:  y = activation dot state_t, U  + dot input_t, W  + b   But all three transformations have their own weight matrices, which you’ll index with .

For  instance,  you  can  say  that  multiplying  f_t deliberately forget irrelevant information in the carry dataflow. Meanwhile,  i_t k_t provide information about the present, updating the carry track with new information. But at the end of the day, these interpretations don’t mean much, because what these operations   do is determined by the contents of the weights parametrizing them; and the weights are learned in an end-to-end fashion, starting over with each training round, making it impossible to credit this or that operation with a specific purpose. The specification of a RNN cell  as we just described  determines your hypothesis space—the space  in  which  you’ll  search  for  a  good  model  configuration  during  training—but  it doesn’t determine what the cell does; that is up to the cell weights. The same cell with different weights can be doing very different things. So the combination of operations making up a RNN cell is better interpreted as set of   on your search, not as a  design   in an engineering sense.  constraints  To a researcher, it seems that the choice of such constraints—the question of how to implement RNN cells—is better left to optimization algorithms  like genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning processes  than to human engineers. And in the future, that’s how we’ll build networks. In summary: you don’t need to understand anything about the specific architecture of an LSTM cell; as a human, it shouldn’t be your job to understand it. Just keep in mind what the LSTM cell is meant to do: allow past information to be reinjected at a later time, thus fighting the vanishing-gradient problem.  6.2.3 A concrete LSTM example in Keras  Now let’s switch to more practical concerns: you’ll set up a model using  layer_lstm and train it on the IMDB data  see figure 6.13 . The network is similar to the one with   that we just presented. You only specify the output dimensionality layer_simple_rnn of the  ; leave every other argument  there are many  at the Keras defaults. Keras has good defaults, and things will almost always "just work" without you having to spend time tuning parameters by hand.  layer_lstm  Listing 6.27 Using the LSTM layer in Keras  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  193   model  %   layer_embedding input_dim = max_features, output_dim = 32  %>%   layer_lstm units = 32  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "acc"     history  % fit    input_train, y_train,   epochs = 10,   batch_size = 128,   validation_split = 0.2    Figure 6.13 Training and validation metrics on IMDB with LSTM  This time, you achieve up to 88% validation accuracy. Not bad: certainly much better than the simple RNN network—that’s largely because LSTM suffers much less from the vanishing-gradient problem—and even slightly better than the fully connected approach from  chapter  3,  even  though  you’re  looking  at  less  data  than  you  were  in  chapter  3. You’re  truncating  sequences  after  500  timesteps,  whereas  in  chapter  3,  you  were considering full sequences.  But this result isn’t groundbreaking for such a computationally intensive approach. Why  isn’t  LSTM  performing  better?  One  reason  is  that  you  made  no  effort  to  tune hyperparameters  such  as  the  embeddings  dimensionality  or  the  LSTM  output dimensionality. Another may be lack of regularization.

But   there  are   6.2.4 Wrapping up  Now you understand the following:  What RNNs are and how they work What LSTM is, and why it works better on long sequences than a naive RNN How to use Keras RNN layers to process sequence data  Next, we’ll review a number of more advanced features of RNNs, which can help you  get the most out of your deep-learning sequence models.  6.3 Advanced use of recurrent neural networks  In this section, we’ll review three advanced techniques for improving the performance and generalization power of recurrent neural networks. By the end of the section, you’ll know most of what there is to know about using recurrent networks with Keras. We’ll demonstrate all three concepts on a weather-forecasting problem, where you have access to a timeseries of data points coming from sensors installed on the roof of a building, such  as  temperature,  air  pressure,  and  humidity,  which  you  use  to  predict  what  the temperature will be 24 hours after the last data point. This is a fairly challenging problem that exemplifies many common difficulties encountered when working with timeseries.  We’ll cover the following techniques:  Recurrent dropout—This is a specific, built-in way to use dropout to fight overfitting in recurrent layers. Stacking recurrent layers—This increases the representational power of the network  at the cost of higher computational loads . Bidirectional recurrent layers—These present the same information to a recurrent network in different ways, increasing accuracy and mitigating forgetting issues.  6.3.1 A temperature-forecasting problem  Until now, the only sequence data we’ve covered has been text data, such as the IMDB dataset and the Reuters dataset. But sequence data is found in many more problems than just language processing. In all the examples in this section, you’ll be playing with a weather timeseries dataset recorded at the Weather Station at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany.13 Footnote 13mOlaf Kolle, www.bgc-jena.mpg.de wetter.  In  this  dataset,  14  different  quantities   such  air  temperature,  atmospheric  pressure, humidity, wind direction, and so on  were recorded every 10 minutes, over several years. The original data goes back to 2003, but this example is limited to data from 2009–2016.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  195   This dataset is perfect for learning to work with numerical timeseries. You’ll use it to build a model that takes as input some data from the recent past  a few days' worth of data points  and predicts the air temperature 24 hours in the future.

Also  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  197   note that this 10-day period must be coming from a fairly cold winter month.  If you were trying to predict average temperature for the next month given a few months of past data, the problem would be easy, due to the reliable year-scale periodicity of the data. But looking at the data over a scale of days, the temperature looks a lot more chaotic. Is this timeseries predictable at a daily scale? Let’s find out.  6.3.2 Preparing the data   timesteps  a timestep is 10 minutes  and sampled every   The exact formulation of the problem will be as follows: given data going as far back as   timesteps, can lookback you  predict  the  temperature  in    timesteps?  You’ll  use  the  following  parameter values:  delay  steps  lookback = 720—Observations will go back 5 days. steps = 6—Observations will be sampled at one data point per hour. delay = 144—Targets will be 24 hours in the future.  To get started, you need to do two things:  Preprocess the data to a format a neural network can ingest. This is easy: the data is already numerical, so you don’t need to do any vectorization. But each timeseries in the data is on a different scale  for example, temperature is typically between -20 and +30, but pressure, measured in mbar, is around 1,000 . You’ll normalize each timeseries independently so that they all take small values on a similar scale. Write a generator function that takes the current array of float data and yields batches of data from the recent past, along with a target temperature in the future. Because the samples in the dataset are highly redundant  sample   will have most of their timesteps in common , it would be wasteful to explicitly allocate every sample. Instead, you’ll generate the samples on the fly using the original data.   and sample   N + 1  N  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  198   NOTE  Understanding generator functions A generator function is a special type of function that you call repeatedly to obtain a sequence of values from. Often generators need to maintain internal  state,  so  they  are  typically  constructed  by  calling  another  yet another function which returns the generator function  the environment of the function which returns the generator is then used to track state .  For  example,  the   sequence_generator      function  below  returns  a  generator function that yields an infinite sequence of numbers:  sequence_generator <- function start  {   value <- start - 1   function   {     value <<- value + 1     value   } }  > gen <- sequence_generator 10  > gen   [1] 10 > gen   [1] 11  The  current  state  of  the  generator  is  the  outside of the function.

You’re going to use the first 200,000 timesteps as training data, so compute the mean and standard deviation for normalization only on this fraction of the data.

It will serve as a sanity check, and it will establish a baseline that you’ll have to beat in order to demonstrate  the  usefulness  of  more  advanced  machine-learning  models.  Such common-sense  baselines  can  be  useful  when  you’re  approaching  a  new  problem  for which  there  is  no  known  solution   yet .  A  classic  example  is  that  of  unbalanced classification  tasks,  where  some  classes  are  much  more  common  than  others.  If  your dataset  contains  90%  instances  of  class  A  and  10%  instances  of  class  B,  then  a common-sense  approach  to  the  classification  task  is  to  always  predict  "A"  when presented  with  a  new  sample.  Such  a  classifier  is  90%  accurate  overall,  and  any learning-based approach should therefore beat this 90% score in order to demonstrate usefulness. Sometimes, such elementary baselines can prove surprisingly hard to beat.  In this case, the temperature timeseries can safely be assumed to be continuous  the temperatures  tomorrow  are  likely  to  be  close  to  the  temperatures  today   as  well  as periodical with a daily period. Thus a common-sense approach is to always predict that the temperature 24 hours from now will be equal to the temperature right now. Let’s evaluate this approach, using the mean absolute error  MAE  metric:  Listing 6.35 Computing the common-sense baseline MAE  mean abs preds - targets    Here’s the evaluation loop.  evaluate_naive_method <- function   {   batch_maes <- c     for  step in 1:val_steps  {     c samples, targets  %<-% val_gen       preds <- samples[,dim samples [[2]],2]     mae <- mean abs preds - targets       batch_maes <- c batch_maes, mae    }   print mean batch_maes   }  evaluate_naive_method    This yields an MAE of 0.29. Because the temperature data has been normalized to be centered  on  0  and  have  a  standard  deviation  of  1,  this  number  isn’t  immediately interpretable.  It  translates  to  an  average  absolute  error  of  0.29  *  temperature_std degrees Celsius: 2.57C.  Listing 6.36 Converting the MAE back to a Celsius error  celsius_mae <- 0.29 * std[[2]]  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  202   That’s a fairly large average absolute error. now the game is to use your knowledge of  deep learning to do better.  6.3.4 A basic machine-learning approach  In  the  same  way  that  it’s  useful  to  establish  a  common-sense  baseline  before  trying machine-learning approaches, it’s useful to try simple, cheap machine-learning models  such  as  small,  densely  connected  networks   before  looking  into  complicated  and computationally expensive models such as RNNs. This is the best way to make sure any further complexity you throw at the problem is legitimate and delivers real benefits.  The following listing shows a fully connected model that starts by flattening the data and then runs it through two dense layers. Note the lack of activation function on the last dense layer, which is typical for a regression problem. You use MAE as the loss. Because you’re evaluating on the exact same data and with the exact same metric you did with the common-sense approach, the results will be directly comparable.  Listing 6.37 Training and evaluating a densely connected model  library keras   model  %   layer_flatten input_shape = c lookback   step, dim data [-1]   %>%   layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 1   model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop  ,   loss = "mae"    history  % fit_generator    train_gen,   steps_per_epoch = 500,   epochs = 20,   validation_data = val_gen,   validation_steps = val_steps    Listing 6.38 Plotting results  plot history   Let’s display the loss curves for validation and training  see figure 6.16 .  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  203   Figure 6.16 Training and validation loss on the Jena temperature forecasting task with a simple, densely connected network  Some of the validation losses are close to the no-learning baseline, but not reliably. This goes to show the merit of having this baseline in the first place: it turns out to be not easy to outperform. Your common sense contains a lot of valuable information that a machine-learning model doesn’t have access to.  You may wonder, if a simple, well-performing model exists to go from the data to the targets  the common-sense baseline , why doesn’t the model you’re training find it and improve on it? Because this simple solution isn’t what your training setup is looking for. The space of models in which you’re searching for a solution—that is, your hypothesis space—is  the  space  of  all  possible  two-layer  networks  with  the  configuration  you defined.  These  networks  are  already  fairly  complicated.  When  you’re  looking  for  a solution with a space of complicated models, the simple, well-performing baseline may be  unlearnable,  even  if  it’s  technically  part  of  the  hypothesis  space.  That  is  a  pretty significant  limitation  of  machine  learning  in  general:  unless  the  learning  algorithm  is hard-coded  to  look  for  a  specific  kind  of  simple  model,  parameter  learning  can sometimes fail to find a simple solution to a simple problem.  6.3.5 A first recurrent baseline  The first fully connected approach didn’t do well, but that doesn’t mean machine learning isn’t  applicable  to  this  problem.  The  previous  approach  consisted  first  flattened  the timeseries, which removed the notion of time from the input data. Let’s instead look at the  data  as  what  it  is:  a  sequence,  where  causality  and  order  matter.  You’ll  try  a recurrent-sequence processing model—it should be the perfect fit for such sequence data, precisely  because  it  exploits  the  temporal  ordering  of  data  points,  unlike  the  first approach.  Instead of the LSTM layer introduced in the previous section, you’ll use the GRU  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  204   14  layer,  developed  by  Chung  et  al.  in  2014.   Gated  recurrent  unit   GRU   layers  work using the same principle as LSTM, but they’re somewhat streamlined and thus cheaper to run   although  they  may  not  have  as  much  representational  power  as  LSTM .  This trade-off  between  computational  expensiveness  and  representational  power  is  seen everywhere in machine learning.

Much  better!  You  can  significantly  beat  the common-sense  baseline,  demonstrating  the  value  of  machine  learning  as  well  as  the superiority of recurrent networks compared to sequence-flattening dense networks on this type of task.  Figure 6.17 Training and validation loss on the Jena temperature-forecasting task with layer_gru  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  205   The  new  validation  MAE  of  ~0.265   before  you  start  significantly  overfitting  translates to a mean absolute error of 2.35C after denormalization. That’s a solid gain on the initial error of 2.57C, but you probably still have a bit of a margin for improvement.  6.3.6 Using recurrent dropout to fight overfitting  It’s  evident  from  the  training  and  validation  curves  that  the  model  is  overfitting:  the training and validation losses start to diverge considerably after a few epochs. You’re already familiar with a classic technique for fighting this phenomenon: dropout, which randomly zeros out input units of a layer in order to break happenstance correlations in the  training  data  that  the  layer  is  exposed  to.  But  how  to  correctly  apply  dropout  in recurrent networks isn’t a trivial question. It has long been known that applying dropout before a recurrent layer hinders learning rather than helping with regularization. In 2015, Yarin Gal, as part of his Ph.D. thesis on Bayesian deep learning,  determined the proper way to use dropout with a recurrent network: the same dropout mask  the same pattern of dropped units  should be applied at every timestep, instead of a dropout mask that varies randomly  from  timestep  to  timestep.  What’s  more,  in  order  to  regularize  the representations  formed  by  the  recurrent  gates  of  layers  such  as    and  , a temporally constant dropout mask should be applied to the inner recurrent layer_lstm activations  of  the  layer   a    dropout  mask .  Using  the  same  dropout  mask  at every timestep allows the network to properly propagate its learning error through time; a temporally random dropout mask would disrupt this error signal and be harmful to the learning process.  recurrent  layer_gru  15  Footnote 15mSee Yarin Gal, "Uncertainty in Deep Learning  PhD Thesis ," October 13, 2016,  mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk yarin blog_2248.html  .  Yarin Gal did his research using Keras and helped build this mechanism directly into Keras recurrent layers. Every recurrent layer in Keras has two dropout-related arguments: ,  a  float  specifying  the  dropout  rate  for  input  units  of  the  layer,  and  dropout ,  specifying  the  dropout  rate  of  the  recurrent  units.  Let’s  add recurrent_dropout dropout  and  recurrent  dropout  to  the    and  see  how  it  impacts  overfitting. Because networks being regularized with dropout always take longer to fully converge, you’ll train the network for twice as many epochs.  layer_gru  Listing 6.40 Training and evaluating a dropout-regularized GRU-based model  model  %   layer_gru units = 32, dropout = 0.2, recurrent_dropout = 0.2,             input_shape = list NULL, dim data [[-1]]   %>%   layer_dense units = 1   model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop  ,   loss = "mae"    history  % fit_generator    train_gen,  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  206     steps_per_epoch = 500,   epochs = 40,   validation_data = val_gen,   validation_steps = val_steps    Figure 6.18 shows the results. Success! You’re no longer overfitting during the first 20 epochs. But although you have more stable evaluation scores, your best scores aren’t much lower than they were previously.  Figure 6.18 Training and validation loss on the Jena temperature forecasting task with a dropout-regularized GRU  6.3.7 Stacking recurrent layers  Because you’re no longer overfitting but seem to have hit a performance bottleneck, you should  consider  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  network.  Recall  our  description  of  the universal machine-learning workflow: it’s generally a good idea to increase the capacity of your network until overfitting becomes the primary obstacle  assuming you’re already taking basic steps to mitigate overfitting, such as using dropout . As long as you aren’t overfitting too badly, you’re likely under capacity.  Increasing network capacity is typically done by increasing the number of units in the layers or adding more layers. Recurrent layer stacking is a classic way to build more powerful recurrent networks: for instance, what currently powers the Google Translate algorithm is a stack of seven large LSTM layers—that’s huge.  To stack recurrent layers on top of each other in Keras, all intermediate layers should return  their  full  sequence  of  outputs   a  3D  tensor   rather  than  their  output  at  the  last timestep. This is done by specifying   return_sequences = TRUE  .  Listing 6.41 Training and evaluating a dropout-regularized, stacked GRU model  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  207   model  %   layer_gru units = 32,             dropout = 0.1,             recurrent_dropout = 0.5,             return_sequences = TRUE,             input_shape = list NULL, dim data [[-1]]   %>%   layer_gru units = 64, activation = "relu",             dropout = 0.1,             recurrent_dropout = 0.5  %>%   layer_dense units = 1   model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop  ,   loss = "mae"    history  % fit_generator    train_gen,   steps_per_epoch = 500,   epochs = 40,   validation_data = val_gen,   validation_steps = val_steps    Figure 6.19 shows the results. You can see that the added layer does improve the  results a bit, though not significantly. You can draw two conclusions:  Because you’re still not overfitting too badly, you could safely increase the size of your layers in a quest for validation loss improvement. This has a non-negligible computational cost, though. Adding a layer didn’t help by a significant factor, so you may be seeing diminishing returns from increasing network capacity at this point.  Figure 6.19 Training and validation loss on the Jena temperature forecasting task with a stacked GRU network  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  208   6.3.8 Using bidirectional RNNs  The  last  technique  we’ll  introduce  in  this  section  is  called  .  A bidirectional RNN is common RNN variant that can offer greater performance than a regular RNN on certain tasks. It’s frequently used in natural language processing—you could call it the Swiss Army knife of deep learning for natural language processing.  bidirectional  RNNs  RNNs are notably order dependent, or time dependent: they process the timesteps of their input sequences in order, and shuffling or reversing the timesteps can completely change  the  representations  the  RNN  extracts  from  the  sequence.  This  is  precisely  the reason  they  perform  well  on  problems  where  order  is  meaningful,  such  as  the temperature-forecasting problem. A bidirectional RNN exploits the order sensitivity of RNNs: it consists of using two regular RNNs, such as the  layer_lstm you’re already familiar with, each of which processes the input sequence in one direction  chronologically  and  antichronologically ,  and  then  merging  their  representations.  By processing a sequence both ways, a bidirectional RNN can catch patterns that may be overlooked by a one-direction RNN.  layer_gru   and   Remarkably, the fact that the RNN layers in this section have processed sequences in chronological order  older timesteps first  may have been an arbitrary decision. At least, it’s a decision we made no attempt to question so far. Could the RNNs have performed well enough if they processed input sequences in antichronological order, for instance  newer timesteps first ? Let’s try this in practice and see what happens. All you need to do is write a variant of the data generator where the input sequences are reverted along the  time  dimension   replace  the  last  line  with  list samples[,ncol samples :1,],  .  Training  the  same  one-GRU-layer  network  that  you  used  in  the  first targets  experiment in this section, you get the results shown in figure 6.20.  Figure 6.20 Training and validation loss on the Jena temperature forecasting task with a GRU trained on reversed sequences  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  209   The reversed-order GRU underperforms even the common-sense baseline, indicating that in this case, chronological processing is important to the success of your approach. This  makes  perfect  sense:  the  underlying  GRU  layer  will  typically  be  better  at remembering the recent past than the distant past, and naturally the more recent weather data points are more predictive than older data points for the problem  that’s what makes the common-sense baseline fairly strong . Thus the chronological version of the layer is bound  to  outperform  the  reversed-order  version.  Importantly,  this  isn’t  true  for  many other  problems,  including  natural  language:  intuitively,  the  importance  of  a  word  in understanding a sentence isn’t usually dependent on its position in the sentence. Let’s try the same trick on the LSTM IMDB example from section 6.2.  Listing 6.42 Training and evaluating an LSTM using reversed sequences  library keras   max_features <- 10000  maxlen <- 500  imdb <- dataset_imdb num_words = max_features  c c x_train, y_train , c x_test, y_test   %<-% imdb  x_train <- lapply x_train, rev  x_test <- lapply x_test, rev   x_train <- pad_sequences x_train, maxlen = maxlen  x_test <- pad_sequences x_test, maxlen = maxlen   model  %   layer_embedding input_dim = max_features, output_dim = 128  %>%   layer_lstm units = 32  %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "acc"     history  % fit    x_train, y_train,   epochs = 10,   batch_size = 128,   validation_split = 0.2    Number of words to consider as features Cuts off texts after this number of words  among the max_features most common words  Reverses sequences Pads sequences  You  get  performance  nearly  identical  to  that  of  the  chronological-order  LSTM. Remarkably,  on  such  a  text  dataset,  reversed-order  processing  works  just  as  well  as  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  210   which  chronological  processing,  confirming  the  hypothesis  that,  although  word  order  does matter  in  understanding  language,    order  you  use  isn’t  crucial.  Importantly,  an RNN trained on reversed sequences will learn different representations than one trained on  the  original  sequences,  much  as  you  would  have  different  mental  models  if  time flowed backward in the real world—if you lived a life where you died on your first day and were born on your last day. In machine learning, representations that are   yet useful  are always worth exploiting, and the more they differ, the better: they offer a new angle from which to look at your data, capturing aspects of the data that were missed by other approaches, and thus can help boost performance on a task. This is the intuition behind  , a concept we’ll introduce in chapter 7.  ensembling  different  A  bidirectional  RNN  exploits  this  idea  to  improve  on  the  performance  of chronological-order RNNs. It looks at its input sequence both ways  see figure 6.25 , obtaining potentially richer representations and capturing patterns that may have been missed by the chronological-order version alone.  Figure 6.21 How a bidirectional RNN layer works   function, To instantiate a bidirectional RNN in Keras, you use the  which takes a recurrent layer instance as an argument. The   function creates  a  second,  separate  instance  of  this  recurrent  layer  and  uses  one  instance  for processing  the  input  sequences  in  chronological  order  and  the  other  instance  for processing  the  input  sequences  in  reversed  order.  Let’s  try  it  on  the  IMDB sentiment-analysis task.  bidirectional    bidirectional    Listing 6.43 Training and evaluating a bidirectional LSTM  model  %   layer_embedding input_dim = max_features, output_dim = 32  %>%   bidirectional      layer_lstm units = 32      %>%   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "acc"   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  211      history  % fit    x_train, y_train,   epochs = 10,   batch_size = 128,   validation_split = 0.2    It performs slightly better than the regular LSTM you tried in the previous section, achieving over 89% validation accuracy. It also seems to overfit more quickly, which is unsurprising  because  a  bidirectional  layer  has  twice  as  many  parameters  as  a chronological LSTM. With some regularization, the bidirectional approach would likely be a strong performer on this task.  Now let’s try the same approach on the weather-prediction task.  Listing 6.44 Training a bidirectional GRU  model  %   bidirectional      layer_gru units = 32 , input_shape = list NULL, dim data [[-1]]      %>%   layer_dense units = 1   model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop  ,   loss = "mae"    history  % fit_generator    train_gen,   steps_per_epoch = 500,   epochs = 40,   validation_data = val_gen,   validation_steps = val_steps    This performs about as well as the regular   . It’s easy to understand why: all the predictive capacity must come from the chronological half of the network, because the anti-chronological half is known to be severely underperforming on this task  again, because the recent past matters much more than the distant past in this case .  layer_gru  6.3.9 Going even further  There  are  many  other  things  you  could  try,  in  order  to  improve  performance  on  the weather-forecasting problem:  layer_lstm  Adjust the number of units in each recurrent layer in the stacked setup. The current choices are largely arbitrary and thus probably suboptimal.

We can provide guidelines that tell you what is likely to work or not work on a given problem, but, ultimately, every problem  is  unique;  you’ll  have  to  evaluate  different  strategies  empirically.  There  is currently  no  theory  that  will  tell  you  in  advance  precisely  what  you  should  do  to optimally solve a problem. You must iterate.  6.3.10 Wrapping up  Here’s what you should take away from this section:  As you first learned in chapter 4, when approaching a new problem, it’s good to first establish common-sense baselines for your metric of choice. If you don’t have a baseline to beat, you can’t tell whether you’re making real progress. Try simple models before expensive ones, to justify the additional expense. Sometimes a simple model will turn out to be your best option. When you have data where temporal ordering matters, recurrent networks are a great fit and easily outperform models that first flatten the temporal data. To use dropout with recurrent networks, you should use a time-constant dropout mask and recurrent dropout mask. These are built into Keras recurrent layers, so all you have to do is use the  Stacked RNNs provide more representational power than a single RNN layer. They’re also much more expensive and thus not always worth it. Although they offer clear gains on complex problems  such as machine translation , they may not always be relevant to smaller, simpler problems.

But they aren’t strong performers on sequence data where the recent past is much more informative than the beginning of the sequence.   arguments of recurrent layers.  recurrent_dropout  dropout   and   NOTE  SIDEBAR  There are two important concepts we won’t cover in detail here: recurrent attention and sequence masking.

We’ll  leave  them  for  future  study outside of this book.  Markets and machine learning Some readers are bound to want to take the techniques we’ve introduced here and try them on the problem of forecasting the future price of securities on the stock market  or currency exchange rates, and so on . Markets have    than  natural  phenomena  such  as very  different  statistical  characteristics weather patterns.

The same properties that make convnets excel at computer vision also make them highly relevant to sequence processing. Time can be treated as a spatial dimension, like the height or width of a 2D image.  Such  1D  convnets  can  be  competitive  with  RNNs  on  certain  sequence-processing problems, usually at a considerably cheaper computational cost. Recently, 1D convnets, typically  used  with  dilated  kernels,  have  been  used  with  great  success  for  audio generation and machine translation. In addition to these specific successes, it has long been known that small 1D convnets can offer a fast alternative to RNNs for simple tasks such as text classification and timeseries forecasting.  6.4.1 Understanding 1D convolution for sequence data  The convolution layers we introduced previously were 2D convolutions, extracting 2D patches from image tensors and applying an identical transformation to every patch. In the same way, you can use 1D convolutions, extracting local 1D patches  subsequences  from sequences  see figure 6.26 .  Figure 6.22 How 1D convolution works: each output timestep is obtained from a temporal patch in the input sequence.  Such 1D convolution layers can recognize local patterns in a sequence. Because the same  input  transformation  is  performed  on  every  patch,  a  pattern  learned  at  a  certain position in a sentence can later be recognized at a different position, making 1D convnets translation invariant  for temporal translations . For instance, a 1D convnet processing sequences  of  characters  using  convolution  windows  of  size  5  should  be  able  to  learn  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  214   words or word fragments of length 5 or less, and it should be able to recognize these words in any context in an input sequence. A character-level 1D convnet is thus able to learn about word morphology.  6.4.2 1D pooling for sequence data  You’re already familiar with 2D pooling operations, such as 2D average pooling and max pooling,  used  in  convnets  to  spatially  downsample  image  tensors.  The  2D  pooling operation has a 1D equivalent: extracting 1D patches  subsequences  from an input and outputting the maximum value  max pooling  or average value  average pooling . Just as with 2D convnets, this is used for reducing the length of 1D inputs    subsampling   .  6.4.3 Implementing a 1D convnet   function, which has an interface layer_conv_2d  samples,  time,  and returns similarly shaped 3D tensors. The convolution window is a 1D  In Keras, you use a 1D convnet via the  similar to  features  window on the temporal axis: the second axis in the input tensor.  . It takes as input 3D tensors with shape   layer_conv_1d  Let’s  build  a  simple  two-layer  1D  convnet  and  apply  it  to  the  IMDB sentiment-classification task you’re already familiar with. As a reminder, this is the code for obtaining and preprocessing the data.  Listing 6.45 Preparing the IMDB data  library keras   max_features <- 10000 max_len <- 500  cat "Loading data...\n"  imdb <- dataset_imdb num_words = max_features  c c x_train, y_train , c x_test, y_test   %<-% imdb cat length x_train , "train sequences\n"  cat length x_test , "test sequences"   cat "Pad sequences  samples x time \n"  x_train <- pad_sequences x_train, maxlen = max_len  x_test <- pad_sequences x_test, maxlen = max_len  cat "x_train shape:", dim x_train , "\n"  cat "x_test shape:", dim x_test , "\n"   1D convnets are structured in the same way as their 2D counterparts, which you used , in chapter 5: they consist of a stack of  layer_max_pooling_1d ending in either a global pooling layer or a  , that turn the 3D outputs into 2D outputs, allowing you to add one or more dense layers to the model for classification or regression.  layer_conv_1d  layer_flatten   and   One  difference,  though,  is  the  fact  that  you  can  afford  to  use  larger  convolution windows with 1D convnets. With a 2D convolution layer, a 3 × 3 convolution window contains  3  *  3  =  9  feature  vectors;  but  with  a  1D  convolution  layer,  a  convolution window  of  size  3  contains  only  3  feature  vectors.  You  can  thus  easily  afford  1D convolution windows of size 7 or 9.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  215   This is the example 1D convnet for the IMDB dataset.  Listing 6.46 Training and evaluating a simple 1D convnet on the IMDB data  model  %   layer_embedding input_dim = max_features, output_dim = 128,                   input_length = max_len  %>%   layer_conv_1d filters = 32, kernel_size = 7, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_max_pooling_1d pool_size = 5  %>%   layer_conv_1d filters = 32, kernel_size = 7, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_global_max_pooling_1d   %>%   layer_dense units = 1   summary model   model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop lr = 1e-4 ,   loss = "binary_crossentropy",   metrics = c "acc"     history  % fit    x_train, y_train,   epochs = 10,   batch_size = 128,   validation_split = 0.2    Figures  6.23  shows  the  training  and  validation  results.  Validation  accuracy  is somewhat less than that of the LSTM, but runtime is faster on both a CPU and a GPU  the exact increase in speed will vary greatly depending on your exact configuration . At this point, you could retrain this model for the right number of epochs  eight  and run it on the test set. This is a convincing demonstration that a 1D convnet can offer a fast, cheap alternative to a recurrent network on a word-level sentiment-classification task.

Of course, to recognize longer-term patterns, you can stack many convolution layers  and  pooling  layers,  resulting  in  upper  layers  that  will  see  long  chunks  of  the original inputs—but that’s still a fairly weak way to induce order sensitivity. One way to evidence this weakness is to try 1D convnets on the temperature-forecasting problem, where  order-sensitivity  is  key  to  producing  good  predictions.  The  following  example reuses the following variables defined previously:  , float_data train_gen val_gen and  val_steps  ,   ,   .  Listing 6.47 Training and evaluating a simple 1D convnet on the Jena data  model  %   layer_conv_1d filters = 32, kernel_size = 5, activation = "relu",                 input_shape = list NULL, dim data [[-1]]   %>%   layer_max_pooling_1d pool_size = 3  %>%   layer_conv_1d filters = 32, kernel_size = 5, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_max_pooling_1d pool_size = 3  %>%   layer_conv_1d filters = 32, kernel_size = 5, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_global_max_pooling_1d   %>%   layer_dense units = 1   model %>% compile    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop  ,   loss = "mae"    history  % fit_generator    train_gen,   steps_per_epoch = 500,   epochs = 20,   validation_data = val_gen,   validation_steps = val_steps    Figure 6.24 shows the training and validation MAEs.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  217   Figure 6.24 Training and validation loss on the Jena temperature-forecasting task with a simple 1D convnet  The  validation  MAE  stays  in  the  0.40s:  you  can’t  even  beat  the  common-sense baseline using the small convnet. Again, this is because the convnet looks for patterns anywhere in the input timeseries and has no knowledge of the temporal position of a pattern it sees   toward the beginning, toward the end, and so on . Because more recent data  points  should  be  interpreted  differently  from  older  datapoints  in  the  case  of  this specific  forecasting  problem,  the  convnet  fails  at  producing  meaningful  results.  This limitation of convnets isn’t an issue with the IMDB data, because patterns of keywords associated with a positive or negative sentiment are informative independently of where they’re found in the input sentences.  One strategy to combine the speed and lightness of convnets with the order-sensitivity of RNNs is to use a 1D convnet as a preprocessing step before a RNN  see figure 6.25 . This is especially beneficial when you’re dealing with sequences that are so long they can’t realistically be processed with RNNs, such as sequences with thousands of steps. The  convnet  will  turn  the  long  input  sequence  into  much  shorter   downsampled  sequences of higher-level features. This sequence of extracted features then becomes the input to the RNN part of the network.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  218   Figure 6.25 Combining a 1D convnet and an RNN for processing long sequences  This technique isn’t seen often in research papers and practical applications, possibly because it isn’t well known. It’s effective and ought to be more common. Let’s try it on the temperature-forecasting dataset. Because this strategy allows you to manipulate much longer  sequences,  you  can  either  look  at  data  from  longer  ago   by  increasing  the    parameter  of  the  data  generator   or  look  at  high-resolution  timeseries   by lookback decreasing the   parameter of the generator .

They offer a faster alternative to RNNs on some problems, in particular natural-language processing tasks. Typically, 1D convnets are structured much like their 2D equivalents from the world of computer vision: they consist of stacks of  , layer_max_pooling_1d layer_conv_1d ending in a global pooling operation or flattening operation. Because RNNs are extremely expensive for processing very long sequences, but 1D convnets are cheap, it can be a good idea to use a 1D convnet as a preprocessing step before a RNN, shortening the sequence and extracting useful representations for the RNN to process.   and   One useful and important concept that we won’t cover in these pages is that of 1D  convolution with dilated kernels.

Using the Keras functional API, you can build graph-like models, share a layer across different inputs, and use Keras models just like R functions. Keras callbacks and the TensorBoard browser-based visualization tool  let  you  monitor  models  during  training.  We’ll  also  discuss  several  other  best practices  including  batch  normalization,  residual  connections,  hyperparameter optimization, and model ensembling.  7.1 Going beyond the Sequential model: the Keras functional API  Until now, all neural networks introduced in this book have been implemented using the sequential  model   i.e.  .  The  sequential  model  makes  the assumption that the network has exactly one input and exactly one output, and that it consists of a linear stack of layers  see figure 7.1 .  keras_model_sequential  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  223   Figure 7.1 A Sequential model: a linear stack of layers   of layers rather than linear stacks of layers. multimodal  This is a commonly verified assumption; the configuration is so common that we’ve been able to cover many topics and practical applications in these pages so far using only  . But this set of assumptions is too inflexible in a number of keras_model_sequential cases. Some networks require several independent inputs, others require multiple outputs, and some networks have internal branching between layers that makes them look like  graphs  Some tasks, for instance, require    inputs: they merge data coming from different  input  sources,  processing  each  type  of  data  using  different  kinds  of  neural layers. Imagine a deep-learning model trying to predict the most likely market price of a second-hand piece of clothing, using the following inputs: user-provided metadata  such as the item’s brand, age, and so on , a user-provided text description, and a picture of the item.  If  you  had  only  the  metadata  available,  you  could  one-hot  encode  it  and  use  a densely  connected  network  to  predict  the  price.  If  you  had  only  the  text  description available, you could use an RNN or a 1D convnet. If you had only the picture, you could use a 2D convnet. But how can you use all three at the same time? A naive approach would  be  to  train  three  separate  models  and  then  do  a  weighted  average  of  their predictions. But this may be suboptimal, because the information extracted by the models may be redundant. A better way is to   learn a more accurate model of the data by using a model that can see all available input modalities simultaneously: a model with three input branches  see figure 7.2 .  jointly  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  224   Figure 7.2 A multi-input model  Similarly, some tasks need to predict multiple target attributes of input data. Given the text of a novel or short story, you might want to automatically classify it by genre  such  as  romance  or  thriller   but  also  predict  the  approximate  date  it  was  written.  Of course, you could train two separate models: one for the genre and one for the date. But because these attributes aren’t statistically independent, you could build a better model by learning to jointly predict both genre and date at the same time. Such a joint model would  then  have  two  outputs,  or     see  figure  7.3 .  Due  to  correlations  between genre and date, knowing the date of a novel would help the model learn rich, accurate representations of the space of novel genres, and vice versa.  heads  Figure 7.3 A multi-output  or multihead  model  16  Additionally, many recent neural architectures require nonlinear network topology: networks  structured  as  directed  acyclic  graphs.

But there is another far more general and flexible way to . This section explains in detail what it is, what it can do,  7.1.1 Introduction to the functional API  In the functional API, you build your input and output layers and then pass them to the  keras_model     function. This model can be trained just like Keras sequential models.  Let’s start with a minimal example that shows side by side a simple sequential model  and its equivalent in the functional API:  library keras   seq_model  %   layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu", input_shape = c 64   %>%   layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 10, activation = "softmax"   input_tensor <- layer_input shape = c 64   output_tensor  %   layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu"  %>%   layer_dense units = 10, activation = "softmax"   model <- keras_model input_tensor, output_tensor   summary model   Sequential model, which you already know about Its functional equivalent The keras_model   function turns an input tensor and output tensor into a model. Let’s look at it!  This is what the call to   summary model    displays:  _________________________________________________________________ Layer  type                  Output Shape              Param  ================================================================= input_1  InputLayer           None, 64                 0 _________________________________________________________________ dense_1  Dense                None, 32                 2080 _________________________________________________________________ dense_2  Dense                None, 32                 1056 _________________________________________________________________ dense_3  Dense                None, 10                 330 ================================================================= Total params: 3,466 Trainable params: 3,466 Non-trainable params: 0 _________________________________________________________________  The only part that may seem a bit magical at this point is passing only an input tensor  function. Behind the scenes, Keras retrieves , bringing them  and an output tensor to the  every layer involved in going from   output_tensor  keras_model    input_tensor   to   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  227   together into a graph-like data structure—a model. Of course, the reason it works is that  . If you tried to output_tensor build a model from inputs and outputs that weren’t related, you’d get an error:   was obtained by repeatedly transforming   input_tensor  > unrelated_input <- layer_input shape = c 64   > bad_model <- keras_model unrelated_input, output_tensor  RuntimeError: Graph disconnected: cannot obtain value for tensor [CA]Tensor "input_1:0", shape= ?, 64 , dtype=float32  at layer "input_1".  This error tells you, in essence, that Keras couldn’t reach   input_1   from the provided  output tensor.  When it comes to compiling, training, or evaluating such a model built this way, the  API is the same as that of sequential models:  model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "categorical_crossentropy"    x_train <- array runif 1000 * 64 , dim = c 1000, 64   y_train <- array runif 1000 * 10 , dim = c 1000, 10    model %>% fit x_train, y_train, epochs = 10, batch_size = 128   model %>% evaluate x_train, y_train   Compiles the model Generates dummy data to train on Trains the model for 10 epochs Evaluates the model  7.1.2 Multi-input models  The functional API can be used to build models that have multiple inputs. Typically, such models at some point merge their different input branches using a layer that can combine several tensors: by adding them, concatenating them, and so on. This is usually done via a Keras merge operation such as  , and so on. Let’s look at a very simple example of a multi-input model: a question-answering model.  layer_add layer_concatenate  ,   A typical question-answering model has two inputs: a natural-language question and a text snippet  such as a news article  providing information to be used for answering the question. The model must then produce an answer: in the simplest possible setup, this is a one-word answer obtained via a softmax over some predefined vocabulary  see figure 7.6 .  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  228   Figure 7.6 A question-answering model  Here is an example of how you can build such a model with the functional API. You set  up  two  independent  branches,  encoding  the  text  input  and  the  question  input  as representation  vectors;  then  concatenate  these  vectors;  and  finally,  add  a  softmax classifier on top of the concatenated representations.

There are two possible APIs: you can feed the model a list of arrays as inputs, or you can feed it a dictionary that maps input names to arrays. Naturally, the latter option is available only if you give names to your inputs.

But because gradient descent requires you to minimize a  , you must combine these losses into a single value in order to train the model. The simplest way to combine different losses is to sum them all. In Keras, you can use either a list or a named  list  of  losses  in    to  specify  different  objects  for  different  outputs;  the resulting loss values are summed into a global loss, which is minimized during training.  compile  scalar  Listing 7.4 Compilation options of a multi-output model: multiple losses  model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = c "mse", "categorical_crossentropy", "binary_crossentropy"     model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = list      age = "mse",     income = "categorical_crossentropy",     gender = "binary_crossentropy"        Equivalent  possible only if you give names to the output layers   Note that very imbalanced loss contributions will cause the model representations to be optimized preferentially for the task with the largest individual loss, at the expense of the other tasks. To remedy this, you can assign different levels of importance to the loss values  in  their  contribution  to  the  final  loss.  This  is  useful  in  particular  if  the  losses' values use different scales. For instance, the mean squared error  MSE  loss used for the age-regression  task  typically  takes  a  value  around  3–5,  whereas  the  crossentropy  loss used for the gender-classification task can be as low as 0.1. In such a situation, to balance the contribution of the different losses, you can assign a weight of 10 to the crossentropy loss and a weight of 0.25 to the MSE loss.

The most basic form of an Inception module has three to four branches starting with a 1 × 1 convolution, followed by a 3 × 3 convolution, and ending with the concatenation of the resulting  features.  This  setup  helps  the  network  separately  learn  spatial  features  and channel-wise features, which is more efficient than learning them jointly. More complex versions of an Inception module are also possible, typically involving pooling operations, different  spatial  convolution  sizes   for  example,  5  ×  5  instead  of  3  ×  3  on  some branches , and branches without a spatial convolution  only a 1 × 1 convolution . An example of such a module, taken from Inception V3, is shown in figure 7.8.

An edge case is when the patches extracted consist of a single tile. The convolution operation  then  becomes  equivalent  to  running  each  tile  vector  through  a dense layer: it will compute features that mix together information from the channels  of  the  input  tensor,  but  it  won’t  mix  information  across  space  because  it’s  looking  at  one  tile  at  a  time .  Such  1  ×  1  convolutions   also called    are featured in Inception modules, where they contribute  to  factoring  out  channel-wise  feature  learning  and  space-wise feature learning—a reasonable thing to do if you assume that each channel is  highly  auto-correlated  across  space  but  different  channels  may  not  be highly correlated with each other.  pointwise convolutions  Here is how you’d implement the module featured in 7.7 using the functional API.

RESIDUAL CONNECTIONS Residual  connections  are  a  common  graph-like  network  component  found  in  many post-2015 network architectures, including Xception. They were introduced by He et al from Microsoft in their winning entry in the ILSVRC ImageNet challenge in late 2015.20 They  tackle  two  common  problems  that  plague  any  large-scale  deep-learning  model: vanishing  gradients  and  representational  bottlenecks.  In  general,  adding  residual connections to any model that has more than 10 layers is likely to be beneficial.  Footnote 20mIbid.  A residual connection consists of making the output of an earlier layer available as input to a later layer, effectively creating a shortcut in a sequential network  see figure 7.9 . Rather than being concatenated to the later activation, the earlier output is summed with the later activation, which assumes that both activations are the same size. If they’re sizes, you can use a linear transformation to reshape the earlier activation into the target shape   for  example,  a  dense  layer  without  an  activation  or,  for  convolutional  feature maps, a 1 × 1 convolution without an activation .

If one layer is too small  for example, it has  features  that  are  too  low-dimensional ,  then  the  model  will  be constrained by how much information can be crammed into the activations of this layer. You  can  think  of  it  with  a  signal-processing  analogy:  if  you  have  an audio-processing  pipeline  that  consists  of  a  series  of  operations,  each  of which  takes  as  input  the  output  of  the  previous  operation,  then  if  one operation  crops  your  signal  to  a  low-frequency  range   for  example,  0–15 kHz , the operations downstream will never be able to recover the dropped frequencies. Any loss of information is permanent. Residual connections, by reinjecting  earlier  information  downstream,  partially  solve  this  issue  for deep-learning models.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  237   SIDEBAR  Vanishing gradients in deep learning Backpropagation, the master algorithm used to train deep neural networks, works by propagating a feedback signal from the output loss down to earlier layers. If this feedback signal has to be propagated through a deep stack of layers, the signal may become tenuous or even be lost entirely, rendering the network untrainable. This issue is known as  This problem occurs both with deep networks and with recurrent networks over  very  long  sequences—in  both  cases,  a  feedback  signal  must  be propagated through a long series of operations. You’re already familiar with the solution that the LSTM layer uses to address this problem in recurrent networks: it introduces a   that propagates information in parallel to the  main  processing  track.  Residual  connections  work  in  a  similar  way  in feedforward deep networks, but they’re even simpler: they introduce a purely linear information carry track parallel to the main layer stack, thus helping to propagate gradients through arbitrarily deep stacks of layers.  . vanishing gradients  carry track  7.1.5 Layer weight sharing  One more important feature of the functional API is the ability to reuse a layer instance several times. When you call a layer instance twice, instead of instantiating a new layer for  each  call,  you  reuse  the  same  weights  with  every  call.  This  allows  you  to  build models that have shared branches—several branches that all share the same knowledge and perform the same operations. That is, they share the same representations and learn these representations simultaneously for different sets of inputs.  For example, consider a model that attempts to assess the semantic similarity between two sentences. The model has two inputs  the two sentences to compare  and outputs a score between 0 and 1, where 0 means unrelated sentences and 1 means sentences that are either identical or reformulations of each other. Such a model could be useful in many applications, including deduplicating natural-language queries in a dialog system.  In this setup, the two input sentences are interchangeable, because semantic similarity is a symmetrical relationship: the similarity of A to B is identical to the similarity of B to A.  For  this  reason,  it  wouldn’t  make  sense  to  learn  two  independent  models  for processing each input sentence. Rather, you want to process both with a single LSTM layer. The representations of this LSTM layer  its weights  are learned based on both inputs simultaneously. This is what we call a   Siamese LSTM  shared LSTM   model or a   .  Here is how to implement such a model using layer sharing  layer reuse  in the Keras  functional API:  library keras   lstm <- layer_lstm units = 32   left_input <- layer_input shape = list NULL, 128    left_output  % lstm    Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  238   right_input <- layer_input shape = list NULL, 128    right_output  % lstm    merged <- layer_concatenate list left_output, right_output    predictions  %   layer_dense units = 1, activation = "sigmoid"   model <- keras_model list left_input, right_input , predictions  model %>% fit    list left_data, right_data , targets     Instantiates a single LSTM layer, once Building the left branch of the model: inputs are variable-length sequences of vectors of size 128. Building the right branch of the model: when you call an existing layer instance, you reuse its weights. Builds the classifier on top Instantiating and training the model: when you train such a model, the weights of the LSTM layer are updated based on both inputs.  Naturally, a layer instance may be used more than once—it can be called arbitrarily  many times, reusing the same set of weights every time.  7.1.6 Models as layers  Importantly, in the functional API, models can be used as you’d use layers—effectively, you can think of a model as a "bigger layer." This is true of models created with both the   functions. This means you can call a keras_model   model on an input tensor and retrieve an output tensor:  keras_model_sequential     and   If the model has multiple input tensors and multiple output tensors, it should be called  y <- model x   with a list of tensors:  c y1, y2  %<-% <- model list x1, x2    When you call a model instance, you’re reusing the weights of the model—exactly like what happens when you call a layer instance. Calling an instance, whether it’s a layer instance or a model instance, will always reuse the existing learned representations of the instance—which is intuitive.  One simple practical example of what you can build by reusing a model instance is a vision model that uses a dual camera as its input: two parallel cameras, a few centimeters  one  inch   apart.  Such  a  model  can  perceive  depth,  which  can  be  useful  in  many applications. You shouldn’t need two independent models to extract visual features from the  left  camera  and  the  right  camera  before  merging  the  two  feeds.  Such  low-level  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  239   processing can be shared across the two inputs: that is, done via layers that use the same weights and thus share the same representations. Here is how you’d implement a siamese vision model  shared convolutional base  in Keras:  library keras   xception_base <- application_xception weights = NULL,                                        include_top = FALSE   left_input <- layer_input shape = c 250, 250, 3   right_input <- layer_input shape = c 250, 250, 3    left_features = left_input %>% xception_base   right_features  % xception_base    merged_features <- layer_concatenate    list left_features, right_features     The base image-processing model is the Xception network  convolutional base only . The inputs are 250 × 250 RGB images. Calls the same vision model twice The merged features contain information from the right visual feed and the left visual feed.  7.1.7 Wrapping up  This  concludes  our  introduction  to  the  Keras  functional  API—an  essential  tool  for building advanced deep neural network architectures.

Launching a training run on a large dataset for tens of epochs using   can be a bit like launching a paper airplane: past the initial impulse, you don’t have any control over its trajectory or its landing spot. If you want to avoid bad outcomes  and thus wasted paper airplanes , it’s smarter to use not  a  paper  plane,  but  a  drone  that  can  sense  its  environment,  send  data  back  to  its operator,  and  automatically  make  steering  decisions  based  on  its  current  state.  The techniques we present here will transform the call to   from a paper airplane into a smart, autonomous drone that can self-introspect and dynamically take action.  fit    7.2.1 Using callbacks to act on a model during training  When you’re training a model, there are many things you can’t predict from the start. In particular, you can’t tell how many epochs will be needed to get to an optimal validation loss. The examples so far have adopted the strategy of training for enough epochs that you begin overfitting, using the first run to figure out the proper number of epochs to train  for  and  then  finally  launch  a  new  training  run  from  scratch  using  this  optimal number. Of course, this approach is wasteful.   is an object that is passed to the model in the call to   A  much  better  way  to  handle  this  is  to  stop  training  when  you  measure  that  the validation loss in no longer improving. This can be achieved using a Keras callback. A  callback  and that is called by the model at various points during training. It has access to all the data available about the state of the model and its performance, and it can take action: interrupt training, save a model, load a different weight set, or otherwise alter the state of the model.  fit  Here are some examples of ways you can use callbacks:  Model checkpointing—Saving the current weights of the model at different points during training. Early stopping—Interrupting training when the validation loss is no longer improving  and of course, saving the best model obtained during training . Dynamically adjusting the value of certain parameters during training—Such as the learning rate of the optimizer. Logging training and validation metrics during training, or visualizing the representations learned by the model as they’re updated—The Keras progress bar that you’re familiar with is a callback!  Keras includes a number of built-in callbacks  this is not an exhaustive list :  callback_model_checkpoint   callback_early_stopping   callback_learning_rate_scheduler   callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau   callback_csv_logger    Let’s  review  a  few  of  them  to  give  you  an  idea  of  how  to  use  them:   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  241   callback_model_checkpoint  callback_early_stopping  ,   and   callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau  ,   .  callback_early_stopping  THE MODEL CHECKPOING AND EARLY STOPPING CALLBACKS You can use   to interrupt training once a target metric being monitored  has  stopped  improving  for  a  fixed  number  of  epochs.  For  instance,  this callback allows you to interrupt training as soon as you start overfitting, thus avoiding having to retrain your model for a smaller number of epochs. This callback is typically used  in  combination  with  ,  which  lets  you  continually save the model during training  and, optionally, save only the current best model so far: that  is,  the  version  of  the  model  that  achieved  the  best  performance  at  the  end  of  an epoch :  callback_model_checkpoint  library keras   callbacks_list <- list     callback_early_stopping       monitor = "acc",      patience = 1    ,    callback_model_checkpoint       filepath = "my_model.h5",      monitor = "val_loss",     save_best_only = TRUE        model %>% compile    optimizer = "rmsprop",   loss = "binary_crossentropy",    metrics = c "acc"     model %>% fit    x, y,   epochs = 10,   batch_size = 32,   callbacks = callbacks_list,   validation_data = list x_val, y_val     Callbacks are passed to the model via the callbacks argument in fit, which takes a list of callbacks. You can pass any number of callbacks. Interrupts training when improvement stops Monitors the model’s validation accuracy Interrupts training when accuracy has stopped improving for more than one epoch  that is, two epochs  Saves the current weights after every epoch Path to the destination model file These two arguments mean you won’t overwrite the model file unless val_loss has  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  242   improved, which allows you to keep the best model seen during training. You monitor acc, so it should be part of the model’s metrics. Note that because the callback will monitor validation accuracy, you need to pass validation_data to the call to fit.  THE REDUCE LEARNING RATE ON PLATEAU CALLBACK You can use this callback to reduce the learning rate when the validation loss has stopped improving. Reducing or increasing the learning rate in case of a   is is an effective strategy to get out of local minima during training. The following example uses  callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau  loss plateau  :  callbacks_list <- list    callback_reduce_lr_on_plateau       monitor = "val_loss",      factor = 0.1,      patience = 10        model %>% fit    x, y,   epochs = 10,   batch_size = 32,   callbacks = callbacks_list,   validation_data = list x_val, y_val     Monitors the model’s validation loss Divides learning by 10 when triggered The callback is triggered after the validation loss has stopped improving for at least 10 epochs. Because the callback will monitor the validation loss, you need to pass validation_data to the call to fit.  WRITING YOUR OWN CALLBACK If  you  need  to  take  a  specific  action  during  training  that  isn’t  covered  by  one  of  the built-in  callbacks,  you  can  write  your  own  callback.  Callbacks  are  implemented  by creating  a  new    class.  You  can  then implement any number of the following transparently named methods, which are called at various points during training:    class  that  inherits  from  the   KerasCallback  R6  on_epoch_begin  on_epoch_end  on_batch_begin  on_batch_end  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  243   on_train_begin  on_train_end  Called at the start of every epoch Called at the end of every epoch Called right before processing each batch Called right after processing each batch Called at the start of training Called at the end of training  These methods all are called with a    argument, which is a named list containing information  about  the  previous  batch,  epoch,  or  training  run:  training  and  validation metrics, and so on. Additionally, the callback has access to the following attributes:  logs  self$model—Reference to the Keras model being trained. self$params—Named list with training parameters  eg. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs…   Here’s a simple example saving a list of losses over each batch during training:  LossHistory <- R6Class "LossHistory",   inherit = KerasCallback,  library keras  library R6     public = list       losses = NULL,      on_batch_end = function batch, logs = list    {        self$losses <- c self$losses, logs[["loss"]]      }     history <- LossHistory$new   model %>% fit    x, y,   batch_size = 128,   epochs = 20,    callbacks = list history     > str history$losses  num [1:160] 0.634 0.615 0.631 0.664 0.626 ...

Now  you’re  equipped  to  perform  any  sort  of  logging  or preprogrammed intervention on a Keras model during training.  7.2.2 Introduction to TensorBoard: the TensorFlow visualization framework To do good research or develop good models, you need rich, frequent feedback about what’s going on inside your models during your experiments. That’s the point of running experiments: to get information about how well a model performs—as much information as possible. Making progress is an iterative process, or loop: you start with an idea and express it as an experiment, attempting to validate or invalidate your idea. Your run this experiment and process the information it generates. This inspires your next idea. The more iterations of this loop you’re able to run, the more refined and powerful your ideas become. Keras helps you go from idea to experiment in the least possible time, and fast GPUs can help you get from experiment to result as quickly as possible. But what about processing the experiment results? That’s where TensorBoard comes in.  Figure 7.9 The loop of progress  This section introduces TensorBoard, a browser-based visualization tool that comes packaged with TensorFlow. Note that it’s only available for Keras models when you’re using Keras with the TensorFlow backend.  The key purpose of TensorBoard is to help you visually monitor everything that goes on inside your model during training. If you’re monitoring more information than just the model’s final loss, you can develop a clearer vision of what the model does or doesn’t do, and you can make progress more quickly. TensorBoard gives you access to several neat features, all in your browser:  Visually monitoring metrics during training Visualizing your model architecture Visualizing histograms of activations and gradients Exploring embeddings in 3D  Let’s  demonstrate  these  features  on  a  simple  example.  You’ll  be  training  a  1D  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  245   convnet on the IMDB sentiment-analysis task.  The  model  is  similar  to  the  one  you  saw  in  the  last  section  of  chapter  6.  You’ll consider only the top 2,000 words in the IMDB vocabulary, to make visualizing word embedding more tractable.

This callback will  write log events to disk at the specified location.

Note that metrics won’t show up in TensorBoard until after the first epoch  if you don’t see your training metrics when you expect to you may need  to  refresh  the  display .  In  addition  to  live  graphs  of  the  training  and  validation metrics, you get access to the Histograms tab, where you can find pretty visualizations of histograms of activation values taken by your layers  see figure 7.11 .  Figure 7.10 TensorBoard: metrics monitoring  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  247   Figure 7.11 TensorBoard: activation histograms  The Embeddings tab gives you a way to inspect the embedding locations and spatial relationships  of  the  10,000  words  in  the  input  vocabulary,  as  learned  by  the  initial  .  Because  the  embedding  space  is  128-dimensional,  TensorBoard layer_embedding automatically reduces it to 2D or 3D using a dimensionality-reduction algorithm of your choice:  either  principal  component  analysis   PCA   or  t-distributed  stochastic  neighbor embedding  t-SNE . In figure 7.12, in the point cloud, you can clearly see two clusters: words  with  a  positive  connotation  and  words  with  a  negative  connotation.  The visualization  makes  it  immediately  obvious  that  embeddings  trained  jointly  with  a specific  objective  result  in  models  that  are  completely  specific  to  the  underlying task—that’s the reason using pretrained generic word embeddings is rarely a good idea.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  248   Figure 7.12 TensorBoard: interactive 3D word-embedding visualization  The  Graphs  tab  shows  an  interactive  visualization  of  the  graph  of  low-level TensorFlow operations underlying your Keras model  see figure 7.13 . As you can see, there is a lot more going on than you would expect. The model you just built may look simple when defined in Keras—a small stack of basic layers—but under the hood, you need to construct a fairly complex graph structure to make it work. A lot of it is related to the  gradient-descent  process.  This  complexity  differential  between  what  you  see  and what you’re manipulating is the key motivation for using Keras as your way of building models,  instead  of  working  with  raw  TensorFlow  to  define  everything  from  scratch. Keras makes your workflow dramatically simpler.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  249   Figure 7.13 TensorBoard: TensorFlow graph visualization  7.2.3 Wrapping up  Keras callbacks provide a simple way to monitor models during training and automatically take action based on the state of the model. When using TensorFlow, TensorBoard is a great way to visualize model activity in your browser. You can use it in Keras models via the   callback_tensorboard     function.  7.3 Getting the most out of your models  Trying out architectures blindly works well enough if you just need something that works okay.  In  this  section,  we’ll  go  beyond  "works  okay"  to  "works  great  and  wins machine-learning  competitions"  by  offering  you  a  quick  guide  to  a  set  of  must-know techniques for building state-of-the-art deep-learning models.  7.3.1 Advanced architecture patterns  We  covered  one  important  design  pattern  in  detail  in  the  previous  section:  residual connections. There are two more design patterns you should know about: normalization and separable convolution. These patterns are especially relevant when you’re building high-performing  deep  convnets,  but  they’re  commonly  found  in  many  other  types  of architectures as well.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  250   BATCH NORMALIZATION Normalization is a broad category of methods that seek to make different samples seen by a machine-learning model more similar to each other, which helps the model learn and generalize well to new data. The most common form of data normalization is one you’ve seen several times in this book already: centering the data on 0 by subtracting the mean from the data, and giving the data a unit standard deviation by dividing the data by its standard deviation. In effect, this makes the assumption that the data follows a normal  or Gaussian   distribution  and  makes  sure  this  distribution  is  centered  and  scaled  to  unit variance:  mean <- apply train_data, 2, mean  std <- apply train_data, 2, sd  train_data <- scale train_data, center = mean, scale = std  test_data <- scale test_data, center = mean, scale = std   Previous  examples  normalized  data  before  feeding  it  into  models.  But  data normalization should be a concern after every transformation operated by the network: even  if  the  data  entering  a    has  a  0  mean  and  unit variance, there is no reason to expect a priori that this will be the case for the data coming out.  layer_conv_2d  layer_dense    or   21  layer_batch_normalization  Batch  normalization  is  a  type  of  layer       in  Keras  introduced in 2015 by Ioffe and Szegedy;  it can adaptively normalize data even as the mean and variance change over time during training. It works by internally maintaining an exponential moving average of the batch-wise mean and variance of the data seen during  training.  The  main  effect  of  batch  normalization  is  that  it  helps  with  gradient propagation—much  like  residual  connections—and  thus  allows  for  deeper  networks. Some  very  deep  networks  can  only  be  trained  if  they  include  multiple  batch normalization  layers.  For  instance,    is  used  liberally  in many  of  the  advanced  convnet  architectures  that  come  packaged  with  Keras,  such  as ResNet50, Inception V3, and Xception.  layer_batch_normalization  Footnote 21mSergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy, "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift," Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning  arxiv.org abs 1502.03167    2015 ,   .  is typically used after a convolutional or densely  The   layer_batch_normalization  connected layer:  layer_conv_2d filters = 32, kernel_size = 3, activation = "relu"  %>% layer_batch_normalization    layer_dense units = 32, activation = "relu"  %>% layer_batch_normalization    The   layer_batch_normalization   argument, which specifies the feature axis that should be normalized.

That  is  precisely  what  the    layer  does     .  Such  a  layer  performs  a  spatial  convolution  on  each layer_separable_conv_2d channel  of  its  input,  independently,  before  mixing  output  channels  via  a  pointwise convolution   a  1  ×  1  convolution ,  as  shown  in  figure  7.14  This  is  equivalent  to separating  the  learning  of  spatial  features  and  the  learning  of  channel-wise  features, which makes a lot of sense if you assume that spatial locations in the input are highly correlated but different channels are fairly independent. It requires significantly fewer parameter and involves fewer computations, thus resulting in smaller, speedier models. And because it’s a more representationally efficient way to perform convolution, it tends to learn better representations using less data, resulting in better-performing models.

You can read more about the theoretical grounding for depthwise separable convolutions and  Xception  in  my  paper  "Xception:  Deep  Learning  with  Depthwise  Separable Convolutions."footnote[Chollet, Xception,   arxiv.org abs 1610.02357  .]  When  building  a  deep-learning  model,  you  have  to  make  many  seemingly  arbitrary decisions: how many layers should you stack? How many units or filters should go in each layer? Should you use   as activation, or a different function? Should you use   after a given layer? How much dropout should you use? layer_batch_normalization hyperparameters  to distinguish And so on. These architecture-level parameters are called  them from the parameters of a model, which are trained via backpropagation.  relu  In practice, experienced machine-learning engineers and researchers build intuition over  time  as  to  what  works  and  what  doesn’t  when  it  comes  to  these  choices—they develop hyperparameter-tuning skills. But there are no formal rules. If you want to get to the very limit of what can be achieved on a given task, you can’t be content with arbitrary choices made by a fallible human. Your initial decisions are almost always suboptimal, even if you have good intuition. You can refine your choices by tweaking them by hand and  retraining  the  model  repeatedly—that’s  what  machine-learning  engineers  and researchers spend most of their time doing. But it shouldn’t be your job as a human to fiddle with hyperparameters all day—that is better left to a machine.  Thus  you  need  to  explore  the  space  of  possible  decisions  automatically, systematically, in a principled way. You need to search the architecture space and find the best-performing ones empirically. That’s what the field of automatic hyperparameter optimization is about: it’s an entire field of research, and an important one.  The process of optimizing hyperparameters typically looks like this:  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.  Choose a set of hyperparameters  automatically . Build the corresponding model. Fit it to your training data, and measure the final performance on the validation data. Choose the next set of hyperparameters to try  automatically . Repeat. Eventually, measure performance on your test data.  The  key  to  this  process  is  the  algorithm  that  uses  this  history  of  validation performance,  given  various  sets  of  hyperparameters,  to  choose  the  next  set  of hyperparameters  to  evaluate.  Many  different  techniques  are  possible:  bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, simple random search, and so on.  Training the weights of a model is relatively easy: you compute a loss function on a mini-batch of data and then use the backpropagation algorithm to move the weights in the right direction. Updating hyperparameters, on the other hand, is extremely challenging. Consider the following:  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  254   Computing the feedback signal  does this set of hyperparameters lead to a high-performing model on this task?  can be extremely expensive: it requires creating and training a new model from scratch on your dataset. The hyperparameter space is typically made of discrete decisions and thus isn’t continuous or differentiable. Hence, you typically can’t do gradient descent in hyperparameter space. Instead, you must rely on gradient-free optimization techniques, which naturally are far less efficient than gradient descent.  Because these challenges are difficult and the field is still young, we currently only have  access  to  very  limited  tools  to  optimize  models.  Often,  it  turns  out  that  random search  choosing hyperparameters to evaluate at random, repeatedly  is the best solution, despite being the most naive one.  The   tfruns   package provides a set of tools that can assist with hyperparameter tuning,  including:  Tracking the hyperparameters, metrics, output, and source code of every training run. Comparing hyperparmaeters and metrics across runs to find the best performing model. Automatically generating reports to visualize individual training runs or comparisons between runs.  You   can   find   out  more   about   the   tfruns     package   at   tensorflow.rstudio.com tools tfruns   .  NOTE  One  important  issue  to  keep  in  mind  when  doing  hyperparameter optimization at scale is validation-set overfitting. Because you’re updating hyperparameters based on a signal that is computed using your validation data, you’re effectively training them on the validation data, and thus they will quickly overfit to the validation data. Always keep this in mind.  Overall,  hyperparameter  optimization  is  a  powerful  technique  that  is  an  absolute requirement  to  get  to  state-of-the-art  models  on  any  task  or  to  win  machine-learning competitions. Think about it: once upon a time, people handcrafted the features that went into  shallow  machine-learning  models.  That  was  very  much  suboptimal.  Now,  deep learning  automates  the  task  of  hierarchical  feature  engineering—features  are  learned using a feedback signal, not hand-tuned, and that’s the way it should be. In the same way, you  shouldn’t  handcraft  your  model  architectures;  you  should  optimize  them  in  a principled  way.  At  the  time  of  writing,  the  field  of  automatic  hyperparameter optimization is very young and immature, as deep learning was some years ago, but I expect it to boom in the next few years.  7.3.3 Model ensembling  One last powerful technique for obtaining the best possible results on a task is  model ensembling . Ensembling consists of pooling together the predictions of a set of different models, to produce better predictions. If you look at machine-learning competitions, in particular on Kaggle, the winners use very large ensembles of models that inevitably beat any single model, no matter how good.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  255   different reasons  Ensembling relies on the assumption that different good models trained independently : each model looks at slightly different aspects are likely to be good for  of the data to make its predictions, getting part of the "truth" but not all of it. You may be familiar with the parable of the blind men and the elephant: an ancient story of a group of blind men who come across an elephant for the first time and try to understand what the elephant is by touching it. Each man touches a different part of the elephant’s body—just one part, such as the trunk or a leg. Then the men describe to each other what an elephant is: "It’s like a snake", "Like a pillar or a tree," and so on. The blind men are essentially machine-learning  models  trying  to  understand  the  manifold  of  the  training  data,  each from its own perspective, using its own assumptions  provided by the unique architecture of the model and the unique random weight initialization . Each of them gets part of the truth of the data, but not the whole truth. By pooling their perspectives together, you can get a far more accurate description of the data. The elephant is a combination of parts: not any single blind man gets it quite right, but, interviewed together, they can tell a fairly accurate story.  Let’s use classification as an example. The easiest way to pool the predictions of a set   is to average their predictions at inference time:  ensemble the classifiers  of classifiers  to   preds_a  % predict x_val  preds_b  % predict x_val  preds_c  % predict x_val  preds_d  % predict x_val   final_preds <- 0.25 *  preds_a + preds_b + preds_c + preds_d   Use 4 different models to compute initial predictions. This new prediction array should be more accurate than any of the initial ones.  This will work only if the classifiers are more or less equally good. If one of them is significantly worse than the others, the final predictions may not be as good as the best classifier of the group.  A smarter way to ensemble classifiers is to do a weighted average, where the weights are  learned  on  the  validation  data—typically,  the  better  classifiers  are  given  a  higher weight, and the worse classifiers are given a lower weight. To search for a good set of ensembling weights, you can use random search or a simple optimization algorithm such as Nelder-Mead:  preds_a  % predict x_val  preds_b  % predict x_val  preds_c  % predict x_val  preds_d  % predict x_val   final_preds <- 0.5 * preds_a +                0.25 * preds_b +                0.1 * preds_c +                0.15 * preds_d  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  256   These weights  0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.15  are assumed to be learned empirically.  There are many possible variants: you can do an average of an exponential of the predictions, for instance. In general, a simple weighted average with weights optimized on the validation data provides a very strong baseline.  diversity  The key to making ensembling work is the    of the set of classifiers. Diversity is strength. If all the blind men only touched the elephant’s trunk, they would agree that elephants  are  like  snakes,  and  they  would  forever  stay  ignorant  of  the  truth  of  the elephant. Diversity is what makes ensembling work. In machine-learning terms, if all of your models are biased in the same way, then your ensemble will retain this same bias. If your models are  , the biases will cancel each other out, and the ensemble will be more robust and more accurate.  biased in different ways  as good as possible  For this reason, you should ensemble models that are    while being  as different as possible . This typically means using very different architectures or even different  brands  of  machine-learning  approaches.  One  thing  that  is  largely    worth doing is ensembling the same network trained several times independently, from different random  initializations.  If  the  only  difference  between  your  models  is  their  random initialization and the order in which they were exposed to the training data, then your ensemble will be low-diversity and will provide only a tiny improvement over any single model.  not  One thing I have found to work well in practice—but that doesn’t generalize to every problem  domain—is  the  use  of  an  ensemble  of  tree-based  methods   such  as  random forests  or  gradient-boosted  trees   and  deep  neural  networks.  In  2014,  partnering  with Andrei  Kolev,  I  took  fourth  place  in  the  Higgs  Boson  decay  detection  challenge  on Kaggle  www.kaggle.com c higgs-boson  using an ensemble of various tree models and deep neural networks. Remarkably, one of the models in the ensemble originated from a different  method  than  the  others   it  was  a  regularized  greedy  forest   and  had  a significantly worse score than the others. Unsurprisingly, it was assigned a small weight in the ensemble. But to our surprise, it turned out to improve the overall ensemble by a large factor, because it was so different from every other model: it provided information that the other models didn’t have access to. That’s precisely the point of ensembling. It’s not so much about how good your best model is; it’s about the diversity of your set of candidate models.  wide and deep  In recent times, one style of basic ensemble that has been very successful in practice is the   category of models, blending deep learning with shallow learning. Such models consist of jointly training a deep neural net with a large linear model. The joint  training  of  a  family  of  diverse  models  is  yet  another  option  to  achieve  model ensembling.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  257   7.3.4 Wrapping up  When building high-performing deep convnets, you’ll need to use residual connections, batch normalization, and depthwise separable convolutions. In the future, it’s likely that depthwise separable convolutions will completely replace regular convolutions, whether for 1D, 2D, or 3D applications, due to their higher representational efficiency. Building deep nets requires making many small hyperparameter and architecture choices, which together define how good your model will be. Rather than basing these choices on intuition or random chance, it’s better to systematically search hyperparameter space to find optimal choices. At this time, the process is expensive, and the tools to do it aren’t very good  but the   package may be able to help you manage the process more effectively . When doing hyperparameter optimization, be mindful of validation set overfitting! Winning machine-learning competitions or otherwise obtaining the best best possible results on a task can only be done with large ensembles of models. Ensembling via a well-optimized weighted average is usually good enough. Remember: diversity is strength. It’s largely pointless to ensemble very similar models; the best ensembles are sets of models that are as dissimilar as possible  while having as much predictive power as possible, naturally .  tfruns  7.4 Summary  In this chapter, you learned the following:  How to build models as arbitrary graphs of layers, reuse layers  layer weight sharing , and use models as R functions  model templating . You can use Keras callbacks to monitor your models during training and take action based on model state. TensorBoard allows you to visualize metrics, activation histograms, and even embeddin spaces. What batch normalization, depthwise separable convolution, and residual connections are. Why you should use hyperparameter optimization and model ensembling.  With these new tools, you’re better equipped to use deep learning in the real world and start building highly competitive deep-learning models.

It extends well into creative activities. When I first made the claim that in a not-so-distant future, most of the cultural content that you consume will be created with heavy help from  AIs,  I  was  met  with  utter  disbelief,  even  from  long-time  machine-learning practitioners.  That  was  in  2014.  Fast-forward  three  years,  and  the  disbelief  has receded—at  an  incredible  speed.  In  the  summer  of  2015,  we  were  entertained  by Google’s DeepDream algorithm turning an image into a psychedelic mess of dog eyes and  pareidolic  artifacts;  in  2016,  we  used  the  Prisma  application  to  turn  photos  into paintings  of  various  styles.  In  the  summer  of  2016,  an  experimental  short  movie,  Sunspring , was directed using a script written by a Long Short-Term Memory  LSTM  algorithm—complete with dialogue. Maybe you’ve recently listened to music that was tentatively generated by a neural network.  Granted, the artistic productions we have seen from AI so far have been fairly low quality.  AI  isn’t  anywhere  close  to  rivaling  human  screenwriters,  painters,  and composers.  But  replacing  humans  was  always  besides  the  point:  artificial  intelligence isn’t about replacing our own intelligence with something else, it’s about bringing into our lives and work   intelligence—intelligence of a different kind. In many fields, but especially in creative ones, AI will be used by humans as a tool to augment their own capabilities: more    intelligence than    intelligence.  augmented  artificial  more  A large part of artistic creation consists of simple pattern recognition and technical skill. And that is precisely the part of the process that many find less attractive or even  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  259   sample  latent  space  skippable. That’s where AI comes in. Our perceptual modalities, our language, and our artwork  all  have  statistical  structure.  Learning  this  structure  is  what  deep-learning algorithms  excel  at.  Machine-learning  models  can  learn  the  statistical    of images,  music,  or  stories,  and  they  can  then    from  this  space,  creating  new artworks  with  characteristics  similar  to  those  the  model  has  seen  in  its  training  data. Naturally,  such  sampling  is  hardly  an  act  of  artistic  creation  in  itself.  It’s  a  mere mathematical operation: the algorithm has no grounding in human life, human emotions, or our experience of the world; instead, it learns from an experience that has little in common  with  ours.  It’s  only  our  interpretation,  as  human  spectators,  that  will  give meaning to what the model generates. But in the hands of a skilled artist, algorithmic generation can be steered to become meaningful—and beautiful. Latent space sampling can  become  a  brush  that  empowers  the  artist,  augments  our  creative  affordances,  and expands the space of what we can imagine. What’s more, it can make artistic creation more accessible by eliminating the need for technical skill and practice—setting up a new medium of pure expression, factoring art apart from craft.  Iannis Xenakis, a visionary pioneer of electronic and algorithmic music, beautifully expressed this same idea in the 1960s, in the context of the application of automation technology to music composition:24 Footnote 24mIannis Xenakis, _Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition"  Indiana University Press, 1971 .  Freed from tedious calculations, the composer is able to devote himself to the genera problems that the new musical form poses and to explore the nooks and crannies of thi form  while  modifying  the  values  of  the  input  data.  For  example,  he  may  test  al instrumental combinations from soloists to chamber orchestras, to large orchestras. With the  aid  of  electronic  computers  the  composer  becomes  a  sort  of  pilot:  he  presses  the buttons, introduces coordinates, and supervises the controls of a cosmic vessel sailing in the  space  of  sound,  across  sonic  constellations  and  galaxies  that  he  could  formerly glimpse only as a distant dream.  In this chapter, we’ll explore from various angles the potential of deep learning to augment artistic creation. We’ll review sequence data generation  which can be used to generate  text  or  music ,  DeepDream,  and  image  generation  using  both  variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. We’ll get your computer to dream up content never seen before; and maybe we’ll get you to dream, too, about the fantastic possibilities that lie at the intersection of technology and art. Let’s get started.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  260   8.1 Text generation with LSTM  In  this  section,  we’ll  explore  how  recurrent  neural  networks  can  be  used  to  generate sequence data. We’ll use text generation as an example, but the exact same techniques can  be  generalized  to  any  kind  of  sequence  data:  you  could  apply  it  to  sequences  of musical  notes  in  order  to  generate  new  music,  to  timeseries  of  brushstroke  data   for example,  recorded  while  an  artist  paints  on  an  iPad   to  generate  paintings  stroke  by stroke, and so on.  Sequence data generation is in no way limited to artistic content generation. It has been successfully applied to speech synthesis and to dialogue generation for chatbots. The  Smart  Reply  feature  that  Google  released  in  2016,  capable  of  automatically generating a selection of quick replies to emails or text messages, is powered by similar techniques.  8.1.1 A brief history of generative recurrent networks  In  late  2014,  few  people  had  ever  heard  the  abbreviation  LSTM,  even  in  the machine-learning community. Successful applications of sequence data generation with recurrent networks only began to appear in the mainstream in 2016. But these techniques have a fairly long history, starting with the development of the LSTM algorithm in 1997. 25   This new algorithm was used early on to generate text character by character.  Footnote 25mSepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber, "Long Short-Term Memory," Neural Computation   9, no. 8  1997 .  In 2002, Douglas Eck, then at Schmidhuber’s lab in Switzerland, applied LSTM to music generation for the first time, with promising results. Eck is now a researcher at Google  Brain,  and  in  2016  he  started  a  new  research  group  there,  called  Magenta, focused  on  applying  modern  deep-learning  techniques  to  produce  engaging  music. Sometimes, good ideas take 15 years to get started.  In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Alex Graves did important pioneering work on using recurrent networks for sequence data generation. In particular, his 2013 work on applying recurrent mixture density networks to generate human-like handwriting using timeseries of pen positions is seen by some as a turning point.  This specific application of  neural  networks  at  that  specific  moment  in  time  captured  for  me  the  notion  of  machines  that  dream   and  was  a  significant  inspiration  around  the  time  I  started developing Keras. Graves left a similar commented-out remark hidden in a 2013 LateX file uploaded to the preprint server arXiv    : "generating sequential data is the closest  computers  get  to  dreaming."  Several  years  later,  we  take  a  lot  of  these developments  for  granted;  but  at  the  time,  it  was  difficult  to  watch  Graves’s demonstrations and not walk away awe-inspired by the possibilities.  arxiv.org  26  Footnote 26mAlex Graves, "Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks," arXiv  2013 ,  arxiv.org abs 1308.0850  .  Since  then,  recurrent  neural  networks  have  been  successfully  used  for  music generation,  dialogue  generation,  image  generation,  speech  synthesis,  and  molecule  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  261   design.  They  were  even  used  to  produce  a  movie  script  that  was  then  cast  with  live actors.  8.1.2 How do you generate sequence data?  The  universal  way  to  generate  sequence  data  in  deep  learning  is  to  train  a  network  usually an RNN or a convnet  to predict the next token or next few tokens in a sequence, using the previous tokens as input. For instance, given the input "the cat is on the ma," the network is trained to predict the target  , the next character. As usual when working with text data,   are typically words or characters, and any network that can model the probability of the next token given the previous ones is called a  . A language model captures the    of language: its statistical structure.  language model  latent space  tokens  t  sample conditioning  data   from it  generate new Once you have such a trained language model, you can  sequences :  you  feed  it  an  initial  string  of  text   called   ,  ask  it  to generate the next character or the next word  you can even generate several tokens at once , add the generated output back to the input data, and repeat the process many times  see  figure  8.1 .  This  loop  allows  you  to  generate  sequences  of  arbitrary  length  that reflect the structure of the data on which the model was trained: sequences that look  almost  like human-written sentences. In the example we present in this section, you’ll take a LSTM layer, feed it strings of   characters extracted from a text corpus, and train it to predict character   + 1. The output of the model will be a softmax over all possible characters:  a  probability  distribution  for  the  next  character.  This  LSTM  is  called  a  character-level neural language model  N  N  .  Figure 8.1 The process of character-by-character text generation using a language model  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  262   8.1.3 The importance of the sampling strategy  greedy sampling  When generating text, the way you choose the next character is crucially important. A naive approach is  , consisting of always choosing the most likely next character. But such an approach results in repetitive, predictable strings that don’t look like  coherent  language.  A  more  interesting  approach  makes  slightly  more  surprising choices:  it  introduces  randomness  in  the  sampling  process,  by  sampling  from  the stochastic sampling   recall probability distribution for the next character. This is called  e  in this field . In such a setup, if  that   has a probability 0.3 of being the next character, according to the model, you’ll choose it 30% of the time. Note that greedy sampling can be also cast as sampling from a probability distribution:  one  where  a  certain  character  has  probability  1  and  all  others  have probability 0.   is what we call   stochasticity  randomness  Sampling probabilistically from the softmax output of the model is neat: it allows even  unlikely  characters  to  be  sampled  some  of  the  time,  generating  more interesting-looking sentences and sometimes showing creativity by coming up with new, realistic-sounding words that didn’t occur in the training data. But there is one issue with this strategy: it doesn’t offer a way to   in the sampling process.  control the amount of randomness  Why  would  you  want  more  or  less  randomness?  Consider  an  extreme  case:  pure random  sampling,  where  you  draw  the  next  character  from  a  uniform  probability distribution  and  every  character  is  equally  likely.  This  scheme  has  maximum randomness;  in  other  words,  this  probability  distribution  has  maximum  entropy. Naturally, it won’t produce anything interesting. At the other extreme, greedy sampling doesn’t produce anything interesting, either, and has no randomness: the corresponding probability  distribution  has  minimum  entropy.  Sampling  from  the  "real"  probability distribution—the distribution that is output by the model’s softmax function—constitutes an intermediate point between these two extremes. But there are many other intermediate points of higher or lower entropy that you may want to explore. Less entropy will give the generated sequences a more predictable structure  and thus they will potentially be more realistic looking , whereas more entropy will result in more surprising and creative sequences. When sampling from generative models, it’s always good to explore different amounts  of  randomness  in  the  generation  process.  Because  we—humans—are  the ultimate  judges  of  how  interesting  the  generated  data  is,  interestingness  is  highly subjective, and there is no telling in advance where the point of optimal entropy lies.  In  order  to  control  the  amount  of  stochasticity  in  the  sampling  process,  we’ll introduce a parameter called the   that characterizes the entropy of the probability distribution used for sampling: in other words, it characterizes how surprising or predictable the choice of the next character will be. Given a   value, a new probability distribution is computed from the original one  the softmax output of the model  by reweighting it in the following way.  softmax temperature  temperature  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  263   Listing 8.1 Reweighting a probability distribution to a different temperature  reweight_distribution <- function original_distribution, temperature = 0.5  {    distribution <- log original_distribution    temperature   distribution <- exp distribution     distribution   sum distribution  }  original_distribution is a vector of probability values that must sum to 1. temperature is a factor quantifying the entropy of the output distribution. Returns a reweighted version of the original distribution. The sum of the distribution may no longer be 1, so you divide it by its sum to obtain the new distribution.  Higher  temperatures  result  in  sampling  distributions  of  higher  entropy  that  will generate more surprising and unstructured generated data, whereas a lower temperature will result in less randomness and much more predictable generated data  see figure 8.2 .  Figure 8.2 Different reweightings of a same probability distribution. Low temperature = more deterministic, high temperature = more random.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  264   8.1.4 Implementing character-level LSTM text generation  Let’s put these ideas into practice in a Keras implementation. The first thing you need is a lot of text data that you can use to learn a language model. You can use any sufficiently large text file or set of text files—Wikipedia,  , and so on. In this example,  you’ll  use  some  of  the  writings  of  Nietzsche,  the  late-19th  century  German philosopher   translated  to  English .  The  language  model  you’ll  learn  will  thus  be specifically a model of Nietzsche’s writing style and topics of choice, rather than a more generic model of the English language.  The Lord of the Rings  PREPARING THE DATA Let’s start by downloading the corpus and converting it to lowercase.  Listing 8.2 Downloading and parsing the initial text file  library keras  library stringr   path <- get_file    "nietzsche.txt",   origin = "https:  s3.amazonaws.com text-datasets nietzsche.txt"   text <- tolower readChar path, file.info path $size   cat "Corpus length:", nchar text , "\n"   Next, you’ll extract partially overlapping sequences of length   , one-hot encode them,  and  pack  them  in  a  3D  array   sequences,  maxlen,   containing  the unique_characters  corresponding  targets:  the  one-hot-encoded  characters  that  come  after  each  extracted sequence.  .  Simultaneously,  you’ll  prepare  an  array     of  shape   maxlen  y  x  Listing 8.3 Vectorizing sequences of characters  maxlen <- 60  step <- 3  text_indexes <- seq 1, nchar text  - maxlen, by = step   sentences <- str_sub text, text_indexes, text_indexes + maxlen - 1   next_chars <- str_sub text, text_indexes + maxlen, text_indexes + maxlen   cat "Number of sequences: ", length sentences , "\n"   chars <- unique sort strsplit text, "" [[1]]   cat "Unique characters:", length chars , "\n"   char_indices <- 1:length chars  names char_indices  <- chars  cat "Vectorization...\n"  x <- array 0L, dim = c length sentences , maxlen, length chars    y <- array 0L, dim = c length sentences , length chars    for  i in 1:length sentences   {   sentence <- strsplit sentences[[i]], "" [[1]]   for  t in 1:length sentence   {  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  265       char <- sentence[[t]]     x[i, t, char_indices[[char]]] <- 1   }   next_char <- next_chars[[i]]   y[i, char_indices[[next_char]]] <- 1 }  We’ll extract sequences of 60 characters We’ll sample a new sequence every 3 characters This holds the extracted sequences This holds the targets  the follow-up characters  List of unique characters in the corpus Named list that maps unique characters to their index in the list "chars" One-hot encodes the characters into binary arrays  BUILDING THE NETWORK This network is a single LSTM layer followed by a dense classifier and softmax over all possible characters. But note that recurrent neural networks aren’t the only way to do sequence data generation; 1D convnets also have proven extremely successful at this task in recent times.  Listing 8.4 Single-layer LSTM model for next-character prediction  model  %   layer_lstm units = 128, input_shape = c maxlen, length chars    %>%   layer_dense units = length chars , activation = "softmax"   Because your targets are one-hot encoded, you’ll use  categorical_crossentropy  as the loss to train the model.  Listing 8.5 Model compilation configuration  optimizer <- optimizer_rmsprop lr = 0.01   model %>% compile    loss = "categorical_crossentropy",   optimizer = optimizer    TRAINING THE LANGUAGE MODEL AND SAMPLING FROM IT Given a trained model and a seed text snippet, you can generate new text by doing the following repeatedly:  1.  2. 3. 4.  Draw from the model a probability distribution over the next character, given the text available so far. Reweight the distribution to a certain temperature. Sample the next character at random according to the reweighted distribution. Add the new character at the end of the available text.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  266   This is the code you use to reweight the original probability distribution coming out  of the model and draw a character index from it  the   sampling function   .  Listing 8.6 Function to sample the next character given the model’s predictions  sample_next_char <- function preds, temperature = 1.0  {   preds <- as.numeric preds    preds <- log preds    temperature   exp_preds <- exp preds    preds <- exp_preds   sum exp_preds    which.max t rmultinom 1, 1, preds    }  Finally, the following loop repeatedly trains and generates text. You begin generating text using a range of different temperatures after every epoch. This allows you to see how the  generated  text  evolves  as  the  model  begins  to  converge,  as  well  as  the  impact  of temperature in the sampling strategy.

A clever balance between learned structure and randomness is what makes generation interesting.  eterned   and   Note that by training a bigger model, longer, on more data, you can achieve generated samples that look much more coherent and realistic than this one. But, of course, don’t expect to ever generate any meaningful text, other than by random chance: all you’re doing is sampling data from a statistical model of which characters come after which characters.  Language  is  a  communication  channel,  and  there  is  a  distinction  between what communications are about and the statistical structure of the messages in which communications are encoded. To evidence this distinction, here is a thought experiment: what  if  human  language  did  a  better  job  of  compressing  communications,  much  like computers do with most digital communications? Language would be no less meaningful, but it would lack any intrinsic statistical structure, thus making it impossible to learn a language model as you just did.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  269   WRAPPING UP  You can generate discrete sequence data by training a model to predict the next tokens s  given previous tokens. In the case of text, such a model is called a  words or characters. Sampling the next token requires balance between adhering to what the model judges likely, and introducing randomness. One way to handle this is the notion of softmax temperature. Always experiment with different temperatures to find the right one.  . It can be based on either  language model  8.2 DeepDream  DeepDream  is  an  artistic  image-modification  technique  that  uses  the  representations learned by convolutional neural networks. It was first released by Google in the summer of 2015, as an implementation written using the Caffe deep-learning library  this was several months before the first public release of TensorFlow .  It quickly became an internet sensation thanks to the trippy pictures it could generate  see, for example, figure 8.3 , full of algorithmic pareidolia artifacts, bird feathers, and dog eyes—a byproduct of the fact that the DeepDream convnet was trained on ImageNet, where dog breeds and bird species are vastly over-represented.  27  Footnote 27mAlexander Mordvintsev, Christopher Olah, and Mike Tyka, "DeepDream: A Code Example for Visualizing Neural Networks,"   Google Research Blog  , July 1, 2015,   mng.bz xXlM  .  Figure 8.3 Example of a DeepDream output image  The  DeepDream  algorithm  is  almost  identical  to  the  convnet  filter-visualization technique  introduced  in  chapter  5,  consisting  of  running  a  convnet  in  reverse:  doing  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  270   gradient  ascent  on  the  input  to  the  convnet  in  order  to  maximize  the  activation  of  a specific filter in an upper layer of the convnet. DeepDream uses this same idea, with a few simple differences:  With DeepDream, you try to maximize the activation of entire layers rather than that of a specific filter, thus mixing together visualizations of large numbers of features at once. You start not from blank, slightly noisy input, but rather from an existing image—thus the resulting effects latch unto pre-existing visual patterns, distorting elements of the image in a somewhat artistic fashion. The input images are processed at different scales  called  quality of the visualizations.   , which improves the  octaves  Let’s make some DeepDreams.  8.2.1 Implementing DeepDream in Keras  You’ll start from a convnet pretrained on ImageNet. In Keras, many such convnets are available:  VGG16,  VGG19,  Xception,  ResNet50,  and  so  on.  You  can  implement DeepDream  with  any  of  them,  but  your  convnet  of  choice  will  naturally  affect  your visualizations, because different convnet architectures result in different learned features. The  convnet  used  in  the  original  DeepDream  release  was  an  Inception  model,  and  in practice  Inception  is  known  to  produce  nice-looking  DeepDreams,  so  you’ll  use  the Inception V3 model that comes with Keras.

You’ll start from a somewhat arbitrary configuration involving four layers—but you’ll definitely want to explore many different configurations later.

Note that the layer names are hardcoded in the built-in Inception V3 application. You can list all layer names using summary model .  Now let’s define a tensor that contains the loss: the weighted sum of the L2 norm of  the activations of the layers in listing 8.9.

Given a small image size S L and a larger image size  , you can compute the difference between the original image L  assumed  larger  than    and  the  original  resized  to  size  —this    resized  to  size  difference quantifies the details lost when going from    to   L  L  S  S  .

For instance, blue-and-yellow circular brushstrokes are considered to be the style in  figure  8.7   using    by  Vincent  Van  Gogh ,  and  the  buildings  in  the Tübingen photograph are considered to be the content.  Starry  Night  content  The idea of style transfer, which is tightly related to that of texture generation, has had a long history in the image-processing community prior to the development of neural style transfer in 2015. But as it turns out, the deep learning-based implementations of style  transfer  offer  results  unparalleled  by  what  had  been  previously  achieved  with classical  computer-vision  techniques,  and  they  triggered  an  amazing  renaissance  in creative applications of computer vision.  The key notion behind implementing style transfer is the same idea that is central to all  deep-learning  algorithms:  you  define  a  loss  function  to  specify  what  you  want  to achieve, and you minimize this loss. You know what you want to achieve: conserving the content of the original image while adopting the style of the reference image. If we were able  to  mathematically  define  ,  then  an  appropriate  loss  function  to minimize would be the following:  content    and   style  loss <- distance style reference_image  - style generated_image   +         distance content original_image  - content generated_image    Here,   distance   is a norm function such as the L2 norm,    is a function that takes an image and computes a representation of its content, and   is a function that takes an image and computes a representation of its style. Minimizing this loss causes  ,  and  style generated_image  , thus achieving  to  be  close   is close to   content generated_image   style reference_image   content  style  to     content generated_image  style transfer as we defined it.  A fundamental observation made by Gatys et al. was that deep convolutional neural  functions.  networks offer a precise way to mathematically define the  Let’s see how.  content   and   style  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  278   8.3.1 The content loss  8.3.2 The style loss  ,   As  you  already  know,  activations  from  earlier  layers  in  a  network  contain  local information about the image, whereas activations from higher layers contain increasingly  global abstract   information.  Formulated  in  a  different  way,  the  activations  of  the different layers of a convnet provide a decomposition of the contents of an image over different spatial scales. Therefore, you’d expect the content of an image, which is more global and abstract, to be captured by the representations of an upper layer in a convnet.  A good candidate for content loss is thus the L2 norm between the activations of an upper layer in a pretrained convnet, computed over the target image, and the activations of the same layer computed over the generated image. This guarantees that, as seen from the  upper  layer,  the  generated  image  will  look  similar  to  the  original  target  image. Assuming that what the upper layers of a convnet see is really the content of their input images, then this works as a way to preserve image content.  The content loss only uses a single upper layer, but the style loss as defined by Gatys et al.  uses  multiple  layers  of  a  convnet:  you  try  to  capture  the  appearance  of  the style-reference image at all spatial scales extracted by the convnet, not just a single scale. For the style loss, Gatys et al. use the   of a layer’s activations: the inner product of the feature maps of a given layer. This inner product can be understood as representing  a  map  of  the  correlations  between  the  a  layer’s  features.  These  feature correlations  capture  the  statistics  of  the  patterns  of  a  particular  spatial  scale,  which empirically correspond to the appearance of the textures found at this scale.  Gram matrix  Hence  the  style  loss  aims  to  preserve  similar  internal  correlations  within  the activations of different layers, across the style- reference image and the generated image. In  turn,  this  guarantees  that  the  textures  found  at  different  spatial  scales  look  similar across the style-reference image and the generated image.  In short, you can use a pretrained convnet to define a loss that will do the following:  Preserve content by maintaining similar high-level layer activations between the target content image and the generated image. The convnet should "see" both the target image and the generated image as containing the same things. Preserve style by maintaining similar   within activations for both low-level layers and high-level layers. Feature correlations capture  : the generated image and the style-reference image should share the same textures at different spatial scales.  correlations  textures  Now, let’s look at a Keras implementation of the original 2015 neural style-transfer algorithm. As you’ll see, it shares many similarities with the DeepDream implementation developed in the previous section.  8.3.3 Neural style transfer in Keras  Neural style transfer can be implemented using any pretrained convnet. Here you’ll use the  VGG19  network  used  by  Gatys  et  al.  VGG19  is  a  simple  variant  of  the  VGG16 network introduced in chapter 5, with three more convolutional layers.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  279   This is the general process:  1.  2.  3.  Set up a network that computes VGG19 layer activations for the style-reference image, the target image, and the generated image at the same time. Use the layer activations computed over these three images to define the loss function described earlier, which you’ll minimize in order to achieve style transfer. Set up a gradient-descent process to minimize this loss function.  Let’s start by defining the paths to the style-reference image and the target image. To make sure that the processed images are a similar size  widely different sizes make style transfer more difficult , you’ll later resize them all to a shared height of 400 px.  Listing 8.14 Defining initial variables  library keras  K <- backend    target_image_path <- "img portrait.png"  style_reference_image_path <- "img transfer_style_reference.png"  img <- image_load target_image_path  width <- img$size[[1]] height <- img$size[[2]] img_nrows <- 400 img_ncols <- as.integer width * img_nrows   height   Path to the image you want to transform Path to the style image Calculate dimensions of the generated picture  You need some auxiliary functions for loading, preprocessing, and post-processing  the images that go in and out of the VGG19 convnet.  Listing 8.15 Auxiliary functions  preprocess_image <- function path  {   img  %     image_to_array   %>%     array_reshape c 1, dim .      imagenet_preprocess_input img  }  deprocess_image <- function x  {   x <- x[1,,,]    x[,,1] <- x[,,1] + 103.939   x[,,2] <- x[,,2] + 116.779   x[,,3] <- x[,,3] + 123.68    x <- x[,,c 3,2,1 ]   x[x > 255] <- 255   x[x < 0] <- 0   x[] <- as.integer x  255   x }  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  280   Zero-centering by removing the mean pixel value from ImageNet. This reverses a transformation done by `imagenet_preprocess_input. Convert images from 'BGR' to 'RGB'. This is also part of the reversal of `imagenet_preprocess_input.  Let’s  set  up  the  VGG19  network.  It  takes  as  input  a  batch  of  three  images:  the style-reference image, the target image, and a placeholder that will contain the generated image. A placeholder is a symbolic tensor, the values of which are provided externally via  R  arrays.  The  style-reference  and  target  image  are  static  and  thus  defined  using  , whereas the values contained in the placeholder of the generated image will K$constant change over time.

The model will be loaded with pretrained ImageNet weights.  Let’s  define  the  content  loss,  which  will  make  sure  the  top  layer  of  the  VGG19  convnet has a similar view of the target image and the generated image.  Listing 8.17 Content loss  content_loss <- function base, combination  {   K$sum K$square combination - base   }  Next is the style loss. It uses an auxiliary function to compute the Gram matrix of an  input matrix: a map of the correlations found in the original feature matrix.  Listing 8.18 Style loss  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  281   gram_matrix <- function x  {   features <- K$batch_flatten K$permute_dimensions x, list 2L, 0L, 1L      gram <- K$dot features, K$transpose features     gram }  style_loss <- function style, combination {   S <- gram_matrix style    C <- gram_matrix combination    channels <- 3   size <- img_nrows*img_ncols   K$sum K$square S - C      4 * channels^2  * size^2  }  To  these  two  loss  components,  you  add  a  third:  the   ,  which operates  on  the  pixels  of  the  generated  combination  image.  It  encourages  spatial continuity  in  the  generated  image,  thus  avoiding  overly  pixelated  results.  You  can interpret it as a regularization loss.  total  variation  loss  Listing 8.19 Total variation loss  total_variation_loss <- function x  {   y_ij  <- x[,1: img_nrows - 1L , 1: img_ncols - 1L ,]   y_i1j <- x[,2: img_nrows , 1: img_ncols - 1L ,]   y_ij1 <- x[,1: img_nrows - 1L , 2: img_ncols ,]   a <- K$square y_ij - y_i1j    b <- K$square y_ij - y_ij1    K$sum K$pow a + b, 1.25   }  The loss that you minimize is a weighted average of these three losses.

In the original Gatys et al. paper, optimization is performed using the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno  L-BFGS  algorithm, so that is also what you’ll use here. This is a key difference from the  DeepDream  example  in  section  8.2.  The  L-BFGS  algorithm  is  available  via  the   implementation: optim     function, but there are two slight limitations with the   optim    It requires that you pass the value of the loss function and the value of the gradients as two separate functions. It can only be applied to flat vectors, whereas you have a 3D image array.  It would be inefficient to compute the value of the loss function and the value of the gradients independently, because doing so would lead to a lot of redundant computation between the two; the process would be almost twice as slow as computing them jointly. To bypass this, you’ll set up an R6 class named   that computes both the loss value and the gradients value at once, returns the loss value when called the first time, and caches the gradients for the next call.

We flatten the image because optim can only process flat vectors. Runs L-BFGS over the pixels of the generated image to minimize the neural style loss. Note that we have to pass the function that computes the loss and the function that computes the gradients as two separate arguments.  Figure 8.8 shows what you get. Keep in mind that what this technique achieves is merely a form of image retexturing, or texture transfer. It works best with style- reference images that are strongly textured and highly self-similar, and with content targets that don’t require high levels of detail in order to be recognizable. It typically can’t achieve fairly abstract feats such as transferring the style of one portrait to another. The algorithm is closer to classical signal processing than to AI, so don’t expect it to work like magic!

Once that is done, stylizing a given image is instantaneous: it’s just a forward pass of this small convnet.  8.3.4 Wrapping up  Style transfer consists of creating a new image that preserves the contents of a target image while also capturing the style of a reference image. Content can be captured by the high-level activations of a convnet. Style can be captured by the internal correlations of the activations of different layers of a convnet. Hence deep learning allows style transfer to be formulated as an optimization process using a loss defined with a pretrained convnet. Starting from this basic idea, many variants and refinements are possible.  8.4 Generating images with variational autoencoders  Sampling from a latent space of images to create entirely new images or edit existing ones  is  currently  the  most  popular  and  successful  application  of  creative  AI.  In  this section  and  the  next,  we’ll  review  some  high-level  concepts  pertaining  to  image generation, alongside implementations details relative to the two main techniques in this domain:    GANs . The  techniques  we  present  here  aren’t  specific  to  images—you  could  develop  latent spaces of sound, music, or even text, using GANs and VAEs—but in practice, the most interesting results have been obtained with pictures, and that is what we focus on here.  generative adversarial networks  variational autoencoders    VAEs  and   8.4.1 Sampling from latent spaces of images  The  key  idea  of  image  generation  is  to  develop  a  low-dimensional    of representations  which naturally is a vector space  where any point can be mapped to a realistic-looking image. The module capable of realizing this mapping, taking as input a latent point and outputting an image  a grid of pixels  is called a    in the case of GANs  or a    in the case of VAEs . Once such a latent space has been developed, you can sample points from it, either deliberately or at random, and, by mapping them to image space, generate images that have never been seen before  see figure 8.9 .  latent  space  generator  decoder  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  287   Figure 8.9 Learning a latent vector space of images, and using it to sample new images  GANs and VAEs are two different strategies for learning such latent spaces of image representations,  each  with  its  own  characteristics.  VAEs  are  great  for  learning  latent spaces that are well structured, where specific directions encode a meaningful axis of variation in the data. GANs generate images that can potentially be highly realistic, but the latent space they come from may not have as much structure and continuity.

The  idea  is  still  the  same:  given  a  latent  space  of  representations,  or  an embedding space, certain directions in the space may encode interesting axes of variation in the original data. In a latent space of images of faces, for instance, there may be a  smile vector s  is the embedded representation of a certain face,   then latent point   is the embedded representation of the same face, smiling. Once you’ve identified such a vector, it then becomes possible to edit images by projecting them into the latent space, moving their representation in a meaningful way, and then decoding  them  back  to  image  space.  There  are  concept  vectors  for  essentially  any independent  dimension  of  variation  in  image  space—in  the  case  of  faces,  you  may discover vectors for adding sunglasses to a face, removing glasses, turning a male face into as female face, and so on. Figure 8.11 is an example of a smile vector, a concept vector discovered by Tom White from the Victoria University School of Design in New Zealand, using VAEs trained on a dataset of faces of celebrities  the CelebA dataset .  Figure 8.11 The smile vector  8.4.3 Variational autoencoders  29  Variational  autoencoders,  simultaneously  discovered  by  Kingma  and  Welling  in December 2013  and Rezende, Mohamed, and Wierstra in January 2014,  are a kind of generative model that is especially appropriate for the task of image editing via concept vectors. They’re a modern take on autoencoders—a type of network that aims to encode an input to a low-dimensional latent space and then decode it back—that mixes ideas from deep learning with Bayesian inference.  30  Footnote 29mDiederik P.

It’s then trained by using as target data the   as the input images, meaning the autoencoder learns to reconstruct the  original  inputs.  By  imposing  various  constraints  on  the  code   the  output  of  the encoder ,  you  can  get  the  autoencoder  to  learn  more-or-less  interesting  latent representations  of  the  data.  Most  commonly,  you’ll  constrain  the  code  to  be low-dimensional and sparse  mostly zeros , in which case the encoder acts as a way to compress the input data into fewer bits of information.  Figure 8.12 An autoencoder: mapping an input x to a compressed representation and then decoding it back as x'  In  practice,  such  classical  autoencoders  don’t  lead  to  particularly  useful  or well-structured latent spaces. They’re not much good at compression, either. For these reasons, they have largely fallen out of fashion. VAEs, however, augment autoencoders with a little statistical magic that forces them to learn continuous, highly structured latent spaces. They have turned out to be a powerful tool for image generation.  A VAE, instead of compressing its input image into a fixed code in the latent space, turns the image into the parameters of a statistical distribution: a mean and a variance. Essentially,  this  means  you’re  assuming  the  input  image  has  been  generated  by  a statistical process, and that the randomness of this process should be taken into account during encoding and decoding. The VAE then uses the mean and variance parameters to randomly sample one element of the distribution, and decodes that element back to the original input  see figure 8.13 . The stochasticity of this process improves robustness and forces  the  latent  space  to  encode  meaningful  representations  everywhere:  every  point sampled in the latent space is decoded to a valid output.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  290   Figure 8.13 A VAE maps an image to two vectors, z_mean and z_log_sigma, which define a probability distribution over the latent space, used to sample a latent point to decode.

Any similar to  two  close  points  in  the  latent  space  will  decode  to  highly  similar  images.  Continuity, combined with the low dimensionality of the latent space, forces every direction in the latent space to encode a meaningful axis of variation of the data, making the latent space very structured and thus highly suitable to manipulation via concept vectors.      The parameters of a VAE are trained via two loss functions: a  forces  the  decoded  samples  to  match  the  initial  inputs,  and  a  helps learn well-formed latent spaces and reduce overfitting to the training data.  reconstruction loss regularization  loss   that   that  Let’s quickly go over a Keras implementation of a VAE.

Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  295   Figure 8.14 Grid of digits decoded from the latent space  In the next section, we’ll cover in detail the other major tool for generating artificial  images: generative adversarial networks  GANs .  8.4.4 Wrapping up  Image generation with deep learning is done by learning latent spaces that capture statistical information about a dataset of images. By sampling and decoding points from the latent space, you can generate never-before-seen images. There are two major tools to do this: VAEs and GANs. VAEs result in highly structured, continuous latent representations. For this reason, they work well for doing all sorts of image editing in latent space: face swapping, turning a frowning face into a smiling face, and so on. They also work nicely for doing latent-space- based animations, such as animating a walk along a cross section of the latent space, showing a starting image slowly morphing into different images in a continuous way. GANs enable the generation of realistic single-frame images but may not induce latent spaces with solid structure and high continuity.  Most successful practical applications I have seen with images rely on VAEs, but GANs are  extremely  popular  in  the  world  of  academic  research—at  least,  circa  2016-2017. You’ll find out how they work and how to implement one in the next section.  TIP  To play further with image generation, I suggest working with the Large-scale Celeb  Faces  Attributes   CelebA   dataset.  It’s  a  free-to-download  image dataset  containing  more  than  200,000  celebrity  portraits.  It’s  great  for experimenting with concept vectors in particular—it definitely beats MNIST.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  296   8.5 Introduction to generative adversarial networks  Generative adversarial networks  GANs , introduced in 2014 by Goodfellow et al.,  are an alternative to VAEs for learning latent spaces of images. They enable the generation of  fairly  realistic  synthetic  images  by  forcing  the  generated  images  to  be  statistically almost indistinguishable from real ones.  31  Footnote 31mIan Goodfellow et al., "Generative Adversarial Networks," arXiv, 2014,  arxiv.org abs 1406.2661  .  An intuitive way to understand GANs is to imagine a forger trying to create a fake Picasso painting. At first, the forger is pretty bad at the task. He mixes some of his fakes with authentic Picassos and shows them all to an art dealer. The art dealer makes an authenticity  assessment  for  each  painting  and  gives  the  forger  feedback  about  what makes a Picasso look like a Picasso. The forger goes back to his studio to prepare some new fakes. As times goes on, the forger becomes increasingly competent at imitating the style of Picasso, and the art dealer becomes increasingly expert at spotting fakes. In the end, they have on their hands some excellent fake Picassos.  That’s what a GAN is: a forger network network and an expert network, each being  trained to best the other. As such, a GAN is made of two parts:  Generator network—Takes as input a random vector  a random point in the latent space , and decodes it into a synthetic image Discriminator network  or adversary —Takes as input an image  real or synthetic , and must predict whether the image came from the training set or was created by the generator network.  The generator network is trained to be able to fool the discriminator network, and thus  it  evolves  toward  generating  increasingly  realistic  images  as  training  goes  on: artificial  images  that  look  indistinguishable  from  real  ones,  to  the  extent  that  it’s impossible  for  the  discriminator  network  to  tell  the  two  apart   see  figure  8.15 . Meanwhile,  the  discriminator  is  constantly  adapting  to  the  gradually  improving capabilities of the generator, which sets a high bar of realism for the generated images. Once training is over, the generator is capable of turning any point in its input space into a  believable  image.  Unlike  VAEs,  this  latent  space  has  less  explicit  guarantees  of meaningful structure; in particular, it isn’t continuous.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  297   Figure 8.15 A generator transforms random latent vectors into images, and a discriminator seeks to tell real images from generated ones. The generator is trained to fool the discriminator.  Remarkably, a GAN is a system where the optimization minimum isn’t fixed, unlike in any other training setup you’ve encountered in this book. Normally, gradient descent consists of rolling down hills in a static loss landscape. But with a GAN, every step taken down  the  hill  changes  the  entire  landscape  a  little.  It’s  a  dynamic  system  where  the optimization process is seeking not a minimum, but an equilibrium between two forces. For this reason, GANs are notoriously difficult to train—getting a GAN to work requires lots of careful tuning of the model architecture and training parameters.  Figure 8.16 Latent space dwellers. Images generated by Mike Tyka using a multistaged GAN trained on a dataset of faces  www.miketyka.com .  8.5.1 A schematic GAN implementation  In  this  section,  we’ll  explain  how  to  implement  a  GAN  in  Keras,  in  its  barest form—because GANs are advanced, diving deeply into the technical details would be out of  scope  for  this  book.

You train the discriminator using examples of real and fake images along with "real" "fake" labels, just as you train any regular image- classification model. To train the generator, you use the gradients of the generator’s weights with regard to the loss of the   model. This means, at every step, you move the weights of the generator in a direction that makes the discriminator more likely to classify as "real" the images decoded by the generator. In other words, you train the generator to fool the discriminator.  . Thus this   gan x   gan  gan  8.5.2 A bag of tricks  Training GANs and tuning GAN implementations is notoriously difficult. There are a number of known tricks you should keep in mind. Like most things in deep learning, it’s more  alchemy  than  science:  these  tricks  are  heuristics,  not  theory-backed  guidelines. They’re supported by a level of intuitive understanding of the phenomenon at hand, and they’re known to work well empirically, although not necessarily in every context.  Here  are  a  few  of  the  tricks  used  in  the  implementation  of  a  GAN  generator  and discriminator in this section. It isn’t an exhaustive list of GAN-related tips; you’ll find many more across the GAN literature:  tanh  sigmoid    Gaussian  , which is more  normal distribution   as the last activation in the generator, instead of   We use  commonly found in other types of models. We sample points from the latent space using a  distribution , not a uniform distribution. Stochasticity is good to induce robustness. Because GAN training results in a dynamic equilibrium, GANs are likely to get stuck in all sorts of ways. Introducing randomness during training helps prevent this. We introduce randomness in two ways: by using dropout in the discriminator and by adding random noise to the labels for the discriminator. Sparse gradients can hinder GAN training. In deep learning, sparsity is often a desirable property, but not in GANs. Two things can induce gradient sparsity: max pooling operations and ReLU activations. Instead of max pooling, we recommend using strided convolutions for downsampling, and we recommend using a  layer_activation_leaky_relu it relaxes sparsity constraints by allowing small negative activation values. In generated images, it’s common to see checkerboard artifacts caused by unequal coverage of the pixel space in the generator  see figure 8.17 . To fix this, we use a kernel size that is divisible by the stride size whenever we use a strided    instead of a ReLU activation.

One of the many issues that commonly arise with GANs is that the generator gets stuck with generated images that look like noise. A possible solution is to use dropout on both the discriminator and the generator.

Can you tell them apart?  Answers: the real images in each column are middle, top, bottom, middle.   8.5.7 Wrapping up  A GAN consists of a generator network coupled with a discriminator network. The discriminator is trained to tell apart the output of the generator and real images from a training dataset, and the generator is trained to fool the discriminator. Remarkably, the generator nevers sees images from the training set directly; the information it has about the data comes from the discriminator. GANs are difficult to train, because training a GAN is a dynamic process rather than a simple descent process with a fixed loss landscape. Getting a GAN to train correctly requires using a number of heuristic tricks, as well as extensive tuning. GANs can potentially produce highly realistic images. But unlike VAEs, the latent space they learn doesn’t have a neat continuous structure and thus may not be suited for certain practical applications, such as image editing via latent-space concept vectors.  8.6 Summary  With creative applications of deep learning, deep nets go beyond annotating existing content and start generating their own.

This last chapter will summarize and review core concepts while also expanding your horizons beyond the relatively basic notions you’ve learned so far. Understanding deep learning and AI is a journey, and finishing this book is merely the first step of it. I want to make sure you realize this and are properly equipped to take the next steps of this journey on your own.  We’ll start with a bird’s-eye view of what you should take away from this book. This should refresh your memory regarding some of the concepts you’ve learned. Next, we’ll present  an  overview  of  some  key  limitations  of  deep  learning.  To  use  a  tool appropriately, you should not only understand what it   do but also be aware of what it can’t  do. Finally, I’ll offer some speculative thoughts about the future evolution of the fields of deep learning, machine learning, and AI. This should be especially interesting to you if you’d like to get into fundamental research. The chapter ends with a short list of resources and strategies for learning further about AI and staying up to date with new advances.  can  9.1 Key concepts in review  This section briefly synthesizes the key take-aways from this book.

Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  306   9.1.1 Different types of approaches to AI  First of all, deep learning isn’t synonymous with AI or even with machine learning.  Artificial  intelligence   is  an  ancient,  broad  field  that  can  generally  be  defined  as  "all attempts to automate cognitive processes"—in other words, the automation of thought. This can range from the very basic, such as an Excel spreadsheet, to the very advanced, like a humanoid robot that can walk and talk.  Machine learning is a specific subfield of AI that aims at automatically developing   purely from exposure to training data. This process of turning .

These  operations  are :  deep-learning  models  are  typically  stacks  of structured  into  modules  called  weights layers—or, more generally, graphs of layers. These layers are parametrized by  , which are the parameters learned during training. The   of a model is stored in its weights, and the process of learning consists of finding good values for these weights. Even though deep learning is just one approach to machine learning among many, it isn’t on an equal footing with the others. Deep learning is a breakout success. Here’s why.  knowledge  9.1.2 What makes deep learning special within the field of machine learning In the span of only a few years, deep learning has achieved tremendous breakthroughs across a wide range of tasks that have been historically perceived as extremely difficult for computers, especially in the area of machine perception: extracting useful information from  images,  videos,  sound,  and  more.  Given  sufficient  training  data   in  particular, training data appropriately labeled by humans , it’s possible to extract from perceptual data almost anything that a human could extract. Hence it’s sometimes said that deep learning has  , although that is true only for a fairly narrow definition of  perception .  solved perception  AI summer  Due  to  its  unprecedented  technical  successes,  deep  learning  has  singlehandedly brought about the third and by far the largest  : a period of intense interest, investment, and hype in the field of AI. As this book is being written, we’re in the middle of it. Whether this period will end in the near future, and what happens after it ends, is a topic of debate. One thing is certain: in stark contrast with previous AI summers, deep learning  has  provided  enormous  business  value  to  a  number  of  large  technology companies,  enabling  human-level  speech  recognition,  smart  assistants,  human-level image classification, vastly improved machine translation, and more. The hype may  and likely will  recede, but the sustained economic and technological impact of deep learning will remain. In that sense, deep learning could be analogous to the internet: it may be overly hyped up for a few years, but in the longer term it will still be a major revolution that will transform our economy and our lives.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  307   9.1.3 How to think about deep learning  I’m particularly optimistic about deep learning because even if we were to make no further technological progress in the next decade, deploying existing algorithms to every applicable problem would already be a game changer for most industries. Deep learning is nothing short of a revolution, and progress is currently happening at an incredibly fast rate, due to an exponential investment in resources and headcount. From where I stand, the future looks bright, although short-term expectations are somewhat over-optimistic; deploying deep learning to the full extent of its potential will take well over a decade.  The most surprising thing about deep learning is how simple it is. Ten years ago, no one expected that we would achieve such amazing results on machine-perception problems by using simple parametric models trained with gradient descent. Now, it turns out that all  you  need  is  sufficiently  large  parametric  models  trained  with  gradient  descent  on sufficiently  many  examples.  As  Feynman  once  said  about  the  universe,  "It’s  not complicated, it’s just a lot of it."32 Footnote 32mRichard Feynman, interview,  1972.  The World from Another Point of View  , Yorkshire Television,  point   in a   vectorized  . Model inputs  text, images, and so on  and targets are first   In deep learning, everything is a vector: that is, everything is a   geometric space : turned into an initial input vector space and target vector space. Each layer in a deep-learning model operates one simple geometric transformation on the data that goes through it. Together, the chain of layers in the model forms one complex geometric transformation, broken down into a series of simple ones. This complex transformation attempts to map the input space to the target space, one point at a time. This transformation is parametrized by the weights  of  the  layers,  which  are  iteratively  updated  based  on  how  well  the  model  is currently performing. A key characteristic of this geometric transformation is that it must be  , which is required in order for us to be able to learn its parameters via gradient descent. Intuitively, this means the geometric morphing from inputs to outputs must be smooth and continuous—a significant constraint.  differentiable  The entire process of applying this complex geometric transformation to the input data can be visualized in 3D by imagining a person trying to uncrumple a paper ball: the crumpled paper ball is the manifold of the input data that the model starts with. Each movement  operated  by  the  person  on  the  paper  ball  is  similar  to  a  simple  geometric transformation  operated  by  one  layer.  The  full  uncrumpling  gesture  sequence  is  the complex  transformation  of  the  entire  model.  Deep-learning  models  are  mathematical machines for uncrumpling complicated manifolds of high-dimensional data.  That’s  the  magic  of  deep  learning:  turning  meaning  into  vectors,  into  geometric spaces, and then incrementally learning complex geometric transformations that map one space to another. All you need are spaces of sufficiently high dimensionality in order to capture the full scope of the relationships found in the original data.  The  whole  thing  hinges  on  a  single  core  idea:  that  meaning  is  derived  from  the   between words in a language, between pixels in an  pairwise relationship between things  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  308   these relationships can be captured by a distance function image, and so on  and that  . But note that whether the brain implements meaning via geometric spaces is an entirely separate  question.  Vector  spaces  are  efficient  to  work  with  from  a  computational standpoint,  but  different  data  structures  for  intelligence  can  easily  be  envisioned—in particular, graphs. Neural networks initially emerged from the idea of using graphs as a ; the surrounding way to encode meaning, which is why they’re named  neural network field of research used to be called  exists purely for historical reasons—it’s an extremely misleading name because, they’re neither neural nor networks. In particular, neural networks have hardly anything to do with  the  brain.

Rather,  like  any  other  revolution,  it’s  the  product  of  a  vast accumulation of enabling factors—slowly at first, and then all of a sudden. In the case of deep learning, we can point out the following key factors:  Incremental algorithmic innovations, first spread over two decades  starting with backpropagation  and then happening increasingly faster as more research effort was poured into deep learning after 2012. The availability of large amounts of perceptual data, which is a requirement in order to realize that sufficiently large models trained on sufficiently large data are all we need. This is in turn a byproduct of the rise of the consumer internet and Moore’s law applied to storage media. The availability of fast, highly parallel computation hardware at a low price, especially the GPUs produced by NVIDIA—first gaming GPUs and then chips designed from the ground up for deep learning. Early on, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang took note of the deep-learning boom and decided to bet the company’s future on it. A complex stack of software layers that makes this computational power available to humans: the CUDA language, frameworks like TensorFlow that do automatic differentiation, and Keras, which makes deep learning accessible to most people.  In the future, deep learning will not only be used by specialists—researchers, grad students, and engineers with an academic profile—but will also be a tool in the toolbox of every developer, much like web technology today. Everyone needs to build intelligent apps:  just  as  every  business  today  needs  a  website,  every  product  will  need  to intelligently make sense of user-generated data. Bringing about this future will require us to build tools that make deep learning radically easy to use and accessible to anyone with basic coding abilities. Keras is the first major step in that direction.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  309   9.1.5 The universal machine-learning workflow  Having  access  to  an  extremely  powerful  tool  for  creating  models  that  map  any  input space to any target space is great, but the difficult part of the machine-learning workflow is  often  everything  that  comes  before  designing  and  training  such  models   and,  for production models, what comes after, as well . Understanding the problem domain so as to be able to determine what to attempt to predict, given what data, and how to measure success, is a prerequisite for any successful application of machine learning, and it isn’t something  that  advanced  tools  like  Keras  and  TensorFlow  can  help  you  with.  As  a reminder, here’s a quick summary of the typical machine-learning workflow as described in chapter 4:  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  Define the problem: what data is available, and what are you trying to predict? Will you need to collect more data or hire people to manually label a dataset? Identify a way to reliably measure success on your goal. For simple tasks, this may be prediction accuracy, but in many cases it will require sophisticated domain-specific metrics. Prepare the validation process that you’ll use to evaluate your models. In particular, you should define a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The validation- and test-set labels shouldn’t leak into the training data: for instance, with temporal prediction, the validation and test data should be posterior to the training data. Vectorize the data by turning it into vectors and preprocessing it in a way that makes it more easily approachable by a neural network  normalization, and so on . Develop a first model that beats a trivial common-sense baseline, thus demonstrating that machine learning can work on your problem. This may not always be the case! Gradually refine your model architecture by tuning hyperparameters and adding regularization. Make changes based on performance on the validation data only, not the test data or the training data. Remember that you should get your model to overfit  thus identifying a model capacity level that is greater than you need  and only then begin to add regularization or downsize your model. Be aware of validation-set overfitting when turning hyperparameters: that is, the fact that your hyperparameters may end up being over-specialized to the validation set. Avoiding this is the purpose of having a separate test set!  9.1.6 Key network architectures  ,   The three families of network architectures that you should be familiar with are densely connected  networks convolutional  networks .  Each  type  of network  is  meant  for  a  specific  input  modality:  a  network  architecture   dense, convolutional,  recurrent   encodes    about  the  structure  of  the  data:  a  hypothesis  space   within  which  the  search  for  a  good  model  will  proceed.  Whether  a given architecture will work on a given problem depends entirely on the match between the structure of the data and the assumptions of the network architecture.  recurrent  networks  assumptions  ,  and   These different network types can easily be combined to achieve larger multimodal networks, much as you combine LEGO bricks. In a way, deep-learning layers are LEGO bricks  for  information  processing.  Here  is  a  quick  overview  of  the  mapping  between input modalities and appropriate network architectures:  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  310   Vector data—Densely connected network  dense layers . Image data—2D convnets. Sound data  for example, waveform —Either 1D convnets  preferred  or RNNs. Text data—Either 1D convnets  preferred  or RNNs. Timeseries data—Either RNNs  preferred  or 1D convnets. Other types of sequence data—Either RNNs or 1D convnets. Prefer RNNs if data ordering is strongly meaningful  for example, for timeseries, but not for text . Video data—Either 3D convnets  if you need to capture motion effects  or a combination of a frame-level convnet for feature extraction followed by either an RNN or a 1D convnet to process the resulting sequences. Volumetric data—3D convnets.  Now, let’s quickly review the specificities of each network architecture.  DENSELY CONNECTED NETWORKS A densely connected network is a stack of dense layers, meant to process vector data  batches of vectors . Such networks assume no specific structure in the input features: they’re called   because the units of a dense layer are connected to every other unit. The layer attempts to map relationships between any two input features; this is unlike a 2D convolution layer, for instance, which only looks at   densely connected   relationships.  local  Densely  connected  networks  are  most  commonly  used  for  categorical  data   for example, where the input features are lists of attributes , such as the Boston Housing dataset used in chapter 3. They’re also used as the final classification or regression stage of most networks. For instance, the convnets covered in chapter 5 typically end with one or two dense layers, and so do the recurrent networks in chapter 6.

Remember, building deep-learning models is like  playing  with  LEGO  bricks:  layers  can  be  plugged  together  to  map  essentially anything to anything, given that you have appropriate training data available and that the mapping  is  achievable  via  a  continuous  geometric  transformation  of  reasonable complexity. The space of possibilities is infinite. This section offers a few examples to inspire  you  to  think  beyond  the  basic  classification  and  regression  tasks  that  have traditionally been the bread and butter of machine learning.  I’ve sorted my suggested applications by input and output modalities. Note that quite a few of them stretch the limits of what is possible—although a model could be trained on all of these tasks, in some cases such a model probably wouldn’t generalize far from its training data. Sections 9.2 and 9.3 will address how these limitations could be lifted in the future.

Let’s  see  in  the  next  section  what we   can’t   do with deep learning.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  315   9.2 The limitations of deep learning  The space of applications that can be implemented with deep learning is nearly infinite. And  yet,  many  applications  are  completely  out  of  reach  for  current  deep-learning techniques—even given vast amounts of human-annotated data. Say, for instance, that you  could  assemble  a  dataset  of  hundreds  of  thousands—even  millions—of  English language  descriptions  of  the  features  of  a  software  product,  written  by  a  product manager, as well as the corresponding source code developed by a team of engineers to meet these requirements. Even with this data, you could   train a deep-learning model to  read  a  product  description  and  generate  the  appropriate  codebase.  That’s  just  one example among many. In general, anything that requires reasoning—like programming or  applying  the  scientific  method—long-term  planning,  and  algorithmic-like  data manipulation is out of reach for deep-learning models, no matter how much data you throw  at  them.  Even  learning  a  sorting  algorithm  with  a  deep  neural  network  is tremendously difficult.  not  This is because a deep-learning model is just a chain of simple, continuous geometric transformations  mapping one vector space into another. All it can do is map one data manifold X into another manifold Y, assuming the existence of a learnable continuous transform from X to Y. A deep-learning model can be interpreted as a kind of program; but,  inversely,  —for  most tasks, either there exists no corresponding deep-neural network that solves the task or, even if one exists, it may not be  : the corresponding geometric transform may be far too complex, or there may not be appropriate data available to learn it.  most  programs  can’t  be  expressed  as  deep-learning  models  learnable  Scaling up current deep-learning techniques by stacking more layers and using more training data can only superficially palliate some of these issues. It won’t solve the more fundamental problems that deep-learning models are limited in what they can represent and that most of the programs you may wish to learn can’t be expressed as a continuous geometric morphing of a data manifold.  9.2.1 The risk of anthropomorphizing machine-learning models  One real risk with contemporary AI is misinterpreting what deep-learning models do and overestimating their abilities. A fundamental feature of humans is our  : our tendency to project intentions, beliefs, and knowledge on the things around us. Drawing a smiley  face  on  a  rock  suddenly  makes  it  "happy"—in  our  minds.  Applied  to  deep learning, this means that, for instance, when we’re able to somewhat successfully train a model  to  generate  captions  to  describe  pictures,  we’re  led  to  believe  that  the  model "understands"  the  contents  of  the  pictures  and  the  captions  it  generates.  Then  we’re surprised when any slight departure from the sort of images present in the training data causes the model to generate completely absurd captions  see figure 9.1 .  theory of mind  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  316   Figure 9.1 Failure of a deep learning-based image captioning system  adversarial examples  In particular, this is highlighted by   , which are samples fed to a deep-learning  network  that  are  designed  to  trick  the  model  into  misclassifying  them. You’re already aware that, for instance, it’s possible to do gradient ascent in input space to generate inputs that maximize the activation of some convnet filter—this is the basis of the  filter-visualization  technique  introduced  in  chapter  5,  as  well  as  the  DeepDream algorithm in chapter 8. Similarly, through gradient ascent, you can slightly modify an image in order to maximize the class prediction for a given class. By taking a picture of a panda and adding to it a gibbon gradient, we can get a neural network to classify the panda as a gibbon  see figure 9.2 . This evidences both the brittleness of these models and  the  deep  difference  between  their  input-to-output  mapping  and  our  human perception.  Figure 9.2 An adversarial example: imperceptible changes in an image can upend a model’s classification of the image.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  317   In short, deep-learning models don’t have any understanding of their input—at least, not  in  any  human  sense.  Our  own  understanding  of  images,  sounds,  and  language  is grounded in our sensorimotor experience as humans. Machine-learning models have no access to such experiences and thus can’t understand their inputs in a human-relatable way. By annotating large numbers of training examples to feed into our models, we get them to learn a geometric transform that maps data to human concepts on a specific set of examples, but this mapping is a simplistic sketch of the original model in our minds—the one developed from our experience as embodied agents. It’s like a dim image in a mirror  see figure 9.3 .  Figure 9.3 Current machine-learning models: like a dim image in a mirror  As a machine-learning practitioner, always be mindful of this, and never fall into the trap of believing that neural networks understand the task they perform—they don’t, at least not in a way that would make sense to us. They were trained on a different, far narrower task than the one we wanted to teach them: that of mapping training inputs to training  targets,  point  by  point.  Show  them  anything  that  deviates  from  their  training data, and they will break in absurd ways.  9.2.2 Local generalization vs. extreme generalization  There are fundamental differences between the straightforward geometric morphing from input to output that deep-learning models do, and the way humans think and learn. It isn’t only the fact that humans learn by themselves from embodied experience instead of being presented with explicit training examples. In addition to the different learning processes, there is a basic difference in the nature of the underlying representations.  Humans  are  capable  of  far  more  than  mapping  immediate  stimuli  to  immediate responses,  as  a  deep  net,  or  maybe  an  insect,  would.  We  maintain  complex,  abstract models  of our current situation, of ourselves, of other people, and can use these models to anticipate  different  possible  futures  and  perform  long-term  planning.  We  can  merge together known concepts to represent something we’ve never experienced before—like picturing a horse wearing jeans, for instance, or imagining what we’d do if we won the lottery.  This  ability  to  handle  hypotheticals,  to  expand  our  mental  model  space  far beyond  what  we  can  experience  directly—to  perform  —is  abstraction  reasoning    and   Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  318   extreme generalization arguably the defining characteristic of human cognition. I call it  : an ability to adapt to novel, never-before-experienced situations using little data or even no new data at all.  This stands in sharp contrast with what deep nets do, which I call local generalization  see figure 9.4 . The mapping from inputs to outputs performed by a deep net quickly stops making sense if new inputs differ even slightly from what the net saw at training time. Consider, for instance, the problem of learning the appropriate launch parameters to get a rocket to land on the moon. If you used a deep net for this task and trained it using supervised learning or reinforcement learning, you’d have to feed it thousands or even millions of launch trials: you’d need to expose it to a   of the input space, in order for it to learn a reliable mapping from input space to output space. In contrast, humans  can  use  our  power  of  abstraction  to  come  up  with  physical  models—rocket science—and derive an   solution that will get the rocket on the moon in one or a few trials. Similarly, if you developed a deep net controlling a human body, and you wanted it to learn to safely navigate a city without getting hit by cars, the net would have to die many thousands of times in various situations until it could infer that cars are dangerous and develop appropriate avoidance behaviors. Dropped into a new city, the net would have to relearn most of what it knows. On the other hand, humans are able to learn safe behaviors  without  having  to  die  even  once—again,  thanks  to  our  power  of  abstract modeling of hypothetical situations.  dense sampling  exact  Figure 9.4 Local generalization vs. extreme generalization  In short, despite our progress on machine perception, we’re still far from human-level AI. Our models can only perform local generalization, adapting to new situations that must  be  similar  to  past  data,  whereas  human  cognition  is  capable  of  extreme  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  319   generalization, quickly adapting to radically novel situations and planning for long-term future situations. 9.2.3 Wrapping up  Here’s what you should remember: the only real success of deep learning so far has been the ability to map space X to space Y using a continuous geometric transform, given large amounts of human-annotated data. Doing this well is a game-changer for essentially every industry, but it’s still a long way from human-level AI.   and   abstraction  To lift some of these limitations and begin to have AI complete with human brains, we  need  to  move  away  from  straightforward  input-to-output  mappings  and  on  to  reasoning . A likely appropriate substrate for abstract modeling of various situations  and  concepts  is  that  of  computer  programs.  We  said  previously  that machine-learning models can be defined as  ; currently we can only learn programs that belong to a narrow and specific subset of all possible programs. But what if we could learn   program, in a modular and reusable way? Let’s see in the next section what the road ahead may look like.  learnable programs  any  9.3 The future of deep learning  This is a more speculative section aimed at opening horizons for people who want to join a research program or begin doing independent research. Given what we know of how deep nets work, their limitations, and the current state of the research landscape, can we predict where things are headed in the medium term? Following are some purely personal thoughts. Note that I don’t have a crystal ball, so a lot of what I anticipate may fail to become reality. I’m sharing these predictions not because I expect them to be proven completely  right  in  the  future,  but  because  they’re  interesting  and  actionable  in  the present.  At a high level, these are the main directions in which I see promise:  , the lack of which is the fundamental weakness of current models.  Models closer to general-purpose computer programs, built on top of far richer primitives than the current differentiable layers. This is how we’ll get to  abstraction New forms of learning that make the previous point possible, allowing models to move away from differentiable transforms. Models that require less involvement from human engineers. It shouldn’t be your job to tune knobs endlessly. Greater, systematic reuse of previously learned features and architectures, such as metalearning systems based on reusable and modular program subroutines.  reasoning   and   Additionally, note that these considerations aren’t specific to the sort of supervised learning  that  has  been  the  bread  and  butter  of  deep  learning  so  far—rather,  they’re applicable to any form of machine learning, including unsupervised, self-supervised, and reinforcement learning. It isn’t fundamentally important where your labels come from or what  your  training  loop  looks  like;  these  different  branches  of  machine  learning  are different facets of the same construct. Let’s dive in.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  320   9.3.1 Models as programs   and   reasoning   that can achieve   local generalization   and can only achieve   As noted in the previous section, a necessary transformational development that we can expect in the field of machine learning is a move away from models that perform purely  pattern recognition , toward models capable of  abstraction . Current AI programs that are capable of basic forms of reasoning are all hard-coded by human programmers: for instance, software that relies on search algorithms, graph manipulation, and formal logic.  In  DeepMind’s  AlphaGo,  for  example,  most  of  the  intelligence  on  display  is designed and hard-coded by expert programmers  such as the Monte Carlo Tree Search ; learning from data happens only in specialized submodules  value networks and policy networks .  But  in  the  future,  such  AI  systems  may  be  fully  learned,  with  no  human involvement.  extreme generalization  for   loop  repeatedly applied inside a   What path could make this happen? Consider a well-known type of network: RNNs. It’s  important  to  note  that  RNNs  have  slightly  fewer  limitations  than  feedforward networks. That is because RNNs are a bit more than mere geometric transformations: they’re geometric transformations  . The temporal    loop  is  itself  hard-coded  by  human  developers:  it’s  a  built-in  assumption  of  the for network. Naturally, RNNs are extremely limited in what they can represent, primarily because each step they perform is still a differentiable geometric transformation, and they carry  information  from  step  to  step  via  points  in  a  continuous  geometric  space   state vectors .  Now  imagine  a  neural  network  that  is  augmented  in  a  similar  way  with programming primitives—but instead of a single hard-coded   loop with hard-coded geometric memory, the network includes a large set of programming primitives that the model  is  free  to  manipulate  to  expand  its  processing  function,  such  as    branches,    statements,  variable  creation,  disk  storage  for  long-term  memory,  sorting while operators,  advanced  data  structures   such  as  lists,  graphs,  and  hash  tables ,  and  many more. The space of programs that such a network could represent would be far broader than  what  can  be  represented  with  current  deep-learning  models,  and  some  of  these programs could achieve superior generalization power.  for  if  We’ll  move  away  from  having,  on  one  hand,  hard-coded  algorithmic  intelligence  handcrafted  software   and,  on  the  other  hand,  learned  geometric  intelligence   deep learning .  Instead,  we’ll  have  a  blend  of  formal  algorithmic  modules  that  provide reasoning  and  abstraction  capabilities,  and  geometric  modules  that  provide  informal intuition and pattern-recognition capabilities. The entire system will be learned with little or no human involvement.  A related subfield of AI that I think may be about to take off in a big way is program synthesis ,  in  particular  neural  program  synthesis.  Program  synthesis  consists  of automatically generating simple programs by using a search algorithm  possibly genetic search, as in genetic programming  to explore a large space of possible programs. The search  stops  when  a  program  is  found  that  matches  the  required  specifications,  often provided as a set of input-output pairs. This is highly reminiscent of machine learning:  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  321   given training data provided as input-output pairs, we find a program that matches inputs to outputs and can generalize to new inputs. The difference is that instead of learning parameter values in a hard-coded program  a neural network , we generate source code via a discrete search process.  I definitely expect this subfield to see a wave of renewed interest in the next few years. In particular, I expect the emergence of a crossover subfield between deep learning and  program  synthesis,  where  instead  of  generating  programs  in  a  general-purpose language, we’ll generate neural networks  geometric data-processing flows  augmented with a rich set of algorithmic primitives, such as   loops and many others  see figure 9.5 . This should be far more tractable and useful than directly generating source code, and it will dramatically expand the scope of problems that can be solved with machine learning—the space of programs that we can generate automatically given appropriate training data. Contemporary RNNs can be seen as a prehistoric ancestor of such hybrid algorithmic-geometric models.  for  Figure 9.5 A learned program relying on both geometric  pattern recognition, intuition  and algorithmic  reasoning, search, memory  primitives  9.3.2 Beyond backpropagation and differentiable layers  If machine-learning models become more like programs, then they will mostly no longer be  differentiable—these  programs  will  still  use  continuous  geometric  layers  as subroutines, which will be differentiable, but the model as a whole won’t be. As a result, using backpropagation to adjust weight values in a fixed, hard-coded network can’t be the method of choice for training models in the future—at least, it can’t be the entire story.  We  need  to  figure  out  to  train  non-differentiable  systems  efficiently.

To make something more efficient, there  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  322   9.3.3 Automated machine learning  is  one  universal  recipe:  introduce  modularity  and  hierarchy.  So  we  can  make backpropagation  more  efficient  by  introducing  decoupled  training  modules  with  a synchronization  mechanism  between  them,  organized  in  a  hierarchical  fashion.  This strategy  is  somewhat  reflected  in  DeepMind’s  recent  work  on  synthetic  gradients.  I expect more more work along these lines in the near future. I can imagine a future where models  that  are  globally  non-differentiable   but  feature  differentiable  parts   are trained—grown—using an efficient search process that doesn’t use gradients, whereas the differentiable parts are trained even faster by taking advantage of gradients using a more efficient version of backpropagation.  In  the  future,  model  architectures  will  be  learned  rather  than  being  handcrafted  by engineer-artisans. Learning architectures goes hand in hand with the use of richer sets of primitives and program-like machine-learning models.  Currently, most of the job of a deep-learning engineer consists of munging data and then tuning the architecture and hyperparameters of a deep network at length to get a working model—or even to get a state-of-the-art model, if the engineer is that ambitious. Needless  to  say,  that  isn’t  an  optimal  setup.  But  AI  can  help.  Unfortunately,  the data-munging part is tough to automate, because it often requires domain knowledge as well  as  a  clear,  high-level  understanding  of  what  the  engineer  wants  to  achieve. Hyperparameter tuning, however, is a simple search procedure; and in that case we know what the engineer wants to achieve: it’s defined by the loss function of the network being tuned. It’s already common practice to set up basic   systems that take care of most model knob tuning. I even set up my own, years ago, to win Kaggle competitions.  AutoML  At the most basic level, such a system would tune the number of layers in a stack, their order, and the number of units or filters in each layer. This is commonly done today, which we discussed in chapter 7. But we can also be far more ambitious and attempt to learn an appropriate architecture from scratch, with as few constraints as possible: for instance, via reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms.  Another  important  AutoML  direction  involves  learning  model  architecture  jointly with model weights. Because training a new model from scratch every time we try a slightly  different  architecture  is  tremendously  inefficient,  a  truly  powerful  AutoML system would evolve architectures at the same time the features of the model were being tuned via backpropagation on the training data. Such approaches are beginning to emerge at the time of writing.  When  this  starts  to  happen,  the  jobs  of  machine-learning  engineers  won’t disappear—rather, engineers will move up the value-creation chain. They will begin to put much more effort into crafting complex loss functions that truly reflect business goals and  understanding  how  their  models  impact  the  digital  ecosystems  in  which  they’re deployed  for example, the users who consume the model’s predictions and generate the model’s training data  —problems that only the largest companies can afford to consider at present.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  323   9.3.4 Lifelong learning and modular subroutine reuse  If models become more complex and are built on top of richer algorithmic primitives, then  this  increased  complexity  will  require  higher  reuse  between  tasks,  rather  than training a new model from scratch every time we have a new task or a new dataset. Many datasets don’t contain enough information for us to develop a new, complex model from scratch, and it will be necessary to use information from previously encountered datasets  much as you don’t learn English from scratch every time you open a new book—that would be impossible . Training models from scratch on every new task is also inefficient due to the large overlap between the current tasks and previously encountered tasks.  A remarkable observation has been made repeatedly in recent years: training the same model to do several loosely connected tasks at the same time results in a model that is  better at each task . For instance, training the same neural machine-translation model to perform both English-to-German translation and French-to-Italian translation will result in a model that is better at each language pair. Similarly, training an image-classification model jointly with an image-segmentation model, sharing the same convolutional base, results in a model that is better at both tasks. This is fairly intuitive: there is always some information overlap between seemingly disconnected tasks, and a joint model has access to a greater amount of information about each individual task than a model trained on that specific task only.  Currently, when it comes to model reuse across tasks, we use pretrained weights for models that perform common functions, such as visual feature extraction. You saw this in action  in  chapter  5.  In  the  future,  I  expect  a  generalized  version  of  this  to  be commonplace: we will use not only previously learned features  submodel weights  but also model architectures and training procedures. As models become more like programs, we’ll begin to reuse   like the functions and classes found in human programming languages.  program subroutines  Think  of  the  process  of  software  development  today:  once  an  engineer  solves  a specific problem  HTTP queries, for instance , they package it as an abstract, reusable library. Engineers who face a similar problem in the future will be able to search for existing libraries, download one, and use it in their own project. In a similar way, in the future, metalearning systems will be able to assemble new programs by sifting through a global  library  of  high-level  reusable  blocks.  When  the  system  finds  itself  developing similar program subroutines for several different tasks, it can come up with an abstract, reusable version of the subroutine and store it in the global library  see figure 9.6 . Such a process  will  implement  :  a  necessary  component  for  achieving  extreme generalization. A subroutine that is useful across different tasks and domains can be said to   some aspect of problem-solving. This definition of abstraction is similar to the notion of abstraction in software engineering. These subroutines can be either geometric  deep-learning  modules  with  pretrained  representations   or  algorithmic   closer  to  the libraries that contemporary software engineers manipulate .  abstraction  abstract  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  324   Figure 9.6 A meta-learner capable of quickly developing task-specific models using reusable primitives  both algorithmic and geometric , thus achieving extreme generalization  9.3.5 The long-term vision  In short, here is my long-term vision for machine learning:  grown  algorithmic modules geometric modules   automatically rather than hard-coded by human engineers,   providing formal reasoning, search,  providing informal intuition and  Models will be more like programs and will have capabilities that go far beyond the continuous geometric transformations of the input data we currently work with. These programs will arguably be much closer to the abstract mental models that humans maintain about their surroundings and themselves, and they will be capable of stronger generalization due to their rich algorithmic nature. In particular, models will blend  and abstraction capabilities with  pattern-recognition capabilities. AlphaGo  a system that required a lot of manual software engineering and human-made design decisions  provides an early example of what such a blend of symbolic and geometric AI could look like. Such models will be  using modular parts stored in a global library of reusable subroutines—a library evolved by learning high-performing models on thousands of previous tasks and datasets. As frequent problem-solving patterns are identified by the meta-learning system, they will be turned into reusable subroutines—much like functions and classes in software engineering—and added to the global library. This will achieve  This global library and associated model-growing system will be able to achieve some form of human-like extreme generalization: given a new task or situation, the system will be able to assemble a new working model appropriate for the task using very little data, thanks to rich program-like primitives that generalize well and extensive experience with similar tasks. In the same way, humans can quickly learn to play a complex new video game if they have experience with many previous games, because the models derived from this previous experience are abstract and program-like, rather than a basic mapping between stimuli and action. As such, this perpetually learning model-growing system can be interpreted as an  artificial general intelligence   AGI . But don’t expect any singularitarian robot apocalypse to ensue: that’s pure fantasy, coming from a long series of profound misunderstandings of both intelligence and technology. Such a critique, however, doesn’t belong in this book.  abstraction  .

The field of modern deep learning, as we know it today, is only a few years old, despite a long, slow prehistory stretching back decades. With an exponential increase in financial resources and research headcount since 2013, the field as a whole is now moving at a frenetic pace. What you’ve learned in this book won’t stay relevant forever, and it isn’t all you’ll need for the rest of your career.  Fortunately, there are plenty of free online resources that you can use to stay up to  date and expand your horizons. Here are a few.  9.4.1 Practice on real-world problems using Kaggle  kaggle.com  One  effective  way  to  acquire  real-world  experience  is  to  try  your  hand  at machine-learning competitions on Kaggle    . The only real way to learn is through  practice  and  actual  coding—that’s  the  philosophy  of  this  book,  and  Kaggle competitions  are  the  natural  continuation  of  this.  On  Kaggle,  you’ll  find  an  array  of constantly  renewed  data-science  competitions,  many  of  which  involve  deep  learning, prepared  by  companies  interested  in  obtaining  novel  solutions  to  some  of  their  most challenging machine-learning problems. Fairly large monetary prizes are offered to top entrants.  Most competitions are won using either the XGBoost library  for shallow machine learning  or Keras  for deep learning . So you’ll fit right in! By participating in a few competitions, maybe as part of a team, you’ll become more familiar with the practical side  of  some  of  the  advanced  best  practices  described  in  this  book,  especially hyperparameter tuning, avoiding validation-set overfitting, and model ensembling.  9.4.2 Read about the latest developments on arXiv  X  chi   stands for the Greek   Deep-learning  research,  in  contrast  with  some  other  scientific  fields,  takes  places completely in the open. Papers are made publicly and freely accessible as soon as they’re finalized, and a lot of related software is open source. arXiv  arxiv.org —pronounced "archive"  the   —is an open-access preprint server for physics, mathematics, and computer science research papers. It has become the de facto way to stay up to date on the bleeding edge of machine learning and deep learning. The large majority of deep-learning researchers upload any paper they write to arXiv shortly after completion. This allows them to plant a flag and claim a specific finding without waiting for a conference acceptance  which takes months , which is necessary given the fast pace of  research  and  the  intense  competition  in  the  field.  It  also  allows  the  field  to  move extremely fast: all new findings are immediately available for all to see and to build on.  An important downside is that the sheer quantity of new papers posted every day on arXiv  makes  it  impossible  to  even  skim  them  all;  and  the  fact  that  they  aren’t  peer reviewed makes it difficult to identify those that are both important and high quality. It’s difficult, and becoming increasingly more so, to find the signal in the noise. Currently,  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  326   there isn’t a good solution to this problem. But some tools can help: an auxiliary website called arXiv Sanity Preserver     serves as a recommendation engine for new papers and can help you keep track of new developments within a specific narrow vertical  of  deep  learning.  Additionally,  you  can  use  Google  Scholar  to  keep  track  of publications by your favorite authors. 9.4.3 Explore the Keras ecosystem  arxiv-sanity.com  With about 150,000 users as of June 2017, and growing fast, Keras has a large ecosystem of tutorials, guides, and related open source projects:  .  keras.io  keras.rstudio.com  , includes additional documentation and discussion.  Your main reference for working with the Keras R interface is the online documentation at The main Keras website,  The Keras for R source code can be found at  The Keras blog,  learning.

I hope you’ve learned a thing or two about This is the end of  machine learning, deep learning, Keras, and maybe even cognition in general. Learning is a lifelong journey, especially in the field of AI, where we have far more unknowns on our hands than certitudes. So please go on learning, questioning, and researching. Never stop. Because even given the progress made so far, most of the fundamental questions in AI remain unanswered. Many haven’t even been properly asked yet.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  327   A  Installing Keras and its dependencies on Ubuntu  This appendix provides a step-by-step guide to configuring a deep learning workstation with GPU support on Ubuntu. You can find details on other local GPU configurations at  tensorflow.rstudio.com tools local_gpu  .  A.1 Overview of the installation process  Before  beginning,  it’s  important  to  note  that  the  core  Keras  library  as  well  as  the TensorFlow back end are written in Python. The installation instructions below cover using    the Python package manager  to install Keras and it’s dependencies  including requisite NVIDIA GPU libraries .  pip  These instructions apply equally to the Keras R interface  since it in turn calls the core Keras library . Once these steps are completed, you can install the Keras R package with:  Listing A.1 Installing the Keras R package  install.packages "keras"   The process of setting up a deep learning workstation is fairly involved, and consists  of the following steps, which we will cover in detail:  1.  2.  3.  4. 5.  Install the Python scientific suite—Numpy and SciPy—and make sure you have a Basic Linear Algebra Subprogram  BLAS  library installed so your models run fast on the CPU. Install two extras packages that come in handy when using Keras: HDF5  for saving large neural-network files  and Graphviz  for visualizing neural-network architectures . Make sure your GPU can run deep-learning code, by installing CUDA drivers and cuDNN. Install a backend for Keras: TensorFlow, CTNK, or Theano. Install Keras.  It may seem like a daunting process. In fact, the only difficult part is setting up GPU support—otherwise, the entire process can be done in a few commands and takes only a couple of minutes.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  328   We’ll  assume  you  have  a  fresh  installation  of  Ubuntu,  with  an  NVIDIA  GPU   installed  and  that  your  package  pip  available.  Before  you  start,  make  sure  you  have  manager is up to date:  $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get upgrade $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev  A.2 Installing the Python scientific suite  If  you  use  a  Mac,  we  recommend  that  you  install  the  Python  scientific  suite  via Anaconda,  which  you  can  get  at  www.continuum.io downloads.  Note  that  this  won’t include HDF5 and Graphviz, which you have to install manually. Following are the steps for a    installation of the Python scientific suite on Ubuntu:  manual  1.  2.  3.  4.  Install a BLAS library  OpenBLAS in this case , to ensure that you can run fast tensor operations on your CPU: $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git unzip \      pkg-config libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev  Install the Python scientific suite: Numpy, SciPy and MatPlotLib. This is necessary in order to perform any kind of machine learning or scientific computing in Python, regardless of whether you’re doing deep learning: $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-yaml  Install HDF5. This library, originally developed by NASA, stores large files of numeric data in an efficient binary format. It will allow you to save your Keras models to disk quickly and efficiently: $ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev python-h5py  Install Graphviz and PyDot-ng, two packages that will let you visualize Keras models. They aren’t necessary to run Keras, so you could also skip this step and install these packages when you need them. Here are the commands: $ sudo apt-get install graphviz $ sudo pip install pydot-ng  5.  Install additional packages that are used in some of our code examples: $ sudo apt-get install python-opencv  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  329   A.3 Setting up GPU support  Using  a  GPU  isn’t  strictly  necessary,  but  it’s  strongly  recommended.  All  the  code examples found in this book can be run on a laptop CPU, but you may sometimes have to wait for several hours for a model to train, instead of mere minutes on a good GPU. If you don’t have a modern NVIDIA GPU, you can skip this step and go directly to section A.3.  In order to be able to use your NVIDIA GPU for deep learning, you need to install  two things:  CUDA—A set of drivers for your GPU that allows it to run a low-level programming language for parallel computing. cuDNN—A library of highly optimized primitives for deep learning. When using cuDNN and running on a GPU, you can typically increase the training speed of your models by 50% to 100%.  TensorFlow depends on particular versions of CUDA and the cuDNN library. At the time  of  writing,  it  uses  CUDA  version  8  and  cuDNN  version  6.  Please  consult  the TensorFlow  website  for  detailed  instructions  about  which  versions  are  currently recommended: www.tensorflow.org install install_linux.  Follow these steps:  Download CUDA. For Ubuntu  and other Linux flavors , NVIDIA provides a ready-to-use package that you can download from developer.nvidia.com cuda-downloads : $ wget http:  developer.download.nvidia.com compute cuda repos ubuntu1604  [CA]x86_64 cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_9.0.176-1_amd64.deb  Install CUDA. The easiest way to do so is to use Ubuntu’s  allow you to easily install updates via  $ sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_9.0.176-1_amd64.deb $ sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys [CA]http:  developer.download.nvidia.com compute cuda repos ubuntu1604  [CA]x86_64 7fa2af80.pub $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install cuda-8-0   as they become available:  apt  apt   on this package. This will  Install cuDNN.    select the version of cuDNN compatible with  Register for a free NVIDIA developer account  unfortunately, this is necessary in order to gain access to the cuDNN download , and download cuDNN at  developer.NVIDIA.com cudnn TensorFlow . Like CUDA, NVIDIA provides packages for different Linux flavors—we’ll use the version for Ubuntu 16.04. Note that if you’re working with an EC2 install, you won’t be able to download the cuDNN archive directly to your instanc instead, download it to your local machine and then upload it to your EC2 instance  via scp Install cuDNN: $ sudo dpkg -i dpkg -i libcudnn6*.deb   .  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  330   Installing TensorFlow TensorFlow  with  or  without  GPU  support  can  be  installed  from  PyPI  using  Pip.  Here’s the command without GPU support:  sudo pip install tensorflow  Here’s the command to install TensorFlow with GPU support:  sudo pip install tensorflow-gpu  A.4 Installing Theano  optional   Because you’ve already installed TensorFlow, you don’t have to install Theano in order to  run  Keras  code.  But  it  can  sometimes  be  useful  to  switch  back  and  forth  from TensorFlow to Theano when building Keras models.  Theano can also be installed from PyPI:  sudo pip install theano  If you’re using a GPU, then you should configure Theano to use your GPU. You can  create a Theano configuration file with this command:  Then, fill in the file with the following configuration:  nano ~ .theanorc  [global] floatX = float32 device = gpu0  [nvcc] fastmath = True  A.5 Installing Keras  You can install Keras from PyPI:  sudo pip install keras  Alternatively, you can install Keras from GitHub. Doing so will allow you to access  the keras examples folder, which contains many example scripts for you to learn from:  $ git clone https:  github.com fchollet keras $ cd keras $ sudo python setup.py install  You can now try to run a Keras script, such as this MNIST example:  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  331   python examples mnist_cnn.py  Note that running this example to completion may take a few minutes, so feel free to  force-quit it  Ctrl-C  once you’ve verified that it’s working nominally.  After you’ve run Keras at least once, the Keras configuration file can be found at , tensorflow  ~ .keras keras.json. You can edit it to select the backend that Keras runs on:  theano  . Your configuration file should like this:  , or   cntk  {     "image_data_format": "channels_last",     "epsilon": 1e-07,     "floatx": "float32",     "backend": "tensorflow" }  While  the  Keras  script  examples mnist_cnn.py  is  running,  you  can  monitor  GPU  utilization in a different shell window:  $ watch -n 5 NVIDIA-smi -a --display=utilization  You’re  all  set!  Congratulations—you  can  now  begin  building  deep-learning  applications.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  332   B  Running RStudio Server on a EC2 GPU instance  This appendix provides a step by step guide to start running deep learning within RStudio Server on an AWS GPU instance. This is the perfect setup for deep learning research if you do not have a GPU on your local machine. You can find details on other cloud GPU options at   tensorflow.rstudio.com tools cloud_gpu  .  B.1 Why would you want to use AWS for deep learning?  Many deep-learning applications are very computationally intensive and can take hours or even days when running on a laptop’s CPU cores. Running on a GPU can speed up training and inference by a considerable factor  often 5 to 10 times, when going from a modern CPU to a single modern GPU . But you may not have access to a GPU on your local  machine.  Running  RStudio  Server  on  AWS  gives  you  the  same  experience  as running on your local machine, while allowing you to use one or several GPUs on AWS. And you only pay for what you use, which can compare favorably to investing in your own GPU s  if you use deep learning only occasionally.  B.2 Why would you   not   want to use AWS for deep learning?  WS GPU instances can quickly become expensive. The one we suggest using costs $0.90 per  hour.  This  is  fine  for  occasional  use;  but  if  you’re  going  to  run  experiments  for several hours per day every day, then you’re better off building your own deep-learning machine with a Titan X or GTX 1080 Ti.  In summary, use the RStudio-Server-on-EC2 setup if you’re in one of the following  situations:  You don’t have access to a local GPU. You don’t want to deal with installing Keras dependencies, in particular GPU drivers.  If you have a access to a local GPU, we recommend running your models locally,  instead. In that case, use the installation guide in appendix A.  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  333   NOTE  You’ll need an active AWS account. Some familiarity with AWS EC2 will help, but it isn’t mandatory.  B.3 Setting up an AWS GPU instance  The following setup process will take 5 to 10 minutes:  Navigate to the EC2 control panel at  Launch Instance link  see figure B.1 .  console.aws.amazon.com ec2 v2  , and click the  Figure B.1 The EC2 control panel  Select AWS Marketplace  see figure B.2 , and search for "deep learning" in the search box. Scroll down until you find the AMI named Deep Learning AMI Ubuntu Version  see figure B.3 ; select it.  Figure B.2 The EC2 AMI Marketplace  Figure B.3 The EC2 Deep Learning AMI  Select the p2.xlarge instance  see figure B.4 . This instance type provides access to a single GPU and costs $0.90 per hour of usage  as of March 2017 .  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  334   Figure B.4 The p2.xlarge instance  You can keep the default configuration for the steps Configure Instance, Add Storage, Add Tags, and Configure Security Group.  NOTE  At the end of the launch process, you’ll be asked if you want to create new connection keys or if you want to reuse existing keys. If you’ve never used EC2 before, create new keys and download them.  To connect to your instance, select it on the EC2 control panel, click the Connect button, and follow the instructions  see figure B.6 . Note that it may take a few minutes for the instance to boot up. If you can’t connect at first, wait a bit and try again.  Next, you should install and configure R and RStudio Server. You can do this with  Figure B.5 Connection instructions  the following commands:  Listing B.1 Install R and RStudio Server   Install R sudo apt-get install r-base   Download RStudio Server and check MD5 sum wget https:  download2.rstudio.org rstudio-server-1.1.383-amd64.deb md5sum -c <<<"80cf85a6e0364a02a4e8d65f535dcc16 rstudio-server-1.1.383-amd64.deb"   Install RStudio Server  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  335   sudo apt-get install gdebi sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.1.383-amd64.deb   Configure RStudio to locate CUDA libraries CUDA=" usr local cuda lib64: usr local cuda extras CUPTI lib64" sudo  bin bash -c "echo 'rsession-ld-library-path=${CUDA}' >>  etc rstudio rserver.conf"   Add an interactive user for login to RStudio Server sudo adduser     Restart RStudio with new settings sudo rstudio-server restart  B.4 Installing Keras  You’re almost ready to start using RStudio Server. But first, you need to update Keras. A version of Keras is preinstalled on the AMI, but it may not necessarily be up to date. On the remote instance, run this command:  sudo pip install keras --upgrade  If there is an existing Keras configuration file on the instance  there shouldn’t be, but the AMI may have changed since we wrote this , you should delete it, just in case. Keras will re-create a standard configuration file when it’s launched for the first time.  If the following code snippet returns an error saying that the file doesn’t exist, you  can ignore it:  rm -f ~ .keras keras.json  B.5 Accessing RStudio Server  B.5.1 SSH Tunnel Access  We recommend that you use an SSH tunnel to access RStudio Server on the remote AMI. To configure this, first disable non-local access to RStudio Server with:   Configure RStudio to only allow local connections sudo  bin bash -c "echo 'www-address=127.0.0.1' >>  etc rstudio rserver.conf"   Restart RStudio with new settings sudo rstudio-server restart  Then, in a shell   on your local machine not       the remote instance , start forwarding  your local port 8787  the HTTP port  to port 8787 of the remote instance:  ssh -i awsKeys.pem -N -L local_port:local_machine:remote_port remote_machine  In our case, this looked like the following:  ssh -i awsKeys.pem -N -L 8787:127.0.0.1:8787 ubuntu@ec2-54-147-126-214.compute-1.amazonaws.com  Licensed to      https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  336   B.5.2 Plain HTTP Access  Then, in your local browser, navigate to the local address you’re forwarding to the  .  You’ll  be  asked  to  login  with  the  username  and  remote  instance    password you created when configuring RStudio Server.  127.0.0.1:8787  If  you  don’t  use  an  SSH  tunnel  then  you  can  access  the  server  at  port  8787  of  the instances public IP address. To do this you’ll need to create a custom TCP rule to allow port 8787   on your AWS instance.  This rule can be allowed either for your current public IP  such as that of your laptop  or for any IP  such as 0.0.0.0 0  if the former isn’t possible. Note that if you allow port 8888 for any IP, then literally anyone will be able to listen to that port on your instance  which is where you’ll be running RStudio Server . You added password protection to RStudio Server to mitigate the risk of random strangers using the server, but that may be pretty  weak  protection.  If  at  all  possible,  you  should  consider  restricting  access  to  a specific IP. But if your IP address changes constantly, then that isn’t a practical choice. If you’re going to leave access open to any IP, then remember not to leave sensitive data on the instance.  Figure B.6 Configure a new security group  Once  you’ve  configured  this  you  can  access  RStudio  Server  at  port  8787  of  the  public   instances  our  ec2-54-147-126-214.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8787 username and password you created when configuring RStudio Server .  address.   case   IP   In   that  would   be     you’ll be asked to login with the  https:  forums.manning.com forums deep-learning-with-r  337
